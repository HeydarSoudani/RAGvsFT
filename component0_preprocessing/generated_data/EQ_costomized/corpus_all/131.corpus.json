In the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, the people developed some large, dense cities and complexes featuring multiple mounds and, in some cases, thousands of residents. In what is known as the regional South Appalachian Mississippian culture, by contrast, settlements were smaller and the peoples typically built a single platform mound in the larger villages.\nSalvage archeological studies were conducted by Dr. Joseph Caldwell of the University of Georgia in 1957, prior to flooding of this area after construction of a dam downriver. He determined the first settlement was founded about 800 CE and lasted to 1700, when the village was burned. By that time, it was occupied by proto-Creek who were descendants of the Mississippians. Colonial maps until the American Revolution identified this village as one of the Hogeloge people, now known as Yuchi. While they later became allies of the Cherokee, they were of a different ethnicity and language group."

        "content": "Downtown Toccoa is located near the courthouse and the train depot, which connects to Atlanta. From the 1950s through the 1980s, business bustled in this \"mall.\" Each day, people would flood to shop in downtown Toccoa. Several national retail outlets were then located in downtown Toccoa, including the Belk Gallant department store.\nIn the early 1960s, around the country, local downtown businesses faced competition with large shopping malls, and many began to fail.  As an answer to the depressed conditions in downtowns, Toccoa and many other towns erected concrete canopies and closed streets to create a pedestrian mall. In less than ten years, it was evident that instead of enhancing businesses and creating a positive downtown image, these canopies actually accelerated the downtown's decline.\nWhen the Belk Gallant department store announced it was going to move along a four lane road called Big A, community leaders organized Main Street Toccoa in 1990. In 1991, the Georgia Department of Community Affairs Resource Team recommended that the canopies be removed and that the street be opened once again to vehicular traffic. However, for many years, the project was not supported.\nDuring that time, Main Street Toccoa implemented many changes and improvements to the downtown mall area. Brick pavers were installed and trees were planted. However, the canopies themselves began to deteriorate, and no support was found to repair them. During this time, businesses continued to flounder and many of the buildings were empty and in disrepair.\nOver time, however, with growing support, approval was given to start the canopy removal project. Efforts that helped contribute community support for the project included county-wide public surveys, a University of Georgia market study, a UGA design charrette, and renderings of individual buildings without the canopies provided by the GA Trust for Historic Preservation and UGA Community Design Planning and Preservation. To gather the necessary funds for the project, Toccoa partnered with six state agencies (Appalachian Regional Commission, Georgia Department of Community Affairs, One Georgia Authority, United States Department of Agriculture, and Georgia Department of Transportation) that provided $1.3 million, with additional local funding of $552,000.\n\nDuring the canopy removal and street re-opening project, private interest in downtown increased. In 2008, downtown saw 33 storefronts renovated, under the guidance of the Georgia Mountains Regional Development Center Historic Preservation Planner, 11 new business, 17 new jobs, 28 part-time jobs and 68 full-time equivalent jobs retained, and private investment of $3.5 million. Toccoa's Main Street was re-opened to vehicular traffic.\nThe Currahee Military Museum, featured recently in the PBS series GA Traveler, and named as one of the best museums along the East Coast by Blue Ridge Mountain Magazine, is another attraction that continues downtown's resurgence. Located in the restored historic train depot, the museum features a massive exhibit of 506's Easy Company memorabilia. This World War II paratrooper company was popularized by the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers. The depot housing this museum was recently restored to its pre-1940s appearance.  \nThe depot building had previously been used as a maintenance and storage area for Norfolk Southern. Now it has been transformed to a publicly owned building that is home to the Chamber, Welcome Center, Stephens County Historical Society Museum, the Currahee Military Museum, and Amtrak. Funding for the million dollar project was received through Transportation Enhancement Activity and GDOT funds of $400,000; local funding of $100,000 and private investment funds of over $500,000 were contributed. The museum just completed its second addition, funded by Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST).\nEnhancing Toccoa as a Northeast Georgia destination is the newly restored courthouse, which anchors the downtown district. The renovation project was overseen by a governmental appointed citizen authority.  Funded entirely by SPLOST dollars, the $2 million renovation project brought a historic 1907 building back to life while adding green space to the historic district and retained government offices and downtown customers in the city's square."

        "content": "In 1865 a competition for the design of a memorial to Queen Victoria's late Prince consort, Prince Albert, was won by W. J. Barre, who had earlier designed Belfast's Ulster Hall. Initially Barre was not awarded his prize and the contract was secretly given to Lanyon, Lynn, and Lanyon, who had come second. Following public outcry the contract was eventually awarded to Barre. The construction cost of \u00a32,500 (2011: \u00a3196,000) was raised by public subscription.The sandstone memorial was constructed between 1865 and 1869 by Fitzpatrick Brothers builders and stands 113 feet tall in a mix of French and Italian Gothic styles. The base of the tower features flying buttresses with heraldic lions. A statue of the Prince in the robes of a Knight of the Garter stands on the western side of the tower and was sculpted by SF Lynn. A two tonne bell is housed in the tower and the clock was made by Francis Moore of High Street, Belfast.As a result of being built on wooden piles on marshy, reclaimed land around the River Farset, the top of the tower leans four feet off the perpendicular. Due to this movement, some ornamental work on the belfry was removed in 1924 along with a stone canopy over the statue of the Prince. This gave rise to the expression that the tower \u201chas the time and the inclination.\u201d\nBeing situated close to the docks, the tower was once infamous for being frequented by prostitutes plying their trade with visiting sailors. However, in recent years regeneration has turned the surrounding Queen's Square and Custom's House Square into attractive, modern public spaces with trees, fountains and sculptures.The clock was damaged in a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb explosion outside nearby River House in High Street on 6 January 1992."

        "content": "Edwin Waller designed Congress to be Austin's most prominent thoroughfare in the 1830s. However, Congress did not extend south of the Colorado River until 1852 when James Gibson Swisher donated land for a road that was both the postal route to Austin and the main highway to San Antonio. Growth along South Congress slowed during the 19th century; it was not until the completion of a concrete bridge in 1910 that South Austin had reliable transportation over the river. Rapid growth finally came to South Austin in the 1920s, as the streetcar was expanded down South Congress. As hundreds of bungalows were built in South Austin, more commercial enterprises began appearing south of the river - especially on South Congress. By 1931, South Congress was finally paved all the way from the river to the railroad at present-day Ben White Boulevard.\nMany of South Congress's icons opened their doors between 1930 and 1960. The Austin Motel opened in 1938 and the Hotel San Jos\u00e9 shortly thereafter. The hamburger stand that would eventually become the legendary Night Hawk opened on South Congress in 1932. Another major development was the Twin Oaks Shopping Center at the northeast corner of Oltorf Road and South Congress. It was one of Austin's first \"strip\" shopping venues when it opened in 1954. South Austin opened further during the 1950s, as the Congress Avenue Bridge was widened and the construction of Interstate 35 provided an alternative north\u2013south route.During the 1970s, South Congress became a mecca for artists, musicians and their supporters. The legendary Armadillo World Headquarters opened at the corner of South Congress and Barton Springs Boulevard in 1970. Tourist traffic declined on South Congress with the rise of I-35 and many businesses fell into disrepair.By the late 1980s, small eclectic retailers began popping up along the South Congress Corridor, attracted by cheap rent. The area's renaissance began at the intersection of South Congress and Monroe by putting their historic buildings to good use to attract eclectic retail business, arts and music venues and restaurants in the area. South Austin's first skyscrapers appeared at South Congress and Riverside Drive when two new hotels opened. 1988 was a watershed moment for the area, as Kent Cole and Diana Prechter fixed a beat-up wood-frame building that had operated as Flossie's bar and the Austex Lounge, and reopened it as Magnolia Cafe South. They said they were attracted by the \"colorful people\" and cheap rent.Memories of drug dealers and prostitutes began to fade in the 1990s. Austin, a relatively small city for most of its history, suddenly enjoyed a tremendous economic boom that attracted new residents and drove an increased demand for older housing stock in the Travis Heights and Bouldin Creek neighborhoods. That in turn spurred massive renovation along South Congress and throughout old South Austin. The 1990s witnessed the redevelopment of the Austin Theatre, the H-E-B at Oltorf and South Congress and more. Perhaps the most ambitious renovation undertaken was the redevelopment of Penn Field from an industrial plant to a multi-use complex that includes office space, retail and residences. By the end of the decade, South Congress was well on its way to becoming a nationally known shopping and cultural district."

        "content": "Prosser was long home to Native Americans who lived and fished along the river.  They called the area \"T\u00e1ptat\" (alternatively spelled Tap-tat, Top tut, etc.), which translates to \"long hair in front, short hair on the sides\", referring to a style of headdress.Colonel William Farrand Prosser first surveyed the area in 1879, then claimed homestead in 1882.  The Northern Pacific Railroad laid tracks through the area two years later.  A town plat was filed by Colonel Prosser in 1885, and in 1886 he was elected Yakima County Auditor.  He moved to North Yakima to attend to these duties, and never returned to the town that he founded.\nLewis Hinzerling built a flour mill at Prosser falls in 1887, encouraging further settlement of the area.  The first irrigation canal was completed in 1893 by the Prosser Falls Land and Irrigation Company.  Prosser was officially incorporated in 1899 with a population of 229 people.\nIn 1905, Benton County was carved out of the eastern portions of Yakima and Klickitat Counties. The new town of Prosser was chosen as county seat. In 1907 a power plant was added and began delivering electricity to the town.  The following year, a new high school was built, followed a year later by a telephone exchange.  In 1910 the city received a grant from Andrew Carnegie for a public library.\nThroughout the 1910s and 1920s various companies drilled in this area for oil and natural gas. There were no large findings and the Great Depression put an end to exploration.\nOn November 5, 1912, Benton County voters held a referendum to move the county seat from Prosser to either Kennewick or Benton City.  Intense rivalry and war of words between Benton City, Kennewick, and Prosser preceded the vote. Despite getting a majority of the vote, Kennewick did not receive 60 percent of the vote as required by law.  To date, Prosser remains the county seat.\nIn 1919, Washington State College (later WSU) established the Irrigation Experiment Station at Prosser.  The program's mandate is to study the problems faced by farmers, orchardists, and ranchers in the dry central part of the state. The station originally employed scientists from the college in Pullman, who partnered with scientists from the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The station is still currently in use, and offers a number of agricultural education programs.\nProsser at one point had three newspapers, which were consolidated in the 1920s into the Prosser Record-Bulletin, and a permanent courthouse was built in 1926.  The Benton County Historical Museum was dedicated in 1968.In more recent years, Prosser's location on a major river (the Yakima) and highway access has encouraged a growing wine business and associated tourist industry.  Several Prosser wineries are located within the Yakima Valley appellation."

        "content": "Hafez was born in Shiraz in 1315 and died there in 1390.  A beloved figure of the Iranian people, who learn his verses by heart, Hafez was prominent in his home town and held a position as the court poet.  In his memory, a small, dome-like structure was erected in Shiraz near his grave at Golgast-e Mosalla in 1452, at the order of Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza, a Timurid governor.  The Golgast-e Mosalla were gardens (now known as Musalla Gardens) that featured in Hafiz's poetry.  With a surface of over 19,000 square metres, the gardens were also home to one of Shiraz's cemeteries, and Babur had a pool built here at the same time as the memorial.  Believing they were ordered by omens in Hafez's poetry, Abbas I of Persia and Nader Shah both carried out separate restoration projects in the following 300 years.\nA much more substantial memorial was constructed in the gardens in 1773, during the reign of Karim Khan Zand.  Situated on the north bank of the seasonal Rudkhaneye Khoshk river in the Musalla Gardens, the H\u0101fezieh consisted of four central columns, with two rooms built at the east and west end and with the north and south sides remaining open.  The building split the gardens into two regions, with the orange grove in the front and the cemetery in the back.  The actual tomb was outside of the structure, in the middle of the cemetery, with a marble slab placed over the grave.  The marble was engraved by a calligrapher with excerpts from Hafez's poetry.The tomb was restored in 1857, by a governor of Fars, and a wooden enclosure was built around the tomb in 1878, by another governor of Fars.  Following this, the site became a subject of controversy, when, in 1899, Ardeshir, a Parsi from India began to build a shrine around Hafez's grave.  Although the philanthropist Parsi had obtained permission from an ulema of Shiraz to build the iron and wood shrine, a doctor of religious law with some authority in Shiraz, \u02bfAli-Akbar F\u0101l-Asiri, objected to a Zoroastrian building over the grave of a Muslim.  With his followers, he destroyed the half-built construction.  The people of Shiraz protested the destruction and the government ordered the rebuilding of the monument, but F\u0101l-Asiri opposed them and pronounced that he would destroy any building raised there, even if it were erected by the king himself.\nThe site remained in ruins for two years, until 1901 when Prince Malek Mansur Mirza Shao es-Saltaneh placed a decorative iron transenna around Hafez's tomb.  It was inscribed with verse and the names of the patrons of the transenna."

Additional improvements were delayed until the Ministry of Education organised for a new building to be built, in 1935.  Andr\u00e9 Godard, a French archaeologist and architect, was the technical director of the Department of Antiquities at the time, and was commissioned to design the new buildings. Other sources however attribute the design to Maxime Siroux.Alterations to Hafez's tomb involved elevating it one metre above ground level and encircling it with five steps.  Eight columns, each ten metres tall, support a copper dome in the shape of a dervish's hat.  The underside of the dome is an arabesque and colourful mosaic.The original, four-columned memorial hall built in 1773 by Karim Khan Zand was extensively expanded.  Sixteen pillars were added to the four original, creating a long verandah, and on several fa\u00e7ades are engraved ghazals and other excerpts from Hafez's poetry."

Roseburg was the site of the 1855 Battle of Hungry Hill, part of the Rogue River Wars of 1855\u201356, fought between several southern Oregon Indian groups and the US Army.The city was named for settler Aaron Rose, who established a homestead within the current city limits on September 23, 1851. Rose was born in 1813 in Ulster County, New York. In 1851, he came to Oregon from Coldwater, Michigan, where he had lived since 1837.\nRose constructed the first building in what would become Roseburg, a rough structure made of poles and clapboards with a front room about 16 or 18 feet square; it was used as a grocery store, backed by a dining room and kitchen. Originally, guests could use the floor of the front room to spread their beds or were able to sleep out of doors under nearby oak trees. His first structure served as a roadside inn and tavern for many years. Rose built a proper hotel in 1853. He died in 1899.\nRoseburg was first known as Deer Creek because it was at the confluence of Deer Creek and the South Umpqua River. In 1854, voters chose Roseburg as the county seat over rival town Winchester. Rose donated 3 acres (1.2 ha) of land and $1,000 for the building of the county courthouse, and the important buildings of Winchester were moved to Roseburg before 1860.Deer Creek post office was established in 1852, and the name changed to \"Roseburgh\" in 1857. The spelling was changed to \"Roseburg\" in 1894. Roseburg was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on October 3, 1872."

Residents said they could predict the weather by watching where the goats were on the mountain; if they were high, the weather would be good. If rain was pending, the goats moved to lower levels. Because the goats wandered across the freeway for grazing, they were a risk to traffic. In the 1980s, they were rounded up and placed for adoption."

However, no permanent buildings and structures were erected, indicating that there were no plans for a permanent air field. The base was used during World War II by several Luftwaffe units including night fighters. After the end of World War II  the air field was abandoned.\nBeginning in 1957 works started to convert the former air force base into an air base to house units of the recently formed German Army's Aviation Corps, utilising the facilities of the previous occupant. These final works were completed in 1962 after which numerous units were stationed at Niederstetten Air Base.\nCurrently, the air base is home of Army Aviation Transport Helicopter Regiment 30 of the German Army. The regiment, which was relocated to Niederstetten in 1980, was part of German Army's Airmobile Operations Division, the division's headquarters being in Veitsh\u00f6chheim. The division was dissolved in 2014, and Army Aviation Transport Helicopter Regiment 30 was subsequently integrated into Rapid Forces Division. Approximately 750 members of the armed forces are at present employed at the air base. However, due to further restructuring within the German Army Aviation Corps this number was increased by 600 in 2011.Army Aviation Transport Helicopter Regiment 30 is equipped with helicopters of the type Bell UH-1D. These helicopters are being replaced by medium-sized NH90s, 32 of which will be stationed at Niederstetten Air Base. To accommodate the new aircraft an extensive building program started in 2007, the first result of which was the completion of a hangar to house 8 helicopters of the type NH90 in February 2008.The air base is also used for civilian purposes, particularly for business flights and recreational purposes. In order to comply with EU regulations and to retain permission for civilian use, the runway was extended by 200 metres in 2011.\n To accommodate the new aircraft an extensive building program started in 2007."

The estate passed to the descendants of his sister Anne (died 1721), who had married Henry Fane of Brympton. Their second son, Thomas Fane, also a Bristol merchant, succeeded his uncle as Member of Parliament for Lyme Regis, beginning the Fane family's long association with the seat. Fane also succeeded a distant cousin and became 8th Earl of Westmoreland in 1762.\nThe Fane family sold the 18th-century house and estate in 1986 to Sir Paul Getty and his wife Victoria Holdsworth. Getty restored the house and estate, adding a library to accommodate his book collection, and a theatre where performances were held for invited guests.\nThe area is known for its population of red kites. Once extinct in England and Scotland, the birds were reintroduced into England beginning in 1989. The area was not originally planned to be the first release site. It was originally intended to be Windsor Great Park, but at the last minute the landowner pulled out and the project nearly collapsed. Getty stepped in and offered Wormsley as an alternative.\nIn 2011, Garsington Opera moved from Garsington Manor near Oxford to a purpose-built pavilion in the grounds of Wormsley."

It is the largest Brazilian state by area and the ninth-largest country subdivision in the world. It is the largest country subdivision in South America, being greater than the areas of Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay combined. Mostly located in the Southern Hemisphere, Amazonas is the third-largest country subdivision in the Southern Hemisphere after the Australian states of Western Australia and Queensland. Located entirely in the Western Hemisphere, it is the fourth-largest country subdivision in the Western Hemisphere after Greenland, Nunavut, and Alaska. If independent, Amazonas could become the sixteenth-largest country in the world, slightly larger than Mongolia. Neighbouring states are (from the north clockwise) Roraima, Par\u00e1, Mato Grosso, Rond\u00f4nia, and Acre. It also borders the nations of Peru, Colombia and Venezuela. This includes the Departments of Amazonas, Vaup\u00e9s and Guain\u00eda in Colombia, as well as the Amazonas state in Venezuela, and the Loreto Region in Peru.\nAmazonas is named after the Amazon River, and was formerly part of the Spanish Empire's Viceroyalty of Peru, a region called Spanish Guyana. It was settled by the Portuguese moving northwest from Brazil in the early 18th century and incorporated into the Portuguese empire after the Treaty of Madrid in 1750. It became a state under the First Brazilian Republic in 1889.\nMost of the state is tropical jungle; cities are clustered along navigable waterways and are accessible only by boat or plane. The capital and largest city is Manaus, a modern city of 2.1 million inhabitants in the middle of the jungle on the Amazon River, 1,500 km upstream from the Atlantic Ocean.  Nearly half the state's population lives in the city; the other large cities, Parintins, Manacapuru, Itacoatiara, Tef\u00e9, and Coari are also along the Amazon River in the eastern half of the state."

It is possible that Whitton was a landing stage on the south bank for the Roman fort and civitas of Petuaria Parisorum at Brough across the river. Roman Coins of Claudius Gothicus (268\u2013270 AD) and Constantine I (the Great) (309\u2013337 AD) have been found in the fields.Pevsner states that the Church tower \"re-uses massive blocks of Roman stone\", but these  blocks of millstone grit which are to be found in several local churches (such as neighbouring Winteringham) may have been transported down the Ouse and the Humber from York where Roman buildings were being dismantled, or may even have come from some sort of triumphal arch or structure (perhaps like the Arch of Constantine), which might have stood at the end of Ermine Street.Whitton is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book as \"Witenai\". Before the Conquest lordship was held by Siward Barn, and after by Saswalo of Ettington, with Henry de Ferrers becoming Tenant-in-chief. Listed are 300 acres (1.2 km2) of meadow, land for eight ploughs, two plough teams belonging to the lord, five men's plough teams, ten villans (villagers) four bordars (smallholders) and ten freemen. The land was valued at seven pounds.\nThe church is not mentioned in the Domesday survey.  St. John the Baptist is a building of stone overlooking the Humber, consisting of a west tower, a small nave (22 feet (6.7 m) wide and 37 feet (11.3 m) long) with a chancel and a south vestry attached.  The partly Romanesque (or Norman) tower contains three, now untolled, bells; the third bell is said to have been brought from the village of Welton, across the river in Yorkshire. The base of the tower forms a porch and the large tower arch, leading into the nave, is thought to be Romanesque.  The font is also ancient and may be from the same period. The church seems to have been almost completely rebuilt in about 1797-8 when the elaborate crocketted pinnacles were removed from the top of the tower. A drawing, by Nattes, of 1794 shows a dilapidated structure with a south aisle and a south porch.\nThe church was reseated in 1865 at the expense of Lady Strickland, and between about 1892 and 1897 the nave, chancel and roof were entirely rebuilt from the designs of W. & C. A. Bassett-Smith, architects, of London. On the north side of the chancel are two stained-glass windows, erected in 1918 to the memory of Henry Spilman who was killed in the First World War.  In 1952\u201353 cracks in the tower were repaired under the direction of A.R Haynes, architect of Brigg.A small part of the relatively new island of Whitton Island in the Humber Estuary falls within the parish."

Le Rocheton has had a number of different purposes. In the 19th century, the estate belonged to the Rochefoucauld family until being purchased in 1816 by Saint-Joseph de Lyon nuns. Their prime mission was to offer education and health care to children. In 1946, the estate was acquired by the YMCA. Because of its close proximity to Paris, the American army and the YMCA had used Le Rocheton as a halfway house during World War II. American soldiers who had been taken captive by the German army stayed at Le Rocheton before returning to America. In the 1950s, the centre began to accommodate asylum seekers from all over the world. It is still owned by the YMCA. Its primary purpose is a hotel for tourists, families and groups. Educational and professional training programmes are also offered."

The area was originally called \"Assanpink,\" after the nearby Assunpink Creek and the Leni Lenape tribe of the same name that lived in the area. Numerous Lenape artifacts have been discovered in Edinburg over the centuries, suggesting that the Lenape may have once had a settlement here. In 1703, two Lenape - Hapohucquona and Tolomhon - sold hundreds of acres directly south of the Assunpink Creek, in the Edinburg area, to one of the area's first colonial landowners: David Lyell. Lyell, in turn, sold much of his tract to the area's first colonial settlers.These early families included the Mounts, Tindalls, Rogers, Hutchinsons, Cubberlys, Grooms, Conovers, Robins, and Hoopers. Around the mid-1800s, they changed the area's name to \"Edinburg,\" reputedly to honor a popular Scottish local.\"Hooper's Tavern\" was a popular local hotel that hosted township meetings in the mid-1700s. In later years, Edinburg featured a schoolhouse, hotels, general stores, a post office, blacksmith, foundry, distillery, cider mill, broom factory, wheelwright, cooper, shoemaker, tanyard, basket factories, and more.In the 1970s and beyond, much of the surrounding farmland was replaced by Mercer County Park, Mercer County Community College, and suburban developments. However, Edinburg still retains some of its original farmland and the broader landscape features a few dozen houses that are 100 years old or older.In October 2019, the Historical Society of West Windsor published an online museum exploring the history of West Windsor- including that of Edinburg.\n\n\n== References =="

He also established a station near what later became the town of Cascade.\nDuring the 1870s, prospectors and miners started searching for gold. The Clara Foltz mines opened on Paddy Flat, and other diggings commenced on Boulder and Gold Fork Creeks. \nIn the late 1870s, the last of the Sheepeater Tribe was removed from Long Valley and Round Valley to a reservation. As the gold sources dwindled, a few of the miners took up squatter's rights. James Horner built a cabin on Clear Creek in 1881, other miners settled on the Payette River.\nAlso in 1888, the first post offices in Valley County were opened at VanWyck, another one opened at Lardo in 1889. That same year Louis McCall and other settlers took squatter's rights on Payette Lake. Their homesteads were the nucleus of what would later become the town of McCall. A freight stop was established at Lardo to service the increased mining activity at Warren Meadows.\nThe 1890 census stated 538 people resided in the VanWyck precinct, and 110 resided in the Alpha precinct. Land survey maps drawn in the 1890s show four schools. The maps also point out sawmills at Warner's Pond and on Gold Fork Creek. A small reservoir near VanWyck can also be seen on them. The 1890s were a period of strife for the new settlers. Ranchers from south of Long Valley annually brought their large herds of cattle to graze in Long Valley. The homesteaders resented the intrusion and retaliated on several occasions by slaughtering the outsiders' cattle.\nGold was first discovered in the Thunder Mountain area in 1893, W.H. Dewey began mining on a large scale in 1902. As many as 3,000 miners swarmed into the region.\nFrom the 1910s onwards, logging became, along with farming and ranching, the economic mainstay of Long Valley. Towns distant from the railroad, such as Alpha, Crawford and Roseberry, soon lost their vitality and died. Towns near the railroad, such as Cascade, Donnelly and McCall, thrived and became the population centers of Valley County.\nThe Stibnite Mining District, located near Yellow Pine, was critical to the country's war effort during World War II."

What the Susquehannock called themselves is unknown, the modern name comes from the name, Sasquesahanough or \"roily water people\", bestowed upon them by Cpt. Smith and his Algonquian interpreter. They made their home by the river and had only one small village (Conestoga), but they were a strong tribe, that controlled trade routes along the river and the upper reaches of the bay. The Susquehannock lived along the river until 1675 when they suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Iroquois. Following this loss they began a period of migration and eventual decline. Five chiefs were murdered in Maryland when they went to a meeting to negotiate a treaty. They migrated to New York in 1677 and intermingled with the Iroquois. They returned to Conestoga in 1697 but left again in the early 18th century when they migrated, again, to Ohio. Some remained behind and became known as Conestogas. They were able to live in Pennsylvania until 1763 when a group of six were slaughtered by the anti-Indian Paxton Boys. The remaining members of the tribe sought protection from the colonial governor and were taken to a workhouse in Lancaster. The Paxton Boys gained entry to the workhouse and murdered fourteen more Indians. Only two Susquehannocks remained in Pennsylvania. They worked the rest of their lives as servants on a farm where they died and were buried bringing about the end of the Susquehannock people in Pennsylvania."

As of 2022, the county had a population of 584,156, making it the third-most populous county in Ireland. Cork County Council is the local authority for the county, while Cork City Council governs the city of Cork and its environs. Notable Corkonians include Michael Collins, Jack Lynch, Roy Keane, Sonia O'Sullivan, Cillian Murphy, and Graham Norton.\nCork borders four other counties: Kerry to the west, Limerick to the north, Tipperary to the north-east and Waterford to the east. The county contains a section of the Golden Vale pastureland that stretches from Kanturk in the north to Allihies in the south. The south-west region, including West Cork, is one of Ireland's main tourist destinations, known for its rugged coast and megalithic monuments and as the starting point for the Wild Atlantic Way. The largest third-level institution is University College Cork, founded in 1845, and has a total student population of around 22,000. Local industry and employers include technology company Dell EMC, the European headquarters of Apple, and the farmer-owned dairy co-operative Dairygold.\nThe county is known as the \"rebel county\", a name given to it by King Henry VII of England for its support, in a futile attempt at a rebellion in 1491, of Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York."

The county shares separate mountainous borders with Tipperary and Kerry. The terrain on the Kerry border was formed between 360 and 374 million years ago, as part of the rising of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks and Caha Mountains mountains ranges. This occurred during the Devonian period when Ireland was part of a larger continental landmass and located south of the equator.

        "content": "The county is colloquially referred to as \"The Rebel County\", although uniquely Cork does not have an official motto. This name has 15th-century origins, but from the 20th century, the name has been more commonly attributed to the prominent role Cork played in the Irish War of Independence (1919\u20131921) when it was the scene of considerable fighting. In addition, it was an anti-Treaty stronghold during the Irish Civil War (1922\u201323). Much of what is now county Cork was once part of the Kingdom of Deas Mumhan (South Munster), anglicised as the \"Desmond\", ruled by the MacCarthy M\u00f3r dynasty. After the Norman invasion in the 12th century, the McCarthy clan were pushed westward into what is now West Cork and County Kerry. Dunlough Castle, standing just north of Mizen Head, is one of the oldest castles in Ireland (AD 1207). The north and east of Cork were taken by the Hiberno-Norman FitzGerald dynasty, who became the Earls of Desmond. Cork City was given an English Royal Charter in 1318 and for many centuries was an outpost for Old English culture. The Fitzgerald Desmond dynasty was destroyed in the Desmond Rebellions of 1569\u20131573 and 1579\u20131583. Much of county Cork was devastated in the fighting, particularly in the Second Desmond Rebellion. In the aftermath, much of Cork was colonised by English settlers in the Plantation of Munster.\nIn 1491 Cork played a part in the English Wars of the Roses when Perkin Warbeck, a pretender to the English throne spread the story that he was really Richard of Shrewsbury (one of the Princes in the Tower), landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow King Henry VII of England. The Cork people supported Warbeck because he was Flemish and not English; Cork was the only county in Ireland to join the fight. The mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England, but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed. Cork's nickname of the 'rebel county' (and Cork city's of the 'rebel city') originates in these events.In 1601 the decisive Battle of Kinsale took place in County Cork, which was to lead to English domination of Ireland for centuries. Kinsale had been the scene of a landing of Spanish troops to help Irish rebels in the Nine Years' War (1594\u20131603). When this force was defeated, the rebel hopes for victory in the war were all but ended. County Cork was officially created by a division of the older County Desmond in 1606.\nIn the early 17th century, the townland of Leamcon (near Schull:\u200a41,\u200a68\u200a) was a pirate stronghold, and pirates traded easily in Baltimore and Whiddy Island.:\u200a54\u201357\u200a\nIn the 19th century, Cork was a centre for the Fenians and for the constitutional nationalism of the Irish Parliamentary Party, from 1910 that of the All-for-Ireland Party. The county was a hotbed of guerrilla activity during the Irish War of Independence (1919\u20131921). Three Cork Brigades of the Irish Republican Army operated in the county and another in the city. Prominent actions included the Kilmichael Ambush in November 1920 and the Crossbarry Ambush in March 1921. The activity of IRA flying columns, such as the one under Tom Barry in west Cork, was popularised in the Ken Loach film The Wind That Shakes The Barley. On 11 December 1920, Cork City centre was gutted by fires started by the Black and Tans in reprisal for IRA attacks. Over 300 buildings were destroyed; many other towns and villages around the county, including Fermoy, suffered a similar fate.During the Irish Civil War (1922\u201323), most of the IRA units in Cork sided against the Anglo-Irish Treaty. From July to August 1922 they held the city and county as part of the so-called Munster Republic. However, Cork was taken by troops of the Irish Free State in August 1922 in the Irish Free State offensive, which included both overland and seaborne attacks. For the remainder of the war, the county saw sporadic guerrilla fighting until the Anti-Treaty side called a ceasefire and dumped their arms in May 1923. Michael Collins, a key figure in the War of Independence, was born near Clonakilty and assassinated during the civil war in B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th, both in west Cork."

On Wulfseck Mountain they built their castle, which they named Wulfeshagen, later Altena. This is one of the several legends of the establishment of the county of Altena and the building of the castle.\nAfter the acquisition of the parish land of Mark near the city of Hamm in 1198, the counts of Altena took Mark Castle as their primary residence and called themselves the Counts of the Mark. They continued to only occasionally inhabit Altena Castle and from 1392 onward it was only used as a residence for the county bailiff (Amtmann). Count Engelbert III of the Mark gave the small settlement at the base of the mountain the rights of liberty (such as self-governance). In 1455 the castle burned down and was only re-erected partially.\nIn Brandenburg-Prussian times the castle became a garrison and was sold to the town of Altena in 1771. In the following years an almshouse and a workhouse was established there. This existed until 1840. From 1766 to 1811 there existed a criminal court and prison in the castle. By 1834 the castle was greatly deteriorated and was to be reconstructed. Due to lack of funds, however, this was not carried out. The Johanniter Orde set up a hospital in the buildings.Due to the 300th anniversary of the membership of the County of Mark to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1909 plans for a reconstruction of the castle began. In 1914 this was completed, apart from the outer bailey and lower gatehouse. There was a controversial debate about the modes of reconstruction, where the preference of historic designs over the medieval and early modern architecture was criticised. In 1918 the last works were completed.\nIn 1914, Richard Schirrmann established the world's first youth hostel within the castle, which is still in use today (Jugendherberge Burg Altena). The original rooms are a museum today. The youth hostel continues to run at a location on the lower castle court yard, opened in 1934.Today the castle is symbol  of the town of Altena and a tourist attraction. The entry ticket is also valid for the nearby Deutsche Drahtmuseum (German Wire Museum). During the first weekend of August a yearly Medieval Festival takes place in the castle and town. Part of the castle is used as a restaurant."

More substantial buildings may have followed in the 15th and 16th centuries with corn and flour mills.\nThe town entered a major period of growth during the Industrial Revolution, as new mills were constructed to process cotton. The climate and weather were conducive to the industry, as was the town's nearby location to the rapidly developing industrial and mercantile centre at Manchester, dubbed 'Cottonopolis'. Only a few of these mills survive today, and none are operational anymore. During this period, the brothers Thomas, David and Peter Whitehead became important entrepreneurs in the town. They built a number of mills, including one of the earliest mills in the valley, at Lower Mill, and the still existing Ilex Mill. They also built substantial houses for themselves at Holly Mount, as well as large numbers of terraced houses for their workers. Other industries active in this period included quarrying and small scale coal mining, as well as an expanding commercial sector.\nAs with many mid-Lancashire towns, it saw a population decline in the 20th century, going from 30,000 inhabitants in the 1911 census to 21,500 in the 1971 census. With the decline of the traditional manufacturing industries, shoemaking became one of the last survivors. this was usually known locally as the slipper industry, since slipper-making grew from the local processing of felt, which itself grew from the textile industry. The firm of H. W. Tricketts, in nearby Waterfoot, had been a major producer and exporter of footwear across the British Empire, but shoemaking declined rapidly from the 1980s. Firms closed as production moved overseas, and the remaining companies are largely importers.The church of St Nicholas (Church of England) is at Newchurch (rebuilt 1825) as is the Roman Catholic church of St Peter (1892). Other churches are St Michael's Lumb, St James's Waterfoot, St Anne's Edgeside, St John's Cloughfold, St Mary's Oakenhead, St John the Evangelist's Crawshawbooth, St Mary and All Saints Goodshaw (rebuilt 1790). Another RC church (dedicated to St James the Less) is at Oakenhead and there are a number of Nonconformist chapels."

It consists of the former house of the mill owner George Hardman, built in the 1840s, and originally standing in 28 acres of parkland. It is still set in extensive landscaped grounds. Donated to the township of Rawtenstall in 1902 by Richard Whitaker, who brought the house from Hardman for the purposes of civic recreation, the property is now known as The Whitaker, previously Rossendale Museum and Art Gallery. The gardens and surrounding land are laid out as a public park. The park itself has tennis courts, a bowling green, basketball court, an Incredible Edible area, a skateboard area and a playground as well as formal gardens and fountains.\nThe recently refurbished museum contains exhibits of local history, gallery spaces, and a cabinet of curiosities room. There is an extensive exhibition of taxidermy, and gallery areas for displaying contemporary art and other exhinbitions. Arthur Mee considered it 'one of the best small museums in the North', saying \"...perhaps the most fascinating things in the museum are the Domestic Bygones, with hourglasses, toys and spinning wheels, snuff boxes and tinder boxes, the sand dredgers used before blotting-paper was known, rushlights and moulds for making candles, a grand collection of the homely things our forefathers (sic) used\". In 2019 The Whitaker was awarded a National Lottery Heritage Fund award of \u00a31.7 million to convert the museum and the former barn and stables. This has doubled its size and enabled the museum to develop its displays and education work, its cafe/restaurant and bar, as well as the study spaces and a shop. It reopened at the end of July 2021, and now includes the old Rossendale Council Parks Department yard at the rear which has been converted to a multi-purpose public area."

An Arctic island, it forms part of the S\u00f8raust-Svalbard Nature Reserve, home to polar bears and reindeer. An ice field covers its eastern side.

        "content": "The history of Edge\u00f8ya's discovery has been a matter of dispute. Thomas Edge, writing in 1622, claimed the island was discovered by one of his ships in 1616. However, Joris Carolus, in a map published in 1614 and allegedly based on discoveries made by him the same year, shows what appears to be Edge\u00f8ya's south coast. Carolus showed the coastline split into two parts: \"Onbekende Cust\" (meaning \"Unknown Coast\" in Dutch) in the west, and \"Morfyn\" in the east. Islands are shown offshore of Morfyn. Martin Conway argued in 1901 that Carolus' chart indicated he discovered Edge\u00f8ya, but, as Wielder points out, Conway was ignorant of a map (engraved in 1612) by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius, which illustrated a coastline to the east of Spitsbergen. The coastline, indented, with islands offshore, was labelled \"Gerrits Eylant\". Wielder believed this to be the first record of Edge\u00f8ya's south coast.\nSchilder, an expert on Dutch cartography, said Carolus merely copied both coastlines from earlier charts, while he believed that Plancius had copied some names from a chart by Mouris Willemsz, unknown to Wielder, that was published in 1608 or earlier by Cornelis Claeszoon (British Library, London). Willemsz's chart, which Schilder says shows Edge\u00f8ya labeled as \"Groen Landt\", does not show Edge\u00f8ya at all, but only shows a single coastline (not two) that is supposed to represent Spitsbergen. In fact, what appears to be Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya is shown to the southeast of Spitsbergen. Plancius had thus only created a duplicate Spitsbergen. Carolus, as well, made a duplicate Spitsbergen, as his Morfyn has an uncanny resemblance to Willemsz's Groen Landt. This would indicate that the island would not have been discovered until 1616, as claimed by Edge. A 1617 letter written between the English whalers proves that Europeans had discovered the island at least at that late of date, or earlier, as Edge claims.\nFour Russian sailors were marooned on Edge\u00f8ya, or a small island off the coast of Edge\u00f8ya, from 1743 until September 1749. Three survived to tell an epic tale of survival. Author David Roberts wrote a book about his research on this story, Four Against The Arctic. He concluded, although not definitively, that the men were probably on a small island to the southeast of Edge\u00f8ya called Halvm\u00e5ne\u00f8ya, or Half Moon Island.\nWhile no major settlement grew upon Edge\u00f8ya, whaling and walrus hunting were extensive industries in the area. Remains of these can be found offshore of Edge\u00f8ya, on B\u00f6lsche\u00f8ya in the Thousand Islands group."

To the north, the sound known as Freemansundet lies between Edge\u00f8ya and Barents\u00f8ya. In the northeast, Olgastretet separates Edge\u00f8ya from Kong Karls Land. Minor island groups lay to the east (Ryke Yse\u00f8yane) and to the south (Thousand Islands). The island's south coast in indented by its largest fjord, Tjuvfjorden. The island's northernmost point is Kapp Heuglin, a cape named in August 1870 for the German explorer Theodor von Heuglin (1824\u201376), during the Heuglin-Zeil expedition.\nGeologically, the island resembles central Spitsbergen, with Mesozoic rocks (specifically, Triassic shales with subordinate sandstones, with occasional diabase intrusions, and, in the southwest, strata from the Jurassic), the effects of glacial erosion, and appearance of polar ice caps. On the eastern side of the island is the large glacier of Edge\u00f8yj\u00f8kulen.\nAlong with Barents\u00f8ya and some of the neighbouring islands, Edge\u00f8ya forms part of South East Svalbard Nature Reserve, established by the Norwegian government in 1973.

        "content": "The area of San Miguel and the rest of the southern Salinas Valley was inhabited by the Salinans, an Indigenous Californian nation.\nThe Spanish founded the settlement at San Miguel on 25 July 1797, when Ferm\u00edn de Lasu\u00e9n established Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel, under the authority of the Franciscan Order. The site of the mission was specifically chosen due to its proximity to the large number of Salinan villages in the area. The interior of the mission church features murals executed under the direction of the famed artist Esteban Munr\u00e1s in the 1820s.\nThe mission's location between Mission San Luis Obispo and Mission San Antonio de Padua provided a stop on the trip that had previously taken two days. In 1803, the mission reported an Indian population of 908, while its lands grazed 809 cattle, 3,223 sheep, 342 horses and 29 mules. That year's harvest included about 2,186 fanegas of wheat and corn (A fanega was about 220 pounds or 100 kilograms). Most of the mission burned, while still being developed, in 1806. It was rebuilt within a year.\n\nThe Rios-Caledonia Adobe was built in 1835 just south of Mission San Miguel as a home for the overseer of mission lands.On July 15, 1836, following the Mexican secularization of the missions, Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel was acquired by Ygnacio Coronel, a noted Californio ranchero and politician.\nIn 1846, Governor P\u00edo Pico sold Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel for $600 to Petronilo R\u00edos and William Reed. Reed used the Mission as a family residence and a store. In 1848, Reed and his family were murdered, leaving the Mission vacant for a period of time. The Mission was a stopping place for miners coming from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and, consequently, was used as a saloon, dance hall, storeroom and living quarters.\nIn 1859, President James Buchanan returned the mission to the Catholic Church. In 1878, after 38 years without a resident priest, Padre Philip Farrelly became the first pastor of Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel since the secularization. In 1928, Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel and Mission San Antonio de Padua were both returned to the Franciscan Order, which led to their restorations and repairs.\nThe 2003 San Simeon earthquake caused severe damage to the sanctuary at Mission San Miguel. The Catholic Church considered closing the parish due to the extensive damage and the estimated $15 million cost of repair; however, the work has since been completed and the mission has since reopened.\nIn 2011, San Miguel's local business community formed the San Miguel Chamber of Commerce in order to promote the village's tourism and agricultural industries."

        "content": "In the Domesday Book the settlement is referred to as Collingtrev or Colentreu, Colen being Celtic for place and trev possibly meaning 'tree' or trough. Others think that Colen is a version of St Columba to whom the village church was dedicated in 1170. In the 15th century the village is referred to as Colyngtrowgh and in the 17th century as Collingtrough. The trough is certainly the basis for the name of the main road, Watering Lane, from the A45 up to the crossroads at the centre of the village. Cattle and steam engines collected water from the spring here. In 2006 its site was revealed when undergrowth was cleared back from the side of the road and the Parish Council decided to make a feature of it. A more likely explanation for the name is in a 2008 document from the borough council dealing with conservation. This mentions that: \"Collingtree probably had Saxon origins\" and that its name is thought to be derived from \"Cola's tree\", after an Anglo-Saxon leader's name and a notable tree, possibly a boundary tree.\nThe centre of Collingtree was designated a Conservation Area in 1978. In 2008, the borough council asked for comments on a draft Re-appraisal and Management Plan for the Conservation Area. The proposed changes to the area are to expand the work to preserve the history and character of the village. The historic 17th- to 19th-century buildings, the 10 listed buildings, the layout of boundary walls and the use of local stone, combine to create a distinctive location with a strong sense of place, worthy of protection and enhancement. The Management Plan outlines how to protect the historic character and actively manage the area, including preserving the existing character through to the control of advertisements and the monitoring of change.\nThe village has one of the most unusual High Streets in the country. It runs roughly north to south, has a pub, The Wooden Walls of Old England, but no shops and leads nowhere in either direction. The village grew on a route between Blisworth in the south and Wootton in the north. The southbound route was cut off in the 1950s by the building of the M1 motorway. The northern part was cut off when Collingtree Grange was built and is now cut off by the golf course. The oldest houses are 17th-century, of which four are listed, all in the High Street. No.43 is Grade II* listed. Another five listed buildings, in the High Street and Barn Corner are 18th-century. The form of the village is largely unchanged since about 1800 or earlier.An application by the company Bovis to build 1,000 houses close to the village in East Hunsbury was proposed in 2014. It was rejected by the Northampton Borough Council as it would affect the setting of the village and the Conservation Area. When the area was designated in 1978 it was intended to ensure that any changes which take place harmonise with the existing area.... At the time of writing, the application has been called in by the Secretary of State. Collingtree and East Hunsbury are supporting the borough council and defending its position. An application to build a large complex of warehouses and a rail freight terminal on the south site of the M1 adjacent to Collingtree was strongly opposed and finally withdrawn after strong opposition from Collingtree and other local parishes."

The property was acquired by George W. Bush in 1999 and was known as the Western White House during his presidency. Bush spent vacation time at the house, where he also entertained visiting dignitaries from around the world. The ranch received its name from the Prairie Chapel School which was built nearby on land donated by mid-19th century German immigrant Heinrich Engelbrecht from Oppenwehe, Germany, who owned the land that now comprises the Bush ranch. Engelbrecht also donated land for the nearby Canaan Baptist Church (the \"Prairie Chapel\")."

The original Engelbrecht ranch house is about 4,400 feet (1,300 m) from the main house on Rainey Road and is now called the \"Governor's House\" and is used to accommodate overflow guests. The Bushes stayed in the house during construction of the new house.\nIn 1999, a year before he became president, shortly after earning a $14.3 million profit from the sale of the Texas Rangers, then-Texas Governor Bush bought the land for an estimated $1.3 million from the Engelbrecht family. Assisting Bush in arrangements for the purchase was the then Texas Secretary of State Elton Bomer.Bush removed five large hog barns on Mill Road leading into the compound in order to construct a new house, guest house, and garage.On May 10, 2008, the ranch played host to the wedding of Jenna Bush to Henry Hager, a son of former Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, John H. Hager. The ceremony was relatively simple and was attended by some two hundred friends and family members."

In the less formal setting, dress code for meetings called for an open collar and no tie. Guests were typically treated to meals of Southwestern cuisine. When not holding meetings or briefings, Bush spent his time mountain biking, jogging, fishing, bird hunting, and clearing brush.\nIn 2001\u20132002, Bush held meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abudallah in his 2001 Ford F-250 pickup truck at the ranch. The meetings were covered by the media as \"pickup diplomacy\" as part as a personal approach to foreign policy.  For security concerns, Presidents cannot drive on public roads, but Bush could drive himself, dignitaries, legislators, press and others around the ranch in his truck. In 2013, President Bush donated his personal 2013 Ford F-150 King Ranch edition to be auctioned for charity.Bush made clear his preference for spending some time away from his official residence at the White House in Washington, DC. In 2001, he said, \"I think it is so important for a president to spend some time away from Washington, in the heartland of America.\""

He began construction of the mansion which was probably completed by his son Ezekiel. The property later had a succession of owners, including the Methuen family in the late 18th century and the Walmesley family from 1870 to 1918. John Walmesley (c.1775\u20131873) of Preston, Lancashire married Ellen, daughter of Richard Godolphin Long of Rood Ashton House, Wiltshire; their son Richard (1816\u20131893), lawyer and JP, is described as \"of Lucknam\".The two-storey Wallis house forms the three-bay centre of the present building. In 1827 it was bought by Andreas Boode (1763\u20131844), a Dutch-British owner of plantations in Demerara which used enslaved labour. He had the house re-fronted in ashlar, with a ground-floor loggia having four pairs of Doric columns, and greatly enlarged it by adding two-storey wings on both sides: each has three bays and is terminated by a two-storey bowed pavilion. The resulting facade is described by Orbach as \"impressively long\".The whole was remodelled in 1919\u201320 for Sir Alfred Read, chairman of Coast Lines, the UK's largest coastal shipping company. The central part was given a three-gabled attic and tall chimneys in Jacobean style, and the rear front and interiors were remodelled. Pevsner called the Jacobean work an \"excresence\", but in Orbach's 2021 updating it is merely \"spurious\".To one side a tall square late-19th-century water tower rises higher than the house. Formerly turreted, its flat parapet and corner urns result from changes designed in 1937 by Oswald Brakspear.The house was designated as Grade II listed in 1960."

The park is popular with both tourists and area residents, with some comparing it to New York City's Central Park. Apart from activities such as walking, biking or volleyball, the park serves as a center for community gatherings, such as the annual Furry Scurry. Wedding receptions are often held in the historic boathouse pavilion. In 2012 the American Planning Association designated the park one of its \u201cGreat Public Spaces in America\u201d."

The eastern Washington Park neighborhood has borders defined by the city of Denver as Downing Street, Cherry Creek, I-25, and University Boulevard. The public park is bounded along its long western edge by Washington Park West, and along all its other edges by eastern Washington Park. The park has two lakes, ten tennis courts, a large meadow used for lawn sports such as volleyball and soccer, a lawn bowling green, two of the city's largest flower gardens, and its busiest recreation center."

        "content": "Washington Park was initially designed by the German landscape architect Reinhard Schuetze between 1899 and 1908. His design remains fairly intact and included Smith and Grasmere lakes and the Lily Pond, all fed with a city ditch that Schuetze had edged with Russian olives and other trees. Other pieces of his design remain intact and include the large meadow edged with a grove of trees to the south of Smith Lake and the carriage ways that meander through the park. Later landscape architects, such as Saco Rienk DeBoer and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. added their own contributions to the park including a boating pavilion and an evergreen grove on the north side of the park.\nWashington Park as a neighborhood started development soon after the founding of Denver though it was still fairly rural in nature. By 1886, there was enough population to create Denver's first suburb, South Denver, which by the silver bust of the 1890s was annexed into Denver due to financial difficulties. Development hastened with the creation of the park in 1899. Most of the houses were built of brick between 1900 and 1940.The park was designed in French country style with new paths and plantings introduced by city planner George Kessler in 1908. DeBoer architects were responsible for completing the big Perennial Garden at Downing in 1918 and Mt. Vernon Gardens in 1926. The Olmsted Brothers designed rolling Evergreen Hill, enhanced the pedestrian paths, and built the Lily Pond in 1912. The boating pavilion, which was built in 1913, was designed by Jacques Benedict in 1913 following the Italian style of architecture. The bathing beach was installed on Smith Lake in 1911 and the pedestrian and car bridges over City Ditch were installed by architect F.W. Ameter in 1912. The Field House, the residence of poet and journalist Eugene Field, was moved to the park's northeast edge by Titanic survivor and philanthropist Molly Brown in 1930. The modern Recreation center was designed in 1971 by the architectural firm Anderson Barker Rinker.\nEugene Field, a reporter for the Denver Tribune between 1881 and 1883, lived in a small cottage at 315 West Colfax Avenue. Field is best remembered, though, for his children's poems. Years after Field left Denver and the house had been condemned, Molly Brown bought the house and donated it to the city. It was designated a landmark, moved to the east side of Washington Park, at Franklin St. and Exposition Ave., and restored. It served as the Eugene Field Branch of the Denver Public Library for many years. Field is further memorialized by the statue by Mabel Landrum Torrey, illustrating one of his most famous poems, \"Wynken, Blynken and Nod\". In the 1970s the house became the headquarters of the Park People and the library moved to a new building at University Blvd. and Exposition Ave.\nSince the late 1990s, Washington Park has become a very popular urban neighborhood because of its central location, its proximity to the park, and its access to several commercial business enclaves. This has led to a transformation of the neighborhood, which worries some residents because of an increased density, more traffic, and the propensity of some developers to \"pop the top\" or altogether \"scrape\" historic homes."

A recreation center with an indoor pool, free weights, and other athletic facilities is also located in the park. Smith Lake has a boathouse that can be rented out for various events.\nThe park connects to the city via a number of bike trails at Exposition Avenue, Marion St. and Louisiana Avenue. The system of asphalt and gravel paths facilitates diverse uses: bicyclists, pedestrians, roller bladers, skateboarders, strollers, pet walkers, rented surreys, etc. The grove trees planted at intervals allow views of the Front Range mountains west of the park. The park is also known for its flower garden, the largest in Denver. Built in 1917, it was a Victorian-style Perennial Garden that included an elliptical lawn and symmetrical flowerbeds with 15,000 flower varieties.The flower garden also includes 54 flower beds in an informal arrangement. One garden is an exact replica of Martha Washington's garden at Mt. Vernon.Some of the artefacts in the park include the sculptor Mabel Torrey's \"Wynken, Blynken and Nod\", which honors poet Eugene Field (1919); and George Carlson's bronze \"Early Day Miner,\" that depicts local history (1980).The Washington Park neighborhood is one of the oldest in Denver and includes many early twentieth century brick houses and even some late nineteenth century brick houses in West Washington Park. There are several commercial enclaves in the neighborhood such as South Gaylord Street and Alameda Avenue, as well as several smaller corner store areas located at stops of the former streetcars that ran down the residential streets. The South Pearl Street area, in the neighboring Platt Park neighborhood, is frequently misidentified as being part of the Washington Park neighborhood.\nThe neighborhood borders I-25, which was expanded in 2006 and includes the RTD light rail. The Louisiana/Pearl station and University of Denver stations connect the southern part of the Washington Park neighborhood with the light rail network, and the Broadway station serves West Washington Park. The south end of the park itself borders South High School."

A $1.5 million budget was prepared for the renovation of the park's south entrance, picnic site at Mt. Vernon gardens, and the City Ditch.The goals for the treatment of the park included the preservation of historic site patterns, site features, structures, site remnants, and vegetation. Other works included the restoration of the definitive edges of the park spaces and the re-establishment of tree groves, paths, and topography defining the open spaces. Preservation of the perimeter road as a significant landscape characteristic, modified to reflect bicycle and pedestrian use of the road, was also one of the recommendations. Landscape features such as meadow areas in the park were to be restored with native grasses and wildflowers to reduce water consumption. The lakeshore restoration was intended to focus on historic lake design and rehabilitation of City Ditch to convey historic flows. Other goals included the reuse of irrigation water through the city ditch system and water-saving measures for swimming pools, showers, and faucets.  Most of the conservation practices address the conflicts between pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists, park plant diversity, and water quality issues."

        "content": "The 16th-century Dutch Revolt against the Habsburgs created a new country with a new religion. Soon, the need for a seat of higher learning was felt and in 1575 Leiden University was founded with the spoils from a confiscated Catholic monastery nearby.\nAt the time the university was founded, it was immediately determined that a library in the vicinity of lecture halls was an absolute necessity. The library's first book was the Polyglot Bible, printed by Christoffel Plantijn, a gift of William of Orange to the library in 1575.  The presentation of this book is regarded as the base on which the library is built (fundamentum locans futurae aliquando bibliothecae). The library became operational in the vault of the current Academy building at Rapenburg on 31 October 1587.\n\nIn 1595 the Nomenclator appeared, the first catalogue of Leiden University Libraries as well as the first printed catalogue of an institutional library in the world.  The publication of the catalogue coincided with the opening of the new library on the upper floor of the Faliede Bagijnkerk (now Rapenburg 70) next to the Theatrum Anatomicum.In 1864 the copy for the complete alphabetical catalogue of the library in Leiden from 1575 to 1860 was finished; it was never to appear in print.  Readers were able to consult alphabetical and systematic registers of the Leiden library in the form of bound catalogue cards, known as Leidse boekjes.  This remained the cataloguing system for the library until 1988.\nThe 22nd Librarian of Leiden University, Johan Remmes de Groot took the initiative for the Dutch library automation endeavor PICA (Project Integrated Catalogue Automation).  Pica was started up in 1969 and was bought by OCLC in 2000.  The first automation project in Leiden started in 1976, produced 400,000 titles via the Dutch PICA-GGC and resulted within a few years in a catalog on microfiche, which partly replaced the famous Leiden booklets catalogue.\nIn 1983 the library moved to its present location on Witte Singel in a new building by architect Bart van Kasteel.  The first online catalogue became available in 1988.\nAccording to Nicholas A. Basbanes, Leiden University Libraries represent \"an essential benchmark [...] not only for the teeming collection of extraordinary materials it has scrupulously gathered and maintained over a sustained period of time, but most of all for being the world's first scholarly library in a truly modern sense.  The litany of 'firsts' recorded at Leiden is dazzling \u2013 the first printed catalogue to be prepared by an institution of its holdings, the first attempt to identify and maintain what today are known as 'special collections,' the first systematic attempt to develop a corps of influential friends, patrons, and benefactors throughout the world, the first 'universal' library, the list goes on and on \u2013 and underpinning it all is a humanistic approach to education and discovery that has figured prominently throughout its history, along with an unbending belief in the limitless potential of human inquiry.\""

        "content": "Leiden University Libraries focuses on the complete information chain. The library facilitates not only access to (published) information but increasingly supports the evaluation, use, production and dissemination of scholarly information. To accomplish this the library's activities range from supporting education in information literacy to serving as an expert center for digital publishing. The library aims to function as the scholarly information manager of Leiden University. The strategic plan Partner in Kennis (Partner in Knowledge) focuses on the transformation of the library to an expert centre supporting research and education in digital spaces through Virtual Research Environments and Datalabs, the realization of library learning centres, the development of new expert areas such as data curation and text & data mining, and on digital information skills.\nLeiden's Catalogue makes available a considerable array of digital scholarly information: more than 400 databases, >70,000 e-journals, >5,000 newspapers and newsmagazines, >1,000,000 e-books and reference works, many hundreds of millions of journal articles, its digital special collections and repository materials. These digital information resources are available worldwide to Leiden University students and staff. \nThe special collections and archives of Leiden University (see below) are increasingly made available through the library's Catalogue and Digital Collections environment.\n\nThe library supports researchers from Leiden University through its Centre for Digital Scholarship which focuses on open access, copyright, data management, text and data mining and virtual research environments.The library makes all doctoral dissertations available online through the Catalogue and Leiden University Scholarly Publications that functions according to the open access principles. Furthermore, publications from Leiden researchers are increasingly made available through the same repository. Thanks to the use of international standards, among others the Open Archives Initiative, the repository is visited daily by general and specialized search engines that harvest and index this information.\nIn 2007, the library started with an ambitious program to renew and renovate its facilities: wireless access became available throughout the library in December 2007, in March 2008 the completely renovated Special Collections Reading Room Dousa was reopened, in June 2008 the fire protection systems installed in the closed stacks and the vaults of the library were taken into use, in December 2008 library patrons were able to make use of the new facilities created in the renovated Information Centre Huygens, and a new exhibition space was opened on 25 March 2010, in the direct vicinity of a completely renovated entrance. In 2012\u20132013 the study areas (the complete first floor and parts of the second floor) of the University Library were renovated and a media centre was opened.\nSince 1 June 2009, the Leiden libraries form one organization: Leiden University Libraries (UBL). Leiden University Libraries has a number of locations: the University Library, the libraries of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Law, Mathematics and Natural Sciences and the East Asian Library. The collections of the former Archeology, Art History and Kern libraries are available at the University Library. On 3 September 2012, a Library Learning Centre was opened on the university's The Hague campus.\n\nLeiden University Libraries took over in 2013 the colonial collections including the entire map collections (colonial and modern) of the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) and in 2014 the complete collection of the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (KITLV). By bringing these collections together with those of the university libraries, the largest Indonesian and Caribbean collections worldwide were created. Furthermore, Leiden University Libraries took over the KITLV-Jakarta office where extensive paper and digital collections on modern Indonesia are collected and cataloged. To house its world-famous and vast Asian collections a number of new facilities have been created: an open stack area making 5 km of materials directly available and a new remote storage facility housing 38 km of library materials. On 14 September 2017, H.M. Queen M\u00e1xima opened The Asian Library, a new floor on top of the University Library.\nIn 2017, the Academic Historical Museum became part of UBL. The library of The Netherlands Institute for the Near East, specialised in the fields of Assyriology, Egyptology and  Near Eastern Archaeology, became part of UBL in 2018.Leiden University Libraries works together with other organizations nationally and internationally on innovation projects in this area. The library e.g. participated in the DAREnet  project and in projects financed by the European Union such as DRIVER-II,OAPEN, PAGODE and ARMA."

It was named for Charles Bammel, a German Houstonian who built the Bammel and Kuehnle Merchandise store with his partner in 1915 and moved to the community for health reasons. A Bammel post office, for which Herman Kuehnle was the first postmaster, operated from 1916 until 1929. Bammel's store burned in 1927 but was later rebuilt to serve the new Bammel Forest subdivision. The town's population was reported as roughly fifty from 1929 until oil was discovered in the area in 1938. In 1943, the community reported two stores and a population of 200, but in 1949 its population was estimated at twenty. During the 1980s Bammel's residents were mainly commuters who worked in Houston. The community included two shopping centers, several schools, a hospital, and nearby cemeteries."

A total of 68 medals (23 gold, 23 silver, 22 bronze) were awarded. In many countries, due in part to the conflation of the Olympic Games and the World's Fair in Paris, the media discussed only the athletics events under the \"Olympic\" name while ignoring the incredible variety of other sports featured at the time.The 23 events listed are those currently considered to have been of Olympic stature by the International Olympic Committee and most Olympic historians.  They exclude all events that used a handicap system, as well as all events which were open to professional athletes. The IOC has never decided which events were \"Olympic\" and which were not.Competitions were held on 14 July, 15 July, 16 July, 19 July, and 22 July.  This included Bastille Day, which is a French holiday, and then Sunday, which many of the American athletes protested.  Even with many Americans not competing in finals because of confusion caused by the organizers' decision to count scores achieved on Monday, 16 July for finals held on Sunday, 15 July and subsequent rescission of that decision, the United States won more than 4 times as many medals as any other nation, including 16 of the 23 gold medals.\nThe conditions of competition were also subpar compared even to those at the previous games in 1896.  There was no track for the Paris Games, as a grass field dotted with trees and of unequal elevation was used.  The course was 500 metres in length, an unusual distance for a track."

        "content": "The \"maze\" consists of two rectangular boxes\u2014one large and containing the other; centered. If one traces the patterns with different colored markers, one would find that between the boxes are two contiguous geometric patterns that resemble a maze. One \"maze\" is contained by the other on the left hand side.\nThe swastika that appears in the lower left hand corner is not part of the original work. A 1930s-era photo featured in the Hemet Centennial calendar shows the stone without this. (Featured photo of July 2010; available from the Hemet Museum).The stone and its surrounding land were designated as a California state landmark in 1956. Sometime later a vandal added a counter-clockwise swastika to one corner of the carving. This is not the same swastika that the Nazis in Germany appropriated after WWI; the Nazis used the clockwise version of the swastika.\nSwastikas were used in Oriental and Native American art long before the Nazis used it as a symbol. The stone is now protected by a pair of chain-link fences.\nThe maze petroglyph, depending upon interpretation, could show four walled structures or areas, consisting of two simple objects and two \u201cmaze-like\u201d complex objects. There is an inner and outer object for each type of simple or complex object.\nTo reference the diagram called \u201cConceptual Approximation of the Maze Stone near Hemet, California,\u201d the \"simple\" objects are denoted by the square/rectangular black (outer) and gray/beige (inner) lines. The gray/beige area is filled in and appears as a rectangular object.  What the computer considers a gray color, other people say is the color beige. The \"complex\" objects are blue (outer) and purple (inner). The purplish complex object appears to be completely surrounded by the blueish complex object. The inner objects are completely surrounded in the space created by the outer objects. The blueish object seems to surround the simple gray object in the center, but is unable to completely do so. The gray/beige object is either directly attached and is completely surrounded by the space associated with the outer black boundary wall that surrounds the whole \u201cmaze.\u201d\nTaking away or adding the blue and purple areas makes no difference to the relationship between the inner gray/beige object and the outer black boundary line, as the space between them is still connected. The space inside the black line was left white/blank. The diagram was created from multiple pictures, and visual guesswork was used with a computer graphics program to draw straight, colorized lines without measurements.\nThe petroglyph appears to be a square, although the attempt to redo the diagram by computer produced better results when slightly elongated as a rectangle. Also the original is on the slightly curved surface of a stone. Whether the maze can be recreated in a square while attempting to keep all the lines \"uniformly separated\" on a flat surface arose as an issue for the creator of the conceptual approximation diagram. Since there are ten lines to be crossed on the top, bottom, left and right of the original petroglyph, the idealized version of the \u201cmaze\u201d could fit into a square.\nThe original design constraints and reasoning behind the prehistoric design remain unclear. At any given spot in the blueish space, there are up to three possible directions to follow, not the four directions possible when 90-degree line segments join. The outside edge of the outer complex object shows the outline of the inner complex object three times. There are three \u201cdead ends\u201d (in maze terminology) to the blueish-object's area. If one looks at the spot where two of the blueish ends meet before reaching the inner complex object on the left side, one would have to transverse six straight segments to reach that point \u2013 from either end point.\nThe analysis discussion can be changed by switching the \"walls\" to pathways and the pathways to be impassable areas, but the \u201cmaze\u201d has design features that have nothing to do with a conventional \u201cmaze\u201d. That is, where the objective is to go from a starting point to an ending point through a confusing set of passageways. The Maze Stone is not what European Americans might consider to be a regular maze. Without knowing the original intent of the creator, it is difficult to know if the maze represents an engineering drawing, a symbol, an artistic concept, or something else.\nThis petroglyph is classified as California Engraved, within the California Tradition of rock art."

Although several union demands were contentious issues, the two main demands of the UAW Local 200 were \"union shop and checkoff,\" which became a rallying cry for the strikers. Negotiations for a new contract had spanned 18 months and officially ended with the exodus of Ford workers at 10 a.m. on the morning of September 12. The strike included picketing and eventually led to a two-day blockade of vehicles surrounding the Ford plant on November 5.The strike ended on December 19 as both sides agreed to a temporary agreement proposal, while arbitration regarding the implementation of a fully unionized shop and medical coverage continued under Justice Ivan C. Rand. His report was released on January 29, 1946. The Rand Formula, as it became known, was one result of his report. This gave the UAW formal recognition as the sole negotiators representing all employees of Ford Motor Company. This changed both collective bargaining and labour relations by legitimizing unions."

        "content": "In August 1941 an agreement between the American UAW and Ford Motor Company had given American Ford workers union shop and checkoff. Ford did not extend these same provisions to their Canadian workers, this resulted in \"bad faith\" between the company and the Canadian UAW. Following the ratification of a company-recognized UAW Canadian union on January 15, 1942, periodic work stoppages took place. In response to company continuance of making decisions as it had prior to the formalizing of the union, walkouts took place in November 1942, April 1943 and April-May 1944, these were all precursors of the Ford Strike of 1945.Throughout 1945 negotiations for a new company-union agreement were conducted. On January 22, 1945, the Ontario minister of Labour Charles Daley, upon request from the Ontario Labour relations Board, appointed Louis Fine as conciliation officer in an attempt to reach an agreement in the contentious negotiations. On March 28 Fine reported back stating: \"...in his opinion an agreement was impossible and the situation was very complicated and difficult.\" On August 31 Ford notified the union that 800 workers were to be laid off, on September 4 tensions were further exacerbated when an additional 1656 layoffs were projected to occur by September 14. Essentially these layoff announcements ended any hopes for a non-strike agreement to be reached. On the morning of September 12, 1945, at 10 a.m., after 18 months of failed negotiations, UAW workers took part in a wildcat strike leaving their work at the Ford plant in Windsor, Ontario.At a September 12 meeting at the Market Hall Windsor Mayor Art Reaume declared his support for the striking auto workers stating: \"Every member of my city council stands prepared to see that no man or woman is starved in this land of plenty. Heads have been smashed in other places by imported police, but let me pledge to you that it will not happen here.\"During the Ford Strike of 1945, a huge barricade of workers' cars and trucks were assembled on November 4, 1945, along Drouillard and Riverside. Some 1500 to 2000 vehicles reinforced the United Autoworkers picket line and prevented a violent assault by a joint force of  Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers. This police intervention resulted when the Windsor Police Commission (WPC) asked Ontario Attorney-General Leslie Blackwell for additional reinforcements, in an effort to aid in \"maintaining law and order.\"Mayor Reaume, based on his  support for the striking workers had opposed this action. Nonetheless, Blackwell approved the mobilization of 125 OPP officers into Windsor. In addition approximately another 125 RCMP officers were sent by the Government of Canada. The mobilization of some 250 OPP and RCMP officers authorized by Blackwell and Progressive Conservative Premier George Drew went against assurances they had made to Reaume, as David Moulton writes: \"that no police would be sent to Windsor.\" In addition the federal government was preparing armoured tank units in CFB Borden to break up the barricade. On November 5, Windsor City Council issued an ultimatum \"calling for the Ford strikers to remove the motor-car barricade outside the Ford plant or troops may be called in to remove the vehicles.\" Reaume consistently bucked decisions involving the use of police or force against the picket lines and others.\nUnited Auto Workers Local 200 President Roy England declared the WPC's recruitment and mobilization of the OPP and RCMP personnel was an \"attempt at strikebreaking\". In response Chrysler Local 195 voted to walk out in sympathy with the UAW Local 200 strike. The sympathy strike began 5 November 1945; this led to a mass exodus of workers from  twenty-five different plants, as a result another eight thousand workers flocked to the picket lines in support. Cross-Canada solidarity for the striking autoworkers was seen in places such as Sarnia, Brantford, St. Catharines, Oshawa, Fort William, Ottawa, Kitchener, Hamilton, and even as far away as Nova Scotia. This support varied in nature, from rallies, to other UAW locals stopping work, to American locals sending financial aid."

        "content": "After the sixteenth century, Monmouth was a centre for recusancy.  The town had, in 1773, one of the highest proportions of Catholics in England and Wales. The Penal Laws against Catholics were relaxed in 1778, through the Papists Act, and Monmouth magistrates were petitioned to erect a \"Public Catholick Chapel in the Town\". One of the petitioners, Michael Watkins, was then the landlord of the Robin Hood Inn in Monnow Street, where Mass had been celebrated hitherto in an upper room.  Lobbying resulted in permission being given for this church three years before a similar church in Chepstow.  However, because of a local by-law aimed at making Nonconformist and Catholic buildings as inconspicuous as possible, it had to concede that the building should not look like a church.  The entrance was not allowed to open on to the highway and Catholic worshippers were required to arrive at the chapel one at a time.  The church was originally set back discreetly from the road, concealed by a row of cottages.  The cottages were demolished in Bucknall's rebuilding, after discrimination against Catholics had been eased.The original building forms the area of the present sanctuary and sacristy, and the stained glass window to the left of the sanctuary is Georgian Gothic in style.  The earliest part of the church is the east end, of 1793.  In 1829 came Catholic Emancipation, and the chapel was extended in 1837 with the completion of the chancel, half the length of the present nave. This was followed in 1871 by an extensive rebuilding by Benjamin Bucknall.  This included the demolition of the cottages fronting the church and the erection of the tower and an elaborate frontage in Old Red Sandstone.  Newman describes the \"double bellcote crowned by a precipitously steep slate roof.\"  Internally, the font depicts the serpent of Eden entwined around the stem.From 1835 to 1851 the Roman Catholic priest in Monmouth was Thomas Burgess who went on to be the Bishop of Clifton."

He was martyred for his faith at Hereford on 22 August 1679 and lies buried at nearby Welsh Newton.  The Marches were an area where the old faith continued long after the Reformation, and many of the local big houses gave sanctuary to Catholic services conducted clandestinely by priests who could suffer extreme penalties if they were discovered.  The parish of St Mary's organises a pilgrimage to St John Kemble's tomb on the Sunday nearest to the date of his martyrdom.  The church also includes an altar dedicated to the saint's memory, which was used for the celebration of Mass during penal times at Pembridge Castle: this consists of two benches that could be separated to disguise its purpose. These historic buildings were refurbished in 2009/2010.The church possesses a fourteenth-century processional cross; an embroidered red chasuble dating from about 1502; and a hinged cross, possibly of Spanish origin, dating from the seventeenth century.\n\n\n== References =="

The street was also a boundary between large estates, such as the Bedford Estate and the Berners Estate. Maps show that the southern end of modern Cleveland Street, beyond Riding House Street, was known as Upper Newman Street and then Norfolk Street. The northern section was once known as Upper Cleveland Street and Buckingham Place.It became Cleveland Street for its full length after a renumbering was ordered by the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1867.The name comes from the Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland whose estate was connected in the 19th century with the Southampton (Wriothesley) property  via Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton.

UCLH NHS Foundation Trust in 2010 proposed the building's demolition in a planning application (and conservation area consent) submitted to Camden London Borough Council to replace it with a large building mixing private accommodation with commercial space. However adjoining Westminster City Council objected on three grounds on 2 December 2010.The Cleveland Street Workhouse is of particular importance in light of the fact that Charles Dickens is known to have lived nearby in what is now 22 Cleveland Street.  Dickens lived there as a young child between 1815 and 1816 and then again as a teenager between 1828 and 1831. His residence in the street has led to the suggestion that the nearby workhouse was probably the inspiration for Oliver Twist.Cleveland Street hosted the Middlesex Hospital, closed in 2005 and since demolished. The hospital occupied an entire block on the western side of the southern section of the street. The future of this site is currently uncertain, despite its sale by nationalised Icelandic Kaupthing Bank to Aviva Investors and Exemplar Properties.Cleveland Street was described as an area of special architectural and historic interest when it was designated a Conservation Area on 20 November 1990. Anomalously on its Camden side Cleveland Street is part of two conservation areas: the Fitzroy Square conservation area, and the Charlotte Street conservation area. This double designation is rare and possibly unique."

Previously owned by Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank and currently owned by SomeraRoad Inc, the 31-story, 420-foot (128 m) high structure was designed by architect Welton Becket and was completed in 1971. A notable feature of the building is the pattern of pre-cast concrete panels on the exterior of its windows. The building, originally named Citizens Fidelity Plaza, was named after Citizens Fidelity Bank and renamed PNC Plaza when Citizens Fidelity was acquired by PNC Bank.It was the tallest building in the state of Kentucky when it was completed in 1971, but lost that distinction a year later when National City Tower was completed in 1972. PNC now has offices in both buildings due to its own acquisition of National City Corp. in an unrelated move, however, it does not own National City Tower.\nThe Jefferson Club, a private city club, was located on the top floor of the building, until closing in February 2010.The building was purchased by Optima International, a firm based in Miami and run by Chaim Schochet, for a $77 million cash and mortgage assumption deal that closed on September 21, 2011.In 2019, Milwaukee-based financial services firm Baird purchased Louisville financial services firm Hilliard Lyons and became the anchor tenant, renovating and moving workers to the top five floors.In August 2020, Federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit claiming that the Ukrainian owners were laundering billions of dollars over more than ten years.In November 2020, the New York\u2013based private equity firm SomeraRoad bought the tower for $22.5 million, renamed it to \"500W\", and began renovation plans.  Vice President of SomeraRoad Andrew Marchetti said \"What we're doing is going to change the trajectory of 500 West. And it'll be noticeable,\" saying the company hopes to attract new tenants with these amenities and updates.  Spending $16 million, changes include a new entrance and lobby, a tenant lounge, a conference center, and fitness center.  Ev's Deli is currently the only caf\u00e9 or restaurant in the building.

Many members of the United Nations staff arriving with young families found unexpected difficulties with the school system in New York. Among them was K. T. Behanan and his wife, who arrived from India in May 1947 with their five-year-old son to help the UN's Trusteeship Council with educational policy. The Behanans banded together with other UN families who were in a similar situation to establish the United Nations International School at Lake Success, with Dr. Behanan as chairman of its board. The school was founded to provide an international education for students, while preserving its students' diverse cultural heritages. Today, UNIS has over 1,600 students in one campus in Manhattan, close to the Headquarters of the United Nations. The Manhattan campus, overlooking the East River, is K-12; until 2022, the school also ran a K-8 school at a campus in Jamaica Estates, Queens.UNIS was one of the pilot schools of the International Baccalaureate (IB) and was among those awarding the first IB diplomas. The comprehensive K\u201312 curriculum prepares UNIS students for the IB, and the school's internationally recognized academic standards attempts to enable students to go on to study in top colleges/universities both in the United States and the rest of the world.The main language used in the school is English, and all students study either French or Spanish from Kindergarten to the 12th Grade. Arabic, French, Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese and Russian are also taught beginning in the 7th Grade, where students are required to decide one of the seven languages to pursue further along with \"Language A\" English and \"Language B\" French or Spanish (Language C is Arabic, French, Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese, or Spanish). Students can also choose French or Spanish again for Language C, and must pursue the Language C until the 12th Grade. Additional languages can be studied by students within and external to the school during the weekend or after school during the school week. The school's current executive director is Dan Brenner.\nUNIS is a member of the Council of International Schools, the International Baccalaureate Organization, the European Council of International Schools, the New York State Association of Independent Schools, the National Association of Independent Schools and the College Board along with being registered to the New York Board of Regents as an independent, not-for-profit school."

The settlement was officially named \"New Glasgow\", after Glasgow in Scotland, in 1809, the same year its first trading post was developed.\nThe discovery of large coal deposits in the East River valley during the early 19th century saw New Glasgow, at the head of navigation, quickly develop into a manufacturing and port community.\nIn 1829, a horse-drawn tramway was built using standard gauge rails from the settlement of Albion Mines (now Stellarton) to a wharf near New Glasgow. This was the first use of standard gauge rails in what would become Canada. On September 19, 1839, the Albion Railway was opened from Albion Mines to New Glasgow, hauling coal wagons behind steam locomotives such as the Samson along the west bank of the East River of Pictou. This was the second steam-powered railway in what would become Canada, and the first to use iron rails. The railway was extended north to a coal loading pier at Dunbar's Point on May 14, 1840.\nIn 1840, George MacKenzie started the town's first shipbuilding company, which eventually built or owned 34 vessels; hundreds of ships would later be built along the East River in New Glasgow. In 1861 the clipper ship Sebastopol was built.In June 1867, the Nova Scotia Railway opened its \"Eastern Line\" from Truro through New Glasgow to its terminus at the passenger and cargo wharf in Pictou Landing. In 1882 the \"Eastern Extension\" of the Intercolonial Railway was opened from New Glasgow to Mulgrave on the Strait of Canso, placing New Glasgow on the mainline between Cape Breton Island and the North American rail network.\nEconomic development in New Glasgow was driven by the steel industry in neighbouring Trenton (site of the first steel manufacturing in Canada), shipbuilding and shipping in Pictou and Pictou Landing, and coal mining in Stellarton and Westville.\n\nAfter World War I, the famous New York sculptor J. Massey Rhind was commissioned to make the Nova Scotia Highlander soldier cenotaph. In 1946, New Glasgow was the setting for an important civil rights case when Viola Desmond challenged racial segregation of New Glasgow's Roseland Theatre. New Glasgow became a service centre for the county during the late 20th century as shopping centres, retail and residential development was spurred by the construction of Highway 104."

However, successive excavations on the Acropolis uncovered many new artifacts which significantly exceeded its original capacity.\nAn additional motivation for the construction of a new museum was that in the past, when Greece made requests for the return of the Parthenon Marbles from the United Kingdom, which acquired the items in a controversial manner, it was suggested by some British officials that Greece had no suitable location where they could be displayed. Creation of a gallery for the display of the Parthenon Marbles has been key to all recent proposals for the design of a new museum."

        "content": "The design by Bernard Tschumi was selected as the winning project in the fourth competition. Tschumi's design revolved around three concepts: light, movement, and a tectonic and programmatic element.\nThe collections of the museum are exhibited on three levels while a fourth middle-level houses the auxiliary spaces such as the museum shop, the caf\u00e9, and the offices. On the first level of the museum, there are the findings of the slopes of the Acropolis. The long and rectangular hall has a sloping floor, resembling the ascension to the rock. Following the hall is a large trapezoidal hall that contains the archaic findings. On the same floor, there are artifacts and sculptures from the other Acropolis buildings such as the Erechtheum, the Temple of Athena Nike, and the Propylaea and findings from Roman and early Christian Athens. Visitors are intended to see the latter during descent in order to keep the chronological order: they will first be directed to the top level, which displays the Parthenon marbles.\nThe top level of the Museum sits askew on the lower levels to achieve the same cardinal orientation of the ancient temple on the Acropolis.  The spacing of the columns of the Parthenon hall is the same as that of the ancient temple and the use of glass walls on all four exterior walls allows the natural light to illumine the Parthenon marbles as they do on the ancient temple.  Unlike the British Museum's Duveen Gallery, where the Parthenon marbles are displayed looking inwards, in the Acropolis Museum, the pediments, metopes and frieze are displayed facing outwards, as they did on Parthenon. The 48 columns in the Parthenon hall mark the outline of the ancient temple and form a colonnade for the display of the Parthenon marbles. For ease of viewing, the pediment marbles are displayed at eye level in front of the end columns; the metopes are displayed on the columns, two per column, but not as high as in the ancient temple; and the frieze are displayed behind the metopes, forming a continuous band around the walls of a rectangular space set inside the columns, as in the ancient temple but not as high, again for ease of viewing.  From the north side of the Parthenon hall, one can see the ancient temple above on the Acropolis. \nAs the museum is built over an extensive archaeological site, some parts of the floor uses glass to allow visitors to see the excavations below. The museum also has an amphitheatre, virtual theatre, and hall for temporary exhibitions."

        "content": "The River Stour (, pronounced rhyming with either \"tour\" or \"sour\") is a major river in East Anglia, England. It is 47 miles (76 km) long and forms most of the county boundary between Suffolk to the north, and Essex to the south. It rises in eastern Cambridgeshire, passes to the east of Haverhill, through Cavendish, Sudbury, Bures, Nayland, Stratford St Mary and Dedham. It becomes tidal just before Manningtree in Essex and joins the North Sea at Harwich.\nThe origins of its name are unclear, but several possibilities have been proposed by scholars. The entire non-tidal river above Manningtree is designated as the  Dedham Vale National Landscape, formerly known as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It has been painted by a number of prominent artists, including John Constable and Thomas Gainsborough.\nThe river was improved for navigation following the passing of an Act of Parliament in 1705. Locks were built to enable lighters to reach the town of Sudbury. Most of the locks were associated with mills, and the original 13 flash locks and 13 pound locks were replaced by 15 pound locks in the 19th century. The river was reasonably profitable at the beginning of the 19th century, but the advent of the railways led to a steady decline from 1852 onwards. Attempts to abandon it were thwarted by legal difficulties, but in 1914 the River Stour Navigation Company declared itself bankrupt, and the river soon became moribund. \nFrom 1928 onwards, the river became a major source of drinking water, with South East Essex Waterworks (now Essex and Suffolk Water) extracting water at Langham and then Stratford St Mary pumping stations. As the demand for water grew, the Ely-Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme was implemented, with water from the River Great Ouse discharged into the upper reaches of the river, and extracted again by the pumping stations. A third extraction point was added near Brantham, so that volumes of water flowing through Flatford could be maintained at a higher level for the benefit of tourists. To prevent salt water entering the river valley, sluices and a barrage were built at Cattawade, preventing boats from entering the river from the estuary.\nThe River Stour Trust was set up in 1968 to campaign for greater use of the river for navigation. It has worked to refurbish four locks, and to run boat trips from Flatford and Sudbury. The river can be used by unpowered craft between Sudbury and Cattawade, but powered boats are normally only allowed between Sudbury and Henny Mill, although the Trust has permission to run an electric boat at Flatford. Canoes and kayaks have to be portaged around the former locks where these have been replaced by fixed weirs and sluices."

        "content": "The name is of ambiguous and disputed origin.\nOn one theory, the name Stour derives from the Celtic sturr meaning \"strong\". However, the river-name Stour, common in England, does not occur at all in Wales; Crawford noted two tributaries of the Po River near Turin, spelled Stura. In Germany the Stoer is a tributary of the River Elbe. According to Brewer's Britain and Ireland the Stour is pronounced differently in different cases: the Kentish and East Anglian Stours rhyme with tour; the Oxfordshire Stour is sometimes rhymes with mower, sometimes with hour, and the Worcestershire Stour always rhymes with hour. Locally, the River Stour dividing Essex from Suffolk does not have a uniform pronunciation, varying from stowr to stoor.As against that, stour is a Middle English word with two distinct meanings and derivations, still current enough to appear in most substantial dictionaries. As an adjective, with Germanic roots, it signifies \"large, powerful\" (in present-day Scandinavian languages stor means \"big, great\"). As a noun, from medieval French roots, it signifies \"tumult, commotion; confusion\" or an \"armed battle or conflict\". Wiktionary also adds \"blowing or deposit of dust\", the primary definition in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, which adds that this is a northern English and Scottish usage of uncertain derivation. In 2006 it has been suggested that an Old European river-name was taken for an Old English adjective and that stour came to represent one pole of a structural opposition, with blyth at the opposite pole, allowing Anglo-Saxons to classify rivers on a continuum of fierceness.The Victorian etymologist Isaac Taylor proposed a very simple solution: that Stour derives from d\u0175r, the Welsh word for water.It is quite possible that the various Stours do not share a common origin and that they need to be considered in their own terms rather than as a single problem. Certainly there is currently no universally-accepted explanation."

        "content": "The river rises in Wratting Common, Cambridgeshire, to the south of Weston Colville, and passes near Great Bradley where it is joined by Kirtling Brook. It continues through Little Thurlow, Great Thurlow, Great Wratting, and Kedington before passing to the east of Haverhill, where the county boundary between Suffolk and Essex starts to follow its course. The villages of Wixoe, Stoke-by-Clare, Clare and Cavendish are all on the left bank of the river. The River Glem joins it on the left bank, before it passes to the west of Long Melford and then skirts the western and southern edges of Sudbury. It is crossed by the A131 road at Ballingdon Bridge, to the south-west of Sudbury, below which it is officially navigable. It continues through Bures and to the south of Nayland to reach the western edge of Stratford St Mary. Dedham is on the south bank and Flatford on the north bank. To the south of Brantham the river becomes tidal below Cattawade barrage, after which it opens out to become an estuary near Manningtree, and runs along the southern side of the Shotley Peninsula. The international port of Harwich is on the south bank, and it is joined by the River Orwell as it reaches the sea to the east of Harwich.The whole of the river valley above Manningtree is a designated National Landscape, formerly known as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The designated area is called Dedham Vale, and is named after the village of Dedham in Essex. It is an area of rural beauty on both sides of the river, covering around 35 square miles (90 km2) in total.The earliest known settlement on the river in Suffolk was at Great Bradley, where human occupation has been recorded for over 5,000 years. During the Anglo-Saxon era, the river became the boundary between the Kingdom of the East Saxons and the Kingdom of East Anglia. The Life of King Alfred records a naval battle taking place at the mouth of the river in 884, where Alfred the Great defeated a force of 13 Viking ships.The Stour valley has been portrayed as a working river by artists including John Constable, Thomas Gainsborough, Alfred Munnings, John Nash and Cedric Morris. Constable's connection with the area was especially important, evident in such works as The Stour Valley and Dedham Church c. 1815. John Nash, who was an official war artist, settled in the Stour valley and is buried at St Andrew's at Wormingford , one of its typically serene small settlements.The River Stour Trust, a waterway restoration group, was set up in 1968 to protect and enhance the right of the public to navigate the River Stour. The trust seeks to restore through navigation from Sudbury to the sea, following on the successful restoration of the locks at Stratford St Mary, Dedham, Flatford and Great Cornard, by reinstating the remaining locks. Meanwhile, the Trust encourages use of the river by small craft and organises annual events for all age groups and abilities on different parts of it. Boat trips and private charters, skippered by volunteer crews from the Trust, are available in Flatford and Sudbury between Easter and October. RSPB Stour Estuary is a nature reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). It is located on the south bank of the estuary, to the east of Wrabness. Just to the west is Wrabness Nature Reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest covering 69 acres (28 ha). It is run by the Essex Wildlife Trust and is also a designated Local Nature Reserve and a Local Wildlife Site.In July 2019 sections of the river ran dry because of low rainfall and debris blocking flows at Bures Mill. The Environment Agency pumped water from boreholes into the river in an attempt to restore water levels.The river from Cattawade barrage to Orwell Haven is tidal and used by large ships. The channel is dredged to 17 feet (5 m), and this section should only be navigated by those experienced in tidal river navigation. Coasters travel up the river as far as the quay at Mistley."

        "content": "There are no known records detailing use of the river by boats prior to the 17th century, but in 1634, Daniel Biatt, the mayor of Sudbury, met with Mr Doctor Warren and Mr Spencer to plan how to make the river navigable. On 11 December 1638 Spencer obtained Letters Patent authorising him to make the river navigable from Manningtree to Sudbury. No progress was made, due to unrest around the time of the civil war, Spencer's pre-occupation with a similar project on the River Ouse, and his own financial difficulties. A similar scheme was proposed by Mr Maynard in 1658, but again no progress was made. By the late 1600s, John Little and Benjamin Dodd had obtained the rights of the Letters Patent, and later claimed they had spent a lot of money improving the river.What they did is unknown, for in 1703 the mayor and corporation of Sudbury presented a bill to Parliament to make the river navigable. Little and Dodd objected, as they already had rights under the Letters Patent, but their case was dismissed, and an Act of Parliament was granted to Sudbury on 16 February 1705. It was entitled An Act for making the River Stower navigable from the town of Manningtree, in the county of Essex, to the town of Sudbury, in the county of Suffolk. A long list of commissioners was established, and the work was to be carried out by the mayor and aldermen of Sudbury and ten others. It had to be started before 24 June 1708 and completed by 24 June 1713. In order to placate the millers, they were given rights to carry millstones and building materials for their mills without payment of tolls. A towpath would be provided on parts of the river, but the path was intermittent.The act also allowed winches and other engines to be set up on the banks, so that boats could be hauled through the flash locks which were built. A total of 13 flash locks and 13 pound locks were constructed. The posts on which the lock gates hung were continued above the top of the lock, and a lintel spanned the lock to prevent the posts collapsing inwards. Timber sides to the locks later replaced the earth walls, and in the 19th century the flash locks were removed, while the pound locks were rebuilt, so that there were 15 between Sudbury and the estuary.Unusually for a navigation, the Act did not specify how money to fund the project should be raised. In practice, 48 shares with a value of \u00a3100 were issued. Cornelius Denn bought 24, while the other 24 were split between Dean Cock and some clothiers from Sudbury. Denn and Cock were both merchants from London. This provided insufficient capital to complete the work, and the subscribers were asked for more money. \u00a39,000 was raised, of which \u00a36,500 was spent on the navigation works, \u00a3800 on 16 barges, and \u00a31,700 on warehousing and other amenities. It is not known if there was an official opening, but in May 1709 barges carried 2,211 tons of coal from Manningtree up the navigation to Sudbury. The company was continually short of money, and in 1722 Daniel Defoe noted that the navigation was not really adequate. The company ceased in 1736 to be solely responsible for barge traffic on the river, and allowed anyone to use it on payment of a toll.The Commissioners failed to elect new members as older ones died, and by the 1770s there were only two left. Since a quorum of 15 was required to appoint new commissioners, a second Act of Parliament was obtained in 1781. New commissioners included Golding Constable, the father of the painter John Constable, and two brothers of the painter Thomas Gainsborough, Samuel and John. The act also empowered the new commissioners to build a towpath along the entire navigable section, and to maintain bridges, stiles and gates. Golding Constable and William Strutt had surveyed the river by September 1782, and a programme of dredging was carried out. Income from tolls was \u00a3700 in 1782, but this had doubled by 1817, with a large proportion of the revenue derived from the carriage of coal."

        "content": "After the Navigation Trust declared itself bankrupt, the state of the river steadily declined, as locks decayed and fallen trees were not removed from the river. The lack of maintenance resulted in flooding of agricultural land, and so the Ministry of Agriculture created a Drainage Board responsible flood control of the area in 1918. Three years later, they requested the Navigation Trust to remove the locks at Horkesley and Boxted, and to permanently open the paddles on the locks at Langham and Stratford St Mary, to aid the passage of water down the river. Numerous meetings took place over the following two decades, but little was achieved, and the river continued to deteriorate. Meadows near Flatford were regularly flooded by water passing up the south channel, and while tides passing up the north channel normally only reached Judas Gap, high spring tides could sometimes reach Flatford. The South Essex Waterworks Company wanted to extract more water from the river immediately following the Second World War, and this was granted on condition that they improved flood defences where the river reached the estuary. This work involved improving the weir at Judas Gap, and constructing a barrage across the south channel. It had 56 gravity-controlled gates, which could be used to allow fresh water to leave the river, but prevent salt water from entering it, and was known as the 56 Gate. Following its completion in 1948, land upstream of the 56 Gate was reclaimed for argicultural use.In the aftermath of the North Sea flood of 1953, much thought was given as to how to protect coastal communities from such events, and in 1969 a new flood defence scheme was implemented. A dam with a sluice through it was built across the north channel below Cattawade Bridge at Brantham, while sluice gates were fitted across the south channel. The project also included building Cattawade Bypass, which travels over the flood defence dam at Brantham. These changes meant that there was fresh water habitat all the way down to the defences. A new weir containing a fish pass replaced the structure at Judas Gap, and this has resulted in the mill pond at Flatford always being fairly full, even in dry summers. The 56 Gate was no longer needed and the work, which was paid for jointly by Suffolk County Council and the Essex Water Company, was completed in 1971."

        "content": "The river and its tribtaries have been an important source of power to the communities that live near them since at least the time of the Domesday Book of 1086. Some 45 water mills are known to have existed along their banks. Many of the sites are identifiable from modern maps. In some cases, either the mill or the associated mill house is named, while in others, multiple channels and an obvious mill pond show their location. Below Sudbury, most of the locks were associated with a mill. None of the mills are still operational, but where the buildings still exist, most are now listed buildings. Because the river forms the boundary between Suffolk and Essex for most of its length, those on the left bank are generally in Suffolk, and those on the right bank are in Essex. The furthers upstream is Kedington, where a mill was known to exist in 1066, but had been demolished by 1086. The present building dates from the 18th century, and was a corn mill until 1901. It is Grade II listed, as is the adjacent 17th-century mill house. Wixoe Mill is also an 18th-century building, constructed with a timber frame with weatherboarding on a brick base. The mill house and stables are nearby.Baythorne Mill in Birdbrook dates from the 18th century, but was extended in the 19th century, when a building to house a steam engine and a tall chimney were added. It retains its mill wheel, although it is not operational, and some rare early leaded glass windows. At Clare, the 19th-century mill house survives but the mill building was destroyed by fire in 1978. At Pentlow, a long range dating from the 18th century contains both the mill and the mill house. The timber frame is clad with red bricks, and both parts are now residential. At Lyston Mill, the weather-boarded timber-framed mill house remains, although the mill itself was demolished in 1887 after a period of disuse. Borley Mill is a large timber-framed structure with three storeys, with a gabled lucombe projecting from the roof. It was a corn mill until 1916, and was then used to produce anilmal feed until it closed in 1969. In the 1940s there was probably a steam engine at the site, but the tall chimney has since been demolished. On the outskirts of Sudbury, the building at Brundon Mill dates from the 18th century. Water power was supplemented by a steam engine from 1857 until cereal milling ceased in 1923. It was converted into a house in 1932. Sudbury Mill is a four-storey structure, parts of which date from the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it date from 1890. The water wheel, installed in 1889, still turns, although it does not drive machinery. A steam-powered roller mill was added in the early 20th century, and it was producing animal feed when it closed in 1964. The building is now the Mill Hotel.\nGreat Cornard was the first site where a lock was needed to navigate around the mill. The mill house dates from the 18th century, with later additions. The family of Edward Baker ran the mill from 1851 to 1967, after which it produced animal feed. The site has since been redeveloped for housing. Great Henny is another site where only the mill house survives. It is an early 19th-century timber-framed building with a hipped slate roof. The mill ceased production before the Second World War, and was subsequently damaged by bombing, leading to it being demolished when the war ended. Bures Mill is a timber-framed building, parts of which are weatherboarded, but much of it is now covered in corrugated asbestos panels. Wiston or Wissington Mill is Grade II* listed. It dates from the 18th and 19th centuries, and internally still contains the milling machinery, while externally parts of the water wheel remain. Part of the mill has been converted into a house, including a wing dating from the 16th century.Boxted Mill house is a two-storey building with attics, but the mill building was demolished in the 1920s. At Langham, there was a corn mill and a fulling mill in 1086, but the fulling mill was demolished around 1510. In 1752, it was recorded that the remaining mill could fulfil either function. The builing was reconstructed in brick around 1779, and ceased operating in 1912. It was later demolished to make way for a pumping station. Flatford Mill is well known because of the paintings of John Constable. It carries a date stone showing 1733, but may include some earlier material. The structure includes a granary to the rear, and a 19th-century wing adjoining the granary. Much of it is constructed of red brick, with some weatherboarding. It was owned and operated by the Constable family from the mid-18th century until 1901, when milling ceased, due to competition from more efficient mills. After a period of decay it was restored and given to the National Trust, and is now leased to the Field Studies Council, who operate a field studies centre there. It is Grade I listed, because of its association with Constable. In 2012, an Archimedes screw turbine was installed at the mill. Rated at 11 kW, it was expected to provide around a third of the energy used by the field studies centre. Work has since been carried out to improve the efficiency of the turbine, and to install a fish pass. The lowest mill on the river was Brantham or Green's Mill, which was recorded in 1086. It may have been a tide mill at that time, and was definitely so later on. It was rebuilt in 1778, and subsequently became a steam-powered roller mill, producing cereals. It ceased to operate in the 1930s, although it was used as a pepper mill during the Second World War, but was damaged during the conflict. The remains were destroyed by fire in 1965."

        "content": "The river plays an inportant role in the supply of drinking water to residents of Essex. Langham Mill had ceased to operate by 1924, and in 1928 South East Essex Waterworks (now Essex and Suffolk Water) obtained permission to demolish it, in order to construct a pumping station on the site. It was licensed to abstract 12 million imperial gallons (55 Ml) per day, which was treated at a works to the west, and then pumped to a reservoir at Danbury, from where it flowed to another reservoir at Herongate, suppliying customers in Romford, Ilford and Barking, Essex, in what is now part of Greater London. Reconstruction of the locks at Stratford, Dedham, Flatford and Brantham was a condition of the planning consent for the works. Although not a listed building, the pumping station was added to the Local List in 2020. It is constructed of concrete with a pitched roof, in the International Modernist style popular at the time, and is painted white. At the treatment works, the control room, primary filter house and chemical house are all built in the same Modernist style, and were listed because they form a good example of the style in largely unaltered form. There is a detached house and six semi-detached houses built in a similar style to the south of the works, probably designed as housing for the staff, and a service reservoir to the east with its own Modernist pumping station.\nAlthough the Langham pumping station was completed in 1932, the company was convinced that it would be short of water by 1940, and obtained a second Act of Parliament to allow it to build an extraction point at Stratford St Mary. Water would be pumped southwards to Abberton Reservoir, construction of which was authorised by the same Act. The consents allowed the company to extract up to 35 million imperial gallons (160 Ml) per day, but required that 4 million imperial gallons (18 Ml) per day must continue down the river to Flatford and beyond. This was more than the river could supply, and so only the minimum allowed continued downstream. This reduced flow caused tides to flow upstream as far as Flatford, and the salt content of the tidal water was highly detrimental to the flora and fauna of the river corridor. The solution adopted was to build a further extraction point at Brantham, which meant that the flow past Stratford St Mary could be increased to 7 million imperial gallons (32 Ml) per day, and the extra abstracted at Brantham.The continued expansion of housing stocks in south-east Essex meant that still more water was needed and in 1964, the Ely-Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme was initiated. Water from the River Great Ouse was transferred along the Cut-off Channel to an intake at Blackdyke, from where it flows by gravity to a pumping station at Kennett. It is then pumped to Kirtling Green where it discharges into Kirtling Brook, a tributary of the Stour. The extra water flows along the Stour, where some of it is abstracted by a pumping station at Wixoe for transfer by pipeline to Great Sampford where it discharges into the River Pant, the name of the upper reaches of the River Blackwater. The remaining water increased the flow on the Stour to the pumping stations further downstream. In 2006, further extensions were made to the scheme, as part of a plan to increase the capacity of Abberton Reservoir by 60 percent. Essex and Suffolk Water can extract 99 million imperial gallons (450 Ml) per day from the Great Ouse, and the Kirtling Brook was too small to cope with this amount. A gravity pipeline was therefore built between Kirtling Green and Wixoe. Downstream, a new pumping station was built at Wormingford, which supplies a pipeline running to the western end of Abberton Reservoir. By 2019, Brantham was licensed to abstract between 1.13 and 1.87 million cubic feet (32 and 53 Ml) per day, which flows from the river to the Brantham pumping station by gravity, and is then pumped to Abberton Reservoir by one fixed-speed and two variable speed pumps.To comply with the Eels (England and Wales) Regulations 2009, new screens were required on the intake from the river at Brantham, to prevent young eels, known as elvers, from being sucked into the machinery and killed. The new screens were positioned on the river side of the existing intake structure, and the rotating bandscreen was supplied by Hydrolox in 2019. It is 13 feet (3.9 m) wide and 15 feet (4.7 m) tall, and the 0.079-inch (2 mm) mesh was much finer than the course mesh originally in use at the site. A comprehensive upgrade of the Stratford St Mary's pumping station was undertaken in 2020, in view of the ageing technology and the fact that it is now licensed to abstract 36 million imperial gallons (164 Ml) per day, more than four times the amount for which it was originally designed. The pumps were replaced, allowing the volume of water removed from the river to vary between 4.4 million imperial gallons (20 Ml) per day to the full amount of the licence. New screens were required on the intake from the river, to protect elvers. A rotating screen supplied by Hydrolux was selected after considering various options, and this was cantilevered off the existing bandscreen building, to minimise disturbance to the river bed."

Some sources suggest that the village was named after the Portuguese factor and traveller Duarte Barbosa, though this seems unlikely as he never actually resided in the area. More recently though the village Barbodhan has become known as the 'Golden Village'. The village has existed for many years, and tombstones in the graveyard indicate that Muslims were buried there some three to four hundred years ago.

People left Barbodhan in the early 19th century to settle in Burma, where they established many businesses and were great entrepreneurs; a number of them even became advisors to the Burmese rulers. Then from in the 1840s many other emigrants from Barbodhan went to the island of Mauritius, where they were later responsible for introducing hydroelectric power, as well as being involved in other trading and business concerns. The first Muslim mayor in Mauritius was originally from Barbodhan.\nThen came the migration to England from the 1950s to the 1970s. Once immigration to the United Kingdom became more difficult, a number of Barbodhians then left for Canada particularly during the period from the 1970s to the 1990s. A considerable number of Barbodhians undertook further migrations from one of these countries to another; such as from Burma to England, England to Canada or Mauritius to England. Despite the fact that Barbodhan is only a small village, its people have made valuable contributions in societies around the world. Barbodhians have set up many Waqfs or Religious Foundations to help poor, needy, disadvantaged and unfortunate members of society, particularly in Burma and Mauritius.\nThe largest population of Barbodhians outside India is in Bolton, Greater Manchester, where the community settled in the 1950s and 1960s. The first ever Elected Member on Bolton Council of Indian origin was from Barbodhan. There is also a large number of settlers from Barbodhan in Preston, also in Lancashire, where the Barbodhan Muslim Welfare Society (UK) was set as early as 1960.\nThere are currently two mosques, two temples, one madressa, one school and one library in the village. There is a large pond in the village of Barbodhan which is the biggest pond in the Olpad Taluka. It covers an area of around 999 vigha (250 acres/101.17 hectares)."

It was subsequently used by the 1994 Winter Paralympics for Paralympic Nordic skiing and Paralympic biathlon. After the games, ownership was transferred to the municipal Lillehammer Olympiapark. The venue has since been used for one Biathlon World Cup, three FIS Cross-Country World Cup and nine FIS Nordic Combined World Cup tournaments, the latter with the ski jumping competition taking place at the nearby Lysg\u00e5rdsbakkene Ski Jumping Arena.

        "content": "The location of the venue was decided in January 1990, following Lillehammer's successful bid to host the 1994 Winter Olympics. Construction was managed by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC). Architects were 2\u00d8 Arkitekter and the main consultant was Tonning & Lieng. Construction started in early 1991, before planning was completed, and lasted until 1993. The construction work was subcontracted to several companies. Landscaping was completed in 1994. The facilities used concrete and wood as the main materials. The stadium included 3,000-square-meter (32,000 sq ft) of temporary buildings, a 1,620-square-meter (17,400 sq ft) building converted to a riding center after the Olympics, and a 3,200-square-meter (34,000 sq ft) tent. The land around the venue is a swamp, and most of the surface soil had to be removed and replaced with harder earth. The soil was used as fertilizer or fill in other parts of the arena. A creek had to be bypassed with a 220 meters (720 ft) long pipe. The arena is also so flat that a drainage system had to be installed. After the Olympics, four temporary overpasses were removed. Construction of the tracks was done to minimize the impact on the forest.The venue cost NOK 83.6 million, and was inaugurated on 28 November 1992 with an international biathlon competition. In December 1992, the LOOC stated that they wanted to upgrade the stadium spectator capacity, but that the transport systems would not allow more people. In 1993, the stadium had World Cup tournaments in biathlon and cross-country skiing as a trial before the Olympics. During several events, the computer system controlling the scoreboard and television scores collapsed. President Johan Baumann of the Norwegian Ski Federation criticized the venue and demanded that a new stadium be built. He stated that the stadium had been built to optimize television pictures, and that it had insufficient facilities for the spectators. In particular, he criticized the fact that the spectators were too far away from the skiers and the lack of a television screen and more scoreboards. In May, the LOOC announced that the stadium would be expanded for another 6,000 people before the Olympics. On 7 September, the ownership of the venue was transferred from the LOOC to Lillehammer Municipality via the subsidiary Lillehammer Olympiavekst, which later changed its name to Lillehammer Olympiapark. In October, the forest along the tracks were partially cleared to allow spectators without tickets to watch the events."

For the Olympics, 27 kilometers (17 mi) of cross-country tracks and 9 kilometers (5.6 mi) of biathlon tracks were built. There are two stadiums, one for cross-country skiing and one for biathlon. The former has a spectator capacity for 31,000, while the latter has a capacity for 13,500. In addition, up to 75,000 people watched the events the trackside during the Olympics. Permanent buildings include a 214-square-meter (2,300 sq ft) finishing house for biathlon, a 155-square-meter (1,670 sq ft) finishing house for cross-country, a 355-square-meter (3,820 sq ft) plant room. The cross-country stadium is 200 square meters (2,200 sq ft) long, while the biathlon stadium is 150 square meters (1,600 sq ft) long. The biathlon stadium has 30 shooting stations. The facility has a 1,250 kVA transformer, with an additional transformer used during the Olympics. Critical systems, such as computers and time-keeping equipment, have an uninterruptible power supply.As a recreational venue, Birkebeineren connects to 450 kilometers (280 mi) of skiing tracks, including a 5 kilometers (3 mi) lighted track which is lit until 22:00 every day during winter, and is open to the public. During the summer, the tracks are available for jogging, running, roller skiing and similar activities. There is a caf\u00e9 between the two stadiums, which also have dressing rooms and showers. The biathlon venue can be rented to hold private biathlon competition, with or without skis.The dominant means of transport during the Olympics was by railway. Spectators heading to Birkebeineren were transported by train to Hovemoen Station on the Dovre Line, and would then be transported by shuttle bus to the stadium. In addition, spectators from certain areas were transported by bus directly to the stadium."

Immediate surrounding areas include the old mining hamlet of Vale of Clwydd and Oakey Park, a famous iron and steel village, of which fiery night scenes have been depicted in many paintings, as well as large areas of bush and state forest. The next city to the West is Bathurst, 60 km (37 mi) away.\nLithgow is in the NSW State electorate of Bathurst, while federally it is part of electorate of Calare. Lithgow benefits from being the western terminus for the electric section of the Main Western railway line from Sydney, and of NSW TrainLink's Blue Mountains Line electric services. Lithgow is home to the iconic zig-zag railway."

        "content": "The mountainous terrain of the Blue Mountains and the expense of building long tunnels required the construction of the Lithgow Zig Zag between 1866 and 1869. The line was opened as far as Bowenfels, just to the west, in 1869, but Lithgow station was not opened until 1877. Although it was superseded in 1910 by more modern engineering methods, including ten tunnels, parts of the Zig Zag have been developed into a popular tourist attraction. Following a period of industrialisation in the late 1860s and 1870s, the town of Lithgow boomed during the 1880s, and it was incorporated as a borough in 1889.The town situated in the centre of a coal mining district and there is one coal-powered power station nearby. It is the site of Australia's first commercially viable steel mill, the ruins of which are open for inspection at \"Blast Furnace Park\". Due to the abundance of coal and relative proximity to Sydney, in the areas surrounding Lithgow is one of the largest power stations in NSW, the Mount Piper Power Station. The Wallerawang Power Station closed in 2014 and was subsequently demolished. The (now demolished) Lithgow Power Station was operational from 1928 to 1964."

Sportswriters commonly used Coogan's Bluff as a sobriquet for the Polo Grounds\u2014as Chavez Ravine refers to Dodger Stadium and China Basin to Oracle Park\u2014although the ballpark was actually situated in Coogan's Hollow, the bottomland between the bluff and the river. The Coogan heirs continued to own the land on which the Polo Grounds stood even though the Giants owned the stadium. This stymied the Giants' efforts to maintain the stadium and was a factor in their decision to move to San Francisco after the 1957 season.\nBefore the opening of the first Yankee Stadium in 1923, the New York Yankees shared the Polo Grounds with the Giants for ten seasons (1913\u201322). For their first 31 years, the football Giants of the National Football League (NFL) played home games at the Polo Grounds (1925\u201355), then went to Yankee Stadium. After four seasons without a baseball team (1958\u20131961), the expansion New York Mets were tenants in 1962 and 1963, then moved to the new Shea Stadium in northern Queens in 1964. The New York Titans/Jets of the American Football League (AFL) played their first four seasons at the venue (1960\u201363), then also left for Shea in 1964.\n The Bushman Steps, located just west of Coogan's Bluff in Sugar Hill/Hamilton Heights, led from the 155th Street subway station to the Polo Grounds ticket booths; the John T. Brush Stairway, on West 157th Street between St Nicholas Avenue and Edgecombe Avenue, then carried fans the rest of the way down to the stadium. The two stairways are the only intact structures that remain from the Polo Grounds era. The Brush Stairway was named in honor of the owner of the Giants franchise from 1890 until his death in 1912. The identity of the namesake of the Bushman Steps has apparently been lost."

Because of the eastward current of the air in Tehran and its constant purification by the adjacent mountains, this town is less polluted compared to other northern parts of the city. These and many more advantages have made this area a prime and pleasant location for living, attracting many foreign temporary residents, diplomats and expatriates."

The Permian Basin is a geologic region, about 300 miles (480 km) long and 250 miles (400 km) across, which was downwarped during the Permian period.  During this time it filled with water and became a sea, while the subsidence continued.  Over tens of millions of years the sea filled with sediments \u2013 principally limestones and dolomites in the area of the Yates Field \u2013 and then as the sea evaporated, those sedimentary rocks were capped with a large layer of evaporites, such as potash and sea salt.  These stratigraphic sequences are among the thickest collections of Permian rocks in the world.  In areas where large anticlines formed, oil from deeper-lying source rocks was trapped in permeable rocks such as the limestone and dolomite underneath the impermeable cap of evaporite sediments.\nIn the Yates Field, the two richest oil-bearing rocks are the Grayburg Dolomite and San Andres Formation.  The Grayburg is cavernous, having once been a tropical island with fresh water carving holes in the limestone, creating a karst terrain; the San Andres consists of fractured, dolomitized carbonates, and like the Grayburg contains copious free space in which petroleum accumulated over the eons.  Some of these oil-filled caverns are as high as 21 feet (6.4 m).  In addition to these two units, the Queen Formation, which contains interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and dolomite, and the complex Seven Rivers Formation, contain recoverable quantities of oil.  Capping all four units is a salt layer in the Seven Rivers Formation."

        "content": "The land which the field underlies was owned by Ira and Ann Yates, ranchers in the hardscrabble Trans-Pecos region of West Texas (the town of Iraan is named for them: Ira+Ann).  Yates had recently purchased the ranch, and was having difficulty making sufficient profit to pay the mortgage and taxes; on a hunch, he invited Michael Late Benedum's Transcontinental Oil Company to explore his land for oil.  In 1926, a partnership consisting of Mid Kansas Oil Company (part of The Ohio Oil Company, the ancestor of Marathon Oil) and Transcontinental Oil, drilled an exploratory well, the Yates No. 1-A, on the Yates ranch into the San Andres formation approximately 1,000 feet (300 m) below ground surface, and hit a rich productive zone, producing a \"gusher\" \u2013 an uncontrolled spew of crude oil, under intense pressure, into the air.  Lacking any other means of containment, the crew dammed a nearby draw to build a holding pond for the oil.  Other wells drilled nearby also hit substantial quantities of oil \u2013 it seemed to be everywhere.  Both Yates and the oilmen immediately recognized the significance of their find.Unfortunately for the early development of the field, oil production and transportation infrastructure was lacking nearby.  Early drillers needed huge holding tanks, pipelines, or rail sidings; until these could be built or supplied, no oil could be transported to buyers.  Humble Pipe Line Co., an ancestor of Exxon Company, was the nearest to have any facilities at all \u2013 a pipeline that went to McCamey, in Upton County, about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of the production area.  Humble began construction of a 55,000-barrel (8,700 m3) storage tank to hold the oil, but even that was insufficient for the colossal quantities of crude that flowed from the field. Many of the early wells on the Yates Field were phenomenally productive; the first five wells, by spring 1927, together produced an average of 9,009 barrels per day (1,432.3 m3/d), far more than could be stored or moved.  The sixth well drilled, Yates 6-A, blew out due to extreme gas pressure, and 500 barrels per day (79 m3/d) blew through the damaged well onto the ground, pooling in nearby canyons.  Operators were able to retrieve most of it by damming the canyons and sucking the oil up with pumps.Environmental standards were lax to nonexistent in the early days of the industry, and poorly constructed wells in the field often leaked crude from unsealed portions of the casing.  Much of this oil migrated upwards, contaminating the Pecos River.  Thousands of barrels per day were recovered by skimming the river, as well as drilling shallow wells, above the capping geologic formation, capturing oil before it reached ground surface.  Over 3 million barrels (480,000 m3) of oil was eventually recovered, all from seepage from poorly cased wells.Production from the field peaked in 1929, with a total production of 41 million barrels (6,500,000 m3) of oil.  That year also saw the spudding of well Yates 30-A, which blew out with the spectacular flow of 8,528 barrels (1,355.8 m3) per hour, and over 200,000 in a day, setting the world record; even the Lakeview Gusher at the Midway-Sunset field in California, which spewed a total of approximately 9 million barrels (1,400,000 m3) in its 18-month uncontrolled run, only attained half of that daily flow rate.  Because of the high production rate from the field and lack of storage and transport, the State of Texas Railroad Commission \u2013 the entity that oversees petroleum production \u2013 required a proration of the field for the first time in Texas history.  Under this rule, all operators were given an equal share in the pipeline outlet based on what their wells could produce, based on the total field production.  Additionally, operators were restricted in the depth they could drill into the prolific reservoir, to give each an equal advantage.When the field was discovered, an instant boomtown sprung up in the form of tents and shanties around a red barn on the Yates Ranch, about three miles (5 km) south of present-day Iraan.  This town, unsurprisingly named Redbarn, acquired a post office, general store, hotel, filling station, and restaurant, but never had a permanent population greater than 75.  Ira Yates, owner of the ranch and oil field, donated 152 acres (0.62 km2) of his land for the townsite of Iraan, which town survives to the present day.  Redbarn was abandoned in 1952.The two major early operators of the field, Ohio Oil and Mid-Kansas, merged in 1962 to form Marathon Oil, which ran the field until 2003.  By 1966 production had diminished due to depletion of many of the major reservoirs, and between 1968 and 1972 Marathon operated a waterflooding program on the west side of the field, along with a CO2-injection regime.  Both of these enhanced recovery technologies increased pressure in the field, allowing increased oil recovery, which approximately doubled as a result.  In the late 1970s, production again dropped, and Marathon commenced another waterflood project, this time followed closely by a pattern polymer flood.  The polymer flood was ended in 1989.  The 1 billionth barrel of oil was produced on January 11, 1985. Between 1985 and 1991, Marathon injected more CO2 into the central, eastern, and northern parts of the field; all of these activities improved production.In 1992 there were 1,100 active production wells, along with 57 injection wells.  Careful study of the fractured nature of the oil-bearing geologic units allowed operators to shut down almost 400 of the least efficient wells without diminishing the overall output of the field.The current operator of the field is Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, who acquired it from Marathon Oil in 2003.  Currently there are over 360 productive oil wells."

The Mississippian culture rulers organized thousands of workers to construct complex earthwork mounds at what later became St. Louis and East St. Louis. The center of this culture was the urban complex of Cahokia, located to the north of present-day East St. Louis within Collinsville, Illinois. Before the Civil War, settlers reported up to 50 mounds in the area that became East St. Louis, but most were lost to 19th-century development and later roadbuilding.\nEast St. Louis lies within the fertile American Bottom area of the present day Metro-East area of St. Louis, Missouri. This name was given after the United States acquired the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, and more European Americans began to settle in the area. The village was first named \"Illinoistown\".\nEast St. Louis was founded in 1797 by Captain James Piggott, a Revolutionary War veteran. In that year Piggott began operating a ferry service across the Mississippi River, connecting Illinoistown with St. Louis, which had been founded by ethnic French families. When Piggott died in 1799, his widow sold the ferry business, moved to St. Louis County and remarried. One of the Piggotts' great-great-granddaughters became known as actress Virginia Mayo (Virginia Clara Jones).The municipality called East St. Louis was established on April 1, 1861. Illinoistown residents voted on a new name that day, and 183 voted to rename the town East St. Louis. Though it started as a small town, East St. Louis soon grew to a larger city, influenced by the growing economy of St. Louis, which in 1870 was the fourth-largest city in the United States."

These settlers built the Middle Spring Presbyterian Church, among the oldest houses of worship in central Pennsylvania, in 1738 near present-day Shippensburg, Pennsylvania.\nThe General Assembly (legislature) of the Pennsylvania colony on January 27, 1750, created Cumberland County from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, naming it for Cumberland, England. Its county seat is Carlisle.  The county also lies within the Cumberland Valley adjoining the Susquehanna River at its eastern border, stretching approximately 42 miles from the borough of Shippensburg on the west to the Susquehanna River in east Cumberland County.\nThe oldest towns in the county are Shippensburg and Carlisle, each with its unique history. Shippensburg is home to Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, one of 14 universities of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. Carlisle is also home to Dickinson College, established in 1773, and the Penn State Dickinson School of Law.\nThe United States Army War College is a United States Army school located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on the 500 acres (2.0 km2) campus of the historic Carlisle Barracks, a military post dating back to the 1770s. It caters to high-level military personnel and civilians and prepares them for strategic leadership responsibilities. It is the U. S. Army's most senior military educational institution.\nDuring the Gettysburg campaign of the American Civil War in the summer of 1863, Confederate troops marched through the Cumberland Valley, briefly occupying much of the county.\nIn the 20th century, the suburbs of Harrisburg, the state capital, expanded extensively into eastern Cumberland County.

Founded and opened in 1934, it holds collections from the mid-19th century that were  amassed substantially by major American art and sculpture collectors, including William Thompson Walters and his son Henry Walters. William Walters began collecting when he moved to Paris as a nominal Confederate loyalist at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, and Henry Walters refined the collection and made arrangements for the construction what ultimately was Walters Art Museum. \nAfter allowing the Baltimore public to occasionally view his father's and his growing added collections at his West Mount Vernon Place mansion during the late 1800s, Henry Walters arranged for an elaborate stone palazzo-styled structure to be built for this purpose in 1905\u20131909, located a block south of the Walters mansion on West Monument Street/Mount Vernon Place, on the northwest corner of North Charles Street at West Centre Street.\nThe mansion and gallery were also just south and west of the landmark Washington Monument in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, just north of the downtown business district and northeast of Cathedral Hill. Upon his 1931 death, Henry Walters bequeathed the entire collection of then more than 22,000 works, the original Charles Street Gallery building, and his adjacent townhouse/mansion just across the alley to the north on West Mount Vernon Place to the City of Baltimore, \"for the benefit of the public\". The collection includes masterworks of ancient Egypt, Greek sculpture and Roman sarcophagi, medieval ivories, illuminated manuscripts, Renaissance bronzes, Old Master European and 19th-century paintings, Chinese ceramics and bronzes, Art Deco jewelry, and ancient Near East, Mesopotamian, or ancient Middle East items. Dorothy Miner became its first Keeper of Manuscripts in 1934 and held the post until her death in 1973.\nIn 2000, \"The Walters Art Gallery\" changed its long-time name to \"The Walters Art Museum\" to reflect its image as a large public institution and eliminate confusion among some of the increasing out-of-state visitors. The following year, \"The Walters\" (as it is often known locally) reopened its original main building after a dramatic three-year physical renovation and replacement of internal utilities and infrastructure. The Archimedes Palimpsest was on loan to the Walters Art Museum from a private collector for conservation and spectral imaging studies.\nStarting on October 1, 2006, the museum was enabled to make admission free to all, year-round, as a result of substantial grants given by Baltimore City and the surrounding suburban Baltimore County arts agencies and authorities.  In 2012, \"The Walters\" released nearly 20,000 of its own images of its collections on a Creative Commons license, and collaborated in  their upload to the world-wide web and the Internet on Wikimedia Commons. This was one of the largest and most comprehensive such releases made by any museum."

        "content": "The Gabriele\u00f1o indigenous group inhabited Irvine about 2,000 years ago. Gaspar de Portol\u00e0, a Spanish explorer, came to the area in 1769, which led to the establishment of forts, missions and cattle herds. The King of Spain parceled out land for missions and private use.\nAfter Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican Congress passed the Mexican secularization act of 1833 which secularized the missions and resulted in the Mexican government assuming control of the lands of said missions. It began distributing the land to Mexican citizens who applied for grants. Three large Spanish/Mexican land grants, also known as ranchos, made up the land that later became the Irvine Ranch: Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, Rancho San Joaquin and Rancho Lomas de Santiago.\n\nIn 1864, Jose Andres Sepulveda, owner of Rancho San Joaquin, sold 50,000 acres (200 km2) to Benjamin and Thomas Flint, Llewellyn Bixby and James Irvine for $18,000 to resolve debts due to the Great Drought. In 1866, Irvine, Flint and Bixby acquired 47,000-acre (190 km2) Rancho Lomas de Santiago for $7,000. After the Mexican-American war the land of Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana fell prey to tangled titles. In 1868, the ranch was divided among three claimants as part of a lawsuit: Flint, Bixby and Irvine. The ranches were devoted to sheep grazing. However, in 1870, tenant farming was permitted.\nIn 1878, James Irvine acquired his partners' interests for $150,000 ($4,735,862 in 2023 dollars ). His 110,000 acres (450 km2) stretched 23 miles (37 km) from the Pacific Ocean to the Santa Ana River. James Irvine died in 1886. The ranch was inherited by his son, James Irvine II, who incorporated it into the Irvine Company. James Irvine II shifted the ranch operations to field crops, olive and citrus crops.\nIn 1888, the Santa Fe Railroad extended its line to Fallbrook Junction, north of San Diego, and named a station along the way after James Irvine. The town that formed around this station was named Myford, after Irvine's son, because a post office in Calaveras County already bore the family name. The town was renamed Irvine in 1914.\nBy 1918, 60,000 acres (240 km2) of lima beans were grown on the Irvine Ranch. Two Marine Corps facilities, MCAS El Toro and MCAS Tustin, were built during World War II on ranch land sold to the government.\nJames Irvine II died in 1947 at the age of 80. His son, Myford, assumed the presidency of the Irvine Company. He began opening small sections of the Irvine Ranch to urban development.\nThe Irvine Ranch played host to the Boy Scouts of America's 1953 National Scout Jamboree. Jamboree Road, a major street which now stretches from Newport Beach to the city of Orange, was named in honor of this event. David Sills, then a young Boy Scout from Peoria, Illinois, was among the attendees at the 1953 Jamboree. Sills came back to Irvine as an adult and went on to serve four terms as the city's mayor.\nMyford Irvine died in 1959. The same year, the University of California asked the Irvine Company for 1,000 acres (4 km2) for a new university campus. The Irvine Company sold the requested land for $1 and later the state purchased an additional 500 acres (2.0 km2).William Pereira, the university's consulting architect, and the Irvine Company planners drew up master plans for a city of 50,000 people surrounding the new university. The plan called for industrial, residential and recreational areas, commercial centers and greenbelts. The new community was to be named Irvine; the old agricultural town of Irvine, where the railroad station and post office were located, was renamed East Irvine. The first phases of the villages of Turtle Rock, University Park, Westpark (then called Culverdale), El Camino Real, and Walnut were completed by 1970.\nOn December 28, 1971, the residents of these communities voted to incorporate a substantially larger city than the one envisioned by the Pereira plan. By January 1999, Irvine had a population of 134,000 and a total area of 43 square miles (111 km2).After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, a large influx of Vietnamese refugees settled in nearby Fountain Valley, especially in the late 1970s and throughout the 80s, forming a large percentage of Asian Americans in the city.\nIn late 2003, after a ten-year-long legal battle, Irvine annexed the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. This added 7.3 square miles (19 km2) of land to the city and blocked an initiative championed by Newport Beach residents to replace John Wayne Airport with a new airport at El Toro.  The Orange County Great Park was developed there."

Carter of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Savannah Office  issued a survey report that recommended the construction of dams on the Savannah River in order to prevent flooding in Augusta, Georgia. His report was overlooked until the 1927 Rivers and Harbors Act allowed the USACE to investigate development of the Savannah River for the purpose of hydroelectricity, navigation, flood control, and irrigation. In 1933, the USACE completed its report for the entire Savannah River Basin and recommended against government flood control development of the basin but proposed two hydropower dams in the upper Savannah Basin, the Hartwell and Clark Hill dams.The Flood Control Act of 1950 authorized the Hartwell Dam and Reservoir as a development project of the Savannah River Basin. Construction on the dam began in 1955 and the plan called for a three-mile long structure containing four hydroelectric generators with a combined 264 MW capacity. Predicting future demand requirements, the ability to install a fifth generator in the future was provided. Of the dam's length, 1,900 ft is a concrete gravity dam, the rest being compacted earth.\nA year before its completion, in February 1961, the dam began to inundate a portion of the Savannah River to create the reservoir. In March 1962, the reservoir was complete behind the dam and the four original hydro-power generators went online in April. The original projected cost of the dam was US$68.4 million but when completed was just over US$89.2 million. In 1983, the fifth generator was installed on the dam, raising the generation capacity to 344 MW."

        "content": "In June 2007, drought triggered Level 1 conditions, resulting in reduced flows of 4,200 cubic feet per second (120 m3/s). 2 months later in August, Level 2 was triggered, resulting in a 4,000 cu ft/s (110 m3/s) release. After receiving federal and state agency authorization, the flow was again reduced to 3,600 cu ft/s (100 m3/s) in October 2007. In August 2008, to maintain mid-term hydroelectric output and reservoir levels, releases below 3,600 cu ft/s (100 m3/s) (a goal of 3,100 cu ft/s (88 m3/s)) were explored and temporarily implemented. The flows were increased back to 3600 feet sec in February 2009 to prevent environmental damage. In October 2009, the Savannah River Basin transitioned out of drought and normal flows should soon resume.The 2007-2009 drought raised controversy over the Southeastern Power Association's (SEPA) role of controlling the Hartwell Dam. Complaints arose that the dam was releasing excess water in order to provide cheap power to communities. In addition, environmental controversy arose as to whether the releases and subsequent draining of the reservoir during a severe drought was necessary."

Money was sent to purchase forty acres of land for a town site by several benevolent Moravian sisters. It was their wish that town lots be sold and the money be used to build a Moravian Church. The families made the long journey to Iowa and acquired many acres of land.The town site of Moravia was laid out on June 27, 1850 and was recorded July 15, 1851. The surveying was done using a pocket compass and tapeline for measuring instruments. The old ridge road from Unionville, Iowa to Moravia and west to Iconium, Iowa supplied part of the Mormon Trail of 1846 from Nauvoo, Illinois to Salt Lake, Utah.Moravia observed its sesquicentennial anniversary (150th birthday) July 4, 2001. The sesquicentennial anniversary was celebrated with a giant birthday party with events scheduled all day. A Moravian Church was built and dedicated in 1851. The early Moravian Families honored the customs of the Moravian Church, which was founded in the country of Moravia in 1597.\nSeveral of these customs are remembered and celebrated today in Moravia's annual events and festivals. Since the town was founded, it has experienced a rich tradition in the customs of the town's Moravian founders. The Moravia Tour of Homes is an example of a custom founded in the country of Moravia.\nChristmas time was a time for Moravians to visit their neighbors and view their colorful Christmas decorations. This custom is remembered and practiced at Christmas time each year by The Moravia Tour of Homes. Another Moravian custom relived each year at Christmas time in Moravia is the Lovefest. The love fest is a traditional religious service with music provided, usually by local talent. Moravian refreshments are served in the tradition of the early Moravians."

The school drew 841 students from Minneapolis, Edina and Richfield its first year. Several additions were made to the original structure. The first - a second gymnasium and several new classrooms in an area later known as the \"North\" building - opened in 1956; additionally, Southwest became a 7-12 school that same year. The second was an entirely new building that became Southwest Junior High and was connected via a single hallway, opening in 1968; the new building containing another gymnasium, a new library, and a pool. With the new gymnasium in the \"East\" building, the gymnasium in the original structure was turned into a 700-seat auditorium.With the reorganization of Minneapolis schools in 1982, Southwest returned to just grades 9\u201312, with seventh and eighth graders going to Anwatin and Anthony Middle Schools. Most of the students who attended West High School were transferred to Southwest when it was closed the same year.In 1987, the International Baccalaureate Programme began at Southwest. Currently, all 9th and 10th grade students follow the IB Middle Years Programme curriculum.Also in 1987, Southwest High School was one of the first high schools in the country to stop using a Native American for its mascot and nickname. The Southwest student body voted to change the nickname of the school from the Indians to the Lakers.In 1998\u20131999, the classrooms in the North building were enlarged to become science laboratories. This same renovation included more new classrooms, a new gymnasium floor, and bleachers.In 2006, a new equipment and weight lifting area was designed in the vocational end of the North building. Over the next few years, the entire interior structure of the auditorium was removed starting with the concrete floor and ending with the new roof. The stage and part of the original gym floor, now the orchestra pit, are all that remain of the previous structure. A new audio-video control booth, catwalks, seating, and acoustic walls were added as well.In 2016, the Minneapolis school board approved a $47+ million renovation which would add a new building and let the school have space for 450 new students. The expansion was completed for the 2016\u201317 school year and added 20 new classrooms. The new 60,346 square foot building was constructed between the original east (Southwest Junior High building) and west buildings. As a part of the renovation, 12,400 square feet of the east building was demolished. The main offices of the school were moved to the new structure, and a large part of the 60,346 square foot building was the new 10,000 square foot lunch room. The renovation also included mechanical upgrades like air conditioning that classrooms in the school had never had before."

During the early 20th century, the land on which The Oval stood was given in perpetuity to Glentoran by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Daniel Dixon.Due to its proximity to the Belfast shipyards, the Oval suffered severe bomb damage during the Belfast Blitz in 1941. Aerial bombing destroyed both grandstands, causing the loss of Glentoran's club assets, and also left a large crater in the pitch. As a result, the ground was flooded repeatedly by the Connswater River; the water pumps were insufficient to drain the pitch. The ground was out of use until 1949 when it was rebuilt by the Glentoran club along with supporters, who had jointly formed the 'Back to the Oval' committee. During their exile, the club played games at the ground of fellow Belfast club, Lisburn Distillery \u2013 Grosvenor Park.\nIn 1953, the main grandstand was built.In September 1995, Glentoran had an advertising board with \"JESUS\" in white letters on a black background erected at the Oval. This became known colloquially as the \"Jesus sign\". It remained at the ground until 2010 when Glentoran officials removed it, saying that they needed the space to sell advertising because of the club's serious financial troubles and because \"The sign had garnered no income for Glentoran for several years.\"In 2000, the Oval received funding for the refurbishment of the railway stand, by bolting seats on to the old terracing to create a 1,600-capacity stand. It was funded by a small grant as part of the much bigger \u00a32,000,000 investment in Northern Irish sports announced by Sports Minister Michael McGimpsey.\nOther than new floodlights and a small section of terrace refurbishment, the ground has not applied for nor received any public investment since. \nIn 2005, after a match between Glentoran and rival team Linfield, Linfield fans broke down a gate in The Oval to access the pitch and throw objects at Glentoran fans in the main stand after both sets of fans had been throwing missiles at each other beforehand. Two people were charged with rioting.In 2008, The Oval was the site of a protest by the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster against a decision by the Irish Football Association to allow football matches to be played on Sundays, a first in Northern Ireland due to traditional sabbatarianism. The protesters were concerned that regular Sunday matches would attract churchgoers away from attending church. The protest was led by Reverend David McIlveen, who said \"Fundamentally, it is a desecration of God's day.\" In October 2010 the neo-Nazi British National Party (BNP), who were trying to gain electoral support, held a rally outside the Oval. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Member of the Legislative Assembly, Robin Newton described the BNP's presence outside The Oval as \"nauseous\". In July 2011, an incendiary bomb was discovered outside The Oval requiring evacuation of surrounding streets. In October 2011 during an Irish Cup match between Glentoran and Portadown, a Portadown fan threw fireworks onto the pitch, injuring Glentoran's assistant manager Pete Batey and goalkeeping coach Davy McClelland.In the 21st century, with the continued lack of investment, the Oval has become comparatively dilapidated and has required constant temporary repairs to fulfill health and safety requirements for Glentoran to continue hosting its home matches there. In 2009, Glentoran's Irish Cup match against Limavady United was abandoned after the stadium's floodlight pylons started shaking in the high winds and the referee deemed it too dangerous for the match to continue. In 2012, after considering selling naming rights to The Oval, Glentoran unveiled plans to move the club to a new stadium in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast. The Oval was sold to property developers in March 2013 for \u00a34 million. Glentoran's chairman suggested that the Oval might be redeveloped into social housing.In March 2021, Glentoran submitted plans to Belfast City Council for a major revamp for the football ground. The plans include an entire revamp of the ground, this would include building two new stands totalling 4,000 seats, and two standing terrancings at each end of the pitch with capacity 1,000 each, bringing the stadium capacity to 6,000 spectators, it is estimated to cost between \u00a38 and \u00a310 million."

        "content": "The Oval is located near the Port of Belfast, and Harland and Wolff's Samson and Goliath cranes are visible from inside the stadium. It is viewed as a historic ground by football fans because of its concrete terraces and steel fencing. This limits its capacity in UEFA-sanctioned matches to the 3,000 seats in the two main stands as terracing has not been permitted in UEFA matches since 1998.The stadium's capacity is 26,556, but was estimated in 2010 by the Northern Ireland Assembly to have a safe capacity of 5,056 under safety legislation. However, since 2011, the safe capacity permitted by Health and Safety authorities is 5,300; before 2010 the stadium could hold more than 8,000. Linfield's manager David Jeffrey criticised these restrictions and said that they were \"murdering local football.\" The main stand holds 2,720 and the Railway stand holds 2,070. The Oval's record attendance is 55,000 for a European Cup Winners Cup match against Rangers on 27 September 1966.The design of the main stand is very similar to the one at Springfield Park, former home of Wigan Athletic. This was also built in 1953."

During the 1870s other pioneers opened up the area to settlement. In 1912 the need for a school to serve the local area soon became apparent in this small but fast-growing area; the Finger family donated two acres of land on the southern side of Mountain Hwy (then known as Wantirna-Sassafras Rd) and a timber schoolhouse was opened. The Finger and Fankhauser families were prime movers in the erection of the Methodist Church opened opposite the school in May 1914, and a parish hall was built on Burwood Highway in 1924. Wantirna Post Office opened on 1 November 1913, closed in 1977, and reopened in 1983. The Wantirna Reserve was provided by the council in 1925 and a tennis court was built there shortly afterwards. In December 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, West Prussia Road was renamed Wantirna Road.\nLocations in Wantirna, especially Westfield Knox, are occasionally used to shoot the soap opera Neighbours. Koomba Park is a large native bushland park spanning the area between Dandenong Creek and the Eastlink Tollway. It is run by Parks Victoria and was opened in 1982. The Victorian Jazz Archive is located in Koomba Park."

        "content": "Tarrant Gunville is a village and civil parish in north Dorset, England, situated at the head of the Tarrant Valley on Cranborne Chase five miles (eight kilometres) northeast of Blandford Forum. The parish covers 3,469 acres (1,404 hectares) at an elevation of 70 to 170 metres (230 to 560 feet). In the 2011 census the parish\u2014which includes the settlement of Stubhampton to the north\u2014had 119 dwellings, 108 households and a population of 233.The parish has three round barrows and an unexcavated Iron Age enclosure with a 15' deep ditch, which Pevsner suspects was built in a hurry.\nThe medieval settlements in the parish were Stubhampton and Gunville. The parish church, dedicated to St Mary, is on the edge of Tarrant Gunville. It is on the site of an earlier building which probably dated from around 1100. The present building has a south porch, aisles and tower arch that are partly 14th-century, and a 15th-century west tower that was partly rebuilt in the 16th century, but the chancel and nave were rebuilt in 1843. The architect of the rebuilding was Thomas Henry Wyatt.\nEastbury House, the surviving part of a much larger house designed by John Vanbrugh and built between 1717 and 1738, stands just east of Tarrant Gunville village. The larger part of the house was demolished in 1782. The grounds still display evidence of the original gardens, designed by Charles Bridgeman. It is probable that several of the ashlar and flint houses in the village were built using material taken from the demolished house. The photographer Thomas Wedgwood moved into the surviving part of Eastbury in 1800; his brother, the potter Josiah, had bought nearby Gunville House in 1799, shortly after its construction.The modern village hall was completed in 2001.\nThere are 23 structures in the parish that are listed by English Heritage for their special historical or architectural interest. These include Eastbury House (Grade I) and the parish church (Grade II*)."

The islands are also sometimes referred to by mariners as the Devil's Teeth Islands, in reference to the many treacherous underwater shoals in their vicinity. The islands lie 30 miles (48 km) outside the Golden Gate and 20 miles (32 km) south of Point Reyes, and are visible from the mainland on clear days. The islands are part of the City and County of San Francisco. The only inhabited portion of the islands is on Southeast Farallon Island (SEFI), where researchers from Point Blue Conservation Science and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stay. The islands are closed to the public.The Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge is one of 63 national wildlife refuges that have congressionally designated wilderness status. In 1974, the Farallon Wilderness was established (Public Law 93-550) and includes all islands except the Southeast Island for a total of 141 acres (57 ha).

        "content": "The peaks of the Farallon Islands are visible from coastal areas of San Francisco and Marin County, so the Native Americans who lived in the San Francisco area were aware of them, and believed them to be an abode of the spirits of the dead. They are not believed to have traveled to the islands.The first Europeans to see these islands were most probably the members of the Juan Cabrillo expedition of 1542, which sailed as far north as Point Reyes, but no source record of the Cabrillo expedition's actual sighting of these islands has survived. The first European to create a record of the islands that has survived was the English privateer and explorer Sir Francis Drake, on July 24, 1579. On that day, Drake landed on the islands to collect seal meat and bird eggs for his ship. He named them the Islands of Saint James because the day after his arrival was the feast day of St James the Great. The name of St James is now applied to only one of the rocky islets of the North Farallons.The islands were apparently first given their names \"Farallones\" (literally, \"cliffs\") by Friar Antonio de la Ascencion, aboard the Spanish explorer Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno's 1603 expedition. De la Ascension wrote in his diary, \"Six leagues before reaching Punta de los Reyes (Point Reyes) is a large island, two leagues from land and three leagues northwest of this are . . . seven farallones close together.\" It is believed that probably for the next two centuries after Drake first recorded their existence, their rather ominous appearance, lying just off the entrance to San Francisco Bay, most likely caused the earlier mariners to prefer to skirt far to the west and offshore from the entrance to the bay, thus leading to the much later discovery of the San Francisco Bay by land over two centuries after the 1542 discovery of the islands. In 1769, the bay inlet was finally discovered soon after an overland sighting of the bay was made from what is now the Pacifica area.In the years following the discovery of the islands, during the maritime fur trade era, the islands were exploited by seal hunters, first from New England and later from Russia. The Russians maintained a sealing station in the Farallones from 1812 to 1840, taking 1,200 to 1,500 fur seals annually, though American ships had already exploited the islands. The Albatross, captained by Nathan Winship, and the O'Cain, captained by his brother Jonathan Winship, were the first American ships sent from Boston in 1809 to establish a settlement on the Columbia River. In 1810, they met with two other American ships at the Farallon Islands, the Mercury and the Isabella, and at least 30,000 seal skins were taken. By 1818, the seals diminished rapidly until only about 500 could be taken annually and within the next few years, the fur seal was extirpated from the islands. Whether the northern fur seal or the Guadalupe fur seal were the islands' native fur seal is unknown, although the northern fur seal is the species that began to recolonize the islands in 1996.On July 17, 1827,  French sea captain Auguste Duhaut-Cilly sailed by the southernmost Farallon Island and counted the \"crude dwellings of about a hundred Kodiaks stationed there by the Russians of Bodega...the Kodiaks, in their light boats, slip into San Francisco Bay by night, moving along the coast opposite the fort, and once inside this great basin, they station themselves temporarily on some of the inner islands, from where they catch the sea otter without hindrance.\"After Alta California was ceded by Mexico to the United States in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the islands' environment became linked to the growth of the city of San Francisco. Beginning in 1853, a lighthouse was constructed on SEFI. As the city grew, the seabird colonies came under severe threat as eggs were collected in the millions for San Francisco markets. The trade, which in its heyday could yield 500,000 eggs a month, was the source of conflict between the egg-collecting companies and the lighthouse keepers. This conflict turned violent in a confrontation between rival companies in 1863. The clash between two rival companies, known as the Egg War, left two men dead and marked the end of private companies on the islands, although the lighthouse keepers continued egging..\nFrom 1902 to 1913, the former U.S. Weather Bureau maintained a weather station on the southeast island, which was connected with the mainland by cable. The results of the meteorological study were later published in a book on California's climate. Temperatures during those years never exceeded 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) or dropped to 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C). Years later, the National Weather Service provided some weather observations from the lighthouse on its local radio station.\nThe islands have also been mentioned in connection with the schooner Malahat as one possible site for Rum Row during Prohibition.A high-frequency direction finding (HFDF) station was established here by the Navy during World War II. These radio intercept sites along the coast could track Japanese warships and merchant marine vessels as far away as the Western Pacific.  The other stations  in California were at Point Arguello, Point Saint George, and San Diego. Bainbridge Island, Washington also hosted a station. The United States Coast Guard maintained a staffed lighthouse until 1972, when it was automated."

This was expanded to the other islands in 1969 when it became a national wildlife refuge. In 1981, Congress designated the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, which spanned 1,279 square miles (3,313 square kilometers; 966 square nautical miles) of water surrounding the islands. This sanctuary protected open ocean, nearshore tidal flats, rocky intertidal areas, estuarine wetlands, subtidal reefs, and coastal beaches within its boundaries. In 2015, the sanctuary was enlarged north and west of the original boundary, partially surrounding Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, to encompass 3,295 square miles (8,534 square kilometers; 2,488 square nautical miles), and the name was changed to Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. The sanctuary is contiguous with both the Cordell Bank sanctuary and another sanctuary to the south, Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The islands are managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the Marin-based Point Blue Conservation Science (formerly Point Reyes Bird Observatory). The islands are currently the subject of long term ecological research. The Farallones are closed to the public, although birders and wildlife enthusiasts can approach them on whale watching boats, shark and marine policy education with the non profit Shark Stewards  and the sail-training vessel Seaward out of Sausalito."

In Schalchmatthau there is the foundation of a rectangular Roman era farm with a portico and flanked by two wings. Also from the Roman era, there is a 1st\u20133rd century villa and a bathhouse with heated rooms. Near the villa, an Alemanni graveyard was also discovered. During initial excavation, the wall remains were uncovered in 1897\u201398. Then, between 1975 and 1980 the wall ruins were preserved.The modern village of Oberlunkhofen is first mentioned in the 9th century as Lunchunft though this record comes from an 11th-century copy of the original, older document. In 1232 it was mentioned as Lunchuft and in 1309 as obern Lunchuft. There was a castle near the village, but no surviving records mention it. It was presumably destroyed in 1386.\nThe village was owned by St. Leodegar in Lucerne which was under the jurisdiction of Murbach Abbey and was sold in 1291 to the House of Habsburg. In the early 14th century is a center of the Habsburg region of Kelleramt. The rights to the low justice and the vogtei fell on Bremgarten in 1414. In 1415, the rights to high justice went to Zurich. In 1797 Bremgarten sold the village to the other four municipalities of the Kelleramt. In 1798 it became part of the short-lived Helvetic Republic Canton of Baden.\nSt. Leodegar, the parish church of the Kelleramt, was first mentioned in 1185. The church was under the jurisdiction of St. Leodegar in Lucerne and then Murbach Abbey. In 1291 it went to the Habsburgs, and in 1403 was awarded Muri Abbey which held it until 1841. The parish included Oberlunkhofen, Unterlunkhofen, Arni, Islisberg and Rottenschwil. The current parish church was built in 1685 on the site of a 1515 church building. The oldest church building on that site probably dates from the 10th century.\nUntil the 20th century the major industries were agriculture and viticulture. In 1920 the bus line Oberlunkhofen-Jonen-Affoltern am Albis opened. Then in 1930 the line Birmenstorf-Oberlunkhofen opened. This line expanded in 1966 Zurich-Wiedikon. The increase in population after 1980 is due people moving away from the Zurich agglomeration."

The station serves the Lakes and Seacoast Regions of New Hampshire, and is currently owned by Educational Media Foundation.The station signed on in 1999 with a deep oldies format as WZEN, competing with WQSO. WZEN adopted the WMEX letters shortly after they were dropped by what is now WQOM (1060 AM) in 2001. The WMEX call letters, which were also used during the 1980s on what is now WWDJ (1150 AM) in Boston as well as WCLX in Westport, NY in the Burlington, VT market, refer to a popular top-40 station of the 1960s and 1970s on 1510 AM in Boston, Massachusetts (which has since reclaimed the WMEX call sign).\nOn January 28, 2008, AllAccess.com reported that the station was in the process of being sold to the Educational Media Foundation for $1 million.\nOn June 2, 2008, the station went out with the Righteous Brothers' \"Rock n Roll Heaven\" as its last tune. While the station changed its call letters to WKHL, implying that it would join K-LOVE, the station ended up joining sister network Air 1 instead. A few weeks later, the call sign was again changed, this time to the current WNHI."

Its area is 247 km2, and its population is 251,682 (2022). It is on the Mediterranean coast. Located on an alluvial plain, the city was heavily damaged by powerful earthquakes in February 2023 and subsequent aftershocks, floods and fires.\nThe city's history dates back to 333 BC, when it was founded by Alexander the Great as Alexandretta. It subsequently fell under Seleucid rule before being conquered by the Romans. After defeating the Byzantines in the 8th century, the Abbasid Caliphate gained control of the city. During the First Crusade, it came under the control of the Principality of Antioch before being captured by the Mamluk Sultanate.\nBy the 15th century, the Ottomans had conquered the city, maintaining control over it until the partition of the Ottoman Empire after the Allied victory in World War I. It subsequently became a sanjak in the French mandate of Syria until 1938, when France granted the region independence. The city became part of the Hatay State which in turn united with Turkey in 1939."

Although Calais is by far the largest city in Pas-de-Calais, the department's prefecture is its third-largest city of Arras. The population of the city proper is 67,544; that of the urban area is 144,625 (2020). Calais overlooks the Strait of Dover, the narrowest point in the English Channel, which is only 34 km (21 mi) wide here, and is the closest French town to England.  The White Cliffs of Dover can easily be seen on a clear day from Calais.  Calais is a major port for ferries between France and England, and since 1994, the Channel Tunnel has linked nearby Coquelles to Folkestone by rail.\nBecause of its position, Calais  has been a major port and an important centre for transport and trading with England since the Middle Ages. Calais came under English control after Edward III of England captured the city in 1347, followed by a treaty in 1360 that formally assigned Calais to English rule.  Calais grew into a thriving centre for wool production, and came to be called the \"brightest jewel in the English crown\" because of its importance as the gateway for the tin, lead, lace and wool trades (or \"staples\"). Calais remained under English control until its capture by France in 1558.\nDuring World War II, the town was virtually razed to the ground: in May 1940, it was a strategic bombing target of the invading German forces who took it during the siege of Calais.  The Germans built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles at England.\nThe old part of the town, Calais-Nord, is on an artificial island surrounded by canals and harbours. The modern part of the town, St-Pierre, lies to the south and south-east. In the centre of the old town is the Place d'Armes, in which stands the Tour du Guet, or watch-tower, a structure built in the 13th century, which was used as a lighthouse until 1848 when a new lighthouse was built by the port. South east of the Place is the church of Notre-Dame, built during the English occupancy of Calais. Arguably, it is the only church built in the English perpendicular style in all of France. In this church, former French President Charles de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux. South of the Place and opposite the Parc St Pierre is the H\u00f4tel-de-ville (the town hall), and the belfry from the early 20th century. Today, Calais is visited by more than 10 million annually. Aside from being a key transport hub, Calais is also a notable fishing port and a centre for fish marketing, and some 3,000 people are still employed in the lace industry for which the town is also famed."

Aside from being an important port and boarding point between France and England, it is at the nucleus of many major railway and highway networks and connected by road to Arras, Lens, B\u00e9thune and St. Omer. Dunkirk is located about 37 km (23 mi) to the east. Calais is located 236 km (147 mi) north of the French capital of Paris, or around 295 km (183 mi) by car. The commune of Calais is bordered by the English channel to the north, Sangatte and Coquelles to the west, Coulogne to the south and Marck to the east. The core area of the city is divided into the Old Town area within the old city walls, and the younger suburbs of St. Pierre, which are connected by a boulevard.\nCalais is part of the C\u00f4te d'Opale (Opal Coast), a cliff-lined section of northern French coast that parallels the white cliffs on the British coast and is part of the same geological formation. It is known for its scenic cliffs such as Cape Blanc Nez and Cape Gris Nez and for its wide area of dunes. Many artists have been inspired by its landscapes, among them the composer Henri Dutilleux, the writers Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens, and the painters J. M. W. Turner, Carolus-Duran, Maurice Boitel and Eug\u00e8ne Boudin. It was the painter \u00c9douard L\u00e9v\u00eaque who coined the name for this area in 1911 to describe the distinctive quality of its light.Calais has a temperate oceanic climate (Cfb in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Temperature ranges are moderate and the winters are cool with unstable weather. It rains on average about 700 to 800 mm (28 to 31 in) per year.\n\nThe commune of Calais is divided into 13 quartiers :"

It is the principal ferry crossing point between England and France, with the vast majority of Channel crossings being made between Dover and Calais. Companies operating from Calais include SeaFrance (currently in liquidation), DFDS Seaways, and P&O Ferries. The French end of the Channel Tunnel is situated in the vicinity of Calais, in Coquelles some 4 miles (6.4 km) to the west of the town. Calais possesses direct rail links to Paris, 148 miles (238 km) to the south. More than 10 million people visit Calais annually.From medieval times, English companies thrived in Calais. Calais was a particularly important centre in the production and trade of wool and cloth, which outweighed the costs of maintaining the town as part of England. In 1830 some 113 manufacturers were based in Calais and the St Pierre suburbs, the majority of which were English. There are still two major lace factories in Calais with around 700 looms and 3000 employees. The town exports in the early 20th century were lace, chemicals, paper, wines, especially champagne, spirits, hay, straw, wool, potatoes, woven goods, fruit, glass-ware, lace and metal-ware. Principal imports in the early 20th century included cotton and silk goods, coal, iron and steel, petroleum, timber, raw wool, cotton yarn and cork. During the five years 1901\u20131905 the average annual value of exports was \u00a38,388,000 (\u00a36,363,000 in the years 1896\u20131900), of imports \u00a34,145,000 (\u00a33,759,000 in 1896\u20131900).As a fishing port, Calais has several notable fishing markets including Les D\u00e9lices de la Mer and Hu\u00eetri\u00e8re Calaisenne on the Boulevard La Fayette, the latter of which is noted for its oysters, lobster and crabs from Brittany. The Emile Fournier et Fils market on the Rue Mouron sells mainly smoked fish including salmon, trout, herring and halibut."

Besides the above-mentioned Hexenturm near the old Nassau castle, the town has a mediaeval town centre with many timber-frame buildings. The town's oldest preserved house was originally built in 1410.\nFrom the documentary mention in 1102 until 1721, Idstein was, with interruptions, residence of the Counts of Nassau-Idstein and other Nassau lines. One of the Counts, Adolf of Germany, was, as a compromise candidate, the Holy Roman Emperor from 1292 to 1298, later falling in battle against the anti-king Albrecht I of Habsburg.\nThe Nassau Counts' holdings were subdivided many times among heirs, with the parts being brought together again whenever a line died out. This yielded an older Nassau-Idstein line from 1480 to 1509, later merging once again with Nassau-Wiesbaden and Nassau-Weilburg and, from 1629 to 1721, a newer Nassau-Idstein line.\n\nIn the 17th century, Count Johann of Nassau-Idstein persecuted witches in Idstein.In 1721, Idstein passed to Nassau-Ottweiler, and in 1728 to Nassau-Usingen, thereby losing its status as a residence town, although it became the seat of the Nassau Archives and of an Oberamt.\nNassau-Usingen was united with Nassau-Weilburg in 1806 into the Duchy of Nassau, becoming a member of the Confederation of the Rhine. After the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, Prussia annexed the Duchy as the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau.\nThe residential palace from the 17th century is used by the Pestalozzischule as a school building. It was expanded with a new building below the palace.\nFrom the late 18th century to the mid 20th, Idstein was the centre of an important leather industry. During the Second World War, many women became forced labour for work in the tanneries. In 1959, the dominant tannery in the middle of the town core was shut down for economic reasons. The lands right at the edge of the Old Town lay empty and were used until the 1980s as a carpark. Today, new shops and apartments surround the L\u00f6herplatz, which is now a marketplace.\n\nThe private Kalmenhof clinic in Idstein was drawn into the Nazi Euthanasia programme. Under Action T4, the Kalmenhof served as a way station for Hadamar killing centre. After the gassings at Hadamar came to an end in the face of public protests, especially from the churches, the Kalmenhof itself, in the course of Aktion Brandt, became a killing institute; patients here were murdered with poison injections.Shortly after the war, reports of young wards being mishandled came to light.Eleven formerly independent villages were merged as of 1971 into Idstein, under the framework of municipal reform."

In 1872, SFTS began with four professors and four students meeting for instruction at the Presbyterian City College and Calvary Presbyterian Church, located at what now is Union Square, and St. John's Presbyterian Church. Six years later, the seminary moved to its own building next to the City College building on Haight Street.The seminary moved in 1891 to a 14-acre (57,000 m2) hilltop site in Marin County about 15 miles (24 km) north of the Golden Gate Bridge. A new charter issued in 1900 gave the seminary power to grant degrees, and jurisdiction over the seminary was transferred from the synod to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in 1913.In the post World War II era under its president, Jesse Hays Baird, SFTS enjoyed unprecedented expansion, with enrollment increasing to more than 300 and new buildings rising all over the San Anselmo campus. SFTS joined in 1962 with neighboring graduate schools and academic centers in founding the Graduate Theological Union in  Berkeley. The GTU developed joint M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in cooperation with the graduate school at the University of California Berkeley.In 1990, SFTS opened its second campus in Pasadena, which was housed in the Pasadena Presbyterian Church. Due to seminary budget cuts, the board of trustees voted to close the Pasadena campus in February 2011. However, despite the announced closure, the seminary continued to consider alternative opportunities to expand their programs in Southern California.\nIn February 2019, SFTS announced its intention to become part of the University of Redlands, based in Southern California's Inland Empire region. The merger was complete on July 1, 2019, and SFTS was embedded within a new Graduate School of Theology that carried SFTS programs forward and expanded opportunities for its students.In consequence of the merger, the PCUSA General Assembly's Committee on Theological Education (COTE) removed SFTS from its roster of Presbyterian Seminaries, and the Presbyterian Foundation withheld payments from a portion of SFTS endowment that it held in trust,\non the grounds that the seminary no longer exists as an incorporated entity. While SFTS maintained its commitment to  Presbyterian 'theological education', the PC(USA) was unconvinced. \u201cAfter six years, there is no requirement of any Presbyterians on the UR Board, and after five years the proceeds from any sale of former SFTS assets may be used as determined in the discretion of that board, who are fiduciaries for the University of Redlands and not for the former SFTS. In short, COTE is concerned that the distinguished legacy of the former SFTS could disappear after five years.\u201d. The co-moderators of the 224th General Assembly appointed a mediator, and after a year of negotiation, COTE, SFTS, and the University of Redlands agreed to a covenant \"reaffirming SFTS as a Presbyterian theological seminary related to the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)\". COTE presented the covenant to the 225th General Assembly of the PCUSA in July 2022, and the Assembly, upon COTE's recommendation, approved the covenant without controversy."

The parish Church of St Mary is 14th century. The most significant building in the village is Bunny Hall, probably built in the 1570s and occupied by the Parkyns family for three hundred years. Sir Thomas Parkyns, 2nd Baronet (1662\u20131741), known as the Wrestling Baronet, built what is now the north wing to his own design circa 1723\u201325. He also built the school and almshouses. Thomas Parkyns was a devotee of wrestling and organised an annual wrestling match in Bunny Park (prize a gold-laced hat). These matches continued until 1810. His book on the subject The Inn-Play: or, the Cornish Hugg-Wrestler was published in 1713 and reprinted many times.The following is an excerpt from a description of Bunny as published in 1813:\nBunny, a straggling village on the high road, containing about sixty houses, and which seems to have been indebted principally for its origin to the ancient seat of Bunny Park Hall, once the property of the family of Parkyns, and now of their descendant Lord Rancliffe. This family have indeed been great benefactors factors to the village, as it contains a good school house and hospital, the former being close to the church yard gate and erected in 1700 for the poor children of Bunny and Bradmore; and the latter having four rooms for four poor widows, and endowed by Dame Anne Parkyns."

Though the account that the castle had been completed in 1619 is contradicted by a later Survey (in 1622) of the Escheated Counties of Ulster that reads; Sir John Stuart, assignee of the Duke of Lennox \u2018has built a castle of lime and stone on the banks of the River Foyle 50\u2019 x 25\u2019 x 3\u00bd stories, slated, with 4 flankers at the top thereof. And an iron door portcullis wise; the principal timber and joists of the floor being oak are laid but not boarded or the partitions made, the iron grates for the windows being within the castle ready to be set up\u2019. There is a wonderful pencil drawing showing the castle at that time available here.\nKing James visited here on his way to the siege of Derry in 1689. From here he sent a letter proposing surrender, it was rejected.\nThe castle later became the property of The Hon. Elizabeth Hamilton whose eldest son, James, Earl of Abercorn, and Viscount Strabane erected a plaque in her memory in 1704.\nThe castle is now in ruins with only a small proportion of it left standing."

The city is the capital of the district of Gotha and was also a residence of the Ernestine Wettins from 1640 until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha originating here spawned many European rulers, including the royal houses of the United Kingdom, Belgium, Portugal (until 1910) and Bulgaria (until 1946).\nIn the Middle Ages, Gotha was a rich trading town on the trade route Via Regia and between 1650 and 1850, Gotha saw a cultural heyday as a centre of sciences and arts, fostered by the dukes of Saxe-Gotha. The first duke, Ernest the Pious, was famous for his wise rule. In the 18th century, the Almanach de Gotha was first published in the city. The publisher Justus Perthes  and the encyclopedist Joseph Meyer made Gotha a leading centre of German publishing around 1800. In the early 19th century, Gotha was a birthplace of the German insurance business. The SPD was founded in Gotha in 1875 by merging two predecessors. In that period Gotha became an industrial centre, with companies such as the Gothaer Waggonfabrik, a producer of trams and later aeroplanes.\nThe main sights of Gotha are the early-modern Friedenstein Castle, one of the largest Renaissance Baroque castles in Germany, the medieval city centre and the Gr\u00fcnderzeit buildings of 19th-century commercial boom.\nGotha lies in the southern part of the Thuringian Basin in a flat and agricultural landscape."

There was half a hide of land and land for four ploughs. There were three and a half ploughs, two villeins and six smallholders. The value of the manor was 15 shillings. In 1193 the manor was described as \u2033this desirable manor...\u2033 and the property of Walter Reynell who was castellan of Launceston Castle. Trebarth passed from the Reynells to the Carews and then to the Spoures. Henrie Spoure (died 1603) was one of the owners and in circa 1700 when Edmond Spoure (married to Mary n\u00e9e Rodd) died, the estate passed to his daughter Mary. She married Renatus Bellott of Bochym and they had one son, who died at the age of 8 in 1712. Mary outlived her husband and married Charles Grylls of Court and, was widowed a second time. Mary than met Captain Francis Rodd (1683 \u2013 August 1736), her cousin. In a relationship (but not married, despite rumours) the childless Mary died, leaving Trebartha to her cousin, who was the first Rodd to own Trebartha.In 1730 Francis Rodd married Allice, daughter of William Sandford of Exeter. Edward Rodd (1768 \u2013 1842) succeeded to Trebartha Hall in 1836 and in 1870 the house was in the residence of Francis Rodd (his son). It was demolished in 1949. In summary, Trebartha was in the possession of the Trebartha family from the 12th to the 15th-century; from the late 15th-century to 1730 it was held by the Spoure family and from 1730 to 1940 by the Rodd family.\nThe bird collection of Edward Hearle Rodd which contained at least forty-five cases with 270 specimens, mostly from Cornwall, passed to his nephew Francis R Rodd and all were lost when Trebartha was destroyed by fire in 1949.Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded a Cornish cross in the grounds of Trebartha Hall; it had been found built into the gable of a nearby cottage."

Originally, the freeway was supposed to end in Johnston, Rhode Island, at the I-95/I-195 connector (now the Route 6-10 Connector). The freeway was built to Bolton where it abruptly ends at the intersection with US 6 and US 44. A 5.7-mile (9.2 km) segment from Columbia to Windham was also built, forming the present-day US 6 bypass around Willimantic, and would have connected to the Connecticut Turnpike at what is now I-395 exit 35, following the last few miles of the turnpike into Rhode Island.\nCrossing into Rhode Island, the proposed I-84 freeway was to parallel US 6 to I-295, where it would have tied into the existing US 6/Rhode Island Route 10 freeway. In 1982, Rhode Island canceled their plans because of community backlash and possible impacts to the Scituate Reservoir. In 1986, Connecticut canceled their plans and changed I-86 back to I-84 and I-84 was renumbered I-384. Even after cancelling I-84, various proposals were made to complete the highway between Bolton and the Willimantic bypass or between the bypass and I-395."

The corresponding stretch of US 6 is known as \"Suicide 6\" because of sharp turns and intersections had been the site of numerous fatal accidents and was the main reason supporting construction of the bypass. It is unlikely the 11-mile (18 km) freeway between I-384 and the Windham Bypass will ever be built because of irresolvable disagreements over the routing of the freeway: state and local officials prefer more northerly alignment that minimizes disruption to developed areas along US 6, while federal officials insist on a more southerly alignment that minimizes environmental impacts to the Hop River ecosystem. After studying more than 200 potential alignments with no agreement among stakeholders, the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) abandoned further study of the US 6 freeway in 2005 and instead focused on completing safety upgrades on the existing US 6 corridor between Bolton and Willimantic to reduce congestion and accidents.A proposed extension of the CTfastrak bus rapid transit line would run in the HOV lanes in I-84 and I-384."

Barwon derives from the Wathaurong word Barrwang or Baarwon meaning magpie. The river and upstream lakes (Lake Connewarre and Reedy Lake) were frequented by Aboriginal hunters and fishermen, including the escaped convict, William Buckley, who lived with the Wathaurong for 32 years.When European settlers arrived in Port Phillip in June 1835, a camp was established at Indented Head. Port Phillip Association surveyor, John Helder Wedge, explored the Bellarine Peninsula, including the Barwon and its lakes, in August 1835.\nIt is unknown when colonists first took up land at Barwon Heads but, by the 1870s, a township was formed, with a Post Office opening in the area on 15 December 1889 (renamed Connewarre East in 1890 when a new Barwon Heads PO opened in the township).Fishing was the mainstay of the town in its early years. In the 1920s and 1930s, the town became a popular holiday resort, and a number of the wealthier families of Melbourne and the Western District built houses here. The summer period still sees a large influx of holidaymakers to the town.\nIn 1959, the closing scenes of the film On the Beach, based on a Nevil Shute novel about the end of the world, were filmed in the town.\nThe Barwon Heads Golf Club clubhouse, located on Golf Links Road and dating from 1923 to 1924, is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.The former Barwon Heads Bridge was also listed on the Register, but it was demolished in 2009 after being declared irreparable. A new bridge was constructed, which used components and design elements of the original bridge. A separate footbridge was built parallel to it."

An independent panel was appointed by the then Minister for Planning, Rob Hulls, to decide on a bridge location. Evidence was presented for and against the Geelong Road site and the existing site, with the conclusion that the Geelong Road alignment was unsuitable for environmental, social, economic reasons.\nOn 16 March 2007, it was announced that the current bridge would be improved and there were no plans to build a second bridge upstream. In 2010, a new Barwon Heads road bridge was constructed on the alignment of the existing one, making use of its components and design elements. A parallel pedestrian bridge was also built."

This has resulted in a very substantial increase in property and land values, making the town an ideal location for property developers. Since then, the area has experienced a boom in tourist numbers during the summer months.\nNearby Thirteenth Beach is a popular surfing location, the beach is named for its proximity to the 13th hole of the golf course. The town was subject to flooding, including a flood that lasted some weeks in 1952, until the construction of levee banks in the 1950s.\nThe artist Jan Mitchell erected her first bollard sculptures in Barwon Heads. Visitors to the area will encounter the colourful soldier and parrot bollards which designate a route for the local children from the primary school, through the streets to the bike path, park and playground.

It was named for French explorer Pierre-Charles Le Sueur, who visited the area in 1700.The settlement of Le Sueur (actually two competing settlements, Le Sueur and Le Sueur City) had sprung up on the east bank of the Minnesota River, both being platted in 1852. The legislature named the combined area as the first county seat. However, its remoteness from most of the county meant hardship for most of the area's residents since the county was covered with dense hardwood forest and existing roads were impassable when wet.\nSeveral efforts were made to acquire a more central location. In the early 1870s, Cleveland (established in 1857, inland from the river in the SW part of the county) held a referendum to become the county seat. The referendum passed, but was challenged due to voting irregularities. In 1875 another referendum made Cleveland the county seat (1875-1876). In 1876, another referendum approved moving the seat to the newly created town of Le Sueur Center; the seat was promptly moved there. In the 1870s, businessmen from Waterville gained ownership of a quarter-section of land near the county's center, cleared the timber, and platted the city of Le Sueur Center (1876). The seat was moved there after a county referendum approved it. The county seat has remained in Le Sueur Center (renamed Le Center in 1930) since 1876.\n\nThe first railroad entered the county in 1867. This began the era of greater access and mobility. The first purpose-built courthouse in Le Sueur Center was constructed in 1896\u20137. It has been extensively remodeled and enlarged two times since."

In 1138, the L\u00fctzel Abbey sent settlers to Frienisberg to found a new abbey.  The new abbey remained small and struggled until the first half of the 13th century, when a number of donations allowed it to expand.  In 1233 it owned land in Frienisberg, Allenwil, Ried, Tedlingen, Niederwiler, Werd, G\u00e4serz bei Ins and Montils bei Nugerol.  At its peak, about 300 farmers worked 5,000 Juchart (a measurement of acreage related to the Roman Jugerum, 1 Juchart was .36 hectares [0.89 acres] for a total of 1,800 hectares [4,400 acres]) in 45 villages west of Bern.  It also owned vineyards on the shores of Lake Biel and had 282 men working on the vines.  Finally it controlled the patronage and the right to appoint parish priests in Rapperswil, Seedorf, Nieder-Lyss, Bargen, Sch\u00fcpfen and Grossaffoltern.Initially, the majority of the Abbey's income came from rents or produce from its farms and estates.  Starting in the middle of the 13th century the economy of the monastery began to slowly change.  It moved away from land rents and now began to survive on tithes and offerings.  In the second half of the 13th century, the abbey founded the nunneries of Fraubrunnen, Steinen and Tedlingen.In 1386, the Abbey tied itself closely to Bern, when it accepted Bernese citizenship for its monks and farmers.  This close connection with Bern led to the Abbey's downfall.  When Bern embraced the Protestant Reformation, many Bernese monasteries, including Frienisberg, were secularized.  The last abbot, Urs Hirsinger, fled to Hauterive in the Canton of Fribourg rather than remain in Bern.  In 1534, the abbey church was demolished.  The former convent building was converted into a hospital in 1533 and it housed the local Bernese bailiff until 1798.  In 1834 it was converted into a home for the deaf-mute.  In 1889 it was converted into a nursing home, a role that it still fills today.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Shortly after their marriage in 1873, Samuel Barnett and his wife, Henrietta, moved to the Whitechapel district of the East End of London. Barnett was vicar of St Jude's church, where he saw poverty at first hand. Late-Victorian Whitechapel was known for its overcrowded living spaces and high criminal activity. In the area of Whitechapel alone, the mortality rate for children under the age of five was around 60% mostly due to the tight living conditions. Charles Booth, another social reformer, mapped London according to eight different social classes, finding that around 70% of people living in the East End were in the lowest three classes.\nWhitechapel was also a place where many different immigrants settled. The Great Famine of Ireland in the 19th century led to many Irish settling in Whitechapel. Also, many Jewish immigrants settled in Whitechapel after fleeing from persecution in Western Europe at the time.The Barnetts used their roles in the parish to improve the Whitechapel area. They built a church library, introduced art exhibits, brought university lecturers in, and took their parishioners on excursions to the homes of the wealthy and to universities. The Barnetts also tried to encourage officials to improve sanitation and housing and to build more playgrounds and washhouses. However, the attempts the Barnetts made with the parish had little effect on the East End community as a whole. The parish did not reach everyone that lived in the East End. Many of the people did not involve themselves with the established church. In an effort to improve the wellbeing of the community, Barnett had the idea of sharing knowledge and culture. His proposal was to have university students come as volunteers to share their knowledge: the students would be able to help the poor, and at the same time witness poverty at first hand, and potentially develop solutions for it.In 1883, Barnett gave a lecture at St John's College, Oxford to gain support for his idea. Barnett was able to gather enough support and a committee called the \"University Settlement of East London\" was set up by Oxford. With these ideas and the support of universities, Barnett founded Toynbee Hall, the first settlement house in the world. Named after another social reformer, Arnold Toynbee, Toynbee Hall first opened its doors on Christmas Eve in 1884. Samuel Barnett was named as the first warden of the hall and Oxford and Cambridge university students came to work at the hall.By 1910 more settlement houses were founded in England in the areas of Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Birmingham, Liverpool, and elsewhere in London; as well as in Holland, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, and the United States. In 1911 the leaders of the social settlement movement founded the National Federation of Settlements. One of the best known settlement houses that was inspired after a visit to Toynbee Hall is Hull House in Chicago, founded by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr in 1889.Over time Toynbee Hall implemented many different educational community programmes. At its opening, Toynbee Hall introduced University Extension Society lectures. These lectures were taught by university professors. At the programme's peak, in the 1890s, classes were taught in over 134 topics including; literature, zoology, ethics, philosophy, etc.:\u200a117\u201319\u200a In order to further promote education, 36 societies or clubs were created in different areas, such as, music, art, history, and science. One of these societies was founded in 1889 and was called the \"Toynbee Travellers\". This group was created after a group of Toynbee Hall residents travelled to Belgium in 1887. Toynbee Hall also began hosting Smoking Room Debates in which community members and invited speakers would come to debate issues of the day. This tradition continued for over twenty years. In 1899, the Poor Man's Lawyer service was introduced. This programme gives free legal services to those who can not afford it, and continues to the present day."

They came, according to Samuel Barnett, \"to learn, as much as to teach, to receive as much as to give\".:\u200a377\u200a As at most settlement houses, its social workers\u2014students from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, among others\u2014resided at Toynbee Hall and sought thereby to get to know their neighbors and their needs on a more intimate, personal level.Toynbee Hall rejected the concept of a community centre as a location for Christian proselytising\u2014as seen in the efforts of the Salvation Army. This principle is reflected in the decision to name it after the social reformer, Arnold Toynbee, who had died in 1883, aged 30. As Henrietta Barnett explained, the name would be \"free from every possible savor of a mission.\"From the beginning, it was non-sectarian and welcomed people of all faiths, despite having been founded by a Church of England cleric. It saw its purpose as more educational than charitable, in a missionary sense. Gertrude Himmelfarb lists some of the activities offered by Toynbee Hall in a typical month: \"evening classes on arithmetic, writing, drawing, citizenship, chemistry, nursing, and music (...); afternoon classes for girls on dressmaking, writing and composition, geography, bookkeeping, needlework, hygiene, reading and recitation, French, singing, cooking, and swimming; and evening sessions devoted to the discussion of legal principles and current social issues\".:\u200a378\u200aBy 1900 there were over 100 settlements in the United States and across the UK, and in 1911 the leaders of the social settlement movement founded the National Federation of Settlements."

The highway runs for 46.28 miles (74.48 km) across mostly rural areas from an intersection with NY 78 and NY 98 in the Wyoming County town of Java to a junction with NY 31 near the city of Lockport in Niagara County. It connects to several of the region's major east\u2013west roads, including U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90 or I-90). In southwestern Genesee County, the route takes on added importance as it provides the most direct route between the Thruway and Darien Lake, Western New York's largest amusement park.\nThe route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the portion of its modern routing north of US 20A. Over the next 30 years, NY 77 was truncated and extended several times, moving the south end of the route to various locations in Wyoming and Genesee counties.

Here, NY 78 heads east\u2013west through the junction while NY 98 enters the intersection from the south and turns to follow NY 78 east toward an area known as Five Corners. NY 77, meanwhile, continues due north on the path set by NY 98 south of this point. The highway gradually descends through the open fields of Wyoming County, loosely paralleling the Arcade and Attica Railroad for 4 miles (6 km) to the railroad's end outside of North Java. Past this point, NY 77 heads into the town of Sheldon, where it crosses US 20A near the northern town line. In the adjacent town of Bennington, the route serves the small hamlet of the same name, situated around NY 77's junction with NY 354.North of Bennington hamlet, the highway traverses some swampy areas on its way into Genesee County, where it crosses the Norfolk Southern Railway's Southern Tier Line at a grade crossing just south of the Darien hamlet of Darien Center. In the small community, located southeast of Darien Lakes State Park, NY 77 intersects the cross-state US 20. Not far to the north of Darien Center is Darien Lake, a sprawling amusement park located on the east side of the highway. The road, however, remains a two-lane highway as it continues north to the town of Pembroke and the village of Corfu, where it intersects NY 33. NY 77 crosses another major east\u2013west route, NY 5, at a junction 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Corfu known locally as Brick House Corners.\nJust beyond that junction, the truck stops and toll plaza associated with exit 48A of the New York State Thruway (I-90) come into view as the road dips slightly in elevation. After connecting to the Thruway's toll plaza, the highway makes its first major bend, turning northeast to pass over the Thruway. Past the Thruway, it once again continues in a more northerly fashion to the hamlet of Indian Falls, a community located on the northern bank of the Tonawanda Creek. NY 77 crosses the creek here, and the falls that give the hamlet its name are visible from the road. North of the falls, the surrounding land becomes mostly fields once again as the route resumes a due north alignment into the town of Alabama. At the small hamlet of Basom, NY 77 intersects Bloomingdale Road, a local road serving the nearby Tonawanda Indian Reservation that was once part of NY 267.Not far from Basom, NY 63 comes in from the east and turns north onto NY 77, starting the only concurrency along the latter route. This ends 1.5 miles (2.4 km) further north in the hamlet of Alabama, where NY 77 turns to the west as NY 63 takes over the northbound route. The portion of NY 77 from NY 63 to the Niagara County line is maintained by Genesee County as part of CR 12, which continues east of NY 63 along Lewiston, Lockport and North Byron Roads to CR 7 northeast of the village of Elba. This section of NY 77 is the only part that is not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).\nWest of NY 63, NY 77 follows Lewiston Road northwest along the southwestern edge of Oak Orchard Swamp and the Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge. As it heads into Niagara County, NY 77 continues to trend slightly northward, running along the northern fringe of the Tonawanda Wildlife Management Area. About 6 miles (10 km) northwest of the county line is the hamlet of McNalls, which served as the southern terminus of the 1930s incarnation of NY 359. The route continues on to the eastern suburbs of the city of Lockport, where NY 77 ends at an intersection with NY 31 near the community of Nottingham Estates."

On March 1, 1921, the spur became part of an extended Route 20. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route 20 west of Rochester was designated as part of NY 3.

The settlement is located on County Route 526 between Allentown and Imlaystown where it intersects the former Pemberton and Hightstown Railroad. The site was the location of the Newell post office established in 1883 (removed in 1923). The area was originally known as Imlaystown Station as it was the closest spot to the eponymous town along the railroad. In 1887, the area was renamed to Nelsonville for the local postmaster, Charles Nelson. Other industries in the area at the time included a wagon shop and a cider mill. Today, several agricultural and light industries surround the settlement in addition to some single-family homes. The right-of-way of the former railroad is being reconstructed as the Union Transportation Trail.\n\n\n== References =="

An eye-witness described the event:\n\nAt six o'-clock on the morning of the 23rd I was standing with other boys by the gate near the cattle pound when I saw, rushing up the valley, the tidal wave, driven by a hurricane and bearing upon its crest a whole haystack and other debris from the fields below. We ran for our lives to Chickerell, and when we returned found that five houses had been swept away and the church was in ruins.\nA new church, Holy Trinity, was built a short distance inland and only the chancel of the old one stands today.J.

It consisted of three separate treaties between England and each of its opponents in the Second Anglo-Dutch War: the Dutch Republic, France, and Denmark\u2013Norway. It also included a separate Anglo-Dutch commercial agreement. \nNegotiations had been in progress since late 1666 but were slow, as both sides tried to improve their positions. This changed after the French invasion of the Spanish Netherlands in late May, which the Dutch viewed as a more serious threat. War-weariness in England was increased by the June Raid on the Medway. Both factors led to a rapid agreement of terms. \nPrior to 1667, the Anglo-Dutch relationship had been dominated by commercial conflict, which the treaty did not end entirely. However, tensions decreased markedly and cleared the way for the 1668 Triple Alliance between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden. With the brief anomaly of the 1672 to 1674 Third Anglo-Dutch War, the treaty marked the beginning of an alliance between the English and the Dutch that would last for a century."

        "content": "The Second Anglo-Dutch War was caused by commercial tensions, heightened by Charles II, who saw trade as a way to reduce his financial dependence on Parliament. In 1660, he and his brother James founded the Royal African Company (RAC), challenging the Dutch in West Africa. Investors included senior politicians such as George Carteret, Shaftesbury and Arlington, creating a strong link between the RAC and government policy.Huge profits from Asian spices led to conflict even in times of peace, as the Dutch East India Company, or VOC, first created, then enforced, their monopoly over production and trade. By 1663, indigenous and European competitors like the Portuguese had been eliminated, leaving only nutmeg plantations on Run. These had been established by the British East India Company in 1616, before being evicted by the VOC in 1620; when the English re-occupied Run in late 1664, the Dutch expelled them again, this time destroying the plantations.There was a similar struggle over the Atlantic trade between the Dutch West-Indische Compagnie, or WIC, and competitors from Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Portugal and England. Sugar plantations in the Americas were cultivated by slaves from Africa, fed by colonies in North America, leading to conflict in all three regions. In August 1664, the English occupied New Netherland, later renamed New York; when another attack captured WIC slave trade posts in modern Ghana, the Dutch sent a fleet to recapture them. The result was to bankrupt the RAC, whose investors saw war as the best way to recoup their losses.Despite the Franco-Dutch treaty of April 1662, Louis XIV initially remained neutral, as French and Dutch economic interests increasingly diverged over the Spanish Netherlands. The 1648 Peace of M\u00fcnster permanently closed the Scheldt estuary and the port of Antwerp, which did not recover economically until the 19th century. The combination gave Amsterdam effective control of trade in North-West Europe. Louis considered the Spanish Netherlands his by right of marriage to Maria Theresa of Spain but hoped to acquire them peacefully. Negotiations with the Dutch continually broke down over his desire to re-open Antwerp as an export route for French goods. By 1663, he concluded they would never make concessions voluntarily and began planning a military intervention.\nIn early 1665, England signed an alliance with Sweden against the Dutch, who suffered a serious defeat at Lowestoft in June, followed by an invasion from M\u00fcnster. Louis responded by activating the 1662 treaty, calculating this would make it harder for the Dutch to oppose his occupation of the Spanish Netherlands. He also paid Sweden to remain neutral, while influencing Denmark\u2013Norway to join the war. Danish assistance saved the Dutch merchant fleet at the Battle of V\u00e5gen in August, although this turned out to have been the result of miscommunication. Frederick III of Denmark had secretly agreed to help the English capture the fleet in return for a share of the profits, but his instructions arrived too late.By late 1666, Charles was short of money, largely due to his refusal to recall Parliament, while English trade had been badly affected by the war and domestic disasters. In contrast, the Dutch economy had largely recovered from its post-1665 contraction, while public debt was lower in 1667 than 1652; however, naval warfare was enormously expensive and financing it a challenge even for the Amsterdam markets. Both sides wanted peace, since the Dutch had little to gain from continuing the war and faced external challenges from competitors. Denmark resented concessions imposed at Christianopel in 1647, while the WIC's confiscation of Danish ships was an ongoing source of dispute; in early 1667, they joined Sweden and France in imposing tariffs on Dutch goods, impacting the Baltic grain trade.In October 1666, Charles opened discussions with the States-General of the Netherlands, under the pretext of arrangements to return the body of Vice-Admiral William Berkeley, killed in the Four Days' Battle. He invited the Dutch to negotiations in London and withdrew previous demands for the appointment of his nephew William of Orange as stadtholder, payment of damages, the return of Run and a trade deal on India. The States-General refused to attend peace talks without France; on territorial claims, they offered to continue the present situation, or revert to the position before the war, an option clearly unacceptable to the English.It is questionable how sincere this offer from Charles actually was, since his envoy in Paris, the Earl of St Albans, was simultaneously holding secret talks on an Anglo-French alliance. Louis agreed to ensure the Dutch complied with English demands, in exchange for a free hand in the Spanish Netherlands; by April 1667, diplomats in The Hague were predicting a deal was imminent. When talks eventually began, the English delegation felt their position was extremely strong."

        "content": "Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt and the States of Holland rejected English proposals to negotiate in The Hague, a town dominated by the Orangist opposition. They were supported by Louis, who viewed the Orangists as English agents. Angered by the delay, the States of Zeeland, Gelderland, Groningen, Overijssel and Friesland threatened to stop paying for a war 'continued only by Holland's obstinacy.'The parties eventually settled on Breda, but French military preparations led the Orangists to accuse De Witt of deliberately stalling to allow Louis a free hand in the Spanish Netherlands. This put De Witt under pressure to reach agreement, which increased after France and Portugal agreed an anti-Spanish alliance in March.The role of mediator in peace talks provided prestige and the opportunity to build relationships; since Louis and Leopold both wanted the position, they compromised by using Swedish diplomats. Key players in the vital Baltic trade in grain, iron and shipping supplies, the Swedes hoped to remove commercial concessions imposed by the Republic in the 1656 Treaty of Elbing and end its alliance with Denmark. G\u00f6ran Fleming was based at Breda, with Peter Coyet in The Hague; after Coyet died on 8 June, he was replaced by Count Dohna, who was instructed to negotiate a Swedish-English-French alliance if talks at Breda failed.The States General appointed eight delegates but only those from Holland, Zeeland and Friesland were actually present. Two of the three were Orangists, Zeelandic Pensionary Pieter de Huybert and Friesland's van Jongestall; the delegate from Holland, Van Beverningh, was a member of De Witt's States Party. The English lead negotiators were Denzil Holles,  Ambassador to France, and Henry Coventry, Ambassador to Sweden. \n\nOn 24 May, Louis launched the War of Devolution, French troops quickly occupying much of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comt\u00e9. To focus on this, Spain needed to end the long-running Portuguese Restoration War. On 27 May, the Anglo-Spanish Treaty of Madrid formally concluded the 1654 to 1660 war and in return for commercial concessions, England agreed to mediate with Portugal.The threat to the Dutch economy presented by French expansion made ending the Anglo-Dutch War a matter of urgency. Backed by assurances from Louis that he would force the Dutch to agree concessions, the English increased their demands and Van Beverningh told De Witt a major military victory was needed to improve their bargaining position. An opportunity was provided by Charles, who decommissioned most of the Royal Navy in late 1666 as a cost-saving measure. The Dutch took full advantage in the June 1667 Medway Raid; although the action itself had limited strategic impact, it was a humiliation Charles never forgot.Holles and Coventry initially assumed this would extend negotiations, but the need to create an alliance against France meant Spain threatened to withhold implementation of the Madrid treaty, supported by Leopold. Combined with economic losses caused by the war and the Great Fire of London, Clarendon instructed Holles to agree terms \"to calm people's minds\" and \"free the king from a burden...he is finding hard to bear\"."

        "content": "Article 1 of the treaty stipulated a limited military alliance, obliging fleets or single ships sailing on the same course to defend each other against a third party. Article 3 established the principle of uti possidetis, or \"what you have, you hold\", with an effective date of 20 May. The Dutch kept Surinam, now part of modern Suriname, Fort Cormantin and Run while the English kept New Netherland, which was subsequently divided into the colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Delaware.Articles 4 to 8 applied the same principle to losses of goods or ships, including those that occurred before the war. No indemnities could be levied or punishments imposed, but all existing Letters of Marque were declared void. To allow time to communicate these instructions, Article 7 varied the date on which they would be enforced: 5 September for the English Channel and the North Sea, 5 October for the other European seas, 2 November for the African coast north of the Equator and 24 April 1668 for the rest of the world.Article 10 required all prisoners to be exchanged without ransom although the Dutch later demanded reimbursement of their living expenses, which the English viewed as the same thing. After their failed 1666 coup, many Orangists sought refuge in England, with English and Scots dissidents going the other way. In Articles 13 and 17, both sides undertook not to protect each other's rebels; in a secret annex, the Dutch undertook to extradite regicides who voted for the Execution of Charles I in 1649, although in practice these provisions were ignored.A separate treaty amended the Navigation Acts; goods transported along the Rhine or Scheldt to Amsterdam could be carried by Dutch ships to England without being subject to tariffs. England also accepted the principle of \"free ships make free goods\", which prevented the Royal Navy from intercepting Dutch ships during wars in which the Dutch were neutral. These terms were preliminary, with a definitive text signed on 17 February 1668.The Danish and French treaties followed the Anglo-Dutch version in waiving claims for restitution of losses. In addition, England returned the French possessions of Cayenne and Acadia, captured in 1667 and 1654 respectively, but the exact boundaries were not specified, and the handover was delayed until 1670. England regained Montserrat and Antigua, with the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts divided between both countries. After the treaties were signed on 31 July, they were sent to each country for ratification, a process which was completed by 24 August and followed by public celebrations in Breda."

        "content": "By exchanging New Netherland and Run, Breda removed two major areas of dispute, reducing Anglo-Dutch tensions overall and clearing the way for the 1668 Triple Alliance between the Republic, Sweden and England. The Alliance is often credited with forcing France to return most of their gains at Aix-la-Chapelle, whereas the terms had already been agreed by Louis and Leopold in January 1668. In the longer term, Breda was the point when the English and Dutch came to view France as a greater threat than each other; whilst Charles' preference for a French alliance led to the 1670 Secret Treaty of Dover, the long-term trend was against him. Support for re-asserting English naval power provided limited backing in the Third Anglo-Dutch War but ended once that had been achieved.The treaty disappointed Orangists by failing to restore the House of Orange or allow exiles home, as promised by Charles. When Zeeland and Friesland, in response to the French advance, proposed William be made Captain-General of the Dutch States Army, the States of Holland responded on 5 August with the Perpetual Edict. This abolished the position of Stadholder of Holland, while a second resolution agreed to oppose that any confederate Captain-General or Admiral-General would become stadtholder of another province. Since the army was viewed as an Orangist power base, spending on it was deliberately minimised; this had catastrophic effects in 1672.Breda was also a success for Sweden, who used their position as mediators to improve the Elbing provisions, break the Dutch-Danish agreement and join the Triple Alliance. The Spanish regained Franche-Comt\u00e9 and most of the Spanish Netherlands; more significantly, the Dutch now viewed them as a better neighbour than an ambitious France. Overall, the Dutch considered Breda and the creation of the Alliance a diplomatic triumph; the period immediately following is often considered the high point of the Dutch Golden Age."

        "content": "An organ was built in 1954 by Orgelbau Romanus Seifert & Sohn. In 1985 the instrument was expanded by Hugo Mayer Orgelbau; in 1995 three electronic bass stops were added. The Kantor was Gabriel Dessauer from 1981, the conductor of the 120-member Chor von St. Bonifatius, founded in 1862, the children's choir Kinderchor von St. Bonifatius, and the Schola for Gregorian chant. He was succeeded by Roman Twardy. The church choir sings at services, including regular orchestral masses of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert for Christmas and Easter. Every year, typically on 3 October, a choral concert is performed. Other annual features are choral and organ concerts organised around a theme, called Boni-Musikwochen, including concerts of organists such as Kent Tritle and Ignace Michiels, and the project choir Reger-Chor. On 7 November 2015, as part of the 21st festival Wiesbadener Bachwochen, the church presented a concert dedicated to French church music, Gabriel Faur\u00e9's Cantique de Jean Racine and Requiem and Olivier Latry's Salve Regina. A project choir of 150 singers performed, led by three conductors of the Diocese of Limburg, with soloists and members of the orchestra of the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden.Dessauer ended conducting the choir in 2019, succeeded by interim conductor Roman Twardy. His term as church musician ended with 2021. He was succeeded by Johannes Schr\u00f6der."

It was the first European-style urban park in Taiwan, placed on the grounds of the Governor-General's Office.\nIn 1930, Taiwan's Japanese authorities established a radio station at the site designed by Kuriyama Shunichi (\u6817\u5c71\u4fca\u4e00). The station initially housed the Taihoku Broadcasting Bureau, an arm of the Government-General Propaganda Bureau's Information Office. The following year, the Taiwan Broadcast Association was formed to handle island-wide broadcasts. The Taihoku Park radio station became the center of broadcast activity for the Association.\nIn 1935, it was one of the sites used for The Taiwan Exposition: In Commemoration of the First Forty Years of Colonial Rule.After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the park was subsequently renamed Taipei New Park by the government. They renamed the broadcasting agency the Taiwan Broadcasting Company. The station became the primary broadcast organ of the Kuomintang government and military.\nIn 1947, a group of protesters, angry over a brutal police action against Taiwanese civilians, took over the station and used it to broadcast accusations against the Kuomintang government. The action formed part of a chain of events now referred to as the February 28 Incident. A subsequent, more severe crackdown by the Nationalist government restored the station to Kuomintang control and ushered in  Taiwan's period of white terror. Two years later, the Kuomintang lost ground in the Chinese Civil War and its leaders retreated to Taiwan. Trying to establish themselves as China's true national government in exile, they renamed the bureau the Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC).\nThe Taipei City government took over operation of the radio station building when the BCC moved in 1972. City officials made it the site of the Taipei City Government Parks and Street Lights Office.As Taiwan entered its modern democracy period in the 1990s, President Lee Teng-hui offered an official apology in 1995 and invited free discussion of Taiwan's past. For the first time the February 28 Incident of 1947 was officially acknowledged and its significance openly debated. In 1996, the Taipei City Government designated the former radio station building a historical site. Two years later, the building was made the home of the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum and the park was rededicated as 228 Peace Memorial Park.The 228 Memorial Monument was designed by Taiwanese architect Cheng Tzu-tsai, who was convicted of attempted murder in 1971 following a 1970 assassination attempt on Chiang Ching-kuo. After serving his sentence, he was imprisoned for illegal entry to Taiwan in 1991 and filed his design entry from prison. The Monument is inscribed with an exhortation for peace and unity.\nMistrust between Taiwanese and Mainlanders, and the argument on whether Taiwan should declare independence or be united with China, have become hot issues with potentially worrisome implications. [...] the task of healing a serious trauma in a society must depend on the whole-hearted collaborative effort by all its people. [...] It is also hoped that these words will serve as a warning and a lesson to all Taiwanese compatriots. Henceforward, we must be one, no matter which communal group we belong; we must help each other with compassion and treat each other with sincerity; we must dissolve hatred and resentment, and bring about long lasting peace. May Heaven bless Taiwan and keep it evergreen.\nOn 25 November 2019, the museum was declared as a cultural asset by the Bureau of Cultural Heritage."

There was presumably a wooden Slavonic castle located on the site of the present-day Hartenfels castle.\nIn the 10th century it fell under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire, and a stone castle was built, around which the settlement congregated. A market is attested in 1119. The town was located on the important trade route, the Via Regia Lusatiae inferioris, between Leipzig and Frankfurt an der Oder that crossed the river Elbe at a ford east of Torgau.\nTorgau belonged to the duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg, which in 1356 was raised to be the Electorate of Saxony. After the last Ascanian duke died without issue in 1423, the Electorate passed to the Wettin dynasty, which took up its residence at Torgau.\nFollowing the Treaty of Leipzig partition of the Wettin inheritance on 26 August 1485, Torgau fell to the Ernestine line. Frederick III, Elector of Saxony and his successors had Hartenfels Castle at Torgau built by architect Conrad Pfl\u00fcger and his successor Konrad Krebs.\nThe Ernestine court resided mainly in Torgau and in Weimar. From 1525 onward, Torgau became the sole residence. Hartenfels Castle is the largest completely preserved castle of the early Renaissance in Germany. After the Battle of M\u00fchlberg in 1547, Torgau fell to the Albertine line.\nDuring the Reformation, the town council closed all cloisters in 1523. Citizens of Torgau destroyed paintings and statues of saints in the churches and stormed the Franciscan monastery.\nAfter Martin Luther had driven Andreas Karlstadt from Saxony in 1524, he enforced the expulsion of Karlstadt's followers from Torgau in 1529. Katharina von Bora, the widow of Luther, died in Torgau and is buried there in the Marienkirche. The court chapel, constructed in 1543-44 by Nikolaus Gromann, was consecrated by Luther on 5 October 1544; it is thus the second oldest newly constructed Protestant church in the world, after the court chapel of Neuburg Castle which was consecrated in 1543.\nThe Torgauer Artikel, a draft of the Augsburg Confession, was composed by Luther, Melanchthon, Bugenhagen and Jonas in the electoral superindenture in 1530 (Wintergr\u00fcn). The Lutheran Formula of Concord was written in Torgau in 1576.\nThe first German opera, Heinrich Sch\u00fctz's Dafne, was presented at the court in Torgau in 1627.\nIn the Battle of Torgau, fought on 3 November 1760, a Prussian army under the command of King Friedrich the Great defeated a larger Austrian army under the command of Field Marshal Leopold Josef Graf Daun, a major battle of the Seven Years' War. After the Congress of Vienna, it was passed to Prussia in 1815."

The border towards S\u00f8rlandet is less obvious.\nThe mountains reach a height of 2469 metres in the Jotunheimen mountain range, the highest point in the Nordic countries (excluding Greenland).

The dialects of the coastal areas (Telemark, Vestfold, Akershus, southern Buskerud, Oslo and \u00d8stfold) are more similar to the written language (Bokm\u00e5l); in fact, Urban East Norwegian can be said to be an unofficial standard pronunciation of Bokm\u00e5l.\nThe eastern forests of Finnskogen and Finnemarka were the home of a Finnish minority, that immigrated in the area in the 17th century.

The southernmost group of Norway's Sami population is to be found in the north-eastern corner, in Engerdal.\nThe culture of mountain valleys is preserved to a greater degree than the more urbanized metropolitan areas.  The area is distinguished with traditional architecture, like stave churches and lafteverk, folk music and food.  Some are concerned for the loss of local culture in the face of modernization. There are many tourist traps, which have a tendency of becoming Disneyland versions of the actual culture, especially in the ski resorts, which are transformed by people from the cities, with increased building of shops, hotels and vacation houses.\nIt is common to see moose warning signs missing from their posts, because of many tourists taking them home as a souvenir. This is of course illegal, and can result in a fine.\nThe coastal region is densely populated both by Norwegian and European standards. This region was the early industrialized.  Traditionally the biggest export was timber and shipping, now employment in the industrial sector is in decline and most people are working in service-oriented companies. The coastal area is varied, from the metropolitan Oslo to the more quiet and idyllic old maritime city of Dr\u00f8bak, and the oldest city in Norway, T\u00f8nsberg\nThere is also some museum railway lines, for example the Kr\u00f8der Line, where one can ride heritage steam and diesel trains on old twisty railway tracks.\nOslo, the capital of Norway, has attracted people from all over Norway. Most of the country's immigrants settle in the region as well. In addition to numerous Christian churches, there are many mosques, Hindu shrines, Sikh temples, and Buddhist temples, giving Oslo a cosmopolitan feel.\n\n\n== References =="

Immediately after crossing the railroad tracks, the route turns northeast onto Jacksonville Road and runs through industrial areas with some homes and businesses.PA 332 intersects East County Line Road and it enters Warminster Township in Bucks County, gaining a center left-turn lane. The road passes between the Warminster station that serves as the terminus of SEPTA's Warminster Line to the west and the neighborhood of Warminster Heights to the east. The route loses the center turn lane before it widens to four lanes and crosses PA 132 near businesses as it continues near industrial parks. The road narrows back to two lanes past the Johnsville Boulevard intersection and enters the borough of Ivyland, heading past homes. The route becomes the border between Ivyland to the northwest and Warminster Township to the southeast prior to crossing Bristol Road into Northampton Township. PA 332 continues between industrial areas to the northwest and residential areas to the southeast, reaching an intersection with Almshouse Road in the community of Jacksonville.\nPA 332 turns southeast onto Almshouse Road and runs through a mix of farm fields and residences. Past the Hatboro Road intersection, the road curves to the east and gains a center left-turn lane, heading into the community of Richboro. In Richboro, the route passes through business areas and intersects PA 232. Upon crossing PA 232, PA 332 changes its name to Newtown Richboro Road and continues past more homes as a two-lane road. The road forms the southern boundary of Tyler State Park, running between areas of fields and woods in the park to the north and residential subdivisions to the south and intersecting Holland Road. The route curves northeast and then east before crossing the Neshaminy Creek into Newtown Township, where the name changes to Richboro Road. In this area, the road briefly widens into a divided highway before it comes to an intersection with PA 413/PA 532 at the Newtown Bypass, a road that provides a bypass of the borough of Newtown.At this point, PA 332 turns south onto the four-lane divided Newtown Bypass, forming a concurrency with PA 413/PA 532. The road heads through wooded areas with nearby residential development, with PA 532 splitting southwest onto Buck Road toward Holland. PA 332/PA 413 curve east, passing over Newtown Creek and coming to a bridge over Freedom Drive and the abandoned Fox Chase/Newtown railroad line. The road enters Middletown Township before PA 413 splits from the bypass by turning south onto Newtown Langhorne Road toward the borough of Langhorne. PA 332 continues east near residential and commercial development as it crosses back into Newtown Township and runs a short distance to the north of the border between Newtown Township and Middletown Township, passing north of a shopping center that is served by an eastbound ramp. The road curves to the northeast at the Penns Trail/Woodbourne Road junction before turning east past the intersection with Newtown Yardley Road.Upon intersecting Lindenhurst Road/Campus Drive north of the Newtown Campus of Holy Family University, the route enters Lower Makefield Township and becomes Newtown Yardley Road. The road passes through farmland before heading north of an office park and reaching a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-295. Following this interchange, PA 332 becomes a two-lane undivided road and intersects Mirror Lake Road before it enters residential areas and crosses Buck Creek. The route reaches a junction with Yardley Langhorne Road and turns northeast onto Afton Avenue. PA 332 enters the borough of Yardley, where it is known as West Afton Avenue. The road heads into the downtown area and crosses Main Street, where the road name changes to East Afton Avenue, and the Delaware Canal.

Boston EMS Ambulance Station 18 is located on Dana Avenue. Hyde Park also has a branch of the Boston Public Library.\nThe George Wright Golf Course, named for Baseball Hall of Fame and Boston Red Stockings shortstop George Wright, is in Hyde Park and Roslindale. It is a Donald Ross\u2013designed course and is considered one of his finest designs.\nHyde Park has taken the motto \"A Small Town in the City\" because of its suburban feel. The area was established in the 1660s and grew into a hub of paper and cotton manufacturing in the eighteenth century. The extension of rail lines from Boston in the 1850s spurred the area's residential development. The Readville section of Hyde Park contained a large manufacturing base housing the massive operations of the B. F. Sturtevant Company and the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Locomotive and Car Shops.\nHyde Park and some of its residents have been important part of societal change in the United States.

        "content": "In 1845, retired businessman Henry Grew took his family on vacation to an area south of the City of Boston, in what was then the western section of Dorchester, and came to a spot in the Neponset River valley with an unexpectedly pleasant view of the nearby Blue Hills.  He purchased several hundred acres of land there (which later became known as \"Grew's Woods\", partially preserved today as the Stony Brook Reservation and the George Wright Golf Course) and moved to the area in 1847. (Grew later served as chairman of the new Town of Hyde Park's first board of selectmen and was one of its most prominent citizens.)  During the next few years, a group called the Hyde Park Land Company bought about 200 acres of land in the area and began building houses around a small and unofficial passenger stop on the Boston and Providence Railroad that had developed at Kenny's Bridge, located on the road from Dedham to Milton Lower Mills (the road was River Street, and the station today is Hyde Park Station). At that time, the closest actual station was in the manufacturing district of Readville (formerly Low Plains) in Dedham.\nAlpheus Perley Blake is considered the founder of Hyde Park. He was the organizer in 1856 of the Fairmount Land Company and the Twenty Associates, which developed the Fairmount Hill on the western side of Brush Hill Road in Milton. This led to the establishment of a bridge over the Neponset River and a new station on the New York and New England Railroad, which is today's Fairmount Station.  In addition to Blake, The Twenty Associates included William E. Abbot, Amos Angell, Ira L. Benton, Enoch Blake, John Newton Brown, George W. Currier, Hypolitus Fisk, John C. French, David Higgins, John S. Hobbs, Samuel Salmon Mooney, William Nightingale, J. Wentworth Payson, Dwight B. Rich, Alphonso Robinson, William H. Seavey, Daniel Warren, and John Williams.  Within a few years, the two land companies had merged and growth in the area accelerated.  By 1867, the settlements had grown to the point where there were 6 railroad stations in the area. A formal petition was made to the General Court of the Commonwealth and, after settling land and boundary disputes with Dedham and Milton, the Town of Hyde Park was incorporated on April 22, 1868, in Norfolk County from the settled land in Dorchester (Grew's Woods and the Hyde Park Land Company development), Milton (Fairmount) and Dedham (Readville).  It remained a part of Norfolk County until 1912, when the town voted in favor of annexation to the City of Boston in Suffolk County.\nThe 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, one of the first official African-American units in the United States Army and which was commanded by Col. Robert G. Shaw and served during the Civil War, was assembled and trained at Camp Meigs in Readville.\nIn the 1960s, Hyde Park threatened to secede from Boston over plans to build a Southwest Expressway (Interstate 95) through the town along the route of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, which would bifurcate the neighborhood and displace many residents, as had happened in Roxbury and Jamaica Plain.  Hyde Park has also faced other challenges along with its fellow Boston neighborhoods, such as the busing crisis of the 1970s.\nHyde Park has had an active industrial history.  For over 100 years, it was the main base of the Westinghouse Sturtevant Corporation.  The Readville area was home to the Stop & Shop warehouse, until it was moved to Assonet in the early 2000s.\nHyde Park is home to many churches, most notably the Most Precious Blood, Saint Adalbert's and Saint Anne's Roman Catholic churches, and the Episcopal Parish of Christ Church (the oldest parish in Hyde Park, now Iglesia de San Juan), the latter of which was designed by the architectural form of Cram Wentworth & Goodhue and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Hyde Park is also the original home of the Boston Crusaders, a world class drum and bugle corps founded in 1940 at the Most Precious Blood Parish."

They played important public roles throughout their lives in ending slavery and promoting women's suffrage.In the 1970s, desegregation busing of the Boston Public Schools caused an explosion in public activism. Public meetings and protests from concerned parents of affected children continued for years. The issue united Hyde Park with surrounding areas in an attempt to form a new school district for the purpose of avoiding desegregation. Public tension over busing lasted for more than a decade.\nHyde Park is home to a large Haitian community that arrived from the island during the 1980s and on into the 1990s. Immigrants from rural areas of Haiti had limited education beyond early elementary school years. As a result of a Federal lawsuit by parents from Hyde Park and other areas of the city, Boston Public Schools were mandated to provide a comprehensive literacy program. The Haitian Literacy Program has been housed at Hyde Park High School since 1989.Hyde Park is currently under a major redevelopment effort by the Boston Redevelopment Authority. The Hyde Park Neighborhood Strategic Plan was adopted by BRA. As of yet, the plan has not met notable public resistance. Its aim is to change the zoning regulations in Hyde Park, with an emphasis on public transit and pedestrian use. Though, there is currently a proposal by non Hyde Park residents to create an urban farm that is receiving public resistance."

        "content": "By the time Hyde Park was incorporated into the City of Boston, B.F. Sturtevant Co had a 20-acre industrial park in the Readville area. It became one of the largest fan manufacturing plants in the world. The plant employed 1,500 people in Hyde Park.In the early part of the 20th century, Hyde Park hosted harness racing. The site of the track was redeveloped on the former site of Camp Miegs. The Readville Trotting Park was neighbored by the large B.F.Sturtevant plant, thus prompting the installation of a railway station. The track migrated from horses to auto racing, which was the main attraction at the track until its closure in 1937.In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works attempted to implement two separate interstate highway expansion projects. Both plans would have created a highway that would have passed through land in Hyde Park. The projects were started but, because of public opposition, were never finished. Interstate 695 and the Southwest Corridor would have run right though Hyde Park, effectively cutting it in half. Hyde Park residents considered seceding from the City of Boston. Residents from Hyde Park and other surrounding communities affected by the proposed project banded together and held a large protest on Boston Common, during what was called \"People Before Highways Day\". This rally proved to be crucial in having the plan stopped.Because of the presence of the Stony Brook Reservation, a large part of Hyde Park's interior is effectively off-limits to any new development. The Stony Brook Reservation is a part of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.In April 2008, the Boston Redevelopment Authority Board, along with Mayor Menino, voted to remap and rezone Hyde Park. Mayor Menino appointed an advisory group of 13 residents to assist the BRA in creating a comprehensive rezoning plan. After two years, with input from city agencies and the community at large, BRA adopted the Hyde Park Neighborhood Strategic Plan. BRA then went on to hire a team of consultants from the urban architecture and design firm of Crosby Schlessinger Smallridge. Articles and a new zoning map were prepared and presented to the Boston Redevelopment Authority Board, which accepted it. The Boston Zoning Commission subsequently agreed to the plan in February 2012."

Crocker (1818\u20131875), a wealthy California lawyer and judge, and his wife, Margaret Crocker (1822\u20131901), began to assemble a significant collection of paintings and drawings during an extended trip to Europe, from 1869 to 1871. Upon their return to Sacramento, they set about creating an art gallery in part of their grand home at the corner of Third and O streets. When the gallery was completed they opened it to the public to fund the Sacramento Library. When it opened with 694 paintings the gallery boasted the largest privately collection in the country, and held more paintings than the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The gallery became of the hub of social activity in Sacramento, hosting benefits for local organizations and welcoming prominent visitors including the Hawaiian queen, Lili\u02bbuokalani (1878), President Ulysses S. Grant (1879), and Oscar Wilde (1882).\nE. B. Crocker died in 1875. In 1885, his widow loaned the gallery to the California Museum Association (CMA) for Central California's first Art and Curio Loan Exhibition. This exhibition went on for two weeks and was a complete success. When it finished, the CMA's president, David Lubin, asked that Margaret (and E.B. Crocker's three daughters, who had equal rights to the gallery through Crocker's will) donate the space to the museum association to ensure the long term preservation of the gallery. They agreed, but on the condition that they raised funds for upkeep that they were not able to reach. Instead, she gave the property to the city, which gave the association the right to occupy the property, and made Margaret Crocker the director. She presented the E. B. Crocker Art Gallery and collection to the City of Sacramento and the California Museum Association, \"in trust for the public,\" the contents of which were valued at the time at more than $500,000. A school of art was established at the gallery in 1886.In 1978, the Crocker Art Gallery was renamed the Crocker Art Museum. In 2002, to accommodate a burgeoning collection and the needs of the growing population of Sacramento and California's Central Valley region, the museum commissioned the firm of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates to design a major addition.  The greatly expanded Crocker Art Museum opened on October 10, 2010."

        "content": "At the beginning of the 20th century, the economy was based on agriculture: large-scale cotton farming, coffee and cereals, and cattle raising, goats, sheep and cattle, favoring the export of sheep skins raw or tanned, dry leather and salty, as well as lump cotton and live cattle. Cotton was the culture that most contributed to the economic development of the municipality. Between 1930 and 1955, the production was so great that the producers started to benefit it in the field even using handmade machines. Faced with the success of cotton growing, odern cotton factories were installed in the city. The municipality had six plants in operation. Since 1980, the crop has declined, due to several factors, as an nterruption of financial aid by the government, (such as crop insurance), cotton boll weevil (pests that destroy crops), high interest rates for production financing, and of the processing. Currently, the production of passion fruit has been outstanding, in the district of Itaquara\u00ed, one of the largest production locations in Brazil.\nIn 1930, two important events marked the economic history of the municipality: the arrival of the mining company Magnesita S.A., today, RHI Magnesita founded by two French friends naturalized Brazilian and resident in Brazil, Miguel Pierre Cahen and Georges Louis Minviele - in partnership with Ant\u00f4nio Mour\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es -, a politician of the time, and the construction of the Federal Railroad Network (RFFSA), which would facilitate the transportation of the newly discovered ore to the port of Aratu in Salvador. Both events occurred in 1939. The Magnesita company was authorized to operate in 1940 through Decree n\u00ba 6220 and since then, it has exploited most of the magnesite and mineral talc reserves contained in Das \u00c9guas Saw. In the 1970s, Brumado arrived at the Brazilian Refractory Products Industries (IBAR S.A.). The company interested in extracting magnesite has established its facilities in the northern part of the saw. In the following years, the municipality witnessed great changes, such as large-scale population growth, construction of houses and commercial establishments. Faced with this great attraction, people from other cities were arriving, commerce strengthened, and the  Brumado city became known by recent events. To the south of the former Das \u00c9guas farm was formed a kind of closed condominium: the Catiboaba village; The Presidente Get\u00falio Vargas village was also formed around the company, fruit of the flow of workers who came from the most varied places to work in the mines of magnesite and mineral talc. In 1969, it was the turn of Xilolite S.A., which also settled on the north side of the mountain range and has since exploited magnesite and mineral talc, with the acquisition of one of the mines in 1973. In 1993, Matsulfur, a cement factory, later acquired by Lafarge, under the name Cement Brumado, today Cimpor, Cimento de Portugal (Cement of Portugal), belonging to InterCement (Camargo Corr\u00eaa Group)."

Among the early explorers French Canadian to visit the area of the island, there were fur traders who practiced trade, Catholic evangelists and explorers designated by the civil and religious authorities. Annually, at the end of spring, loggers went around the banks of the river, including the island to the Cross to return to the water the logs coming down the river to sawmills downstream, including Saint-Stanislas. Log drives ended in 1963 on Batiscan River. After the season of logs driving many workers became \"cageux\" (cage workers) for sawmills, others often went to work on farms in the Lower or Middle-Batiscanie.\nIn the 19th century, the government was granting logging on public lands more distant from the Lower Batiscanie. Prior to the 1888-1889 construction of the railway to Upper Batiscanie, every winter, ice roads were constructed on the Batiscan River by forest contractors to bring hundreds forest workers at a time, accompanied with their herds of horses (sometimes over 100 horses), their sleights, all required rigging and provisions for the use of forest sites in Middle or Upper Batiscanie Batiscanie.

Bakhti\u0101ri is primarily spoken in the valleys of the higher areas in the western half of the province. It is also spoken in the lower areas around Lordeg\u0101n in the south, and by speakers who have moved into the cities in the north-east.In the north-east quarter of the province, people in most cities and villages speak either Ch\u0101rmah\u0101li (also in the Southwestern branch of Iranian) or Chaharmahali Turkic. Ch\u0101rmah\u0101li is transitional between Bakhtiari and Persian varieties of Isfahan province, but more similar to the latter. Ch\u0101rmah\u0101li varieties spoken in cities include Dehkordi (in Shahr-e Kord), Ghafarrokhi (in Farrokh Shahr), Heysheguni (in Hafshej\u0101n), and Borujeni (in Borujen). There are also many other varieties of Ch\u0101rmah\u0101li spoken in rural areas.

The Ch\u0101rmah\u0101li and Turkic language areas overlap with one another, and in the foothills of the Zagros and in the larger cities, they intermingle with Bakhti\u0101ri as well.Tehrani-type Persian is now being taught by parents to children as a first language in some parts of the province, with the highest concentrations in the cities.\nThe Atlas of the Languages of Iran (ALI) published a series of language maps for Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari province, including a point-based and polygon (area-based) language distribution maps, and several linguistic data maps.Written descriptions of some of the Bakhti\u0101ri varieties in the province. and a lexicon of the Bakhti\u0101ri language have also been published."

During Genghis Khan's invasion, Abu Talib fled with his family, first to Khorasan and then to Lahore. In 1286, his son Aziz ud-Din went to Delhi, and his own son Ala ud-Din eventually settled in Bado Sarai, in Barabanki district. Ala ud-Din had two sons: Jalal ud-Din and Jamal ud-Din. Jalal ud-Din incurred the ire of the Delhi sultan Ghiyath ud-Din Tughluq, who had him executed. Ghiyath ud-Din later tried to make amends to Jamal ud-Din by granting him 25,000 bighas of land, revenue-free, in Barhauli, on the south bank of the Gogra, and another 25,000 in Jarauli on the north bank.While Jamal ud-Din had no trouble establishing himself in Barhauli, he faced stiff resistance from Raja Chhatarsal, the Bhar ruler of Jarauli, and died without taking control of the fort of Jarauli. His son, Sayyid Zakariyya, finally gained control of the fort in 1340, probably because of military support from Muhammad bin Tughluq, who is known to have been in the Bahraich area during that year.In 1800 the Jarwal Sayyids, some of them Shi\u2018is, displaced the Ansari Shaykhs and came to hold 276 out of 365 villages in the parganah, although their holdings thereafter declined rapidly to (a still formidable) 76 villages in 1877. Khateeb-ul-Iman Maulana Syed Muzaffar Husain Rizvi Tahir Jarwali (1932-Dec 1987) a Shia religious leader was one of the prominent Jarwali Sayyid and celebrated preacher of late 20th century (1970s & 80s), he was also General Secretary of All India Shia Conference for some time.\n\n\n== References =="

Henry Smith (d. 1627) was a wealthy citizen and salter of London who gave much money to parishes in London and Surrey during his lifetime and in his will. He is buried in Wandsworth parish church and is supposed to have been born in Wandsworth. In 1617 he gave \u00a3500 towards the purchase of land in Carshalton, the rent of which was to support the poor of Wandsworth. Another \u00a3100 bequest came from Mrs. Elizabeth Blackwell. In 1814 the lands were described as being just over 116 acres and having a building, barn and outhouses. The Wandsworth Poor Lands lay on either side of Wrythe Lane at the southernmost part of the St. Helier estate footprint. Another local benefactor was Christopher Muschamp, who died in 1660 and is buried at All Saints, Carshalton. He bequeathed \u00a3200 to buy land, the yearly rental of which was to purchase apprenticeships for two poor children who had been born in the parish. Pasture land was bought from Henry Byne in Cannon Sheephouse Lane, which is now known as Green Wrythe Lane. Like the adjoining Sutton Common, most of the area remained semi-rural until the early 20th century.\nThe estate was built between 1928 and 1936 by the London County Council as an overspill estate for the re-housing of people from decaying inner London areas. It was designed as a garden city, with landscaping by the landscape architect Edward Prentice Mawson.\nDevelopment was spurred by the opening of Morden Underground station in 1926, and the Wimbledon to Sutton railway line in 1930, with a station at St Helier. These services provided rapid links into central London for the residents.\n\nThe estate was named in honour of Lady St Helier, who was an LCC Alderman from 1910 to 1927. It was the second largest (after the Becontree-Dagenham estate) of a series of 'out-county' cottage estates and was based on the Garden City ideas of Ebenezer Howard. The area had previously consisted largely of lavender fields, the last remnants of the famous Mitcham lavender industry.\nIn remembrance of the area's historic ownership by Westminster Abbey, the roads are named in alphabetical order after Monasteries and Abbeys starting in the north-west with Aberconway Road and ending with Woburn Road in the south-east.\nThe imposing St Helier Hospital was opened in 1938. John Major, UK Prime Minister from 1990 to 1997, was born there in 1943.The estate's Bishop Andrewes Church, in Wigmore Road, was designed by the architect Geddes Hyslop in 1933."

The hospital still exerts an imposing presence on the estate, both economically and physically. Most of the buildings are original and many are still being used for their original purposes. There has some infilling around the outskirts, and the estate now merges into the suburbs of Sutton, Carshalton and Morden.\nThe area is served by London Bus routes 80, 151, 154, 157, 164, 280, 470, N44, S1, S2 and St Helier railway station."

The city of Aksaray lies 30\u201340 kilometres (19\u201325 mi) northwest from Mount Hasan, while the settlements of Helvadere, Ulu\u00f6ren, Dikmen and Ta\u015fp\u0131nar lie clockwise from north to northwest around the volcano. In addition, there are seasonal settlements on the volcano which are associated with summer pastures.Mount Hasan is part of a larger volcanic province in Central Anatolia known as the Central Anatolian or Cappadocian Volcanic Province., which includes ignimbrites, monogenetic volcanic fields and stratovolcanoes such as Mount Erciyes, Mount Hasan, Karacada\u011f and Melendiz Da\u011f with an area of about 20,000 square kilometres (7,700 sq mi)-25,000 square kilometres (9,700 sq mi). Volcanism took place during the Plio-Pleistocene and into the Quaternary.The volcano has two summits, the 3,069 metres (10,069 ft) high eastern Small Hasan Dagi/K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Hasanda\u011f and the 3,253 metres (10,673 ft) high Big Hasan Dagi/B\u00fcy\u00fck Hasanda\u011f; both are located within a caldera and consist of lava domes and lava flows. Big Hasan Dagi has two nested craters with an 800 metres (2,600 ft) wide and 200 metres (660 ft) high inner cone that is the source of a lava flow. Fossil rock glaciers are found on the volcano. The volcano as a whole rises almost 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) around the surrounding terrain and covers an area of 760 square kilometres (290 sq mi) with 354 cubic kilometres (85 cu mi) of rocks. The terrain of Mount Hasan is formed by phreatomagmatic breccias, ignimbrites, lahar deposits, lava domes, lava flows and pyroclastic flow deposits. The pyroclastic flow deposits occur in the form of fans or valley flows, when they were channelled by topography. The northern flanks also feature two debris avalanche deposits with hummocky surfaces. A second caldera lies on the southeastern flank. The volcanics of Mount Hasan have been subdivided into a \"hot flow\" unit, a \"Mt. Hasan ashes\" unit and into a lava unit.Cinder cones, maars and accompanying lava flows also occur around Mount Hasan, they are part of a basaltic volcano family that forms parasitic vents. These include the Y\u0131praktepe cone/maar and a lava flow field at Karata\u015f which covers an area of 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi) and was produced by fissure vents. Many of the cones around Mount Hasan have been grouped as the Hasanda\u011f-Karacada\u011f volcanic field."

        "content": "As a consequence of the subduction and eventual closure of the Neo-Tethys and continental collision between Arabia-Africa and Eurasia, Anatolia moves westward between the North Anatolian Fault and the East Anatolian Fault. This movement and the resulting tectonic deformation of Anatolia are responsible for volcanism in Central Anatolia which has been ongoing for the past 10 million years; this volcanism is defined as \"post-collisional\". Further, volcanism at Mount Hasan has been related to the Tuz G\u00f6l\u00fc Fault and its intersection with the Karaman-Aksaray faults; the former of these is one of two major fault systems in Central Anatolia which influence volcanism there, and volcanic products of Mount Hasan have been deformed by the fault. The Hasandag fault branches off the Karaman-Aksaray fault and cuts between the two summits of Mount Hasan. It and the Karaca\u00f6ren fault influence the hydrothermal system of the volcano.The westerly Mount Hasan, central Ke\u00e7iboyduran and easterly Melendiz Da\u011f form a mountain range, which is surrounded by plains and whose summits reach heights of over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft). Of these mountains, Melendiz Da\u011f is more heavily eroded compared to the steep cones of Hasan and like Ke\u00e7iboyduran is of early Pliocene age. This alignment is congruent with the tectonic patterns of Anatolia, where the collision between Africa and Eurasia follows the same trend. It and to some degree Mount Hasan are also surrounded by a large depression, and the volcanoes of this alignment are separated by faults. Additionally, Mount Hasan forms a volcanic lineament with Karada\u011f and the Karap\u0131nar Field.The basement in Central Anatolia is formed by magmatic, metamorphic and ophiolitic rocks, the former of which are of Paleozoic to Mesozoic age; it crops out at scattered sites and in the Kirshehir and Nigde massifs. The surface however consists mainly of Tertiary volcanic rocks, which are formed both by volcaniclastic material and individual volcanoes. Central Anatolia has undergone uplift, for which several mechanisms have been proposed."

Aside from the felsic central vent volcanism, basaltic volcanism also took place at Mount Hasan throughout its activity; this activity has been dated to 120,000, 65,000 and the most recent event 34,000 years ago. This volcanism however is not part of the actual Mount Hasan system. The main edifice has produced about 1\u20130.3 cubic kilometres (0.240\u20130.072 cu mi) of magma every millennium, more than at Erciyes.Ke\u00e7ikalesi is the oldest (13 million years) volcanic structure, it is among the oldest volcanoes of the Central Anatolian volcanic province. This volcano is a small sized volcano with a caldera which crops out on the southwestern side of Mount Hasan. It grew over sediments to a present-day elevation of 1,700 metres (5,600 ft); today it is eroded, partly buried by the younger Hasan volcanics and disrupted by strike-slip faulting. About 7 million years ago the Paleovolcano began to grow north of Ke\u00e7ikalesi; it too is buried by more recent volcanics but part of its deposits crop out on the northwestern flank of Mount Hasan in the form of ignimbrites, lahars and lava flows. The Paleovolcano also formed a caldera which produced the rhyolitic Dikmen-Taspinar Ignimbrites; formerly the Cappadocian tuffs were in general attributed to volcanism at Mount Hasan, Mount Erciyes and G\u00f6ll\u00fc Dag. The Quaternary activity gave rise to the Mesovolcano and Neovolcano, with the former centered between the two present-day summits. This volcano produced ignimbrites, lava domes and lava flows and eventually a caldera; it too has been dissected by faulting which probably also influenced the development of the volcano and its activity probably occurred between 1 and 0.15 million years ago. Finally, the Neovolcano grew within the caldera, producing various kinds of deposits; these include lava domes with accompanying pyroclastic flow deposits, breccia in the rim of the Mesovolcano caldera that probably formed through the interaction of intruding magma with water in the caldera, 700,000 years ago rhyolitic flows and ignimbrites accompanied by the formation of another, 4 by 5 kilometres (2.5 mi \u00d7 3.1 mi) caldera, and finally andesitic lava flows and lava domes which form the two main summits. Small Mount Hasan is probably older as it is more heavily eroded while the morphology of Big Hasan Dagi is fresher although its pyroclastic flow deposits are heavily incised. Dates of 33,000 and 29,000 years ago have been obtained on the summit domes and ages of 66,000\u00b17,000 years on the most recent monogenetic volcano south of Mount Hasan. Explosive eruptions took place 28,900 \u00b1 1,500 and 13,500 \u00b1 1,500 years ago. Tephras found in the Konya plain and in a lake of the Turkish Lakes Region have been attributed to Mount Hasan. The debris flow from Mount Hasan occurred 150,000-100,000 years ago and a number of lava flows were emplaced during the last 100,000 years."

        "content": "With the boom economy after World War II, people had time and money for recreation. People from Baytown especially began to take advantage of the drawbridge and built small summer/weekend houses or \"fishing camps\" along the shoreline of the present Beach City. By the early 1950s, they had nicknamed FM-2354 \"Tri-City Beach Road\", because the present Baytown resulted from a merger of three smaller towns in 1948.\nHowever, a number who came for recreation decided to stay. By the early 1960s the community commonly called Tri-City Beach had about 500 permanent residents. At that time, the Texas legislature began to consider annexation reform. Previously, Texas municipalities had almost unfettered power to annex adjacent lands. Cities could control vast territories by annexing ten-feet-wide strips surrounding them. During that period, Baytown controlled an area larger than the California city of Los Angeles did. Larger cities could even annex smaller cities, after they had annexed to surround them. Knowing that reform was pending, many cities began a flurry of annexations. Defensively, a number of unincorporated communities began proceedings to incorporate as municipalities. The Tri-City Beach community was one of those.\nOn April 6, 1963, the Tri-City Beach Civic Association was formed. They met to discuss ways to better their community. The officers were Hayden Harper, a local grocer, President; Nina Harper, Secretary; Georgia Mackrell, Chairman of Publicity; and John Jennings, Chairman of the Membership Committee. The association explored a number of ideas, including the construction of a breakwater, and then began considering incorporation as a city. An Incorporation Committee was formed consisting of George Armer, Ruth Hoover, Eloice Jordan, J.D. Nicholson, and Bill White. Ms. Jordan met with County Judge Oscar F. Nelson, Jr. on March 8, 1966, and presented him with a petition for an incorporation election. On March 24, 1966, the Baytown City Council adopted Ordinance 788, consenting to the inclusion of an unspecified part of what Baytown then claimed as its extraterritorial jurisdiction within the proposed new municipality to be known as the City of Beach City. On April 5, 1966, an election was held to determine if the area would become a municipality. The results were 103 for incorporation to 4 opposed. The incorporation of Beach City was finalized by a decree issued by Judge Nelson on April 11, 1966.\nTo prevent annexation by the nearby city of Baytown, this community voted in April 1966 to become incorporated. An election was held on May 21, 1966, to select the first municipal officers. Eloice Jordan was elected mayor.  W.D. Bush, Alvin J. Crawley, William D. Daniel, J.R. Holland, and J.D. Nicholson were chosen as aldermen for the first city council. Gus Dauzat became the first city marshal. Later Ruth Hoover was appointed by the Council as city secretary and Claude Galloway as deputy marshal.\nThe mayors of the city have been (by date of election):\n\nEloice Jordan \u2013 April 6, 1968\nJimmy McClellan \u2013 April 7, 1970\nHerschel Scott \u2013 April 27, 1976\nJim Ainsworth \u2013 May, 1982\nA.R.  \"Rusty\" Senac \u2013 April, 1986\nJames Standridge \u2013 May 26, 1992\nA.R. \"Rusty\" Senac \u2013 May 23, 2000\nGuido Persiani \u2013 May 25, 2004\nBilly Combs \u2013 May 8, 2010The Beach City Volunteer Fire Department was formed in 1967 and still exists. A Tri-City Beach Emergency Medical service organization had been formed before the city's incorporation and has since been merged into a county-wide emergency medical service.\nWith Baytown's concurrence, Beach City increased its area on August 19, 1968, by annexing approximately 1,781 acres (721 ha) near Point Barrow Road and taking in McCollum Park. The 1968 annexation moved the northern boundary of the city to Lawrence Road. This annexation brought into the city limits the historic home site of early pioneer Solomon Barrow (1801\u20131858), whose land included the area where McCollum Park is now located. The park, as a matter of record, contains the last resting place of Barrow, his wife Elizabeth Winfree, and Barton Clark, the first husband of their daughter Narcissa Ophelia Henrietta Jane Barrow. On October 27, 1970, again with Baytown's concurrence, Beach City annexed the area where the Beach City Community Building and the Beach City VFD fire station are located. That is the only part of the city limits that extends west of FM-2354.\nMeanwhile, there were rumors that Baytown intended to annex the community of Cove. On September 22, 1970, Beach City received a petition of 84 residents of Cove to annex the community. The mayor of Beach City at the time was Jimmy McClellan. On November 24, 1970, Beach City annexed Cove, an area bounded generally on the west by FM-2354, on the east by the Old and Lost Rivers, on the south by Lawrence Road, and on the north by a line just north of FM-565. On December 2, 1970, Beach City extended its Cove annexation to include the property where the old Cove Community Building sits. This time Baytown did not concur. In 1971, Baytown sued Beach City in an attempt to stop the annexation of Cove. In 1973, Beach City released its claim to what are now the city limits of Cove. An incorporation election was held and the City of Cove was incorporated on May 23, 1973. Leroy Stevens was Cove's first mayor. The City Council of Beach City presented to Mayor Stevens Cove's first municipal seal, which is believed to be the one still in use."

The church intended to locate the building in Karl-Marx-Stadt, a longtime center of Communist ideology, as its LDS congregation needed a new chapel.

        "content": "As early as Roman times, there was a settlement at what is now Strohn named Struhna. The view into the distance from the Wartgesberg (mountain) as far as the Altburg and the heights of the Hunsr\u00fcck was used by the Romans, who built watchtowers on its heights.\nEmperor Heinrich VI, who was the great Emperor Barbarossa's son, transferred lordship over Struhna and the estate of Drucksbersch (Trautzberg) to Springiersbach Abbey. This monastery maintained a monasterial estate here with huge forest and land areas. The estate buildings stood in what is today's outlying centre of Sprink. Even today, Springiersbach's coat of arms can be found preserved on a house in Sprink.\nAmong the places named in a confirmation document issued by Heinrich VI to Abbot Absalon von Springiersbach are cropfields and meadows at Struhna. In 1297, Count Heinrich of Luxembourg enfeoffed the knight Richard, Lord of Daun, with the tithes from Stroin. In 1299, the fief was expanded to include the whole village, which hitherto had only been an allodial holding.\nA newly built house \u2013 a fortified one \u2013 was owned in 1336 by Aegidius, Lord of Daun, who, because of this house, had to assume obligations to the Archbishop. In later centuries, the monastery's estate was forsaken. The lands and woods were sold off, and bought up by the villagers. The estate buildings in Sprink were acquired by three families. Even today, there are agricultural businesses being run there.\nIn the Middle Ages, Strohn was also the site of a high court.\nIn the 19th century, Strohn found itself under the lordship of the Count of Daun and thereby belonged to the County of Daun. A great fire struck the village in 1760, and it burnt down utterly. Only one house was left, the Justenhaus owned by the family Schmitz. Even the church's nave burnt down; only the tower remained standing. From inside, the old Marien Glocke (bell) still sounds. It bears the year 1483 and this inscription, in archaic German: Maria hei\u00dfen ich, alle Weder verdriffen ich Claus von Enen gos mich (\"Maria is my name, all weather I drive away, Claus von Enen poured me\").\nDuring the time of French rule, Strohn was the seat of a mairie (\"mayoralty\") in the Canton of Manderscheid and the Arrondissement of Pr\u00fcm, and even into Prussian times, this was still a B\u00fcrgermeisterei (also \"mayoralty\"). On 22 August 1841, with ministerial permission, the B\u00fcrgermeisterei of Strohn was amalgamated with that of Gillenfeld. The B\u00fcrgermeisterei of Strohn included until 1841 Brockscheid, Immerath, mit dem Heckenhofe, M\u00fcckeln mit Schutzalf, Niederwinkel, Oberwinkel, Sprink, Trautzberg and Strotzb\u00fcsch. On the road from Strohn to M\u00fcckeln lies the Herrenb\u00fcsch where graves from Roman times can still be found. Some officers who were here on manoeuvres in 1875 had one such grave right at the roadside opened. Inside, they found jugs still filled with ashes, old coins, swords, amulets and lance heads."

The rock shelter was constructed by tunneling into a naturally eroded cliff face that created a 19 m \u00d7 19 m (62 ft \u00d7 62 ft) sub-horizontal ceiling ranging in height from 1.75 to 2.45 m (5.7 to 8.0 ft) above floor level, the roof is supported by 36 pillars created by the natural erosion of fissure lines in the bedrock. Investigation has shown that some pre-existing pillars were removed, some were reshaped and some moved to new positions. In some areas ceiling slabs were removed and repainted by the people who used the cave. Tool marks on the ceiling and pillars clearly illustrate that the modifications served dual purposes, to providing a living space and to facilitate the removal of rock which was discarded down a talus slope.\nThe floor is covered with soil, a mix of ash from fires, fine sand, silt, and locally fragmented rock to a depth of approximately 70 cm (28 in) which lies in seven distinct horizontal stratigraphic layers. \nCompletely open to the north and south, construction has left the shelter entirely protected from rainfall. The rock shelter features prehistoric paintings of fish, including the Barramundi, wallabies, crocodiles, people and spiritual figures. Most of the paintings are located on the shelter's ceiling, but many are found on the walls and pillars of the site."

They also identified the Jawoyn clan Buyhmi as the traditional owners of the site.The site was first excavated in May 2010.

Radiocarbon dating of charcoal excavated from the lowest stratigraphic layer returned a mean age of 35400\u00b1410 years cal BP while the six upper layers had been deposited over the last 20,000 years. The art is the oldest firmly dated rock painting in Australia.\nHowever, radiocarbon dating of charcoal excavated from the base of the lowest stratigraphic layer of the floor returned a mean age of 45180\u00b1910 years cal BP suggesting the oldest date for the earliest human habitation. \nFaceted and use-striated hematite crayons have been recovered from nearby locations (Malakunanja II and Nauwalabila 1) in strata dated from 45,000 to 60,000 years old which suggests that the Gabarnmung shelter may have been decorated from its inception.The site also includes panels of recent paintings, radiocarbon dated to between AD 1433\u20131631  and AD 1658\u20131952  (calibrated 95% CI), consistent with the reports that the cave was still visited within living memory."

Laichinger, who rented rooms out to others and lived there until his death in 1945. While the house was abandoned for years thereafter, there was some interest in demolishing it and converting the land into a shopping center, though this fell through due to zoning issues.  In the meantime, the house was ransacked for what was left behind, including its furnishings, wooden banisters and even the toilets, becoming a victim of vandalism and negligence.\nThe structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 17, 1980, but was left derelict for many years, before being purchased by Sharyn and George Luedke in an auction in 1994. They had intended to convert it into a hotel, but contrary to earlier assurances at auction, they were unable to secure restoration grant money from any federal, state, or local agencies. Despite this, the Luedkes have overseen a restoration process, funded through donations and tours.

It included lands in the present-day District of Columbia and in Prince George's County, and was composed of previously established land patents such as Henrietta Maria, Widows Purchase, Yarrow and Yarrow Head. Chillum Castle Manor was named after Chilham Castle, the old home of Sir Dudley Digges, an ancestor of William Dudley Digges, in Kent, England.The manor house for the Henrietta Maria parcel was named Green Hill. It was home to William Dudley Digges and was the place where Pierre L'Enfant, designer of nearby Washington, D.C., died in destitution in 1825.  He remained buried at the Green Hill property until being re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery in 1909.  The Green Hill plantation was subsequently purchased by George Washington Riggs, who built the present Green Hill historic home in 1868.Since this area was not served by public transportation, such as a streetcar, Chillum remained rural in character into the 1930s. Beginning in the mid-1930s, the area of Chillum that is close to the District of Columbia border was subdivided into lots. Developers promoted the area\u2019s convenient access into the city as well as its water, gas, and electricity supply. The first platted developments in the late 1930s included Chillum Gardens and Oakdale Terrace. The developers of these communities sold the lots but left the construction of houses to the lot owners. Consequently, the communities were slow to develop. In contrast, the developer-built Green Meadows and Brookdale Manor were platted in the early 1940s and completed by 1942. Other developer-built communities begun in the 1940s include Chillumgate (1946) and Michigan Hills Park (1940s). Several subdivisions were constructed along Riggs Road, Sargent Road, and Sligo Creek Park in the 1950s, including Sargent Knolls (1950), Bel Air Estates (1955), Parkland (1955), Carrington (1957), and Miller Estates (mid-1950s-early 1960s). The street pattern of these communities are typical of their period. They have a grid pattern of streets broken by a few curvilinear roadways and cul-de-sacs. In addition to single-family residences, two apartment communities were constructed in 1949. The Chillum Heights Apartments consist of three story brick structures containing a combined total of 1,147 units. Larger-scale apartment complexes and mid-rise structures were constructed in the 1960s."

It expanded during construction of the Owens Valley aqueduct. The first post office opened in 1910.The Inyokern Elementary School was founded in 1913. The original building was replaced in the mid-1930s by a larger building with a stage and indoor restrooms. This building was demolished in the early 1970s. In the 1930s, half a dozen irrigated farms were scattered around Indian Wells Valley, growing mostly alfalfa and livestock. Community events were held in Inyokern Hall, which still stands.\nWith the onset of World War II, the US Navy located its new Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in Inyokern.  This accounts for the length of the runways and the size of the county airport.  The military base was subsequently moved to the east 12 miles (19 km) and the city of Ridgecrest was established as a commercial support center for that base."

Until the 1990s, the main commercial block of the town along highway 178 was a somewhat picturesque street of older buildings constructed of local rock and bricks, including a vintage post office, cafe, three bars, and a small Chinese restaurant.

Rugged mountains more than 9,000 feet (2,700 m) in elevation west of the area create a pronounced rain-shadow effect, resulting in a shrub-steppe habitat zone with annual rainfall of less than 3 inches (76 mm).  The flora of the valley floor consists primarily of Creosote Bush (Larrea tridentata), Burrobush (Ambrosia dumosa), and several varieties of native bunch grasses.  The transition zone of the nearby foothills also contain mixtures of pinyon pine, Joshua tree forests, and concentrated riparian habitat surrounding the small streams descending from the mountain peaks.\nWildlife ranges from black bear, mountain lion, and whitetail deer in the mountain and transition zones to the kangaroo rat and the endangered desert tortoise on the valley floor.  A special note on the local wildlife is the local subspecies of rattlesnake, the Mojave rattlesnake (also called the Mojave green rattlesnake). This snake, which is common in the area, produces  pit viper venom common to the general species but also produces a neuro-toxin that paralyzes the victim within 15 minutes. The subspecies is docile, and fatal bites are rare.\nIndigenous animals that found in the valley floor are kit foxes, coyotes, bobcats, and roadrunners. Bears and mountain lions occasionally descend from the Sierra Nevada Mountains seeking food."

It also passes through the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. The highway is U-shaped as it rounds the peninsula running through tourist areas in Leland and Suttons Bay in addition to the national lakeshore.\nM-22 is an original trunkline designation dating back to the 1919 designation of the system. Reroutings have moved the highway closer to the water between Suttons Bay and Traverse City. A section of the highway was used temporarily for another highway, M-109. Two sections of the highway have been designated as separate Pure Michigan Byways. The highway marker is used in marketing by a local business as a symbol of the region, a trademark for which has been the subject of legal controversies.

In between the trunkline loops north along Lake Michigan to Northport before turning south along the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay. The road itself comprises numerous turns and hills, making it a very popular drive for tourists visiting the area from areas such as Chicago and Detroit, especially during autumn. The road runs north to the village of Onekama running east and north of Portage Lake before returning north to Arcadia. M-22 turns northeasterly to curve around the north shore of Crystal Lake after passing through Elberta and Frankfort. South of the Platte River, the highway crosses into the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. East of Platte Lake, M-22 turns northward again toward Empire, headquarters of the national park. M-22 takes the inland route between Little and Big Glen lakes, losing the Lake Michigan Circle Tour designation to M-109 until the two meet again in Glen Arbor. The roadway follows the shoreline of Pyramid Point and passes east out of the national park before turning north to Leland.\nContinuing northward, M-22 reaches its northernmost extent in Northport before turning south. It passes through the reservation of the Grand Traverse Band of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians in Peshawbestown, home to one of the tribe's two casinos. Further south is the community of Suttons Bay located on the small bay of the same name. From here south, the highway runs just off the shore of the Grand Traverse Bay south to Greilickville. Just south of Greilickville, M-22 enters a section of the city of Traverse City that is located in Leelanau County, Michigan formed by an acquisition of a neighborhood of Greilickville. Here is the eastern junction between M-22 and M-72. The two highways run concurrently along Grandview Parkway to Division Street. There they meet US 31/M-37 and M-22 ends. A portion of this road has been designated a what is now called a Pure Michigan Scenic Byway by the state of Michigan."

As such, the logo has become a popular symbol for the company as well as a cultural symbol for the western Grand Traverse Bay area.  The private corporation has attempted to trademark the road sign, which has been legally opposed by the Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette; that formal opposition was removed by his successor Dana Nessel in 2019.\nIn 2015, the readers of USA Today voted M-22 the \"best scenic autumn drive\" in the nation, noting that it offers \"116 miles [187 km] of stellar autumn leaf-peeping\".Due to the popularity of the roadway, sign theft along parts of M-22 has become an issue for MDOT. The department announced in 2016 that it was removing the \"M\" from the top of some of the M-22 markers to combat the issue. The state had replaced about 90 signs in the previous three years, and a department spokesman said the popularity of the highway from merchandise sales and scenic travelers factored into those thefts. The new signs cost between $325 and $350 apiece to manufacture, no different from what the standard M-22 signs cost, and MDOT hoped that the modified signs will prove less popular with thieves. The new signs will be installed as replacements in the areas with the most thefts, like Leelanau County, while the rest of the highway will still receive the standard M-22 marker. A year later, sign theft was still an issue. The department started testing pavement markings because the other efforts had failed. The markings cost $175, but they last only three years compared to the ten-year lifespan of a sign."

At that time, M-22 was relocated along the west arm of Grand Traverse Bay onto Center Road up to Crain Hill Road In 1949, M-22 was relocated the rest of the way to Suttons Bay, and the former M-22 on Cherry Bend and Center roads became County Road 633. and in 1945, the last gravel stretch of M-22 from Leland to Northport was paved.In Traverse City, M-22 originally started at Front and Union streets going west on Front to Elmwood, turning north onto Elmwood, then west on Bay Street to Greilickville. It was relocated onto the newly built Grand View Parkway in 1952, from Greilickville to Division Street (relocated US 31).

The A130 road from Sadlers Farm roundabout to Canvey Island follows the route of the original Roman road. Its construction in 1971 brought to light a number of artifacts dating back to the early settlements in the area.\nThe name of the town originates from the time of the Saxon settlers in the 5th century, when the area was largely marshland. They named the area Beamfleote, meaning \"tree stream\", being the area where the creeks from the River Thames adjoined the wooded area to the north. The current spelling was adopted at the time the railway service was brought to the area and a railway station built for the town. Throughout the intervening period various documented versions of the names has been 'Benfleota', 'Beamflet', 'Bemflet', 'Bienflet' and 'Bemfleet'. The last was used on John Norden's maps in the 17th century.\nIn Saxon times the village became known as South Benfleet when a new settlement, which became known as Little Benfleet, developed to the north of the original settlement. The new settlement did not last, and its site, which has since become known as North Benfleet, is now largely rural.\nThe railway was brought to the town in 1855. The new Benfleet railway station connected the town with Southend-on-Sea to the east and London Fenchurch Street station.\nIn July 2002, Castle Point District Council named a 6-mile cycle way, from near Benfleet railway station to near Leigh-on-Sea railway station, the \"de Neumann Way\" after Captain Peter de Neumann, GM."

        "content": "Callowhill is one of the unofficial names for a neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, located roughly in the vicinity of Callowhill Street, between Vine, Spring Garden, Broad, and 8th streets. The name \"Callowhill\" was coined by the Callowhill Neighborhood Association, a community organization in the area; although this name often appears on online maps, the City of Philadelphia does not have an official name for this area. Callowhill is named for Callowhill Street, which was named after Hannah Callowhill Penn, William Penn's second wife and de facto proprietor of Pennsylvania after William Penn.  \nCallowhill was formerly home to large-scale manufacturing and other industries, of which an architectural history has been left in the form of grand old abandoned factories. During the 1970s and 1980s, the population of Callowhill plummeted, and although numbers are rising, it is a fairly unpopulated section of the city compared to surrounding neighborhoods. Recently developers have started to employ adaptive reuse projects, converting them into loft style housing; so much so that many have termed the neighborhood \"The Loft District\". In 2010 the Callowhill Industrial Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places.Callowhill is physically cut off from its neighbor to the south, Chinatown, by the Vine Street Expressway. This has largely prevented Chinese businesses from spreading north, although some industrial and storage uses by the Chinese community have been placed in Callowhill. Vine Street is also blamed for the abrupt drop in pedestrian life above Chinatown, and the struggle faced by efforts to redevelop this section of the city that lies between Center City and North Philadelphia.\nThe former Reading Railroad train trestle, the Reading Viaduct, is a defining feature of the Callowhill neighborhood. Neighborhood groups proposed that the abandoned structure be maintained as a public park. The Reading Viaduct park plan gained momentum in 2009 when Philadelphia's Center City District (CCD), and its influential president Paul Levy, became enamored of the idea and ultimately became a partner to help manage the project. CCD announced on Tuesday, February 6, 2018 that the first phase of the quarter-mile-long, elevated park would open in spring 2018. The actual grand opening of The Rail park was held on June 14, 2018, attracting a large crowd.Philadelphia Traffic Court is in Callowhill, at Spring Garden Street and North 8th Street."

        "content": "In 796 Charlemagne, by permission of Pope Leo III, founded on ground adjoining this spot a hospice for pilgrims, which was intended for the people of his empire. In connection with the hospice was a church dedicated to the Saviour and a graveyard for the burial of the subjects of Charlemagne who died in Rome. From the beginning, this foundation was placed under the care of the ecclesiastical authorities of St Peter's. The decline, soon after this period, of the Carolingian empire, brought the hospice, the Schola Francorum, entirely under the jurisdiction of the basilica; at the same time, the original intent of a place for pilgrims and the poor was preserved. In the complete ruin which overtook Rome during the Avignon Papacy (1309\u20131378), and during the following decades of the Western Schism, the ecclesiastical foundations in the vicinity of St. Peter's sank into decay.After the return of the popes, new life sprang up, and the enthusiasm for building and endowing foundations in the Borgo was rekindled under Popes Martin V, Eugenius IV, and Nicholas V. The remembrance of Charlemagne and his hospice revived in the mind of the large and influential German colony then residing at Rome, and during the reign of Martin V (1417\u20131431) the enlarged cemetery was surrounded with a wall built by Fredericus Alemannus, who also erected a house for its guardians. During the plague outbreak of 1448, Johannis Assonensis, a German confessor attached to St. Peter's and later Bishop of Wurzburg, assembled his countrymen there  and founded among them a brotherhood, the object of which was to provide suitable burial for all poor Germans dying in Rome. When the Holy Year 1450 brought many pilgrims to Rome, the brotherhood built a church, a new hospice for German pilgrims on the adjoining land, and developed the Campo Santo into a German national institution.In the 15th, 16th, and even in the 19th century the German nation was represented at Rome by numerous officials at the papal court and by guilds of German bakers, shoemakers, and weavers; in these ages Germans were to be found in every industry of ordinary life, and German bankers and inn-keepers were especially numerous. Nevertheless, the steadily decreasing German population of Rome during the 17th and 18th centuries caused the Campo Santo, as a national foundation, and the brotherhood to sink into neglect.The church was progressively eclipsed by the church of Saint Maria dell' Anima. In 1876 Pope Pius IX founded a seminary for German-speaking priests for the special study of archaeology and church history to replace the Schola Francorum. Today, the church is still an important gathering place for the German-speaking community in Rome."

Here were situated Signia, Frusino, Fabrateria, Fregellae, Sora, Arpinum, Atina, Aquinum, Casinum, and Interamna; Anxur (Terracina) was the only seaport that properly belonged to the Volscians, the coast from there to the mouth of the Liris being included in the territory of the Aurunci, or Ausones as they were termed by Greek writers, who possessed the maritime towns of Fundi, Formiae, Caieta, and Minturnae, together with Suessa in the interior, which had replaced their more ancient capital of Aurunca. Sinuessa, on the seacoast between the Liris (Garigliano) and the Vulturnus, at the foot of the Mons Massicus, was the last town in Latium according to the official use of the term and was sometimes assigned to Campania, while Suessa was more assigned to Latium. On the other hand, as Nissen points out (Italische Landeskunde, ii. 554), the Pons Campanus, by which the Via Appia crossed the Savo some 9 m. SE of Sinuessa, indicates by its name the position of the old Campanian frontier. In the interior the boundary fell between Casinum and Teanum Sidicinum, at about the 100th milestone of the Via Latina, a fact which led later to the jurisdiction of the Roman courts being extended on every side to the 100th mile from the city, and to this being the limit beyond which banishment from Rome was considered to begin.\nThough the Apennines comprised within the boundaries of Latium do not rise to a height approaching that of the loftiest summits of the central range, they attain to a considerable altitude, and form steep and rugged mountain masses from 4,000 to 5,000 ft. high. They are traversed by three principal valleys: (1) that of the Anio, now called Aniene (and formerly Teverone), which descends from above Subiaco to Tivoli, where it enters the plain of the Campagna; (2) that of the Trerus (River Sacco), which has its source below Palestrina (Praeneste), and flows through a comparatively broad valley that separates the main mass of the Apennines from the Volscian mountains or Monti Lepini, until it joins the Liris below Ceprano; (3) that of the Liris (Garigliano), which enters the confines of New Latium about 20 m. from its source, flows past the town of Sora, and has a very tortuous course from there to the sea at Minturnae; its lower valley is for the most part of considerable width, and forms a fertile tract of considerable extent, bordered on both sides by hills covered with vines, olives and fruit trees, and thickly studded with towns and villages."

It also became known for its soapstone artists. The town has one of the finest churches in Greenland, built in 1909 from wood in the Norwegian style.Following the warming climatic trends since the 1920s, Paamiut developed a booming cod industry between the 1950s and 1989, when the stock dwindled. In connection with a development plan called G60, Paamiut was chosen as to be the place to live for the entire population of the former Paamiut municipality. Therefore, the number of people living there rose significantly during that period.\nThere is local museum downtown in original buildings from the previous century, among them a carpenter workshop and a salt warehouse. The Danish Crown Princely family visited the town as part of an official tour of Greenland in summer 2014."

After some years in the brewery business at several locales in North Hudson, he established the William Peter Brewing Company in 1862 at Hudson Avenue and Weehawken Street in what was then Union Hill. Parts of the imposing structure remained, and were repurposed as a storage facility. While he and his family lived for a time across the street at the since demolished Fausel Mansion, Peter eventually built a mansion across the valley on the  cliff where the library now stands.\nCompleted in 1904 at the cost of $75,000, the home was designed like a German-style castle with 17 rooms and  elaborately decorated with ornate woodwork, marble, stained glass, and several fireplaces. A successful businessman, Peter was also a painter encouraged by Hudson River School artist Max Eaglau and maintained a studio as his home for himself and others to use. The gallery in the house included many works inspired by his native Black Forest and the Catskill Mountains, where he summered. After Peter's death, the house changed hands and was owned for a time by the Arnoldi family. In the 1930s, to make way for the construction of the Midtown-Hudson Tunnel (today's Lincoln Tunnel), the building and others in the neighborhood and along Boulevard East were acquired by the Port Authority. Many were demolished, but the Peter Mansion was spared and later given to the township. The library opened in September 1942 with books and memorabilia donated by local residents.In 1997, the library closed for expansion and renovation. It re-opened in 1999. In March 2022, the town council adopted a $1.4 million bond ordinance to modernize the library. The project includes installation of energy efficient lighting, replacement of exterior windows, improved Wi-Fi, a new HVAC system, an improved electrical system, and  additional USB ports to public work stations."

Alex MacLennan settled a little further west at a site he named the Kennet, later the settlement of Kennett River, after another UK river.Wye River Post Office opened on 19 January 1914, but some time before 1945 it was reduced to a telegraph office for a considerable period of time, mail being delivered from Lorne. A school was established in the local hall in 1920, but only lasted a year, after the closure of a sawmill resulted in a loss of population. The school was re-established in a converted residence in 1931, operated part-time with the Aireys Inlet school from 1935, and closed permanently in 1942.On Christmas Day 2015, a bushfire destroyed at least 98 homes in the area.

The community is located within Lake Township on the shores of Lake Michigan.  For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau defined the community as a census-designated place for the first time for the 2010 census.  At the census, the CDP had a population of 47 and a total land area of 1.26 square miles (3.3 km2).Designed by golf course architects Alister MacKenzie and Perry Maxwell in 1929, the par-70, 6,518-yard (5,960 m) course offers views of Lake Michigan and Crystal Lake. The Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore lies just to its east. Despite being consistently ranked among the top courses in the United States (ranked 10th for 2007\u201308 by Golf Digest) the only tournament of note it has hosted has been the 1991 U.S. Senior Amateur, due to its location far from population centers and the corresponding lack of sufficient facilities (lodging, transportation, infrastructure) needed to accommodate the crowds attracted by major tournament events. Crystal Downs is currently ranked the #19 course in the world according to Golf.com."

In 1810 the Royal Academy catalogues give sculptor Charles Rossi's address as 21 Lisson Grove, where he had bought a large house. By 1817, Rossi was renting out a section of the house to painter Benjamin Haydon. A blue plaque on the corner of Rossmore Road and Lisson Grove marks the spot and in 2000 author Penelope Hughes-Hallett wrote The Immortal Dinner with the focus on Haydon's dining companions invited to his Lisson Grove abode on 28 December 1817. Haydon's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Edwin Landseer lived north on Lisson Grove on the corner of St John's Wood Road from 1825.\nThe arrival of Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema at nearby 44, Grove End Road in the late 1870s inspired the naming of one of the Lilestone Estate apartment blocks built in the 1920s as Tadema House. Eastlake House, opposite Tadema House, is possibly named for Charles Eastlake whose Eastlake movement's underlying ethos of simple decorative devices that were affordable and easy to keep clean would have been of interest to those developing social housing in the 20th Century.\n\nOn Bell Street, the Lisson Gallery, established in 1967 by Nicholas Logsdail, championed the new British sculptors of the 1980s and continues to show new and established artists, with expanded premises further along Bell Street. Mark Jason Gallery at No. 1 Bell Street specialises in promoting contemporary British and international artists.\nIn 2006 the Subway Gallery arrived in the Joe Strummer Subway which runs under the Marylebone Road. Conceived by artist Robert Gordon McHarg III, the space itself is a 1960s kiosk with glass walls which creates a unique showcase for art, interacting naturally with passers by, visitors and the local community.The Show Room is on Penfold Street, next to the main Aeroworks factory. The Show Room is a non-profit space for contemporary art that is focused on a collaborative and process-driven approach to production, be that artwork, exhibitions, discussions, publications, knowledge and relationships.\n\nChurch Street runs parallel to St John's Wood Road and plays host to a varied market Mondays\u2013Saturdays, 8am\u20136pm selling fruit and vegetables, clothes, and bags amongst other items. Towards the Lisson Grove end of Church Street is Alfies Antique Market, London's largest indoor market for antiques, collectables, vintage, and 20th century design is in the former Jordans Department Store, decorated with an Egyptian art deco theme similar to the Aeroworks \u2013 the indoor market, \"houses more than 200 permanent stall holders and covers in excess of 35,000 sq ft of shop space on five floors.\" Opened in 1976 by Bennie Gray, in the then derelict department store, the Antiques Market has since spawned twenty or so individual shops at the Lisson Grove end of Church Street specialising in mainly 20th-century art and collectables"

It was in the hundred of Newton and the tenant-in-chief was William of Mohun.The Church of England parish church of St Paul dates probably from the late 12th or early 13th century, though only the north wall of the nave is original. The first building was likely only about 12 feet (3.7 metres) wide, and in the mid 13th century the chancel and south wall of the nave were rebuilt to a slightly larger floorplan; the nave's north wall should also have been rebuilt at this time, but the work was not completed. New windows were installed in the north wall in the 15th century. The nave's west wall was rebuilt in 1885, extending the building westwards. The parish was the first incumbency of the academic and clergyman Humphrey Gower (1638\u20131711), who later went on to become Master of Jesus College, Cambridge and then St. John's College, Cambridge.\n\nNear St. Paul's is the thatched and mullioned manor house, which dates from the 16th century and which Sir Frederick Treves described in 1906 as \"the most picturesque of its kind\". It has an L-shaped plan and has had several changes since first construction, including the addition of a classical porch around 1600. According to Pevsner the building overall has \"an air [...] of simple innocence under its thatched roof\". It is listed by English Heritage as Grade II*.The old open fields of the parish were enclosed before 1771.Hammoon House was built in the 1890s for use as a hunting lodge by the 2nd Viscount Portman of nearby Bryanston. It is an early example of the use of shuttered concrete as a building material, though the exterior was finished to give an appearance of stone. It is now a private residence."

Part of the estate adjacent to Tooting Junction Railway Station became available in 1892 and was developed as the Furzedown golf course, designed by Tom Dunn. The Seely estate was sold at the beginning of the twentieth century and the golf club moved to South Lodge, Mitcham Common in 1906.\n The roads in this part of \nFurzedown were mainly laid out between 1900 and 1930, covering the former golf course after sale of the estate. Furzedown House, dating from 1794 and enlarged with conservatory and single-storey entrance lodge in the early 1860s, was saved and converted to a teacher training college by London County Council in 1915.In November 2017, Arthur Tingle, who was then nine years old, began a project at Penwortham School. Using Furzedown's online community network, he contacted the businesses on Moyser Road and local residents to ask about what the shops had been in the past, and people's memories of shopping in them.  During 2019, local photographer Alan Weller and Martin Beaver contacted the people that Arthur had contacted \u2013 and more. Their intention is to create an updateable record of the present and enable people in the future \u2013 residents, schoolchildren, local historians, anyone \u2013 to have something to refer back to from this one year. In April 2020 they published a book of pictures and stories of Moyser Road and its shops in 2019, see www.moyserroad.furzedown.net"

        "content": "After Indian Removal in the 19th century, European-American settlers rapidly developed cotton plantations along the Mississippi River, which forms the western border. The intensive cultivation depended on the labor of numerous enslaved African Americans; in the early 19th century, more than a million slaves were relocated to the Deep South from the Upper South in a major forced migration. The population of this county quickly became majority black as enslaved workers were brought in to develop plantations. Much of the bottomlands and interior were undeveloped frontier until after the American Civil War.\nThe West Feliciana Railroad was later built to help get the cotton commodity crop to market. Some planters got wealthy during the antebellum years and built fine mansions in the county seat of Woodville, Mississippi. Jane and Samuel Emory Davis moved here in 1812 with their several children, and lived at a plantation near Woodville. Their youngest son, Jefferson Davis, attended the Wilkinson Academy in Woodville for two years before going to Kentucky to another school.After the Civil War, freedmen and planters negotiated new working arrangements. Sharecropping became widespread. Although cotton continued as the commodity crop, a long agricultural depression kept prices low.\nFollowing Reconstruction, white violence against blacks increased through the later decades of the 19th century and into the early 20th century. According to 2017 data compiled in Lynching in America (2015-2017), some nine lynchings of African Americans were recorded in Wilkinson County.The peak of population in the county was reached in 1900, after which many blacks left in the Great Migration to the North and Midwest. The county has continued to have a black majority population.\nIn the early 20th century the boll weevil infestation destroyed much of the cotton crops, and mechanization caused a further loss of agricultural jobs. The exit of many African Americans from the state did not change the state's exclusion of African Americans from politics. They were not enabled to vote until after passage of the federal Voting Rights Act in 1965 and its enforcement. Cotton cultivation was revived, but it is produced on a highly mechanized, industrial scale.\nSouthwest Mississippi was an area of continuing white violence against blacks during the Civil Rights Movement. In February 1964, the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan officially formed. Clifton Walker, 37, a married father of five and employee of International Paper Company in Natchez, who was not politically active, was killed in an ambush on Poor House Road near his home. The evidence showed there had been a crowd of shooters on both sides of the road. This lynching cold case has never been solved, although it was among numerous ones that the FBI was investigating since 2007, before the Donald Trump administration ended the effort in 2018.\nTimber has been harvested and processed in the county as a new commodity crop. The population of the rural county has continued to decline because of lack of jobs. It is still majority African American. Towns have started to develop heritage tourism to attract more visitors."

Contact with Europeans in the late 1700s led to the spread of smallpox and other diseases, which devastated the Atfalati population. In 1851, due to population pressures from white settlers, surviving members of the tribe negotiated a treaty with the Oregon Territory ceding their ancestral lands throughout the Tualatin Valley to guarantee a small reservation on the banks of nearby Wapato Lake. This treaty was never ratified, and in the late 1850s, the U.S. government relocated the tribe to the Grand Ronde Reservation.Large-scale American settlement of the region began in the 1850s, due to the Donation Land Claim Act, which granted land to white settlers who moved to the Oregon Territory before 1855. In the 1870s, the West Side Railroad was built from Hillsboro to Corvallis, cutting through this region. The community of Gaston developed from a railroad stop in 1872 to a commercial center, hosting a school, post office, hotel, and blacksmith shop. Due to legal disputes, Joseph Gaston left his position at the railroad and moved to the region in 1880. He spent the next sixteen years attempting to drain Wapato Lake for farmland.The nearby community of Cherry Grove was founded in 1911 as a logging hub and briefly eclipsed Gaston. Gaston was formally incorporated in 1914. By 1916, the town possessed a general store, bank, and other enterprises. In early May 1935 workers at the Stimson Mill went on strike.  On May 22, activists left the Labor Temple in Portland to support the strikers. The next morning Oregon governor Charles Martin ordered the state police and National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. Armed with gas grenades and machine guns, the military and police forces demanded the strikers leave or be shot. The strikers chose to disperse, averting a potential bloodbath."

The Town of Fogo Island encompasses Fogo, Joe Batt's Arm-Barr'd Islands-Shoal Bay, Seldom-Little Seldom and Tilting, with the unincorporated areas of Fogo Island. It lies off the northeast coast of Newfoundland, northwest of Musgrave Harbour across Hamilton Sound, just east of the Change Islands. The island is about 25 km (16 mi) long and 14 km (8.7 mi) wide. The total area is 237.71 km2 (91.78 sq mi).\nThe island had a population of 2,706 people in the 2006 census, 2,395 in the 2011 census, and 2,244 in the 2016 census.Though migratory French fishermen visited Fogo Island from the early 16th century until 1718, the first permanent settlement of the island took place in the 18th century. Fogo Harbour and Tilting Harbour were the first settlements on the island. The English and Irish descendants of the first inhabitants retained traces of their Elizabethan English and Old Irish dialects, which can be heard on the island today. The island has many ancient folk customs brought from England and Ireland, but they are disappearing."

        "content": "Fogo Island is one of the oldest named features on the coast of Newfoundland. The Bertius map from 1606 shows Fogo Island as one of only about a dozen important features around the coast of Newfoundland. On French maps of the 16th to 18th centuries, the island is referred to as Ile des Fougues. The island was likely named by Portuguese explorers and early fishing crews in the 16th century (Fogo means Fire in Portuguese).\nUntil 1783, Fogo Island was on an area of the coast called the French Shore. Though English and Irish were not supposed to settle here, under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, they did settle; by 1750, Fogo was a thriving part of the British mercantile system of fisheries, based out of West Country English towns such as Poole, in Dorset.\nTilting Harbour on Fogo Island is a National Cultural Landscape District of Canada and is Newfoundland and Labrador's first Provincial Heritage District. Tilting is unique for its Irish culture and, some people say, its Irish dialect. The Irish Cemetery in Tilting may be the oldest in North America.\nLocal oral history indicates that Tilting was originally a French harbour before becoming a venue of Irish settlement. This is highly likely, given the traditional commercial and cultural links between southern Irish and northern French fishing ports. The first Irish settled in Tilting in the 1750s, and uniquely for Newfoundland, Tilting evolved into an exclusively Irish and Catholic town by the 1780s.\nBeothuk traversed Fogo Island for many hundreds of years before Irish and English settlers arrived. The Beothuk pursued the seal and salmon fisheries in the area. They also travelled out to the Funk Islands to collect feathers and eggs from the birds there. In the early years of European settlement at Fogo, there were incidents of violence between the Beothuk and the Europeans. This contact ended around the year 1800. The Beothuk became extinct as a people in the late 1820s.\nFogo Island first attracted Europeans because of the extensive opportunities for commodity harvesting, including seal skins and oil, lumber, fur-bearing animals, salmon and of course cod. Over time, settlers on the island concentrated on processing dried cod, mainly because that was the product that most interested the merchants who dealt in the region of Fogo. From about 1850 until the widespread depletion of fish stocks in the 1990s, cod was king. In recent years, the economy of the island has seen diversification away from solely fishing to tourism and cultural industries.\nFishing has always been a hard life. Before Confederation with Canada, the mercantile classes of St John's, Newfoundland became rich by holding a near-monopoly stranglehold on both the supply of goods to the Newfoundland outports and on the sale of fish from them.\nIn the early 20th century, the Fisherman's Protective Union was formed in an attempt to break this stranglehold. It was a form of co-operative with general stores owned by fishermen for fishermen. One of the Fishermen's Union stores still stands at Seldom-Come-By on Fogo Island, now open as a museum complete with general store, port installations, fishing implements and equipment for the manufacture of cod-liver oil.\nToday, the Fogo Island Cooperative continues to successfully stake footholds in new fish markets. Communities began recognising the appeal of their land and heritage as cultural tourism opportunities.\nCrab and lobster fisheries have largely replaced the cod fishery; a fish-packing plant remains in operation in the town of Fogo.\nA Marconi radio transmitting station was once operational atop a hill near the town of Fogo; operating with a spark-gap transmitter to establish maritime communications, the station was forced to close around the time that radio became common for household use as the spark-gap design generated unacceptable levels of radio interference. Efforts to rebuild this station as a historic site commenced in 2002.\nIn 1967, the island played a key role in the development of what came to be known as the \"Fogo Process,\" a model for community media as a tool for addressing community concerns, when an Extension field worker from Memorial University, Fred Earle, and Colin Low shot 27 films with Fogo Islanders as part of the National Film Board of Canada's Challenge for Change program.Residents defeated the Smallwood government's plans to resettle elsewhere  Fogo Islanders in the 1950s but by 1967 a downturn in the inshore fishery had forced many to turn to welfare support. The northern cod fishery closed in 1992. While the island did recover from the downturn (in part owing to the Fogo Process), the depleted state of the fishery adversely affected islanders for years to come."

When the Federal Government moved the Potawatomie (and the Baptist Mission) to the Kansas River valley in the mid-1840s, brothers William, Peter, and \"Dutch\" Henry Sherman were left as the first permanent settlers. The community was known as Dutch Henry's Crossing because a wagon road forded the creek near the Sherman cabin.The area of Lane west of Kansas Avenue was originally laid out under the name Shermanville in 1855. It was renamed Lane in 1863 for James H. Lane, a leader of the Jayhawkers abolitionist movement, who served as one of the first Senators from Kansas.When the Missouri Pacific Railroad arrived in 1879, a competing community, called either Emerson or Avondale, was laid out east of Kansas Avenue. Within two years the competition between the two towns ceased, and both townsites had merged into the single community of Lane. Lane was incorporated as a city in 1908.Lane is near the site where in 1856, the abolitionist John Brown and four other of his followers hacked five pro-slavery men, one of whom was William Sherman, to death with broadswords near Mosquito Creek and Pottawatomie Creek.

Alexander built a quadrilateral castle, akin to his construction at Newark Castle, with square towers and massive keep. He sited it on flat fen rather than on high ground, perhaps even replacing an earlier moated manor house on the site.\nThe building fulfilled its manor house function for most of its life, never withstanding an armed attack or siege but becoming one of the chief episcopal strongholds and an agricultural focus for the Bishop\u2019s estates in Sleaford and elsewhere. An outline of a 40 by 15 metre tithe barn (said to be the largest in England, and with a cattle shed and hay loft attached) can still be seen in the southern half of the castle.A dam was placed across the river Slea at the end of Westgate, with a two-wheeled watermill behind it, producing large quantities of agricultural products for the local people.The nearest the castle came to a siege were on two occasions when the bishop was forced to hand over his keys to King Stephen during the Anarchy (by Alexander himself, to buy his release after Stephen's successful siege of Newark Castle) and to Edward II in the 1320s when his loyalties were doubted.King John spent a night in the castle in October 1216 just after his disastrous crossing of the Wash and just before his death, and in 1430 Bishop Richard Fleming died in the castle."

On both occasions, and in 1555, it was still said to be defensible and habitable.  John Leland described it at this time as well maintained with a gatehouse, which housed two portcullises, and a high central tower, \"but not sette upon a hille of raised yerth\".\nThe castle began to fall into disrepair during the second half of the 16th century with the timber and lead roof being removed to be reused in buildings in the town, some of which survives to the present day.  The process of decline continued under the ownership of the Carre family. In 1604 it was described as \u2018the late fair castle\u2019, suggesting it had been largely or even fully dismantled before 1600.

The city is built along the shores of Hakata Bay, and has been a center of international commerce since ancient times. The area has long been considered the gateway to the country, as it is the nearest point among Japan's main islands to the Asian mainland. Although humans occupied the area since the Jomon period, some of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period arrived in the Fukuoka area. The city rose to prominence during the Yamato period. Because of the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great distance from the social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo (Tokyo), Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has persisted to the present.\nFukuoka is the most populous city on Ky\u016bsh\u016b island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated by government ordinance on April 1, 1972. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone.\nAs of 2015, Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe. In July 2011, Fukuoka surpassed the population of Kyoto. Since the founding of Kyoto in 794, this marks the first time that a city west of the Kansai region has a larger population than Kyoto."

        "content": "At the start of World War I, Fairbanks-Morse was Beloit's largest employer, producing engines. In 1914, the company began to produce a marine diesel engine, requiring more workers. To meet labor needs, F-M brought in black factory workers, many from the Jim Crow South. Six families came in 1915 - 250 by 1917. Many of the arrivals were unskilled laborers, but there were also blacksmiths, molders, oilers, and a foreman.The influx of new workers produced a housing shortage and Fairbanks-Morse worked to solve the problem. Its subsidiary Eclipse Home Makers, Inc. bought the land that Fairbanks Flats now occupies on the west side of the Rock River across from the factory and planned the rather plain flats there, aiming to contain \"the large number of negroes in one place\" on what was then the edge of town. Meanwhile, the company was planning a separate development for its white employees with single-family homes and curved streets - Eclipse Park - designed by New York architect George B. Post. Segregation wasn't a huge concern then, but the purchase of land for Fairbanks Flats was, because F-M snapped it up just before the city planned to acquire it to be part of a city park/boulevard system. Many felt the tract of land was key to the park system, and the city threatened to condemn the land to stop the land deal. The mayor of Beloit warned that the project could create \"class bitterness that will be enduring and most undesirable for years to come.\" Nevertheless, F-M went ahead with its project.Construction began in late 1917.  Four apartment blocks were built - each with six 2-story apartments. Each building has walls of concrete block, shed roofs, and parapets topping the side walls. The double doors in the front middle of each building is sheltered by a canopy. A simple band of protruding block connects the tops of the windows on each story, but otherwise the buildings are not decorated.In following years, Fairbanks-Morse brought in J.D. Stevenson from Tuskegee Institute to start a YMCA for black youths nearby. The apartments came to be called the Edgewater Flats, but were still administered by F-M officials as late as 1929. Ownership changed after WWII, and people outside of Fairbanks-Morse could rent there. Nevertheless, the Flats remained predominantly black. The NRHP nomination considers the Flats significant as \"an example of the role of private corporations in community planning during an era of rapid industrialization\" and as \"the nucleus of Beloit's twentieth century black community.\"\n\n\n== References =="

It is the fourth most populous city in Australia and Oceania, with a population of over 2.3 million (80% of the state's) within Greater Perth. It is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia, with the majority of Perth's metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp. The city has expanded outward from the original British settlements on the Swan River, upon which its central business district and port of Fremantle are situated.\nPerth was founded by Captain James Stirling in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony. The city is situated on the traditional lands of the Whadjuk Noongar people, where Aboriginal Australians have lived for at least 45,000 years. Perth was named after the city of Perth in Scotland. Perth was proclaimed as a city by Queen Victoria in 1856, although the City of Perth currently governs only a small area around the central business district. Substantial population growth occurred during the late 19th-century Western Australian gold rushes, and the city has continued to expand, particularly after World War II due to a high net migration rate. Post-war immigrants were predominantly from the British Isles and Southern Europe, while more recent arrivals see a growing population of Asian descent. During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, a series of mining booms in various regions of Western Australia propelled Perth into the role of the regional headquarters for significant mining operations.\nRanked as one of the world's most liveable cities, Perth was classified by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network as a Beta global city in 2020. As of 2021, Perth is divided into 30 local government areas, comprising over 350 suburbs. The metropolitan contours span 115 kilometres (71 mi) from Two Rocks in the north to Singleton in the south, and 45 kilometres (28 mi) from the west coast to Sawyers Valley in the east. Beyond the central business district, predominant urban centres within the metropolitan area include Armadale, Fremantle, Joondalup, Midland, and Rockingham. Most of those were originally established as separate settlements and retained a distinct identity after being subsumed into the wider metropolitan area. Mandurah, Western Australia's second-largest city, forms a conurbation with Perth along the coastline. Despite this, it is generally regarded as an independent city for practical purposes.\nPerth features several important public buildings, as well as cultural and heritage sites. The city has various notable government buildings, including the Parliament House, Government House, the Supreme Court Buildings and the Perth Mint. The city is served by Fremantle Harbour and Perth Airport. It was a naval base for the Allies during World War II and today, the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Base West is located on Garden Island. All five of Western Australia's universities are based in Perth."

        "content": "The name of the city is taken from Perth, Scotland in honour of the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, and Member for Perthshire in the British House of Commons, Sir George Murray. Murray's association with the city was included in Stirling's proclamation of the colony, read in Fremantle on 18 June 1829, which concluded with the statement, \"Given under my hand and Seal at Perth this 18th Day of June 1829. James Stirling Lieutenant Governor\". The only contemporary information on the source of the name comes from Charles Fremantle's diary entry for 12 August 1829, which records that they \"named the town Perth according to the wishes of Sir George Murray\".Since 2019, the Noongar name Boorloo has been recognised as denoting the central business district, the local government area, or the capital city in general. The name Boorloo was initially recorded by Robert Menli Lyon as Boorlo in 1833, which was interpreted as \"Perth, properly Point Fraser\" (a location in East Perth). He also gave the name Byerbrup for \"the highland stretching along from Mount Eliza through the centre of the town of Perth\". In 1947, Ludwig Glauert posited that Lyon may have misunderstood his sources and that \"boorloo\" or \"belo\" (now transcribed as \"bilya\") is simply the Noongar word for \"river\". Another source has interpreted Boorloo to mean \"big swamp\", describing the chain of lakes where the central business district and Northbridge are situated."

        "content": "By virtue of its population and role as the administrative centre for business and government, Perth dominates the Western Australian economy, despite the major mining, petroleum, and agricultural export industries being located elsewhere in the state. Perth's function as the state's capital city, its economic base and population size have also created development opportunities for many other businesses oriented to local or more diversified markets.\nPerth's economy has been changing in favour of the service industries since the 1950s. Although one of the major sets of services it provides is related to the resources industry and, to a lesser extent, agriculture, most people in Perth are not connected to either; they have jobs that provide services to other people in Perth.As a result of Perth's relative geographical isolation, it has never had the necessary conditions to develop significant manufacturing industries other than those serving the immediate needs of its residents, mining, agriculture and some specialised areas, such as, in recent times, niche shipbuilding and maintenance. It was simply cheaper to import all the needed manufactured goods from either the eastern states or overseas.\nIndustrial employment influenced the economic geography of Perth. After WWII, Perth experienced suburban expansion aided by high levels of car ownership. Workforce decentralisation and transport improvements made it possible for the establishment of small-scale manufacturing in the suburbs. Many firms took advantage of relatively cheap land to build spacious, single-storey plants in suburban locations with plentiful parking, easy access and minimal traffic congestion. \"The former close ties of manufacturing with near-central and/or rail-side locations were loosened.\"\nIndustrial estates such as Kwinana, Welshpool and Kewdale were post-war additions contributing to the growth of manufacturing south of the river. The establishment of the Kwinana industrial area was supported by standardisation of the east\u2013west rail gauge linking Perth with eastern Australia. Since the 1950s the area has been dominated by heavy industry, including an oil refinery, steel-rolling mill with a blast furnace, alumina refinery, power station, and a nickel refinery. Another development, also linked with rail standardisation, was in 1968 when the Kewdale Freight Terminal was developed adjacent to the Welshpool industrial area, replacing the former Perth railway yards.With significant population growth post-WWII, employment growth occurred not in manufacturing but in retail and wholesale trade, business services, health, education, community and personal services, and in public administration. Increasingly it was these services sectors, concentrated around the Perth metropolitan area, that provided jobs.Perth has also become a hub of technology-focused startups since the early 2000s that provide a pool of highly skilled jobs to the Perth community. Companies such as Appbot, Agworld, Touchgram, and Healthengine all hail from Perth and have made headlines internationally. Programs like StartupWA and incubators such as Spacecubed and Vocus Upstart are all focused on creating a thriving startup culture in Perth and growing the next generation of Perth-based employers."

It had been purchased from a used car salesman in Staten Island by John Krevey in October 1996 and delivered by a tugboat. This barge formerly carried railroad boxcars across the Hudson River before the advent of containerized freight or tunnels beneath the river.  The land side of Pier 63 was formerly used as a freight transfer station for the Baltimore and Ohio railroad where freight was moved from the boxcars on the barges to local conveyance.\nIn the spring of 2007 the barge was relocated from 23rd Street to Pier 66A at 26th Street, on the Hudson River, and was renamed Pier 66 Maritime. The barge currently has an Erie Lackawanna caboose on display.\nTwo historical boats were primarily located here: the lightvessel Frying Pan and the fireboat John J. Harvey.  \nOn the same Pier 66A, there are storage facilities for kayaks, as well as a dock to launch. New York Water Taxi once had a stop on the Pier.\nJohn Krevey, who ran Pier 66 Maritime, died on February 4, 2011. Krevey was one of the earliest members of Friends of Hudson River Park and a member of the Friends\u2019 board of directors until 2010."

St. Thomas' Church also grew, reaching the point that the old frame church was becoming too small for the number of parishioners.  Accordingly, the cornerstone was laid for a new brick church in 1883.  In this same year, the parish was rededicated for Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland; the cemetery retained its former name.Architectural historians have divided the Precious Blood-related churches of western Ohio into multiple generations.  Only a few buildings remain from the first generation, which consisted primarily of small wooden churches, and only St. John's Church in Fryburg to the east remains essentially unchanged.  Replacing these wooden buildings were the churches of the second generation, which were generally small brick buildings without tall spires.  St. Patrick's occupies of a transitional place between the churches of the second and third generations; although it is a small brick building that replaced an early wooden church, its tower resembles those of the High Gothic Revival churches of the third generation.:\u200a2,\u200a3"

The building is designed in a Colonial Revival style with Palladian influences, a popular style in the 1930s due to the recent restoration of Colonial Williamsburg.  It was built on the site of a grammar school that was originally built in the 1890s, but burned in the early 1920s and again in 1927.  The building is constructed of brick, with a full-height portico around the main entry.  Each window on the first floor is topped with an ashlar keystone.  The corners of the main block are adorned with stone quoins.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\n\n== References =="

In 1921, East Bengal Club started playing in the Calcutta Football League Second Division. Most of the matches were held at the Calcutta FC Ground.\n\nAfter the 1923 season, East Bengal Club owners were in the lookout for a club ground of their own where the team can play their matches. According to the existing rule of the maidan, two clubs used to share one common ground. Club's founders and then vice-presidents, Shri Sureshchandra Choudhury and Raybahadur Taritbhushan Ray came to learn that Mohun Bagan shared its ground with National Association, which by that time had ceased to exist. They referred this discrepancy to the police authorities and subsequently demanded the share for East Bengal. It was then that Police Commissioner Charles Tegart ordered Mohun Bagan to share its ground with East Bengal. This sudden decision enraged the Mohun Bagan officials. However, despite their protests, East Bengal Club got the ground for their own in 1924, which they co-shared with their arch-rivals Mohun Bagan until 1963, when finally Mohun Bagan moved out to their own Mohun Bagan Ground. In those days, the goalposts were placed east\u2013west and East Bengal took possession of the half towards the Red Road. Another century-old Kolkata club, Aryan F.C. started sharing the club ground since then."

Built by Marc Seguin and his brothers, it crossed the Seine to the \u00cele Saint-Louis.  It was opened to traffic one year later, on 26 July 1834.  After the French Revolution of 1848 (during which the bridge and its tollhouses were burnt down), it was restored and renamed \"Pont de la R\u00e9forme\", a name it held until 1852.\n\nIn the face of increased traffic (the tollhouses had not been restored), it was demolished to be replaced by the present structure in 1860.  This new structure, an arch bridge, was built by the engineers, Edmond-Jules F\u00e9line-Romany and Jules Savarin, between August 1860 and April 1862, a little further upstream than its predecessor.   The Pont Louis-Philippe was inaugurated in April 1862.  The spandrels above the four-metre-wide piers in the Seine are decorated with stone laurel wreaths surrounding metallic rosettes.\nThe only modification since then (unlike its much-modified contemporary, the Pont de Bercy) was the replacement of the stone guardrails (badly damaged by pollution) with replica railings in 1995."

        "content": "Bennett's Adventure is a historic home located three miles west of Allen, on the north bank of Wicomico Creek in Wicomico County, Maryland, United States. It is a 1+1\u20442-story gambrel-roofed brick house, laid in English bond. It has a traditional two-room plan with central hall. It still has original paneling in the west room and central hall. There were later twentieth-century additions to the house, of a 1+1\u20442-story wing and connecting hyphen. The creek side has a long screened porch.The property is also significant for its associations with Richard Bennett, Puritan governor of the Virginia colony from 1652 to 1655, during the reign of Oliver Cromwell. He had a plantation in Isle of Wight County, Virginia, as well as other properties. Also involved in the colony of Maryland, in 1665 Bennett patented 2500 acres on the north side of Wicomico Creek. His grant was large enough to be classified under the Maryland system as a manor.The property was bought in 1721 by George Dashiell (1690\u20131748) from one of Bennett's grandchildren; he patented 1740 acres after a re-survey. A wealthy planter, Dashiell is believed to have built the house that currently stands on the property. He served in the Lower House of the Assembly in 1724, 1745, and 1746. He attained the rank of Colonel in the Maryland militia by 1736. His family retained the property until 1791.Bennett's Adventure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975."

        "content": "By the 1850s a decision was made to consolidate all the Halifax courts under one roof. After fires razed many downtown buildings during that decade (three major fires destroyed many of the city\u2019s wooden buildings between 1857 and 1861, officials abandoned plans for a wooden structure in favour of a more fireproof option made of stone, to protect the legal records it would house. Following the fires, almost all major buildings were constructed of brick and stone. Built on the grounds of what was then the Governor's Garden, location of the court was as contentious back in the 1850s as location of public buildings it is today. Even when the Spring Garden Courthouse was opened the location remained contentious and lawyers, reported to have \"complained that the building is too far away from the business parts of the city\" and it remained unpopular.\nHalifax carpenter Henry Hill designed the building and Toronto-based architect William Thomas and Sons were retained and created a palatial structure in sandstone. The building was built by contractor George Lang who also built The Halifax Club and the Welsford-Parker Monument at the Front gate of St Paul's Cemetery. Made from brown stone from Mary's Point New Brunswick and Wallace sandstone from Cumberland County. The Wallace quarry sandstone was also used at Nova Scotia's Province House, Province House in Charlottetown and some Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. It was proclaimed in the 1860 Halifax city directory that the \"court house would do honour to any city in Europe, and cannot be surpassed for architectural beauty by any city of the same size on the continent of America.\"\nThe building's architectural exterior is classic with palladian style that represents stability and strength. Decorative features of the building include use of vermiculation and the carving of, replete with carvings of the faces of snarling lions and stern, bearded men in each key stone of the original building's central arches. Interior architectural features to be noted are the pressed metal ceilings, the elaborate arched doorways, the wood paneling and plaster details in the courtrooms and the entry foyer and staircase. In 1863 gas heat replaced 14 fireplaces that inadequately heated the building. The 14 fireplaces remain today though there are none located in the courtrooms.When originally constructed the Courthouse had two courtrooms, judicial robing and jury rooms, a law library and offices for the prothonotary and registrar of chancery. One of the first occupants was the Sheriff and the office of the Sheriff has remained in the court since. Due to the demand for court space, an addition to the back in the 1881\u201382 added additional courts. Matching wings were erected on either end of the building in 1908 (west wing designed by Herbert E. Gates, architect) and 1930 (east wing) to offer additional courtrooms and office space that are now occupied by the Provincial Crown and Judges' Chambers.\nToday the court houses six courtrooms, judges chambers, court administration offices, the Provincial Crown and cells that can jail up to 50 prisoners. The historic character of the Courthouse remain today and ongoing renovations and upgrades are designed ensure that they honour the original architecture design while at the same time providing efficient modern-day court functions.The Courthouse has been designated as an historic site of national significance by the Historic Sites and Monument Board."

        "content": "A collision occurred on December 6, 1917 in Halifax Harbour between the vessels, SS Mont-Blanc and SS Imo and resulted in a blast that decimated the district known as Richmond, in the North End of the city. The courthouse suffered $19,000 in damage even though it was farther to the south. At the time, Nova Scotia Supreme Court cases were heard in court room #2 on the second floor, east side of the stairwell. Courtroom #1 (now #4) was used for everything else including Admiralty Court. The walls of the court room itself had sustained some damage and the blown out windows were boarded up. Purportedly, oil lamps were used because the power was out.A judicial inquiry known as the Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry was formed to investigate the causes of the collision. Proceedings began at the courthouse on 13 December 1917, presided over by Justice Arthur Drysdale. The inquiry's report of 4 February 1918 blamed Mont-Blanc's captain, Aim\u00e9 Le M\u00e9dec, the ship's pilot, Francis Mackey, and Commander F. Evan Wyatt, the Royal Canadian Navy's chief examining officer in charge of the harbour, gates and anti-submarine defences, for causing the collision. All three men were charged with manslaughter and criminal negligence at a preliminary hearing heard by Stipendiary Magistrate Richard A. McLeod, and bound over for trial. However, a Nova Scotia Supreme Court justice, Benjamin Russell found there was no evidence to support these charges. Mackey was discharged on a writ of habeas corpus and the charges dropped. As the captain and pilot had been arrested on the same warrant, the charges against Le M\u00e9dec were also dismissed. This left only Wyatt to face a grand jury hearing. On 17 April 1918, a jury acquitted him in a trial that lasted less than a day.Drysdale also oversaw the first civil litigation trial, in which the owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found Mont-Blanc entirely at fault. Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined Mont-Blanc and Imo were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever convicted for any crime or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster."

        "content": "Pasadena City College was founded in 1924 as Pasadena Junior College. It originally operated on Pasadena High School's campus as an extended learning program of the high school. In 1928, PJC and Pasadena High School formally merged. From 1928 to 1953, it operated as a four-year junior college, combining the last two years of high school with the first two years of college.In 1946, John Muir College was founded due to PJC's enlarged enrollment. The following year, Pasadena Junior College was renamed Pasadena City College. While at John Muir, Fred Phelps was profiled in Time magazine for preaching against \"sins committed on campus by students and teachers ... promiscuous petting ... evil language ... profanity ... cheating ... teachers' filthy jokes in classrooms ... [and] pandering to the lusts of the flesh\". Phelps later became leader of the Westboro Baptist Church.\nIn 1954, John Muir and PCC merged, forming the modern Pasadena City College. In 1966, voters approved the creation of the Pasadena Area Junior College District. The name was subsequently changed to the Pasadena Area Community College District. Pasadena City College is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, an institutional accrediting body recognized by the Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation and the U.S. Department of Education.The Shatford Library is a direct descendant of the original Pasadena High School library that originally occupied the campus. The $16.5-million Shatford Library opened September 7, 1993, and holds 133,024 volumes in the general book collection, over 300 periodical subscriptions (plus over 2,000 titles in electronic databases) 7,338 audio cassettes, 1,019 paperbacks, 661 CDs and software, 404 volumes in the Special Services collection, and 1,186 videocassettes. Walter T. Shatford II, is the attorney for whom the library was named in recognition of his four decades of service on the school's board and his donations. He was also active in the Civil Rights Movement.On March 20, 2003, on the day the United States launched Operation Iraqi Freedom, many students led by the Students for Social Justice, protested on campus against the war. Protesters went through the administration building requesting students to join their cause. Three students were arrested by campus police. That same year, voters approved a bond measure for about $150 million that improved campus facilities. A significant portion of these funds were earmarked for the construction of a new building to house the college's art and music departments. The Alumni Commons, the Aquatic Center, the Boone Sculpture Garden, and the Galloway Plaza have all replaced what were once campus parking lots. A new fourth floor parking structure (Lot 5) and a new bus parking area were completed in 2005.\nIn 2007, many services at the school had to relocate pending demolition of their previous facilities. These included the college bookstore, Student Affairs, Associated Students, the student business services, the campus police and the offices of the school newspaper The Courier. A groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the new Industrial and Technology building, Campus Center and Bookstore took place in October 2007. The Campus Center and Bookstore opened in August 2009. The school is one of the few community colleges with its own observatory, planetarium, and seismograph. Additionally, in 2007 demonstrators from Philadelphia-based Repent America demonstrated on campus, leading to tensions between demonstrators and some students. PCC students, some who were journalism students and staff members of the campus newspaper, PCC Courier, were involved in the May Day melee at MacArthur Park. Later that year, students and faculty held a rally in support of the Jena Six. Some students were beaten and arrested at the MacArthur Park immigrant rights demonstration on May 1, 2007.During 2012 and 2013, the school became embroiled in conflict between students and faculty and the campus administration. On August 29, 2012, the PCC Board unilaterally cancelled the subsequent six-week winter session. One student was arrested at this board meeting. Organized by a newly formed group called Coalition of Students and Faculty for Student Achievement, a rally during the first week back of the illegitimate new Spring semester kicked off a steady wave of student and faculty activism. Eventually, course sections were cut, student transfers to four-year institutions were delayed, overall full-time student enrollments were reduced, and Proposition 30 monies allotted to the school were jeopardized. According to the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, 2012\u20132013 had the lowest full-time enrollments in 17 years at 20,219; Spring 2013 had the lowest full-time enrollments in 10 years at 9838 students.  The Faculty Association filed an unfair labor practice on the District for canceling winter abruptly and won in November 2013. The district filed an appeal to the ruling, thus prolonging the orders to rescind the trimester calendar and return to the status quo while ratcheting up annual 7% compensation to affected employees.In Spring 2013, in an unprecedented move, the Associated Students unanimously censured the administration and passed a vote of no confidence in the school's president, Mark W. Rocha, and collectively called for his immediate ouster. Separately, a vote among full-time faculty members expressed no confidence in Rocha by a margin of 92 percent to 8 percent. The Academic Faculty Senate also voted, 24\u20130, no confidence in the president.The board of trustees remained firm in their support of Rocha, extending his contract another year and giving Rocha a raise. In 2014, however, the faculty maintained its disapproval of the college president's performance as revealed in the faculty-wide evaluation of the PCC President. The negative campus climate has also been a concern with the staff and faculty, which prompted a campus-wide town hall sponsored by the faculty senate. Rocha was named one of Pasadena Weekly's less-than-stellar local \"turkey\" leaders of 2013. After a failed attempt to find work elsewhere, Rocha announced his retirement on August 7, 2014, but later became the Chancellor of San Francisco City College, where after less than three years he was placed on leave in March 2020, according to the San Francisco Examiner.\nIn 2014, the Oscar-winning screenplay writer Dustin Lance Black was invited to speak at commencement, but in a controversial move he was subsequently uninvited by PCC Board of Trustees Anthony Fellow, who said, \"We just don't want to give PCC a bad name.\" According to the Los Angeles Times, \"School officials pretended that Black was never approved as commencement speaker, when in fact they approved him. They said that his brush with a sex scandal has 'no place in public discussion,' when in fact they discussed it with reporters, students and each other.\" The college issued an apology, and later re-extended the invitation."

In the 1950s, the airfield was developed as a part of the Soviet Air Forces' plan to create a ring of air bases around the Arctic for the use of its strategic bomber fleet during the Cold War. During the Cold War, this airfield formed a network of forward staging bases inside the Arctic Circle, the need for which was dictated by geography and weather. The northern parts of the Soviet Union closest to the United States are in the Arctic, with hostile weather conditions. Consequently, Soviet strategic bombers were normally stationed at bases in more temperate parts of the Soviet Union, flying training missions from these forward staging bases. However, the focus on intercontinental ballistic missiles as opposed to bombers meant that the airfield became less important and this was reflected by a gradual reduction in the local population.\nFollowing the 1957 expansion of the airport, construction of a road linking Apapelgino to Pevek began in 1959; in 1961, a bridge was constructed over the Apapelgyn River to complete the link. As Apapelgino grew, a boiler house, greenhouses for growing vegetables, a complex for the lower secondary school, cafeteria and library, a nursery, kindergarten, and a series of apartment buildings were built.\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, however, the reduction in the population was such that it was decided that the remaining residents would be resettled to Pevek, with most residents leaving in 2001. Nevertheless, some refused to be resettled and, for the fear of losing the privileges allotted to the residents of localities in the process of liquidation, continued to reside in Apapelgino even after central heating was turned off. Most of those residents moved out in 2002.Even after Apapelgino was mostly abandoned (with only five people remaining in residence as of 2005), the airport still serves as the main transport hub for Northern Chukotka and the local infrastructure is being maintained."

The iron concentration is 0.29 milligrams per liter and the load of this metal is 3.94 pounds (1.79 kg) per day. The concentration of manganese is 11.81 milligrams per liter, with a daily load of 160 pounds (73 kg). The acidity concentration is 67.35 milligrams per liter and the alkalinity concentration is 2.77 milligrams per liter. The daily loads are 915 pounds (415 kg) and 37.6 pounds (17.1 kg), respectively.At its confluence with Drury Run, Whiskey Run has an aluminum concentration of 11.09 milligrams per liter and the daily load of aluminum is 16.65 pounds (7.55 kg).

The concentration of sulfates at the stream's headwaters is 5.8 milligrams per liter, but at the mouth the concentration is 67 milligrams per liter. The concentration of sulfates at the mouth of the tributary Stony Run is 271 milligrams per liter.As is typical for streams that begin in a bog, the first 1.0 mile (1.6 km) of Drury Run, near Tamarack Swamp, is stained brown from tannin in the stream. The presence of tannin causes the waters in the upper part of the stream to be slightly acidic. There is a high concentration of dissolved organic compounds in the stream.Drury Run experiences acid mine drainage, mostly in the final 3.5 miles (5.6 km). The tributary Stony Run is the most affected by acid mine drainage of all the tributaries of the stream.In 1990, the discharge of Drury Run upstream of Sandy Run's confluence with it ranged from 1,500 to 3,700 U.S. gallons (5,700 to 14,000 liters) per minute."

The branch was initially built as a single carriageway limited-access road, but the part between Kanfanar and Pazin was projected as a dual carriageway, so all the objects on the road are already prepared for a conversion to a motorway.\nThe most prominent feature of this branch of Istrian Y is the 5.4 km (3.4 mi) long U\u010dka Tunnel, the third longest tunnel in Croatia. The tunnel was opened in 1981 and is the main road that connects the Istrian peninsula with Rijeka and the rest of Croatia (and the only road for vehicles over 5 tonnes).

Basildon council had initially given permission for 40 English travellers to live on the site in the 1970s. The land was bought in 1996 by an Irish travelling family for \u00a3122,000 and after 2001 the population of 'Gypsy/Irish' 'travellers' started to grow, peaking at 675 in 2011 Many families started moving to Dale Farm in 2001, leading to legal disputes with Basildon council. In 2005, part of the site was declared illegal by inspectors, however, the 'traveller' community continued to oppose the council's decision, leading to a public enquiry being launched in 2006. This proved unsuccessful as in 2009 Lord Justice Pill ruled that the site was illegal. It was not until March 2011 that Basildon Council voted to go ahead with the eviction of 400 travellers living their illegally. The eviction itself took place on 19 October 2011. Altercations with the police from protesters led to the arrests of 45 people and 15 police officers injured. By the end of the day, the illegal section of the campsite had been cleared"

Under the LOI, the two organizations agreed to start a period of exclusive negotiations, with the goal of entering into final agreements by the end of the year. Their goal is to form a new organization through a joint operating company structure. Executives of both systems said a larger network would improve the ability to negotiate with insurance companies and provide other cost reductions. The letter of intent signed August 30, 2017 said that if the proposed partnership was approved, UNC Health Care CEO Bill Roper would become executive chairman and Carolinas Healthcare CEO Gene Woods would be CEO of the new organization. However, questions about who would control the combined system led Atrium to back out of talks in March 2018.On October 25, 2017, Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and High Point Regional Health System announced that Wake Forest Baptist would take over High Point Regional, a part of UNC Health since 2013, by Summer 2018.\n\n\n== References =="

At the top of the Hencote downhill gradient, freight trains of Class 5 (modern equivalent Class 7) such as this one were required to obey a stop sign, but the train passed the sign and entered the Coton Hill goods loop at speed.  \nDespite emergency brake applications being made, the train eventually derailed on the trap points at the exit of the goods yard and continued for a further 70 yards before finally crashing into the Coton Hill South signal box, destroying it completely. The first 11 wagons followed the locomotive, but the destruction of the signal box opened a set of points which sent 24 further wagons into a siding, where they derailed and some collided with a second Class 47 diesel which was waiting to leave the yard. The destruction was widespread and the cleanup operation was further hampered by hydrochloric acid leaking from a damaged wagon.  Normal service was not restored until 14 January."

However, the driver was found to be responsible for the accident, as had he stopped at the top of the incline, as was required, he would have been able to stop the train even if a brake failure had occurred.  The driver did not have any recollection of the accident, and it was thought logical that he had assumed that the points were set for the main line and not the goods loop.\nWhen the locomotive was being broken up some months later, it was found that its Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment had been isolated, despite appearing to be in working order.  The driver would therefore have had no warning that the points were set for the goods loop ahead, though given the failure to stop, this would probably not have prevented the accident."

It had a population of 25,939 at the 2011 census.\nFleetwood acquired its modern character in the 1830s, when the principal landowner Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, High Sheriff and MP, conceived an ambitious plan to re-develop the town to make it a busy seaport and railway spur. He commissioned the Victorian architect Decimus Burton to design a number of substantial civic buildings, including two lighthouses. Hesketh-Fleetwood's transport terminus schemes failed to materialise. The town expanded greatly in the first half of the 20th century with the growth of the fishing industry, and passenger ferries to the Isle of Man, to become a deep-sea fishing port.\nDecline of the fishing industry began in the 1960s, hastened by the Cod Wars with Iceland, though fish processing is still a major economic activity in Fleetwood. The town's most significant employer today is Lofthouse of Fleetwood, manufacturer of the lozenge Fisherman's Friend which is exported around the world."

There is also evidence of a Roman road running from Ribchester to Kirkham (12 miles (19 km) southeast of Fleetwood) which then makes a sharp turn to the northwest. Together, these suggest that Fleetwood may well have been the location of this Roman port. No direct evidence of the port has been found, but in 2007, an Iron Age settlement was discovered at Bourne Hill, just south of present-day Fleetwood, suggesting the area was populated in pre-Roman times.There is evidence that the eastern side of the River Wyre was occupied during the Danish invasions of the 9th and 10th centuries. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, the land on which Fleetwood now stands was part of the Hundred of Amounderness.\nA manor house at present-day Rossall, in the southwest of the town, was in the possession of the Allen family by the time of Henry VIII. The Allens were prominent Roman Catholics, and Henry VIII repossessed the land. Cardinal William Allen was born at the manor house in 1532. It was ultimately sold to Thomas Fleetwood, comptroller of the Royal Mint, whose son Edmund, expanded the house into Rossall Hall. The land remained in the Fleetwood family for 300 years."

From 1997 to 2010, Fleetwood was included with Thornton and parts of Blackpool, as part of the Blackpool North and Fleetwood parliamentary constituency. During that time the seat was held by Labour's Joan Humble. Prior to 1997, Fleetwood was part of the constituencies of Fylde North and Wyre, whose boundaries more closely matched those of Wyre Borough, and which consistently returned a Conservative member. In the 2015 general election a majority vote saw Fleetwood become a Labour town once again, represented by Cat Smith."

A government report in 2006 stated that three of the town's five wards fall into the 5% to 10% most deprived wards in England.The same government report noted that the demise of the fishing industry cost Fleetwood some 8,000 jobs, employment in fishing-related industries falling from 9,000 to less than 1,000, mostly in the fish-processing sector. The closure of the ICI Hillhouse works cost the region a further 4,500 jobs. Industrial and commercial development has been at a standstill for fifteen years and only a single commercial employer based in the town has more than 200 employees. The stock of both commercial and residential property is in decline.While Wyre Borough in general has a lower unemployment rate than the rest of the United Kingdom, Fleetwood's is considerably higher. Using figures indicating benefit claimants as a percentage of total population (usually considered to be about half the 'actual' unemployment rate) the figures for August 2007 are:\n Average household income in August 2007 was as follows:The town's largest and most prominent single employer is Lofthouse's of Fleetwood Ltd., manufacturers of Fisherman's Friend\u2014a menthol lozenge popular worldwide and especially in Japan.\nIn July 2007, a new \"Masterplan\" for revitalizing the town around a \"vibrant waterfront and a revitalised town centre\" was submitted to the Wyre Borough Council. Some of the funding would come from an EU cash grant. The Masterplan was funded by Wyre Council, the Northwest Development Agency and English Heritage. The plan has three main areas for development:\n\nTransport: Improvements to the A585 link road. Restoration of the railway link including a new railway station in Fleetwood. Improved links to the riverside coastal paths and Fleetwood Marsh Nature Reserve.\n\"Seafront scene transformation\": new waterfront environment with housing, beach sports, family area and bigger entertainment attractions. The original plan placed housing on land opposite the Mount Hotel on land currently used as a nine-hole pitch and putt course, but, after opposition from residents, this part of the plan was dropped. The waterfront would have a discovery and entertainment centre focused around a re-fashioned Marine Hall, with better health and fitness facilities nearby.\n\"Attractive new look for centre\": the Masterplan includes plans for more open spaces and more national name shops on Lord Street, with Albert Square and Station Road earmarked as public squares. A new landmark square and heart of the town is proposed on both Lord Street and London Street with cafes, bars and restaurants."

It is about 12 miles (19 km) from Fleetwood to the southern terminus at Starr Gate, and about 8 miles (13 km) to Talbot Square, Blackpool. There are 10 tram stops in the town, the southernmost being Rossall School. Trams run the full length of both Lord Street and North Albert Street, undivided from regular road traffic. Bus service to Blackpool is provided by Blackpool Transport and Stagecoach North West, who also provide services to Preston and other local destinations.\nThere are frequent passenger ferry sailings from Fleetwood across the River Wyre to Knott End-on-Sea via the Wyre Estuary Ferry.\nPassenger sailings to Douglas are not currently on a regular timetable. Ferries were operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company from 1876 to 1961, and again periodically from 1971. However, in recent years the service has been restricted to once or twice per year. From 2004, Stena Line provided some passenger accommodation on its thrice daily service to Larne in Northern Ireland. However, Stena Line withdrew the service at the end of 2010.The town being built on a peninsula, for many years there were only two roads into and out of Fleetwood: Broadway, through Cleveleys, designated as the A587, and Fleetwood Road, through Thornton, designated as the A585. To cater for container traffic, Amounderness Way was built in the late 1970s and re-designated as the A585. In the 1990s, Amounderness Way was extended further into the town to the end of Dock Street (the entrance to the Freeport shopping village) along the former railway bed.\nThe town was for several years the northern Fylde terminus of the railway line to London, hence the hotel opposite the site of the now demolished Fleetwood railway station is called the North Euston Hotel. The line also carried landed fish from the docks to distant markets. There has been no railway service to Fleetwood since 1970. Poulton-le-Fylde and Blackpool North are the nearest railway stations. However, the line to Poulton is still present, and plans remain to re-open the line in the future. In June 2021 a feasibility study was submitted by the Lancashire County Council to the Department for Transport to re-open the line from Fleetwood to Poulton-le-Fylde, under the government's Restoring Your Railway programme."

Estate of Baniachong was so vast it crisscrossed all districts of Sylhet region as well as the greater Mymensingh, Dhaka and Comilla.In accordance with the Pargana system introduced by Murshid Quli Khan in 1722, Anwar Khan claimed tenure of 28 Parganas of Muazzamabad, but his claim was rejected after an investigation by the revenue office, as these Parganas belong to the posterity of Shah Muazzam Uddin Qureshi, who assumed the name of Muazzam Khan when he ascended the throne of Muazzamabad.\nHence, these 28 Parganas: Banshikunda (Vamshikunda), Ranadigha, Shelvarsh, Sukhaid, B\u00e9taal, Palash, Laxmanshree, Chamtala, Pagla (Paragala), Dohaliya, Bazu Jatua, Sinchapaid, Shafahar (Shaharpara), Sik Sonaita (Sonauta), Atuajan (Atuajahan), Aatgaon, Kuwazpur, Joar Baniyachung,  Kasba Baniyachung, Jalsuka, Bithangal, Joanshahi, Mudaikaid (Mudakadi), Kuresha, Jantari (Yantri), Haveli Sonaita, Satar Sati and Paikuda, were allotted to new landholders that created numerous zamindars and taluquedars in former Muazzamabad (districts of Sunamganj and Habiganj).\nThe history of the battle between Anwar Khan and his brother Hussain Khan (Bara Bhuiyans of Baniachang) with the Mughal army in the first decade of the seventeenth century is found in the Baharistan-i-Gayebi. Zamindars of Banyachung was renowned for their generosity, but the last zamindar was more than generous; he was well known for his  gullibility and his aged but adept and calculating servants such as dewans and chaudharies swindled him left, right and centre.  By the time of the retirement, dewans and chauddharies working for Banyachung zamindar ended up holding more lands than the zamindar himself. This was achieved through a severance scheme conjured up by a shrewd dewan; this scheme made the zamindar honour-bound to grant land (taluque) to his servants on retirement and there were two categories of taluque: (i) Khalisa and (ii) Mujrahi, aka Mujrai. The first category of taluque, i.e. Khalisa, was reserved for the male servants and the second category of taluque, i.e. Mujrai, was reserved for zamindar's courtesans.  This scheme ruined the zamindary of Baniyachung within a very short span of time and created numerous Khalisadar and Mujraidar in the region, who nowadays style themselves as chowdhury in Sylhet region."

By 1872, shipping trade had increased so that more capacity was required and the Great Eastern Railway obtained permission to reclaim land at Ray Farm, a mile to the west of Harwich, and build a new quay. This new quay was opened in 1883 by Charles H. Parkes, the Chairman of the Great Eastern Railway company, the port being named after him as Parkeston Quay. The port had its own railway station, and a hotel was built between the northern platform and the quay; the hotel building is now used as offices. The railway station was originally called Parkeston Quay, but was renamed Harwich Parkeston Quay in 1934 when the new Parkeston Quay West station was opened to serve the west end of the quay. It was given its current name, Harwich International, in 1995.The port remained under the ownership of the Great Eastern Railway until 1923 when the company became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). In 1939 the Admiralty requisitioned Parkeston Quay for naval purposes, naming it HMS Badger. It was released back to the LNER in 1946.\nOn 1 January 1948 the LNER was nationalised and the port came under the ownership of British Railways (BR). In 1984, as part of the privatisation of BR's Sealink ferry services, the port was sold to Sealink's new owners Sea Containers, which sold it on to Stena Line in 1989.

The appropriate electoral ward is called 'Portman' with naturally the most populous area being south of the river. The ward includes Bryanston School and also runs south west almost to Thornicombe. The total ward population at the abovementioned census was 2,436.Blandford St Mary has a busy Tesco supermarket and fuel station and a Homebase DIY store which attracts shoppers from the many villages that surround the Blandford area. In addition there are a number of offices in Stour Park. In the residential area there is a new housing estate and  primary school. An older area of the village near the river bridge to Blandford Forum has a traditional public house and a village green. Opposite is the old stone gate at the entrance of the Bryanston School estate. Outline planning permission has been given to redevelop the Hall & Woodhouse brewery site to include new offices and 200 new homes.\nLower Blandford St Mary is a rural outpost of Blandford St Mary, in the farm fields to the south across the bypass road, with a small church and graveyard, and one or two historic houses.\nThe Dorset Central Railway, which opened on 1 November 1860 from the LSWR station at Wimborne, had a station in the village, serving the neighbouring important market town of Blandford Forum. This was demolished when the line amalgamated to be part of the Somerset & Dorset Railway, and a bridge was built over the river Stour to the station at Blandford."

Property of 71 acres for the university and roughly 530 acres for the surrounding neighborhood was platted from land owned by pioneer families and sold at half-value to the Methodist Episcopal Church, then owners of Willamette University in Salem. The church planned to sell individual lots through a realty company in University Park to finance the university, but home site sales did not sustain the institution. A financial failure for most of its brief existence, the university closed in 1900.After Portland University closed, the land and buildings were purchased by the Archdiocese of Portland in 1901, and Columbia University opened on the site, later renamed the University of Portland. Public transportation was installed, and industry began to develop in the area.\nAs designers of University Park, Methodist Episcopal officials aligned streets along a northeast \u2013 southwest axis and a northwest \u2013 southeast axis in order to maximize exposure to sunlight. Church officials also chose street names in remembrance not only of institutions of higher learning but also persons and places important to Methodists of the time. As a result, University Park is a neighborhood without an ordinal relationship among streets; therefore, navigation requires knowledge of all streets."

The airport is located in an unincorporated area of Orange County, and it is owned and operated by the county. John Wayne Airport is surrounded by the cities of Irvine, Newport Beach, and Costa Mesa, although its IATA airport code and mailing address are both registered to Santa Ana, the county seat. Originally named Orange County Airport, the Orange County Board of Supervisors renamed the airport in 1979 in honor of actor John Wayne, who lived in neighboring Newport Beach and died that year. A statue of John Wayne was installed at the airline terminal in 1982.John Wayne Airport is the sole commercial airport in Orange County. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011\u20132015 categorized it as a primary commercial service airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings per year. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 4,584,147 enplanements in calendar year 2014, an increase from 4,450,628 in 2013. In 2014, John Wayne Airport was the second busiest airport in the Greater Los Angeles area (by passenger count) with over 9 million total passengers. As of 2023, the largest airlines at John Wayne Airport were Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Alaska Airlines.\nIn addition to the airline terminal, several facilities at the airport serve the general aviation and corporate aviation community. General aviation operations outnumber commercial operations. The only other general aviation airport in Orange County is Fullerton Municipal Airport.\nJohn Wayne Airport has two runways. The main runway, 2L/20R, at 5,700 feet (1,700 m) in length, is one of the shortest of any major airport in the United States, and passenger jetliners operating from the airport have never been larger than the Boeing 757 (although some larger cargo aircraft fly from SNA, such as the widebody Airbus A300 operated by FedEx). Runway 2R/20L is 2,887 feet (880 m) long and serves general aviation aircraft. No widebody passenger jetliners have ever been operated into SNA in scheduled airline service."

It was purchased through a land swap by the County of Orange in 1939 and remains under the county's ownership and management.\nMartin added the first hangar to his airfield in 1926. In 1935 Howard Hughes staged his world speed record-setting flight from the Eddie Martin Airport.\nAt some point between 1940-41, the new Orange County Airport was established on land adjacent to Martin Field, to the south.\nThe two fields were not located on the same property, as has been repeated elsewhere.\nBut flight operations at the new Orange County Airport probably resulted in the closure of Martin Field at this point.After serving as a military base during World War II, the Santa Ana Army Airfield was returned by the federal government to the county with the stipulation that it remain open to all kinds of aviation uses.\n\nIn addition to continuing to serve aviation, the field became an important drag racing center. From 1950 to 1959, C.J. \"Pappy\" Hart and Creighton Hunter operated the Santa Ana Drag Strip, credited for being the world's first commercial drag strip, on the airport runway every Sunday, when it was closed to air traffic.\nThe original single runway was 4,800 feet (1,500 m) long, on a magnetic heading of 210 degrees (Runway 21) and 30 degrees (Runway 3). In 1964 the airport was rebuilt, with its present two parallel runway configuration, oriented 190/10 degrees magnetic. The longer runway, 19R (now 20R), at 5,701 feet (1,738 m), is only 901 feet (275 m) longer than the old Runway 21 but long enough to accommodate jet airliners. A full instrument landing system (ILS) was also installed.\nIn the 1950s, the only airline flights were Bonanza's few flights between Los Angeles and Phoenix, via San Diego. In 1963 Bonanza started nonstop F27s to Phoenix, and to Las Vegas in 1965; in 1967 Air California started Electra nonstops to San Francisco, 48 flights a week each way. The first scheduled jet flights were Bonanza DC-9s later in 1967. From 1967 through 1980, Air California (later renamed AirCal) and Bonanza and its successors, Air West and Hughes Airwest, had a duopoly at the airport, until the FAA ruled this illegal.In 1967, the 22,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) Eddie Martin Terminal was built to accommodate 400,000 annual passengers. Remodeling added two passenger holding areas in 1974, a new baggage claim area in 1980 and a terminal annex building in 1982, bringing the facility to 29,000 square feet (2,700 m2).\nNonstop flights reached Salt Lake City in 1976\u201377 (Hughes DC-9s), Denver in 1982 (Frontier MD-80s), Dallas/Fort Worth in 1983 (American MD-80s), Chicago\u2013O'Hare in 1986 (AirCal 737-300s), and New York\u2013Kennedy in 1991 (America West 757-200s).\n\nAfter the Orange County Airport was renamed John Wayne Airport on June 20, 1979, the John Wayne Associates commissioned sculptor Robert Summers to create a bronze statue of \"the Duke\". The 9-foot (2.7 m) statue, created at Hoka Hey Foundry in Dublin, Texas, was dedicated to the County on November 4, 1982. Today, the bronze statue is in the Thomas F. Riley Terminal on the Arrival Level.\n\nIn 1990, the Thomas F. Riley Terminal opened. The aging 29,000-square-foot (2,700 m2) Eddie Martin Terminal was replaced with a modern 337,900-square-foot (31,390 m2) facility. The new facility included 14 loading bridges, four baggage carousels, wide-open spaces and distinct roadside arrival and departure levels. In 1994, the then-unused Eddie Martin Terminal was demolished.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, a new, larger airport was proposed for the nearby site of the then recently closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. However, after a series of political battles, combined with significant opposition from residents in the vicinity of El Toro, the proposal was defeated, and no new airport was built.\nIn 2011, additional terminal space was added and existing terminals were refreshed as part of a $543 million expansion project. A new Terminal C with six additional gates was built along with dedicated commuter gate areas in the new Terminal C and new commuter facilities in Terminal A. A new parking lot C was added along with additional support facilities such as a Central Utility plant.\nIn June 2020, an airport name change was requested, due to comments John Wayne made, believed to be in support of white supremacy to Playboy in a 1971 interview.In September 2020, Orange County officials have planned to end all of JSX operations at SNA on January 1, 2021, stating it is \"no longer welcomed\". This announcement prompted the airline to seek support from customers, encouraging them to contact the Orange County officials for reconsideration in order for the airline to continue operations at Orange County. Since December 2020, the airline has filed a lawsuit against the airport, stating that it has \"refused to offer any accommodations\" to the airline. It stated that the airport \"discriminatorily chose\" to terminate the airline's operations at SNA \"in favor of two large airlines [Spirit and Allegiant Airlines]...\" which the former already operates the same flights to Las Vegas, Reno, and Oakland. Shortly afterwards, the airline won a temporary restraining order, preventing the airport officials from terminating the airline's operations in which a spokeswoman said the airport will comply."

        "content": "A 1985 settlement agreement defined the scope of operation for John Wayne Airport in how it affects the local community. The area that lies directly south of John Wayne Airport is considered a noise-sensitive area. The agreement in conjunction with a Phase 2 Commercial Airline Access Plan and Regulation controls the number of noisier operations (mainly commercial aircraft) allowed from the airport. Noise abatement enforcement is carried out with the aid of 10 permanent noise monitoring stations. These stations are placed in areas that exceed a community noise equivalent level (CNEL) of 65 dB. Noise reports are published by the airport and are available to the public.The takeoff procedure at John Wayne Airport is unique because of the local noise restrictions and short runway. When using the typical traffic pattern (departures from runway 20R) most commercial airliners cycle to full power (95\u201397%) while holding at the end of the runway then release the brakes when engines are fully spooled up. Pilots must make a steep 25 degree climb to 500 to 700 feet (150\u2013210 m), where engine power is reduced to reduce noise. Pilots must also make a left turn after departure to 175 degrees to enter a corridor over the city of Newport Beach where the noise was deemed to be the least disruptive. These procedures have led passengers to rate John Wayne Airport as one of the nation's scariest.Departures from 2L (normally during Santa Ana wind conditions) are not affected by these noise abatement procedures. Landings are also typically on runway 20R and almost always include full flap extensions and the use of full reverse thrust. Extension of the runway is almost impossible, as both ends are bounded by freeways along with numerous residences and businesses.\nThe county prohibits commercial departures between 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM (8:00 AM on Sundays) and commercial arrivals between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM (8:00 AM on Sundays). Exceptions can be made for an emergency, mechanical, air traffic control, or weather delay, which is beyond the airline's control. Curfew exceptions by carrier are published by the airport and are available to the public."

The crew was cleared for a visual approach to Runway 19R while the controller had cleared a smaller plane to take off from 19R. Upon realizing that the landing aircraft might overtake the departing one, the controller ordered the flight to go around and the other aircraft to abort its takeoff, which it did. The captain of the landing Air California aircraft delayed the go-around then initiated a gear up procedure before a positive rate of climb was achieved, causing the plane to stall. The 737 then banked left at low altitude causing the left wingtip to make contact with the runway. Then the nose came down, striking the ground, and the airplane spun around and skidded down the runway before coming to rest in the margin. A fire started, but the passengers and crew exited the plane. Of the passengers, four sustained serious injuries, and 29 suffered minor injuries. The aircraft, registered N468AC, was damaged beyond repair and was written off.On December 15, 1993, a chartered IAI Westwind business jet carrying two flight crew members and three passengers (including Rich Snyder, president of In-N-Out Burger), crashed while on approach to John Wayne Airport. All five occupants were killed in the crash. The aircraft, which departed Brackett Field, 30 miles to the north in La Verne, followed a Boeing 757 for landing, became caught in the 757's wake turbulence, rolled into a deep descent, and crashed near the intersection of State Route 55 and Edinger Avenue. The crash investigation led to the FAA requirement for an adequate period between heavy aircraft and following light aircraft to allow wake turbulence to diminish.On February 13, 2017, Harrison Ford accidentally landed his Aviat Husky on taxiway C, to the left of runway 20L.  A Boeing 737 was holding short of 20L on the taxiway when Ford overflew them.On June 30, 2017, a Cessna 310 twin-engine aircraft crashed short of a runway into a highway median on Interstate 405. The pilot made a mayday call shortly after taking off from John Wayne Airport and attempted to land after being cleared for emergency landing on runway 20R. Two people on board were injured in the crash.On August 5, 2018, a Cessna 414 scheduled to land at John Wayne Airport crashed into a Staples parking lot a few blocks north of the airport in nearby Santa Ana, killing at least five people.On January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky S-76B helicopter took off from John Wayne Airport at approximately 9:06 am PST carrying retired NBA basketball player Kobe Bryant along with his 13-year-old daughter, and 7 others bound for Camarillo Airport for a basketball event in Thousand Oaks. En route, the helicopter crashed into a hillside in Calabasas south of U.S. Route 101, killing everyone on board. The helicopter had been seen in distress under heavy fog, according to witnesses. The cause of the crash was pilot error and spatial disorientation.On the evening of August 20, 2021, an unauthorized person bypassed security and gained access to the tarmac near Terminal C, prompting a lockdown of the airport. The suspect took control of a ground crew vehicle and drove it around before abandoning it and re-entering the terminal. Police later discovered the suspect hiding in an attic space inside the terminal and took him into custody.On August 20, 2023, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-800 under the registration N516AS suffered landing gear damage after a rough landing upon arrival at John Wayne Airport during Tropical Storm Hilary. The flight, AS1288, originated from Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport. A video of the landing filmed from inside the cabin and posted online showed a commotion among the passengers and sparks on the runway from the plane. No injuries were reported.On November 20, 2023, a Cessna 172 taxiing on a runway was flipped over on its high wings by the Santa Ana winds.

The land eventually came to belong to the Sterling Iron Works, which mined and shipped iron ore from a number of sites within the park. The last of the mines was closed in the 1920s.  By the mid-1990s the Sterling Forest Corporation, a subsidiary of Trygg-Hansa, a Swedish insurance company, held title to 17,500 acres of the forest.  The corporation was actively pursuing development of the property, proposing construction of 14,500 residential units and 7.4 million square feet of commercial and light industrial space.  At risk was a largely undeveloped habitat of eastern hardwood forest, lakes, and streams in the nation's most densely populated metropolitan region.  \nPublic advocacy for conservation of Sterling Forest had existed since the 1950s, but without success.  By the 1990s, this advocacy was centered on the Public/Private Partnership to Save Sterling Forest, a coalition of twenty-nine New York and New Jersey nonprofit organizations chaired by Robert O. Binnewies, Executive Director of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.  The Public/Private Partnership worked for almost a decade to secure funding commitments from the federal government, the State of New Jersey, the State of New York, and private sources to achieve acquisition of most Sterling Forest Corporation holdings.  In 1998, The Trust for Public Land and the Open Space Institute negotiated a purchase on behalf of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission of 15,805 acres of corporate holdings for $55 million.  Governors George Pataki (NY) and Christine Todd Whitman (NJ) jointly announced that Sterling Forest State Park was established.Among additional acquisitions subsequent to establishment, in November 1999, The Trust for Public Land and the Open Space Institute succeeded in purchasing 659 acres from New York University for inclusion in the park.In December 2000, The Trust for Public Land and the Open Space Institute negoitiated for the purchase of 1,065 acres from the Sterling Forest Corporation to expand Sterling Forest State Park.In 2005, The Trust for Public Land in conjunction with the State of New York Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation purchased a 90-acre farm in Warwick, NY to add to the state park.In 2006, the park was expanded yet again after a 575-acre (2.33 km2) tract in the center of the forest known as Sterling Forge came on the market.  Sterling Forest LLC developers planned to construct 107 luxury homes and an 18-hole golf course on the tract.  Concerned members of the public rallied and were able to procure the tract for the state park. The final $13.5 million sale price was negotiated by The Trust for Public Land, funded through the State of New York Environmental Protection Fund. and private contributions.\nIn February 2021, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the addition of another 112 acres to the state park, resulting from a partnership with the Orange County Land Trust.These and other acquisitions have resulted in Palisades Interstate Park Commission holdings of 21,938 acres at Sterling Forest.  Residential and commercial development no longer threaten negative impact to the natural ecosystem.\nPublic outdoor recreation is the predominant use.  \nFunding for various acquisitions, beginning with the purchase in 1998 of 15,805 acres, have included the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, the Victoria Foundation, the Trust for Public Land, the State of New York, the State of New Jersey, the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, the federal government, and contributions from private individuals."

However, prior to the Japanese occupation, the name had been rendered in hanja as \u9c32\u5c71, meaning \"soft-shelled turtle mountain.\" Because of the complexity of the \u9c32 (\"o\") character, and because crows were abundant in the area, the Japanese changed the name to \u70cf\u5c71, meaning \"crow mountain school.\""

        "content": "Founded in 1966 by Donald E. Benson's Mighty-Mac Broadcasting Company, WIDG was just the second radio station to launch in the Eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan (following WSOO in Sault Ste. Marie.) The station was known for many years as \"Widge by the Bridge\" and aired mainly middle of the road music, at times a blend of top 40.\nThe nickname \"Widge by the Bridge\" was coined by a longtime friend of station founder Donald E. Benson, a Lansing-based dentist who thought WITL-Lansing's slogan \"Whittle while you work\" was something that WIDG needed.  The original CP for the station had the call letters WSTI, \"St. Ignace\" but Benson felt the call letters looked like \"Stye\". In the late 1970s, Benson obtained a construction permit for an FM station that would become WMKC.\nConstruction on the new FM station began shortly after the license was granted on July 30, 1979; and in December of that same year, Benson also obtained a dark license for WIDG and kept the station dark until April 1981, when he was required to return WIDG to the air in order for WMKC to come on the air.  WIDG returned with an MOR format until a format change to Big Band and standards and the call letters WLVM (\"We Love Michigan\", with the station's music format provided by TM's \"TMOR\" package). In 1985, the station returned to the WIDG calls with a top 40 oldies format until 1988, when WIDG simulcast sister FM's WMKC St. Ignace and WCKC-Cadillac's country music format.\nEventually, in the early 1990s, WIDG once again adopted separate programming from WMKC, airing first oldies (as \"Cool 940\") and then classic country (as \"Classic KC Country\") before the sports-talk format was introduced. WIDG was initially an affiliate of One-on-One Sports (which later became Sporting News Radio) before switching to the ESPN Radio feed.\nWIDG operates with an omnidirectional antenna and with very low power after local sunset to avoid interference with the now-defunct CINW (formerly CBC Radio-owned CBM) in Montreal. In WIDG's heyday, it constantly fought for a good signal into the north and was stymied by 10 kW CKCY/920 Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.  WIDG's signal was obliterated by CKCY north of Rudyard.  When CKCY went dark, WIDG finally got the full potential of its 5 kW signal and can be heard well into the province of Ontario.\nThough CINW (the former CBC Radio-owned CBM) has been silent since 2010, WIDG must still power down from 5,000 watts to 4 watts at sunset per FCC rules.\nOn December 11, 2019, WIDG and its sister stations were acquired by Immaculate Heart Media, bringing Relevant Radio programming to Northern Michigan."

Britain also retained the Spanish ports of Gibraltar and Mah\u00f3n, captured during the War of the Spanish Succession.When Elisabeth Farnese became Philip's second wife in 1714, he already had two sons who were next in line for the Spanish throne. She wanted to create an Italian inheritance for her own children, while Philip viewed regaining these territories as important for his prestige. Spain re-occupied Sardinia unopposed in 1717 but a landing on Sicily in 1718 led to the War of the Quadruple Alliance. The Royal Navy's victory at Cape Passaro in August isolated the Spanish invasion force and ultimately forced them to surrender to Austrian troops in 1719.In the 1720 Treaty of The Hague, Spain renounced its Italian possessions, in return for a guarantee Parma would go to Elisabeth's eldest son Charles on the death of the childless Duke of Parma. The new British monarch, George I, agreed to raise the question of returning Gibraltar in Parliament 'at a favourable opportunity.' Frustration at the lack of progress on this and commercial tensions led to the 1727 to 1729 Anglo-Spanish War.Military action was primarily limited to an attack on Porto Bello, Panama by the British and an unsuccessful siege of Gibraltar by Spain, who also imposed restrictions on British merchants. The two countries agreed a truce in February 1728; hoping to deter Spain from an alliance with Austria, British envoy Benjamin Keene negotiated the Treaty of El Pardo in March. Considered too lenient by London, the agreement was repudiated, leading to the Congress of Soissons. There the British negotiated with a position of strength - a strategy that proved successful; most notably preventing a Spanish-Austrian alliance against Britain."

Another was the 1716 Anglo-French Alliance; although both sides grew increasingly suspicious of each other, the succession of George I in 1714 and his concern for Hanover made this more important to Britain than previously. Emperor Charles VI wanted the other Powers to support the 1713 Pragmatic Sanction and thus ensure the succession of his daughter Maria Theresa. Commercial issues included the Austrian-owned Ostend Company, which competed for the East Indies trade with British, French and Dutch merchants, as well as Spanish concerns over British incursions in New Spain.The result was an almost continuous series of conferences and agreements, including the 1720 to 1724 Congress of Cambrai and the 1721 Treaty of Madrid. The 1725 Peace of Vienna between Austria and Spain was followed by the Treaty of Hanover, signed by France, Britain, Hanover and Prussia. Europe was on the verge of a general war, avoided when French chief minister Cardinal Fleury invited Austria, France and Britain to the Congress of Soissons, although Spain was excluded.Trading privileges for British and French merchants in Cadiz were restored and compensation paid for losses, with an Anglo-Spanish commission established to discuss commercial issues in the Americas. Britain and France supported the rights of Elisabeth's son Charles to Parma, with the addition of the Duchy of Tuscany; Spain could also send 6,000 troops to garrison the duchies in advance. These terms were presented to the Spanish, who signed on 9 November, the Dutch Republic joining the Treaty on 29th."

As a result of the 1733 to 1735 War of the Polish Succession, he exchanged it for the Kingdom of Naples and in 1759 became king of Spain.Anglo-Spanish tensions increased with the founding of the British colony of Georgia in 1732, which Spain considered a threat to Spanish Florida, vital to protect shipping routes with mainland Spain. For their part, the British viewed the 1733 Pacte de Famille between Louis XV and his uncle Philip as the first step in being replaced by France as Spain's largest trading partner. These ultimately led first to the War of Jenkins' Ear in 1739, then the 1740 to 1748 War of the Austrian Succession."

        "content": "Originally the property of the Earl of Huntingdon (c. 1750), father of Steele's Aspasia, who built a mansion here, the property passed through various hands into those of The 1st Viscount Cremorne (1725\u20131813), an Irish peer from County Monaghan, who greatly beautified it.The name Cremorne is the name of a barony, an old administrative unit, in County Monaghan in Ireland. It is an Anglicisation of what in modern Irish is Cr\u00edoch Mh\u00farn. This roughly translates as the 'Bounds of Mourne', from the territorial domain of an ancient clan or sept called Mughdorna in Old Irish. The name is cognate with the Mountains of Mourne.\nThe property was sold by the Dawson family, Barons Cremorne, in 1831 to a Baron de Berenger, who was a convicted fraudster whose real name was Charles Random. De Berenger converted the site into a sports facility, called The Stadium, and became a proponent of self-defence techniques.  The business failed in 1843, but not before de Berenger had added some attractions of pleasure gardens of the time, including hosting a balloon ascent in 1838. For two years the gardens opened for summer, including an opening festival billed as \"Pie de Nie\" with Balloon ascent, for instance, were held, and the property was sold in 1845.  James Ellis took over the license in January 1845. The twelve-acre site was then developed by James Ellis into a proprietary place of entertainment and spectacle, being popular as such from 1845 to 1877. The Cremorne Gardens occupied a large site running between the Thames and the King's Road. Opened in 1845, they were noisy and colourful pleasure gardens featuring restaurants, entertainments, dancing and balloon ascents, and could be entered from the north gate on Kings Road or another by the Cremorne Pier on the river.\n\nEdward Tyrrel Smith paid Pauline Violante to attempt to cross the Thames in Albanian costume on 12 August 1861. A wire that was too slack meant that she failed at the first attempt but she succeeded at her second try. She walked from Battersea Bridge to the Cremorne Gardens, watched by 20,000 people. Carlo Valerio would die in another tight rope demonstration at Cremorne Gardens.The famous artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler painted several nocturnes of Cremorne Gardens between 1872 and 1877.  He was a resident of Cheyne Walk, a mere few hundred yards from the Gardens. His painting Cremorne Gardens No 2 is full of fashionable and active figures and parallels to some extent the \u2018modern life\u2019 paintings of his French associates Manet and Tissot with whom he was in close contact during the early 1870s. Cremorne Gardens was doubtless a most attractive location, not only for its light displays but also for the brilliant array of fashionable people who gathered there. They provided the setting for Nocturne in Black and Gold: the Firewheel and Nocturne in Black and Gold: the Falling Rocket of c.1874, the latter resulting in the Whistler versus Ruskin trial of 1878.\nWalter Greaves was the son of a Chelsea boatbuilder who used to ferry Turner across the river; Walter and his brother Harry also performed the same service for Whistler, and in about 1863 became his unpaid studio assistants and pupils. They adored Whistler, accompanied him wherever he went, imitated his dress and manner, made the frames for his canvases, bought his materials and prepared his colours. Walter said; \"He taught us to paint, and we taught him the waterman\u2019s jerk\". Their close association lasted well into the 1890s, Whistler favouring Walter as he was the more gifted of the two brothers. Two of his most successful images were Regatta at Hammersmith Bridge and Chelsea under Snow; like Whistler he concentrated on areas around the Thames. He died in poverty, having been taken in by the Charterhouse.\nGreaves chooses to depict Whistler near the Crystal Platform. A reporter in the Illustrated London News (30 May 1857) admired the structure's \"inclosing ironwork...enriched, by Defries and Son, with devices in emerald and garnet cut-glass drops, and semicircles of lustre and gas jets, which have a most brilliant effect.\" The pavilion was about three hundred and sixty feet in circumference. It was encrusted with ornamental pillars, gas jets, and over forty plate-glass mirrors in black frames. In the upper portion of the pagoda (seen here), where the orchestra played, there were seventeen gas lit chandeliers.\nThis particular feature of the Gardens was clearly a favourite with Greaves as he chose to depict it on several occasions, for example The Dancing Platform, Cremorne Gardens (1870s) and in an etching of this period, which depicts the same view as Whistler in the Cremorne Gardens. In the former Whistler is depicted as the natty flaneur, striding along with and yet separate from the crowd. In the latter Whistler is seated but maintains the image of flaneur, the impartial, non-judgmental observer of contemporary life. He leans to one side to acknowledge a fellow dandy, much to the impatience of the young woman who stands at his table. Cremorne Gardens rapidly acquired a reputation as the territory of the demi-monde frequented by women of questionable morals. His associate could buy such a woman; this is implied by his indifference towards her, the attention of the passing woman as well as the undisguised stare of the gentleman at the railing.  \nWhistler and the Greaves family were frequent visitors before the gardens closed in 1877.  Cremorne Gardens never acquired the fashionable fame of Vauxhall Gardens, and finally became so great an annoyance to some of the more influential residents in the neighbourhood that a renewal of its licence was refused, and most of the site of the gardens was soon built over. The name survives in Cremorne Road.Donald James Wheal, in his first-person memoir of life in working-class Chelsea,  World's End gives a lively account of the almost-forgotten history and destruction of Cremorne Gardens."

Thames Water originally proposed that an access road cut straight through Cremorne Gardens. [1]\nCremorne Gardens secured a Green Flag award for the first time in 2010 as one of the best green spaces in England.  Councillor Nicholas Paget-Brown, Cabinet Member for Environment and Leisure Services, attended the flag raising ceremony at Cremorne Gardens at the end of July along with the mayor of Kensington and Chelsea, Councillor James Husband. [2]\nLocal Conservative Kensington and Chelsea Councillors and residents have promised to try to save the Gardens from use as an access road to build the Thames Tunnel. [3].  Phil Stride representing Thames Water stated \"We are happy to work with the council to use whatever access route they can help us find.\"  Early in 2011, the Lots Road Waste Centre owned by the council ceased operation.  The former Waste Centre is closer to the proposed Tideway Tunnel, therefore is an alternative site for the access road.  However, Cremorne Gardens is still listed as the preferred site on the Thames Water website even though it is the council's decision. [4]\nIn 2014, Cremorne Gardens was again under threat from the local council which suggested to Transport For London that there be a \"Chelsea West\" station on Kings Road near World's End and on the site of the Cremorne Estate for Crossrail Two.  Cremorne Gardens would have been destroyed to use as the building site for the station.  After a huge outcry from residents, the council abandoned its support for Chelsea West."

It lies by the source of the River Tame, high amongst the Pennines above the village of Delph, 4.6 miles (7.4 km) northeast of Oldham,3.3 miles (5.3 km) north-northwest of Uppermill and Shaw and Crompton. It has a population of around 500.Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Denshaw and its surroundings have provided archaeological evidence of Stone and Bronze Age activity in the area. The name Denshaw is of Old Norse derivation, and the oldest part of the village is an ancient hamlet.Built up around the junction of five major roads, until the 20th century, Denshaw consisted mainly of smallholdings and a few public houses such as the Junction Inn, originally built as a coaching house for travellers. Denshaw is noted for its annual Whit Friday brass band contest."

        "content": "There is evidence of Stone Age activity around Denshaw; in 2004 Saddleworth Archaeological Trust objected to the construction of a wind farm on a site on Denshaw Moor which had produced more than 200 Mesolithic artefacts. Human activity in Denshaw continued in the Bronze Age, as demonstrated by the discovery of a palstave on Wall Green in 1932, when a trench was being dug for a water pipe, and some tools from Denshaw Moor, on the site of the proposed wind farm, which include a ceremonial flint dagger. A Roman road may also cross the site.The name Denshaw is derived from Old Norse, suggesting a settlement may have existed there during the period of the Danelaw. Denshaw Fold, the oldest part of the village, is an isolated hamlet of ancient origin. Many of the traditional stone dwellings are listed buildings and are descendants of the cluster of houses first built in the locality during the 16th century. Around 1795, the Junction Inn at Denshaw was erected. It served as a posting house on the Ripponden-to-Oldham turnpike road (opened in 1798) for the changing of horses and the provision of refreshments.\nDenshaw did not experience the same rate of urbanisation and industrialisation as its surrounding settlements during the Industrial Revolution, and it did not become a mill town or a centre of the local cotton mill boom as did nearby Rochdale, Milnrow and Oldham. However, Denshaw Vale was a calico printing factory which was \"an important concern that employed a workforce of 150\" during the 19th century. Furthermore, Denshaw was chosen as the site of a reservoir which local mills were to contribute monies and thereby use; In 1828, Rackenden Deign Reservoir was built by Denshaw to provide for 24 watermills. In 1818 an Oddfellows Lodge was erected in the village. In 1887, Denshaw was documented having a population of 1,279.In 2003, energy company E.ON UK proposed the installation of seven 350-foot (107 m) wind turbines at Denshaw. This was met with opposition from the local and wider communities, culminating in the Saddleworth Moors Action Group, who were joined by environmentalist David Bellamy. The council received over 1,000 letters objecting to the proposed wind farm, and although initially accepted by the former Liberal Democrat local authority, the application was rejected by Labour-controlled Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council on 1 March 2006.On 23 May 2007, Denshaw's post office (which doubled-up as the village's only shop) was the centre of a robbery. The \"tiny premises\" had been under threat of closure owing to Post Office's modernisation plans and has since closed.\nOn 17 April 2008, local, national and international media reported on Denshaw's entry on Wikipedia which had been vandalised with spoof information, although the offending material was removed after initial reports were published. The story featured on the BBC's North West Tonight, a regional news programme, and later picked up by news services as far away as Pakistan."

Denshaw was created an ecclesiastical parish in 1864, out of the former Friarmere parochial chapelry. It was in the deanery of Ashton-under-Lyne from 1864 to 1872. It then became part of Rochdale deanery until 1881 when it again became part of Ashton-under-Lyne. In 1929, it transferred to Oldham deanery. It is currently in Saddleworth Deanery, part of the Archdeanery of Rochdale, in the Anglican Diocese of Manchester.From 1894 to 1900, Denshaw lay within Saddleworth Rural District, a local government district in the administrative County of York, West Riding. In 1900, Denshaw was merged into Saddleworth Urban District, where it stayed until 1974. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Saddleworth Urban District was abolished, and Denshaw has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, within Greater Manchester.

The county seat is Mount Vernon.Posey County is part of the Evansville, Indiana metropolitan statistical area. The Ports of Indiana-Mount Vernon, on the Ohio River, is the seventh-largest inland port complex in the nation.

        "content": "After the American Revolutionary War, Posey County was originally considered part of the Northwest Territory, organized in 1787 by the new United States. As part of the Indiana Territory, it was organized in November 1814 from Gibson and Warrick counties. It was named for Revolutionary War Gen. Thomas Posey, who was then serving as Governor of the Territory. Mount Vernon was designated as the county seat in 1825. Its port on the Ohio River continues to be integral to the economy of the state and county.\nLike other parts of southern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, Posey County was first settled by people from the Upper South, many of whom arrived via the Ohio River. Farming was the primary development at first. In the mid- to late 19th century, the county received many German immigrants. The river port had rougher areas of vice, and a higher population of single men, as was typical. African Americans were among the men who worked on ships and at the port.\nPosey County was the site of the largest recorded lynching of African Americans in Indiana's history. In October 1878, a white mob lynched seven black men in the span of a few days. No one in the mob was prosecuted, and at each court session for the next three years, the prosecutor asked the judge to \"set the case over to the next session\". A grand jury was called to investigate the mob action, but with an election pending for the prosecuting attorney, no one was ever indicted. Following years of research, Posey County judge Jim Redwine wrote a novel, Judge Lynch! (2008), based on the events. Redwine sometimes lectures on the riot, inviting his audience to imagine how they would have acted and stressing the injustice done to the African Americans who were denied the right to a fair trial."

Despite a peace treaty which had been signed between the peasants and the city of Bern, on May 30, 1653, Z\u00fcrich assembled an army under the command of Conrad Werdm\u00fcller with the task to break any armed resistance once and for all times. Some 8,000 men with 800 horses and 18 cannons marched towards the Aargau. Already three days later, Werdm\u00fcller's army controlled the important crossing of the river Reuss at Mellingen. In the hills around the nearby villages of Wohlenschwil and Othmarsingen a peasant army of some 24,000 men assembled, led by Leuenberger and Schybi. A peasant delegation tried to negotiate with Werdm\u00fcller, showing him the peace treaty concluded with Bern. Werdm\u00fcller, who had been until then unaware of this treaty that had been signed only days before, refused to acknowledge the validity of the contract and demanded the unconditional surrender of the peasants. Thus rebutted, the peasants attacked Werdm\u00fcller's troops on June 3, 1653, but being poorly equipped and lacking any artillery, they were defeated decisively in the Battle of Wohlenschwil. The peasants were forced to agree to the peace of Mellingen, which annulled the Huttwil League. The peasant troops returned home and an amnesty was declared, except for the leaders of the movement."

In the modern Yurok orthography, it is spelled Suemeeg, pronounced [\u0282umi\u0263] or [\u0282umij].Patrick Beegan, an Irish immigrant who came from the Mississippi Valley in 1851, referred to the area as Patrick's Ranch. After encountering wild potato, \"Old Patrick,\" as he was known to the residents of the Trinidad area, decided to stop and file a preemption claim to the land.  Beegan's claim to the land was first recorded in the Trinidad Record Book on January 13, 1851, and the first official mention of Patrick's Point on the Humboldt County map was in 1886.  \nAnother narrative attributes the name to Patrick McLaughlin, a squatter who arrived in the 1870s and is credited with planting the first apple trees in the area.Efforts to protect the wooded region and coastal rock formations led to the establishment of the park, ultimately encompassing an area of 420.01 acres (169.97 ha), originally named Patrick's Point State Park. \nLater, requests that the park be renamed because Patrick Beegan had been accused of murdering several Indigenous Americans led to a name change. Sue-meg, reflecting the original Yurok name for the land, became official by unanimous vote of the California State Parks and Recreation Commission in 2021."

Appleby Magna is listed as partly in Derbyshire and partly in Leicestershire, where Appleby Parva is listed as being in Leicestershire\nBoth have shifted across the borders several times but have been part of Leicestershire since 1897.Appleby Parva is listed in the Doomsday Book as under the lordship of Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby, who held it under his father Henry de Ferrers, a French Nobleman and companion of William I. The Hamlet is valued at \u00a30.5, with a taxable value of 1 Geld Unit, and a population of 4 households and 4 freeman.\nThe hamlet is thought to have been relatively undeveloped until prior to the Norman Invasion of 1066; the land sits at the bottom of a hill and is poorly drained, so was not cultivated by the Saxons or Danes: the settlement only began to properly develop under its new French Lord, post-1066.  There is thought to have been some local ethnic divide, with Appleby Magna (owned by Burton Abbey and Lady Godiva) inhabited by primarily Anglo-Saxon villagers, and Appleby Parva inhabited by a small group of Normans."

It was named for its earlier-established neighbor, South Brunswick. Brunswick comes from New Brunswick, which was named after the German city of Braunschweig, formerly translated in English as Brunswick or for the British royal House of Brunswick. North and South Brunswick, in turn, became the namesakes for East Brunswick. Alternatively, the city gets its name from King George II of Great Britain, the Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg."

It then joins with U.S. Route 101 for the last few miles in Santa Barbara County before crossing the Santa Maria River and splitting off in San Luis Obispo County. For the next 75 miles (121 km), SR 166 crosses the Santa Barbara/San Luis Obispo county line a total of five times. This stretch follows the Cuyama River through a canyon separating the Sierra Madre Mountains from mountains in San Luis Obispo County, and then opens out into the Cuyama Valley, passing cattle ranches, going through the Russell Ranch Oil Field, and passing Aliso Canyon Road, the turnoff to the South Cuyama Oil Field. On the north during this stretch is the mile-high Caliente Range, which contains Caliente Mountain, the highest peak in San Luis Obispo County.\nAfter going through the towns of New Cuyama and Cuyama, the highway meets SR 33 north of Ventucopa. SR 33 and SR 166 merge until reaching Maricopa, where SR 166 heads due east for its last 20 miles (32 km), intersecting with I-5 about 9 miles (14 km) north of the Grapevine. SR 166 ends at SR 99 in Mettler, and it is the last exit for both I-5 and SR 99 southbound before they merge near Wheeler Ridge.\nIn Kern County, Highway 166 is known as the Maricopa Highway. West of Maricopa, where it skirts Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, it is called the Cuyama Highway. In the cities of Santa Maria and Guadalupe, it is known as Main Street.\nSR 166 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The route is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. From US 101 to SR 33, SR 166 is known as the \"CHP Officers Irvine and Stovall Memorial Highway\". In February 1998, a large storm swelled the Cuyama River and caused it to wash out a section of the highway. Officers Britt Irvine and Rick Stovall were responding to an early morning call about a truck accident when their CHP cruiser drove off the washed out section."

It is the largest city in Boeotia and a major center for the area along with Livadeia and Tanagra.\nIt played an important role in Greek myths, as the site of the stories of Cadmus, Oedipus, Dionysus, Heracles and others. Archaeological excavations in and around Thebes have revealed a Mycenaean settlement and clay tablets written in the Linear B script, indicating the importance of the site in the Bronze Age.\nThebes was the largest city of the ancient region of Boeotia and was the leader of the Boeotian confederacy. It was a major rival of ancient Athens, and sided with the Persians during the 480 BC invasion under Xerxes I. Theban forces under the command of Epaminondas ended Spartan hegemony at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, with the Sacred Band of Thebes, an elite military unit of male lovers celebrated as instrumental there. Macedonia would rise in power at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, bringing decisive victory to Philip II over an alliance of Thebes and Athens. Thebes was a major force in Greek history prior to its destruction by Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was the most dominant city-state at the time of the Macedonian conquest of Greece. During the Byzantine period, the city was famous for its silks.\nThe modern city contains an archaeological museum, the remains of the Cadmea (Bronze Age and forward citadel), and scattered ancient remains. Modern Thebes is the largest town of the regional unit of Boeotia."

Five main cycles of story may be distinguished:\n\nThe foundation of the citadel Cadmea by Cadmus, and the growth of the Spartoi or \"Sown Men\" (probably an aetiological myth designed to explain the origin of the Theban nobility which bore that name in historical times).\nThe immolation of Semele and the advent of Dionysus.\nThe building of a \"seven-gated\" wall by Amphion, and the cognate stories of Zethus, Antiope and Dirce.\nThe tale of Laius, whose misdeeds culminated in the tragedy of Oedipus and the wars of the Seven against Thebes and the Epigoni, and the downfall of his house; Laius' pederastic rape of Chrysippus was held by some ancients to have been the first instance of homosexuality among mortals, and may have provided an etiology for the practice of pedagogic pederasty for which Thebes was famous.\nThe exploits of Heracles.The Greeks attributed the foundation of Thebes to Cadmus, a Phoenician king from Tyre (now in Lebanon) and the brother of Queen Europa. Cadmus was famous for teaching the Phoenician alphabet and building the Acropolis, which was named the Cadmeia in his honor and was an intellectual, spiritual, and cultural center."

These bridges were designed by Keller & Harrington of Chicago, Illinois, and built by the Phoenix Bridge Company of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. Each bridge uses a 629-short-ton (571 t) over-head concrete counterweight.  Originally, there were four bridges, but only two of them remain.The bridges were formerly connected to North Station by a wooden trestle; the trestle burned in January 1984, forcing all trains to terminate at a temporary station north of the river for 15 months.The two aging two-track draw spans are planned to be replaced by three new two-track spans, which will be more reliable and have higher capacity. The unfinished sixth platform at North Station will be completed to serve long out-of-service tracks 11 and 12, the Fitchburg mainline will be slightly relocated to provide more layover space near the maintenance facility, and FX interlocking will be reconfigured. The signals contract associated with the new drawbridges was awarded in May 2019. As of November 2022, signal work is expected to be completed in August 2023. Design of the new vertical lift bridges began in 2019 and was 75% complete by May 2023, with design completion expected in 2024."

The Bengali word for bear is \u09ad\u09be\u09b2\u09c1\u0995 (Bhaluk), so Bhaluka is considered a corruption of Bhaluk.\nThe revenue office (kachari bari) of the eastern bazaar was under the name of Bhawal's zamindar.

It came under Muslim rule during the reign of Sultan Alauddin Husain Shah in the early fourteenth century.\nKhan Saheb Abedullah Chowdhury was a notable zamindar of Bhaluka. He, along with his wife, Halimunnesa Chowdhurani, made significant contributions to the development of Bhaluka. Under the leadership of Abedullah Chowdhury and with the assistance of Mansur Ali Khan, Zayed Ali, and Zayed Khan, the Bhaluka Bazar (marketplace) was established. However, the Bhaluka Bazar area was divided into two parts, each controlled by different zamindars (landowners). The western bazaar was under Maharaja Shashikanta of the Muktagacha Zamindari, while the entirety of Bhaluka, along with the eastern bazaar, was under the Bhawal Zamindari. In the forests of the former part, there was a mazar whose custodian was Innat Faqir, the father of Wahid Ali Faqir. There was a courthouse in the eastern bazaar, where rent was collected for the Zamindar of Bhawal. The village next to the marketplace also came to be known as Bhaluka. Separating from the Gafargaon Thana, Bhaluka became its own administrative thana of Mymensingh Subdivision in 1917. Maulvi AKM Nazir Hosain was appointed as the Sub-Registrar of Bhaluka.Their son Aftabuddin Chowdhury served as a member of the National Assembly from 1965 to 1969 representing the Pakistan Muslim League and later as an MP in Bangladesh from the same party. The Dhaka-Mymensingh highway was constructed during the regime of Ayub Khan following a proposal by Chowdhury.\nDuring the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Afsar Uddin Ahmed, the Sub-sector Commander of Sector 11, gathered arms and ammunition and established the Afsar Bahini to challenge the Pakistan Army. Mohammad Abdul Mannan, a Civil Engineering student and the vice president of the student wing at Rajshahi Engineering College, was the first to collect three units of 303 rifles from the nearest thana and requested Afsar Uddin to train everyone. Shah Ali Akbar was also a freedom fighter from Bhaluka. Together with Mohammad Abdul Mannan and Afsar Uddin Ahmed, he organized the mukti bahini (freedom fighters) in Bhaluka. The Pakistan Army established military camps at Mallikbari, Ashka, Tamat, and Bhaluka Bazar. A memorial monument was erected at Bhaluka Bus Stand. Bhaluka Thana was upgraded to an upazila in August 1983.\nIn 2010, work began on the Kadigarh National Park located in Palgaon, Kachina Union."

The Galle Face Green was initially laid out by the Dutch as a means to enable their cannons a strategic line of fire against the Portuguese. One version of how the name Galle Face is derived, is that it is from the original Dutch name for the fortifications, in that the gateway which gave access to the Colombo Fort was called the Gal Gate, as it faced southwards to Galle and faas means front, so it literally means in front of the fortification that faced toward Galle. Another version is it is a corruption of the original name for the area's rocky shoreline, Gal Bokka, Gal being the Sinhalese for rock and that Gal Gate actually meant rock gate.\nIn 1856 the then Governor of British Ceylon, Sir Henry George Ward (1797\u20131860) authorised the construction of a 1 mile (1.6 km) promenade along the oceanside of the Galle Face Green, for ladies and children to saunter and \u2018take in the air\u2019.

It is one of the most important roads of the Upper Silesian Industrial Region.\nThe DT\u015a runs most of its course parallel to the A4 motorway but, unlike the A4, the DT\u015a provides access to the congested city centers of the Metropolis GZM with 26 junctions (A4 has 6 junctions in the comparable section).The DT\u015a runs from Katowice through Chorz\u00f3w and \u015awi\u0119toch\u0142owice, Ruda \u015al\u0105ska, Zabrze to Gliwice.\nThe construction of road resulted in a considerable improvement in the traffic of the highly urbanized area of the metropolis. It shortened the road distance between Katowice and Gliwice by 26%, travelling time by 76%, consumption of gasoline by 47%, the number of road accidents by 82%, exploitation costs by 39%, and air pollution by 50%."

Since 1994 the budget for construction increased thanks to the European Investment Bank (EIB) that provided a guarantee of funding. Since 1999 the construction of the DT\u015a has been a shared responsibility of the Polish government, local government of the Silesian Voivodeship and of the cities through which the road runs, and work progresses steadily. A local organization in Gliwice has been protesting against proposed layout of the road through the city center (on ecological basis).  The construction has been completed in 2016.\nAn eastern extension of the DT\u015a is planned for a more distant future. This branch would run from Katowice to Mys\u0142owice, Sosnowiec, B\u0119dzin and D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza. The planned length of this section is 22.3 km (13.9 mi).\n\n\n== References =="

High levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPS), byproducts of industrial processes, were present in eggs from free-range chickens. An egg tested by researchers was found to have 84 nanograms per kilogram of dioxins and furans, a level 33 times higher than the safety limit observed by the European Union.The most polluted air in Thailand in 2018 was found to be in Samut Sakhon province. According to the PCD, the level of PM2.5 in the provincial atmosphere in 2019 was unusually high, measuring as high as 195 micrograms per cubic metre (\u03bcg/m3). During the air pollution \"season\" of 2018\u20132019, PM2.5 levels exceeded the PCD's safe threshold of 50 \u03bcg/m3 for 41 days.Samut Sakhon is a leading sea salt producer.

Only one Boeing E-4 NEACP escapes in time, and the officials of the Eighth Air Force and STRATCOM are eliminated in the process.

        "content": "Before European settlement, the area consisted of several diverse ecosystems based on freshwater, brackish water, and saltwater environments. Large areas were covered by forests. Considered by residents of the area through the centuries as wastelands, the Meadowlands were systematically subject to various kinds of human intervention. The four major categories are:\n\nExtraction of natural resources (including fish and game, as well as cedar logs). Farmers also harvested salt hay for feed. Over time, the forest resources were totally depleted, dike systems broke down, farming ceased, and contamination by pollution increased.\nAlteration of water flow. Drainage canals and especially the deepening of the Hackensack River for navigation have allowed salt water to enter the original fresh water and brackish water areas, altering the ecology and destroying the estuarine environment.\nReclamation, land making, and development. In addition to landfill from garbage, landmass generated from dredging was also used to create new land. Some material came from building the World Trade Center in nearby New York City, during the late 1960s.\nPollution by sewage, refuse, and hazardous waste. Various types of waste have been dumped legally and illegally in the Meadowlands. During World War II, military refuse was dumped in the Meadowlands, including rubble from London created by the Blitz and used as ballast in returning ships. After the war, the Meadowlands continued to be used for civilian waste disposal, as the marshes were considered simply as wastelands that were not good for anything else. In early to mid-20th c. Berrys Creek was extensively polluted with mercury, PCBs and other chemical wastes, and three adjacent industrial properties were subsequently designated as Superfund sites. The opening of the New Jersey Turnpike in January 1952 only amplified the continuing environmental degradation of the Meadowlands. Both spurs of the Turnpike travel through the region from the Passaic River to just past North Bergen.The Meadowlands Sports Complex, the site of multiple stadia and a racetrack, was built in the Meadowlands beginning in the 1960s. The race track was the first venue in the complex to open, on September 1, 1976."

        "content": "Pennsylvania Route 462 (PA 462) is a 32-mile-long (51 km) east\u2013west state route in York and Lancaster counties in central Pennsylvania. The western terminus is west of York, and the eastern terminus is east of Lancaster. At both ends, PA 462 terminates at U.S. Route 30 (US 30), which follows a mostly freeway alignment parallel to the north between York and Lancaster. The route heads east into York, where it follows the one-way pair of Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound. In York, PA 462 runs concurrent with PA 74 and crosses Interstate 83 Business (I-83 Bus.). East of York, the route becomes a multilane road that has an interchange with I-83 and crosses PA 24. PA 462 continues east through Hallam to Wrightsville and passes through that town before it crosses the Susquehanna River and runs through Columbia. East of here, the route continues through Mountville before reaching the city of Lancaster. In Lancaster, PA 462 is routed on the one-way pair of King Street eastbound and Walnut Street westbound, with the westbound direction concurrent with PA 23. The route crosses US 222/PA 272 and northbound PA 72 in Lancaster. East of Lancaster, PA 462 becomes a multilane road again and continues to its eastern terminus.\nThe section of the current route east of Lancaster was built as a turnpike called the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in 1794, which headed east to Philadelphia. By 1796, a road continued west from Lancaster across the Susquehanna River to York. The state took over the turnpike in the beginning of the 20th century. In 1913, the road between York and Lancaster was incorporated into the Lincoln Highway, an auto trail that ran from San Francisco east to New York City. The Lincoln Highway through Pennsylvania became PA 1 in 1924. US 30 was designated concurrent with PA 1 west of Philadelphia in 1926, with the PA 1 designation removed two years later. US 30 was widened into a multilane road between York and Lancaster in the 1930s. The route was moved to one-way pairs in Lancaster in the 1930s, following King Street eastbound and Orange Street westbound, and York in the 1950s, following Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound. In 1967, US 30 was moved to a freeway bypass between Prospect Road east of Columbia and east of Lancaster, with the former alignment becoming PA 462. US 30 was realigned to a freeway between York and Columbia in 1972 and PA 462 was extended west along the former alignment to west of York. In the 1970s, westbound PA 462 was moved from Orange Street to Walnut Street in Lancaster."

        "content": "The section of present-day PA 462 east of Lancaster was constructed as the westernmost part of the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, a turnpike connecting Lancaster to Philadelphia. The turnpike company was incorporated in 1792 and the road was completed in 1794. The Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike was built with a stone and gravel surface and was the first long-distance turnpike constructed in the United States, leading to a movement to improve roads across the country. The turnpike also opened up settlement to the Northwest Territory past the Ohio River and provided cheap transportation between the coastal areas and the \"bread basket\" region around Lancaster. By 1796, a road continued west from Lancaster to the Susquehanna River and to York. \nThe Lancaster and Susquehanna Turnpike was chartered to run from Lancaster to Columbia in 1794 and was built in the 1810s. By 1843, the rise of the railroads and the canals reduced the use of the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, and the road fell into disrepair and saw decreased usage through the later part of the 19th century.The state acquired the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in the beginning of the 20th century. Following the passage of the Sproul Road Bill in 1911, current PA 462 was designated as Legislative Route 126 west of York, Legislative Route 128 between York and Lancaster, and Legislative Route 215 east of Lancaster. In 1913, this portion of road became part of the Lincoln Highway, an auto trail that ran from San Francisco east to New York City. The Lincoln Highway within Pennsylvania was designated as PA 1 in 1924. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, US 30 was designated concurrent with PA 1 on the Lincoln Highway west of Philadelphia. The concurrent PA 1 designation was removed from US 30 in 1928.US 30 originally ran along King Street through the city of Lancaster. In York, the route followed Market Street through the city. The section of US 30 to the west of York, between York and Lancaster, and to the east of Lancaster was widened to a multilane highway in the 1930s. The route was shifted to use the one-way pair of King Street eastbound and Orange Street westbound through Lancaster in the 1930s. In the 1950s, US 30 was moved to the one-way pair of Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound through York.In 1967, US 30 was shifted to a freeway bypass between Prospect Road east of Columbia and east of Lancaster; PA 462 was designated onto the former alignment of US 30 between those two points. In 1972, PA 462 was extended west to its current terminus at US 30 west of York after US 30 was shifted to a bypass between west of York and Columbia. In the 1970s, the route was widened to a divided highway near the PA 24 intersection. The westbound direction of PA 462 in Lancaster was shifted from Orange Street to Walnut Street, running concurrent with PA 23, in the 1970s. In York, the eastbound direction of PA 462 was originally planned to be shifted to Princess Street as part of constructing Continental Square at the intersection of Market and George streets; however, it remained along Market Street."

Fueled by the mining industry, Yakutsk has become one of Russia's most rapidly growing regional cities, with a population of 355,443 at the 2021 Census.Yakutsk has an average annual temperature of \u22128.0 \u00b0C (17.6 \u00b0F), winter high temperatures consistently well below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), and a record low of \u221264.4 \u00b0C (\u221283.9 \u00b0F). As a result, Yakutsk is the coldest major city in the world (although a number of smaller towns in that region are slightly colder). Yakutsk is also the largest city located in continuous permafrost; the only other large city is Norilsk, also in Siberia. Yakutsk is located in the Central Yakutian Lowland and is a major port on the Lena River. It is served by the Yakutsk Airport as well as the smaller Magan Airport."

Average monthly temperatures in Yakutsk range from +19.9 \u00b0C (67.8 \u00b0F) in July to \u221237.0 \u00b0C (\u221234.6 \u00b0F) in December. Yakutsk is the largest city built on continuous permafrost, and many houses there are built on concrete piles.\nThe lowest temperatures ever recorded on the planet outside Antarctica and Greenland have occurred in the basin of the Yana River to the northeast of Yakutsk. Although winters are extremely cold and long - Yakutsk has never recorded a temperature above freezing between 10 November and 14 March inclusive \u2013 summers are sunny, warm and occasionally hot (though short), with daily maximum temperatures exceeding +30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), making the seasonal temperature differences for the region the greatest in the world at 102 \u00b0C (184 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature recorded in Yakutsk was \u221264.4 \u00b0C (\u221283.9 \u00b0F) on 5 February 1891 and the highest temperatures +38.4 \u00b0C (101.1 \u00b0F) on 17 July 2011 and +38.3 \u00b0C (100.9 \u00b0F) on 15 July 1942. The hottest month in records going back to 1834 has been July 1894, with a mean of +23.2 \u00b0C (73.8 \u00b0F), and the coldest, January 1900, which averaged \u221251.4 \u00b0C (\u221260.5 \u00b0F). Yakutsk is the largest city in the world with an average winter temperature of below \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F).Yakutsk is an inland location, being almost 1,000 km (620 mi) from the Pacific Ocean, which coupled with the high latitude means exposure to severe winters and also lack of temperature moderation. July temperatures soar to an above-normal average for this latitude, with the average being several degrees hotter than more southerly Far East cities such as Vladivostok or Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. The July daytime temperatures are even hotter than some maritime subtropical areas. The warm summers ensure that Yakutsk, despite its freezing winters, is far south of the tree line. In winter, Yakutsk instead is between 35 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) and 40 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) colder than the mildest cities on similar latitudes in Scandinavia.\nThe climate is quite dry, with most of the annual precipitation occurring in the summer months, due to the intense Siberian High forming around the very cold continental air during the winter. However, summer precipitation is not heavy since the moist southeasterly winds from the Pacific Ocean lose their moisture over the coastal mountains well before reaching the Lena Valley."

The city's connection to that highway is only usable by ferry in the summer, or in the dead of winter, by driving directly over the frozen Lena River, since Yakutsk lies entirely on its western bank, and there is no bridge anywhere in the Sakha Republic that crosses the Lena. In the dead of winter, the frozen Lena River makes for a passable highway for ice truckers using its channel to deliver provisions to far-flung outposts. The river is impassable for long periods of the year when it contains loose ice, when the ice cover is not thick enough to support traffic, or when the water level is too high and the river is turbulent with spring flooding. The highway ends on the eastern bank of Lena in Nizhny Bestyakh (\u041d\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044f\u0445), an urban-type settlement of some four thousand people. Nizhny Bestyakh is connected with Magadan by the Kolyma Highway.\nConstruction of a highway bridge over the River Lena to Yakutsk was approved by president Vladimir Putin on 9 November 2019. Based upon a design submitted in 2008, it would be over 3 km (1.9 mi) long and constructed 40 km (25 mi) upriver at Tabaga, where the river narrows and does not create a wide flooded area in spring. The cost of the bridge and its 10.9 km (6.8 mi) of approaches was estimated at 63.7 billion Rubles (83 billion rubles including VAT [\u041d\u0414\u0421]), of which a grant of 54.2 billion Rubles was to be provided, with the remainder to be sourced from investors. The bridge was to be toll-free for cars, with a toll for trucks. As of summer 2022, work has yet to begin on the project.\nThe bridge had originally been planned to be a dual-use railroad and highway bridge so the Amur Yakutsk Mainline, the North\u2013South railroad being extended from the south, could connect the city with the East\u2013West Baikal Amur Mainline. The railroad reached the settlement of Nizhny Bestyakh, on the opposite bank of the Lena from Yakutsk, in November 2011.The 2019 completion of a new rail line to the eastern bank of the Lena permitted the start of passenger rail services between Yakutsk and the rest of Russia.\nYakutsk is also connected to other parts of Russia by Yakutsk Airport."

Experts from the University of Puerto Rico argued that these crops could cover approximately 30% of the local demand, particularly that of smaller vegetables such as tomatoes, lettuce, etc. and several kinds of tubers that are currently being imported. The existence of a thriving agricultural economy has been prevented due to a shift in priorities towards industrialization, bureaucratization, mismanagement of terrains, lack of alternative methods and a deficient workforce.

Coffee production, and sugar cane production in Puerto Rico has had a history of ups and downs, affected by hurricanes and by its isolated location, and its political status as a colony of Spain and of the United States.\nIn 1900, the most important agricultural products in Puerto Rico were \"cotton, rice, cacao, corn, coconuts, pepper, bananas, tobacco, vegetable dyes, coffee, sugar, pineapples and vanilla\".\nThe impact in August 1899 of two hurricanes severely affected the island.  The 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane on August 8, and an unnamed hurricane on August 22 killed approximately 3,400 people and left thousands without shelter, food, or work. The hurricanes cost the economy millions of dollars  due to the destruction of the majority of the sugar and coffee plantations. Afterwards, nearly 5\u201a000 Puerto Ricans migrated to Hawaii by 1910 to work in the sugar plantations of said state.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s agriculture continued to play a crucial role in the island's economy with 45% of the labor force employed within the sector in 1940. The cultivation of pineapples was significant until the 1990s when the main buyer Lotus juice company closed.In 2012, there were 13,159 farms in Puerto Rico. While not a state, Puerto Rico is a member of the Southern United States Trade Association, a non-profit organization that assists the agriculture industry in developing its exports. In early 2020, farm owners in Ponce reported on the continuing challenge of finding laborers."

        "content": "As a result of the 2009 economic crisis and the susceptibility of Puerto Rico to hurricanes, there's been an urgency to push for more farms on the island. While not large enough to produce on a mass scale, the quality of products is high. Farming has a more positive image among young people in Puerto Rico, however, in places like Ponce, where the weather tends to be hotter, farm owners complain that the turnover rate is too high.In September 2019, an initiative to diminish the amount of coffee that is imported to Puerto Rico was announced by the Hispanic Federation, leading 1,500 Puerto Rico coffee growers."

One important pest this protects against is the Fall Armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda), including Cry1F-resistant FAW. In 2007 Cry1F resistance in FAW was confirmed here and Dow and Pioneer withdrew their Cry1F corn \u2013 Herculex I, released in 2003 \u2013 from use here. Nonetheless as of 2018 other Cry1F corns are still commonly grown here.By contrast Storer et al., 2012 notes no such resistance from the mainland of the United States (up to their publication), showing a lack of movement of FAW from here to there. Then in 2014 Huang et al. found alleles that are shared with FAW populations on the US mainland. Due to this history of detections, migration from PR is probably the source of Cry1F-resistance FAW there and not the other way around. On the other hand Banerjee et al., 2017 finds Cry1F-r in Puerto Rico is commonly caused by a particular mutation in SfABCC2, the resistance allele SfABCC2mut. SfABCC2 is the FAW version of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (ATP Binding Cassette subfamily C2, ABCC2). They did not find a single such allele in Florida in 2012, 2014, or 2016. These very disparate prevalences fail to support any substantial immigration of FAW from PR to Florida, contrary to earlier studies including Huang above.The use of two or more effective Cry proteins may be necessary to provide multiple modes of action for resistance management.Both the Fall Armyworm C-strain and -R-strain are found here, and are shared with Louisiana. These strains were first discovered by Pashley 1986 via a genetic analysis of the PR and La populations, showing segregation on host preference. Both have since been found elsewhere around the world."

        "content": "The origin of the suburb name is from a description of the area provided by Major Edmund Lockyer whilst exploring in a boat along the Brisbane River.While the Redbank area is known for its agricultural and pastoral origins, it has a more varied history.In the late 1850s, the first farmers in the area settled on the river flats situated to the north of the current railway station. This settlement featured a brickworks, sawmill, stores, cottages, a school and nondenominational church, though due to severe flooding, it was relocated south of the railway station some years later.In the early years, the rich black loamy soil of the plains supported crops of maize, potatoes and fodder, while cotton became a significant crop in the 1860s and 1870s. By the beginning of the 20th century, dairying became more important with the establishment of several creameries in the area.The late 1850s saw the establishment of the first secondary industry in the area, with a boiling down works and fellmongery owned by Mr John Campbell and Mr Town.Redbank's school was originally opened on July 1865 by the Roman Catholic Church on a 2-acre (0.81 ha) land parcel with an initial enrolment of 31 students. The building was used as both a school and a church. In 1881, it became Redbank State School. It closed on 30 September 1895, but reopened on 6 September 1897. In 1951, a further 5.5 acres (2.2 ha) of land was acquired to expand the school site.The Redbank - Bundamba Loop Line comprised a series of railway sidings serving coal mines in the area.Redbank Rifle Range operated from 1912 to 1980 south of the Redbank railway station. It was the home of a number rifle clubs over the years including Ipswich Railway Rifle Club, Ipswich City Rifle Club, Ipswich and District Rifle Club, which were involved in competitive target shooting. The 700-yard (640 m) firing mound was about 35 metres (38 yd) from the railway station with the targets 700 yards (640 m) away (approx 27.6057\u00b0S 152.8755\u00b0E\ufeff / -27.6057; 152.8755\ufeff (Redbank Rifle Club (targets))). During World War II, there was a large military camp and training area at the range with up to 6,000 Australian and American troops. The development of the Ipswich Motorway reduced the length of the rifle range which led to the relocation of the Ipswich and District Rifle Club to South Ripley in 1972.The Redbank Railway Workshops has been operating in the suburb since 1958.The current Redbank Plaza Library was opened in 1998 and had a major refurbishment in 2010.In the 2016 census, Redbank had a population of 1,834 people. Redbank had an unemployment rate of 14.5%, more than double the Australian unemployment rate of 6.9%."

Originally, US 82 entered Guthrie from the west and was duplexed with US 83 southbound for approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) before the two routes separated past the South Wichita River bridge. The concurrency was eliminated with the construction of the US 82 bypass to the west of Guthrie and the upgrading of the southern intersection of the two highways to an interchange. Spur 729 is a section of the former US 82 into Guthrie, while the remaining portion of the former route was deleted from the state highway system.Previously, the roadway extended beyond the current western terminus and functioned as a ramp to westbound US 82; this ramp was eventually obliterated, as originally proposed by TxDOT to AASHTO, though its footprint is still visible past the barricades and fencing."

        "content": "In 1660, five men from Dedham were sent to explore the lakes near George Indian's wigwam and to report back to the selectmen what they found. The report of those men, Daniel Fisher, Anthony Fisher, Sgt. Fuller, Richard Ellis, and Richard Wheeler, was received with such enthusiasm that in March 1661 it was voted to start a new settlement there. The Town then voted to send Ellis and Timothy Dwight to go negotiate with King Phillip to purchase the title to the area known as Wollomonopoag.They purchased 600 acres of land for \u00a324, 6s. The money was paid out of pocket by Captain Willett, who accompanied Ellis and Dwight. The Town voted to assess a tax upon the cow commons to repay him, but some thought the money should be paid by those who would be moving to the new village. The dispute resulted in Willet not being paid back for several years.After the boundaries of the new community were set, the Town voted to give up all rights to the land in return for the proprietors paying Dedham \u00a3160 over four years, beginning in 1661. By January 1663, however, little progress had been made towards establishing a new village. A meeting was called, and the 10 men who volunteered to go raised several concerns about their ability to move forward.After much discussion, it was decided not to give the 600 acres to the group of pre-selected men, but rather to lay out lots and then award them by lottery. Those who already began to improve their lots were allowed to keep them, and land for a church, burial ground, training ground, roads, and officer lots were not included. All were free to buy and sell their lots.Not much happened at Wollomonopoag until 1668, at which time a report arrived of native peoples planting corn and cutting down trees on the land that Dedham had purchased. Eleazer Lusher was charged with sending the illiterate Indians a letter warning them to \"depart from that place and trespass no further.\" Samuel Fisher then took it to them and read it aloud, at which point they replied that they had every intention of remaining on the land. Though they had still not paid him back for the land in question, the Town then asked Willett to speak with King Phillip and ask that he intervene.There is no record of Phillip's response to that entreaty but, in August 1669, the Town Fathers received an odd letter from him offering to negotiate for more land if they would quickly send him a \"holland shirt.\" Dwight and four others were appointed to negotiate with him again, provided Phillip could prove he, and not another sachem, had the rights to the land. In November, an agreement was reached to clear the title for \u00a317 0s 8d. There is no record of whether a shirt was traded.Samuel Sheares lived alone at Wollomonopoag for some time before a new attempt at a settlement was undertaken in 1671. Five men, John Thurston, Thomas Thurston, Robert Weare, John Weare, and Joseph Cheeney moved there with him, followed the next year by Rev. Samuel Man, a one-time teacher in the Dedham Public Schools. Robert Crossman was employed at the same time to construct a corn mill.Those who moved there were drawn from the middle class of Dedham. They were primarily people from outside of Dedham who had purchased land there, and second generation Dedhamites who moved without their parents. Without the outsides, it is questionable whether the new community would have survived.Soon, however, the Wollomonopoag settlers complained that those in the village center were keeping them in a state of colonial dependency. They were upset about absentee landlords whose land values were going up thanks to the labor of the inhabitants and who refused to pay taxes to support the community. They also complained that with the seat of the town government being so far away that they were disenfranchised and best by a lack of capital. Constables refused to travel to Wollomonopoag to make collections, assessments, and social judgement.With the blessing of Dedham's Board of Selectmen, the General Court separated the new town of Wrentham on October 16, 1673.It was burned down during King Philip's War 1675\u20131676. In the nineteenth century, Wrentham was the site of Day's Academy. For a short time, Wrentham was the residence of the educational reformer Horace Mann. It is also known as one of the residences of Helen Keller.\nNorth Wrentham separated as an independent town in 1870 with Plainville splitting off as an independent town in 1905."

From the earliest times until the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, the lake was part of an important waterway connecting the Atlantic seaboard of North America to the continental interior.\nThe lake is about 21 miles (34 km) long and about 5 miles (8.0 km) wide with an average depth of 22 feet (6.7 m). The shoreline is about 55 miles (89 km). Portions of six counties and 69 communities are in the watershed.

While not geologically considered one of the Finger Lakes, Oneida Lake, because of its proximity, is referred by some as their \"thumb\".

        "content": "During the 18th and early 19th centuries Oneida Lake and its tributary Wood Creek were part of the Albany-Oswego waterway from the Atlantic seaboard westward via the Hudson River and through the Appalachian Mountains via the Mohawk River; travel westward then was by portage over the Oneida Carry to the Wood Creek-Oneida Lake system. The navigable waterway exited Oneida Lake by the Oneida River, which led to the Oswego River and Lake Ontario, from where travelers could reach the other Great Lakes.\nFollowing the American Revolutionary War, the United States forced the Iroquois nations to cede most of their lands in that region, as most of them had allied with the British, who were defeated. In addition, demand from settlers created pressure for such cessions. White settlers improved the natural waterway by constructing a canal with locks within Wood Creek to Oneida Lake. This system was significantly improved\u2014from 1792 to 1803\u2014by cutting a canal across the Oneida Carry, after which commercial shipping across Oneida Lake increased substantially.\n Even more significant was the completion in 1825 of the Erie Canal, which bypassed the Oneida Lake system and enhanced travel through the entire Mohawk Valley. This caused the population around the lake to lose their navigable waterway eastward.\nIn 1835 Oneida Lake was connected to the Erie Canal system by construction of the (old) Oneida Canal, which ran about 4.5 miles (7.2 km) from Higginsville on the Erie Canal northward to Wood Creek, about 2 miles (3.2 km) upstream of Oneida Lake. Built poorly with wooden locks, the Oneida Canal was closed in 1863.When the Erie Canal was redesigned and reconstructed to form the New York State Barge Canal in the early 20th century, the engineers made use of natural rivers and lakes where possible. The new barges were powered internally (by diesel or steam engines), so they could travel open water and against a current; the system no longer needed infrastructure for drawing vessels externally \u2014 i.e., drawpaths and draft animals. After it straightened Fish Creek on the east, the new canalway entered Oneida Lake at Sylvan Beach and exited west with the Oneida River at Brewerton. New terminal walls at Sylvan Beach, Cleveland, and Brewerton allowed barges to load and unload cargo and to stay overnight. A new break wall was installed, preventing lake waves from entering the canal and protecting against shoaling. These improvements provided towns along the shoreline of Oneida Lake with access again to navigable waterways east and west."

In 1707, Champasak became one of three kingdoms arising from a dissolved Lan Xang Empire. The kingdom had only three kings, Soi Sisamut (1713\u201337), nephew of Suriya Vangas, Sainya Kuman (1737\u201391) and lastly Fai Na (1791\u20131811).

        "content": "Sweeny's settlement, though not under this name, began before Texas was even a Republic. Imla Keep, a doctor and member of Stephen F. Austin's Old Three Hundred colonists, received title to a league and labor of land that included the site of Sweeny on July 24, 1824. Keep eventually returned to Louisiana, and Martin Varner acquired the land. The land was named for John Sweeny, a Tennessee colonist who arrived with family members and 250 slaves in the area in 1833. He came after his sons, William Burrell and Thomas Jefferson Sweeny, had purchased land grants near the townsite. They purchased the land grants for the price of a load of mules, and came to examine their new land holdings in 1831. John Sweeny settled nearby, and in 1835, purchased the original Imla Keep League from Varner and constructed a house on the site. The home, today the Sweeny Plantation, a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark, was occupied by original family members through the 1990s. The original home was built in 1837 by slaves using only bricks, nails, and cypress and ash wood from the land. There were also 30 slave cabins made of cypress wood. The plantation had its own sawmill, sugar house, cotton gin, blacksmith shop, commissary, and a kiln for brick manufacture.The town was named for John Sweeny.The original town stood in a forest of hardwoods with soil twenty feet deep. Sweeny was briefly called Adamston when the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway reached the area in 1905 and laid a side track lined with gardens to the community. A post office was established in 1895, closed in 1897, and was reestablished in 1909 as Sweeny. Sweeny's cotton gin and general store were built by 1908, a school was organized in 1911 with eleven students, and church services were held in 1912, when a Civic Club was founded to promote civic and social improvements. Around 1910 the R. D. McDonald Bernard River Land Development Company, which later gave a plot of land to each church denomination, purchased acreage in the area, cut it into lots, and sold it.Burton D. Hurd platted the townsite in 1911.  His Burton D. Hurd Industrial Land Company promoted ten-acre suburban garden farms in the area with the slogan, \"Soil Richer Than the Valley of the River Nile\" to prospective settlers.By 1914 the community had a hotel, a flour mill, three general stores, a cotton gin, a gristmill, a sawmill, and a population of 200. In the 1920s Sweeny shipped cotton, vegetables, live-oak parts for ships, and, for a time, bullfrogs raised by area farmers. In 1918 it had a brick factory and an orange orchard. Sweeny had an independent school system by 1912; school enrollment reached 236 by 1927, and by 1937 the community had three black schools and an all-grade white school with six teachers. The Ku Klux Klan operated briefly and held one cross-burning in the community.In 1934, oil was discovered in Old Ocean, creating development which made Sweeny prosper. In 1942, a government carbon black plant was built which was taken over by Phillips Petroleum, which developed the facilities into a refinery, natural gas liquids center, and petrochemicals complex with pipelines to markets in the eastern United States. In 2000, Phillips Petroleum merged with Conoco Inc. to form ConocoPhillips. Sweeny's population in the latter 20th century has fluctuated from 3,087 to 3,699."

Seating capacities are approximately 15,596 for basketball, 14,224 for hockey, 8,000 for half-house concerts, 15,500 for end-stage concerts, and 18,000 for center-stage concerts.\nThe arena's main exterior landmark is the 37 m (93 ft) Larry A. Shehadey Clock Tower. 13 stories in-all, it was named for the founder of Producers Dairy Foods, a Fresno-based dairy company, who donated US$3 million towards construction. The lobby at the arena's southeast entrance is named after Shehadey\u2019s late wife, Elayne Shehadey.\nThe majority of the funding for the facility came from two sources. Save Mart Supermarkets paid US$40 million for 20 years naming rights, and the Pepsi Bottling Group paid a similar sum for exclusive, indefinite beverage dispensing rights. Total construction costs exceeded US$100 million and when completed, represented the largest privately funded complex of any university in the United States.The Bulldog Foundation donated money for the following amenities at Save Mart Center:\n\nThe Bulldog Foundation Community Room, which displays the names of past presidents, current officers, lifetime honorees and annual top fund raisers,  is used for show catering, premium seating holder dining, and is also available for rent.\nThe Bronze Bulldog at the Shehadey Lobby.

Statue onlookers will see engraved on its mounted plaque:This is our mascot and he ain't no hound.\nHe\u2019s an English bull and weighs lots of pounds\nHe\u2019s got two rows of teeth and a terrible frown\n\nHey, nobody\u2019s kicking our dog around!!!\nNine time capsule boxes were placed in the base of the massive Bulldog statue early in 2004. The contents of capsules were chosen to represent all aspects of Fresno State University, including the Bulldog Foundation, administration, alumni, students and athletics. The capsules are scheduled to be opened in early 2054.\nSave Mart Center's display cases, located on the upper and main concourses, exhibits equipment and memorabilia of each of the current Bulldog sport activities. Additionally, the display case in the northwest corner spotlights the academic success of Fresno State\u2019s student athletes.\nThe Bulldog Walkway is a permanent, on-campus tribute to the California State University, Fresno alumni, graduates and friends.

All were Fresno State alumni. Expected to eventually be extended throughout the campus, the walkway consists of personalized tiles and bricks intended to leave a lasting impression to those who use it.\nThe Bulldog Shop souvenir store is located on the arena's northeast lobby.

        "content": "The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1322, but the church was not new that year. The first church at Hopperstad was likely a small, wooden stave church that was built during the mid-11th century, possibly around the year 1060. This church was torn down and replaced with the present church during the early- to mid-12th century, possibly between the years 1130 and 1150. In 1982, archaeological evidence was found showing post holes for the large staves that support the idea of a previous church on the site. Again in 1997, a series of samples from the logs were collected for dendrochronological dating of the church. A total of seven samples produced an estimate for the construction ranging from 1034 to 1116 and resulted in no definite conclusion in the age of the church, however, this supports the idea that the materials from the old church were used in the construction of the present church.The medieval timbers of the church bear a significant number of graffiti, carved in runes.No records exist as to what the medieval church actually looked like. There are a variety of sketches showing a nave and chancel. The church did not undergo any major changes until the 1600s. At that time the nave was lengthened to the west, and a bell-tower was added above the new extension. To the east, a new section was added and built out of logs. A new vestibule to the south with its own entrance was also added. In 1723, the church was sold into private ownership at the Norwegian church auction so the King could pay off debts from the Great Northern War.The largest addition to the church came to the north with a log construction. This new part was named the \"new church\" (nykirken). The construction was finished during the 1700s (this area was torn down in around 1875). There are no known images of the interior from this time, but a story written by the priest Niels Dahl, who is assumed to have visited the church in 1824, describes the interior:\n\nThe church has galleries at three levels around all of the walls, that the church [had a rundt alle veggene og at den var lavloftet og t\u00f8mret] with staircases up to the galleries. And the font is placed under the medieval baldaquin. And the walls are painted by numerous quotes from the Holy Scripture in vivid colours.\nIn 1814, this church served as an election church (Norwegian: valgkirke). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway's first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called \"electors\" who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.In the 1870s, the two neighboring Hove Church and Hopperstad Stave Church parishes were both in need of new churches. The issue was first raised by the local parish priest J\u00f8rgen Christian Andreas Gr\u00f8ner who complained about the size of the two churches. Both churches were old and small and due to their age, they were in dire need of improvements. The local villagers believed he was exaggerating and the private owners of the church did not want to spend money on the churches. Soon after, the local priest decided to no longer hold services at the Hopperstad Stave Church since it was so cold and drafty. Within a short period of time, it was decided to merge the two neighboring parishes into one larger parish. On 11 December 1875, a royal decree was issued that ordered the closure of both churches and the construction of a new church in Vik\u00f8yri for the newly created parish. In 1877, the new Vik Church was constructed and the two older churches were taken out of regular use and preserved as historical sites.In 1877, after about 700 years in use, the old church was abandoned. The church had been in very poor condition for many years and three years after its closure, the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments purchased the building in 1880. All of the \"new\" additions were torn down, leaving just the medieval building still standing. Using the Borgund Stave Church as a model, architect Peter Andreas Blix reconstructed the church between 1884 and 1891. During the reconstruction, carved sections were found beneath the floor which indicated that the new church replaced an older church, which was probably built in the latter half of the 11th century. During the reconstruction, the nave and choir were left alone and the apse, corridors, and roof were all rebuilt. All of the newly rebuilt areas were based on similar existing stave churches such as the Borgund Stave Church and the Urnes Stave Church. Since its completion in 1891, the church has been used primarily as a museum, although the parish will still use the church for special occasions."

Wilson began Life School in Dallas as a conduit to train adults who were unemployed and had no employable skills, while at the same time offering activities for youth and children.  Wilson reorganized the school's objective after finding a low success rate regarding people whose lifestyles changed permanently. During the 1990s, Wilson worked to make Life School a free tuition school. This was in response to the gang activities in the Dallas area that made the city the murder capital (per capita) of the United States. Wilson's goal was to teach and train children before they became involved in gang activities.Life School filed a charter school application with the Texas Education Agency in 1997. The application was completed by Wilson along with other community leaders that included educational lawyers and other educators. In March 1998 the school was granted the charter and began open enrollment as a free tuition public school in August that same year. The school became popular in the communities it served and parents camped out overnight to enroll their children. The first Life School campus to open was in Oak Cliff, Texas in Dallas County.Life School became the first charter school in Texas to access Permanent School Funding. This took place in 2014 after the Texas State Board of Education expanded such funding to include charter schools. It eliminated its high rate of financing with the Permanent Education Fund now guaranteeing its bonds. Life School sold approximately $100 million in tax-exempt and taxable bonds to refund debt and build a new high school, which it broke ground for in 2014.

Governor John Peter Altgeld was instrumental in funding the Illinois university system, and he was especially fond of the Gothic style. Eastern's \"Old Main\"  and Illinois State University's Cook Hall are the only schools where the \"castle\" is not named after Altgeld. Other original Gothic Revival buildings include Booth Library and Blair Hall.  Blair Hall was restored after a disastrous fire in 2004. In fall 2008, the university opened the newly constructed Doudna Fine Arts Center,  designed by international architect Antoine Predock.  The 138,000-square-foot (12,800 m2) complex houses the music, theatre, and visual arts departments.Through the twentieth century, the school changed its name several times in order to reflect its transition from a teachers college into a multi-purpose institution that could be of wider service to Illinois. Thus, Eastern Illinois State Normal School became Eastern Illinois State Teachers College in 1921, which then became Eastern Illinois State College in 1947.

Archaeological evidence unearthed on the site has indicated that the chamber was used for the burial of bodies which at some point would be cremated and removed and replaced with others. The purpose of the exterior stones are believed to have been for resting the dead bodies against for the flesh to be devoured by birds before burial.  Excavations at the site have revealed flint and Neolithic style pottery and cremated bones.\nA local legend is associated with the chamber in that it is said  that the quoit possesses mystical powers and that removed stones from the structure would soon mysteriously find their way back in the middle of the night. In 1754 and in 1769, before the roof had fallen, the quoit was analysed by the antiquary Dr. William Borlase (1695\u20131772), who described and provided detailed drawings of it and published some of his findings in his Antiquities of Cornwall (1769).In 1861, a local farmer proposed to convert the monument into a cattle\u2013shed by removing one of the upright pillars and drilling a hole in the sloping capstone. The vandalism soon reached the disapproving ears of the villagers of Zennor and the local vicar, William Borlase (a great-grandson of Dr. William Borlase), intervened and successfully offered a financial incentive of five shillings to the farmer to build it elsewhere, although he had already built stone posts on the site to erect it. Traces of drill\u2013holes can still be seen in the stoneIn 1882, a member of the Borlase family came to the defence of the quoit again when the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society visited the site. The following account was reported:\n\nMr. Borlase, one of the members, met with a man who had made a find beneath the Zennor Quoit. The man explained that about a year ago, finding that other people were searching about, he and his son thought they would have 'a bit of a speer too.' After removing some of the earth, they came upon a flat stone, which they 'shut' (blasted). They then removed more earth and came upon another flat stone, which they also 'shut.' Underneath it they found what Mr. Borlase said was an ancient whetstone, which no doubt was buried with the dead, in order that he might have something to sharpen his weapons with in 'the happy hunting grounds' to which he was supposed to have gone. Mr. Borlase had found similar stones, with urns containing the ashes of the dead, in different barrows. Under this quoit he found part of an urn. Mr. Borlase expressed a hope that there would be no more 'shutting' near the quoit, because it ought to be regarded as sacred as the grave of a father.\nEvery year, the Old Cornwall Society meets behind the chamber on Midsummer's Eve and lights a ritual bonfire."

It served as a guidepost also for the European settlers of the Carolina who similarly named it Pilot.Due to the effects of European diseases and attacks by northern Indians, particularly the Seneca, the Saura Indians abandoned the area around 1700. The first European settlers in the area arrived in the late 1740s from Pennsylvania. Settlement in the area was slow due to its isolation. There are numerous accounts in the Records of the Moravians in North Carolina  which related to groups of highwaymen, or bandits, who used the mountains as a refuge throughout the 1750s and 1760s.\nAfter serving as a commercial tourist attraction, Pilot Mountain became a North Carolina state park in 1968. It was established as a state park in order to protect the mountain and surrounding lands from being overdeveloped. The Pilot Mountain Preservation and Park Committee purchased the land from Mrs. J. W. Beasley by raising funds and acquired a grant from the federal government. Additional lands along the Yadkin River were purchased in 1970. Further purchases have brought Pilot Mountain State Park to a total size of 3,703 acres (14.99 km2).On November 8, 2012, a prescribed burn of 70 acres got out of control leading to a wildfire on the mountain's steep western slope.In November 27, 2021, a massive wildfire broke out across Pilot Mountain State Park that has since grown to over 300 acres."

The site was previously owned by Acraman and Company and was involved in the manufacture of corrugated-iron and pre-fabricated buildings, which were exported around the world and particular to settlers in Australia. By 1878 the factory employed 400 men and produced 1000 tons of galvanised iron sheet a month.  The company also diversified into making constructional ironwork, exported around the world from Bristol.The building was home to the head office of renewable energy consultancy GL Garrad Hassan.It is an example of the Bristol Byzantine style and various of the buildings have Grade II listed building status.The company offices are Grade II* listed. The offices were built in a Gothic style with a domed atrium decorated with golden Doulton tiles. The offices have wood panelling and throughout the building are elaborate decorations.In January 2018, the building was leased by Colliers International on behalf of a private landlord to the newly founded film production company, Screenology.

Although its total area is only 370 square kilometres (141 sq mi), the lake spreads over a considerable extent of territory, due to long irregular bays and arms that extend on all sides of Kississing Lake. Capes, points, and peninsulas of all lengths, sizes and shapes project into it. The main part of the lake, as well as all its bays and arms are filled with numerous rocky islands, both large and small.Since it lies close to the height of land, none of the streams in its vicinity are large, and the country is poorly drained. A great many short streams draining small lakes or chains of lakes flow into it, but its principal affluent is the Kississing River, which enters at its southwest angle. It is drained by the continuation of the Kississing River which flows out at its northeastern arm and follows a northeasterly course, through many lakes, to its junction with the Churchill River.Kississing Lake lies on the Pre-Cambrian rocks of the Canadian Shield. The surrounding country has low elevation, with isolated rocky hills rising from 15 to 76 metres (50 to 250 ft) above the general level, although hills of the latter height are uncommon. Interspersed between the hills are lakes and swamps. Typical trees found there are spruce, jack pine, poplar, birch, and tamarack."

By 1870, the Cold Lake Post was abandoned.In the late 19th century, a M\u00e9tis road allowance community developed on the lake, known as Cold Lake.The first geological exploration of Kississing Lake was done in 1899 by D. B. Dowling of the Geological Survey of Canada. The discovery of mineral deposits in the Flin Flon area stimulated interest in the whole region, and prospectors worked their way northward to Kississing Lake, guided by M\u00e9tis from the Cold Lake community. In 1923, deposits of copper-zinc sulphides were staked on the east shore of the lake, which were developed into the Sherritt-Gordon Mine. The Town of Sherridon formed nearby. Following the discovery of these minerals, the lake was mapped by the Topographical Survey of Canada in 1928. Around the same time, J. F. Wright of the Geological Survey undertook a further survey, mapping the area around the lake and examining the various deposits that had been discovered up to that time.The Sherridon mine closed in 1951, after having processed approximately 7.7 Mt of pyritic ore.  Weathering of the mine's tailings has released sulphate, metals, and acid into surface and ground water ever since, which run into and contaminated the adjacent Camp Lake. When levels on Camp Lake are high, such as during seasonal spring melts, its rusty-coloured water leaches into the clear blue Kississing Lake. High levels of contaminants have been found in the bottom sediments of Kississing Lake extending over an area of 9.5 square kilometres (3.7 sq mi) from Camp Lake's inflow.\n\n\n== References =="

In addition to Adalberto's residence, it also housed a convent with 12 Benedictine monks and the church of Sant'Apollonio. It was protected by a triple line of walls; located between the outer two layers of defense were the barracks and the residences of the servants.\nDuring the Middle Ages, it was one of the most formidable castles in Italy. In 950 Adelaide of Italy, the widow of King Lothair II, took refuge there; Berengar II of Ivrea unsuccessfully besieged the castle for three years. During the Investiture Controversy in 1077, the castle formed the venue for the reconciliation between Henry IV and Gregory VII. The latter had friendly relations with the then-owner, Matilda of Tuscany, who established that her lands should be assigned to the Church after her death (1115). Her heirs, however, would have none of it.\nIn 1255, troops of Reggio destroyed the castle and the church. It was returned to the Canossa family. After the death of Giberto da Correggio in 1321, it was again a possession of Reggio until 1402, when Simone, Guido and Alberto Canossa gained it back; in 1409, however, they ceded it to the House of Este, who (apart a short period under Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma in 1557) held it until 1796.\nIn 1502 Ercole I d'Este named the poet Ludovico Ariosto as castellan. He resided here for six months. In 1593 Canossa was assigned as fief to the Counts Rondinelli. In 1642 Duke Francesco I entrusted it to the Valentini. The latter were ousted in 1796 by the rebellious local population, who joined the Republic of Reggio.\n\nAfter being returned to the Valentini, in 1878 the Castle was acquired by the Italian State, and was declared a national monument."

The City of Toronto government funded the half-million-dollar renovation of the building.In 2015, with its building about to be demolished and replaced by condominiums, MOCCA hosted an interactive exhibit by Dean Baldwin entitled Queen West Yacht Club. At its former location on Queen West, the museum functioned as a hub for creative exchange and played a critical role in shaping the city's contemporary art scene. Through a commitment to collaborative partnerships with leading like-minded artists, organizations, institutions, and festivals from Toronto and further afield, MOCCA connected the city to a national and global network of peers.\nMOCCA featured the work of over 1,100 Canadian and other international artists, hosted 200+ exhibitions, and welcomed 40,000 annual visitors. As the lease on Queen West wound down, the need to move provided an opportunity to seek a larger space that could accommodate the museum's ever-growing aspirations and significance.\nIn 2016, the museum changed its name to the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto Canada (MOCA). In September 2018, MOCA moved into a 55,000 square foot facility in a renovated former factory in the Lower Junction district. The museum received funding from the Canada Cultural Spaces Fund.The museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, the Ontario Museum Association, and the Ontario Association of Art Galleries."

With his wife he established an inn, the Sawyers Arms, in 1839 three years after the colony of South Australia was created. He then built the Norfolk Arms on 16 acres (6 ha) in 1840 with banquet seating for 150. He moved to Adelaide and sold the Norfolk Arms in 1842, at which point it was known as The Crafers Inn. A new hotel was built on the site in 1880, remaining into the 21st century as The Crafers Inn, but the original building was burned down in 1926. At the time the area at the foot of nearby Mount Lofty was known as the Tiers, infamous for being the haunt of numerous Tiersmen and woodcutters on the run from authorities in Adelaide.The historic Crafers Primary School was first established in the area in 1865 by Mr Edward Smith. The school was initially located in small premises in Atkinson Road, and then moved to its present location in Piccadilly Road in 1928. The historic stone and brick building was opened on 31 August of that year. The late 1970s saw extensive upgrading of the school facilities under Principal Allan Stanley-Smith, including construction of the Ruth Beare Hall in 1976 named after Ruth Beare who taught at the school from 1937 to 1944 and 1947 to 1975.The Church of the Epiphany, Epiphany Place, Crafers has played a prominent role in the life of the district since it was built in 1878 on land donated by Henry Scott.\nFor many years Crafers was well known for being the start point of the South Eastern Freeway linking Adelaide with the town of Murray Bridge, and to the Princes Highway leading to Melbourne. It wasn't until 2000 that the Heysen Tunnels project was completed to extend the freeway to Glen Osmond on the outskirts of Adelaide. Prior to the tunnel opening, the winding road from Adelaide to Glen Osmond via Eagle On The Hill was frequently the scene of horrific vehicle accidents, often involving semi-trailers.The Mount Lofty Botanic Garden is nestled in the hills behind Crafers. The gardens, opened in 1977, include an extensive mix of European and Australian native plants and are at their finest in the spring months.On 16 February 1983, Crafers was hard hit by the Ash Wednesday bushfires. Many homes adjacent to bushland on the western side of the suburb were destroyed (as well as the Anglican theological college and priory of St Michael's House) as the fire came roaring out of the then Cleland National Park, and the devastation would have been much worse if a change in weather had not occurred right when the township of Crafers itself was being threatened. A memorial on Mount Lofty Summit is dedicated to those in the Adelaide Hills who lost their lives that day.Crafers is under the administration of the Adelaide Hills Council, and is in the state electoral district of Bragg and the federal electorate of Mayo. Crafers West is in the state electoral district of Heysen."

In that same year, he founded two other universities for the southern provinces as well, alongside Ghent University: University of Li\u00e8ge and State University of Leuven. \nAfter the Belgian revolution of 1830, the newly formed Belgian state began to administer Ghent University. In 1930, UGent became the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium. Previously, French (and, even earlier, Latin) had been the standard academic language in what was Universit\u00e9 de Gand.

In 1608 a document \"Men & Armour\",  compiled by John Smyth (1567\u20131641), the Steward of the Gloucestershire lands of Lord Berkeley, recorded that the majority of the men in the village were weavers and others being husbandmen (farmers) or tailors. Ecclesiastically the village was part of the Thornbury Parish and was served by a Chapel of Ease, which was recorded as being dilapidated during the 18th century. In 1860 the present St George's Church was built a short distance from where the Chapel of Ease stood. The organist Charles Harford Lloyd served in the village in his youth. Registers containing marriages, baptisms and burials at Falfield Parish Church are in existence from 1860. Prior to this date they are included under Thornbury Parish records.\nAnciently a settlement called \"Mars\" was associated with Falfield. However it has not been determined where this settlement existed, despite research.\nA large part of the village is Eastwood Park, anciently a deer park belonging to Thornbury Castle in the 16th century. Later names associated with owners of Eastwood were Tyndale, Ashfield, Rogers, Jenkinson and Watts. More recently it came into the ownership of the Ministry of Defence followed by the Department of Health and is now run as a Conference and Training Centre.\nOther older constructions in the village are: Green Farm whose origins are medieval, Heneage Farm - 16th century, Sundayshill Farm probably 17th century, Oakhall Farm, Moorslade Farm where a more modern building has now replaced the older farmhouse mentioned in 16th century documents. Whitfield House and Pool Farm in Whitfield are also worthy of mention. Brinkmarsh Farm, now (quite recently) demolished was a fine Elizabethan building with ball finials. In what is known as Mill Lane is a mill which has been on the present site for four or five hundred years, probably longer.\nA women's prison, HM Prison Eastwood Park, is located in the Falfield area.\nThe village appears to lack a manor house, possibly Heneage Court could have been such, but little of its history is known. Cannonballs found in the roof suggest its existence in the 16th century. Names connected with Heneage Court are: Skey, Hale, Montague Williams and Russell Thomas. Edward Warren laid out the gardens, pleasure grounds and woodland for Russell Thomas in 1913."

The southern tip of the lake is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Peters Canal, built for shipping traffic in the 1860s.\nThe restricted channels to the ocean cause a reduction in tidal range.Seaweed populations resemble those found in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The warm waters are suitable for eastern oyster. Fish species include the blackspotted stickleback, white hake, blueback herring, Greenland cod, and introduced  rainbow trout.

        "content": "Cobham was a small town in Surry County, Virginia. It was established by an Act of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1691, when each county in the Virginia Colony was directed set aside 50 acres (200,000 m2) of land for a town. Storehouses were to be built for products imported and tobacco to be exported. It was ordered that the county sell half-acre lots for its citizens to inhabit the town. It was located at the mouth of Gray's Creek at the James River across and somewhat downstream from Jamestown. It was probably named for Cobham, in Surrey, England.\nCobham was active during the 18th and early 19th centuries, but eventually became one of the Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia. According to the Surry County Historical Society, \"today there is little evidence of the town, which became mostly farmland.\" The society reports that \"farmers, while plowing the fields, have run into old foundations, as well as finding locks, broken china, and even a long-barreled pistol.\"\nThere is also a Cobham in eastern Albemarle County, Virginia.  It is located at the intersection of Route 22 (Louisa Road) and Route 640 (St. John's Road / Cobham Station Lane), roughly halfway between Charlottesville and Louisa.  The unincorporated community consists of horse farms and homes.  Cobham had a train station until the early 20th Century, and one building remains next to the train tracks, thought to have been a feed store.  The old train station building was moved to another site near Gordonsville where it is used as a home.  The original one-story general store near the tracks was moved about two hundred feet up to Route 22, and with the addition of a two-story building in 1936, served as the Cobham General Store and Post Office until the mid-1990s.  After serving other purposes, such as a tack store and internet business, the building was converted to a home in 2002."

The seaport will be linked to a port in Songkhla on the Gulf of Thailand. The port will be capable of accommodating 825,000 TEU of cargo per year as well as supertankers. It would mean that vessels would not have to sail through the Malacca Straits, notorious for pirate attacks, to reach deep seaports at Laem Chabang or Bangkok. Construction of the port would involve the creation of an artificial island 430 m wide and one kilometre long, an area of 292 rai about four kilometres offshore connected by a bridge. The project includes the construction of roads, port facilities and railway lines, all totalling about 4,734 rai (757 hectares).In his televised address of 17 April 2014, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, once again proposed that the project go ahead. The project has been vociferously opposed by environmental groups and many local residents. Prayut said the port would be Thailand's gateway to the Andaman Sea, linking the country with Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. He went on to say, \"I ask that conflicts in this area be halted. The government will help those affected by this project.\" Locals say marine traffic, pollution and contamination from logistic and petroleum activities will ruin the environment. The seaport and shipping lanes encroach on Mu Ko Phetra National Park, a source of local food and tourist revenue for locals. Construction of the seaport would mean that some of the national park would lose its protected status.A strategic environmental assessment (SEA) was initiated in 2003, to be submitted in April 2016 at a cost of 50 million baht. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was completed and approved in June 2009. At that time the project's owner, the Marine Department, was ordered to conduct an environmental and health impact assessment (EHIA), budgeted at 118 million baht. The EHIA was started in March 2015.In July 2018 the Ministry of Transport \"shelved\" the 9.7 billion baht project \"...to avoid fuelling conflicts between residents and state officials,...\" The port's construction would have required the expropriation of about 7,400 rai of land close to Ko Petra Marine National Park. A government source said, \"...it is about time to shelve the project because we cannot proceed with conducting an environmental impact assessment and public hearings as local villagers usually refuse to participate,...\" The suspension of the project immediately raised suspicions that the move was a ploy by the government to revive its popularity ahead of the 2019 elections after a series of public relations set-backs. A Bangkok Post editorial explained that, \"...in Thailand, 'being shelved' is a synonym for buying time\u2014most controversial projects re-emerge after public attention fades.\" As predicted by the Bangkok Post, in December 2019, the project was revived."

        "content": "The Mount Shasta Wilderness is a 38,200-acre (155 km2) federally designated wilderness area located 5 miles (8.0 km) east  of Mount Shasta City in northern California. The US Congress passed the 1984 California Wilderness Act that set aside the Mount Shasta Wilderness. The US Forest Service is the managing agency  as the wilderness  is within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The area is named for and is dominated by the Mount Shasta volcano which reaches a traditionally quoted height of 14,162 feet (4,317 m) above sea level, but official sources give values ranging from 14,104 feet (4,299 m) from one USGS project, to 14,179 feet (4,322 m) via the NOAA.  Mount Shasta is one of only two peaks in the state over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) outside the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. The other summit is White Mountain Peak in the Great Basin of east-central California.The Wintun Glacier is located on Mount Shasta and is the lowest-elevation glacier in the state, lying at 9,100 feet (2,800 m) elevation and extending to the summit.The  smaller volcanic cone of Shastina (12,270 ft) lies one mile (1.6 km) west of Mount Shasta and was formed after the ice-age glaciers melted.\nThe wilderness protects both pristine forests and areas that were intensively logged and roaded\nin the past. Although less than half of the mountain remains roadless,  Mount Shasta Wilderness is still the premier destination for a variety of activities from mountaineering, day-hiking, and  backpacking to cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and ski mountaineering. It is valued for the many scenic, geologic and recreational attributes including glaciers, lava flows, hot springs, waterfalls and forests of Shasta red fir, sugar pine and other conifers."

        "content": "Being a high, solitary and very large mountain with a base diameter of 17 miles (27 km),  Mount Shasta can create its own weather patterns which hikers must be aware of. Also, falling rocks are a major danger above timberline. The best time of year for hiking Mount Shasta is June and July, when routes are still snow-covered. Although there is no designated trail to the summit, many cross-country routes ascend to the mountaintop and all require experience in traversing ice and snow.\nThere are ten trailheads giving access to the wilderness and several short trails leading up the slopes of Mount Shasta with the so-called  Shasta Summit Trail (or Avalanche Gulch) being the most popular. This trail, although the \"easiest\" of the routes, still requires the use of ice axe and crampons.  There are four major glaciers and three smaller glaciers radiating from the summit in addition to lava flows on the northern flank composed of andesite and basalt.\nA parking permit is required as well as a free wilderness permit and, if attempting a hike above 10,000 feet (3,000 m), a  Summit Pass for each climber must be purchased. Human waste must be packed out, and all principles of Leave No Trace etiquette employed. Some restrictions include no dogs in the wilderness, a limit of 10 people in a group and no wood campfires."

        "content": "Forested areas include pure stands of red fir as well as mixed conifer forests of white fir, Douglas-fir, sugar pine, incense cedar and at higher elevations, western white pine.  The lava flows on the northeast flank have mountain mahogany and juniper. Underbrush consists of pinemat manzanita, greenleaf manzanita, tanoak, chinquapin, and snowbrush.  From 8,000 feet (2,400 m) to timberline are krummholz forms of whitebark pine.\nWildlife include the ubiquitous black bear, coyote, ground squirrel, deer, golden eagles, prairie falcons and red-tail hawks.\nCommon wildflowers are  Shasta lily, miner's lettuce, showy phlox and mountain violet among others.\nNotable rare plants in the Mount Shasta Wilderness and surrounding area include Mt. Shasta arnica (Arnica viscosa), Siskiyou Indian paintbrush (Castilleja miniata ssp. elata) and Shasta owl's clover (Orthocarpus pachystachyus). The Siskiyou Indian paintbrush is hemiparasitic, meaning  that the plant obtains water and nutrients from the roots of other plants, then manufactures food by photosynthesis. The Shasta owl's clover (Orthocarpus pachystachyus) of the family Scrophulariaceae is critically imperiled and was believed to be extinct. First described in 1848 by  Harvard University botanist Asa Gray, the plant was not collected again until 1913. Known only from  two reports from the Shasta Valley of northern California, it could not be relocated despite repeated searches of the moist meadows and vernal pools where it was thought originally to have been found. In May, 1996,  botanist Dean Taylor of the University of California, Berkeley, rediscovered the evasive plant on the higher, drier ground of a sagebrush-covered hillside. But even in this habitat the wildflower appears to be extraordinarily rare. Taylor was able to find only eight individual plants of the owl\u2019s-clover."

        "content": "The abbey grew into a major centre of learning, commerce and agriculture. Among the monks from the abbey was St. Virgilius (Feargal or Farrell), a noted geometer and astronomer who was abbot before he left Ireland and built the cathedral at Salzburg in Austria in the 8th century.  He was canonized in 1233.The Annals of Inisfallen note that \"Repose of Scandl\u00e1n grandson of Tadc, abbot of Achad B\u00f3\" happened in the year 782.A daughter house of Aghaboe was later built at Kilkenny, the capital of Osraige. The Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111, which first divided Ireland into territorial dioceses, included both Aghaboe and Kilkenny in the Diocese of Ossory, with the episcopal see at Kilkenny, whose abbey church became St Canice's Cathedral. The erroneous belief that the see was originally at Aghaboe and later transferred to Kilkenny is traced by John Bradley to a 16th-century misinterpretation of a 13th-century property transfer. The original Aghaboe monastery burned in 1234, and was rebuilt as an Augustinian priory.In 1346 \"The one eyed Diarmaid Mac Giollaph\u00e1draig ... aided by the U\u00ed C\u00e9arbhail ... burned the town of Aghaboe and the cemetery and church and cruelly forsaking St. Canice, abbot, patron of the neighbourhood and found of the place, he, like a degenerate son to his father, burnt and completely destroyed with the crullest fire, the saint's shrine with his bones and relics.\".  This event was very likely accidental; Aghaboe Abbey had been long under the protection of the Mac Giollaph\u00e1draigs of Upper Ossory and its burning occurred during a Mac Giollaph\u00e1draig attack on the Norman fortifications which had been built next to the abbey, and which can still be seen today.  The ruins on the site belong to a Dominican friary founded in 1382 by Finghan MacGillapatrick, Lord of Upper Ossory. The church, which was conserved by the local community, contains a beautifully carved three-light window in the east wall.The abbey was suppressed in 1540.  In 1984, Dr. Jakob Mayr archbishop of Salzburg visited the abbey, in honour of St. Vergilius.  In 1994, Irish President Mary McAleese visited the abbey, and in 2001 the Austrian ambassador, Dr. Paul Leifer also visited.  It has also been a place of recurrent heritage pilgrimage by the members of the Fitzpatrick-Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig Clan Society.The civil parish of Aghaboe and the Roman Catholic parish of Aghaboe, which differ greatly from each other in extent, are both named after the abbey."
