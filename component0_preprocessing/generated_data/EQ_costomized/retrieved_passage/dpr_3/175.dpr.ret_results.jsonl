The singer asserted greater creative control over the project \u2014 as a co-producer and composer of the material \u2014 compared to her previous work, assisted by Brothers in Rhythm, Manic Street Preachers, David Ball and Rob Dougan.\nInfluenced by the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s, sonically, Impossible Princess is a departure from Minogue's previous work. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from dance music, including trip hop, electronica, and rock. Lyrically, the album focuses on Minogue's self-discovery after a series of trips worldwide and delves into freedom of expression, relationships, and emotions.\nUpon its release, critical and public reception of Impossible Princess was divided over its new musical direction and Minogue's intimate lyrics. Commercially, the album reached the top 10 in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom; the British media, however, mocked its lack of success in Europe. Four singles were released from the album, including two UK top-20 entries \"Did It Again\" and \"Breathe\". Minogue embarked on the Intimate and Live tour in 1998 to support the album.\nIn retrospect, various commentators have cited Impossible Princess as Minogue's most personal and misunderstood work. Despite this, Minogue has said she would never create another studio album of personal songs like Impossible Princess.

Because of the impact of her death, Minogue and Deconstruction felt the album's title was inappropriate and delayed its release for three months. The album also missed the planned January 1998 release. Frustrated with the constant delays, Minogue came to an agreement with her label to re-title it Kylie Minogue in Europe and the United Kingdom. It is her third self-titled studio album, following her debut in 1988 and her 1994 album.

The following month, Impossible Princess was produced in both CD and cassette formats in Russia and Poland. The standard edition of Impossible Princess was finally made available in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in early January 1998, and was issued in Europe and the United Kingdom in March that year. The following month, BMG distributed it as a cassette tape in Malaysia, whilst the standard edition with new artwork was released in Taiwan. Deconstruction cancelled plans to release Impossible Princess in North America following the sudden closure of her US distributor Imago Records in late 1994.In May 2003, Impossible Princess was remastered by Festival Mushroom in Australia and New Zealand, and BMG for European and UK regions, as a double CD album; the release contained a bonus disc featured remixes and three unreleased recordings: \"Love Takes Over Me\", \"Tears\", and \"This Girl\".

In October 2022, 25 years after its original release, BMG released the album for the first time on vinyl. Using its original title Impossible Princess, the 25th Anniversary edition was reissued with three different coloured wax pressings and a limited edition Picture Disc variant.Because of constant delays in 1997, Mushroom Records premiered six of the album tracks\u2014\"Some Kind of Bliss\", \"Too Far\", \"Say Hey\", \"Limbo\", \"I Don't Need Anyone\", and \"Did It Again\"\u2014on a special sample compact disc in Australia. Deconstruction conducted a similar promotional campaign in Europe and distributed six different songs on a sample cassette tape. Live and Other Sides was released accompanied by Australian releases of the album at HMV in 1998, with two unreleased Impossible Princess tracks, one unreleased Kylie Minogue track, and three live tracks. Another EP, Other Sides, featured the two B-sides, \"Love Takes Over Me\" and \"Tears\" and an unreleased Impossible Princess track, \"Take Me with You\". Minogue's fourth remix album, Mixes, includes singles from the album; it was released in the UK in August 1998. In Australia, the remix album was replaced by Impossible Remixes, featuring the previously unreleased \"Breathe (TNT Club Mix)\".

He graduated from Delaware Township High School in Delaware Township (now Cherry Hill), New Jersey, and played college football for the Syracuse Orange.  While a student-athlete at Syracuse University, \"he helped organize the school's boycott of Southern schools whose stadiums were segregated.\"In the NFL, he had one career reception which went for a touchdown. He caught a 29-yard touchdown pass from Dick Shiner in the fourth quarter of a game on October 10, 1965 at District of Columbia Stadium.Following his football career, Hunter attended law school at UC Berkeley School of Law and became an attorney.  One of the youngest United States Attorneys in history, he was appointed to serve the Northern District of California, where he prosecuted high-profile federal defendants including members of Hells Angels and the Black Panther Party. Hunter was named the executive director of the NBPA in 1996.Hunter was criticized for employing many family members within the NBPA.  An external audit initiated by Derek Fisher uncovered numerous irregularities, and a select committee of NBA players unanimously ousted Hunter from his position on February 16, 2013, during the NBA All-Star break.

For the second pressing of March 6, 1967, the album was reissued as Atco SD 33-200A with the hit as the lead track, dropping \"Baby Don't Scold Me\" and slightly reconfiguring the running order. \"Baby Don't Scold Me\" has never been reissued in stereo; all compact disc releases feature only the mono mix of this track.\nThe album was remastered in HDCD and reissued on June 24, 1997, with two versions on one disc, the mono tracks from Atco 33-200 first with the stereo tracks from SD 33-200A following. Not contained were the stereo mix of \"Baby Don't Scold Me\" from Atco SD 33-200 or the mono mix of \"For What It's Worth\" from Atco 33-200A. Strangely, \"Burned\" has also never been issued in stereo for unknown reasons. It redundantly appears twice on this disc in mono.Recording sessions took place at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles from July 18 to September 11, 1966, with \"For What It's Worth\" recorded at Columbia Studios in Los Angeles on December 5, 1966.\nCash Box said that \"Burned\" has a \"slick, mid-tempo rock arrangement that could catch on big.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

As it was ultimately not included on the soundtrack, the version with additional vocals from Slim Thug was placed on the 2005 Destiny's Child's greatest hits album #1's.

However, it received some rotation on US radio stations, after the release of the first single \"Stand Up for Love\" (2005), which failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100.

Competing artists were given titles to put on their covers including \"Agunzagun\", \"Battle Hymns\", and \"The Battle of Los Angeles\". One of the titles was even a verse from \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d - \"The Riot Be the Rhyme of the Unheard\". Tom Morello eventually used the name \"Battle Hymns\" for a track on his debut album, One Man Revolution in 2007.\n\"Calm Like a Bomb\" is notable as a display of guitarist Tom Morello's creative use of a whammy pedal. Like many of RATM's songs, the song's lyrics take a radical and violent approach to the topic of social inequalities. The song also features a reference to Emiliano Zapata. Tim Commerford uses a combination of a home-made overdrive pedal and the Jim Dunlop 105Q Bass Wah pedal on his bass throughout the song.

I know a coffee shop down on 52nd Street; And I don't need no fancy food and I don't need no fancy wine; And I sure don't need the tears you cry\nThe song's chorus is notable as the title is elongated into the phrase \"Till the next time we say goodbye.\"\n\nYeah, a movie house on 42nd Street, Ain't a very likely place for you and I to meet; Watching the snow swirl around your hair and around your feet; And I'm thinking to myself 'she surely looks a treat'", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_22824", "text": "Recording continued at Jagger's home in Newbury with the use of the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio and finished at Island Recording Studios in London.

It was originally released as the final track on his fifth album, The River.  The version released on The River was recorded at The Power Station in New York in March\u2013April 1980.  As well as being the last track on The River, it was the last song recorded for the album.A melancholic song with a false ending, \"Wreck on the Highway\" features prominent organ and acoustic guitar parts.  The song is structured as a folk ballad with four verses of five lines each.  The rhyme scheme of the verse endings is generally ABCCB, but this is not followed absolutely strictly.  The lyrics describe a man who witnesses a hit-and-run auto accident on a rainy, isolated highway, and is subsequently haunted by the vision and unable to sleep.  After the first three verses focus on the specific incident, the last verse broadens the theme to encompass more universal themes of life and death.  The singer thinks about the life that was lost, and the people who may have loved him, and he knows he will be haunted by the incident for the rest of his life.  Springsteen has explained the theme by stating that after seeing the accident the singer \"realizes that you have a limited number of opportunities to love someone, to do your work, to be part of something, to parent your children, to do something good.\"  It is directly inspired by Roy Acuff's country song of the same name and similar theme from the 1940s, which is a cover version of the 1938 recorded song, \"I Didn't Hear Nobody Pray\", by the Dixon Brothers. While Springsteen's song has elements of a country arrangement, its music is more haunted and less sentimental.Along with the title track, \"Independence Day\" and \"Point Blank\", it is one of the verse-chorus songs on The River that was essentially a short story or character sketch. \"Wreck on the Highway\" and a few other songs on The River, such as the title track and \"Stolen Car\", mark a new direction in Bruce Springsteen's songwriting: these ballads imbued with a sense of hopelessness anticipate his next album, Nebraska, as well as a turn towards pessimism in his overall artistic and personal world-view. Springsteen himself has noted that \"Wreck on the Highway\" is one of the songs reflecting a shift in his songwriting style, linking The River to Nebraska.A slow-tempo song, \"Wreck on the Highway\" has not been particularly common in concert, with about 100 performances in Bruce Springsteen concerts through 2008.  Nearly all of those performances occurred during the 1980\u20131981 River Tour. The song was revived occasionally for electric piano performances on the 2005 solo Devils & Dust Tour. Naturally, the song was played every night during the 2016 \"River Tour\" during which the entire album was played at the outset of each show.\nIn the UK, it was released as the B-side of the single \"Cadillac Ranch\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_22828", "text": "Author Patrick Humphries describes the song as distilling \"the essence of what makes Bruce Springsteen great: a looping, loping and involving melody, heartfelt vocal and acutely visual lyrics.\"  June Skinner Sawyers describes it as \"a perfect song, a masterpiece in miniature, and a haunting meditation on mortality and what it means to be alive.\"  Music critic Clinton Heylin described the version that was released on the album as a \"near-cataleptic coda to 'Drive All Night,'\" the previous song on the album, although Heylin felt that an earlier version of the song, with a faster, \"countrabilly\" arrangement, was more interesting.  Heylin also described the song as Springsteen's \"semi-ironic farewell to albums about cars and girls.\"  Music critic Dave Marsh describes the song as an appropriate closer for The River as it \"pares down the situation from 'Drive All Night'\" of the singer and his lover trying to ignore the distractions around them down \"to one man facing the world again.\"  To Marsh, the singer in \"Wreck on the Highway\" may well have been the hero from other songs on The River such as \"Ramrod,\" \"Cadillac Ranch,\" \"The River\" or \"Stolen Car,\" or even the heroes from earlier Springsteen albums such as Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town, but regardless Marsh feels that \"he sees and speaks and sings for all of them.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

New Order were formed in 1980 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The group began life as a continuation of their former incarnation Joy Division. Joy Division had disbanded after the death of the lead singer Ian Curtis. Gillian Gilbert, who was Morris's girlfriend at the time, soon joined the group and played guitar and keyboards.\nRemarkably, New Order's first eight singles released between 1981 and 1984 were not taken from any album. In most cases they were not even released as a 7-inch, but exclusively available in the radio-unfriendly 12-inch format, an unusual approach for a pop-act in the eighties.\nDespite the high anticipation that surrounded the group, their debut single \"Ceremony\" only peaked at number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The group's following two singles and their debut album met with similar moderate success. It would not be until the release of their fourth single, \"Blue Monday\", that New Order would break into the top 10, with the song peaking at number 9. \"Blue Monday\" became a defining single for the group and caused a sensation, becoming the biggest selling 12-inch single of all time.New Order, like many other post-punk groups of the period, increasingly utilised keyboards, drum machine and sequencers in their music. As a result, they became associated with the synthpop and electronic dance movements of the 1980s. Beginning with Power, Corruption & Lies from 1983, all of the group's studio albums reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The group experienced a lull in popularity in the years 1985 and 1986 but the surprise international popularity of the \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" single re-launched the group across the world. The group cemented their success in 1987 with the single, \"True Faith\", and the compilation album Substance.\nNew Order were at the peak of their popularity in the years 1987 to 1993, with a run of popular singles, including \"Blue Monday 1988\", \"Fine Time\", \"Regret\", \"World (The Price of Love)\" and in 1990 they scored their only number 1 single in the UK with the official England national football team song, \"World in Motion\". The two albums released during these years, Technique and Republic; each charted at number 1 in the UK. It was during this successful period that the group's internal dynamic began to falter. Sumner was not fond of touring, and wanted to take time off from the group and produce a solo album. He formed Electronic with Johnny Marr and the pair released their first single in 1989. Hook formed his own band, Revenge, in 1989, while Morris and Gilbert worked together as The Other Two, primarily scoring soundtracks. Of the three side projects, Sumner's was by far the most successful.\nThe recording and touring of 1993's Republic, their first for London Records, was difficult and intra-band tensions were rife. The group went on hiatus until 1998. In the meantime two compilation albums, The Best of New Order and The Rest of New Order, and several singles were released.\nThe group reconvened in 1998 for the Reading Festival but did not release new material until 2000. The group released the album Get Ready in 2001. It was met with critical warmth, but it was apparent that the group's popularity had lessened. The lead single from the album, \"Crystal\", reached the top 10 in the UK. The film 24 Hour Party People, a humorous chronicle of their label Factory Records, was released in 2002. New Order contributed a new song, \"Here to Stay\", and a re-recording of the Joy Division song \"New Dawn Fades\" with Moby, for the film's soundtrack. The compilation International and four-disc boxset Retro were released in winter 2002. New Order followed Get Ready with Waiting for the Sirens' Call in 2005. During this period Gilbert stepped down from live performances due to family commitments. Phil Cunningham stepped into her role and in 2005 became an official member of the group.\nThe group had intended to release a ninth album soon after Waiting for the Sirens' Call, the majority of which had already been recorded. The lack of enthusiasm inside the group and relative failure of Waiting for the Sirens' Call stalled their career momentum. In 2007, Hook decided to leave the group, and stated that he and Sumner had no further plans to work together. Sumner formed Bad Lieutenant with Cunningham, and Hook formed Freebass. Morris continued to work with Sumner and Cunningham. In 2008, New Order released remastered and expanded editions of their first five albums with the intention of releasing the further three albums in a similar format in the future.\nLost Sirens was released in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2013. It is an eight-track album of tracks left out of Waiting for the Sirens' Call. On 25 September 2015, the band released a new album, Music Complete. The album was the first without Peter Hook, and was produced mostly by the band themselves, except \"Singularity\" and \"Unlearn This Hatred\", both produced by Tom Rowlands, while \"Superheated\" features additional production by Stuart Price. In 2020, New Order released \"Be a Rebel\", their first non-album single since \"Here to Stay\" in 2002.\nIn the US, the band has sold a certified 2 million albums, and in the UK a certified 1.24 million albums.", "hasanswer": true}]}

After the arms-for-hostages deals hit the news, the increased public awareness of the U.S. government's covert war in Nicaragua prompted Browne to produce and pay for a video for 'Lives in the Balance' well after the album had passed its peak in terms of sales. Discussing the song at the time of the video's release, Browne said, 'I imply that the truth is kept from us on a regular basis. I flat out say the government lies. Well, these things are no longer heresy [sic].'\"Released only as a U.S. 12\" promo and as a 7\" single in Germany, in 1986 the song was associated with American policies in Central America, but within the context of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the song received new life as a single in 2005 when a live version was released from Browne's Solo Acoustic, Vol. 1 album. The song, Mark Coleman says in the Rolling Stone Record Guide, \"is a cutting slice of social observation,\" as demonstrated in the chorus:\nThere are lives in the balance\nThere are people under fire\nThere are children at the cannons\nAnd there is blood on the wire.Jimmy Guterman, in his 1986 Rolling Stone review of the Lives in the Balance album, wrote approvingly of the lyrics of the song: \"For Browne, our crimes in Central America are the clearest example of the wrongheadedness of U.S. foreign policy. 'Who are the ones that we call our friends?'

In Final Fantasy VII, Cloud is a mercenary who wields a large broadsword and claims to have formerly been part of SOLDIER, a group of elite supersoldiers employed by the Shinra Electric Power Company, a megacorporation responsible for draining life from the planet. He later defected from SOLDIER after becoming disillusioned with Shinra, and in an attempt to get paid, he joins the resistance group AVALANCHE in the fight against Shinra and his former superior, the primary antagonist Sephiroth, who aims to annihilate the world.

After VII, Nomura redesigned Cloud for Advent Children, giving him a more realistic appearance alongside new weaponry and a new outfit. For Remake, the team aimed to adapt his classic design for a more realistic artstyle.\nCloud has garnered primarily positive reception from critics, and has been described as one of the most iconic video game protagonists. He has also been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first unreliable narrators and for the game's depiction of his mental disorder. Additionally, he is seen as a messiah figure in both the game and film for opposing Sephiroth's schemes and supported by his allies. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by Famitsu, Guinness, and other organizations. His characterization and design have also influenced other characters, most notably Lightning from Final Fantasy XIII.

However, similar to the conception and recording of Let's Get It On, Gaye had struggled to come up with an album as an appropriate follow-up. And much like Let's Get It On Gaye reached for outside help, this time seeking the assistance of Leon Ware, a singer and songwriter who had found previous success writing hits for fellow Motown alum, including pop singer Michael Jackson and the rhythm and blues group The Miracles. Ware had been working on songs for his own album which he would later issue under the title Musical Massage, a collection of erotic singles Ware had composed with a variety of writers, including Jacqueline Hillard and Arthur \"T-Boy\" Ross, brother of Diana Ross. When Motown CEO Berry Gordy paid a visit to Ware, the songwriter was more than happy to play Gordy his selection of tracks. After hearing a preliminary mix of the songs however, Gordy figured that Ware should let Gaye handle his material.While the majority of the album's songs were conceived by Ware, I Want You was transformed into a biographical centerpiece for Gaye, who was then in a volatile marriage with Anna Gordy, sister to Berry Gordy, and also in a long-standing affair with Janis Hunter, who would later become the mother of his two youngest children. Gaye and Hunter were introduced to each other by producer Ed Townsend in 1973 at Hitsville West, while Townsend and Gaye were recording Let's Get It On. Hunter was 17 years old while Gaye was seventeen years her senior at the time Townsend introduced them. In his book Mercy, Mercy Me: The Art, Loves, and Demons of Marvin Gaye, the author and music writer Michael Eric Dyson elaborated on the relationship between I Want You and Gaye's affair with Hunter:\n\n\"I Want You is unmistakably a work of romantic and erotic tribute to the woman he deeply loved and would shortly marry, Janis Hunter. Gaye's obsession with the woman in her late teens is nearly palpable in the sensual textures that are the album's aural and lyrical signature. Their relationship was relentlessly passionate and emotionally rough-hewn; they played up each other's strengths, and played off each other's weaknesses.\"\nThough it was often hinted that Let's Get It On was the album Gaye had dedicated to her, Marvin has stated that this album was dedicated to Hunter, who is believed to have been in the studio when he recorded it. According to music critics, her presence may have increased the emotion in Ware's and Gaye's conception of I Want You. From Gaye's first recordings of I Want You to the album's release in 1976, Hunter and Gaye married and divorced in the span of three short years. Having gone mostly silent since the years of Gaye's death, Janis broke her silence in 2013 by releasing a book titled, After the Dance: My Life with Marvin Gaye where she recalls her turbulent and often violent relationship with Marvin.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When talking about the song \"Save the Day\", Gomez stated \"Do you ever have moments where you don't ever want them to end? I've had those moments. It's about saving those moments and never wanting it to go away.\" The song \"Write Your Name\" is about the feeling of falling in love. Gomez described B.E.A.T. by saying \"The song is cool and the lyrics are great, but it was more, 'I can't wait to perform this song onstage because I love the way I feel when I hear this song.' It's just dope.\" Gomez later stated that \"Undercover\" was her favorite song on the album, commenting \"I've never had the confidence to do different licks and melody changes.

Gomez has listed Britney Spears and Janet Jackson as some of the album's biggest influences, and later cited Skrillex, Taylor Swift, and Christina Aguilera as major influences on the record. She listed dubstep producer Skrillex as an influence to the album, with him having previously worked on the soundtrack for Gomez's film Spring Breakers. She later stated \"Doing Spring Breakers was really fun, because Skrillex and Cliff Martinez did the soundtrack, and [Skrillex] kind of inspired me with a baby dubstep, because I have a few songs that have that.\" Jim Farber of New York Daily News noted influences of Spears, Jennifer Lopez, and Janet Jackson, although going on to say \"Gomez's writer and producers have aped other stars' tricks gamely enough to create a pretty good time.

However, similar to the conception and recording of Let's Get It On, Gaye had struggled to come up with an album as an appropriate follow-up. And much like Let's Get It On Gaye reached for outside help, this time seeking the assistance of Leon Ware, a singer and songwriter who had found previous success writing hits for fellow Motown alum, including pop singer Michael Jackson and the rhythm and blues group The Miracles. Ware had been working on songs for his own album which he would later issue under the title Musical Massage, a collection of erotic singles Ware had composed with a variety of writers, including Jacqueline Hillard and Arthur \"T-Boy\" Ross, brother of Diana Ross. When Motown CEO Berry Gordy paid a visit to Ware, the songwriter was more than happy to play Gordy his selection of tracks. After hearing a preliminary mix of the songs however, Gordy figured that Ware should let Gaye handle his material.While the majority of the album's songs were conceived by Ware, I Want You was transformed into a biographical centerpiece for Gaye, who was then in a volatile marriage with Anna Gordy, sister to Berry Gordy, and also in a long-standing affair with Janis Hunter, who would later become the mother of his two youngest children. Gaye and Hunter were introduced to each other by producer Ed Townsend in 1973 at Hitsville West, while Townsend and Gaye were recording Let's Get It On. Hunter was 17 years old while Gaye was seventeen years her senior at the time Townsend introduced them. In his book Mercy, Mercy Me: The Art, Loves, and Demons of Marvin Gaye, the author and music writer Michael Eric Dyson elaborated on the relationship between I Want You and Gaye's affair with Hunter:\n\n\"I Want You is unmistakably a work of romantic and erotic tribute to the woman he deeply loved and would shortly marry, Janis Hunter. Gaye's obsession with the woman in her late teens is nearly palpable in the sensual textures that are the album's aural and lyrical signature. Their relationship was relentlessly passionate and emotionally rough-hewn; they played up each other's strengths, and played off each other's weaknesses.\"\nThough it was often hinted that Let's Get It On was the album Gaye had dedicated to her, Marvin has stated that this album was dedicated to Hunter, who is believed to have been in the studio when he recorded it. According to music critics, her presence may have increased the emotion in Ware's and Gaye's conception of I Want You. From Gaye's first recordings of I Want You to the album's release in 1976, Hunter and Gaye married and divorced in the span of three short years. Having gone mostly silent since the years of Gaye's death, Janis broke her silence in 2013 by releasing a book titled, After the Dance: My Life with Marvin Gaye where she recalls her turbulent and often violent relationship with Marvin.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to the song, Carroll \"had borne 10 children\", though other accounts range from 8 to 11:\u200a1\u200a. She was president of a black social club.Already drunk before he got to the Emerson Hotel that night, the 6'2\" Zantzinger had assaulted employees at Eager House, a prestigious Baltimore restaurant, with the same cane. The cane was a 25-cent toy. At the Spinsters' Ball, he called a 30-year-old waitress a \"nigger\" and hit her with the cane; she fled the room in tears. Moments later, after ordering a bourbon that Carroll did not bring immediately, Zantzinger cursed her, called her a \"nigger\", then \"you black son of a bitch\", and struck her on the shoulder and across the head with the cane. In the words of the court notes: \"He asked for a drink and called her 'a black bitch', and 'black s.o.b'. She replied, 'Just a moment' and started to prepare his drink. After a delay of perhaps a minute, he complained about her being slow and struck her a hard blow on her shoulder about half-way between the point of her shoulder and her neck.\" She handed him his drink. After striking Carroll, he attacked his own wife, knocking her to the ground and hitting her with his shoe.Within five minutes from the time of the blow, Carroll leaned heavily against the barmaid next to her and complained of feeling ill. Carroll told co-workers, \"I feel deathly ill, that man has upset me so.\" The barmaid and another employee helped Carroll to the kitchen. Her arm became numb, her speech thick. She collapsed and was hospitalized. Carroll died eight hours after the assault. Her autopsy showed hardened arteries, an enlarged heart and high blood pressure. A spinal tap confirmed brain hemorrhage as the cause of death. She died in Mercy Hospital at 9 a.m. on February 9, 1963.\nZantzinger was initially charged with murder. His defense was that he had been extremely drunk, and he claimed to have no memory of the attack. His charge was reduced to manslaughter and assault, based on the likelihood that it was her stress reaction to his verbal and physical abuse that led to the intracranial bleeding, rather than blunt-force trauma from the blow that left no lasting mark. On August 28, Zantzinger was convicted of both charges and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. Time magazine covered the sentencing:In June, after Zantzinger's phalanx of five topflight attorneys won a change of venue to a court in Hagerstown, a three-judge panel reduced the murder charge to manslaughter. Following a three-day trial, Zantzinger was found guilty. For the assault on the hotel employees: a fine of $125. For the death of Hattie Carroll: six months in jail and a fine of $500. The judges considerately deferred the start of the jail sentence until September 15, to give Zantzinger time to harvest his tobacco crop.\nAfter the sentence was announced, the New York Herald Tribune conjectured he was given a sentence that short to keep him out of the largely black state prison, reasoning his notoriety would make him a target for abuse there. Zantzinger served his time in the comparative safety of the Washington County county jail, some 70 miles (110 km) from the scene of the crime. In September, the Herald Tribune quoted Zantzinger on his sentence: \"I'll just miss a lot of snow.\" His then-wife, Jane, was quoted saying, \"Nobody treats his niggers as well as Billy does around here.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Morrison wrote it in a stream of consciousness in the same vein as some of his earlier works, particularly those on Astral Weeks. The  song's narrative moves from France to San Francisco, Morrison's place of residence at the time, to Belfast, where he grew up, to New York City (\"52nd Street apartment\").\nSaint Dominic's Preview has been described as one of his most allusive, containing wide-ranging references including The Troubles, Morrison's pre-fame career cleaning windows, Notre-Dame cathedral and the vicissitudes of the recording industry. The song also mentions Edith Piaf, Irish poet W. B. Yeats, country singer Hank Williams and the California supermarket chain Safeway.

Instrumentally it is very similar to 'Tupelo Honey'. The arrangement and vocals are joyously full-bodied ...

Jim Gaines, employed at the Wally Heider Studios, was the engineer at the session. Pianist Tom Salisbury made the arrangements for the song, along with  \"I Will Be There\" and \"Redwood Tree\", which were also recorded at the final session. Salisbury had perfect pitch, which made it easy for him to write down the charts over the phone with instruction from Morrison. Salisbury was happy with the first take, even though ten takes were eventually made during the session. Doug Messenger recalled: \"When we recorded \"St. Dominic's,\" every take was more powerful that the last. Quite an experience. Mallaber kept driving the band harder and harder.\"Producer Ted Templeman and his assistant Donn Landee were not present at the recording of \"Saint Dominic's Preview\", but oversaw the overdubs and retakes that were made to the song.

'. The electric guitar had to be rerecorded because of unwanted sound leaking into the microphone. Doug Messenger was no longer part of Morrison's band when the overdubs were being recorded, so numerous guitarists, including Ronnie Montrose, were brought in to play it. None produced the sound wanted, so Messenger was recalled, and managed to complete the overdub to Morrison's satisfaction in one take. Morrison also rerecorded his vocals, which, over the new backing, allowed him to react more to the music; \"no regrets\" was replaced with \"ne regrette rien\" and the vowel sound of \"wine\" was elongated to \"wi-ee-ine\". In the final recording, \"ne regrette rien\" is replaced by the Latin motto \"non regredior\" (\"I do not retreat\").", "hasanswer": false}]}

The song is guided by the shifting guitar of Robert Fripp, but it is in the tense violin of David Cross and the chaotic percussion of Jamie Muir that Part I is defined.  The track goes through numerous varied acts and passages, with somber moments and a calm violin solo falling alongside periods of heightened aggression where Fripp's guitar borders on heavy metal and Muir's clangs reach cacophony. Bird calls, metallic clangs, horns, breaking crockery and tin ripping are all featured in Muir's repertoire, and, along with his percussive contributions, he coined the title \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\". In a 1991 interview, Muir said it was a \"very admirable creative decision\" for Fripp to work with him. Much of the track originated from full-band improvisations that began in 1971, with Cross calling it \"grown\" instead of written. Drummer Bill Bruford said the songs were \"hell\" to make given the deliberate lack of in-studio structure. An early version of Part I recorded by the 1971 lineup appeared as a bonus track on the 40th-anniversary edition of Islands under the name \"A Peacemaking Stint Unrolls\".\n\nWhile the first part is a many-sectioned, dynamic song that has been described as having a \"kitchen-sink sensibility\", \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\" is much more straightforward and riff-focused, with the sole writing credit going to Fripp. PopMatters called the track a \"roller-coaster of wrath and control\". The main riff of part II, which emerged in 1972 during a live performance at Richmond, Kentucky, is heavy and driving, drawing its host album to a dramatic climax. While the guitar in part II may be the most immediately obvious aspect, John Goldsby of Bass Player called the bass in the song something that \"bass players will still be talking about four decades later\". Fripp considered the first two parts of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" as the refinement of his role as composer in King Crimson.According to Fripp, Part I was conceived as the beginning of a King Crimson performance, and Part II as the end. \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\" was performed from 1972 to 1974, predominantly in a shortened seven-minute version that left out most of the violin solo and protracted ending passage. Part I was not performed again until 2014, when it was reintroduced as a setlist staple; it remained there through 2019. The new arrangement featured all of the violin segments played on guitar save for the solo, which was performed by Mel Collins on flute. Part II, alternatively, persisted in King Crimson's sets throughout most of their career.Both the first and second parts of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" have been met with critical acclaim. In 2011, Sean Murphy of PopMatters ranked the \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\" as the eighth best progressive rock song ever. He revised his placement in 2017, putting part I as number fifteen and \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\" as eighty-five.

He was born with a severe hunchback, a bushy eyebrow covering his left eye while the right eye \"disappeared entirely\" behind a giant wart. He was born to a tribe of Romani people (in the novel called \u00e9gyptienne or 'gypsies'), but due to his monstrous appearance he was switched during infancy with an able-bodied baby girl, Agnes. One character in the novel refers to him as animalistic and un-Christian, suggesting he may be the \"offspring of a Jew and a sow\", and thus deserving of death. After being discovered, Quasimodo is exorcised by Agnes's mother (who believed that the Romani people ate her child) and taken to Paris. He is found abandoned in Notre Dame (on the foundlings' bed, where orphans and unwanted children are left to public charity) on Quasimodo Sunday, the First Sunday after Easter, by Claude Frollo, the Archdeacon of Notre Dame, who adopts the baby, names him after the day the baby was found, and brings him up to be the bell-ringer of the cathedral. Due to the loud ringing of the bells, Quasimodo also becomes deaf causing Frollo to teach him sign language. Although he is hated for his deformity, it is revealed that he is kind at heart. Though Quasimodo commits acts of violence in the novel, these are only undertaken when he is instructed by others.\n\nLooked upon by the general populace of Paris as a monster, he believes that Frollo is the only one who cares for him, and frequently accompanies him when the Archdeacon walks out of Notre Dame. Frollo lusts after a beautiful Romani girl named Esmeralda, and enlists Quasimodo in trying to kidnap her. (She is later revealed to be Agnes, the baby Quasimodo was switched with.) Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00e2teaupers arrives to stop the kidnapping and captures Quasimodo, unaware that Quasimodo was merely following Frollo's orders. The deaf judge Florian Barbedienne sentences him to an hour of flogging and another hour of humiliation on the pillory. Phoebus ties Quasimodo up and has Pierre Torterue whip him in front of a jeering crowd. When Quasimodo calls to him for help, Frollo allows Quasimodo to be tortured as punishment for failing him.  When Quasimodo calls for water, a child throws a wet rag at him. Seeing his thirst, Esmeralda approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him and she captures his heart.\nEsmeralda is later entangled in an attempted murder \u2013 committed by Frollo, who had stabbed Phoebus in a jealous rage after spying on Esmeralda and Phoebus having a night of passion \u2013 and is sentenced to be hanged. As she is being forced to pray at the steps of Notre Dame just before being marched off to the gallows, Quasimodo, who has been watching the occasion from an upper balcony in Notre Dame, slides down with a rope, and rescues her by taking her up to the top of the cathedral, where he poignantly shouts \"Sanctuary!\" to the onlookers below.\nEsmeralda is terrified of Quasimodo at first, but gradually recognizes his kind heart and becomes his friend. He watches over her and protects her, and at one point saves her from Frollo when the mad priest sexually assaults her in her room. In one instance Esmeralda also sees Phoebus from the cathedral balcony and pleadingly convinces Quasimodo to go down and look for him, but Phoebus is repulsed by Quasimodo's appearance and refuses to visit Notre Dame to see her.\nAfter an uneasy respite, a mob of Paris's Truands led by Clopin Trouillefou storms Notre Dame, and although Quasimodo tries to fend them off by throwing stones and bricks down onto the mob and even pours deadly molten lead, the mob continues attacking until Phoebus and his soldiers arrive to fight and drive off the assailants. Unbeknownst to Quasimodo, Frollo lures Esmeralda outside, where he has her arrested and hanged. When Quasimodo sees Frollo smiling cruelly at Esmeralda's execution, he turns on his master and throws him to his death from the balcony in rage.\nQuasimodo cries in despair, lamenting \"There is all that I ever loved!\" He then leaves Notre Dame, never to return, and heads for the Gibbet of Montfaucon beyond the city walls, passing by the Convent of the Filles-Dieu, a home for 200 reformed prostitutes, and the leper colony of Saint-Lazare. After reaching the Gibbet, he lies next to Esmeralda's corpse, where it had been unceremoniously thrown after the execution. He stays at Montfaucon, and eventually dies of starvation, clutching the body of the deceased Esmeralda. Years later, an excavation group exhumes both of their skeletons, which have become intertwined. When they try to separate them, Quasimodo's bones crumble to dust.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In a list compiled by Chad Bowar of About.com, Rust in Peace was placed as the best heavy metal album of the 1990s and named a \"thrash masterpiece\". The album was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 33rd Grammy Awards. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\nThe tracks \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" and \"Hangar 18\" have become staples of Megadeth's live set, and are fan favorites. The guitar solo on \"Tornado of Souls\" is considered to be one of the greatest solos in heavy metal music. In 2010, the band announced a 22-show North American tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Rust in Peace. The band performed the entire album at every show. Dates in South and Central America were later added to the tour, due to positive response from fans. In 2010, Shout! Factory released a live recording filmed on the Hollywood Palladium stop of the tour, entitled Rust in Peace Live. It was released on September 7, 2010, in Blu-ray, CD and DVD formats, and debuted at number 161 on the Billboard 200 and number two on the Billboard DVD charts.Rust in Peace in its entirety was released as purchasable downloadable content in the rhythm game Rock Band, a part of their \"Rust in Peace Download Package\". It was released a little more than a year after the release of Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? on the game's download store. A cover version of \"Holy Wars\" by Steve Ouimette was featured in Rock Revolution. \"Holy Wars\" was also featured in Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, while \"Hangar 18\" was featured in Guitar Hero II and as downloadable content for Guitar Hero 5. Both songs have been described as amongst the most difficult songs in the series' history. \"Holy Wars\", \"Hangar 18\" and \"Tornado of Souls\" were also released as downloadable content for Rocksmith 2014\nA sequel to \"Hangar 18\" titled \"Return to Hangar\" later featured on Megadeth's ninth studio album, The World Needs a Hero.", "hasanswer": false}]}

By 1980, Greg Harris and Ed Ponder had left the group, leaving the Burritos as a trio of \"Sneaky\" Pete Kleinow, Gib Guilbeau and Skip Battin. In addition to commitments with the Flying Burrito Brothers, Guilbeau was also working as a songwriter for Criterion Music with John Beland, who Guilbeau knew from his time in the band Swampwater. Guilbeau and Beland wrote some songs and ultimately, Beland was invited to join the Burritos. Beland was reluctant to join the now nearly defunct band, as he was riding strong as lead guitarist with Ricky Nelson who (with Beland's help) was enjoying his own comeback of sorts.\nHowever, after leaving Nelson in the hopes of producing the Burritos, Beland took the Burritos in a more commercial direction, having already written a number of country hits for other artists prior to his joining the FBB. In addition, the band's name at this time was shortened to simply The Burrito Brothers, a suggestion made by Curb Records.\nBeland's song demos, which featured the Burritos on them, eventually made it to Dick Whitehouse at Curb records, who signed the band to a deal with Curb / Epic Records. By December 1980, the band's first single for Curb, \"She's a Friend of a Friend\" reached the US country top 70. Hearts on the Line followed in January 1981 and spawned two further singles, both of which made the US country top 20, \"Does She Wish She Was Single Again?\" and \"She Belongs to Everyone But Me\".

In 1966, Ganz was permitted to take his wife, Magda, and the couple's two sons on a vacation to Italy. Instead, the family went to Vienna, Austria, where they applied for a visa to the United States.

A balloon is placed at the end of a flexible catheter, which is inserted into the pulmonary artery.  Additionally, Ganz had a role in the development of thrombolysis, in which enzymes break down blood clots.Ganz died of natural causes on November 11, 2009, at the age of 90.

But...and it was totally accidental - I didn't mention the beach [or] anything like that [in the lyrics] because that would have regionalized [the song].\" McCann had been working as a staff writer for American Broadcasting Music for roughly a year without composing a high-profile song: (Peter McCann quote:) - \"I played ['Right Time...'] for [boss] Gerry Teifer...For the first time...he let me play [a] whole song through, and then he did something he'd never done before. He said: 'Play that again.' I played it again, and he goes: 'Wait here.' He brought in everybody in the building who was working there and said 'Play it.' I played it, and they all cheered and went nuts. I thought it was just another song I had written, but apparently not.\"\nOriginally written and recorded by Peter McCann for his 1977 self-titled album, \"Right Time of the Night\", which would serve as the B-side for McCann's own 1977 top ten hit \"Do You Wanna Make Love\", featured a distinct second verse that was eventually reworked by Jennifer Warnes; she herself wrote lyrics for a less overtly masculine second verse which McCann rejected, eventually himself writing new second verse lyrics deemed female-friendly. Prior to the release of Warnes's version of \"Right Time\", Bette Midler expressed an interest in recording the song but asked that the bridge be reworked, a stipulation McCann was still working on when Warnes's version reached the charts, at which point work on a Midler version was dropped.\n\"Right Time of the Night\" was one of seven songs which McCann played for Clive Davis, president of Arista Records (for whom Jennifer Warnes recorded) when McCann was making the rounds of auditions in hopes of being signed as a recording artist. McCann would recall Davis saying: \"I don't like you as an artist, but I'm taking six of the seven songs.\" \"Right Time\" was one of the six songs Davis optioned (the one song Davis passed on was \"Do You Wanna Make Love\" which would afford McCann a top ten hit when he recorded it after his October 1976 signing with 20th Century Records).", "hasanswer": false}]}
