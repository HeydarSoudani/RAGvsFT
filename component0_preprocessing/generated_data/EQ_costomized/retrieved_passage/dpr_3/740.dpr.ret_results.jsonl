In 1955 this part of the business was separated out as Bristol Commercial Vehicles Limited. It closed in 1983 when production was moved to its then parent company Leyland.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "740_16902", "text": "The first trams of the Bristol Tramways Company ran in 1875, and in 1906 the company started to operate motor buses to bring extra passengers to their trams. In 1908 the company decided to build bus chassis for its own use, the first one entering service on 12 May.The Motor Department was initially based at the tram depot in Brislington, on the road that leads east from Bristol to Bath. The Car Building Works there had been responsible for erecting electric trams and had gone on to build horse-drawn vehicles for the company. The first motor bodies built there had been three charabanc bodies constructed in 1907 for the Thornycroft buses delivered the previous year. During 1907 the bus fleet was transferred to the tram depot at Filton to the north west of the city. In 1908 the company built its first six buses. The chassis were erected by the Motor Department and three bodies each at Brislington and the company's carriage works in Leek Lane, north Bristol.\nIn 1910 the company decided to build aeroplanes, forming the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, Ltd. The best place for this work was the sheds occupied by the Motor Department at Filton, so motor repairs and construction returned to Brislington. The tram depot proved too small for the volume of work and so a new 4 acres (1.6 ha) site, to be known as the Motor Constructional Works, was purchased nearby in Kensington Hill, Brislington.In May 1914 it supplied its first bus to another operator, a C50 fitted out as a charabanc for Imperial Tramways at Middlesbrough. The two companies shared a chairman, Sir George White, who in January had taken some buses out of service in Bristol to send to Middlesbrough when a rival company had tried to start a competitive service. The Middlesbrough order was followed by a number of trucks for the Royal Navy Air Service.The Great Western Railway bought a controlling interest in the tramway company in 1929 but the bus interests of the railway were transferred to Western National in 1931. This brought Bristol Tramways and its manufacturing activities into the Tilling Group. It was a policy decision by the Tilling Group to adopt the diesel engine as the standard power unit, which started a period of many decades of installing Gardner diesel engines to Bristol chassis. Other companies in the group increasingly turned to Bristol to provide their chassis. Many Bristol chassis were taken to Eastern Coach Works (ECW) at Lowestoft, another member of the Tilling Group, where bodies were added. The un-bodied chassis were moved between the two towns by delivery drivers wearing substantial weatherproof suits.Bristol Commercial Vehicles (BCV) was created in 1943 as a subsidiary of Bristol Tramways. The Transport Act saw the nationalisation of the Tilling Group into the British Transport Commission (BTC) in 1948. BCV and ECW soon found themselves restricted to selling products to other BTC operators. Nationalisation also brought the task of supervision of the Ministry of Supply's motor repair works at Kingswood. In 1955 BCV became an independent company owned by the BTC. Rationalisation of activities saw new body construction cease at Bristol in 1956.Changes in government policy in 1965 allowed the Leyland Motor Corporation to buy some shares in BCV and ECW so that their products could once again be sold to independent operators. The last new chassis to carry a Bristol badge was a VRT/SL double-deck bus built in 1981. For a while the factory continued to build buses with Leyland badges, notably the Olympian which had been designed by the staff at Brislington. All work ended in October 1983 when the final Bristol-built Olympian chassis was sent to ECW to receive its body for Devon General (where it was registered A686 KDV). Work was then transferred to other Leyland factories.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "112_63220", "text": "In 2002, BMC (Turkey), a Turkish commercial vehicle builder, originally set up by the British Motor Corporation to build its designs under licence in the 1950s, began exporting its vehicles to Britain.

The idea gained the attention of his former employer, Eric Lefkofsky, who provided $1 million in seed money to develop the idea. In April 2010, the company was valued at $1.35 billion. According to a December 2010 report conducted by Groupon's marketing association and reported in Forbes magazine and the Wall Street Journal, Groupon was \"projecting that the company is on pace to make $1 billion in sales faster than any other business, ever.\"In its first earnings release as a public company, Groupon reported a 2011 fourth-quarter loss of $9.8 million on an adjusted basis, disappointing investors.

Mason thought that there must be some way to leverage the collective bargaining power of a large number of people. In 2007 Mason launched The Point, a web platform based on the \"tipping point\" principle that would utilize social media to get people together to accomplish a goal. The Point was intended to organize people around some sort of cause or goal. It gained only modest traction in Chicago until a group of users decided their cause would be saving money. They wanted to round up people to buy the same product in order to receive a group discount. Founder Eric Lefkofsky wanted the company to pivot in order to focus entirely on group buying.  Born from The Point, Groupon was launched in November 2008.The name for the e-commerce platform, Groupon is a portmanteau of \"group\" and \"coupon\". Groupon's first deal was a two-pizzas-for-the-price-of-one offer at Motel Bar, a restaurant on the first floor of its building in Chicago.The decision to focus on group buying proved wise. In just a year and a half, Groupon grew from a staff of a few dozen to over 350. Revenue and bookings also grew swiftly, and the company was valued at over $1 billion after just 16 months in business, the fastest company ever to reach this milestone.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "159_66742", "text": "Davison Design & Development, formerly Davison & Associates is a product development company.

The band released the albums Let's Do It Again, People Music, and Feel My Soul before signing to Event Records in 1974.In the mid-1970s, the band incorporated jazz elements and moved more towards a disco sound resulting in the singles, \"Keep On Steppin'\", \"Yum, Yum (Give Me Some)\", and \"(Are You Ready) Do the Bus Stop\". The singles proved popular in dance clubs, but did not do as well on the R&B chart until the spring of 1976 when \"(Do The) Spanish Hustle\" came close to the top ten.Now recording for Spring/Polydor, the group continued with the singles \"Party Time\", \"The Booty\", and \"Double Dutch\". Late 1977 brought a name change to Fatback, and in 1978 they found their first top ten single with \"I Like Girls\".

The company bought the right to the use of the Daimler name simultaneously from Gottlieb Daimler and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft of Cannstatt, Germany. After early financial difficulty and a reorganisation of the company in 1904, the Daimler Motor Company was purchased by Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) in 1910, which also made cars under its own name before the Second World War. In 1933, BSA bought the Lanchester Motor Company and made it a subsidiary of the Daimler Company.\nDaimler was awarded a Royal Warrant to provide cars to the British monarch in 1902; it lost this privilege in the 1950s after being supplanted by Rolls-Royce. Daimler occasionally used alternative technology: the Daimler-Knight engine which it further developed in the early twentieth century and used from 1909 to 1935, the worm gear final drive fitted from 1909 until after the Second World War, and their patented fluid flywheel used in conjunction with a Wilson preselector gearbox from 1930 to the mid-1950s.\nDaimler tried to widen its appeal in the 1950s with a line of smaller cars at one end and opulent show cars at the other, stopped making Lanchesters, had a highly publicised removal of their chairman from the board, and developed and sold a sports car and a high-performance luxury saloon and limousine. BSA sold Daimler to Jaguar Cars in 1960, and Jaguar briefly continued Daimler's line adding a Daimler variant of its Mark II sports saloon. Jaguar was then merged into the British Motor Corporation in 1966 and British Leyland in 1968. Under these companies, Daimler became an upscale trim level for Jaguar cars except for the 1968\u20131992 Daimler DS420 limousine, which had no Jaguar equivalent despite being fully Jaguar-based.

Fairings would vary throughout the country: at Bartholomew Fair in Smithfield, fairings of gingerbread were sold from 1126 to 1800; in the northern counties, a traditional fairing would be a decorated \"paste egg\" at Easter.  The Cornish version included the spiced ginger biscuit which became famous in Victorian times. The complete fairing from Cornwall would include the ginger biscuit, along with almond and caraway comfits (colloquially \"lambs' tails\" \u2013 actually sugar-coated almonds and caraway seeds), crystallised angelica and macaroons.During the 1800s, the biscuits became a treat that young men from the middle or lower classes would buy as a treat for their sweetheart. Previously, the spices required to create the biscuits were exclusive to the wealthy classes, who used them to make cakes. A number of manufacturers started making ginger biscuits called \"fairings\" all over England. One example of this was in Grasmere, where the gingerbread sold as fairings was so popular that William Wordsworth's sister Dorothy wrote in one of her journals that she and her brother both craved them. In 1875, John Cooper Furniss obtained a large store in East Bridge Street, Truro, and premises on Duchy Wharf and installed ovens for biscuit manufacturing. He introduced several new kinds of biscuits and also a penny box of sweetmeats with every box containing a small piece of jewellery. Needless to say, these were very successful and in great demand. In 1886, John Cooper Furniss started selling the ginger biscuits at his tea room in Truro, Cornwall, baking them in his Truro bakery. They were so popular that he started selling them via mail-order. The recipe Furniss used is thought to have originated from a \"maid-hiring\" fair which used to take place during the week after Christmas, in Launceston, Cornwall although Furniss Foods suggest the recipe came from the fairs held at Whitsuntide or Corpus Christi.Furniss went on to expand his company to Furniss Foods, a well-known Cornish biscuit manufacturer, which created a number of different fairing varieties, such as \"orange and lemon\" or \"apple and cinnamon\". He also established a Charitable Trust which is still in operation today. It is limited to the parish of Truro to provide assistance to residents in need who use coal as the primary source of heat. The company moved to a larger factory in 1988, but ran into financial difficulties during the 2000s and it was bought by Proper Cornish, a pasty manufacturer, which focused the company's production on the Cornish fairings and a couple of other lines.Cornish foods are an essential element in the county's touristic appeal, with a survey by South West tourism showing food as one of the top three reasons people visit Cornwall. During an interview where he was launching a new line of biscuits, celebrity chef Rick Stein explained that he associated fairings with his childhood.\n\n\"When I was a child, we never left Cornwall without a couple of tins of Furniss Cornish Fairings.

(formerly Apple Computer, Inc.) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley. It designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. Devices include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Vision Pro, and Apple TV; operating systems include iOS, iPadOS, and macOS; and software applications and services include iTunes, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\nFor most of 2011 to 2024, Apple became the world's largest company by market capitalization until Microsoft assumed the position in January 2024. In 2022, Apple was the largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.3 billion. As of 2023, Apple was the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales, the largest manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company's internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.\nIn 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs's return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\nApple has received criticism regarding its contractors' labor practices, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, it has a large following and a high level of brand loyalty. It has been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022.

However, in the process of writing his next full-length Control, he realized he had inadvertently created a narrative link \"about 70% of the way through [the album]\" and decided to finish it in the same vein.  The album's thematic content criticizes American capitalism, which Bazan notes was largely inspired by the sentiments surrounding the World Trade Organization protests in 1999.Control also saw Casey Foubert of Seattle-based Seldom join Pedro the Lion to play bass on the album. Additionally, Foubert co-wrote \"Penetration\" and \"Second Best\", the third and eighth tracks, respectively, on the album, which was released in 2002. Among other collaborations with music artists, Foubert has subsequently worked as a touring musician for singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens and the Portland-based indie rock band, The Shins.Achilles Heel followed, released on May 24, 2004, and marked the beginning of Bazan's partnership with TW Walsh as the band's primary writers and musicians.  Bazan described the tracks in the fourth full-length from Pedro the Lion as a return to the songwriting characterized by Friend and the Secure EP in the sense that there was no \"pretense of anything bigger\", an allusion to his previous concept albums.In early January 2006, Pedro the Lion formally announced that they had split. The split was amicable; Bazan and Walsh continue to be good friends. Bazan said that their friendship has even been strengthened by the breakup.  Bazan toured in support of Fewer Moving Parts, his solo debut EP. Walsh returned to his career as a Web application developer and is busy with his band, The Soft Drugs, and their debut release, In Moderation.  David Bazan released his debut solo LP, Curse Your Branches, on Seattle-based Barsuk Records in 2009.\nThe Pedro The Lion catalog was remastered for vinyl by TW Walsh and reissued in 2012.\nBazan is a member of Overseas with Will Johnson of  Centro-matic and Bubba & Matt Kadane of Bedhead and The New Year.

In October 2017, Bazan announced that Pedro the Lion would be reforming beginning with several shows in December 2017. Asked if there would be new material, Bazan explained that the band will initially be playing Pedro the Lion's existing catalog along with limited performances of songs from Headphones and Bazan's solo catalog, with new material to follow.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_7165", "text": "Pedro, a nickname for a fossil belonging to the extinct genus of penguins, Inkayacu.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Esopus lived in this area for thousands of years before being pushed out by the early pioneers.\nThe first building erected in what is now the center of the village was built around 1798 by Alpheus Fairchild, who moved west from Connecticut. However, in what is now the easternmost part of the village, the Bodley homestead most likely stood well before the Revolution, as did portions of the Bevier and Sax farms. It was named \"Fairchild City\" or just \"The City\" after Alpheus Fairchild, who bought most of today's village in 1798 from John A. DeWitt; Fairchild had a dwelling erected on part of the site where the George and John R. Hunt Memorial Building stands today. Nathan and Maria Hoornbeek bought the dwelling and enlarged it, converting it into an inn. The Hoornbeek Tavern was a gathering place for the citizens, and many important decisions about the community were made at meetings held there. Indeed, the decision to change the name of the community to \"Ellenville\" was proposed at the Hoornbeek Tavern. Village leaders, unable to agree upon a new name, were persuaded by Ellen Snyder, Maria Hoornbeek's sister, to name the village after her.\nCharles Hartshorn came to \"The City\" to try a case in the Hoornbeek Tavern in 1823. He opened the first store that same year, and led a drive to choose a \"real\" name for the community.  Hartshorn also applied to the federal government for approval of a post office and was named the first postmaster. He later erected a home for his family on the former site of the Hoornbeek Tavern. In 1856, he was elected first president of the newly incorporated village of Ellenville.\nNoted American composer Homer Newton Bartlett resided at 32 Maple Avenue in Ellenville for many years during the late 19th century.\nJust north of the village, the Joseph Y.

For their tight fusion of hardcore, punk, heavy metal, thrash, hip-hop and even reggae, Leeway are often credited as being one of the most influential and exploratory bands to emerge from the NYHC scene. Guitarist and songwriter A.J. Novello said of their career \"We might have helped open up a can of worms by bringing suburban metalheads to shows. Years later, it kind of ruined things in the scene, but I can't say I have any regrets.\" The fact that the band experimented with sound, had two guitarists riffing and solo-ing between them and the singer dressed in skeleton outfits and Yankees uniforms also set them out from the rest of the hardcore punk scene.\nLeeway subsequently signed to Profile Records, which released the band's first two albums, Born to Expire (1989) and Desperate Measures (1991); both albums were well received by fans and critics alike, and Leeway toured relentlessly in support of them.

In a 2014 interview with No Echo, guitarist Michael Gibbons recalled of the band's tenure with the label:\n\nThe label did no promotion. They also had no proper, accessible distribution of the album. Not to mention they didn't give us tour support and they had really low recording budgets. It was just a horrible record label, unless you were Run-D.M.C. or Rob Base.

Mater was born in 1940 and died in 2002 at the age of 62. The name Thixo-Tex was derived from the thixotropic properties of the rustproofing chemical that was applied to the cars. Thixotropic means a viscous fluid that will flow to self-heal small abrasions.   The reason for the change in the product name from Thixo-Tex to Rusty Jones was no one could remember the name \"Thixo-Tex\".

In 1961, Letraset came out with their dry transfer lettering system, which pioneered the technique.Starting in 1964, Letraset also applied the dry rub-down transfer technique to create a children's game called Action Transfers, which would later develop into Kalkitos (marketed by Gillette), and many other series of transferable figures that were very popular up to the 1980s. LETRASET was acquired by the Swedish stationery company Esselte until 2000, when it was sold to a Management buyout headed up by Martin Gibbs and Michael Travers. Eventually sold to ColArt in 2012. \nSeeing a decline in the sales of its materials in the early 1990s, Letraset moved into the desktop publishing industry, releasing software packages such as ImageStudio and ColorStudio for the Macintosh. These never saw widespread success. However, as Letraset held the rights to their fonts that had been popular on the dry transfer sheets, it made sense to enter the digital font market (see, for example, Charlotte Sans). Letraset thus began releasing many fonts in formats such as PostScript.\nFonts from designers including Martin Wait, Tim Donaldson, and David Quay were released, and many can be found on online retailers such as FontShop. Some fonts retain \"Letraset\" in their title, whereas others have been renamed by their new vendors, among them ITC.\nA selection of fonts is still sold from its website, separated into fonts from Fontek and Red Rooster. Software includes Manga Studio EX and Envelopes, a plug-in for Adobe Illustrator.\nLetraset is the maker of the refillable Tria markers, formerly Pantone Tria markers, which have a three-nib design and 200 colours. Additionally, Letraset offers three lines of dual-tipped markers, the alcohol-based ProMarker and FlexMarker lines, each with 148 mostly different colours and the water-based AquaMarkers with 60 colours.\nLetraset was based in Le Mans, France, having previously been based in Ashford, Kent, until being acquired in June 2012 by the Colart group and becoming part of its subsidiary Winsor & Newton.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "740_17250", "text": "In common usage, the name Letraset originally referred to sheets of transfer lettering that were originally manufactured as a wet process in 1959, with each character selected and cut from a sheet, placed face-down on a small silk screen frame and wetted with a paint brush to soften and release the gum arabic adhesive which held it. The frame was then turned over and the letter located over the artwork, and the character pressed into contact with the page, with the mounting base slid away as with model aircraft transfers.\nLater, in 1961, the process was simplified, and a dry transferable lettering system was developed. The range of available typefaces expanded, incorporating both classic and contemporary type designs of the period. Letraset sheets were used extensively by professional and amateur graphic designers, architects and artists in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. As a result of its relative affordability, and because of its ease of use, it also came to be used by printers, design studios and advertising agencies. In the late 1980s, Letraset started to be replaced by desktop publishing. Today, Letraset sheets are traded on eBay and elsewhere, and sometimes used so that a designer can avoid a digital look.\nThe name Letraset is also often used to refer generically to sheets of dry-transfer lettering of any brand. This technique was very widespread for lettering and other elements before the advent of the phototypesetting and laser computer techniques of word processing and desktop publishing.

In 2008, Wells Fargo acquired United Bancorporation of Wyoming and Century Bancshares of Texas.On October 3, 2008, after Wachovia turned down an inferior offer from Citigroup, Wachovia agreed to be bought by Wells Fargo for about $14.8 billion in stock. The next day, a New York state judge issued a temporary injunction blocking the transaction from going forward while the competing offer from Citigroup was sorted out. Citigroup alleged that it had an exclusivity agreement with Wachovia that barred Wachovia from negotiating with other potential buyers. The injunction was overturned late in the evening on October 5, 2008, by the New York state appeals court. Citigroup and Wells Fargo then entered into negotiations brokered by the FDIC to reach an amicable solution to the impasse. The negotiations failed. Citigroup was unwilling to take on more risk than the $42 billion that would have been the cap under the previous FDIC-backed deal (with the FDIC incurring all losses over $42 billion). Citigroup did not block the merger, but sought damages of $60 billion for breach of an alleged exclusivity agreement with Wachovia.On October 28, 2008, Wells Fargo received $25 billion of funds via the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act in the form of a preferred stock purchase by the United States Department of the Treasury.

At the height of its success and productivity, the company was a symbol of American manufacturing leadership in the world, and its decline and ultimate liquidation in the late 20th century is similarly cited as an example of America's diminished manufacturing leadership. From its founding in 1857 through its 2003 dissolution, Bethlehem Steel's headquarters and primary steel mill manufacturing facilities were based in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of the United States.\nThe company's steel was used in the construction of many of America's largest and most famed structures. Among major buildings, Bethlehem produced steel for 28 Liberty Street, the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Rockefeller Center, and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City and Merchandise Mart in Chicago. Among major bridges, Bethlehem steel was used in constructing the George Washington Bridge and Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in New York City, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, and the Peace Bridge between Buffalo and Fort Erie, Ontario.\nBethlehem Steel played an instrumental role in manufacturing the U.S. warships and other military weapons used in World War I and later by the Allied forces in ultimately winning World War II. Over 1,100 Bethlehem Steel-manufactured warships were built for use in defeating Nazi Germany and the Axis powers in World War II. Historians cite Bethlehem Steel's ability to quickly manufacture warships and other military equipment as decisive factors in American victories in both world wars.Bethlehem Steel's roots trace to an iron-making company organized in 1857 in Bethlehem, which was later named the Bethlehem Iron Company. In 1899, the owners of the iron company founded Bethlehem Steel Company and, five years later, Bethlehem Steel Corporation was created to be the steelmaking company's corporate parent.\nBethlehem Steel survived the earliest declines in the American steel industry beginning in the 1970s.

Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. At the time they barely knew the rudiments of instrumentation, and actually getting a band off the ground seemed unrealistic. Eventually, Hasula learned how to play a box guitar, later moving on to an electric guitar. In the meantime, schoolmate Dasith Fernando got a drum set and soon they were jamming, with Javeen on vocals. Another schoolmate, Soorya Hasthimuni, joined the band, and the four of them started to cover songs by their favourite bands. Soorya was on lead guitar and Hasula on rhythm guitar. Since they were lacking a bassist, they got another friend to help them on the bass guitar.At the beginning of 2004 the band decided take things more seriously and chose the name \"Tantrum\". They started off practising in cheap studios, since access to cash and good equipment was hard to come-by. The band put together a demo for TNL Onstage, although they were still short of a consistent bassist. Javeen took up bass guitar duties, but found it hard to play and sing at the same time. The band then got a new vocalist, who was also a schoolmate, who agreed to fill in until the band could identify a permanent vox. In the end, the band did not make it in to TNL Onstage 2004 due to the poor quality of the recording submitted as a demo as the band could not afford to record the track in a professional studio.This disappointing incident motivated the members to improve. Soon after, drummer Dasith left the band and other schoolmates filled in on various instruments for a short period, with Sujiv Fonseka and James Mather staying on as permanent drummer and lead guitarist respectively at the end of 2004. With these talented new members admitted to the Tantrum line-up, in the first few months of 2005 Tantrum had a stable line-up and decided to work on developing the original songs the band had composed over the past year. For once, they did not have to depend on many outside practice studio facilities as they practised at the drummer's home.Tantrum recorded and released their first single titled \"The Destroyer\", which instantly made waves in the local music scene with its unique theme, creative riffs and catchy drumming. It reached the number one spot on local TNL Radio's SL Hot 10, which it held for several weeks, and was the first debut track of any local band to reach the Number 1 spot on this much listened to chart-show that highlighted the best of local talent each week.\nThis earned Tantrum some recognition in the music scene. They joined the now defunct Rock Company, which was then the main organisation promoting rock and metal bands in Sri Lanka. Soon afterwards, Tantrum released their second single, titled \"Alone,\"  which although wholly different from The Destroyer in terms of mood and composition, also became a chart topping hit within a few weeks of its debut, and a new favourite among the local rock fans. Tantrum entered TNL Onstage 2005, and won the trophy for the Best Band. This was a good achievement as the band had been unable to even qualify for the competition the previous year. After Onstage and the release of the track \"Alone,\" drummer Sujiv left the band as he was leaving the country. He was replaced by former Hi-Octane drummer Heshan Jayawardena. Soon after Tantrum's first Rock Saturday event, which was also in 2005, Hasula left the band as he was leaving the country. The band that had a unique presence with three guitarists was now down to two, and has remained a four-member line-up ever since.The band also later saw the exit of guitarists Soorya and James who both left the country and were replaced by Malinda Senanayake and Arjun Dhas. Malinda later left the band and was replaced by Thishan Wijesinghe, while Arjun was replaced by Akila Peiris. Drummer Heshan Jayawardena left the band in 2006, and was replaced by Oshada Wijemanne who played with the band until 2008, when he left the country and was replaced by Tharaka Seneviratne, formerly of Whirlwind and Stigmata.\nThe band released an EP titled The Destruction Begins in 2006. They have performed at several large and small musical events across Sri Lanka, having also headlined Heavy Metal festivals in India and the Maldives, with some members having played in Australia with associated acts.\nTantrum released their debut album \"Rebellion\" in 2012, setting a new standard in the quality of heavy metal recordings in Sri Lanka.\nOn February 14, 2015, Tantrum released a statement announcing that Taraka Senewirathne would step down from drumming duties.

During the Depression, Dominion lost both founders: Jackson went bankrupt and Pentland was killed in an auto accident in 1933.Dominion's leadership was not resolved until 1939, when J. William Horsey became president. He in turn sold Dominion Stores to Argus Corporation. Smaller stores were consolidated from 574 to 195 by 1954.

Her birthplace is about five miles (8 km) east of North Star. There is a stone-mounted plaque in the vicinity of the site, which was placed by the Annie Oakley Committee in 1981, 121 years after her birth.\nAnnie's parents were Quakers of English descent from Hollidaysburg, Blair County, Pennsylvania: Susan Wise, born 1830, and Jacob Mosey, born 1799, married in 1848. They moved to a rented farm (later purchased with a mortgage) in Patterson Township, Darke County, Ohio, sometime around 1855.\nBorn in 1860, Annie was the sixth of Jacob and Susan's nine children, and the fifth of the seven surviving. Her siblings were Mary Jane (1851\u20131867), Lydia (1852\u20131882), Elizabeth (1855\u20131881), Sarah Ellen (1857\u20131939), Catherine (1859\u20131859), John (1861\u20131949), Hulda (1864\u20131934) and a stillborn infant brother in 1865. Annie's father, who had fought in the War of 1812, was 61 years old at the time of Annie's birth and became an invalid from hypothermia during a blizzard in late 1865 and died of pneumonia in early 1866 at age 66. Her mother later married Daniel Brumbaugh, had another daughter, Emily (1868\u20131937), and was widowed once again.\nBecause of poverty following her father's death, Annie did not regularly attend school as a child, although she did attend later in childhood and in adulthood. On March 15, 1870, at age nine, she was admitted to the Darke County Infirmary along with her sister Sarah Ellen. According to her autobiography, she was put in the care of the infirmary's superintendent, Samuel Crawford Edington, and his wife Nancy, who taught her to sew and decorate. Beginning in the spring of 1870, she was \"bound out\" to a local family to help care for their infant son, on the false promise of fifty cents per week (equivalent to $12 in 2023) and an education. The couple had originally wanted someone who could pump water and cook and who was bigger. She spent about two years in near slavery to them, enduring mental and physical abuse. One time, the wife put Annie out in the freezing cold without shoes, as a punishment because she had fallen asleep over some darning. Annie referred to them as \"the wolves\". Even in her autobiography, she never revealed the couple's real names.According to biographer Glenda Riley, \"the wolves\" could have been the Studabaker family, but the 1870 U.S. Census suggests they were the Abram Boose family of neighboring Preble County. Around the spring of 1872, Annie ran away from \"the wolves\". According to biographer Shirl Kasper, it was only at this point that Annie met and lived with the Edingtons, returning to her mother's home around the age of 15.Annie began trapping before age 7, and shooting and hunting by age 8, to support her siblings and her widowed mother. She sold hunted game to locals in Greenville, such as shopkeepers Charles and G. Anthony Katzenberger, who shipped it to hotels in Cincinnati and other cities. She also sold the game to restaurants and hotels in northern Ohio. Her skill paid off the mortgage on her mother's farm when Annie was 15.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The factory was originally set up in 1997 by a Chinese tobacco company and was then briefly owned by the First Automobile Works (FAW Jiefang) before the SAIC group took over the factory. Since 2000, a number of Austin Maestro/Montego amalgams had been produced under the Etsong Lubao and Etsong Lande nameplates, but SGMW did not recommence production of these aged models after the takeover. Instead, the factory is used to augment SGMW mini-vehicle capacity.\nBaojun\nPerhaps the culmination of GM's dream to build a \"farmer's car\", the Baojun brand was established in 2010 and aims to sell to consumers in third and fourth tier Chinese cities. Such large- and medium-sized Chinese cities are not counted among the top four in terms of population and contribution to GDP.Baojun currently competes for consumers with indigenous brands like Chery and Geely.

In Final Fantasy VII, Cloud is a mercenary who wields a large broadsword and claims to have formerly been part of SOLDIER, a group of elite supersoldiers employed by the Shinra Electric Power Company, a megacorporation responsible for draining life from the planet. He later defected from SOLDIER after becoming disillusioned with Shinra, and in an attempt to get paid, he joins the resistance group AVALANCHE in the fight against Shinra and his former superior, the primary antagonist Sephiroth, who aims to annihilate the world. Over the course of the story, it is eventually revealed that Cloud is a mentally-scarred individual who adopted the skill and personality of an actual SOLDIER, the deceased Zack Fair, and is actually little more than a Shinra foot soldier, but learns to accept his troubled past and his own identity in order to defeat Sephiroth and save the world.\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 computer-animated sequel film, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, in which he fights a new threat composed of a trio attacking his allies while also dealing with a terminal illness called \"Geostigma\".

Yoshinori Kitase, director of VII, and Kazushige Nojima, one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After VII, Nomura redesigned Cloud for Advent Children, giving him a more realistic appearance alongside new weaponry and a new outfit.

They also did several short tours during this period, playing in New York, at CBGB and Hurrah, in '78 and '79.Describing a July 1979 performance, music critic Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times focused on \"Tomata's extraordinary power on stage.\" According to Hilburn, \"Tomata's hair was greased to stand straight up, giving him the look of a man who had just stuck his finger into an electric socket. His performance reflected the nervous, relentless anxiety of someone whose troubles are even deeper... by the end of the 40-minute set, du Plenty has gone through the same disintegration of the human will that we associate with such books as \"1984.\" Eventually, the tuxedo jacket, shirt and tie are ripped off, leaving him symbolically naked in his attempt to maintain some dignity and individuality. As if suddenly put in another man's body, he asks in horror: \"Who am I?\" The Screamers never released a single official recording of any kind, although several bootleg recordings have since appeared, composed of rehearsals or live tapes. At one point, the group determined they would release their debut album only in video form (a highly unusual approach before MTV existed or VCRs were common), and they devoted time and resources to constructing a small movie studio. Despite some fitful efforts in the early 1980s, the band had effectively dissolved before their video plans were realized. Roessler joined L.A.'s other \"synthpunk\" band, Nervous Gender. The other band members pursued non-musical careers, though K.K. Barrett reunited with Roessler to perform several Screamers songs live in late 2000, in tribute to Tomata du Plenty, who had recently died in San Francisco in August 2000.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "740_17615", "text": "The Scream (Acetate) 1979 - (For the Rodney on the ROQ radio show, only 2 known copies).\nLive In San Francisco (VHS) - Target Video of a September 2, 1978 live concert at the Mabuhay Gardens.\nScreamers Demo Hollywood 1977 (EP) - Released by Superior Viaduct 2021", "hasanswer": false}]}

The root beer was so successful, that his business grew, and grew, and grew!\"Several years later, Zatarain found that it was more cost effective to sell the root beer blend as an extract. Zatarain formed a company called Papoose Pure Food Products to manufacture the root beer and diversify into other foods and he built a factory at 925 Valmont Street, New Orleans.  He began to import and pack olives, pickles and spices.When the root beer and spice business became more profitable than the grocery store, Zatarain focused on the manufacturing business at Papoose Pure Food Products. His root beer extract sold in barrels to restaurants and markets where it was added to carbonated water.\nSeasonings with a Creole or Cajun flair were among the first of Papoose Pure's products expansions. Next they moved into Creole Mustard and pickled products.On May 29, 1922, as his sons assumed more of the day-to-day operation, Zatarain reincorporated the business as E.A. Zatarain & Sons, Inc. and also did business as Zatarain's Pure Food Products. Emile A. Zatarain, Jr. and his wife Ida May Bennett Zatarain eventually took over the business. Ida May created recipes for their products, like Remoulade Sauce and Olive Salad.In 1963 the family sold the business to James Grinstead Viavant, founder of the Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans, who had sold his ship building business in 1959. Viavant took over the company, which was using outdated packaging technology, and modernized it.\nIn 1963, Viavant merged Zatarain's Papoose Products Co., Inc. and another recently-acquired business, Pelican State Lab, owner of a brand of coated fish frying seasoning mix called Fish-Fri, which was brought under the Zatarain's label, and became a best-seller. He dropped bleach, dyes, and pickles and focused on the profit centers at a new plant with modern equipment on a five-acre campus in Gretna, Louisiana, where he turned Zatarain's into a regionally well-known brand by the early 1970s. Fish-Fri became \"the entre\u00e8\" of litigation in 1983. Zatarain's sued Oak Grove Smokehouse for trademark infringement; Oak Grove sold a competitor \"Fish Fry.\" Although the court determined Fish-Fri qualified for protection, Oak Grove's Fish Fry qualified as a fair use. The case opinion is also notable for its use of puns.With sales now at $10M a year, as Viavant neared retirement, he sold the business to Centra Soya Co. for $24 million in May 1984. Centra increased sales revenues to $14M when it sold Zatarain's to a San Francisco holding company, Wyndham Foods, Inc., 18 months later. Wyndham kept the retail business and expanded the brand into the institutional food business. They rolled out the boxed food products that Zatarains still manufactures, using the term \"Cajun\" on the boxes to capitalize on the trend in cooking popularized by New Orleans chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s. When the fad faded, the company shifted to branding Zatarain's products as \"Louisiana-style\" or \"New Orleans-style\".The company was acquired again in 1987 by a Brentwood, Tennessee company, Martha White Foods, itself a subsidiary of E-II Food Specialties Co., for $35 million. Zatarain's had several more owners over a period of months in the late 1980s, including American Brands of Old Greenwich, Connecticut.\nBy the 1990s, Zatarain's marketed more than 200 products locally and regionally.  It pushed for a national footing with the first national television advertising in 1999.\nThe company was taken private in a leveraged buyout by Citigroup Venture Capital in 1993 as Zatarain's Partnership LP, a partner group of Citigroup Venture Capital and several Zatarain's employees. The product line was expanded to include frozen foods.  It was sold to McCormick on May 9, 1993 for $180M after the company's sales rose 15% annually for the prior five years.In 2017, the New Orleans Pelicans announced Zatarain's as their jersey patch sponsor.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "176_57591", "text": "The Nissan Pintara is a compact automobile that was manufactured by Nissan Motor Australia from 1986 until 1992.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Shortly thereafter Intronaut toured Europe for the first time in support of The Ocean.\nIn January 2008, the band announced that they had signed a worldwide deal with Century Media Records and completed their next album, Prehistoricisms.  As the album was the first without del Muerte - whom the band described as their \"metal riff guy\" - Prehistoricisms took on a more rhythmic quality that was exemplified by the double-drummer ending of \"Any Port\".

The guitar work is based around distorted and sometimes fuzzed tones. Guitar parts include anything from driving head-banging riffs to dissonant ones. Various metal genres are represented in Intronaut's songs. These genres include heavy metal, stoner metal, post-metal, and sludge metal. Bass guitar is a prominent feature of Intronaut's sound,  often serving as the primary melodic component of certain riffs. The use of fretless bass guitars on numerous songs adds to the prominence of bass guitar in Intronaut's songs and reflects the influence of jazz, a genre in which fretless bass guitar is common, on the band's sound. Intronaut's songs frequently shift between intense metal sections and jazz-inspired ambient sections. These jazz-inspired passages employ jazz chord shapes and tones with heavy reverb to create ethereal breaks from their more intense riffs. Vocal tones include screaming, growling, and melodic singing, often featuring elaborate harmonies. The drum performances focuses heavily on polymeters and polyrhythms, typical of the jazz, progressive, and various metal genres that influence Intronaut's sound. Intronaut often incorporate more experimental, psychedelic passages into their songs as well, utilizing unique instruments such as sitars and hand percussion.\nIntronaut have frequently been compared to other progressive oriented sludge metal acts such as Mastodon and Baroness, though the band members have denied that the latter was ever a significant influence on their sound. A marked stylistic change came when clean vocals were introduced on their album Valley of Smoke. Intronaut's clean vocals, consisting largely of harmonisations between guitarist/vocalists Dunable and Timnick, has frequently been compared to Alice in Chains. Habitual Levitations used clean vocals almost exclusively and was also largely devoid of the band's earlier extreme metal influences, drawing comparisons to acts such as Deftones, Hum, Oceansize, Tool, and Alice in Chains. The release of the album The Direction of Last Things marked the return of more aggressive vocal styles and other extreme metal elements, while retaining the more melodic sensibilities of their previous two albums.

In 1848, the pair entered the booming market for selling inexpensive imprints of works of fiction to rail travellers, in the style of the German Tauchnitz family, which became known as the \"Railway Library\".The venture was a success as railway usage grew, and it eventually led to Routledge, along with W H Warne's brother Frederick Warne, to found the company, George Routledge & Co. in 1851.\nThe following year in 1852, the company gained lucrative business through selling reprints of Uncle Tom's Cabin, (in the public domain in the UK) which in turn enabled it to pay author Edward Bulwer-Lytton \u00a320,000 for a 10-year lease allowing sole rights to print all 35 of his works including 19 of his novels to be sold cheaply as part of their \"Railway Library\" series.\nThe company was restyled in 1858 as Routledge, Warne & Routledge when George Routledge's son, Robert Warne Routledge, entered the partnership. Frederick Warne eventually left the company after the death of his brother W. H. Warne in May 1859 (died aged 37). Gaining rights to some titles, he founded Frederick Warne & Co. in 1865, which became known for its Beatrix Potter books. In July 1865, George Routledge's son Edmund Routledge became a partner, and the firm became George Routledge & Sons.By 1899, the company was running close to bankruptcy. Following a successful restructuring in 1902 by scientist Sir William Crookes, banker Arthur Ellis Franklin, William Swan Sonnenschein as managing director, and others, however, it was able to recover and began to acquire and merge with other publishing companies including J. C. Nimmo Ltd. in 1903. In 1912, the company took over the management of Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner & Co., the descendant of companies founded by Charles Kegan Paul, Alexander Chenevix Trench, Nicholas Tr\u00fcbner, and George Redway.These early 20th-century acquisitions brought with them lists of notable scholarly titles, and from 1912 onward,  the company became increasingly concentrated in the academic and scholarly publishing business under the imprint \"Kegan Paul Trench Trubner\", as well as reference, fiction and mysticism. In 1947, George Routledge and Sons finally merged with Kegan Paul Trench Trubner (the umlaut had been quietly dropped in the First World War) under the name of Routledge & Kegan Paul. Using C. K. Ogden and later Karl Mannheim as advisers the company was soon particularly known for its titles in philosophy, psychology and the social sciences.\nIn 1985, Routledge & Kegan Paul joined with Associated Book Publishers (ABP), which was later acquired by International Thomson in 1987. Under Thomson's ownership, Routledge's name and operations were retained, with the additions of backlists from Methuen, Tavistock Publications, Croom Helm and Unwin Hyman. In 1996, a management buyout financed by the European private equity firm Cinven saw Routledge operating as an independent company once again. In 1997, Cinven acquired journals publisher Carfax and book publisher Spon. In 1998, Cinven and Routledge's directors accepted a deal for Routledge's acquisition by Taylor & Francis Group (T&F), with the Routledge name being retained as an imprint and subdivision.In 2004, T&F became a division within Informa plc after a merger.

Upon being discharged from the military, Gentry worked for Honeywell as a sales engineer.On a flight from Los Angeles to New York City, Gentry met business manager and philanthropist Harry Gray. Four months later, Gray called Gentry and offered him a job with Litton Industries. During his stay at Litton Industries, Gentry established a plant of the company in Springfield, Missouri. However, feeling that he needed to explore other opportunities, he decided to create his own small company. By October 1966, he had founded Positronic Industries in Springfield, Missouri and initially, the company manufactured electronic components and connectors for the aerospace industry.Eight years later, Positronic moved to Rogersville, Missouri, and in the following years, it progressed and managed three expansions. Tragically, the company's growth was shaken in February 1983, when a fire destroyed its new headquarters and manufacturing plant. Fearing that the company's competitors would take advantage of the situation, Gentry and his employees worked tirelessly to rebuild Positronic. They moved the company back to Springfield, Missouri, where Positronic's headquarters is still located today. And as the company gradually recovered from its losses, Positronic decided to venture overseas. Just months after the fire, the company expanded its operations into Europe. This expansion continued into Puerto Rico in 1991, Singapore in 1995, and India in 2004.Beginning in 1993, Positronic began offering on-the-job training as a part of its apprenticeship program. The program is geared toward high school students seeking jobs in high-tech manufacturing, and it is offered to 17 and 18-year-olds as a school-to-work career opportunity. After graduation, successful apprentices are offered both employment with Positronic and funding for their college education for two years. Positronic also used the Ozarks Technical Community College training program for its own employee co-operative program.In March 1995, employees of the main plant in Springfield were sent home after a chemical accident released a chlorine odor throughout the facility. A treatment plant operator caused the accident by improperly mixing chemicals in a waste treatment holding tank, creating pockets of chlorine gas. No one was harmed in the incident.Despite the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, Positronic opened its 43,000 ft2 assembly plant in Mount Vernon, Missouri in 1999. Although the company had established a presence in Mount Vernon years before on July 5, 1988, the opening of the new facility was a part of Positronic's expansion into the Mount Vernon area. The facility houses the company's plastic molding department.In 2002, less than a year after the September 11 attacks, then-US Senatorial candidate Jim Talent of Missouri visited Springfield. Talent put forward the message that the US government had to increase its military spending, especially in regard to building a strong missile defense system. On his tour of Positronic's facility on North Eldon Avenue, Talent stated that increasing the government's defense spending would produce more jobs for the American people. Positronic, a creator of domestic manufacturing jobs, produces electronic products that are being used in satellites, missiles, and other military equipment.In 2011, Positronic moved eighty-one jobs from the two Springfield manufacturing plants to its Mount Vernon manufacturing plant. The shift was made in order to double the workforce of the Mount Vernon plant and to consolidate the company's two electrical connector assembly lines. With the increase in workforce, the company became one of the largest private employers in Mount Vernon.In the same year, the company provided two $15,000 gift funds to Ozarks Technical Community College. The funds supported the expansion of the Information Commons West on the Springfield campus and financed the Middle College program. A new classroom in the Information Commons West was named in honor of Positronic.In March 2013, Positronic launched its new online commerce website, PosiShop.

Matchless was the trading name of Collier & Sons, the father Henry Herbert Collier and his sons Charlie and Harry. The Matchless tank badge was a winged \"M\". Like many motorcycle manufacturers of the time, they had started as bicycle manufacturers. They produced a JAP V-twin powered bike in 1905, with one of the earliest swing-arm rear suspensions, coupled with leading-link front forks. Charlie won the inaugural TT singles race in 1907 at an average speed of 38.21 mph in a time of 4 hours 8 minutes 8 seconds. Harry did not finish in 1907, but won in 1909, and Charlie won again in 1910, bringing Matchless motorcycles to the attention of the public. Matchless made mostly singles, but they also made V-twins from 496 cc to 998 cc. They made their own engines from 1912 on. \n\nAt the 1912 Olympia Motor Cycle and Cycle Car show Matchless showed a V-twin powered cycle car, with two wheels at the front and a single drive wheel at the rear. Unusually the drive was by shaft and bevel gear. The frame was of pressed steel channel. It was priced at 100 guineas.\nMatchless was not given a contract to make motorcycles for the army during the First World War. Peacetime production resumed in 1919, concentrating at first on V-twins for sidecar use, leaving singles until 1923. In 1926 Henry Collier died, and by 1928 Matchless was a limited company. In 1930 they launched a narrow-angle 400 cc V-twin called the Silver Arrow, designed by Charlie. The Silver Arrow, launched in 1929, was a side-valve v-twin with 54 x 86mm dimensions and 394 cc. The two cylinders were set at 18 degrees within a single casting under a single head. The result looked odd, rather like a single that was too long, and with the exhaust emerging from the manifold at its right corner and the carburettor in the middle of the block on the left, the odd appearance was accentuated, and in 1930 they launched an (advanced for the time) 593 cc OHC V-four, the Silver Hawk. About 60 out of the 500 made survive, The Hawk was designed by youngest brother Bert, who was now active in the company, and he was responsible for design right up to the war.\nIn 1931 Matchless bought AJS from the Stevens brothers. Matchless bought Sunbeam in the late thirties, but Sunbeam was sold to BSA in 1943.\nAfter that the only \"true\" AJS models, as far as AJS enthusiasts were concerned, were the racing 7Rs, Porcupines and the pre-war AJS Four. The shared models were considered by some AJS fans to be only badge-engineered Matchless models. In 1935 the Matchless/AJS hairpin valve springs made their first appearance. Matchless supplied engines for the V-twin versions of the Morgan three-wheeler from 1933 until Morgan production was halted by the outbreak of World War II in 1939. From 1935 on they were Morgan's exclusive supplier of V-twin engines. A dozen surviving unused engines were still in storage at the Morgan works in 1946 and were used to build a final batch of V-Twin trikes for a Morgan dealer in Australia. Matchless also supplied engines after 1935 to 1940 to the Brough Superior works.

He was the son of Frank Day-Lewis, a Church of Ireland rector of that parish, and Kathleen Blake (n\u00e9e Squires; died 1906). Some of his family were from England and the family had originally been from Berkhamstead, in Hertfordshire, and settled in Ireland in the late 1860s. His father took the surname \"Day-Lewis\" as a combination of his own birth father's (\"Day\") and adoptive father's (\"Lewis\") surnames. \nIn his autobiography The Buried Day (1960), Day-Lewis wrote: \"As a writer I do not use the hyphen in my surname \u2013 a piece of inverted snobbery which has produced rather mixed results.\"\n\nAfter the death of his mother in 1906, when he was two years old, Cecil was brought up in London by his father, with the help of an aunt, spending summer holidays with relatives in County Wexford. He was educated at Sherborne School and at Wadham College, Oxford. In Oxford, Day-Lewis became part of the circle gathered around W. H. Auden and helped him to edit Oxford Poetry 1927. His first collection of poems, Beechen Vigil, appeared in 1925.In 1928, Day-Lewis married Constance Mary King, the daughter of a Sherborne teacher. Day-Lewis worked as a schoolmaster in three schools, including Larchfield School, Helensburgh, Scotland (now Lomond School). During the 1940s, he had a long and troubled love affair with the novelist Rosamond Lehmann, to whom he dedicated his 1943 poetry collection Word Over All. His first marriage was dissolved in 1951, and he married actress Jill Balcon, daughter of Michael Balcon. Day-Lewis met Jill at the recording of a radio programme in 1948 and began a relationship with her that year, despite being married to Mary. He continued simultaneous relationships with his married wife Mary who lived with their two sons in Dorset, unmarried mistress Lehmann who lived in Oxfordshire, and Jill who was his latest love. Day-Lewis eventually broke with both his wife and his mistress in order to be with Jill. But he was no more faithful to Jill than he had been with Mary or Rosamond. Jill's father was deeply unhappy about the scandalous affair since Jill was named publicly as co-respondent in Day-Lewis' divorce. He disinherited Jill and cut off all relationships with her and Day-Lewis.During the Second World War, he worked as a publications editor in the Ministry of Information, an institution satirised by George Orwell in his dystopian Nineteen Eighty-Four, but equally based on Orwell's experience of the BBC. During the Second World War, his work was less influenced by Auden and he was developing a more traditional style of lyricism. Some critics believe that he reached his full stature as a poet in Word Over All (1943), when he finally distanced himself from Auden. After the war, he joined the publisher Chatto & Windus as a director and senior editor.\nIn 1946, Day-Lewis was a lecturer at Cambridge University, publishing his lectures in The Poetic Image (1947). Day-Lewis became a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the 1950 Birthday Honours. He later taught poetry at Oxford, where he was Professor of Poetry from 1951 to 1956. During 1962\u20131963, he was the Norton Professor at Harvard University. Day-Lewis was appointed Poet Laureate in 1968, in succession to John Masefield. His appointment came after appointments secretary John Hewitt consulted with Dame Helen Gardner, the Merton Professor of English at the University of Oxford (who stated that Day-Lewis \"produced run of the mill poetry but nothing particularly outstanding\") and Geoffrey Handley-Taylor, chair of the Poetry Society (who stated that Day-Lewis was \"a good administrative poet\" and \"a safe bet\").Day-Lewis was chairman of the Arts Council Literature Panel, vice-president of the Royal Society of Literature, an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Member of the Irish Academy of Letters and a Professor of Rhetoric at Gresham College, London.\n\nCecil Day-Lewis died from pancreatic cancer on 22 May 1972, aged 68, at Lemmons, the Hertfordshire home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard, where he and his family were staying. As a great admirer of Thomas Hardy, he arranged to be buried near the author's grave at St Michael's Church in Stinsford, Dorset.Day-Lewis was the father of four children. His first two children, with Constance Mary King, were Sean Day-Lewis (3 August 1931\u20139 June 2022), a TV critic and writer, and Nicholas Day-Lewis, who became an engineer. His children with Balcon were Tamasin Day-Lewis, a television chef and food critic, and Daniel Day-Lewis, who became an award-winning actor. Sean Day-Lewis wrote a biography of his father, C.

The founding members (guitarist Howard Gould, husband of Court TV anchor Ashleigh Banfield, drummer Mike Johnson, lead guitarist Johnny Myers, bassist Cain Goettleman, and singer Jack Lewin) left the band upon graduating in 1990 and 1991, leaving it in the hands of the three current members. In the early days the band saw members come and go including singer Sally Taylor, the daughter of Carly Simon and James Taylor. All three current members were students and eventual graduates of Tabor Academy.  After attending the Berklee School of Music in Boston for a short time, the trio collectively dropped out in 1996 to push their debut self-released album, From the Gecko.\nFollowing consistent touring, mostly in the Northeast but eventually in the West as well, the band was signed to Butch Trucks's label Flying Frog Records, where they put out Does in 2000. Subsequent years saw continued touring, including their first trip to Japan, and the release of the band's first live album, Live Is My Jumby. The Slip then signed to Rykodisc, releasing Angels Come on Time in 2002.\nIn 2003, the companion live albums Alivelectric and Aliveacoustic were released on the band's own label, 216 Records. The former was a mostly instrumental exploration into experimental noise collages, reminiscent at times of post-rock bands such as Do Make Say Think and Tortoise, or electronic acts like Squarepusher. The latter consisted of Americana-tinged folk songs with an emphasis on lyrics, though some songs such as \"Torque\" and \"Song\" were more reminiscent of earlier, jazz-influenced Slip work.\nStarting in 2004, the band began to focus less energy on touring as The Slip and more on the Surprise Me Mr. Davis side project and the new Slip studio album. In 2005, the song \"Even Rats\", an early cut from the newest studio sessions, was featured on the PlayStation 2 video game Guitar Hero. The song was also released as a single available only online in 2006. Justin Vernon, of Bon Iver, was influenced by the group.During 2005 and 2006, The Slip gained greater recognition after appearances at festivals such as Bonnaroo, SXSW, Bumbershoot, and High Sierra Music Festival. After a long period of record label shopping, \"Even Rats\" and other songs finally saw release on the album Eisenhower, released in November 2006 on Bar/None Records. Eisenhower saw an evolution in their sound, incorporating indie rock influences from bands like Built to Spill and The Flaming Lips. The Slip supported the album by touring throughout the United States and Canada, including a run of dates opening for the indie rock band My Morning Jacket in November and December 2006. The album also placed an emphasis on songwriting over improvisation. On February 5, 2007, the Slip made their national television debut on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, playing \"Children of December\". The following June, they performed at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee for the second time. \nStarting in late 2007, the trio took an unannounced hiatus from regular touring and have since only played occasional gigs as The Slip. The members have been pursuing musical endeavors outside of the band. In 2008 The Slip supported Sonya Kitchell in a tour for her album This Storm. The album is a collaboration between Kitchell, Brad Barr, Andrew Barr, and Malcolm Burn.Brad, Andrew and Marc have continued to play with Nathan Moore and Marco Benevento in the band Surprise Me Mr. Davis. After moving to Montreal in 2005, Brad and Andrew pursued solo projects culminating in The Barr Brothers, also featuring Sarah Page on Harp and multi-instrumentalist Andres Vial. Marc Friedman has performed as a member of Marco Benevento's trio as well as collaborating with San Francisco-based Big Light, producing their upcoming album and subbing for bassist Steve Adams for many gigs.In 2009, The Slip played a short East Coast Summer tour and returned to High Sierra Music Festival in Quincy, California, on July 4 and 5. 2010 saw only a handful of shows in New York, Austin & San Francisco as well as their 13th consecutive year at High Sierra Music Festival, a higher total than any other band in the history of the festival. February 2011 brought the return of The Slip to Japan as well as dates at the Brooklyn Bowl in Williamsburg, New York on July 14, 2011 and The Met in Pawtucket, RI on July 16, 2011. 2012 was rung in with two shows at San Francisco's Cafe Du Nord on December 30 & 31, 2011.The future of The Slip seems to be on hold as the founding members, Brad and Andrew, had been focusing their work into The Barr Brothers as of late. The Slip has reportedly been working on recording a follow-up album to Eisenhower since 2009 and have introduced several new songs as cuts from the supposed album in their latest live performances. Bassist Marc Friedman still resides in California, supposedly working on new material as he explores various musical endeavours. 2013 marked the first in 15 years the group had been absent from the lineup of High Sierra Music Festival. They were absent from the festival lineup in 2014 as well, still focusing more energy into other musical endeavours. In early 2015, The Slip announced a return to the festival for the 2015 lineup. This would be the band's first performance since 2011.\nIn 2021 the band reunited for three sets at LOCKN' Farm as part of Joe Russo's Almost Dead's curated festival in mid-August. Soon after, The Slip announced their first proper tour since 2009. The seven-show-run included stops in Burlington, Providence, Boston, Philly, Brooklyn, and finished up at Levon Helm's barn in Woodstock, New York. The shows saw the trio revisit early material, re-work fan favourites, and debut new songs.

James claims that the formation of Hacktivist was a \"fluke\", with no intention of developing such a style, but the group was born when peer J Hurley, a local rapper with little history in the metal scene, began recording vocals over some of James' demos. After the demos became very popular online, James decided to recruit a full lineup, bringing in Richard Hawking on drums, Josh Gurner (ex-Sacred Mother Tongue) on bass and Ben Marvin (James's former bandmate in Heart of a Coward) as a second vocalist. In 2012, the band put out a self-titled EP resulting in debut single \"Unlike Us\" reaching No. 2 on the Amazon UK metal chart within 48 hours.

This included supporting slots for acts such as Enter Shikari and Korn and performances in European festivals such as Sonisphere Festival, Download Festival and Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in summer 2013.

The agency pioneered the collection and dissemination of news as a commodity, and had established itself as a fully global concern by the late 19th century. Two Havas employees, Paul Julius Reuter and Bernhard Wolff, set up their own news agencies in London and Berlin respectively.In 1940, when German forces occupied France during World War II, the news agency was taken over by the authorities and renamed \"Office fran\u00e7ais d'information\" (French Information Office); only the private advertising company retained the name Havas. On 20 August 1944, as Allied forces moved on Paris, a group of journalists in the French Resistance seized the offices of the FIO and issued the first news dispatch from the liberated city under the name of Agence France-Presse.\nEstablished as a state enterprise, AFP devoted the post-war years to developing its network of international correspondents. One of them was the first Western journalist to report the death of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin on 6 March 1953.\nAFP was keen to shake off its semi-official status, and on 10 January 1957, the French Parliament passed a law establishing its independence. Since that date, the proportion of the agency's revenues generated by subscriptions from government departments has steadily declined. Such subscriptions represented 115 million euros in 2011.In 1982, the agency began to decentralize its editorial decision-making by setting up the first of its five autonomous regional centres, in Hong Kong, then a British dependent territory.

Only one disc had been recorded at that time: a four-song demo containing \"No One's Gonna Do It for You\", \"Hard to Be Vain\", \"Heartbreak Suicide\", and \"A.S.A.D.\" Heartbreak Suicide ended up becoming the band's most popular song.\nVains of Jenna captured the attention of Stevie Rachelle (Tuff singer, and the owner of hard rock website Metal Sludge) during their first ever performance in America, playing at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood during the charity event Cr\u00fce Fest Hollywood. Rachelle offered the band a demo deal and a manager's contract 48 hours later. Rachelle booked the band to record at Redrum Studios with his friend former Guns N' Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke producing. The band had only been in Los Angeles for one week when all this took place.After spending the winter in Sweden, they toured the United Kingdom in the spring of 2006. The band lived in guitarist Nicki's Volvo station wagon for a month between playing gigs around London and surrounding cities. In May, the group relocated to California. The band toured coast to coast, and in many cases were not old enough to play bars they were booked in, which had a minimum age of 21. This would sometimes leave half the band in the van outside, only to be let in to load up on stage, play, and then leave at the end of their set. One of these such tours was when Rachelle flew the band to the East Coast in the summer of 2006, where they played 1st slot in support of UK band Teenage Casket Company and The Erotics from New York. During the American East Coast tour in July 2006, the run was cut short, as Bam Margera of the show Jackass had recently signed the band to his Filthy Note Records label. Margera invited the band to his mansion to shoot a video for the song \"No One's Gonna Do It for You\", which Margera produced himself, and used \"Don't Give a Damn\" as the theme song to his upcoming MTV series Bam's Unholy Union. The band was featured in two episodes of the show.\nArticles in Spin, Metal Edge, Revolver, Blender, Hustler, and other international print magazines followed. They found themselves on TV shows such as Jackass Number Two on MTV, and LA Ink, featuring good friend and fan of the band Kat Von D.

Rachelle pushed Dall to add the young band to the tour. After months of calls, the band was initially added to the side stage on several of the Live Nation produced events. As the tour grew closer, White Lion encountered some legal troubles and had to pull out. Since White Lion had to drop out, Rachelle pressured Dall to move his band onto the main stage for the Summer 2007 tour. After some time, it finally happened, and Vains of Jenna was added to the main stage for the entire North American 2007 summer tour. The band also toured the US on the Viva La Bands Tour along with Cradle of Filth, Gwar, and CKY in fall 2007. In late 2008 and early 2009, the band toured parts of Europe, including the UK, Italy, Scotland, Denmark, and Sweden. This included a spot on the Sweden Rock Festival in June 2009. Vains of Jenna then returned to the United States to record a new album. The new disc was produced by Brent Woods (Wildside). It included a cover of \"Refugee\" by Tom Petty, among other songs. The band released a new song, \"Get It On\", on iTunes in July 2009. On 15 September, Vains of Jenna released their second full-length album, The Art of Telling Lies.

The last Buell motorcycle produced through Harley-Davidson was in October 30, 2009, bringing the number manufactured to 136,923.In November 2009, Erik Buell announced the launch of Erik Buell Racing, an independent company run by Erik Buell which initially produced race-only versions of the 1125R model, then subsequently offered an updated 1190RS model for the street or the track, and produced further improved 1190RX and 1190SX models which are intended for street or track use.In February 2021, Buell Motorcycles announced they are back in production under the new ownership of Erik Buell Racing (EBR). Buell announced they will use the superbike platforms developed from 2011 to 2020 to build out their model line up to approximately ten models in 2024. The models will include variations for touring, dirt, adventure, and cruisers.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "740_17983", "text": "The first Buell motorcycle, the RW750, was built in 1983 purely for competition in the AMA Formula 1 motorcycle road racing championship.  At that time, Erik Buell was a top contending privateer motorcycle racer. After completion of the first two RW750 racing machines, one of which was sold to another racing team, the Formula 1 series was canceled. Erik Buell then turned his focus towards racing-inspired, street-going machines using engines manufactured by Harley.\nIn 1987 Rockville Harley-Davidson in Rockville, MD (now District Harley-Davidson / District Cycles, formerly Battley Harley-Davidson / Battley Cycles in Gaithersburg, MD) became the world's first Buell dealership and the owner, Devin Battley has Buell #1, an RR1000 in his personal collection.In 1993, Harley-Davidson purchased 49% of Buell, investing $500,000 and taking Erik Buell's house as security. Erik Buell took the deal, against strong advice from his attorney. Harley-Davidson CEO Jeffrey Bleustein had bought it as a skunkworks development.In 1994, Buell created the Buell Riders Adventure Group (BRAG) which hosted events around the country. Buell discontinued BRAG in 2006, stating the changes would improve, \"the privileges and ownership experience for all Buell owners more than ever before.\"In 1998, Harley-Davidson bought a majority stake and took control of Buell Motorcycle Company, and the company became a subsidiary. Since then, Buell has used modified Harley-Davidson engines, primarily from the Sportster, to power its motorcycles.\n\nMost Buell motorcycles use four-stroke air-cooled V-twin engines, originally built for XR1000 Sportster.  After these were depleted, a basic 1200 Sportster engine was used. In 1995, the engines were upgraded with Buell engineered high-performance parts and further upgraded in 1998.\nThe liquid-cooled Harley V-Rod motor, developed by Harley-Davidson then made street legal according to the EPA by Porsche, was originally an Erik Buell project, designed for a fully faired AMA Superbike Buell by 1998. Harley decided the engine should also be used in a sport-cruiser, then took over development, making it \"too big, too heavy, too expensive and too late\" for Buell.Harley-Davidson forced Buell to follow the rigid product planning and distribution process beginning in the 1990s, with the philosophy that Buell was the starter brand, and customers would eventually trade up to a Harley. By 2008, Harley's credit arm, Harley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS), was struggling, and the lower resale value of Buell motorcycles meant that new bike sales were significantly affected. When Harley CEO Keith Wandell was hired, he immediately questioned why Harley even owned Buell. Wandell, who had never been on a Harley before being hired, was heard talking about \"Erik's racing hobby\", and questioned \"why anyone would even want to ride a sportbike\". He organized a team to analyze \"the adrenaline market\", and concluded that sportbikes would encounter high competition and low profits, while cruisers had high returns.On Thursday, October 15, 2009, Harley-Davidson Inc. announced the end of production of Buell Motorcycles in order to focus more on the Harley-Davidson brand. Selling Buell was not legitimately considered, as Harley didn't want their Harley dealerships to sell an outside brand, and Harley didn't feel Buell had much value without the dealer network. In a news release on the Buell website the same day, company officials thanked customers, employees, and dealers for \"an unforgettable ride\". Closing the Buell brand was estimated to cost Harley approximately the same as their total investment in Buell over the past 25 years. Erik Buell immediately began looking for outside buyers, finding BRP (who owns the Austrian Rotax engine manufacturer BRP-Powertrain) a good choice, especially since Harley would have to pay Rotax \"an eight-figure sum\" for the 1,125 cc engine contract.Erik Buell later founded Erik Buell Racing to provide support for 1125 and XB privateer race efforts.On Thursday, February 18, 2021 Buell Motorcycles announced they are back in production under new ownership with additional models in development.

It emerged from his 1973 Mujama al-Islamiya Islamic charity affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian legislative election by campaigning on clean government without corruption, combined with affirmation of Palestinians\u2019 right to armed struggle against the Israeli occupation, thus winning a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council. In 2007, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip from rival Palestinian faction Fatah, which it has governed since separately from the Palestinian National Authority. This was followed by an Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip with Egyptian support, and multiple wars with Israel, including in 2008\u201309, 2012, 2014, and 2021. The ongoing 2023 war began after Hamas launched an attack, killing both civilians and soldiers, and taking hostages back to Gaza. The attack has been described as the biggest military setback for Israel since the 1973 Arab\u2013Israeli War, which Israel has responded to in an ongoing ground invasion of Gaza.Hamas promotes Palestinian nationalism in an Islamic context. While initially seeking a state in all of Mandatory Palestine, Hamas began acquiescing to 1967 borders in the agreements it signed with Fatah in 2005, 2006 and 2007 In 2017, Hamas released a new charter that supported a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders without recognizing Israel. Hamas's repeated offers of a truce (for a period of 10\u2013100 years) based on the 1967 borders are seen by many as consistent with a two-state solution. Others say that Hamas retains the long-term objective of establishing one state in former Mandatory Palestine. The 1988 Hamas charter was widely described as antisemitic. The revised 2017 Hamas Charter stated that Hamas's struggle was with Zionists, not Jews.Hamas has carried out attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians, including suicide bombings and indiscriminate rocket attacks. These actions have led human rights groups to accuse it of war crimes.

Those three albums featured the band's \"classic\" lineup, which consisted of Bolan, Sabo, Hill, drummer Rob Affuso and frontman Sebastian Bach. The band had sold 20 million albums worldwide by the end of 1996. Amid rising tensions, Bach was fired and Affuso left Skid Row towards the end of that year, after which the band entered a three-year hiatus.\nSkid Row reformed in 1999, with Johnny Solinger as Bach's replacement and a revolving cast of drummers, the latest being Rob Hammersmith.

They were signed to local indie label CherryDisc Records and released their self-titled five-track EP in 1998. They gained a loyal local following and went on to win the 1999 WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble. CherryDisc Records were bought out by Roadrunner Records, who released The Sheila Divine's  first full-length album New Parade in 1999. It received critical praise from local press and spawned the college radio hit Hum. The album featured re-recorded versions of songs that appeared on their first EP, as well as several brand new songs (the Japanese import edition featured two additional songs unavailable on the domestic release, \"Secret Rendezvous\" and \"Weightless,\" the latter of which had also been released as the b-side to the then-titled \"Criminal,\" the band's only released vinyl 7-inch). By the end of 1999 New Parade received very positive comments in the major press in Belgium, e.g. Knack (magazine). The single Like a criminal reached the radio chart De Afrekening and was included on the compilation album De Afrekening 21.In late 2000, the band was hard at work on their second album when they added Colin Decker as a second guitarist to broaden their sound. The band released their second album, Where Have My Countrymen Gone, in March 2001 on Co-Op Pop Records. Later that year, in August, Shawn Sears left the band to spend more time with his recently born child. Following a handful of shows with fill-ins Pete Caldes (The Gravel Pit/The Gentlemen) and Paul Buckley (Orbit), drummer Ryan Dolan replaced Sears a month later; Dolan had previously been in the band Lincolnville with guitarist Colin Decker. The Sheila Divine continued to tour constantly and created a large fan base that included both people who would see them across the country and others who would record live shows to share. The band was always generous to bootleggers and allowed video and/or audio taping at all shows.\nThe band released the six-track EP Secret Society in September 2002 (Arena Rock Recording Co.). They embarked on a non-stop world tour of China, Europe, and then across the United States and back. This rigorous schedule would prove to be the band's undoing. While at a show in Milwaukee, a confrontation with Jim resulted in Aaron throwing his guitar down and announcing that the band was breaking up. Upon returning home, the band stated they would not break up on their website but would instead take time off. Aaron Perrino went on to start recording songs in the studio by himself, which would end up on the War Chords EP, the debut release of his new solo project, Dear Leader. The Sheila Divine officially announced their demise on their website in April 2003 and played two farewell shows in October at The Paradise in Boston, Massachusetts.  The sold-out shows were attended by fans who had traveled from as far away as Belgium. The 2nd show was subsequently released as a DVD in 2007 entitled Funeral.\nOn December 31, 2005, The Sheila Divine played a reunion show at Bill's Bar on Landsdowne Street in Boston.

The Royal Mint produced these until Ireland established its own Currency Centre in Dublin in 1978.\nDuring World War II, the Mint was important in ensuring people were paid for their services with hard currency rather than banknotes. Under Operation Bernhard, the Nazis planned to collapse the British economy by flooding the country with forged notes, leading the Bank of England to stop issuing banknotes of \u00a310 and above. To meet these demands, the Mint doubled its output so that by 1943 it was minting around 700 million coins a year despite the constant threat of being bombed. The Deputy Master of the Mint, John Craig, recognised the dangers to the Mint and introduced several measures to ensure the Mint could continue to operate in the event of a disaster. Craig added emergency water supplies, reinforced the Mint's basement to act as an air-raid shelter and even accepted employment of women for the first time. For most of the war, the mint managed to escape most of the destruction of the Blitz, but in December 1940 three members of staff were killed in an air raid. Around the same time, an auxiliary mint was set up at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, which had been requisitioned for the war effort. Staff and machinery from Tower Hill were moved to the site, which started production in June 1941 and operated for the duration of the war. Over the course of the war, the Royal Mint was hit on several occasions, and at one point was put out of commission for three weeks.

Swan & Hunter merged with Wigham Richardson (founded by John Wigham Richardson as Neptune Works in 1860), specifically to bid for the important contract to build RMS Mauretania on behalf of Cunard. Their bid was successful, and the new company, Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd, went on to build what was to become, in its day, the most famous oceangoing liner in the world. Also in 1903, the Company took a controlling interest in the Wallsend Slipway & Engineering Company, which was an early licensed manufacturer of Parsons steam turbine engines, which enabled Mauretania to achieve her great speed. Mauretania was launched from Wallsend on 20 September 1906 by the Duchess of Roxburghe. The firm expanded rapidly in the early part of the twentieth century, acquiring the Glasgow-based Barclay Curle in 1912.In 1966, Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson merged with Smiths Dock Company to form Associated Shipbuilders, which later became Swan Hunter Group. Following the publication of the Geddes Report recommending rationalisation in British shipbuilding, the Company went on to acquire Clelands Shipbuilding Company and John Readhead & Sons in 1967. Meanwhile, Swan Hunter inherited both the Naval Yard at High Walker on the River Tyne of Vickers-Armstrongs and the Hebburn Yard of Hawthorn Leslie in 1968. In 1973 further expansion came with the purchase of Palmers Dock at Hebburn from Vickers-Armstrongs.Then in 1977, Swan Hunter Group was nationalised as part of British Shipbuilders. The former flagship of the Royal Navy, HMS Ark Royal was built at Swan Hunter during this period, entering service in 1985.The Company was privatised again in 1987 but decided to close its Neptune Yard in 1988. It was then forced to call in the receivers when the UK government awarded the contract for HMS Ocean to Kvaerner Govan in 1993. The receiver took steps to break up the business. However, the main shipyard in Wallsend was bought out from receivership by Jaap Kroese, a Dutch millionaire. The yard subsequently undertook several ad-hoc ship repair and conversion projects for private-sector customers.\nIn 2000, Swan Hunter was awarded the contract to design and build two (Auxiliary) Landing Ship Dock ships for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary with two other ships being built by BAE Systems Naval Ships: the cost of the two Swan Hunter ships was to be \u00a3210 million including \u00a362 million for lead yard services, with an inservice date of 2004. By July 2006, the costs had risen to \u00a3309 million and only one ship had been delivered. As a result of this, the second ship RFA Lyme Bay was transferred to BAE Systems Govan in Glasgow for completion.In 2001, Swan Hunter acquired Kv\u00e6rner's Port Clarence offshore yard at Teesside but then in 2006 sold it to Wilton Engineering Group.In November 2006, after the failure to complete Lyme Bay within budget and resulting exclusion from future Royal Navy shipbuilding projects, Jaap Kroese announced that the business was effectively finished and placed the Wallsend Yard's iconic cranes up for sale. He also said that he was actively looking for a buyer for the land. During this time, Lyme Bay's earlier sister ship, Largs Bay, was noted as the last ship to be built and fully completed by Swan Hunter. In April 2007, Swan Hunter's cranes, along with its floating dock and other equipment, were sold to Bharati Shipyards, India's second-largest private-sector shipbuilder. The entire plant machinery and equipment from Swan Hunter was dismantled and transported to India over six months to be rebuilt at Bharati Shipyards.Swan's performed the conceptual design of Pioneering Spirit, provisionally named Pieter Schelte, the world's largest platform installation/decommissioning and pipelay vessel.

Since 2006 there have been two separate companies creating Feiyue shoes: Da Fu Rubber and its subsidiary manufacturer, Double Coin Holdings, and a French company operating separately from the original Chinese company.A number of performers wore Feiyue China shoes during the opening of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Actor Orlando Bloom was spotted wearing the French version of Feiyue shoes.The Chinese factory has 3,000 employees producing 36,000 pairs a day, with an average of 5,000,000 pairs sold in China yearly.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "740_18162", "text": "Feiyue's roots can be traced to the 1920s when cloth shoes were manufactured in Shanghai. In 1958, DaFu Rubber Company designed and produced a kind of civil shoe known as \"Feiyue,\" a modification of the cloth shoes used by the Shaolin monks. They gained popularity during the 1930s for their robustness, flexibility, and comfort, which were considered essential requirements for martial arts and various forms of athletics. The shoes are a staple for almost all wushu practitioners and athletes in China, with the shoes being used by Shaolin monks and Kung Fu masters.\nIn 1963, using Feiyue and double arrow-labeled chevrons with \"Feiyue track and field,\" the company became the best-selling shoe in China with an output of 1,616,000 pairs. By the 1980s, Feiyue sold about 4 million pairs yearly. With the opening up of China and the associated cultural and economic shifts, the sneaker began to lose prominence in China, and by the end of the 1990s, the brand started selling in bulk due to low demand. Once a highly regarded brand, by then only elder people and martial arts practitioners valued it as a cheap and durable brand. In 2003, Shanghai Shenglong relaunched the production of shoes.In 2005, Patrice Bastian got together with a group of artists to change the brand name. In February 2006, they launched the first French-designed Feiyue Shoe collection.The DaFu Rubber Company reorganized and sold the rights to Feiyue to the \"Shuang Qian Group Co. Ltd,\" in 2009. That company leased manufacturing back to DaFu and another manufacturer, \"Top One\" (\u5927\u535a\u6587).\n\nIn 2014, BBC International, the Boca Raton, Florida-based footwear firm, acquired the French Feiyue shoe company. Upon working with BBC, Feiyue's men's, women's, and children's collections were updated and globally introduced in Spring of 2015.\nBBC has made a large new collection that builds on its existing brand. It uses high-quality materials like leather.In 2015, BBC International Launched a collaboration with Feiyue and Peanuts for a limited-edition collection. Before BBC's acquisition deal in August 2014, Feiyue had major success in collaborations, including collections with Celine, Andr\u00e9, Casio, Bonton, NSBQ, and more; and continuing with other collaborations beginning with Peanuts.The American Feiyue company collaborated in 2016 with the Solid & Striped clothing company, with textiles based on Solid & Striped designs.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "740_18163", "text": "A dispute exists surrounding the trademark and intellectual property rights to Feiyue between the United States-owned company, Feiyue International, LLC, and Shanghai Da Fu Rubber Co, the company that originally manufactured the shoe.

A sneaker collector, Bastien traveled to the factory to buy his lifetime supply and ended up making a bid to buy the brand (with partners Nicolas Seguy and Clement Fauth), financing the purchase by selling his sneaker collection. However, Da Fu maintains that Bastien made this purchase from a manufacturer and not from them, the original company, having not heard of the Bastian at all until 2007. In 2017, Bastian claims that he didn't know exactly who owned the factory he purchased the brand from.Da Fu retains the trademark rights to Feiyue in China, but the US-based Feiyue holds the rights in much of the world, including France, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan. Da Fu took Feiyue International, LLC to court for the rights in France, but lost the lawsuit.

The kingdom was founded by Mayurasharma in c.\u2009345, and at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions. An indication of their imperial ambitions is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers, and the marital relations they kept with other kingdoms and empires, such as the Vakatakas and Guptas of northern India. Mayurasharma defeated the armies of the Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with the help of some native tribes and claimed sovereignty. The Kadamba power reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma.\nThe Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with autonomy. From the mid-6th century the dynasty continued to rule as a vassal of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties. Notable among these are the Kadambas of Goa, the Kadambas of Halasi and the Kadambas of Hangal. During the pre-Kadamba era the ruling families that controlled the Karnataka region, the Mauryas and later the Satavahanas, were not natives of the region and therefore the nucleus of power resided outside present-day Karnataka. The Kadambas were the first indigenous dynasty to use Kannada, the language of the soil, at an administrative level.

It specialises in manufacturing portable radios, tonearms, speakers, and communications equipment. It was later headed by the founder's younger brother Niro Nakamichi. The company was originally established as a research and development firm in electronics and optics but later became known as a manufacturer of quality audio products. While its cassette decks were particularly well known, the company is also credited with audio innovations, such as self-centring record players, high-end DAT recorders, and ultra-compact slot-loading CD changers.\nIn the 1950s, Nakamichi developed one of the first open reel tape recorders in Japan under the Magic Tone brand. In 1957, it developed and made its own magnetic tape heads, as well as launching the Fidela 3-head Open Reel Stereo Tape Deck.\nBecause of its experience in manufacturing magnetic tape heads and equipment, in 1967 the company started making tape decks for a number of foreign manufacturers including Harman Kardon, KLH, Advent, Fisher, ELAC, Sylvania, Concord, Ampex and Motorola.\nFrom 1973, Nakamichi started to sell high-quality stereo cassette decks that benefited from the mass market's move away from reel-to-reel tape recorders to the cassette format. The Nakamichi 1000 and 700, made in the mid-1970s, had three heads, a dual capstan drive that reduced wow and flutter, and Dolby-B noise reduction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The dual capstan drive ensured superior head-to-tape contact, essentially eliminating reliance on the problematic spring pressure pads built into cassette housings. (Later models were fitted with pressure pad lifters that further improved tape travel stability and reduced head wear.) High-end features of these models included adjustable record head azimuth and Dolby calibration. The relatively high retail price of the 1000 and 700 prompted Nakamichi to offer lower-priced two-head models, such as the Nakamichi 500 and the wedge-shaped 600.\n\nThe Nakamichi 550 was a portable cassette recorder that had three microphone inputs: one for left channel, one for right channel, and one for a center blend channel. This recorder could run from batteries or AC and was used to make high quality recordings in the field.\nIn the late 1970s, Nakamichi updated and broadened its model range, with revised products including the Nakamichi 1000-II, the 700-II, and the lower-end 600-II. Nakamichi branched out into other audio components such as pre-amplifiers, power-amplifiers, tuners, receivers and later speakers.\nIn the early 1980s, Nakamichi's top-of-the-line cassette deck was the 1000ZXL, retailing at US$3,800, its price only exceeded by the 1000ZXL Limited at US$6,000. The updated 700ZXL sold for US$3,000, but Nakamichi also offered lower-end cassette decks under US$300.

Rabidoux and Beadle were veterans of the local hardcore scene, and had broken away from their respective bands out of a need to try something new musically. Their initial plans were to find a vocalist and bassist, but after recruiting Frattini, decided to remain an instrumental trio.\nTheir style draws heavily upon 70s progressive rock, particularly King Crimson and Yes, as well as fusion, hardcore, and math rock.  Their first self-titled 3 song EP was released in 2001, consisting of 2 studio tracks and 1 live track. Their 9 song full-length debut The Audio Medium followed in 2002.  The album explored a number of sonic landscapes, and revolved around the concept of the corporate music industry's control of the masses; that people are sheep to what music corporations and radio stations tell them to listen to, unaware of the real music that exists out there.  As in the medical world, a \"cancer conspiracy\" that hides the cure for cancer for the purpose of making money from the sick.  The album booklet contained a letter from a doctor by the name of Dr. Travis John, who shared similar views and who warned the band of the trouble they were getting themselves into.\nThe band toured extensively with bandmates on their label Big Wheel Recreation, and also opened for Oysterhead's first tour. Their shows were sometimes augmented by video projections.  In 2003, while at a show in New York City, their van was stolen, along with all of their equipment.  This was the last and most disastrous in a series of mishaps that had plagued their tours.  They decided to call it a day in late 2003.  There were reports on the Big Wheel Recreation website that they were working on a second album, and songs have surfaced on P2P filesharing programs. The album is now being released by both Gilead and Radar Recordings, after years of legal issues surrounding the intellectual rights of the music.  The album, Omega, was released in January 2008. Rabidoux is now working full-time as an engineer and producer at Strangeways Recording Studio in Providence, Rhode Island.  He has also reunited with Frattini to form Deleted Arrows \"[1]\".  Beadle currently plays in a classic rock inspired band called Township in Roslindale, Massachusetts.\nThe Cancer Conspiracy reunited for the Rocketsled reunion show in Burlington, Vermont on January 21, 2017. The original lineup of Daryl Rabidoux, Greg Beadle, and Brent Frattini played two songs, \"Broken Heartbeats Gathered and Rebroadcast\" and \"Summer of Andy.\" On April 27, 2018 it was announced that the band would perform again, this time as part of a celebration of the life of Cave In bassist Caleb Scofield.

Fisher was inspired by the sudden success of 'The Tower of Shoes' in an old Quonset hut in a non-retail industrial area of Sacramento, California, that drew crowds by advertising that no matter what brand, style or size of shoes a woman could want it was at The Tower of Shoes. And knowing that even Macy's, the biggest Levi's customer, was constantly running out of the best selling Levi's sizes, and colors, Fisher asked Haas to let him copy The Tower of Shoes' business model and apply it to Levi's products. Haas referred Fisher to Bud Robinson, his Director of Advertising, for what Haas assumed would be a quick refusal; but instead Robinson and Fisher carefully worked out a legal test plan for what was to become The Gap (named by Don's wife Doris Fisher). The name was a reference to the \"generation gap\".Fisher agreed to stock only Levi's apparel in every style and size, all grouped by size, and Levi's guaranteed The Gap to be never out of stock by overnight replenishment from Levi's San Jose, California warehouse. And finally, Robinson offered to pay 50% of The Gap's radio advertising upfront and avoided antitrust laws by offering the same marketing package to any store that agreed to sell nothing but Levi's products.\nFisher opened the first Gap store near City College on Ocean Avenue in Ingleside, San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its only merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records to attract teen customers.\nIn 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private label merchandise.In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Mickey Drexler. However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales. Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.\nIn 2007, Gap announced that it would \"focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline\". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis. He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units. The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic. In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc.

The original plan of the company was to close only 90 stores, however, they expanded the number as a consequence of the financial effects caused by the pandemic restrictions.

In July 1984, the band entered Triad Studios in Redmond, WA to record a five-song demo that received local airplay on KISW and KZOK. A month after recording their first demo in 1984 Jim Kovach was replaced by Ray Schwartz (using the name Raymond Black). This lineup recorded Heir Apparent's debut studio album Graceful Inheritance.\nThe album was released for European market in January 1986 by an independent French label Black Dragon Records. Supported by UK's Metal Hammer magazine, Heir Apparent toured France, Netherlands, and Germany in May and June 1986, originally as support act, but ending as headliner on tour with Savage Grace. Germany's Rock Hard gave the album a rating of 49/50 points in the February 1986 issue. Encouraged by good sales, Black Dragon re-released the album in October 1986, this time on CD, making it one of the first CD's released by an independent label in Europe. Graceful Inheritance was never released in the US in the 1980s, the group's home country. Graceful Inheritance was ranked No. 188 in the German hardcover book, Best of Rock and Metal \u2013 Top 500 Albums of All Time, published in 2005.\nFollowing the departure of lead vocalist Paul Davidson in 1987, Steve Benito took over the singing duties. Also, Heir Apparent's lineup was changed into a quintet by adding a keyboard player Mike Jackson. The new lineup recorded Heir Apparent's second studio album One Small Voice, which marked a musical shift towards the more technical sound of progressive metal, compared to the traditional heavy and power metal style of the previous release. In the summer of 1988, Heir Apparent had their first large arena performance, serving as an opening act for David Lee Roth, in the Seattle Center Coliseum. Soon after that, the band had signed a seven-album contract in 1988 in a joint venture with Capitol Records/Metal Blade, but suddenly dissolved even before the official release of One Small Voice in June 1989. Without a concert support, and with the emergence of grunge in the Seattle area, the second album did not reach the debut's underground success and critical acclaim until many years later, compelling the Greek label Arkeyn Steel Records to release a digitally remastered limited edition of One Small Voice with bonus tracks and a live DVD from a 1988 concert video of this lineup in 2010.\nThe Germany's label Hellion Records released the Triad demo compilation album in late 1999, along with the re-issue of the band's first album Graceful Inheritance. The band stayed inactive until 2000 when guitarist Terry Gorle was invited to perform at Wacken Open Air festival. Gorle reunited with the original rhythm section of Ray Schwartz and Derek Peace, with addition of Michael James Flatters on vocals. Following that comeback performance, Terry Gorle led several different lineups in concerts between 2002 and 2004. The 2004 lineup of Terry Gorle (guitar), Bobby Ferkovich (bass), Op Sakiya (keyboards), Jeff McCormack (drums) and Peter Orullian (vocals) reunited to perform in Europe in November 2006, headlining Germany's Keep It True festival, and two additional shows in Greece.\nIn January 2012, Heir Apparent's original musicians (Gorle, Schwartz, and Peace) performed with Jeff Carrell on vocals at the Metal Assault II Festival in Germany, with additional concerts in Athens and Thessaloniki Greece in celebration of the 25th anniversary of Graceful Inheritance.\nIn October 2015, Heir Apparent performed their first concert in Italy at the Play It Loud Festival with vocalist Will Shaw and keyboardist Op Sakiya joining Gorle, Peace, and Schwartz.

The name 'Luftschiffbau' is a German word meaning building of airships.\nThe company was founded by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin in 1908 as a formal entity to continue advancing his pioneering research into rigid airships. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin became the leading manufacturer in the field of large lighter-than-air vehicles; its products were used in both military and civilian capacities. The firm founded DELAG, the world's first airline to use an aircraft in revenue service, in 1909 on the back of public interest and using its own airships. During the First World War, Zeppelins were employed as the first long distance strategic bombers, launching numerous raids upon Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom. Following Count von Zeppelin's death in 1917, control of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin fell to Dr. Hugo Eckener, an enthusiastic proponent of the civil value of airships. However, Germany's zeppelins were claimed by the Allies as war reparations.\nThe company continued to innovate during the Interwar period, constructing the largest rigid airship in history, the LZ 129 Hindenburg, lead ship of the Hindenburg class. However, the company's fortunes soured during the Nazi era, particularly following the high-profile Hindenburg disaster. Its airships were grounded and scrapped in 1940 to produce fixed-wing combat aircraft for Nazi Germany's war machine. During the Second World War, the company became involved in the manufacture of the V2 rocket; its facilities were hit by Allied bombing raids and it all but ceased to exist in the final months of the conflict.

However, that activity was forbidden by the Council of Nuremberg, which stated that the manufacturing had to be developed by two different experts. Eventually, Staedtler's work helped to abolish that regulation, therefore facilitating the work of other pencil manufacturers in Nuremberg.The company was founded by Johann Sebastian Staedtler in 1835 as a pencil factory, first established in Nuremberg, but the roots of the company go back to 1662, when references to Friedrich Staedtler as a pencil-making craftsman were made in the city annals. Staedtler received permission from the municipal council to produce black lead, red chalk and pastel pencils in his industrial plant. In 1866, the company had 54 employees and produced 15,000 gross (2,160,000 pencils) per year.\nIn 1900, Staedtler registered the Mars brand (which represented the Ancient Roman god of war), using the name for some lines of products, also launching the head of Mars logo, and the Staedtler products are distributed in Italy in the same year. In 1901 the Noris brand was released by the company.In 1922 a United States subsidiary (located in New York) was established, It was followed by a Japanese subsidiary four years later. In 1937 the name was changed to Mars Pencil and Fountain Pen Factory and the product range was expanded to include mechanical writing instruments. In 1949, Staedtler began the production of ballpoint pens, which started to be widely used instead of fountain pens (although Staedtler still produces the latter today).\nIn 1950 propelling pencils (or mechanical pencils) began to be manufactured, the first being made out of wood.

Initially called Panic, the band was established by Greg Ginn, the guitarist, primary songwriter, and sole continuous member through multiple personnel changes in the band. They are widely considered to be one of the first hardcore punk bands, as well as one of the pioneers of post-hardcore. After breaking up in 1986, Black Flag reunited in 2003 and again in 2013. The second reunion lasted well over a year, during which they released their first studio album in nearly three decades, What The... (2013). The band announced their third reunion in January 2019.Black Flag's sound mixed the raw simplicity of the Ramones with atonal guitar solos and, in later years, frequent tempo shifts. The lyrics were written mostly by Ginn, and like other punk bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Black Flag voiced an anti-authoritarian and nonconformist message, in songs punctuated with descriptions of social isolation, neurosis, poverty, and paranoia. These themes were explored further when Henry Rollins joined the band as lead singer in 1981. Most of the band's material was released on Ginn's independent record label SST Records.\nOver the course of the 1980s, Black Flag's sound, as well as their notoriety, evolved. In addition to being central to the creation of hardcore punk, they were innovators in the first wave of American West Coast punk rock and are considered a key influence on punk subculture in the United States and abroad. Along with being among the earliest punk rock groups to incorporate elements and the influence of heavy metal melodies and rhythm, there were often overt free jazz and contemporary classical elements in their sound, especially in Ginn's guitar playing, and the band interspersed records and performances with instrumentals throughout their career. They also played longer, slower, and more complex songs at a time when other bands in their milieu performed a raw, fast, three-chord format. As a result, their extensive discography is more stylistically varied than many of their punk rock contemporaries.\nBlack Flag has been well-respected within the punk subculture, primarily for their tireless promotion of an autonomous DIY punk ethic and aesthetic. They are often regarded as pioneers in the movement of underground do-it-yourself record labels.

Black Flag also have used elements of styles such as jazz, blues, spoken word, heavy metal, blues rock, free jazz, math rock, and instrumental music.Throughout their ten-year career as a band, Black Flag's experiences became legendary, especially in the Southern California area. Much of the band's history is chronicled in Henry Rollins' own published tour diary Get in the Van. Black Flag were reportedly blacklisted by the LAPD and Hollywood rock clubs because of the destructiveness of their fans, though Rollins has claimed that police caused far more problems than they solved.\nSST Records, an independent American record label that was initially founded to release Black Flag's debut single, released recordings by influential bands such as Bad Brains, Minutemen, Descendents, Meat Puppets, and H\u00fcsker D\u00fc.

British acoustic artist and punk rocker Frank Turner has a Black Flag icon tattoo on his wrist and cites the band as one of his primary inspirations, particularly in regards to their work ethic. With Million Dead, if anything went wrong with their tour, Turner said they would \"Think Black Flag\".

Kurt soon switched to drums because he wanted his friend guitarist Felice Lococo to join the band but it didn't work, so they added Geoff Dimmick on guitar. John Joe Gurule was also added as the singer.Black Flag guitar player and SST Records owner Greg Ginn saw Overkill play and wanted them on his label but, soon after, Kurt and Ron grew tired of Gurule and expelled him from the band. Meanwhile, Black Flag had offered one of their roadies (and the Nig-Heist guitar player), Merrill Ward, to be their new singer before hiring Henry Rollins in 1981. Merrill refused and preferred joining Overkill. As the singer, Merrill helped the band gain recognition with his crazy stage antics, like lighting a jockstrap around his testicles on fire.Overkill entered the studio in early 1981 and recorded their first 7\" E.P., Hell's Getting Hotter with Spot, which was released on SST Records later that year. After hearing the record, Lococo changed his mind and joined Overkill after Dimmick quit due to family matters. The band also started recording their first LP, Triumph of the Will in 1982. The instrumental tracks were completed in April and then Overkill played shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and San Pedro before kicking Ward out of the band before he could record the vocal tracks. Merrill was fired for calling the rest of the band \"his backup band\" and claiming he was going to \"quit\" while talking to groupies.Stepmothers lead singer Steve Jones (not to be confused with the Sex Pistols Steve Jones) was then asked to take Merrill's place, even though, according to Jones: \"Merrill was one of the best front men [he'd] ever seen.\"  Jones re-wrote the lyrics and fronted the band for about 2 months, doing double duty with his main band The Stepmothers.  He then dropped out because, as he put it: \"The Stepmothers were [his] first love, and, frankly, the drive between Claremont, where the Stepmothers were based, and the Overkill rehearsal studio in South Bay was killing [him].\"  There was also reportedly some friction between Posh Boy and SST about this arrangement, although the Stepmothers were quite friendly with the Black Flag tribe and Greg and Chuck jumped on stage with the band at Stepmothers gigs on more than one occasion.Scott Kidd was then hired as the new singer and played a few shows. Brian Slagel from Metal Blade Records was present at one of these shows and asked Overkill to do a three-song demo. The song No Holds Barred was taken from that demo and appeared on the Metal Massacre II compilation released in 1982. In late '82, Overkill played at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, with the band Trauma and it was at that show that Metallica's singer-guitar player James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich saw Trauma bass player Cliff Burton for the first time and hired him.Tensions had also arose between the band and Greg Ginn after they fired Merrill and Ginn announced that he wouldn't let them finish Triumph of the Will. The band dissolved in July 1983 when Kidd, Lococo and Cordy told Markham they quit because they were angry at him for letting his girlfriend hurt the band, with her input that they should drop great metal songs for more AOR radio friendly material, that Cordy, and Lococo absolutely detested. Cordy joined Bitch as their bass player and Markham became the drummer for Dez Cadena's band D.C.3. Meanwhile, Merrill became an actor and joined Chuck Dukowski's post-Black Flag band SWA.Lococo visited SST Records in 1984 and Ginn told him he wished to release Triumph of the Will anyway, hoping Overkill would come back together but it didn't happen, so Ginn asked Merrill Ward to write some lyrics and do the vocal tracks. Triumph of the Will was finally released in 1985 on SST Records. In 1992, Ginn re-released the Overkill material on SST and rechristened the band as Overkill L.A.Lococo then formed Crackhead Killer in 2001, with fans of Overkill L.A. The band consisted of Steve Contreras on Guitar, Dr. Know Rick Contreras Jr. on Drums, Dr. Know and Rick Contreras Sr. on Bass, with Lococo rounding out the band on Guitar. The band recorded a 3 track demo that is available on the internet through a Google search of Crackhead Killer. The band never played live due to other personal obligations, and fell apart due to this. It was meant to be a fun project, and never something that was meant to be a career. Some internet articles thought this band was formed after SST Overkill split up but this will clear up the confusion.\nThe L.A. Overkill reunited in 2005 under the name SST Overkill, after a buzz was created when another punk band named Instigator covered \"Hells Getting Hotter\" on their CD. With Lococo on guitar, Markham on drums, Gurule on vocals and Dimmick switching from guitar to bass. They recorded demos that were released on the band's Myspace page. But soon, tensions started to arise again between Lococo and other members, due to musical differences. Lococo didn't want to continue only playing songs from the 80s, and was left out of regular band meetings to discuss the band's future. Lococo quit to be replaced by \"Rocking Ron\" Foster. Markham and Dimmick also quit to be replaced by Justin Herrera and Eliseo Almaviva-Matta while \"Thee\" Johnny Ray Soto was added on second guitar, leaving Gurule as the only original member.

Through its predecessor, Stockholms Enskilda Bank, it claims to be the first bank in the world to employ women.Stockholms Enskilda Bank was founded and run by the banking-involved Wallenberg family, and served as the lynchpin of their investment throughout most of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Even today, its successor is amongst the most valuable of the Wallenbergs' various companies, alongside corporations like SKF, Atlas Copco and Ericsson, which it used to have major shareholdings in until Swedish legislation changes in the early twentieth century; these holdings were taken over by Investor AB, still primarily owned by the Wallenberg family today.Skandinaviska Banken was founded as the Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget, one of the projects of the Scandinavian movement. Thanks to the efforts of Andr\u00e9 Oscar Wallenberg, Skandinaviska Banken was initially founded and headquartered in Gothenburg rather than Copenhagen, contrary to the wishes of Danish financier Carl Frederik Tietgen; its headquarters was later moved to Stockholm. After its founding, the bank expanded throughout Scandinavia and eventually the rest of the Nordic region until its merger in 1972.In 1997, SEB acquired the insurance company Trygg-Hansa, and in 1998, the company changed its Swedish-market logo and brand name from SE-Banken to SEB.

The plan was to build a parkway to connect the New Jersey Palisades with the state parks along the Hudson River in Rockland and Orange counties. Welch would soon garner the support of John D. Rockefeller, who donated 700 acres (2.8 km2) of land along the New Jersey Palisades overlooking the Hudson River in 1933. With this favorable momentum for the new route, the proposed route was accepted as a Civil Works Administration project under Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal coalition. However, the New Jersey Highway Commission did not support construction, so the idea of a parkway was put on hold. Instead, they built an 8 mile (13 km) road along the western bank of the Hudson River called the Henry Hudson Drive, a small scenic road that is a precursor to the Parkway and is still open today.During the 1940s, Rockefeller renewed the push for a parkway along the New Jersey Palisades, and teamed with ultimate PIP planner, Robert Moses, to establish and design the parkway. The plan originally was to have the PIP stretch from the Garden State Parkway, along the Hudson River, to the George Washington Bridge, and then north along its present-day route ending at the Bear Mountain Bridge. This southern extension was never built, but construction began on the current PIP in New York on April 1, 1947. Construction on the New Jersey portion began about one year later, paralleling the nearby Henry Hudson Drive. Construction was delayed twice due to material shortages, but that did not stop the PIP from being opened in stages during the 1940s and 1950s.

Sobey, a former carpenter, in 1907 as a meat delivery business.\nIn 1921, Sobey's son, Frank, became a partner of the company and added six new grocery stores serving the Pictou County and Antigonish County regions. In 1946, Sobey's opened its first supermarket in New Glasgow after purchasing the operations to Barker Store. By this time, Frank was the first president of J. W. Sobey Stores Limited. By late 1977, Sobeys had 65 store locations.The chain eventually expanded throughout Atlantic Canada. During most of the second half of the 20th century, it was the region's dominant grocer. In the 1980s, Sobeys expanded into southern Ontario, challenging Loblaws on its \"home turf\", thereby igniting what came to be a nationwide battle for market supremacy.\nSobeys had significant stakes in New England grocer Hannaford, Quebec grocer Provigo (which owned California grocer Petrini\u2019s), and US wholesaler Nash Finch Company until the 1990s. In 1998, Sobeys became the second-largest grocer in the country after purchasing the Oshawa Group, owners of the IGA franchise across Canada, along with several regional chains in Ontario, in addition to various food service and wholesale companies.\nIn 2002, Sobeys undertook major changes in its store design and customer service policies with the introduction of \"Ready to serve\". This initiative was reportedly an attempt to emulate the successful moves of the Publix supermarket chain in the southern United States.In 2005, Sobeys lost a bidding war with Quebec-based Metro to acquire A&P Canada, operator of several Ontario supermarket chains. The all-cash offer made by Sobeys was reportedly the highest bid for the chain, but the U.S. parent, The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, ultimately accepted Metro's $1.7 billion cash-and-stock offer. It is also suggested that the Sobey family was unwilling to cede any control to the Tengelmann Group, the ultimate parent company of A&P at the time. Though Sobeys remained the second largest grocery chain in Canada, it was the third place chain in most of the provinces outside the Atlantic region, and the successful purchase of A&P Canada would have helped to bolster its position in Ontario.\nIn 2007, Sobeys announced a $253 million takeover offer for the Thrifty Foods chain in British Columbia.In September 2011, Sobeys' wholesale division signed a long-term distribution agreement with American retailer Target for the supply of select food and grocery products to its Canadian stores. In March 2012, Sobeys acquired 236 Shell gas station locations in Quebec and Atlantic Canada.In June 2013, Sobeys announced the purchase of Safeway's Canadian operations for $5.8 billion, subject to regulatory approval. The acquisition added Safeway's 214 locations, primarily located in Western Canada, to its portfolio. As a condition of the deal imposed by the Competition Bureau in October 2013, Sobeys was required to sell 23 of its retail locations to other companies. Sobeys sold 29 of its locations, which included 18 Safeway stores. Fifteen were sold to Overwaitea Food Group (particularly in British Columbia and Alberta), and fourteen were sold to affiliates of Federated Co-operatives (particularly in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) for $430 million in total. In June 2014, Sobeys announced that it would, in the wake of the Safeway purchase, close 50 of its \"underperforming\" locations. The stores affected were primarily in Western Canada, although some in Ontario and the Atlantic region were also affected. In 2015, Sobeys acquired certain assets and select liabilities of Co-op Atlantic.In July 2016, Empire Company CEO Marc Poulin abruptly left the company after Sobeys reported a $942.6 million loss, which was credited to difficulties in integrating the Safeway chain into Sobeys overall operations. The Financial Post also reported that changes made by Sobeys, including the discontinuation of its popular loyalty program, the replacement of Safeway's house brands with Sobeys' brands, reports of poorly stocked inventories at Safeway locations, had impacted the chain's customer loyalty.In January 2018, Sobeys announced an agreement with Ocado to open an e-commerce grocery fulfilment centre in Toronto during late 2020. In contrast, Sobeys-owned Thrifty Foods and IGA use their stores as fulfilment centres for online orders.In late January 2018, Sobeys announced that it would, in the wake of the Safeway purchase, close an additional 10 of its \"underperforming\" locations. The stores affected were in the Fraser Valley Area of British Columbia in Western Canada, and were closed on May 5 with the exception of one of the ten stores that were closed on July 28. Some of the stores affected would reopen as FreshCo. As part of the FreshCo expansion in Western Canada, 22 locations have been confirmed, including the first two Chalo! FreshCo stores out West in Surrey, B.C.\nIn July 2019, Sobeys announced it will be switching from plastic to paper grocery bags in all its stores by the end of 2020.In September 2023, David Sobey, former chief executive and chair of the Sobeys Inc. grocery store chain, died at the age of 92.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This was a light, easy to use movie camera, and is considered a rare collectable today. The firm was originally located in Boston, MA and moved to Clifton, NJ when purchased by Berkey Photo in 1968.\nIn 1970 they began to manufacture the Everflash series of cameras in Clifton that accepted Kodak's new 126 cartridge film, and several years later Everflash cameras that handled the then new Kodak 110 cartridge film. Keystone's claim to fame was their built in electronic flash rather than having to use a flash bulb or flash cube, which was popular then on many other cameras. Poor internal management structure led to many quality problems in the early 1970s and serious losses. Keystone later added its instant picture Everflash camera using Polaroid film again stressing the Everflash feature rather than Polaroid's use of the Flash Bar.\nFrom 1970 to 1977, Berkey accounted for 8.2% Of the sales in the camera market in the United States, reaching a peak of 10.2% In 1976.

The house is now in Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden.\nThe Fin, Fur and Feather Folk was founded in Croydon by Eliza Phillips, Etta Lemon, Catherine Hall, Hannah Poland and others.The groups gained in popularity and amalgamated in 1891 to form the Society for the Protection of Birds in London. The Society gained its Royal Charter in 1904.The original members of the SPB were all women who campaigned against the fashion of the time for women to wear exotic feathers in hats, and the consequent encouragement of \"plume hunting\". To this end the Society had two simple rules:\n\nThat Members shall discourage the wanton destruction of Birds, and interest themselves generally in their protection\nThat Lady-Members shall refrain from wearing the feathers of any bird not killed for purposes of food, the ostrich only excepted.\nAt the time of founding, the trade in plumage for use in hats was very large: in the first quarter of 1884, almost 7,000 bird-of-paradise skins were being imported to Britain, along with 400,000 birds from West India and Brazil, and 360,000 birds from East India.In 1890, the society published its first leaflet, entitled Destruction of Ornamental-Plumaged Birds, aimed at saving the egret population by informing wealthy women of the environmental damage wrought by the use of feathers in fashion. A later 1897 publication, Bird Food in Winter, aimed to address the use of berries as winter decoration and encouraged the use of synthetic berries to preserve the birds food source. In 1897 the SPB distributed over 16,000 letters and 50,000 leaflets and by 1898 had 20,000 members.The Society attracted support from some women of high social standing who belonged to the social classes that popularised the wearing of feathered hats, including the Duchess of Portland (who became the Society's first President) and the Ranee of Sarawak. As the organisation began to attract the support of many other influential figures, both male and female, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton, it gained in popularity and attracted many new members. The society received a Royal Charter in 1904 from Edward VII, just 15 years after its founding, and was instrumental in petitioning the Parliament of the United Kingdom to introduce laws banning the use of plumage in clothing.At the time that the Society was founded in Britain, similar societies were also founded in other European countries.

In 1911, the creamery began to produce small quantities of ice cream.By 1919, the Creamery was in financial trouble and considered closing its doors. The board of directors hired E.F. Kruse, a 23-year-old former schoolteacher, to take over the company on April 1, 1919. Kruse refused to accept a salary for his first few months in the position so that the company would not be placed in further debt.  Under his leadership, the company expanded its production of ice cream to the surrounding Brenham area and soon became profitable. At his suggestion, the company was renamed Blue Bell Creameries in 1930 after Kruse's favorite wildflower the Texas bluebell, which, like ice cream, thrives during the summer.Until 1936, the creamery made ice cream by the batch. It could create a 10-US-gallon (38 L) batch of ice cream every 20 minutes. That same year, in 1936, the company purchased its first continuous ice cream freezer, which could make 80 US gallons (300 L) of ice cream per hour. The ice cream would run through a spigot, allowing it to be poured into any size container.Kruse was diagnosed with cancer in 1951 and died within 8 weeks. His sons Ed and Howard took over leadership of the company. By the 1960s, the company completely abandoned the production of butter and began focusing solely on ice cream. After many years of selling ice cream only in Brenham, the company began selling its ice cream in the Houston area, eventually expanding throughout most of Texas including the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex and the state capital of Austin. By the end of the 1970s, sales had quadrupled, and by 1980 the creamery was producing over 10 million gallons (37,850,000 liters) of ice cream per year, earning $30 million annually.In 1989, Blue Bell began selling its ice cream in Oklahoma, and throughout the 1990s expansion pushed throughout the South Central and Southern United States, eventually expanding out to New Orleans and Jackson, Mississippi. In 1992, Blue Bell built a new manufacturing facility in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.  Four years later, in 1996, Blue Bell opened a third manufacturing facility in Sylacauga, Alabama, southeast of Birmingham, and eventually expanded into Atlanta and Miami. Once Blue Bell establishes itself within a market, word-of-mouth usually ensures that consumers in adjacent areas become aware of the brand. Blue Bell has been slow to expand: company executives say they thoroughly research each new market and ensure that all employees in the new markets are fully trained in Blue Bell practices so that product quality can be upheld. Blue Bell often tends to expand to markets during March each year, expanding to Colorado on March 14, 2011, followed by the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas of Virginia in 2013, and Las Vegas in 2014. These expansions are accompanied with the purchase and/or construction of distribution centers in new markets that serve areas within a 75-mile (121 km) radius.\nIn 2015, Blue Bell issued a series of recalls (see below for more on this) that eventually shut down production and led to all of its products being recalled on April 20, culminating in job cuts and furloughs (as well as the reduction of its 23-state sales territory) resulting from the shutdown the following May. In conjunction with factory cleanup procedures and agreements with state and federal authorities, the company returned to production three months later on a limited basis, returning its products to the market on August 31 in portions of Texas and Alabama as part of a five-phase plan to return to much of its pre-recall distribution territory, which has been reduced to 21 states based on Blue Bell's limited distribution capabilities in the near term.\nIn 2018, children of an interracial family posted an open letter on Facebook addressed to Blue Bell asking that the flavor \"The Great Divide\" (equal halves of chocolate and vanilla ice cream) be changed to \"Better Together\". While Blue Bell spokespersons reacted positively to the name change proposal, the post became controversial among some Facebook users who dismissed the original name as inoffensive.\nIn July 2019, The Blue Bell Creameries faced an issue that went viral after a teenage female licked one of their ice cream tubs at a Walmart in Lufkin, Texas, then placed it back in the freezer. She was later arrested. After the incident, multiple copycats were committed, and some were jailed. These incidents resulted with severe negative reactions that violating food in such a manner is dangerous to the public health, along with criticisms that no action is taken to punish any offenders and Blue Bell for not protecting their ice cream with a plastic seal.\nMid-March 2024 saw expansion to St. Louis, MO & East St. Louis, IL.", "hasanswer": false}]}

All three had been members of a thrash metal band, Psi.Kore, which were founded by Lamb's brother Chuck, guitarist Adam Boyle and bassist Lex Dourian in 1996; Lamb had joined in 1997 and Webster took Dourian's place in late 1998. The band recorded an EP with Chatterbox Records in 2000 and toured Australia widely before Bilbija was recruited in early 2002. Relations within the group pushed Chuck Lamb out and the remaining members decided to continue in a slightly different musical direction. In 1995, Bilbija had formed a death metal band called Deadspawn and with the eventual line-up of himself plus Dave Micallef (vocals, guitar), Bob Latsombath (bass) and Wayne Morris (drums), that group had released an album on Warhead Records in 1999 before eventually splitting up when Micallef left in mid-2001. Bilbija now recruited Micallef into his latest band, and Daysend was formed with guitarist Michael Kordek (from a death metal act called Automation and then, briefly, Infernal Method with Bilbija) also coming into the group. The line-up was only together briefly before Matt Lamb left, his place taken by Morris. Lamb has since played in a variety of Sydney rock and metal bands.\nA debut live show with Melbourne death metal band Earth was booked but Micallef quit Daysend before the show; the band played regardless as an instrumental act. Inheriting Psi.Kore's manager, Chatterbox owner Nik Tropiano, who had helped push that group to the verge of major success, Daysend was listed on the bill for the 2002 Metal for the Brain festival and slated to open for Austrian death metal band Pungent Stench shortly afterward, both without so much as having either a recording or a vocalist. However, Metal for the Brain was cancelled due to an insurance cost blow-out and Daysend had still not found a singer in time for the Pungent Stench tour. In January 2003, Simon Calabrese was recruited as lead vocalist. Calabrese had previously been with a nu metal act called Redsands that had recorded an EP before disbanding.\nWith Calabrese in place, Daysend immediately found themselves supporting Sweden's The Haunted in March and then on a national tour with the reformed Melbourne grindcore band Damaged. After that, Daysend spent ten days recording the debut album  Severance, which was released by Chatterbox in October. Severance was voted Best Australian Metal Album in a Triple J listeners poll soon after, an honour it shared with Renascent Misanthropy by Brisbane black metal band Astriaal.\n2004 saw Daysend touring heavily. They supported Slipknot, In Flames, Shadows Fall and Machine Head and toured nationally with Entombed. Severance was released in the United States by Metal Blade Records and by Locomotive in Europe in November. When the Metal for the Brain festival added two extra shows in Brisbane and Perth along with its regular Canberra fixture in February 2005, Daysend appeared at each. Two days before this, however, Kordek suddenly left the band. His replacement was Andrew Lilley, who had most recently served a brief spell with Melbourne thrash band Atomizer. Lilley's addition to Daysend caused some initial surprise as he had been fired from Psi.Kore in mid-2001, then coincidentally joined Infernal Method after Bilbija had left to join Psi.Kore. However, after learning the band's entire set in one emergency rehearsal, he slotted into the Daysend line-up.\nIn May 2005, Daysend toured the US for six weeks with Otep. On returning to Australia, the band split with both its management and with Lilley. Michael Kordek rejoined and some work began on a second album. Further activity was stalled however when Simon Calabrese left Daysend in May 2006. Within a short time, however, ex-Headcage vocalist Mark Halcroft (McKernan) joined the band. Playing just two shows with him, Daysend began recording The Warning in November 2006 with DW Norton, who had also produced the debut. Norton signed the band to his label Faultline and the album was released on 28 May 2007 ahead of Daysend's appearance at Sydney's two-day Come Together Festival. A national tour began soon after but at least one show was cancelled when Morris received an eye injury from a broken drumstick during a show in Sydney on 13 July.\nIn late November 2007, Michael Kordek left the band to follow \"other musical and non-musical interests\". He was replaced by Jason Turnbull in late 2007, playing his first show with the band on New Year's Eve. In July 2008 Daysend then travelled to New Zealand for a small tour with Subtract. August saw Daysend play a string of shows with Perth band Dyscord, and be the direct support for Trivium's one off Australian show at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney. In October, Daysend supported renowned UK metal band Carcass at Sydney's Metro Theatre, before playing a string of New South Wales shows with Dyscord, Psycroptic and the US deathcore band Whitechapel in early January 2009. Following this, Daysend began recording their third album as a four-piece since Turnbull had left the group. Within the Eye of Chaos was released on 19 February 2010, on the Stomp label. A national tour followed with Braithe Selby as a touring member. On 10 July 2010, the band played Utopia Records 30th Anniversary show which marked the return of Jason Turnbull to the line-up.\nDaysend played only a handful of shows throughout the year. In 2011 it was announced that Daysend would be touring Australia with Nevermore in June; however, that tour was cancelled. On 5 May, Daysend announced through their Facebook page that they were disbanding: \"The reason is not due to artistic differences or personal issues but rather that we feel we cannot continue with the band any longer.

So, it is likely that this baptism occurred on, or around, the Feast of St Hildulf, which Alex Woolf suggests may be the source of his uncommon name. John of Fordun and others supposed that Indulf had been king of Strathclyde in the reign of his predecessor, based on their understanding that the kingdom of Strathclyde had become a part of the kingdom of Alba in the 940s. This, however, is no longer accepted.The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: \"In his time oppidum Eden\", usually identified as Edinburgh, \"was evacuated, and abandoned to the Scots until the present day.\" This has been read as indicating that Lothian, or some large part of it, fell to Indulf at this time. However, the conquest of Lothian is likely to have been a process rather than a single event, and the frontier between the lands of the kings of Alba and Bernicia may have lain south and east of Edinburgh many years before Indulf's reign.Indulf's death is reported by the Chronicon Scotorum in 962, the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba adding that he was killed fighting Vikings near Cullen, at the Battle of Bauds. The Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n, however, claims that he died \"in the house of the same holy apostle, where his father [died]\", that is at the c\u00e9li d\u00e9 monastery of St Andrews.

The group was active between 1969 and 1979, enjoying success throughout the 1970s. The group had reunions in 1997, 2015 and 2020. Together, the group recorded eight full-length studio albums, as well as two live albums.\nThe group was highly influential on Brazilian popular music and Brazilian rock of the 1970s, combining various musical elements from genres such as samba, bossa nova, frevo, bai\u00e3o, choro, and rock n' roll. The group's music was also heavily influenced by 1970s counterculture and the emerging Tropic\u00e1lia artistic movement.\nThe group's original line-up consisted of Moraes Moreira (vocals and acoustic guitar), Paulinho Boca de Cantor (vocals), Pepeu Gomes (electric guitar), Baby Consuelo (vocals and percussion), and Luiz Galv\u00e3o (lyrics).\nThe group regularly collaborated with A Cor do Som, a sub-group within Novos Baianos, which consisted of Dadi Carvalho (bass), Jorginho Gomes (cavaquinho, drums and percussion), and Jos\u00e9 \"Baixinho\" Roberto (drums and percussion). Lu\u00eds Bolacha (percussion) additionally contributed to the group early in their career.\nNovos Baianos is considered one of the most important and revolutionary groups in Brazilian music, primarily as a result of the success and influence of their second studio album, Acabou Chorare.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "740_19049", "text": "Novos Baianos was formed in 1969 and performed publicly for the first time at a show titled \"Desembarque dos Bichos, Depois do Dil\u00favio\", presented in Salvador. During this time, the group consisted of Moreira, Boca de Cantor, Consuelo and Galv\u00e3o.In 1969, the group participated in the V Festival de M\u00fasica Popular Brasileira, playing the song 'De Vera'. The group's name originated from this performance, which was broadcast on the Rede Record television station, where festival producer, Marcos Ant\u00f4nio Riso exclaimed \"Bring up these novos baianos!\", referring to where the band originated from (\"Novos Baianos\" is Portuguese for \"new Bahians\"). This song would later be featured on the group's first studio album, \u00c9 Ferro na Boneca, which was recorded in 1970. Initially, the group's sound was a fusion of psychedelic rock with traditional folk elements originating from Brazil.Originally, the group only played with Pepeu Gomes and Jorginho Gomes during their live performances. However, as time progressed, Gomes started to gain an increasingly important role in the group. After he married Consuelo, Gomes became a full-fledged member of the group, and began arranging songs along with Moreira.\nIn the early 1970s, the group's music began to gravitate more towards the MPB genre, particularly due to Brazilian musician Jo\u00e3o Gilberto's influence, who frequently visited the group. In 1972, Novos Baianos moved to Cantinho do Vov\u00f4, a property located in Jacarepagu\u00e1, where the group members lived in a communal style. Shortly after moving onto the property, the group began writing and recording material for a new album, which was produced amidst the ongoing military dictatorship in Brazil at the time. As a response to the melancholic sound of their musical contemporaries, the group set out to create a record that would bring a sense of joyfulness to listeners in the face of the authoritarian regime that was in power at the time.\nThese recording sessions produced the group's second studio album, Acabou Chorare. The album was a commercial success, due in part to the extensive airplay of songs on Brazilian radio stations at the time of the album's release. The album contained some of the group's most popular songs, which included 'Brasil Pandeiro', 'Preta Pretinha', 'Mist\u00e9rio do Planeta' and 'Besta \u00e9 tu'. It was released on the Som Livre label in 1972, and years later would be ranked as the best Brazilian music album by Rolling Stone magazine. It was around this time that the group incorporated A Cor do Som as an auxiliary band.\n\nDuring this period, the group lived out of a garage, where they primarily focused on playing soccer and composing music. This period of time influenced the name of their third studio album, Novos Baianos F.C., recorded and released on the Continental label in 1973. The group had a strong hippie image during this time period.\nThe band released numerous records until their break-up in 1978. In 1974, they recorded the first album without Moreira, who decided to start his own solo career in the mid-1970s. As Moreira had previously been the primary composer and arranger of the band's songs (along with Galv\u00e3o and Gomes) throughout their previous albums, it was tremendous loss to the group. The remaining members of the group continued producing music after Moreira's departure, incorporating Gato F\u00e9lix to the group.In 1976, Carvalho left the group to begin recording and releasing original music with A Cor do Som. In his place, Novos Baianos substituted Didi, the brother of Pepeu Gomes, as the group's bassist. However, the group disbanded in 1979 due to various band members starting their own solo careers. Despite the band's dissolution, Novos Baianos' members reunited many times to celebrate special events (most notably in 1997 and 2015).\nIn 1997, Luiz Galv\u00e3o, published Anos 70: Novos e Baianos for Editora 34. In the book, he documents the group's history and its importance to Brazilian music. After Galv\u00e3o released the book, the group reunited, releasing  the live album Infinito Circular in 1997, which was recorded in Metropolitan, Rio de Janeiro. In 2007, Moreira published A Hist\u00f3ria dos Novos Baianos e Outros Versos, a cordel text on the group.\nIn 2009, the band reunited without Moreira to celebrate 40 years of Novos Baianos and their revolutionary role in Brazilian music. The group (with Moreira) later released their second live album in 2017, titled Acabou Chorare - Novos Baianos Se Encontram, which was recorded during the group's 2015-2018 tour.\nMoreira died of a heart attack on 13 April 2020, aged 72. Later that year, the remaining members of the group's original line-up reunited for a show at the Festival Coala music event, as a tribute to Moreira.

In subsequent announcements, he stated that the band will release a final album (originally planned to be a commemorative EP, but was then expanded to a full-length), in Baron Blood's memory, titled To the Depths We Descend.... Following this release, Necromantia will be disbanded, and no further material will be released.\nTo the Depths We Descend... was released on October 15, 2021. The album contains six new songs and re-recordings of two classic songs from the band's early demos. A number of previous band members make guest appearances to commemorate Baron Blood. Notably, it is the only Necromantia album not featuring an eight-string bass, which is substituted by standard rhythm guitar parts. This decision was made, according to The Magus, because \u201cthe use of the 8-string bass belongs to Baron Blood and it will remain with him\u201d.Necromantia was officially dissolved in December 2021, with The Magus stating that \"The band has now descended into the Abyss.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It arose through a process of syncretism between the traditional religions of West Africa, the Roman Catholic form of Christianity, and Haitian Vodou. No central authority is in control of Louisiana Voodoo, which is organized through autonomous groups.\nHistorical records reveal the names of various deities who were worshiped in Voodoo. Prominent among them were Blanc Dani, the Grand Zombi, and Papa L\u00e9bat. These were venerated at altars, where sacrifices were made to them. Spirits of the dead also played a prominent role in historical Voodoo, with some contemporary practitioners regarding the religion as a form of ancestor worship. Historical accounts suggest that in the 19th century, the saints played a prominent role, although amid the 20th-century revival, the veneration of deities from other African diasporic religions became common.\nThe production of charms, which are known as gris-gris, plays an important part.\nFrom the early 18th century, enslaved West Africans\u2014the majority of them Bambara and Kongo\u2014were brought to the French colony of Louisiana. There, their traditional religions would have syncretized with the Roman Catholic beliefs of the French. This continued as Louisiana came under Spanish control and was then purchased by the United States in 1803. In the early 19th century, many migrants fleeing the Haitian Revolution arrived in Louisiana, bringing with them Haitian Vodou, which contributed to the formation of Louisiana Voodoo. Although the religion was never banned, its practice was restricted through a range of laws regulating when and where black people could gather. Practiced secretly, it spread up the Mississippi River to Missouri. During the 19th century, practitioners such as Marie Laveau, attracted considerable attention. By the early 20th century, the public practice of Voodoo had heavily declined. After the 1960s, the New Orleans tourist industry increasingly used references to Voodoo to attract visitors, while a Voodoo revival took place, the practitioners of which often drew heavily on other African diasporic religions such as Haitian Vodou and Cuban Santer\u00eda.\nAlthough originating among African diasporic communities in New Orleans, Louisiana Voodoo has included white participants since at least the 19th century, and some contemporary Voodoo groups have a majority-white membership. The religion has long faced opposition from non-practitioners, who have characterized it as witchcraft and devil-worship, and many sensationalist portrayals of the religion have featured in popular culture.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "740_19174", "text": "Various academic sources describe Louisiana Voodoo as a religion, as do some practitioners. More specifically, it has been characterized as an African creole and an African American religion.\nLouisiana Voodoo has also been referred to as New Orleans Voodoo, and\u2014in some older texts\u2014Voodooism. The scholar Ina J. Fandrich described it as the \"Afro-Creole counterculture religion of southern Louisiana\"; it describes a religion that emerged along the banks of the Mississippi River, and especially in the city of New Orleans.Several different spellings of Voodoo have been used; alternatives have included Voudou and Vaudou.\nThe spelling Voodoo is sometimes used for the Louisiana practice to distinguish it from Haitian Vodou.\nIn some sources, practitioners are referred to as Voodoos themselves, and elsewhere as Voodooists. A related term is hoodoo, which may originally have been largely synonymous with Voodoo. Over time, hoodoo came to describe \"the brand of African American supernaturalism found along the Mississippi\", entailing the use of charms and spells that made little reference to deities; in this it differs from the specific religion characterized by the term Voodoo.Louisiana Voodoo is a secretive religion; in 1972, for instance, the historian Blake Touchstone noted that Louisiana Voodoo was then largely being practiced outside the public eye. Among some contemporary practitioners there is a tradition not to speak to non-adherents about Voodoo. Louisiana Voodoo has not remained static, but has adapted and changed over time; in its original form, it probably survived into the early 20th century. In the late 20th century there was a revival of Louisiana Voodoo, creating a tradition that \"more closely resembles\" Haitian Vodou and Cuban Santer\u00eda than the 19th-century Louisiana Voodoo that is described in historical accounts. Some 21st-century practitioners have also sought instruction from West African traditions, for instance, being initiated into West African Vodun.Voodoo is a largely oral tradition. It has no formal creed, not a specific sacred text, and has no unifying organized structure or hierarchy. Practitioners will often adapt Voodoo to suit their specific requirements, in doing so often mixing it with other religious traditions. Throughout its history, many Voodoo practitioners have also practiced Roman Catholicism.

Tallant noted that, as of the 1940s, about a third of the religion's practitioners were white.\nTallant also thought that about 80 percent of practitioners were female.Long noted that the \"Voodoo revival\" of the late 20th century had attracted many \"well-educated\" and middle-class Americans, both black and white. Glassman's group has been described as having a white-majority membership. In a 1995 article for The New York Times, Rick Bragg noted that many contemporary practitioners were \"white people \u2014 nose and tongue piercers, middle-aged intellectuals and men with foot-long ponytails \u2014 who enjoy the religion's drumming and cultural aspects.\" Osbey thought that this revival was appealing, especially to \"young-ish whites\", because they felt it offered \"something at once forbidden, magical and compelling in its dramatic appeal\"; in her view they were not real practitioners of Louisiana Voodoo because they do not descend from the ancestral spirits that the religion venerates.", "hasanswer": false}]}

These gangs were composed of nativist White Anglo-Saxon Protestants who were opposed to enfranchisement of the growing number of Irish Catholic refugees from the Great Famine. Street gangs, like the Bowery Boys, \"were bound by ethnic ties or nativist belief; the members tended to be deeply patriotic, and a common thread was the belief that the country was pretty well full, so that newcomers were not welcomed.\" Poole's gang was located near to the Five Points neighborhood, where many recent Irish Catholic immigrants settled. Five Points was located in what is now Chinatown in Lower Manhattan. Waves of Irish- and German-Americans moved into the Five Points as their first stop on the way to the American dream. In response to attacks by Poole and his followers, the Irish created their own street gangs. The Dead Rabbits were an Irish-membership gang and the biggest rival of Poole's Bowery Boys. Much of the hatred between the two gangs was based on racial and religious differences. \"For years the Bowery Boys and the Dead Rabbits waged a bitter feud, and a week seldom passed in which they did not come to blows, either along the Bowery, in the Five Points section.\" Both gangs were primarily brawlers and street fighters, another reason why William Poole was a well-known fighter, and most of their battling was done in open spaces.

They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, but their musical approach has changed over the years. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album Deep Purple in Rock. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies\". They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide.Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and were broken up for eight years from 1976 to 1984, with drummer Ian Paice being the band's only constant member. The first four line-ups, which constituted the band's original 1968\u20131976 run, are officially indicated as Mark I (1968\u20131969), Mark II (1969\u20131973), Mark III (1973\u20131975) and Mark IV (1975\u20131976). Mark I comprised the founding members of Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Rod Evans (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards), Paice (drums) and Nick Simper (bass), while Mark II was the most commercially successful line-up, with Ian Gillan and Roger Glover replacing Evans and Simper respectively. Mark III saw David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes replace Gillan and Glover respectively, while Mark IV featured Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore. The band split in July 1976, and Bolin died from a drug overdose five months later. Deep Purple reformed in 1984 with the Mark II line-up, which remained in place until Joe Lynn Turner replaced Gillan in 1989. Gillan rejoined in 1992, with Blackmore leaving for the second and final time the following year. He was replaced temporarily by Joe Satriani and then permanently by Steve Morse. In 2002, Lord retired and was replaced by Don Airey, which saw Deep Purple settle into its longest running line-up, unchanged for the next twenty years, until Morse announced his departure from the band in 2022. His place was taken by Simon McBride. Paice, Glover, Gillan, Airey and McBride comprise the current line-up of Deep Purple.\nDeep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme, and a poll on radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the \"most influential bands ever\".

Stylistically, the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s.\nThe album was not well received in the UK, where it sold very few copies and did not chart. In the US, on the other hand, it was a success and the single \"Hush\", an energetic rock track written by Joe South and originally recorded by Billy Joe Royal, became very popular at the time, reaching number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The good sales of the album and the intense radio play of the single contributed largely to the attention Deep Purple would get in their early US tours and also during the 1970s.

The company was later commissioned by Central Independent Television to produce Playbox, which demonstrated the ability for the company to produce their own characters. In 1989, The Magic Mirror and BOOM! marked the company's debut in the animation and live-action markets. The company at first produced puppet-based programmes, and their mascot was originally a female rag doll that was based on one that belonged to Wood's daughter.\nIn 1992, the company moved their operations to Stratford-upon-Avon and opened up The Ragdoll Shop.\nIn the mid-1990s, Ragdoll expanded operations to the United States, and signed a deal with The Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Company to sell their programmes in the market.\nIn 2000, Ragdoll dropped their rag doll mascot for a more simplistic logo designed by Lambie-Nairn, with the company also adopting a new name of Ragdoll Limited by that point. During that time, the company started to move away from puppet-based shows (which started with Teletubbies in 1997), by making animated cartoons. Ragdoll still produced live-action shows, but would use costumes and animatronics instead of puppets.\nIn October 2001, Ragdoll parted ways with Itsy Bitsy following a failure to reach an agreement with the company's majority owner, the Handleman Group.

Zamenhof first described the language in Dr. Esperanto's International Language (Esperanto: Unua Libro), which he published under the pseudonym Doktoro Esperanto. Early adopters of the language liked the name Esperanto and soon used it to describe his language. The word esperanto translates into English as \"one who hopes\".Within the range of constructed languages, Esperanto occupies a middle ground between \"naturalistic\" (imitating existing natural languages) and a priori (where features are not based on existing languages). Esperanto's vocabulary, syntax and semantics derive predominantly from languages of the Indo-European group. A substantial majority of its vocabulary (approximately 80%) derives from Romance languages, but it also contains elements derived from Germanic, Greek, and Slavic languages. One of the language's most notable features is its extensive system of derivation, where prefixes and suffixes may be freely combined with roots to generate words, making it possible to communicate effectively with a smaller set of words.\nEsperanto is the most successful constructed international auxiliary language, and the only such language with a sizeable population of native speakers, of which there are perhaps several thousand. Usage estimates are difficult, but two estimates put the number of people who know how to speak Esperanto at around 100,000. Concentration of speakers is highest in Europe, East Asia, and South America.

Their style is now recognized as a pioneering force in proto-punk; yet within a relatively short period of time, they began to employ more complex lyrical and instrumental arrangements that went beyond the typical garage band format.\nIn 1965, the band came together as a folk rock trio known as the Raggamuffins, before expanding to the quintet that was later rechristened the Music Machine. The group was known for their style of dress, clothing themselves in all-black attire. In 1966, the Music Machine was signed to Original Sound, and released its first single \"Talk Talk\" in the latter half of the year, with it reaching the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100.

The decade between 1953 and 1963 saw many foreign firms ordering Ghia designs, such as Volkswagen (the Karmann Ghia) and Volvo. Chrysler and its designer Virgil Exner became a close partner for 15 years, resulting in eighteen Chrysler Ghia Specials (1951\u201353), the K-310, the Chrysler Norseman, the Imperial Crown limousines (whose notable owners included Jackie Kennedy and Nelson Rockefeller), and others. There are even a few Ghia-bodied Ferraris. Ghia also participated in the short-lived Dual-Ghia venture. Production by Ghia was always in very low numbers, giving the company's products even greater exclusivity than those of the other Italian coachbuilders.In June 1953, Pierre Lefaucheux, Renault's chairman, requested Carrozzeria Ghia assistance with the Renault Dauphine.In 1953, Boano left for Fiat, the factory moved to via Agostino da Montefeltro, and Luigi Segre took over. Ghia then brought in Pietro Frua, appointing Frua as head of Ghia Design (1957\u201360), designing the Renault Floride. After Segre's death in 1963, Ghia was sold to Ramfis Trujillo in 1965, who in turn sold the company in 1967 to Alejandro de Tomaso, owner of a rival design house. De Tomaso never managed to run Ghia profitably and in 1970 he sold his shares to the Ford Motor Company. During this transition period, Ghia had partial involvement in the De Tomaso Pantera, a high-performance, mid-engined car using a Ford V8.From then on, the Ghia studios were an integral part of Ford of Europe's styling operation \u2013 producing mostly concept cars although some production models were styled by the firm \u2013 the most notable being the Ford Fiesta Mk1 in 1976, which was penned by Ghia's Tom Tjaarda. Aside from this, the most publicly visible sign of Ford's ownership of Ghia has been its use of the name to denote the luxury trim level of its European models for many years (below).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "26_49642", "text": "The Fondazione Merz was founded in 2005 in Turin, Italy, by Mario Merz's daughter Beatrice.
