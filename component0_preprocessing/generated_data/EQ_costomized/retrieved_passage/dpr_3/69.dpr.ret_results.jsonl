This was the genesis of quantum theory.\nAfter having attended realgymnasium  W\u00f6hlerschule in Frankfurt am Main, he started in 1884 to study electrical engineering at the technical universities in Darmstadt and Berlin. The following year he switched to physics at the University of Berlin which was more to his liking. After just one semester there he transferred to Strasbourg. There he benefited much from the lectures by August Kundt who in 1888 took over the vacant position of Hermann Helmholtz at the University of Berlin. Rubens followed after and got his doctors degree there the same year. In the period 1890\u20131896 he was employed as an assistant at the physics institute and made his habilitation in 1892. He was then a privatdozent and was allowed to teach. Already then he was praised for his experimental investigations of infrared radiation.\nRubens got a permanent position in 1896 as docent at the Technical University of Berlin in Berlin-Charlottenburg. He could continue his experimental research at the nearby Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt. It was there he in 1900 did his important measurements of black-body radiation which made him world-famous. He was promoted to professor the same year.\nAfter Paul Drude retired in 1906 from his professorship at the University in Berlin, the position was given to Rubens. He was at the same time appointed director of the physics institute. In this way he could influence and lead a large group of colleagues and students.

He is considered the most influential artist of the Flemish Baroque tradition. Rubens's highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, colour, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the Counter-Reformation. Rubens was a painter producing altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and history paintings of mythological and allegorical subjects. He was also a prolific designer of cartoons for the Flemish tapestry workshops and of frontispieces for the publishers in Antwerp.\nHe was born and raised in Germany, to parents who were refugees from Antwerp in the Duchy of Brabant in the Southern Netherlands (modern-day Belgium), returning to Antwerp at about 12.  In addition to running a large workshop in Antwerp that produced paintings popular with nobility and art collectors throughout Europe, Rubens was a classically educated humanist scholar and diplomat who was knighted by both Philip IV of Spain and Charles I of England. Rubens was a prolific artist. The catalogue of his works by Michael Jaff\u00e9 lists 1,403 pieces, excluding numerous copies made in his workshop.His commissioned works were mostly history paintings, which included religious and mythological subjects, and hunt scenes. He painted portraits, especially of friends, and self-portraits, and in later life painted several landscapes. Rubens designed tapestries and prints, as well as his own house. He also oversaw the ephemeral decorations of the royal entry into Antwerp by the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria in 1635. He wrote a book with illustrations of the palaces in Genoa, which was published in 1622 as Palazzi di Genova. The book was influential in spreading the Genoese palace style in Northern Europe.

Officials suggested that elections would be held in November 2016, but on 29 September 2016, the nation's electoral authority announced that the election would not be held until early 2018. Talk focused on the need for a census before holding elections. In August 2018, Kabila announced that he would step down and not seek reelection in the December 2018 general election. He was succeeded by F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi in the country's first peaceful transition of power since independence. Independent observers felt Tshisikedi had lost heavily to another candidate, Martin Fayulu, and that Kabila had fixed the official result for the candidate most likely to be most helpful to him in the latter's post-presidency period. While in power, Joseph Kabila faced continuous wars in eastern Congo and internal rebel forces supported by the neighboring governments of Uganda and Rwanda. \nIn 2021, it was reported that Kabila embezzled over $138 million during his presidency.", "hasanswer": true}]}

In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father, thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628, he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. \nDespite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas.\nHale sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676.\nHale's published works were particularly influential in the development of English common law. His Historia Placitorum Coron\u00e6, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \"of the highest authority\", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \"appeal to reason\" and John Selden's \"appeal to contract\", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. Hale wrote that a man could not be charged with marital rape, and that view was widely held until the 1990s. However, he eliminated the previous rape defence that existed in English law for an unmarried man cohabiting with a woman.\nModern scholars also offer criticism of Hale for his execution of at least two women for witchcraft in the Bury St Edmunds witch trials and his belief that capital punishment should extend to those as young as fourteen.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_20414", "text": "In March 1768 he returned to America.

Similarly, John Campbell in his Lives of the Chief Justices of England, wrote that Hale was \"one of the most pure, the most pious, the most independent, and the most learned\" of judges.In 1908, Henry Flanders, described Hale in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, during his lifetime as \"the most learned, the most able, the most honorable man to be found in the profession of the law\".Hale's writings have been cited by the US Supreme Court on numerous occasions. Justice Harry Blackmun cited Hale in \"Roe v. Wade\". Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer in \"Kahler v. Kansas\". In 2022, Hale's opinion on abortion was cited by Samuel Alito in his opinion of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, generating political controversy.In 1993, in the case of R v Kingston, the Court of Appeal relied on his statement that \"drunkenness is not a defence\" to uphold a conviction. William Holdsworth argued in 1923 that it was his learning in Roman law and jurisprudence which allowed him to work so effectively; because he had seen other legal systems at work, he \"could both criticise the defects of English law and state its rules in a more orderly form than they had ever been stated before\". Hale's political neutrality and personal integrity has been attributed by Berman in 1994 to his Puritanism, and his support of the common law; \"Regimes come and go, the common law abides...For Hale...legal continuity was vital for civic identity\".Hale has frequently been compared with Edward Coke. Campbell considered Hale to be the superior lawyer, because while he failed to engage in public life he treated law as a science, and maintained judicial independence and neutrality. In 2002, Hostettler said, while considering Hale a better lawyer than Coke and more influential, that Coke was better overall. While Hale was in possession of judicial impartiality, and his written works are considered highly important, his lack of venture into public affairs limited his progressive influence. Coke's active intervention allowed him to \"breath new life into medieval law and use it to oppose conciliar justice\", encouraging judges to be more independent and \"unfettered except by the common law whose supremacy it was their duty to uphold\".J.H. Corbett, wrote in the Alberta Law Quarterly in 1942, that with Hale's popularity at the time (Parliamentary constituencies \"fought over the privilege of returning him\") he could have been just as successful as Coke if he had chosen to take an active role in public affairs.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He attended the University of North Carolina from which he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude in 1947. After a year working in Indiana, Florida and New York City, he went to Harvard University where he received an MA in English Literature.\nIn 1949, he taught as a Fulbright Scholar in Versailles, France. From 1950 to 1951 he was an assistant professor and taught at Heidelberg University. From 1952 to 1954, he was a member of the Iowa Writer's Workshop and received a PhD from the University of Iowa in 1954. After a year teaching at Connecticut College in New London, he came to the University of Chicago where he taught from 1955 to 2002. He retired as Helen A Regenstein Professor of English and American Literature in 2004.\nDuring his tenure at the University of Chicago, Stern was allegedly involved in the \"suppression\" of the \"beat edition\" of the Chicago Review (winter edition of 1958). At the time the Chicago Review was a student/faculty literary publication published by the University of Chicago. The editor then was Irving Rosenthal. The \"beat edition\" of the Review was to include excerpts from Naked Lunch, by William S. Burroughs, and a few Jack Kerouac stories. According to Rosenthal, Stern, along with Joshua Taylor, another faculty member, wanted to suppress the winter issue, being himself \"so quick to protect the administration.\" (For reference to the case of censorship See The Beats, A Literary Reference, by Matt Theado, pp. 103, 104, 105, under the chapter titled \"The Chicago Review and a Case of Censorship.\")\nStern's own account of the \"so-called suppression\" appeared in \"How I Think I Got to Think the Way I Think\" in The Republic of Letters (reprinted in Still on Call, Stern's  \"orderly miscellany\"). It recounts Stern's successful attempt not only to save the review (the University President at the time, Lawrence A. Kimpton, wished to stop funding the journal) but to keep the following issue from dropping any of the pieces (of Naked Lunch and other \"beat\" works) that had been accepted. Rosenthal and Paul Carroll, the Review's co- editors, founded Big Table, using submissions which Stern and the other student editors claimed belonged to the Review. (Oddly, Stern was invited to and did read at a fund-raiser for Big Table and published what he read in its second issue.)  Furthermore, the previous issue of the Review included an excerpt from Naked Lunch along with work by other Beats.\nIn 1960, Stern published his first novel, Golk,  then the novels Europe or Up and Down with Baggish and Schreiber (1961), In Any Case (1962), Stitch (1965), Other Men's Daughters (1973), Natural Shocks (1978), A Father's Words (1986), and Pacific Tremors (2001). There also have been short story collections culminating in his collected stories, Almonds to Zhoof published in 2004, his 21st book. Of this last book, a reviewer in the New Republic called Stern \"the best American author of whom you have never heard.\" This indeed has been the tag associated with Mr. Stern for the last quarter of a century. \"I was a has-been before I'd been a been,\" was a well-known self-deprecation as was the word of Richard Schickel that Mr. Stern \"was almost famous for not being famous\". Stern published another collection of essays, What is What Was, in 2002.  Like his other essay collections, this one demonstrates that his astute observations in fiction are equal to, and derived from, his acute views on news and culture.\nIn 1985, Stern received the Medal of Merit for the Novel, awarded to a novelist every six years by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Among his many other awards was the Heartland Award for the best work of non-fiction which Stern received for his memoir, Sistermony, published in 1995. Stern has been praised by many of the great writers and critics of the last fifty years, among them Anthony Burgess, Flannery O'Connor, Howard Nemerov, Thomas Berger, Hugh Kenner, Sven Birkerts, and Richard Ellmann, as well as his close friends Tom Rogers, Saul Bellow, Donald Justice, and Philip Roth (see Stern's essay \"Glimpse, Encounter, Acquaintance, Friendship\" in Sewanee Review, Winter 2009).  He also enjoyed literary acquaintances and friendships with such figures as Samuel Beckett, Ezra Pound, Robert Lowell, Lillian Hellman, and Jorge Luis Borges.  Some of Stern's students at the University of Chicago went on to become distinguished writers themselves such as Douglas Unger, Robert Coover, Austin Wright, Campbell McGrath, Peter LaSalle, and Alane Rollings, as well as the well-known journalists Seymour Hersh, David Brooks and Mike Taibbi.\nAt 80, Stern continued to write, and his books remain in print through Northwestern University Press and University of Chicago Press.  From 2006 onwards he maintained a blog with The New Republic.\nThe most recent book about Stern and his work was published in 2001: The Writings of Richard Stern: The Education of an Intellectual Everyman, by David Garrett Izzo (McFarland Publishing).

Issai Schur conducted a seminar and posed a problem in 1921 that Alfred and Richard worked on together, and published a result. The problem also was solved by Heinz Hopf at the same time.

Brauer and Nathan Jacobson edited Weyl's lectures Structure and Representation of Continuous Groups. Through the influence of Emmy Noether, Brauer was invited to University of Toronto to take up a faculty position. With his graduate student Cecil J. Nesbitt he developed modular representation theory, published in 1937.  Robert Steinberg, Stephen Arthur Jennings, and Ralph Stanton were also Brauer\u2019s students in Toronto. Brauer also conducted international research with Tadasi Nakayama on representations of algebras. In 1941 University of Wisconsin hosted visiting professor Brauer.

She was assisted by experts at the University of Washington, the National Research Council Rehabilitation Technology Unit and the Microcomputer Application Program at the Hugh MacMillan Centre.\nThis project began while Treviranus was under contract as a tutor at McMaster University in the Faculty of Health Sciences to integrate 12 students with disabilities into McMaster in compliance with Bill 82, the Ontario Education Act by the Education Amendment Act, 1980, which states that \"the responsibility of school boards to provide (or to agree with another board to provide) in accordance with the regulations, special education programs and special education services for their exceptional pupils\". The McMaster experience \"was a pivotal moment for Treviranus and inspired her work with people with disabilities (PWDs) and in the field of Inclusive Design\".In 1994, Treviranus founded the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC) at the University of Toronto. Her first major research project was in collaboration with SoftQuad and Yuri Rubinsky, funded by Canarie. The goal of the project was to embed accessibility support, in the form of an on-screen \"visual dynamic keyboard\" that offered various text-entry methods, into HoTMeTaL, an early HTML editor. This in part, with Mike Paciello's help, led to the formation of the Web Accessibility Initiative of the W3C.Treviranus moved the ATRC to OCAD University in 2010 and rebranded it as the IDRC. \"She has played a leading role in developing accessibility legislation, standards and specifications internationally (including WAI ATAG, IMS AccessForAll, ISO 24751, and AODA Information and Communication)\".In 2000, Treviranus was a chief expert witness in Maguire v SOCOG 2000, an Australian human rights case regarding the inaccessibility of the Sydney Olympics.  Bruce Maguire won the case leading to changes in accessibility requirements at international games. As a result of this case, the Australian government made the decision to require its agencies to employ W3C guidelines.In 2007, Treviranus was an expert witness in the Donna Jodhan Canadian Supreme Court case whose verdict compelled the Canadian Government to make all of its websites accessible.As the founder of the IDRC and the IDI, one of the areas that Treviranus focuses her efforts on is making the internet accessible through research on assistive tools such as screen readers, touch pads and joysticks.  Treviranus\u2019s research has been used by the Government of Ontario Diversity Office as well as by the United Nations to create disability policy such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

He was appointed bishop of Cahors in March 1679 but served only briefly before Pope Innocent XI ordered him transferred in 1680 to head the diocese of Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne, which made him a peer of France.  On 19 August 1695, in recognition of Noailles's family connections, King Louis XIV made him archbishop of Paris and Duke of Saint-Cloud, and in 1700 Pope Innocent XII made him a cardinal.According to Antoine Degert, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia, although Noailles was not brilliant, \"he was possessed of piety, zeal, and activity.\" He is noted for having raised money to feed famine victims by selling his silver tableware in 1709, and for having spent a considerable part of his inheritance on redecorating Notre Dame.\nNoailles was a friend of Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon, with whom he had studied at the Coll\u00e8ge du Plessis before entering the Sorbonne.  Nonetheless, he was among the bishops who condemned F\u00e9nelon's Maximes des Saints, ending the theologian's career.\nNoailles came to know the controversial young Lutheran Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf in 1719 during the young man's Grand Tour.  The two found great spiritual connection despite their historic denominational differences.  They maintained a relationship and correspondence the rest of Noailles' life; and Noailles became a member of Zinzendorf's Order of the Grain of Mustard Seed, a secret society where nobles and church leaders committed to work together to build the spiritual Kingdom of God. The Cardinal also served as Godfather to Zinzendorf's son Christian Renatus (1727\u20131756).\nNoailles acted as a staunch moralist when at the end of March 1719 he firmly stood behind the cur\u00e9 of Saint-Sulpice. who refused to administer the sacraments to the Regent's daughter, Louise \u00c9lisabeth, Duchess of Berry, who was in a critical condition giving birth to an illegitimate child in the Palais de Luxembourg. Despite all the pleas of the Regent, Philip II, Duke of Orleans, Noailles refused categorically to overturn the decision of the parish priest.Noailles had a complex relationship with the Jansenists; while he condemned their propositions, more orthodox theologians saw in his own teachings hints of Jansenism, and Noailles was an opponent of the Jesuits in their attacks on the sect.  His position on Pope Clement XI's 1713 bull Unigenitus was also controversial; he opposed it, despite papal disapproval, up to 1728 but then abruptly reversed himself shortly before his death.\nHe was succeeded as archbishop of Paris and Duke of Saint-Cloud by Charles-Gaspard-Guillaume de Vintimille du Luc.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_3293", "text": "Louis Antoine de Noailles, Cardinal de Noailles (27 May 1651 \u2013 4 May 1729), second son of Anne de Noailles, 1st Duke of Noailles, was a French bishop and cardinal.

He was ordained deacon in 1902 and priest in 1903, was dean and tutor of Emmanuel College from 1903 to 1907, then senior tutor and chaplain of the college from 1907 to 1921.\nIn 1915, he was interviewed for a commission as a Temporary Chaplain to the Forces. His lack of parochial experience counted against him, and he was thought to be 'slow in movement'. After a second interview in January, 1916, he was appointed and posted to France. He could speak French and had already spent a year there working in a YMCA hut. He was attached to the Guards Division. 'Head was accepted from the start (by the Guards) ... Head, however, who might have been expected to be handicapped from the start as a Cambridge don, was an outstanding success. He was as successful with the officers in a lecture on Napoleon as he was with the men singing 'Tommy Tickler's Jar.\nBy the time of his demobilisation in 1919, Head was Senior Chaplain to the Guards Division and the holder of a Military Cross and Bar. There is a citation for the Bar, 'For most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during operations lasting for several days, when he was continually in the front line accompanying an attack, and by his splendid example inspired the men on all occasions, whilst his attention to wounded and dying men were performed under continuous and heavy fire of all descriptions. His behaviour was the admiration of the whole division' In October, 1918, the Deputy Chaplain-General described him as 'First Rate ... in every way'. His apparent 'slowness in movement' and lack of parochial experience did not, as was feared, handicap his excellent wartime service.\nHe was vicar of Christ Church, East Greenwich from 1922 to 1926, chaplain to King George V from 1922 to 1929, and canon and sub-dean of Liverpool Cathedral from 1926 to 1929.Head was considered for bishoprics in England during the 1920s, particularly Peterborough in 1923, but he had not impressed Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury who wrote to the Prime Minister that Head 'was not in what I should regard as the first rank of men of power and leadership' In September 1929 he accepted the archbishopric of Melbourne, was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 1 November 1929, and enthroned in St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, on 23 December 1929.\nIn Melbourne, Head soon made himself acquainted with the various parishes and clergy. He found a diocese that already had many commitments in connexion with church schools and social work, and the financial depression which began just about the time of his arrival made a strong forward policy inopportune. He interested himself in the question of the re-union of the Christian churches, and in the holding together of his own diocese by preaching peace and goodwill to all, and setting a personal example of plain living and high thinking. At one period he voluntarily gave up a quarter of his stipend, and refused to countenance any expenditure which might lighten his own burden of work. If it was possible to help a parish by attending some function or service he made it his duty to be there, and his relations with his clergy were of the friendliest. From 1933 he was chaplain general to the Commonwealth military forces. Tactful, unassuming, and modest, scholarly and hard-working, much interested in social questions, Head was a steady influence for good in Melbourne. On 7 December 1941 he was driving his car to a confirmation service and ran into a post; he died from his injuries on 18 December 1941. His ashes are interred in St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne.

He became a corporate lawyer with Sullivan & Cromwell, but found work at the large firm stifling, and left for a smaller practice. He resided in Brooklyn, where he was a trustee of the public library and of the Long Island College of Medicine.In 1938 he was appointed by New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia to the Board of Higher Education, replacing Arthur M. Howe. La Guardia reappointed him for a second term, of nine years, in 1940. By the following year, he was chairman of the conduct committee for the Board, and was elected chairman of the administrative committee of Brooklyn College. His Board of Higher Education duties included leading the investigation for the Rapp-Coudert Committee into the extent of communist influence within the public schools.He resigned his Board of Higher Education position in 1942 to enter the Army as a major. Later that year, he was assigned by the U.S. War Department to be a defense lawyer for eight Nazi saboteurs involved in Operation Pastorius. President Roosevelt had directed that the saboteurs be tried via a military tribunal; Lauson's designated role for the defense was to research whether this was constitutionally permissible. Lauson believed there was a strong possibility that a military trial was unconstitutional, and therefore the defense sought a Supreme Court order declaring as much. With the matter set to come before the Supreme Court as Ex parte Quirin, there was a question as to whether Lauson's father, Chief Justice Harlan Stone, would recuse himself from the case due to his son's involvement with the defense. Harlan did offer to do so, but his recusal was declined by Attorney General Francis Biddle, ostensibly because Lauson's involvement had been limited to the military tribunal, and he had been excused from the matters that were coming before the Supreme Court. Legal scholars have questioned this distinction, citing it as one example among many potential conflicts of interest produced by the case's unique circumstances.In 1944, at age 41, Lauson was promoted to the rank of colonel, and he was later discharged at that rank, after being awarded the Legion of Merit Medal.

Except for the summer of 1920 when he studied at University of Freiburg, he studied in Berlin, being awarded his PhD on 16 March 1926. Issai Schur conducted a seminar and posed a problem in 1921 that Alfred and Richard worked on together, and published a result. The problem also was solved by Heinz Hopf at the same time. Richard wrote his thesis under Schur, providing an algebraic approach to irreducible, continuous, finite-dimensional representations of real orthogonal (rotation) groups.\nIlse Karger also studied mathematics at the University of Berlin; she and Brauer were married 17 September 1925. Their sons George Ulrich (born 1927) and Fred Gunther (born 1932) also became mathematicians. Brauer began his teaching career in K\u00f6nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) working as Konrad Knopp\u2019s assistant. Brauer expounded central division algebras over a perfect field while in K\u00f6nigsberg; the isomorphism classes of such algebras form the elements of the Brauer group he introduced.\nWhen the Nazi Party took over in 1933, the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars took action to help Brauer and other Jewish scientists. Brauer was offered an assistant professorship at University of Kentucky. Brauer accepted the offer, and by the end of 1933 he was in Lexington, Kentucky, teaching in English. Ilse followed the next year with George and Fred; brother Alfred made it to the United States in 1939, but their sister Alice was killed in the Holocaust.Hermann Weyl invited Brauer to assist him at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study in 1934. Brauer and Nathan Jacobson edited Weyl's lectures Structure and Representation of Continuous Groups. Through the influence of Emmy Noether, Brauer was invited to University of Toronto to take up a faculty position. With his graduate student Cecil J. Nesbitt he developed modular representation theory, published in 1937.  Robert Steinberg, Stephen Arthur Jennings, and Ralph Stanton were also Brauer\u2019s students in Toronto. Brauer also conducted international research with Tadasi Nakayama on representations of algebras. In 1941 University of Wisconsin hosted visiting professor Brauer. The following year he visited the Institute for Advanced Study and Bloomington, Indiana where Emil Artin was teaching.\nIn 1948, Brauer moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan where he and Robert M.

The first retrospective of his work, which ended in March 2008, was assembled at MASS MoCA in North Adams, MA. He currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nFinch produces work in a wide variety of mediums, including watercolor, photography, glass, electronics, video and fluorescent lights. He is perhaps best known for dealing with the elusive concepts of memory and perception through light installations. After measuring with a colorimeter the light that exist naturally in a specific place and time, Finch re-constructs the luminosity of the location through artificial means. For example, Moonlight (Luna County, New Mexico, July 13, 2003), replicates the exact light of the full moon that shone over the desert of Luna County, New Mexico on the evening of July 13, 2003.Creative Time, Friends of the High Line, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation commissioned The River That Flows Both Ways to Spencer Finch as the inaugural art installation for the High Line Park. The work is integrated into the window bays of the former Nabisco Factory loading dock, as a series of 700 purple and grey colored glass panes. Each color is exactly calibrated to match the center pixel of 700 digital pictures, one taken every minute, of the Hudson River, therefore presenting an extended portrait of the river that gives the work its name.  Creative Time worked with the artist to realize the site-specific concept that emerged when he saw the rusted, disused mullions of the old factory, which metal and glass specialists Jaroff Design helped to prepare and reinstall.Finch was chosen to create the only work of art commissioned for the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.

She was born in New York on 11 November 1979, and spent her childhood in Indonesia, America and the UK. She graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art, London, in 2003 and completed her postgraduate degree at Royal Academy of Arts in 2006. In the same year, she was awarded the prestigious Deutsche Bank Award in Fine Art. Highly regarded for her site-specific work in the public realm, she has since undertaken commissions that include the Folkestone Triennial (2017), Songdo Tech City (2016), Liverpool Biennial (2012), The Southbank Centre (2008), and TFL Art on the Underground (2007). She held the inaugural Bridget Riley Fellowship 2016\u201317 at the British School at Rome, is the recipient of the British Council's International Development Award and was shortlisted for the Jerwood Painting Prize. She lives and works between London and Bali.\nTantra's practice is diverse, ranging from painted canvases, to site-specific sculptural interventions, to large-scale public artworks. She describes her work as 'painting on an architectural scale'. Colour is central to her practice, as a 'material which lies between the language of art and industry'. Her distinctive palette is inspired by her Balinese heritage and childhood holidays: 'I remember things through colour \u2013  especially the way in which colours vibrate against each other. I like the idea of \u2018colour semiotics\u2019 and the associations one has to particular colours in relationship to either brand or narrative.'Her work has been described as \"exuberant\", a \"hedonistic celebration of excess and decoration\", and her contribution to public art by transforming spaces with \"chaotic yet captivating images\" has been recognised by collectors and commissioners alike. Her 2010 work Universe of Objects in Archive, Arsenic and Railings praised for lifting the perspective \"like the energy of a released spring and pulses horizontally around the room in endless optical trigonometric fugue\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "69_3475", "text": "Tantra was born on 11 November 1979, in New York, to Balinese parents. Her father worked in finance, while her mother looked after her and her four older siblings. When Tantra was aged 6, the family relocated to the UK. Tantra has said, 'Like many first generation children whose parents migrated, I could never really identify with being from just one particular place. My work explores my identity and the layering of cultures specific to my own experiences. I am inspired by the colours of Bali, an English Heritage palette and 1980s pop Americana.'\nAfter completing a BTEC diploma in Fine Art at Middlesex University in 1999, Tantra took her BA at the Slade School of Fine Art from 2000 to 2003, under the tutor Andrew Stahl, head of Painting. It was here that she met the sculptor Nick Hornby, who she would go on to collaborate with in the future. \nDuring her studies, Tantra was introduced to the work of the conceptual artist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), whose reduction of painting to a 'series of instructions or blueprints' she cites as a \u2018huge\u2019 and enduring influence on her practice. Like LeWitt, Tantra's work lies at the intersection between art and architecture, exceeding the confines of the canvas and of the gallery space. Likewise, Tantra cites the Indonesian painter Mochtar Apin (1923-1944) as an inspiration: 'In my work, there are specific elements inspired by Indonesian patterns. These patterns are reduced, distorted or enlarged to such a scale that the viewer becomes submerged in the decoration itself.'After graduating, Tantra was accepted onto the Royal Academy Fine Art Masters Programme. Her studies were funded by a Paul Smith Postgraduate Scholarship. It was at the RA that Tantra's interest in large-scale artwork in the public realm began. She regards this as a reaction both to the stereotype of female work as modest or decorative. 'Even at art school, painting on canvas didn't really appeal to me- I was more interested in playing with architectural space, injecting colour, line, and form into new environments. Admittedly in the early days, there was also the desire to challenge the gender stereotype, that both men and women could make large scale works.'

Hess was so impressed with the 15-year-old Norton's playing that she arranged for Norton to study in England in 1923 with Hess's own mentor, the famed pedagogue Tobias Matthay, with whom Norton would remain in association for 8 years.\nMrs. Norton made her first appearance within that same year with the Queen\u2019s Hall Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Sir Henry Wood, who subsequently took Norton on tour as soloist throughout the provinces. She played many recitals at that time in Wigmore Hall, and was soloist with the Manchester, Birmingham, and B.B.C.

In the United States, she made her formal debut at Carnegie Hall and later premiered many new works at frequent concert appearances at Town Hall. She was invited by Koussevitzsky to play with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and was heard from coast to coast as recitalist and soloist with the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, and Chicago symphonies under Dobrowen, Verbrugghen, Stokowski, Ormandy, Stock, Reiner, and Steinberg. One highlight from this period was her premiere\nperformance and recording with RCA Victor of Hindemith's Kammermusik No. 2, with Stokowski conducting.\nAn important milestone occurred in Mrs. Norton's development when she heard Artur Schnabel's performances of Beethoven's piano sonatas in 1932.

His education was at the Crypt Grammar School from where he went to the Cathedral Grammar School, and later was apprenticed to a Dr Buchanan of Gloucester. His uncle, Daniel Ellis, a member of the Royal Society Edinburgh, suggested that he enrol as a medical student at the newly founded University College London. In his vacations he studied in Paris and attended lectures and worked at anatomy in Berlin.\nEllis was Demonstrator of Anatomy under Professor Richard Quain, and succeeded him in the Chair of Anatomy in 1850, retiring as Emeritus Professor in 1877, but always aloof from the professional world. He was succeeded by Sir George Dancer Thane (1850-1930). Ellis was one of the great names of the world of anatomy in England, having given all his working life to the study and teaching of this discipline, and was held in the highest respect. His lectures were conscientiously precise and lucid, so that his students always paid close attention.\nIn 1840 he published \"Demonstrations of Anatomy: being a Guide to the Knowledge of the Human Body by Dissections\", his name becoming a household word among medical students, and his work becoming the standard textbook in England and the United States. The 11th edition of his book was published in 1890.\nUniversity College London in its first thirty-five years of existence, published an extraordinary number of anatomical atlases. Ellis carried on this tradition by collaborating with the South African natural history illustrator, George Henry Ford, to produce some of the best anatomical artwork ever published. They used the relatively new technique of chromolithography for their imperial folio atlas of fifty-eight plates, \"Illustrations of Dissections in a Series of Original Coloured Plates the Size of Life\". The plates were done between 1863 and 1867, with from four to seven completed each year. These plates are considered exceptionally clear and accurate, with an aesthetic depiction of the cadavers, printed by Mintern Bros., and published by James Walton.During Ellis' tenure the University College London was regarded as the pre-eminent centre for the study of anatomy, its spacious and well-lit dissecting room approved of by both staff and students. The College was fortunate in acquiring and retaining the services of an anatomist of Ellis' stature - his culture, zeal, and energy were legendary - receiving only a moderate salary and with no prospect of career improvement. In Ellis' day cadavers were not treated with any preservatives, so that they were often in an advanced state of putrefaction, limiting dissection to the winter months. Several times he acted as Examiner in Anatomy at the University of London, but declined to join the Court of Examiners of the Royal College of Surgeons.\nOn his retirement Ellis came into a small fortune left him by a relative, built himself a house at Minsterworth, 'Severn Bank', and lived there quietly with his younger sister, devoting himself to gardening and apple-growing. He also ran night classes for the older boys of the parish.

She then traveled to Paris in 1902 to continue her studies at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian where she was the first woman to be awarded the Concours Julian-Smith in 1904.On her return to the United States, she began to earn commissions mainly for her meticulous illustrations in magazines and books, like those she drew for Helen Hay Whitney's book of poems, entitled Herbs and Apples (1910). In San Antonio, Texas, she helped form the San Antonio Conversation Society in 1924.  In 1926 she met Diego Rivera. As Rivera was finishing his mural project at the Ministry of Education in Mexico City, Mrs. Van Horn joined him and other artists in the production of the work.  Rivera painted her face in one of the murals on the third floor of the building.For four years (1928\u20131932), she and her husband lived in Berkeley, California where she joined various art leagues and worked with prominent artists in the Bay Area, including John Emmett Gerrity, David Park and Galka Scheyer who represented The Blue Four:  European abstractionists, Feininger, Kandinsky, Jawlensky and Klee. She also became a member of the San Francisco Art Association and the Society of Women Artist, won several notable awards, and was included in a major international retrospective at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco as one of thirty-five American artists.During a trip to Mexico is 1926, Van Horn met and befriended Diego Rivera. He was working on a mural for the Ministry of Education in Mexico city at the time. During her time in Mexico, Van Horn was greatly influenced by Rivera which led to a major transformation in her work. Her subject matter became mostly native peasant women, pictured in an outside setting and much more simplified than her earlier works.She returned to Berkeley in 1941 after her husband died. She contacted an old Berkeley colleague, Marjorie Eaton who lived in Palo Alto on the Juana Briones Ranch, owned by Ms. Eaton's mother. There she spent the last twenty-eight years of her life. \nMrs. Van Horn's life was peripatetic and at times difficult.  Her mother died when she was three, and shortly after moved from her family's sugar plantation on the Mississippi River to New Orleans.  When she fourteen, she went to live in Washington, D.C., with her socially and politically involved aunt and uncle, Martha and Herbert Wadsworth.\nIn Washington she met Douglas MacArthur, who fell in love with her, as evidenced by a recently discovered cache of letters written to her by him. Around the same time she met her husband Robert Osborn Van Horn; they were married in 1908. Van Horn was also a military officer who subsequently served under MacArthur during the First World War and retired as a brigadier general in 1940.\nDuring her married years, Van Horn lived in many places: Cuba, Georgia, Kansas, Texas, and California. She and her husband had two daughters: Margaret born in 1909 and Lucretia in 1916. When Margaret contracted tuberculosis and died in 1932, Van Horn, devastated by the loss, left her family for some time.  It is not clear where she went or for how long.\nVan Horn's artistic evolution went through at least three distinctive phases.  Her early illustrations reflect her attraction to the work of Maxfield Parrish, her work of the late 1920s and 1930s are patterned on the images of Diego Rivera, and her later work was influenced by the European abstractionists, most especially her favorite, Paul Klee.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "106_38090", "text": "Horn was born in England to a Ugandan mother and father from the United States, and grew up in Lesotho and Fiji.

He made his first trip to the Minnesota-Ontario border lakes in 1906.\nIn 1909 he took his first extended canoe voyage through the border lakes and the Rainy Lake watershed, traveling 3,000 miles that summer.  During the period from 1908 to 1915, Oberholtzer wrote a number of articles and short stories, some under the penname Ernest Carliowa.  Many of the stories and articles were based on his canoe trip experiences.  In 1913, Oberholtzer moved to Rainy Lake.  He purchased Mallard Island in 1922; the tiny island would be his home for more than 50 years.\nAfter plans were announced by business mogul Edward Backus to construct a series of dams to harness the Rainy Lake watershed for power generation, Oberholtzer spoke in opposition at a hearing of the International Joint Commission held at International Falls in September 1925.  As a result of meetings with Minneapolis businessmen who were similarly opposed to industrialization of the area, the Quetico-Superior Council was formed in 1928.  Oberholtzer served as its first president.  His activities for the council included lobbying United States Congress and the Minnesota legislature, testifying before the International Joint Commission and building public support for the council's program.  In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the President's Quetico-Superior Committee to advise and coordinate government activity concerning the Quetico-Superior area.

{"id": "69_471", "question": "Where was John Berryman educated?", "ctxs": [{"id": "69_3947", "text": "John Berryman was born on October 25, 1914, in McAlester, Oklahoma, where he was raised until the age of ten, when his father, John Smith, a banker, and his mother, Martha (also known as Peggy), a schoolteacher, moved to Florida. In 1926, in Clearwater, Florida, when Berryman was 11 years old, his father shot and killed himself. Smith was jobless at the time, and he and Martha were filing for divorce. Berryman was haunted by his father's death for the rest of his life and wrote about his struggle to come to terms with it in much of his poetry.\nIn \"Dream Song #143\", he wrote, \"That mad drive [to commit suicide] wiped out my childhood. I put him down/while all the same on forty years I love him/stashed in Oklahoma/besides his brother Will\". In \"Dream Song #145\", he also wrote of his father: \n\nSimilarly, in Dream Song #384, Berryman wrote:\n\nAfter his father's death at the rear entrance to Kipling Arms, where the Smiths rented an apartment, the poet's mother, within months, married John Angus McAlpin Berryman in New York City. The poet was renamed John Allyn McAlpin Berryman. Berryman's mother also changed her first name from Peggy to Jill. Although his stepfather later divorced his mother, Berryman and his stepfather stayed on good terms. With both his mother and stepfather working, his mother decided to send him to the South Kent School, a private boarding school in Connecticut. Berryman then attended Columbia College, where he was president of the Philolexian Society, joined the Boar's Head Society, edited The Columbia Review, and studied under the literary scholar and poet Mark Van Doren. Berryman later credited Van Doren with sparking his interest in writing poetry seriously. For two years, Berryman also studied overseas at Clare College, Cambridge, on a Kellett Fellowship from Columbia. He graduated in 1936.\nBerryman's early work formed part of a volume titled Five Young American Poets, published by New Directions in 1940. One of the other young poets included in the book was Randall Jarrell.\nBerryman published some of this early verse in his first book, Poems, in 1942. His first mature collection of poems, The Dispossessed, appeared six years later, published by William Sloane Associates. The book received largely negative reviews from poets like Jarrell, who wrote, in The Nation, that Berryman was \"a complicated, nervous, and intelligent [poet]\" whose work was too derivative of W. B. Yeats. Berryman later concurred with this assessment of his early work, saying, \"I didn't want to be like Yeats; I wanted to be Yeats.\"In October 1942, Berryman married Eileen Mulligan (later Simpson) in a ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral, with Van Doren as his best man. The couple moved to Beacon Hill, and Berryman lectured at Harvard. The marriage ended in 1953 (the divorce was formalized in 1956), when Simpson finally grew weary of Berryman's affairs and acting as \"net-holder\" during his self-destructive personal crises. Simpson memorialized her time with Berryman and his circle in her 1982 book Poets in Their Youth.In 1947, Berryman started an affair with a married woman named Chris Haynes, documented in a long sonnet sequence that he refrained from publishing in part because that would have revealed the affair to his wife. He eventually published the work, Berryman's Sonnets, in 1967. It includes over one hundred sonnets.In 1950, Berryman published a biography of the fiction writer and poet Stephen Crane, whom he greatly admired. The book was followed by his next significant poem, Homage to Mistress Bradstreet (1956), which featured illustrations by the artist Ben Shahn and was Berryman's first poem to receive \"national attention\" and a positive response from critics. Edmund Wilson wrote that it was \"the most distinguished long poem by an American since T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land.\" When Homage to Mistress Bradstreet and Other Poems was published in 1959, the poet Conrad Aiken praised the book's shorter poems, which he found superior to \"Homage to Mistress Bradstreet\".Despite his third book of verse's relative success, Berryman's great poetic breakthrough occurred with 77 Dream Songs (1964). It won the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for poetry and solidified Berryman's standing as one of the most important poets of the post-World War II generation that included Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, and Delmore Schwartz. Soon thereafter, the press began to give Berryman a great deal of attention, as did arts organizations and even the White House, which sent him an invitation to dine with President Lyndon B. Johnson (though Berryman declined because he was in Ireland at the time). Berryman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1967, and that same year Life magazine ran a feature story on him. Also that year the newly created National Endowment for the Arts awarded him a $10,000 grant (when a Minneapolis reporter asked him about the award, he said that he had never heard of NEA before receiving it).Berryman also continued to work on the \"dream song\" poems at a feverish pace and in 1968 published a second, significantly longer, volume, His Toy, His Dream, His Rest, which won the National Book Award for Poetry and the Bollingen Prize. The next year Berryman republished 77 Dreams Songs and His Toy, His Dream, His Rest as one book, The Dream Songs, in which the character Henry serves as Berryman's alter ego. In Love & Fame (1970), he dropped the mask of Henry to write more plainly about his life. Responses to the poems from critics and most of Berryman's peers ranged from tepid to hostile; the collection is now generally \"considered a minor work\". Henry reappeared in a couple of poems published in Delusions Etc. (1972), Berryman's last collection, which focused on his religious concerns and spiritual rebirth. The book was published posthumously and, like Love & Fame, is considered a minor work.Berryman taught or lectured at a number of universities, including the University of Iowa (at the Writer's Workshop), Harvard University, Princeton University, the University of Cincinnati, and the University of Minnesota, where he spent most of his career, except for his sabbatical year in 1962\u20133, when he taught at Brown University. Some of his illustrious students included W. D. Snodgrass, William Dickey, Donald Justice, Philip Levine, Robert Dana, Jane Cooper, Donald Finkel, and Henri Coulette. In a 2009 interview, Levine said Berryman took his class extremely seriously and that \"he was entrancing ... magnetic and inspiring and very hard on [his students'] work ... [and] he was [also] the best teacher that I ever had\".

Three years later he obtained his degree of associate professor in animal husbandry.

There were no children. Mrs Sutherland became a friend of Florence Nightingale, and assisted her with practical matters, when he became Nightingale's closest collaborator. Mrs Sutherland shared their concerns about public health; she was an active member of the Ladies' Sanitary Association.\nAfter spending much time on the continent he practised for a short period in Liverpool, where he edited 'The Liverpool Health of Towns' Advocate' in 1846. In 1848, at the request of the Earl of Carlisle, he entered the public service as an inspector under the first board of health. He conducted several special inquiries, notably one into the cholera epidemic of 1848\u20139 (Parl. Papers, 1850 No. 1273, 1852 No. 1523). He was the head of a commission sent to foreign countries to inquire into the law and practice of burial.

Louis Napoleon conferred him the Order of the Legion of Honour for services in producing a new International Sanitary Regulation.\nIn 1855 he was engaged at the Home Office in bringing into operation the act for abolishing intramural interments (ib. 1856, No. 146).

This commission's mandate was not only to investigate but to implement changes. It started work in March 1855 on the worst Scutari hospitals and succeeded in bringing down the death rates. With Sutherland was a leading civil engineer, Robert Rawlinson, and members of the pioneering Sanitary Department at Liverpool, who did the cleaning out of the sewers and drains.  \nOn 25 August 1855 he came to England for consultation, and was summoned to Balmoral to inform the Queen of the steps that had been taken for the benefit of the troops.\nAfter the war he and Nightingale, with many others, tried to get the planned Royal Victoria Hospital at Netley cancelled (it was drastically redesigned). He and Nightingale jointly produced a confidential report on it for the war secretary.He took an active part in the preparation of the report of the royal commission on the health of the army dated 1858 (ib. 1857\u201358, No. 2318), and also of the report on the state of the army in India, dated 19 May 1863 (ib. 1863, No. 3184). Both reports were of vast importance to the welfare of the soldiers, and most of Sutherland's recommendations were carried out. One of these was the appointment of the barrack and hospital improvement commission, with Sidney Herbert as president and Captain (afterwards Sir) Douglas Galton, Dr. Burrell of the army medical department, and Sutherland as members. This committee visited every barrack and hospital in the United Kingdom, and the sanitary arrangements of each were reported on. Defects were brought to light and remedied, and the health of the troops consequently improved (ib. 1861, No. 2839). Subsequently, Dr. Sutherland and Captain Galton visited and made reports on the Mediterranean stations, including the Ionian Islands (ib. 1863, No. 3207).\nAs a member of the Royal Commission on the Crimean War, Sutherland worked up the considerable amount of evidence for it. He also gave his own evidence to it. He then became the \"active member\" of the four sub-commissions set up within the War Office, after the Crimean War, to ensure that the recommendations of the Royal Commission were implemented. Further, again according to Nightingale, not only was he a member of the Royal Commission on India, he \"wrote nearly the whole\" of the report on it. That work benefited as well as the British Army, \"the whole native population\u2014all that has been done for them sprang from this commission\".In 1862 the barrack and hospital improvement commission was reconstituted with the quartermaster-general as president and Sutherland as a prominent member. The title was altered to the army sanitary committee in 1865 (ib. 1865, No. 424). Two Indian officers were added, and all sanitary reports were submitted to the committee and suggestions for improving Indian stations prepared. This arrangement remained in force until Sutherland's retirement on 30 June 1888, when he was appointed a medical superintending inspector-general of the board of health and home office.\nNightingale considered that Dr Sutherland received so little recognition for his work: no honours from the UK, although the French gave him the Legion of Honour.\nNightingale and Sutherland formed an effective public health reform team. They shared a common philosophy, of the application of the best available science, to be applied to the problem at hand, then ongoing monitoring to ensure that the results were beneficial. Sutherland acted sometimes as Nightingale\u2019s research assistant, finding crucial material for her\u2014he was a doctor and well connected internationally with public health and military experts. Sometimes he was her secretary, reading correspondence and drafting replies for her. They shared a Christian faith and ambitious, faith-based, goals for reform. Sutherland drafted some of Nightingale\u2019s boldest statements about quality hospital care being available to the poorest\u2014as good as that received by private patients.\nSutherland continued his beneficent work to within a few years of his death, which took place at Oakleigh, Alleyne Park, Norwood, Surrey, on 14 July 1891. Sutherland\u2019s last words to his wife were for Nightingale: \u201cGive her my love and my blessing\u201d.

He was born in Fort McIntosh, Texas, where his father, a West Point graduate and career military officer originally from Allegan, Michigan, was stationed at the time. His parents met while his father was stationed at Fort Union, New Mexico, as his mother's family was from nearby rural Mora County, New Mexico. He spent his early childhood growing up on military posts in New Mexico and Texas, where his father was stationed until the family finally moved back to his father's native Allegan, Michigan in 1888. He was the fourth-oldest of eight brothers, five of whom played football for the University of Michigan, and one sister. Three of the brothers earned varsity letters in football, and the oldest of those three brothers, Alanson Weeks (September 15, 1877 \u2013 November 25, 1947), played halfback for the 1898 Michigan team that won the school's first Western Conference championship. His eldest brother, Frank Russel Weeks (March 21, 1876 \u2013 March 2, 1947), instead became a soldier like their father and later a civil servant working for the US Treasury Department.\nBoss Weeks enrolled at Michigan in 1899 and played on the school's \"scrub team\" as a freshman. As a sophomore, Weeks made the varsity football team where he was the backup quarterback to Edwin McGinnis. In 1901, a new era in Michigan football began as Fielding H. Yost was hired as the school's new football coach. Yost immediately taught Weeks and the Michigan team a new, lightning-fast offense. Under the new scheme, Weeks would call the signals for the next play without a huddle, sometimes while he was \"still under the pile from the previous play.\" If a player was too slow getting line up for the next play, Yost would yell from the sideline, \"Are you a spectator? Hurry up! Hurry up!\"\nWeeks started all 11 games at quarterback for the 1901 Michigan Wolverines and had tremendous success with Yost's new system. In the early days of football when Weeks played, the quarterback was the true field general, as there were no communications with the bench, and the quarterback had the responsibility to call the plays on both offense and defense. The 1901 team led by Weeks went undefeated and scored 550 points, earning the team the nickname, \"Point-a-Minute.\" The 1901 team was equally strong on defense, not allowing a single point to be scored through the entire season, and not allowing another team to make a gain of more than 15 yards on a single play. Michigan was invited to play in the first Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California, on January 1, 1902, where they defeated Stanford, 49\u20130.\nThe following June, the Michigan team elected Weeks as the captain of the 1902 team. Weeks led the 1902 team to another 11\u20130 record, and the team increased its offensive scoring output to an unprecedented 644 points. The team scored 119 points against Michigan Agricultural and 107 points against Iowa. The only minor blemish on the record of the 1902 team was that, after not allowing opponents to score a single point in 1901, the defense gave up a total of 12 points in 11 games.Some consider the 1901 and 1902 \"Point-a-Minute\" teams to be the greatest teams in Michigan Wolverines football history. Looking back in 1930, Fielding Yost said of Weeks: \"Michigan had one outstanding leader: Boss Weeks, quarterback of the first two teams I coached here. Weeks was the leader without reproach. He drove two Michigan teams to a total of 1,211 points against 12. Had he told either team to charge a stone wall, it would have done so, I believe, so much did the teams believe in him.\"In addition to his talent at football, Weeks was reported to have been \"a clever student,\" a member of the Delta Chi fraternity, and one of the most popular students on the campus.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "26_49379", "text": "Chung accepted a teaching fellowship at the John F.

After finishing elementary school, Margita enrolled in the Josip Slavenski Music High School from which she graduated as the most talented pianist in her class alongside Ivo Pogoreli\u0107. Her impressive school performance led to an offer of further studies at the famed Moscow Conservatory, which she ended up turning down due to family reasons\u2014her mother very much disliked the idea of letting her go to Moscow by herself at such a young age. Instead, Margita enrolled at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Architecture where she was no less successful. Throughout her architecture studies she still continued practicing the piano as well as playing and occasionally touring with various small orchestras.\nAfter graduating university in 1982, along with her then-boyfriend Sr\u0111an Vejvoda, the older brother of Goran Vejvoda, she began to take an interest in Belgrade's underground music scene, which struck her as a completely different lifestyle from the one she was used to. During the spring of 1982, she was introduced to Milan Mladenovi\u0107 by her cousin Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107. Soon thereafter, at one of Katarina II's early rehearsals, she got an offer to join the band. After returning from a three-month trip to South America, she decided to take the still-standing offer, joining Katarina II in late 1982.\nMargita was Katarina II/Ekatarina Velika's member until its very end in late 1994. During her time with the band, she also collaborated on the albums of many other Yugoslav bands such as Karlowy Vary produced by Tomo in der M\u00fchlen, Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107 & His Meteors, Van Gogh, Babe etc.\nShe composed the score for several TV films (Prvi put s ocem na jutrenje, Vera Hofmanova, Povratak Vuka Alimpi\u0107a, Plavi plavi) and theatre productions (Klasni neprijatelj, Tri sestre). In 1985, she was introduced as an actress (the role of Dragana) in the movie Taiwan Canasta directed by Goran Markovi\u0107.\nAfter Milan's death and Ekatarina Velika's end, Magi continued her work as a musician. During 1994\u201395 she played in a band called Kurajberi, which gathered several Belgrade musicians and was focused mainly on performing covers at club gigs and jam sessions. In 1995, with a group of young Belgrade musicians involved in a techno movement, she formed a band called EQV and released an album Ti si sav moj bol named after the famous Ekatarina Velika song off S' vetrom uz lice, the album itself containing a techno version of the same song. The album was published by the Austrian label Coop Arts & Crafts Unlimited. In October of the same year, EQV participated in Tactic Festival in Vienna. She further continued contributing as a guest star on albums and concerts of many Serbian bands and occasionally played with bands the Glissers, Zion Banda and Direktori. Magi played keyboards in Belgrade's band the Glissers in 1995 and 1996. They performed on a weekly basis and released a CD The Glissers Vol. 1 for IMAGO Records. She also designed the cover for it. In 2019, it was re-released by Yugovinyl and BIVECO as an album in vinyl form under the title The Glissers. \nIn 1996, she played several unplugged concerts with Elektri\u010dni Orgazam, one of which was recorded and released the same year by B92 as \u017divo i akusti\u010dno. During that time, she was also involved in several significant music projects (S one strane duge, Pesme iznad Istoka i Zapada). In December 1998, she became the first rock artist from Serbia to perform in Croatia following the Yugoslav Wars.Sometime in 1996, Stefanovi\u0107 became a member of Ars Antibari writers society from Bar, which published several of her stories in two books (Izgleda da \u0107e jugo, Bar, 1996; and Da li da ti ka\u017eem ko te je ubio, Gea?, Belgrade, 1999). In 2002, she composed the music for the theatre play Kaput mrtvog \u010doveka directed by Hajdana Baleti\u0107, which turned out to be Stefanovi\u0107's last music-related work.\nHowever, from 1996 onwards her life was mostly spent struggling with heroin addiction and the physical effects of long-term drug use. Following the passing of her father in February 1996, Stefanovi\u0107's drug problems intensified. In order to support her addiction, she sold pretty much all of her possessions including an apartment in Vra\u010dar. She used part of the money for a trip to India, and also to buy two smaller apartments in Zvezdara and \u010cubura. Not long thereafter she sold those as well and eventually ended up living in a ramshackle modified garage in the suburb of Bor\u010da. By this time she was basically penniless, depending on charity and handouts for even the basics such as food.Margita Stefanovi\u0107 spent the last months of her life living in a homeless shelter in Vo\u017edovac.

In 1919 she joined the Bolsheviks in Odesa. Kukharchuk fluently spoke French, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian as well as her native Lemko dialect and she became one of the leaders of the Young Communist League in Odesa, then occupied by the French. Kukharchuk and Taras Franko, the son of Ivan Franko, then joined the Galician party bureau, created at the order of Vladimir Lenin to spread Communist ideas among the Ukrainian Galician Army.

During the 1880s while at St. Petersburg University Oldenburg participated in the Scientific-Literary Association of Students, a brotherhood which shared liberal and radical ideals. Here he met Aleksandr Ulyanov as they were both in the inner circle of this organisation. Ulyanov dropped out of the inner circle when he started to plan an assassination attempt on the life of emperor Alexander III.

Based on his acquaintance with Vladimir Lenin, he was able to develop an alliance between the Bolsheviks and Russian ethnographers, the former being more interested in nationalism amongst European peoples of the former Russian Empire, the ethnographers focusing more on the national question amongst its Asian peoples.Although he was briefly imprisoned by the Cheka in 1919, Oldenburg served as permanent secretary of the Academy of Sciences until 1929, when the Communist Party ousted hundreds of staff for resisting Bolshevization.

After stages in Moscow (1992 \u2013 1996) and Brussels (1996 \u2013 1998), she has been making her home in Cologne and is working as a freelance writer.\nIn her novel Emmas Gl\u00fcck (Emma\u2019s Bliss) of 2003, translated into nine languages, she included motifs from her hometown in northern Hesse. It has been her most successful work so far. With its crisp and witty sentences, its deadpan presentation of the improbable and eccentric and its deep sympathy for its cast of misfits, Schreiber's style in this book somewhat recalls that of Heinrich B\u00f6ll.

The novel recounts the heroine's struggle to liberate herself from her pervading relationship with God, who constantly appears to her and with whom she converses familiarly. A Dutch translation of this book appeared in 2007.\nHer latest novel S\u00fc\u00df wie Schattenmorellen (Sweet as Morello Cherries) is a coming-of-age-story, most of it taking place in a cherry orchard.

According to research [1] published by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Gompert was educated at Adelphi Academy,\nPratt Institute, and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. The Landmarks Commission report on Gompert was included in its study of its decision to grant landmark status to the building that once housed The High School of Music & Art. It states:\n\"After employment in the firms of McKim, Mead & White, Maynicke & Franke, and George Edward Harding & Gooch, he established his own practice around 1906 and specialized in the design of commercial and institutional buildings. He was elected president of the Brooklyn chapter of the\nAmerican Institute of Architects in 1923. Gompert was hired in February 1923 by the New York City Board of Education as an expert to assist in the reorganization of the Bureau of Construction and Maintenance and to facilitate the construction of public schools; his initial six-month contract gave him the 'powers and duties of Superintendent of School Buildings.'\n\"According to The New York Times, Gompert had 'much experience in the directing of large building construction enterprises.' After a six-month extension of his contract, Gompert was appointed in January 1924 to the position of Architect and Superintendent of School Buildings for the Board of Education, and became the third-highest paid official in the administration of Mayor John Francis Hylan.\n\"Gompert was the first successor to the noted Charles B.J. Snyder, Superintendent of School Buildings from 1891 until January 1, 1923, who had been responsible for the vast school construction program following the consolidation of New York City in 1898, and had been 'virtually forced out of the post under pressure by. . . Mayor Hylan.'\n\"To alleviate the serious overcrowding in the schools caused by immigration after World War I,\nNew York City undertook another extensive program of school construction in the mid-1920s. Gompert was forced to contend with a significant shortage of bricklayers in the citywide building industry, as well as a lack of interest on the part of major construction firms in bidding on public\nschool construction projects. He attempted to bring about economy and change in the process of school construction, including standardizing design and construction, employing general contracts instead of individual construction contracts, and instituting double shifts to shorten construction time. In 1925, however, charges began to surface, first by a mayoral candidate, that many of the schools constructed under Gompert were defective. By the end of 1927, three separate investigations were underway and Gompert resigned in December. Former Mayor Hylan responded to critics that\nGompert was under attack because he had 'built too many schools to suit those that do not want the\nchildren educated.'\n\"The Board of Education's Joint Committee of Architects and Engineers issued\nits report in 1928 and called Gompert's schools 'in general honest, safe, efficient and appropriate to the purpose.'\n\"In his nearly five years as school architect,Gompert was credited with overseeing the design\nand construction of some 170 new schools and\nadditions, including The High School of Music & Art (in 1924), DeWitt Clinton High School and Theodore Roosevelt High School (1929), the Bronx; James Madison High School (1926), Brooklyn; and\nJamaica High School (1927) and Far Rockaway High School (1929), Queens, in austere versions of\nsuch contemporary institutional styles as Collegiate Gothic, Georgian, and Spanish Colonial.

As foreign secretary in the Lloyd George ministry, he issued the Balfour Declaration of 1917 on behalf of the cabinet, which supported a \"home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine.Entering Parliament in 1874, Balfour achieved prominence as Chief Secretary for Ireland, in which position he suppressed agrarian unrest whilst taking measures against absentee landlords. He opposed Irish Home Rule, saying there could be no half-way house between Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom or becoming independent. From 1891 he led the Conservative Party in the House of Commons, serving under his uncle, Lord Salisbury, whose government won large majorities in 1895 and 1900. An esteemed debater, he was bored by the mundane tasks of party management.\nIn July 1902, he succeeded his uncle as prime minister. In domestic policy he passed the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903, which bought out most of the Anglo-Irish land owners. The Education Act 1902 had a major long-term impact in modernising the school system in England and Wales and provided financial support for schools operated by the Church of England and by the Catholic Church. Nonconformists were outraged and mobilised their voters, but were unable to reverse it. In foreign and defence policy, he oversaw reform of British defence policy and supported Jackie Fisher's naval innovations. He secured the Entente Cordiale with France, an alliance that ended centuries of intermittent conflict between the two states and their predecessors. He cautiously embraced imperial preference as championed by Joseph Chamberlain, but resignations from the Cabinet over the abandonment of free trade left his party divided. He also suffered from public anger at the later stages of the Boer War (counter-insurgency warfare characterised as \"methods of barbarism\") and the importation of Chinese labour to South Africa (\"Chinese slavery\"). He resigned as prime minister in December 1905 and the following month the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 election, in which he lost his own seat. He soon re-entered Parliament and continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition throughout the crisis over Lloyd George's 1909 budget, the narrow loss of two further General Elections in 1910, and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911. He resigned as party leader in 1911.\nBalfour returned as First Lord of the Admiralty in Asquith's Coalition Government (1915\u20131916). In December 1916, he became foreign secretary in David Lloyd George's coalition. He was frequently left out of the inner workings of foreign policy, although the Balfour Declaration on a Jewish homeland bore his name. He continued to serve in senior positions throughout the 1920s, and died in 1930, aged 81, having spent a vast inherited fortune. He never married. Balfour trained as a philosopher \u2013 he originated an argument against believing that human reason could determine truth \u2013 and was seen as having a detached attitude to life, epitomised by a remark attributed to him: \"Nothing matters very much and few things matter at all\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

His father Simkha Leibovich (also known as Semyon Lvovich) was a banker and his mother was Tsetsilia Moiseevna.Vygotsky was raised in the city of Gomel, where he was homeschooled until 1911 and then obtained a formal degree with distinction in a private Jewish gymnasium, which allowed him entrance to a university. In 1913, Vygotsky was admitted to the Moscow University by mere ballot through a \"Jewish Lottery\": at the time a three percent Jewish student quota was administered for entry in Moscow and Saint Petersburg universities. He had an interest in the humanities and social sciences, but at the insistence of his parents he applied to the medical school at Moscow University. During the first semester of study, he transferred to the law school. In parallel, he attended lectures at Shanyavsky Moscow City People's University.

After the Congress, Vygotsky met with Alexander Luria and with his help received an invitation to become a research fellow at the Psychological Institute in Moscow which was under the direction of Konstantin Kornilov.

His dissertation was accepted as the prerequisite of a scholarly degree, which was awarded to Vygotsky in autumn 1925 in absentia.\nAfter his release from the hospital, Vygotsky did theoretical and methodological work on the crisis in psychology, but never finished the draft of the manuscript and interrupted his work on it around mid-1927. The manuscript was published later with notable editorial interventions and distortions in 1982 and was presented by the editors as one of the most important of Vygotsky's works. In this early manuscript, Vygotsky argued for the formation of a general psychology that could unite the naturalist objectivist strands of psychological science with the more philosophical approaches of Marxist orientation. However, he also harshly criticized those of his colleagues who attempted to build a \"Marxist Psychology\" as an alternative to the naturalist and philosophical schools. He argued that if one wanted to build a truly Marxist Psychology, there were no shortcuts to be found by merely looking for applicable quotes in the writings of Marx. Rather one should look for a methodology that was in accordance with the Marxian spirit.From 1926 to 1930, Vygotsky worked on a research program investigating the development of higher psychological functions, i.e. culturally governed lower psychological functions such as voluntary attention, selective memory, object-oriented action, and decision making. During this period he gathered a group of collaborators including Alexander Luria, Boris Varshava, Alexei Leontiev, Leonid Zankov, and several others. Vygotsky guided his students in researching this phenomenon from three different perspectives: \n\nThe instrumental approach, which aimed to understand the ways humans use objects as mediation aids in memory and reasoning.\nA developmental approach, focused on how children acquire higher cognitive functions during development\nA culture-historical approach, studying how social and cultural patterns of interaction shape forms of mediation and developmental trajectories Vygotsky died of a relapse of tuberculosis on June 11, 1934, at the age of 37, in Moscow. One of Vygotsky's last private notebook entries was:\n\nThis is the final thing I have done in psychology \u2013 and I will like Moses die at the summit, having glimpsed the promised land but without setting foot on it. Farewell, dear creations. The rest is silence.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_4673", "text": "Vygotsky was a pioneering psychologist with interests in extremely diverse fields: his work covered topics such as the origin and the psychology of art, development of higher mental functions, philosophy of science and the methodology of psychological research, the relation between learning and human development, concept formation, interrelation between language and thought development, play as a psychological phenomenon, learning disabilities, and abnormal human development (aka defectology). His philosophical framework includes interpretations of the cognitive role of mediation tools, as well as the re-interpretation of well-known concepts in psychology such as internalization of knowledge. Vygotsky introduced the notion of zone of proximal development, a metaphor capable of describing the potential of human cognitive development.\nHis most important and widely known contribution is his theory for the development of \"higher psychological functions,\" which emerge through unification of interpersonal connections and actions taken within a given socio-cultural environment (i.e. language, culture, society, and tool-use). It was during this period that he identified the play of young children as their \"leading activity\", which he understood to be the main source of preschoolers' psychological development, and which he viewed as an expression of an inseparable unity of emotional, volitional, and cognitive development. At this time, Vygotsky explored his long-time interest in the philosophy of Spinoza's examinations concerning human emotion. As his work matured, Spinoza's thought became a more central visitation in Vygotsky's later work, increasingly focused on the issue of human emotion and its role in higher psychological functions and development.\nWhile Vygotsky never met Jean Piaget, he had read a number of his works and agreed on some of his perspectives on learning. At some point (around 1929\u201330), Vygotsky came to disagree with Piaget's understanding of learning and development, and held a different theoretical position from Piaget on the topic of inner speech; Piaget thought that egocentric speech follows from inner speech and \"dissolved away\" as children matured. Vygotsky showed that egocentric speech became inner speech, and then called \"thoughts\". Piaget only read Vygotsky's work after his death and openly praised him for his discovery of the social origin of children's thoughts, reasoning, and moral judgements.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_4670", "text": "Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky (Russian: \u041b\u0435\u0432 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0451\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u044b\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, [v\u0268\u02c8\u0261otsk\u02b2\u026aj]; Belarusian: \u041b\u0435\u045e \u0421\u044f\u043c\u0451\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0456\u0447 \u0412\u044b\u0433\u043e\u0446\u043a\u0456; November 17 [O.S.

The first edition appeared in 1686, the second, enlarged, in 1691, and it has been frequently reprinted since. It was commended for general use as a textbook by its method, its conciseness, and its absence of mere polemics. It was obviously, however, intended by its author as a vindication of the Jena theology, which had been sharply attacked from Wittenberg, and lay under some suspicion of syncretism. Its dependence upon Mus\u00e6us is really the distinguishing feature of the book, which is largely a compilation from him. Baier\u2019s other works include polemical writings against Erbermann, a convert to Roman Catholicism and a Jesuit, and against the Quakers; and three other\ncompendiums, published after his death (1698), one of exegetical, and one of moral theology, as well as one of the history of dogma.

Brumfield is currently Professor of Slavic studies at Tulane University.\nBrumfield grew up in the deep American South, where he became interested in Russia by reading Russian novels. After receiving a BA from Tulane University in 1966 and an MA from the University of California, Berkeley in 1968, he arrived in the former Soviet Union for the first time in 1970 as a graduate student starting work in architectural photography, although he did not seriously study the craft of photography until 1974. Brumfield earned a Ph.D in Slavic studies at the University of California, Berkeley in 1973 and held a position of assistant professor at Harvard University in 1974\u20131980.In 1983 Brumfield, formerly a generalist of Slavic studies, established himself in the history of architecture with his first book, Gold in azure: one thousand years of Russian architecture. It was followed by The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture (1991), Russian housing in the modern age: design and social history (1993), A History of Russian Architecture (1993, Notable Book of that year and a best seller\naccording to The New York Times), Lost Russia: Photographing the Ruins of Russian Architecture (1995), Landmarks of Russian Architecture: A Photographic Survey (1997) and Commerce in Russian urban culture: 1861-1914 (English edition 2001, Russian edition 2000).\nIn 1986 Brumfield organized the first exhibit of photographic prints from the Prokudin-Gorsky Collection at the Library of Congress. Since that time Brumfield has been actively engaged in the study of Prokudin-Gorsky's photographs, including several publications for the site \"Russia Beyond the Headlines\".Brumfield lived in the former Soviet Union and Russia for a total of fifteen years, doing postgraduate research with Moscow State University and Saint Petersburg State University, but mostly travelling through the northern country, surveying and photographing the surviving relics of vernacular architecture. In a 2005 interview Brumfield, asked to tell which of those journeys stood out, picked a photo survey of Varzuga, a remote village connected to civilization by 150 kilometers of a sandy clay track. Brumfield donated a collection of around 1,100 photographs of northern Russian and Siberian architecture taken in 1999\u20132003 to the Library of Congress. Part of his archive was digitized with assistance of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the University of Washington Library. The basic collection of Brumfield's photographic work is held in the Department of Images Collections at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. The William C. Brumfield Collection at the National Gallery of Art consists of 12,500 black-and-white 8\" x 10\" photographic prints, 40,000  negatives and over 89,000 digital files, most of which are in color (nearly 149,000 in total).In 2000 Brumfield was selected a Guggenheim Fellow for Humanities - Russian History. He has been a full member of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences (RAASN) since 2002 and an honorary fellow of the Russian Academy of the Arts since 2006. He currently holds the record for most domes captured in a single photograph.\nIn 2014 the D. S. Likhachev Foundation in St. Petersburg awarded Brumfield the D. S. Likhachev Prize \"for outstanding contributions to the preservation of the historic and cultural heritage of Russia.\"In 2019 Brumfield was awarded the Order of Friendship, \u201cfor the merits in strengthening friendship and cooperation between peoples, fruitful activities for the rapprochement and mutual enrichment of cultures of nations and nationalities.\u201dIn 2021 Brumfield launched a virtual exhibition entitled \"Lost America,\" which is based on photography done in the United States primarily in the 1970s. These photographs represent an essential part of Brumfield's development as an artist, and they are the basis of an exhibition in July-August 2023 at the A. V. Shchusev State Museum of Architecture, Russia's preeminent museum devoted to the study and documentation of architecture. The project is presented in an accompanying catalogue entitled Lost America.Brumfield's first exhibit at the Shchusev State Museum, \"The Russian North.

In 1966, Will was an English major on a basketball scholarship, in his fourth and final year at the Institute. Will is not interested in a military career, and had only attended on account of his father, also an alumnus. His father died several years before Will started, where he made a promise to eventually wear the Institute's graduate ring. He is generally well-liked and his professors and peers recognize him for his integrity and fairness, although he is also sarcastic and independent. Will struggles to fit into the strict military environment, but finds solace in his three roommates, who have become his closest friends: Tradd St. Croix, the son of an upper-class Charlestonian family, and two brawny Italian-American boys from the North, Dante \"Pig\" Pignetti and Mark Santoro. They all look forward to graduation, although Will's friends will head off to fight in the Vietnam War, which Will is personally against. However, Will does have some pride in the Institute, representing it in basketball. Though anti-war, he also despises the discrimination the Institute faces from civilian students of other colleges due to its military association, which he sees at away games. For example, when Will plays a game against the Virginia Military Institute, which is considered their biggest rival game, he notes that VMI was the only team all season that did not harass him and his teammates. \nRetired U.S. Army officer Colonel Thomas \"The Bear\" Berrineau, the Commandant of Cadets, asks Will to look out for the Institute's first black cadet, Tom Pearce, knowing that Will is the only cadet unopposed to racial integration. Will also begins a secret relationship with Annie Kate Gervais, a girl from an upper-class Charlestonian family who has become pregnant from a boy who refused to marry her, though their relationship is doomed because Will is Irish-American, Catholic, and not wealthy. Will attempts to aid a struggling freshman, Poteete, who has been targeted by numerous upperclassmen. Shamed by his inability to cope with the harshness of the Institute's freshman system, Poteete hangs himself, leaving behind his ominous claim of a \"house where they take freshmen\" to be tormented outside the oversight of the Commandant's office.\nIn an extended flashback, Will then describes his own plebe year three years earlier. Will learns that the only way to survive is to bond closely with the other members of his class against the cadre. Having entered the college on a basketball scholarship, Will is also protected by other members of the basketball team who don't want to see Will physically harmed and, at one point, rescue him from a particularly brutal hazing incident. Many of Will's classmates are not so lucky, and resign from the school due to the unrelenting hazing. \nOne recruit swiftly rises to prominence: Bobby Bentley, who has a problem with urinating on himself due to the stress of hazing but is otherwise in excellent shape. Bentley refuses to quit on himself or his classmates, and endures all the torments the upperclassmen can devise. Conventional hazing methods fail to break Bentley and his classmates gradually rally around him, and making Will's cadre the subject of ridicule of the entire corps of cadets. One evening, Bobby Bentley is taken off campus by unknown individuals and withdraws from the Institute the following day for unknown reasons. A first classman claims that a secret society of cadets had been watching Bobby Bentley and, once it became clear the R Company cadre had failed to run Bentley out of the school, The Ten had decided to act. Near the end of the year, Will's freshman class is recognized as cadets, and the hazing ends. Will vows to himself that he will never participate in tormenting future generations of plebes, seeing no value in organized cruelty.\nBack in Will's senior year, he hears new rumors of The Ten, a mysterious Institute secret society whose members are handpicked for embodying the greatest virtues of the Institute. The Ten ensures certain cadets, deemed unacceptable to \"wear the ring\" (that is, to be a graduate of the Institute, denoted by wearing of a class ring), are run out by any means necessary.   Aided in his investigation by a mentor, a professor in the History department, Will discovers that The Ten are real and are trying to run Pearce out to keep the Institute all white. Meanwhile, Will and the other seniors receive their class rings in a solemn ceremony, and Will wins the final basketball game of his career in quadruple overtime against the Virginia Military Institute.\nAnnie Kate's baby is stillborn and she rejects Will, wanting to forget all about the time she spent pregnant. Will looks further into The Ten and reunites with Bobby Bentley, who reveals that, during their plebe year, he was spirited away to a house, and was threatened, tortured, and finally agreed to quit when The Ten prepared to burn him alive. Bentley says his ultimate decision to quit was not due to the torture, but the realization he no longer wished to be associated with any organization that would have a group like The Ten. Bentley recalls one member of The Ten, whom they piece together as a high-ranking cadet from their plebe year. Will, Mark, and Pig, discovering this Ten member is now a student at a nearby law school, abduct him, then interrogate him on a secluded railroad track until he reveals the location of the house, which is a plantation house owned by General Bentley Durrell, the superintendent of the Institute. When Pearce is kidnapped by the Ten, Will goes to the house and interrupts the torture of Pearce. Pig and Mark arrive to rescue Will as The Ten pursue him, but The Ten now know of the few trying to move against them.\nPearce is intimidated into silence, and The Ten begin a campaign to have Mark, Pig and Will thrown out of the school. Pig is caught on an honor code violation due to The Ten and loses the honor court case, despite Will, Tradd and Mark each speaking in his defense. After he is expelled and drummed out of school, he throws himself in front of a train, killing himself. Will and Mark soon after begin getting demerits for a wide range of offenses, real and fabricated. Just as they are about to be dismissed, Will discovers that Tradd's father was a member of The Ten. He and Mark read his journals and discover the names of all current and former members. They also realize Tradd is the father of Annie Kate's baby, is a member of The Ten in their class, and was thus informing on his roommates from the start. Soon after, Will confronts Tradd and ends their friendship.\nFacing expulsion for excess demerits, Will confronts General Durrell and demands that he and Mark be allowed to graduate. Durrell refuses, citing their extensive list of infractions and the fact that the Institute graduate they kidnapped has contacted him and wants to press charges. The Bear then enters the General's office, informing him that multiple cadets who were run out of the Institute are willing to attest to The Ten's existence and activities in court. General Durrell relents when also faced with the threat of exposure to the press, as evidenced by Mark seen outside with letters containing the information ready to be mailed. Will and Mark are allowed to graduate, but General Durrell's decision to fire Colonel Berrineau as Commandant stands. The General and The Ten survive with their power intact, but forever shaken, as for the first time an opponent has stood against them and won.\nShortly before graduation, Will receives a letter from Annie Kate, thanking him for standing by her and saying he will make a good husband to whatever woman he finds. Reflecting on his graduation, Will notes that eight of his fellow cadets will eventually be killed in action in the Vietnam War, Mark among them. Will also reveals that The Ten member and class \"golden boy\" John Alexander would eventually fade into obscurity, last seen working as a ROTC instructor at a small university, while Mark Santoro tops the entire class in awards for valor.

Guerrier lost both parents as  a small child and was brought up by relations as a Lutheran. He received his secondary education in Moscow at the parish school of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Peter and Paul on Kozmodemyansk Street, now Starosadskiy Lane. In 1854 he entered the historical-philological faculty of the Moscow State University, where he was a student of Granovsky. Upon completing this course, he was retained by the university to prepare for a professorship, and at the same time he became a teacher of literature and history to the first Moscow Cadet Corps. In 1862, he defended his master's thesis: The struggle for the Polish throne in 1733, and then travelled abroad, spending three years in Germany, Italy and Paris. In 1865 he was elected a professor in the department of general history at Moscow University and began teaching there. Guerrier was a lifelong friend of the philosopher Vladimir Solovyov.A strong campaigner for the independence of universities, in an article in Vestnik Evropy in 1876, Guerrier expressed the opposition of most Russian university professors in attacking proposals by Liubimov to transplant important features of the German system of university education into Russia. In 1879, Count Dmitry Tolstoy abolished the professors' disciplinary courts, but the subsequent University Statute of 1884 proved unworkable and had to be repealed.Guerrier was not considered an impressive public speaker.

He showed a paternalistic attitude towards women, long after they had shown they could master university-level courses. However, after Tolstoy had refused to give graduates of the courses teaching rights, in 1876 and 1877 Guerrier petitioned the minister to change his mind, arguing that a growing number of unmarried women were without families to support them, so that there was an economic imperative for employment rights for such women.At one point there was controversy about Guerrier among the kursistki, as the female students were known. The cry went up \"Let's catcall Guerrier!\" after it had been alleged that as director of the Higher Courses he had treated women \"like an Oriental despot\".

She was instrumental in the creation of the Canaveral National Seashore in 1975, and the Spruce Creek Preserve, renamed the Doris Leeper Spruce Creek Preserve in memoriam. She founded the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1982. She was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 1999.\nLeeper was born on April 4, 1929, in Charlotte, North Carolina. She attended Duke University, originally intending to become a brain surgeon \u2013 the origin of her nickname \"Doc.\" She eventually graduated in 1951 with a degree in art history.In 1958, while working in the field of commercial art, she moved to the small isolated community of Eldora, Florida, situated on a barrier island between New Smyrna Beach and Titusville, Florida, along Mosquito Lagoon. As a result of her presence there, Leeper became increasingly interested in environmental preservation. By 1961, she had become a full-time artist, specializing in painting and sculpture. Her work is in over 100 collections in the U.S. and abroad.By the early 1970s, Leeper was a well-known figure in the Florida environmental movement, as an advocate for protection of Mosquito Lagoon and opposition to major development on the barrier island around Eldora. She used her growing influence to advocate for the 1975 creation of the Canaveral National Seashore (CANA), which encompassed 58,000 acres including the barrier island and Mosquito Lagoon.  Rep. Lou Frey, one of the sponsors of the Congressional authorization called Leeper \"the driving force behind the establishment of Canaveral National Seashore.\" Afterwards she was appointed to the Canaveral National Seashore Advisory Commission and founded Friends of Canaveral where she pushed for wilderness protection for the seashore.Leeper conceived of the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1977, envisioning it as a Florida artist-in-residence program in which artists of all disciplines could work with current prominent artists in a supportive and creative environment. Leeper saw the potential for an artist's residency as a place for ideas to be created, shared, and come into fruition. She soon persuaded friends and community members to join in her vision. In 1979, she convinced the Rockefeller Foundation to provide a challenge grant that soon was matched. This $25,000 in seed money was the unofficial inception of the ACA. When a prime piece of property became available on the shores of Turnbull Bay, a tidal estuary west of New Smyrna Beach, Leeper raised the $50,000 necessary to buy the ten-acre plot. Three years later, five main buildings were completed. Over the years, five more buildings were constructed and an additional 59 acres were purchased as preserve land.\nThe ACA officially opened in 1982 for the first residency with author James Dickey, sculptor Duane Hanson, and composer David Del Tredici. Since then, over 155 interdisciplinary residencies have taken place, featuring over 430 Master Artists and over 3,500 Associate Artists from around the world.\nBeginning in 1987, Leeper pushed for conservation of lands adjacent to ACA on Turnbull Bay and Spruce Creek. She founded Friends of Spruce Creek Preserve, and actively engaged in the protection of over 2,000 acres of scrub, wetlands, and archaeological sites, now known as Doris Leeper Spruce Creek Preserve.Leeper was awarded honorary doctorates from Duke and from Stetson University. She was named Florida ambassador of the arts, and inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 1999.  A 45-year retrospective of her work was held at Cornell Fine Arts Museum in 1995.When Canaveral National Seashore was established, the National Park Service bought out all of the private property owners in Eldora including Leeper who retained a life estate in her property.  On her death on April 11, 2000, her property, as with the rest of Eldora, formally became part of the national seashore.  Now, only two of its original buildings remain. In 2020, Leeper's house, known as Caper's Acres, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in recognition of her national reputation as an artist and environmental advocate.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "69_3378", "text": "Robers was born in Columbia, South Carolina.
