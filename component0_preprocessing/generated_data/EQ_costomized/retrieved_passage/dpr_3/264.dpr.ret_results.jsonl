The song was written by Shaffer \"Ne-Yo\" Smith, Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel S. Eriksen, Espen Lind, Amund Bj\u00f8rklund, Beyonc\u00e9 and produced by Stargate and Beyonc\u00e9. \"Irreplaceable\" was originally a country record; it was re-arranged as a mid-tempo ballad with pop and R&B influences by modifying the vocal arrangements and instrumentation. During the production and recording sessions, Beyonc\u00e9 and Ne-Yo wanted to create a record which people of either gender could relate to. The song's lyrics are about the breakdown of a relationship with an unfaithful man and the song contains a message about female empowerment.\nFollowing the moderate chart performances of \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" and \"Ring the Alarm\", \"Irreplaceable\" was released internationally on October 23, 2006, as the album's second single, and the third in the United States on December 5, 2006. The single was released through Columbia Records. Pitchfork Media and Rolling Stone placed it on their lists of Best Songs of the 2000s. \"Irreplaceable\" won several awards, including Best R&B/Soul Single at the 2007 Soul Train Music Awards. It was nominated for the Record of the Year award at the 50th Grammy Awards.\nThe single became Beyonc\u00e9's fourth number-one in the U.S., was B'Day's most successful release, and remained at the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for 10 consecutive weeks. \"Irreplaceable\" was the twenty-fifth most successful song of the 2000s (decade) in the U.S., and was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It became Beyonc\u00e9's second single to achieve 200 million audience impressions in 2006. She is the second singer to achieve this feat in the U.S., the first having been Mariah Carey in 2005. \"Irreplaceable\" also peaked at number one in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, and New Zealand, at number four in the United Kingdom, and reached the top ten in several other European countries. \"Irreplaceable\" was the most successful song of 2007 in the US and 2007's tenth best-selling digital single with over 4.6 million copies sold worldwide. It also was the most downloaded female ringtone of the 2000s decade in the US.\nThe single's accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler and served as the debut performance of Beyonc\u00e9's all-female band, Suga Mama. The video was included on the 2007 B'Day Anthology Video Album, and a video edit was produced for \"Irreemplazable\", the Spanish version of the song. It won the Video of the Year award at the 2007 Black Entertainment Television (BET) Awards, and was nominated for the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year at the 2007 Awards. \"Irreplaceable\" has regularly featured in Beyonc\u00e9's tours and live performances since 2006.

Shortly after the release of \"Irreplaceable\", Beyonc\u00e9 told MTV: \"I love 'Irreplaceable'. I think it's important to have those songs. I've had so many people come up to me in tears, saying, 'I experienced my first breakup. If it wasn't for the song, I wouldn't be strong enough to not call. I wouldn't know how much I'm worth.' I'm happy to be a part of that.\"\"Irreplaceable\" was released in the United Kingdom on October 23, 2006, as the second single there. In the US, \"Irreplaceable\" was the third single from B'Day', and followed \"Ring the Alarm\". The single was released on December 5, 2006, and featured the album and instrumental versions of the track. \"Irreplaceable\" was the second single released from B'Day in international markets on Columbia Records. Two versions of the single were released in the UK on October 26, 2006. A CD single, which featured the album version of \"Irreplaceable\", and the Freemasons club mix radio edit of \"Ring the Alarm\", was released. An enhanced CD, which included the album version, three remixes of \"Ring the Alarm\", and the \"Ring the Alarm\" music video, was also released.

Written in the key of B\u266d major, the beat is set in common time and moves at a moderate 88 beats per minute. Beyonc\u00e9's vocal range in the song spans nearly two and a half octaves, from B\u266d2 to E\u266d5. While most of the songs on the album are aggressive and uptempo, her voice on \"Irreplaceable\" is toned down. \"Irreplaceable\" uses a gently strummed acoustic guitar, following the B\u266d5\u2013F5\u2013Cm7\u2013E\u266d6/9 chord series. Hermansen and Eriksen combined the classic chord progression on an acoustic guitar, a modern-sounding 808 drum beat and cellos. Al Shipley of Stylus Magazine noted that the guitar strum can be found in Rihanna's 2007 single \"Hate That I Love You\", a song co-produced by Stargate and Ne-Yo.  Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote that Chris Brown's 2007 single \"With You\", another Stargate-produced song, also features the same element. He wrote, \"'With You' is the convincer, even if you can instantly tell that producer Stargate was just trying to roll out 'Irreplaceable' one more time.\" while Billboard magazine wrote that it \"leans a bit too heavily\" to the song.\n\nJim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that \"Irreplaceable\" resembles ballads sung by Whitney Houston. Spence D. of IGN wrote that the song was inspired by Aretha Franklin's work since \"Irreplaceable\" consists of several variations in gutturals and octave range. The lyrics of \"Irreplaceable\" concern the breakdown of a woman's relationship with her boyfriend after she discovers his infidelity, and the song \"sounds a lot like a statement of independence\". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote, \"With a heretofore unknown grasp of nuance, Beyonce combines heartache, bravado, and anger as she tells a cad he's far from irreplaceable\u2014and that, in fact, her new man will be arriving momentarily.\" Hermansen said that \"Irreplaceable\" is a song that \"people from all walks of life can enjoy\". Beyonc\u00e9 said that the song is \"a little honest\", and, \"... basically we can't forget our power and our worth. And sometimes you're so in love, you forget that. And sometimes you feel like you're not being appreciated. And sometimes they forget that they can be replaced.\"The song's lyrics are constructed in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form. It begins with guitar strumming, and Beyonc\u00e9 sings the hook-intro, \"To the left, to the left: everything you own in a box to the left\". In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing with her boyfriend about the indifference of their relationship, and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus and chorus follow, \"You must not know 'bout me ... I can have another you by tomorrow / I could have another you in a minute ... Don't you ever for a second get to thinking / You're irreplaceable\". In the second verse, Beyonc\u00e9 recollects the moment she discovered her boyfriend's infidelity. The same pattern leads to the second chorus. Towards the end, Beyonc\u00e9 sings the bridge, where she tells her lover, \"Replacing you is so easy\". The song closes with an ad-libbed chorus. The Boston Globe noted that Beyonc\u00e9 sings some parts of it in a higher register \"that complements the lyrics' wounded sensibility\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Records in the US. As a result of the Sex Pistols' volatile internal relationships, the band's lineup saw changes during the recording of the album. Original bass guitarist Glen Matlock left the band early in the recording process, and while he is credited as a co-writer on all but two of the tracks, he only played bass and sang backing vocals on one track, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" Recording sessions continued with a new bass player, Sid Vicious, who is credited on two of the songs written by the band after he joined. While Vicious's bass playing appeared on two tracks, his lack of skill on the instrument meant that many of the tracks were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones playing bass instead. Drummer Paul Cook, Jones and singer Johnny Rotten appear on every track. The various recording sessions were led alternately by Chris Thomas or Bill Price, and sometimes both together, but as the songs on the final albums often combined mixes from different sessions, or were poorly documented who was present in the recording booth at the time, each song is jointly credited to both producers.\nBy the time of its release, the Sex Pistols were already controversial, having spoken profanity on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from playing live in some parts of Britain. The album title added to that controversy, with some people finding the word \"bollocks\" offensive. Many record stores refused to carry it and some record charts refused to list its title, showing just a blank space instead. Due in part to its notoriety, and in spite of many sales bans at major retailers, the album debuted at number one on the UK Album Charts. It achieved advance orders of 125,000 copies after a week of its release and went gold only a few weeks later, on 17 November. It remained a best-seller for nearly a year, spending 48 weeks in the top 75. The album has also been certified platinum by the RIAA. It has seen several reissues, the latest in 2017.\nThe album has influenced many bands and musicians, and the industry in general. In particular, the album's raw energy, and Johnny Rotten's sneering delivery and \"half-singing\", are often considered game changing. It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album, and one of the greatest and most important albums of all time. In 1987, Rolling Stone magazine named the album the second best of the previous 20 years, behind only the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The same magazine ranked it 73rd on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2020. In 2006, it was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest albums ever.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_52721", "text": "Sex Pistols\n\nJohnny Rotten \u2013 lead vocals\nSteve Jones \u2013 guitar, bass on all tracks except for \"Anarchy in the UK\", backing vocals\nPaul Cook \u2013 drums\nGlen Matlock \u2013 bass and backing vocals on \"Anarchy in the UK\"\nSid Vicious \u2013 partial bass on \"Bodies\" and \"God Save the Queen\"Production\n\nChris Thomas \u2013 producer\nBill Price \u2013 engineering, co-production\nJon Walls \u2013 AIR Studios second engineer", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52718", "text": "The album was originally going to be titled God Save Sex Pistols. Jamie Reid's cover concept refrained from including a picture of the group and instead was dayglo red and yellow in colour with cutout lettering and a finish resembling crude screen-prints while the US version was pink with a green Sex Pistols logo. The album's title changed in mid-1977, based on a phrase supplied by Steve Jones. Jones said he picked up the phrase \"Never mind the bollocks\" from two fans who would always say it to one another. Johnny Rotten explained its meaning as a working-class expression to \"stop talking rubbish\".In the United Kingdom, the album was subject to what Heylin described as \"blatant acts of censorship exercised by media and retail outlets alike\". London police visited the city's Virgin record store branches and told them they faced prosecution for indecency as stipulated by the 1899 Indecent Advertisements Act if they continued to display posters of the album cover in their windows. The displays were either toned down or removed. However, on 9 November 1977 (just two days before the album was released in the US), the London Evening Standard announced on its front-page headline \"Police Move in on Punk Disc Shops\", and reported how a Virgin Records shop manager in Nottingham was arrested for displaying the record after being warned to cover up the word \"bollocks\". Chris Seale, the shop's manager, \"it would appear, willingly set himself up as a target, possibly at Branson's behest\", according to Heylin, who noted that he had been visited by the police on four occasions and resumed displaying copies of the record in the store windows after they had left on each occasion. After Seale's arrest, Branson announced that he would cover the manager's legal costs and hired Queen's Counsel John Mortimer as defence. Meanwhile, advertisements for Never Mind the Bollocks appearing in music papers attempted to politicise the issue, showing newspaper headlines about Sex Pistols controversies that were underlined with the message \"THE ALBUM WILL LAST. THE SLEEVE MAY NOT.\"The obscenity case was heard at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 24 November. Mortimer presented the case as a matter of police discrimination. During his cross-examination of the arresting officer, he asked why the newspapers The Guardian and Evening Standard (which had referred to the album's name) had not been charged under the same act. When the overseeing magistrate inquired about his line of questioning, Mortimer stated that a double standard was apparently at play, and that \"bollocks\" was only considered obscene when it appeared on the cover of a Sex Pistols album. The prosecutor conducted his cross-examination \"as if the album itself, and not its lurid visage, was on trial for indecency\", according to Heylin. Mortimer produced an expert witness, Professor James Kinsley, Head of the School of English at the University of Nottingham, who argued that the word \"bollocks\" was not obscene, and was actually a legitimate Old English term formerly used to refer to a priest, and which, in the context of the title, meant \"nonsense\". Lawyer Geoffrey Robertson, who appeared with Mortimer, recalled the professor saying that early English translations of the Bible used \"bollocks\" to refer to testicles, this being replaced by the word \"stones\" in the King James Version of the Bible, at which point Rotten handed Robertson a note saying, \"Don't worry. If we lose the case, we'll retitle the album Never Mind the Stones, Here's the Sex Pistols\". The chairman of the hearing concluded:\n\nMuch as my colleagues and I wholeheartedly deplore the vulgar exploitation of the worst instincts of human nature for the purchases of commercial profits by both you and your company, we must reluctantly find you not guilty of each of the four charges.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The lyrics, which address the value of female friendship over heterosexual relationships, became a symbol of female empowerment and the most emblematic song of the group's girl power philosophy. It was written and recorded quickly. The result was considered lacklustre by their label and was sent to be mixed by Dave Way. The Spice Girls were not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, by Mark \"Spike\" Stent.\n\"Wannabe\" was heavily promoted. Its music video, directed by Johan Camitz, became a success on the British cable network the Box, which sparked press interest in the group. Subsequently, the song had intensive radio airplay across England, while the Spice Girls performed it on television and began doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines.\nResponding to the wave of interest, Virgin released the song as the Spice Girls' debut single in Japan in June 1996 and in the UK the following month, well ahead of the planned release of the Spice album. \"Wannabe\" topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and has received a quadruple platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

There was a period of indecision about what song would be released as the first single; the label wanted to get everything right for the campaign, because the all-girl group format was untested. The group, led by Brown and Halliwell, was adamant that the debut song should be \"Wannabe\", they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and the Girl Power statement. Virgin's executives believed that the first single should either be \"Say You'll Be There\", which they considered a much \"cooler\" track, or \"Love Thing\". At the beginning of 1996 the impasse between the group and their record label about the release of the single was temporarily solved. In March, Fuller announced that he agreed with Virgin in that \"Wannabe\" should not be the first single. The label wanted a song that appealed to the mainstream market, and nothing considered too radical. Halliwell was shocked and furious; she told Fuller, \"It's not negotiable as far as we're concerned. 'Wannabe' is our first single.\" Fuller and the executives at Virgin relented, and the song was chosen as their first single.The trigger for the Spice Girls' launch was the release of the \"Wannabe\" music video in May 1996. Its quick success on the British cable network The Box sparked press interest, despite initial resistance to the all-girl group idea. The same month, their first music press interviews appeared in Music Week, Top of the Pops, and Smash Hits, and their first live TV slot was broadcast on LWT's Surprise Surprise.

He wrote and recorded Airtight's Revenge during a period of approximately three years, working alongside the musician-producers Steve McKie, Nottz, Shafiq Husayn, Conley \"Tone\" Whitfield, and 88-Keys. The album's soul and rock music is more electronic- and guitar-oriented than Bilal's previous albums, featuring influences from jazz, blues, and futurism. Experiences from his personal life and professional conflicts with his former label, Interscope Records, formed the inspiration for the album's dark songwriting, which explores themes of love, spirituality, capitalism, and politics, with lyrics informed by free thought.\nThe album debuted at number 106 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 4,600 copies in its first week. Although it charted modestly, Airtight's Revenge was well received by music critics upon its release.

Just the whole long, drawn-out standstill behind it and how it kind of turned into a phoenix-rising type of deal, with people giving it mad love online and just became this underground type of sensation. So that's the real revenge, the music couldn't be shut down or hidden, but people got it and they loved it, just like I loved making it. That was the meaning behind 'revenge,' and 'Airtight' is just an old nickname that I got.\nBack in the day, I used to really be into reading Donald Goines and Iceberg Slim. I casually read both of their whole catalogs, and they inspired me as a songwriter also, but there's a book Iceberg Slim wrote and the title is Airtight Willie & Me. I kind of kept that name, 'Airtight.' And I think even back then I thought it would be dope to have an album with the title Airtight-something, so Airtight's Revenge sounded like a black exploitation film. It kind of fit the scenario.\nThe album's cover art is a reference to the iconic photo of Malcolm X peering through his window while holding a M1 carbine rifle. Instead of a rifle, Bilal is holding a microphone, and instead of peering through his bedroom curtain, Bilal is peering through a heavy red stage curtain. In an interview with Parlour Magazine, Bilal elaborated on the message behind the album's cover art, stating:\n\nI'm killing them with the words. This album was my version of Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" and a retrospective look on the world and where we are today. There\u2019s not a lot of music like that these days. It almost like some people today have the mental concept of if the world\u2019s going to blow up tomorrow, let\u2019s just get drunk, high and party and if shit blow up, we blow up\u2026  I made a record that was my retrospect on that mentality.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The group comprised vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock.\nOriginally named the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, Led Zeppelin, was a top-ten album in several countries and featured such tracks as \"Good Times Bad Times\", \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Communication Breakdown\". Led Zeppelin II (1969) was their first number-one album, and yielded \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Ramble On\". In 1970, they released Led Zeppelin III which featured \"Immigrant Song\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history with 37 million copies sold. The album includes \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock history. Houses of the Holy (1973) yielded \"The Song Remains the Same\" and \"Over the Hills and Far Away\". Physical Graffiti (1975), a double album, featured \"The Rover\" and \"Kashmir\".\nPage composed most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones's keyboard-based compositions later became central to their music, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included Presence (1976) and In Through the Out Door (1979), grew limited, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death in 1980, feeling that they would not be \"Led Zeppelin\" without him. Since then, the surviving former members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off concerts. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham's son Jason Bonham on drums.\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time; their total record sales are estimated to be between 200 and 300 million units worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US Billboard 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

They were also a founding member of Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth occult group, and fronted the experimental pop rock band Psychic TV.\nBorn in Manchester, P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the avant-garde while at Solihull School. After dropping out of studies at the University of Hull, they moved into a counter-cultural commune in London and adopted Genesis P-Orridge as their pseudonym. On returning to Hull, they founded COUM Transmissions with Cosey Fanni Tutti, and in 1973 they relocated to London. COUM's confrontational performance work, dealing with such subjects as sex work, pornography, serial killers, and occultism, represented a concerted attempt to challenge societal norms and attracted the attention of the national press. COUM's 1976 Prostitution show at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts was particularly vilified by tabloids, gaining them the moniker of the \"wreckers of civilisation.\" P-Orridge's band, Throbbing Gristle, grew out of COUM, and were active from 1975 to 1981 as pioneers in the industrial music genre. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Psychic TV, an experimental band that from 1988 onward came under the increasing influence of acid house.\nIn 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, an informal occult order influenced by chaos magic and experimental music. P-Orridge was seen as the group's leader, but rejected that position, and left the group in 1991. Amid the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, a 1992 Channel 4 documentary accused P-Orridge of sexually abusing children, resulting in a police investigation. P-Orridge was subsequently cleared and Channel 4 retracted their allegation. As a result of the incident, P-Orridge left the United Kingdom for the United States and settled in New York City. There, they married Jacqueline Breyer, later known as Lady Jaye, in 1995, and together they embarked on the Pandrogeny Project, an attempt to unite as a \"pandrogyne\", or single entity, through the use of surgical body modification to physically resemble one another. P-Orridge continued with this project of body modification after Lady Jaye's 2007 death. Although involved in reunions of both Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV in the 2000s, they retired from music to focus on other artistic media in 2009.\nP-Orridge was credited on over 200 releases during their lifetime.

Despite the established commercial success of Thankful, music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an American Idol winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she was convinced by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, in pursuit of a pop rock direction. This also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release. Breakaway is primarily a pop rock record with elements of rock and soul music, marking a departure from the R&B-oriented sound of Thankful; its lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism.\nBreakaway received a positive response from music critics, with many commending the album's new-found pop rock sound and Clarkson's vocal performances. It received several awards and nominations, including winning two Grammy Awards and receiving a nomination for a Juno Award. The album became a commercial success worldwide. By selling over 12 million copies worldwide, Breakaway is Clarkson's best selling album of her career so far, and one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. After debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 in the United States, it stayed on the top twenty of the chart for more than a year, eventually being certified 6\u00d7 multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of more than six million copies.\nBreakaway's singles \"Since U Been Gone\", \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", \"Because of You\", \"Walk Away\", and \"Breakaway\" became worldwide hits and have become some of Clarkson's signature songs. Their successes prompted Billboard to credit her for landscaping the core sound of mainstream pop music as an uptempo dance-oriented sound in the 2000s. Furthermore, Breakaway established Clarkson as one of the four highest-selling acts of Sony BMG in the 2000s. Internationally, the album topped the music charts of Ireland and the Netherlands and became the world's 7th biggest-selling release of 2005, eventually being certified platinum in over 17 countries. To promote the album, Clarkson embarked on three international concert tours from 2005 to 2006: the Breakaway Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and the Addicted Tour.

His distinctive style of piano playing was influenced by learning to play on an instrument that was missing some keys.He began his career in New Orleans in 1948. Mike Tessitore, owner of the Caldonia Club, gave Longhair his stage name. Longhair first recorded in a band called the Shuffling Hungarians in 1949, creating four songs (including the first version of his signature song, \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\") for the Star Talent record label. Union problems curtailed their release, but Longhair's next effort for Mercury Records the same year was a winner.  Throughout the 1950s, he recorded for Atlantic Records, Federal Records and local labels.\nProfessor Longhair had only one national commercial hit, \"Bald Head\", in 1950, under the name Roy Byrd and His Blues Jumpers. He also recorded his favorites, \"Tipitina\" and \"Go to the Mardi Gras\". He lacked crossover appeal among white and wide audiences. Yet, he is regarded (and was acknowledged) as being a musician who was highly influential for other prominent musicians, such as Fats Domino, Allen Toussaint and Dr. John.After suffering a stroke, Professor Longhair recorded \"No Buts \u2013 No Maybes\" in 1957. He re-recorded \"Go to the Mardi Gras\" in 1959. He first recorded \"Big Chief\" with its composer, Earl King, in 1964. In the 1960s, Professor Longhair's career faltered. He became a janitor to support himself and fell into a gambling habit.After a few years during which he disappeared from the music scene, Professor Longhair's musical career finally received \"a well deserved renaissance\" and wide recognition. He was invited to perform at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1971 and at the Newport Jazz Festival and the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1973. His album The London Concert showcases work he did on a visit to the United Kingdom. That significant career resurrection saw the recording of the album Professor Longhair \u2013 Live on the Queen Mary, which was recorded on March 24, 1975, during a private party hosted by Paul McCartney and Linda McCartney on board the retired RMS Queen Mary.By the 1980s his albums, such as Crawfish Fiesta on Alligator Records and New Orleans Piano on Atlantic Records, had become readily available across America. In 1974 he appeared on the PBS series Soundstage (with Dr. John, Earl King, and The Meters). In 1980 he co-starred (with Tuts Washington and Allen Toussaint) in the film documentary Piano Players Rarely Ever Play Together which was produced and directed by filmmaker Stevenson Palfi. That documentary (which aired on public television in 1982 and was rarely seen since), plus a long interview with Fess (which was recorded two days before his sudden death), were included in the 2018 released project \"Fess Up\".Professor Longhair died in his sleep of a heart attack while the filming of the documentary was under way (and before the live concert, which was planned to be its climax). Footage from his funeral was included in the documentary.

They are best known on their native Long Island, although they had some success nationally and internationally.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_53675", "text": "Formed in 1964, the original group consisted of five students from St. John's University in Queens, New York: Ted Haenlein, Frank Stapleton (Frank never plugged in his bass as he did not play it, but it looked good on stage), Eric Crane, Denny Ryan and Peppi Marchello. The group was originally called the U-Men and played most of their gigs in the Rockaways (Peyton Place & McNultys) and Long Island (The Attic, Tiger's Tail etc.)\nIn 1966, Stapleton's brother, John, arranged for the group to play at a club in Queens, New York (The John Doe Room) where a record company executive heard them and eventually signed the band, but suggested a name change was in order. The band continued to play top 40 covers while working on their own original music.\nBy the fall of 1966 the composition of the band had changed with Peppi's brother Micky on guitar, Denny Ryan on drums, Teddy H. on rhythm & singing, and Art Fahie (aka/ Crazy Artie) on bass. The introduction of the \"Rats\" to Long Island's northshore took place at a club called the \"Knotty Knee\", whose owners Jack Dowd & Al Cunningham trusted the group to fill the venue seven-nights per week. A few years later, Marty Ross took ownership of the place under the name \"McDimples\", and for a while everything went on as it had been.  The \"Rats\" were also known for playing \"The Cage\" in Williston Park, as well as \"The Go-Go 7\" in Port Washington. In 1968, \"Teddy\" Haenlein was drafted and went to Vietnam, but did rejoin the group from 1970 to 1972.\nIn 1969, the band released their first album, the self-titled The Good Rats which had cult popularity with New Yorkers local and transplanted when it launched.  Two of its more memorable cuts are the intro song: \"We Are The Good Rats\" where the band members sing the \"hello-hello-hello\" greeting used by the 3 Stooges; and the landmark \"Joey Ferrari\", a proto-punk song (\"Joey Ferrari, though you're from the poor side, don't give you no right to go wild\"). The Good Rats continued to build a following, playing Long Island's thriving club scene, along with other groups, such as Twisted Sister and Zebra. From 1970 until early 1972, the band consisted of Peppi, Mickey, Teddy (guitar) John Argento (bass) and Charlie Zarou (drums). They played weekly at The Baldwin Manor, Back Alley Sallys (of which Peppi and John Argento took on a partnership of the bar). The Rats doing cover tunes, adding originals in, till originals were primarily asked for, during this time songs such as \"Hour Glass\", \"Injun Joe\", \"Mean Mother\", \"Yellow Flower\", were requested by a fan base that continued to grow rapidly. A rare studio recorded LP, recorded and mastered at Echo Studios, East Meadow, was used for shopping the band to record companies.\nIn 1974, the Good Rats released their best-known and most popular album, Tasty. It featured a blend of hard rock and blues, highlighted by Marchello's raspy vocals.  Various songs from this record, including \"Injun Joe\", \"Papa Poppa\", \"Back to My Music\" and \"The Songwriter\", and the blues title track, received airplay around the country on FM radio. During the following years, the Rats performed at venues such as Madison Square Garden, The Philadelphia Spectrum, The Nassau Coliseum, The Hammersmith Odeon in England, and New York's Central Park, as well as showcase rooms such as The Bottom Line (Manhattan), My Father's Place (Roslyn, New York), Whiskey a Go Go (Los Angeles), Casino Arena (Asbury Park, NJ) and The Paradise Room (Boston). They headlined or opened for bands such as Rush, Journey, Kiss, Meat Loaf, Aerosmith, Ozzy Osbourne, The Grateful Dead, Bruce Springsteen, The Allman Brothers Band, Mountain and Styx.Between 1976 and 1980, The Good Rats released a series of albums, including Ratcity in Blue, From Rats to Riches (1978), Birth Comes to Us All, and Live At Last, all of which were well received by the band's fan base, and received some airplay on FM radio.  In 1981, Gatto and Kotke left the band, and were replaced by future Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick and bass player Schuyler Deale (who later played with Billy Joel and Michael Bolton), for the album Great American Music. The band did shows until 1983 and then broke up.\nThroughout the 1980s, Peppi Marchello continued to write and produce recordings with his son Gene. They toured locally for a while under the name \"Popzarocca\" until the song \"First Love\" became a minor hit for Gene's band, Marchello.  Marchello also recorded a music video for \"First Love\", and had received minor airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball. This band featured Gene on guitar and lead vocals, drummer John Miceli (Meat Loaf, Rainbow, and bassist Nick DiMichino (NineDays [Something To Listen To, Monday Songs, Three, The Madding Crowd, So Happily Unsatisfied, Flying the Corporate Jet]), (Matt White [Best Days]). The band recorded two albums (only one which was released).\nIn the mid-1990s, Marchello and sons Gene Marchello and Stefan Marchello began playing out locally under \u201cThe Good Rats\u201d name. They released three new studio CDs with this lineup, Tasty Seconds (1996), Let's Have Another Beer (2000), and Play Dum (2002).  Marchello also released a live recording of a 1979 appearance on a Rochester radio show, Rats, The Way You Like \u2019Em.\nIn 1998, Marchello wrote \"A Tale of Two Balls,\" the introduction to the book Conflicts of Disinterest (Aardwolf Publishing) by Clifford Meth.In the 2000s, the band continued to play in local venues throughout New York, Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as playing annually in their own summer weekend outdoor festival aptly named \"Ratstock\".  At one point, the \"new\" Good Rats (Peppi and his sons) performed as the opening act for a reunion performance by the \"old\" Good Rats. Billed as \"The Original Good Rats\" Peppi was joined by Mickey, Kotke, Franco, and Gatto on October 4, 2008, in a small venue on Long Island, and for a pair of sold-out shows at B.B. King's in Manhattan.\nIn 2008, Gene Marchello left the band to go out on his own.  Nevertheless, The Good Rats, featuring Peppi and Stefan Marchello continued playing weekend club dates around Long Island.\nThe Good Rats were inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2008.\nPeppi Marchello is quoted prominently in the IDW Publishing graphic novel Snaked by Clifford Meth and has been the subject of other stories by the author.In July, 2009, Peppi Marchello cut a series of three commercials for the car donation organization Kars4Kids.In Magnolia Pictures 2011 release Roadie, the character Nikki pulls out Ratcity in Blue from Jimmy's vinyl record collection and they listen to a couple of tracks starting with \"Advertisement in the Voice\". This brings back memories of them seeing the band every Saturday night with their friend Steph when they were in high school. Peppi Marchello makes a cameo appearance in the film.\nIn 2012, Peppi Marchello released a new Good Rats album, Blue Collar Rats: The Lost Archives on his Uncle Rat Music label.  The CD contained one new song plus 19 previously unreleased songs recorded between 1975 and 1984, some featuring the original Good Rats line-up, and others including Kulick, Deale, Gene Marchello and various other musicians.\nThe Original Good Rats continued to play two spring shows (in one night) annually at Manhattan's B.B. King's, as well as a show in the fall at \"The Crazy Donkey\" in Long Island, until 2013.\nPeppi Marchello died on July 10, 2013, of a heart attack at his Nissequogue home. He was 68 and was recovering from heart surgery he had in June.Aardwolf Publishing announced the publication of Peppi Marchello: Song Writer on Kickstarter.In 2014, Stefan Marchello released a posthumous album of material that he and Peppi had worked on before Peppi's death, titled Afterlife. In 2016, he released Making Rock and Roll Great Again, an album that contains more of Peppi Marchello's posthumous material, plus some original material by Stefan Marchello.\nThe band now continues with Stefan Marchello.

{"id": "264_447", "question": "What music label is The Deep represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_53913", "text": "The Deep was an American psychedelic rock band made up of musicians from New York City, who in 1966 traveled to Philadelphia to record a one-time LP, Psychedelic Moods.  The band was experimentally progressive, as they were one of the earliest groups to record psychedelic music, before it was adapted by a wider array of musical acts.  Although their only album failed to achieve success, it later gained acclaim for being considered the earliest work to reference \"psychedelic\" in its title.Information on the band is sparse as only one band member had a confirmed musical career prior to recording. The member, Rusty Evans (born Marcus Uzilevsky, 1937, New York City, died December 5, 2015, Woodacre, California), was the Deep's lead guitarist, primary songwriter, and a vocalist.  Evans initially recorded in 1958 as a rockabilly singer, before performing as a Greenwich Village folk musician in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  He recorded three albums as Rusty Evans \u2013 Songs of Our Land, Railroad Songs (both 1964) and Live at Gerde's Folk City (1965) \u2013 and was later a member of the folk group The New Christy Minstrels. Musician David Bromberg is also known to have played on The Deep's one and only album, although it is unknown on which tracks he played.In the early summer of 1966, Evans convinced producer Mark Barkan to help him record a psychedelic album.  They secured arrangements with the Philadelphia-based Cameo-Parkway label, the home for fellow protopunk act Question Mark and the Mysterians, for a meager budget of $1200.  In August, Evans and Barkan assembled a group of New York musicians to record as the Deep, and they drove in a rundown car to Philadelphia to record what would become the Psychedelic Moods album, which was done in the short period of four days and would necessitate late-night sessions in order to be finished on time.  The all-night sessions also provided the musicians, who were unable to afford a hotel, with a place to sleep.While the exact release date of the album has yet to be definitively established, the record is generally considered to have been distributed in October 1966, based on the album's catalogue number. This would credit it as the first official album to include the word \"psychedelic\" in its title, pre-dating the Blues Magoos' debut, Psychedelic Lollipop, and The 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. The Deep's Psychedelic Moods did not sell well, and the group did not tour to support it. They existed as a studio-only band, and, aside from sessions for their album, produced no other recordings under that name.Evans left Cameo-Parkway to record a new album for the Columbia Records label in 1967. Abandoning the \"Deep\" name, this second album was credited to the band The Freak Scene and entitled Psychedelic Psoul. Despite the name change, the band still contained the original lineup from the first album, and the sound of this album is very similar to that of Psychedelic Moods. It is typically considered a follow-up in all but name. As its title suggests, Psychedelic Psoul is composed of psychedelic-influenced tracks as the band continued to develop past concepts from their debut album. However, The Freak Scene's album met the same results as Psychedelic Moods. They did not tour, and their album did not chart. The album has been rereleased by Sony BMG through Columbia Records on vinyl. The group disbanded in late 1967.After this venture, Evans returned to performing as a solo musician. He recorded under his birthname, Marcus, for a self-titled album in 1969, which produced compositions conceived as psychedelic folk in nature. He did not record another album until 1979, when he released Life's Railway Heaven, another folk effort. Evans recorded sporadically until his death, usually in the style of folk or rockabilly music,  and in the 1990s released two new age CDs, Slice of Light and Gypsy Dreams, credited as Uzca.  He also led a Johnny Cash tribute band.  Under his real name of Marcus Uzilevsky, he was a respected visual artist best known for his landscape paintings, and was exhibited widely in California.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_43121", "text": "Universal Records is a record label owned by Universal Music Group and operated as part of the Universal Motown Republic Group.

Breakaway sees Clarkson collaborating with various producers and songwriters for the first time, primarily Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, Ben Moody, and David Hodges; the latter two are former members of American rock band Evanescence. Despite the established commercial success of Thankful, music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an American Idol winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she was convinced by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, in pursuit of a pop rock direction. This also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release. Breakaway is primarily a pop rock record with elements of rock and soul music, marking a departure from the R&B-oriented sound of Thankful; its lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism.\nBreakaway received a positive response from music critics, with many commending the album's new-found pop rock sound and Clarkson's vocal performances. It received several awards and nominations, including winning two Grammy Awards and receiving a nomination for a Juno Award. The album became a commercial success worldwide. By selling over 12 million copies worldwide, Breakaway is Clarkson's best selling album of her career so far, and one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century.

Their successes prompted Billboard to credit her for landscaping the core sound of mainstream pop music as an uptempo dance-oriented sound in the 2000s. Furthermore, Breakaway established Clarkson as one of the four highest-selling acts of Sony BMG in the 2000s.

In an interview with Billboard, Maroon 5 guitarist James Valentine expressed some frustration in the lackluster sales of the Hands All Over, saying a new album may be coming sooner than was originally planned. \"Of course we could have liked it to have done better so far,\" Valentine told Billboard, \"It hasn't sold at the pace that our previous records did.\" The lack of response to the latest record has the band thinking about recording another album sooner than they originally planned, but according to Valentine \"that may not be a bad thing\". However, on the week of September 24, 2011, the album returned to the top 10 for the first time since its second week on the chart last October, climbing from number 23 to number 7 with 29,000 copies sold.

Bill Lamb from About.com was also positive, awarding it with 4 stars (out of 5), saying: \"For their third studio album Maroon 5 add a bit more rock and it looks good on them. There is a loosening up in sound here while keeping the infectious hooks that have always been a major part of the group's appeal. Don't go looking for exceptional depth, but in a period in which mainstream pop sounds are ruling the charts again, Maroon 5 provide a good lesson in exactly how to make a solid pop album\".The IGN review rated Hands All Over seven-stars out of ten, claiming that the album is \"programmed to hit all the bases: dance-y tracks, pop anthems, quasi-ballads. Almost every song on this record could be a single...Even though it's formulaic and delivers no surprises, fans of Maroon 5 should find exactly what they are looking for from this record.\" Jakob Dorof from Slant Magazines review was mixed saying, \"It adds a few more gems to the band's growing cache of incredible pop singles and overlooked deep cuts, Hands All Over makes some decent contributions to what could wind up being Maroon 5's true redemption: a damn fine greatest hits record.\" The Los Angeles Times review says that: \"Hands All Over reveals less about who frontman Adam Levine is than did Maroon 5's previous records; too often the songs cleave to opaque generalities\". Hugh Montgomery in The Observer wrote that 'Jaunty funk-pop and blustery arena balladry remain the order of the day, while Adam Levine's falsetto whine still proffers all the emotional gravitas of a mosquito'.Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone claimed, \"at the helm, the dozen songs on Hands All Over are models of craftsmanship and efficiency ...\" Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music noticed that \"The rude guitar sleaze of Hands All Over, or the cocky glam-stomp in Stutter's verses show a band who are really at their best when they play pop music like the sleazy rockers they clearly are.\" The Boston Globe review felt that \"This is lead singer Adam Levine's show. Thus, the band's success lives and dies with his delivery. That delivery remains technically sound, though as a whole, the band underwhelms here\". The Now review also felt that \"It's an accomplished record for singer Adam Levine and his faceless group, even if the whole affair sometimes sounds clinical in its approach\". The Yahoo! Music UK review was mixed, saying that \"It's hard to imagine how Hands All Over could have been any more underwhelming. In truth the only exceptional thing about it is just how average it is\".

During the five decades of his music career he has recorded 16 studio albums and collections, and 6 live albums. He is also a writer, having published autobiographic and noir novels, and a comics writer. Guccini also worked as actor, soundtrack composer, lexicographer and dialectologist.\nGuccini moved to P\u00e0vana during World War II, then returned to Modena where he spent his teenage years and established his musical career. His debut album, Folk beat n. 1, was released in 1967, but the first success was in 1972 with the album Radici. He was harshly criticised after releasing Stanze di vita quotidiana, and answered his critics with the song \"L'avvelenata\". His studio albums production slowed down in the nineties and 2000s, but his live performances continued being successful.\nHis lyrics have been praised for their poetic and literary value and have been used in schools as an example of modern poetry. Guccini has gained the appreciation of critics and fans, who regard him as an iconic figure. He has received several awards for his works; an asteroid, a cactus species and a butterfly subspecies have been named after him. The main instrument in most of his songs is the acoustic guitar.\nA leftist, though not a communist, Guccini dealt with political issues and more generally with the political climate of his time in some songs, such as \"La locomotiva\" or \"Eskimo\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_54733", "text": "The first album released by Guccini in the eighties was Metropolis, which was characterised by the description of cities with a symbolic value: Byzantium, Venice, Bologna and Milan. Their histories mingle with the distress caused by life in the city and with symbolic references. The album had richer arrangements, with saxophones, bass guitars, drums, clarinets, flutes and zufoli. Byzantium is described by Guccini as a fascinating yet oppressive city at the crossroads of two continents and two eras. The song is set at the time of Emperor Justinian I (483\u2013565), and there are many historical references to that period, that have been explained by Guccini himself. The narrator, Filemazio, who some critics believe to be a fictionalized Guccini, senses the decadence of his civilization and the coming of the end. The song was praised by critic Paolo Jachia, who described it as \"moving and dreamlike\". In 1981 Guccini was the co-author, along with Giorgio Gaber, Sandro Luporini and Gian Piero Alloisio, of the musical Gli ultimi viaggi di Gulliver. The eponymous song \"Gulliver\" was then included in Guccini's next album, Guccini, which dealt with the same themes found in Metropolis. Songs in the album include \"Shom\u00e8r ma mi llailah?\" (\"Watchman, what of the night?\", from Isaiah 21:11), \"Autogrill\", about a love only dreamt of, and \"Inutile\", which narrates a day two lovers spent in Rimini. The subsequent tour was the first in which Guccini performed with a backing band; previously, Guccini used to perform solo, or with just one or two guitarists. In 1984 the live album Fra la via Emilia e il West was released. It included live versions of many of his popular songs, recorded mainly at a concert held in Piazza Maggiore in Bologna, in which several guests performed alongside Guccini: Giorgio Gaber, Paolo Conte, I Nomadi, Roberto Vecchioni and Equipe 84.In 1987 the album Signora Bovary was released. Several of the songs portray people from Guccini's life: \"Van Loon\" is his father, \"Culodritto\" is his daughter Teresa, and \"Signora Bovary\" is himself. Other songs include \"Keaton\", written with his friend Claudio Lolli, and \"Scirocco\", an award-winning song about an episode in the life of the poet Adriano Spatola, a friend of Guccini. In 1988 the singer-songwriter released a live album, ...quasi come Dumas..., which included some of his songs from the Sixties, in a rearranged version. The title is a homage to Twenty Years After, the novel by Alexandre Dumas.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54732", "text": "In 1970 Guccini released his second album, Due anni dopo, recorded in the autumn of 1969. The main themes of the album are the passage of time and the analysis of everyday life in the context of bourgeois hypocrisy, with a noticeable influence from French music and from Leopardi's poetic style. After this album Guccini started his 10-year-long collaboration with folksinger Deborah Kooperman, who played fingerstyle guitar on it, a style mostly unknown in Italy at the time. Eleven months after Due anni dopo, the album L'isola non trovata was released. The title was a literary reference to Guido Gozzano, and the song \"La collina\" contained a reference to J. D. Salinger. Guccini's fame began to spread beyond Bologna, partly thanks to the appearance in the TV show Speciale tre milioni, where he sang some of his songs and befriended Claudio Baglioni. In 1971 he married his long-time girlfriend Roberta Baccilieri, who was pictured on the back cover of his next album.The turning point in Guccini's career was in 1972 thanks to the album Radici (roots), about the perpetual search for one's origins. This was also conveyed by the image on the front cover of the album, portraying Guccini's grandparents and their siblings next to their old mountain home. Radici contains some of his most renowned and popular songs, like \"Incontro\", \"Piccola Citt\u00e0\", \"Il vecchio e il bambino\", \"La Canzone della bambina portoghese\", \"Canzone dei dodici mesi\", and \"La locomotiva\", based on a real event and dealing with themes of equality, social justice and freedom, with a style similar to the anarchic music of the end of the 19th century. In the same year Guccini brought Claudio Lolli, a young singer-songwriter, to his record label, EMI Italiana. He later wrote two songs with him, \"Keaton\" and \"Ballando con una sconosciuta\".\nIn 1973 Guccini released Opera buffa, a light-hearted and playful album, which showed his skills as an ironic, theatrical and cultured cabaret artist. Guccini was perplexed by the release of the disc, especially because of its arrangements and because it was recorded live (with overdubs made in a recording studio). One year later Stanze di vita quotidiana was released, with a mixed reception by fans and critics. It included six long and melancholic songs, a mirror of the crisis Guccini faced, worsened by constant disagreements with his producer Pier Farri. Guccini received harsh criticism, including a slating by the critic Riccardo Bertoncelli, who said the singer songwriter was \"a finished artist, who has nothing else to say\". Guccini answered with the song \"L'avvelenata\", a few years later.\nGuccini had his first commercial success in 1976, with Via Paolo Fabbri 43, which was the sixth best-selling album of the year. It was named after the address of the house in Bologna where he lived. He sang with a more mature and determined voice, and the musical structure was more complex than in his earlier works. The album contained \"L'avvelenata\", a bitter and colourful reply to the criticism he received for Stanze di vita quotidiana, which cited one of his critics, Riccardo Bertoncelli. Later Guccini was reluctant in performing the song during concerts, saying it was obsolete. \nThe title track was an abstract description of Guccini's life in Bologna, which referenced Borges and Barthes; it also mentioned the \"three heroines of Italian song\", Alice, Marinella and Lilly, three women from songs by Italian singer-songwriters De Gregori, De Andr\u00e9 and Venditti. Other notable tracks were \"Canzone quasi d'Amore\", characterised by existential poetry, and \"Il pensionato\", about an old neighbour of Guccini, focusing on the sad psychological situation of some old people. Guccini's next album, Amerigo was released in 1978. The most popular song was \"Eskimo\", but Guccini claimed the highest point was the title track, a ballad about an emigrant uncle of his.\nIn 1977 the weekly magazine Grand Hotel featured Guccini on the cover titled \"The father every teenager would have liked to have\". Guccini did not endorse the article, which was based on an interview he did not know would be published, and commented: \"I cannot understand how they chose that title, I write songs for an audience of people in their thirties, I do not see how an audience of sixteen year olds fresh out of school could relate with the things I say\". In the same year, Guccini separated from his wife Roberta (the song \"Eskimo\" is about this event), and started cohabitating with Angela. In 1978 they had a daughter, Teresa, to whom the songs \"Culodritto\" and \"E un giorno...\" are dedicated. In 1979 the live album Album concerto, recorded in a concert with Nomadi, was released. It was peculiar because the songs were performed in duet with Augusto Daolio, and because it included previously unreleased songs: \"Dio \u00e8 morto\", \"Noi\", and \"Per fare un uomo\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Contrary to the album's title, it is not a \"live\" album but rather a studio recording.\nAlthough the album received generally positive reviews, many consumers were confused by its title and assumed it to be a live album, which in fact it was not. The title was actually a reference to Camp X-Ray, the temporary detention facility located at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Some fans and critics expressed their disappointment at the album's length, stating that a playing time of 26 minutes was not sufficient for a full-length album and that they had expected more creative output from the band. By this time, however, the band's members had drifted heavily into other projects (most notably singer/guitarist John Reis, who was simultaneously playing in Hot Snakes and Sultans and running his record label Swami Records) and were not as creatively dedicated to Rocket as they had been in the past. Cryptic liner notes written by Long Gone John seemed to indicate that the album was a \"last gasp\" of a band in turmoil and that it might be their final album.\nTouring in support of Live from Camp X-Ray was sparse due to the band members' commitments to other projects, and they would perform infrequently over the next few years. In August 2005, after breaking up Hot Snakes, Reis announced that Rocket from the Crypt would play their final performance on Halloween of that year.

Regarding the album's concept, she has described it as the exploration of \"the hunter and the hunted and how both exist within us\" through the story of \"a woman who finds herself in the dying embers of a relationship.\"Night of Hunters is Amos's first studio album recorded using only acoustic instruments, relying solely on her vocals and classically trained piano skills, along with a variety of accompanying string and woodwind instruments, to create its classical sound. Additionally, to record this album Amos broke a nearly 15-year-long collaboration with her studio and touring bandmates, choosing to work with a variety of new musicians, including the Berlin Philharmonic's principal clarinetist, Andreas Ottensamer, and the award-winning string quartet, Apollon Musag\u00e8te, while enlisting her daughter, Natashya Hawley, and niece, Kelsey Dobyns, as guest vocalists. Night of Hunters also marks the twentieth anniversary of her long-time collaboration with John Philip Shenale, who has contributed arrangements to most of her albums, beginning with her solo debut, Little Earthquakes (1992).\nThe album is Amos' first release on a classical music label. Like her previous releases, it is available in both standard and deluxe CD formats, digital format, as well as limited edition vinyl. Amos also released an entirely instrumental version of the album entitled Night of Hunters \u2013 Sin Palabras (without words) available only to download.\nThe main promotional single released from the album is \"Carry\", a variation on La fille aux cheveux de lin by Debussy.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_25349", "text": "Night Rider is a 1978 album by Oscar Peterson and Count Basie.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54849", "text": "Promotion for Night of Hunters kicked off on August 18, 2011, when Amos and Deutsche Grammophon debuted a video for the song Carry along with an audio stream of the song \"Shattering Sea\" on Facebook.

It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by Virgin Records (EMI France). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist Kelly Rowland, who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by Nervo.\nAccording to Rowland, the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album Here I Am (2011), while Guetta noted \"When Love Takes Over\" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds. Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track. Veronica Ferraro mixed the song, focusing primarily on giving Rowland's vocals a magical and inspiring tone. Critics would later state that Rowland's vocals on \"When Love Takes Over\" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist. The song's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other, while the production bears some similarities to Coldplay's 2002 hit single \"Clocks\".\n\"When Love Takes Over\" received universal acclaim. Most noted the addition of Rowland's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from One Love. The song was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries, including in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland. At the time of release, it became Guetta's highest-charting single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Rowland's second number one single in the United Kingdom. \"When Love Takes Over\" ranked at number one on Billboard's Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart. In 2013, Billboard named \"When Love Takes Over\" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time, in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging electronic dance music trend in America at its time of release.\nIn the song's accompanying music video, Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together. It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result. \"When Love Takes Over\" was promoted mainly at award shows, including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards, NRJ Music Awards and the World Music Awards. Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \"When Love Takes Over\" for the annual Miss Universe competition. The single earned several Platinum and Gold certifications, selling over 5.5 million copies worldwide.

Upon release, Doll Domination received mixed reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 becoming the group's highest charting album.

He then made the cross-county transition to Broadway, appearing in Kid Boots (1923), the Ziegfeld Follies of 1924, Ziegfeld Follies of 1925, and Good News (1927).George Olsen and his orchestra were in Eddie Cantor's 1928 Broadway hit Whoopee!, and in the 1930 movie version. In the Follies George met a singer, Ethel Shutta, who sings and dances memorably in Whoopee!, and they married, appearing together in nightclubs and on radio. They had two children, George Jr. and Charles; following a divorce, Olsen opened a restaurant in Paramus, New Jersey. Olsen and Shutta were heard on the Oldsmobile Program on CBS radio in 1933. He also was an orchestra leader for The Jack Benny Program on radio.\nOlsen signed with Victor in 1924 and remained as one of Victor's most popular bands until 1933 when he signed with Columbia. He stayed with Columbia through January, 1934. He recorded a single session in 1938 for Decca, and one final date for the rare Varsity label in 1940.\nOlsen's bands produced few stars. Singer-saxophonist Fred MacMurray passed through in 1930 on his way to eventual movie stardom, recording a vocal on I'm in the Market for You. Olsen's long-time alto saxist and singer, Fran Frey, with his distinctive, reedy bass-baritone, was perhaps the best known Olsenite until he left in 1933 for a career as a music director in radio.\nIn 1936, Olsen became leader of Orville Knapp's band after Knapp died in a plane crash. Olsen was chosen to lead the band by Knapp's widow. Morale problems plagued the group, and in 1938, after many musicians had already left, the group disbanded.\nA resident of Paramus, New Jersey, Olsen ran a popular local restaurant there on Paramus Road for many years before he died there on March 18, 1971. According to John S. Wilson in The New York Times, reviewing a retrospective of Olsen's recording \"George Olsen and His Music\" on RCA-Victor, in 1968, Olsen had a restaurant in Paramus, New Jersey, called \"George Olsen's\".

Plumb has sold more than 500,000 albums and over two million singles worldwide, co-penned songs for numerous other artists, including Michelle Branch, Mandisa, Mandy Moore, Jaci Velasquez, and Natalie Grant, and had music placed in many films and television shows. Originally signed as a contemporary Christian music recording artist in 1997, Plumb is now known as well as or better in alternative rock and EDM, and for the use of her music in film and television than she is in the contemporary Christian music market.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_55254", "text": "Tiffany Arbuckle was born in Indianapolis but grew up in Atlanta, singing in church and school. She moved to Nashville one week before her 21st birthday, where she now resides, and worked as a background singer for a number of artists, including Bill Gaither and Amy Grant.Plumb was originally formed in 1997 as a five-piece band that consisted of Arbuckle on vocals, Joe Porter on drums, Matt Stanfield on keyboards, J.J. Plasencio on bass guitar and Stephen Leiweke on guitar, with name, Plumb, coming from the Suzanne Vega song \"My Favorite Plum\". Following Silvertone Records affiliate Essential Records mainstream alternative radio success with its debut artist Jars of Clay in 1995, the label signed Plumb as its second artist. When Arbuckle was urged to write, she turned to Matt Bronleewe\u2014an original member of Jars of Clay who happened to be her next-door neighbor\u2014and the two hit it off. The debut album, Plumb, was released in 1997. Plumb has said subsequently that the addition of the letter \"B\" to the end was the idea of her producer Matt Bronleewe and, in her mind, also represents Bronleewe's important contribution to her sound.In 1999, Plumb released a second studio album, Candycoatedwaterdrops, which won the 2000 Gospel Music Association Dove Award for \"Modern Rock Album of the Year\". Three tracks from it were later covered by other artists; \"Stranded\" and \"Here with Me\" by Jennifer Paige and, in 2001, \"Damaged\" by Plummet. Though the album won the DOVE Award for Best Modern Rock Album in 2000, and saw strong radio success with the single \"God-Shaped Hole\", the subject matter and approach of much of Plumb's music was often considered too dark and taboo for the mainstream Christian marketplace. Plumb's tendency to write songs about deeply personal issues, such as international hit \"Cut\" which addressed cutting, and \"Damaged\" which addressed a girl coping with being molested as a child, led to more enthusiastic reception by fans of alternative and dance music. Fueling the break from contemporary Christian music, \"Cut\" was also used prominently during a pivotal scene in the storyline of The Vampire Diaries in the 10th episode of season 1, \"The Turning Point\". Later in 1999, all band members left the band, and since that time Plumb became a solo project of Tiffany Arbuckle.\nPlumb considered leaving the music industry after the 2000 album, but changed her mind after receiving a note from a fan a few hours before what she thought to be her final concert. The letter was about her song \"Damaged\" about a girl coping with being molested as a child. The note said \"Whatever you do, I just want you to never forget that you have changed someone's life,\" which inspired Plumb to remain in the music industry. She signed to Curb Records in 2003, releasing the album Beautiful Lumps of Coal on March 25, 2003. The lead single, \"Real\", peaked at No. 41 on the UK Singles Chart. Her next album, Chaotic Resolve, entered the Billboard 200 album chart at No. 177 on March 9, 2006. \"Better\" reached No. 1 on the U.S. Christian airplay chart. The Bronleewe & Bose remix of her follow-up \"Cut\", hit No. 1 on SiriusXM's dance hits channel BPM, and No. 5 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart.Shortly after the birth of her second child, Plumb recorded her fifth album, Blink, as a collection of lullaby inspired songs. It was released on October 9, 2007, immediately becoming one of her best selling and most enduring albums to date. Lead single \"In My Arms\" was used in conjunction with key plot narratives for both Vampire Diaries and One Tree Hill, and became Plumb's biggest international hit to date, selling close to half a million singles in both the United States and Russia. \"In My Arms\" received remixes by Kaskade, Scotty K, Bronleewe & Bose, Gomi, and Bimbo Jones, with the latter reaching the No. 3 spot on the Billboard Dance chart.On May 19, 2009, Curb Records announced that it would release a career-spanning greatest hits album, Beautiful History, which was released later in the year and included several new songs. The first single from Beautiful History, \"Hang On\", reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2009 and reached the top spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in 2010.\nPlumb returned to the studio in 2010 with longtime producer and co-writer Matt Bronleewe to begin work on what would become her 6th studio album, while also changing management and signing with alternative boutique firm Street Talk Media. The debut single from the project, \"Drifting\", a co-penned duet with longtime friend Dan Haseltine (of Jars of Clay), spread quickly across Christian rock radio. The second single, \"Need You Now (How Many Times)\", went to contemporary Christian music radio in early 2012 and has become Plumb's most successful single to date in that market, rising to number to No. 1 on multiple radio and iTunes charts in both the United States and Canada by year's end. The single has remained in regular rotation nationwide for well over a year, selling close to 300,000 singles on iTunes to date, and is BDS certified at over 100,000 radio spins. The album Need You Now was released worldwide in February 2013, charting at a career-best No. 56 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 2 on Christian album charts. The album received five Dove Award nominations including Song of the Year and Contemporary/Pop Album of the Year. With her children now all at least grade school age, and with the massive success of Need You Now, 2012 and 2013 saw the most aggressive touring of her entire career, playing major festivals throughout 2012 and 2013, embarking on her first and largely sold-out headlining tour in the fall of 2013, and joining the massive Winterjam arena tour for November 2013-14.Plumb released her seventh studio album, Exhale, on May 4, 2015.Plumb left Curb Records in early 2017 to form her own label, Plumb Music, and released her first single \"God Help Me\" in July 2017. The song was one of six tracks included on the EP God Help Me in late 2017. She followed it up with the album Beautifully Broken in June 2018 on Centricity Music.Following the No. 1 chart successes of \"In My Arms\", \"Hang On\", and \"Cut\", Plumb has been increasingly sought-after in the dance and electronic world. In 2011, she collaborated with trance DJ Paul Van Dyk on \"I Don't Deserve You\", playing several shows with Van Dyk, and filming a music video together in middle Tennessee.

Ken Tucker believed the band had eschewed the \"brooding artiness\" of their previous albums for more hooks and pop-oriented songs. Chapman later said, \"I didn't make a punk album or a New Wave album with Blondie. I made a pop album.\" The album's eleven pop songs have refined melodics, and its sole disco song, \"Heart of Glass\", features jittery keyboards, rustling cymbals by drummer Clem Burke, and a circular rhythm. Burke credited Kraftwerk and the soundtrack to the film Saturday Night Fever as influences for the song and said that he was \"trying to get that groove that the drummer for the Bee Gees had\".Lyrically, Parallel Lines abandoned what Rolling Stone magazine's Arion Berger called the \"cartoonish postmodernist referencing\" of Blondie's previous new wave songs in favor of a \"romantic fatalism\" that was new for the band. \"Sunday Girl\" deals with the theme of teen loneliness. Music critic Rob Sheffield said that the lyric \"dusty frames that still arrive / die in 1955\", in \"Fade Away and Radiate\", is the \"best lyric in any rock'n'roll song, ever, and it's still the ultimate statement of a band that always found some pleasure worth exploiting in the flashy and the temporary.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

They also proved to be influential, both during their initial run and to a new generation of musicians like Yo La Tengo and Espers.As the Holy Modal Rounders, Stampfel and Weber began playing in Greenwich Village, at the heart of the ongoing American folk music revival. Their sense of humor, irreverent attitude, and novel update of old-time music brought support from fellow musicians but also caused controversy amongst folk purists in the scene. In 1964, the Rounders made history with their self-titled debut, which included the first use of \"psychedelic\" in popular music. After their first two studio albums, the duo briefly joined the newly formed underground rock band the Fugs in 1965 and helped record the band's influential debut album. \nFollowing their exit from the Fugs, the duo released two albums that experimented with psychedelic folk before they expanded their lineup to a full rock band by the end of 1968.

According to the LA Weekly, \"'Apply' and its sister songs \u2014 the swooning 'Learn,' haunted shuffler 'Glad' or the Kate Bush\u2013meets-Cluster 'Tremel' \u2014 do sport the built-in intimacy common to good bedroom recordings, but they also possess hints of grandiose and mercurial qualities.\"The Apply EP was followed over a year later by Glasser's first full-length studio album, Ring, co-produced by Swedish producer Van Rivers and the Subliminal Kid. According to Pitchfork, \"there isn't an easy descriptor for Glasser's sound-- she incorporates bits of tropical pop, tribal percussion, and a couple of different strains of electronic music. Her songs sidestep traditionally linear arrangements for a more open, circular approach-- they kind of swoosh around without pausing at verse-chorus intersections.\"Glasser's second album, Interiors, came out in 2013. The album was inspired, according to Mesirow, by Dutch architect and theorist Rem Koolhaas' 1978 book Delirious New York. The album's themes and sounds reflected the artist's move from Los Angeles to downtown Manhattan. \"The interiors Glasser explores,\" wrote Pitchfork, \"most compellingly are, it won't surprise you at this point to learn, the ones within human beings. She applies the same ruthless precision to these ostensibly messier subjects, so that video selection \"Design\", an examination of physical desire that wields human breaths as percussion, is crystalline enough for a posh gallery. But the insides of people turn out to be at least as unknowable as those of buildings.\"In 2018, Glasser resurfaced with the self-released, experimental EP Sextape, featuring spoken word descriptions of a variety of sexual experiences over danceable beats. Pitchfork commended the project for engaging \"directly with the thorniness of queer intimacy, the complications that arise when queer people seek each other out to dance, to flirt, and to fuck each other.\"In 2022, Glasser again resurfaced with a single titled New Scars, released on One Little Independent Records.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Some of his songs, such as \"It Sure Is Monday\" and \"Gonna Get a Life\", have featured influences of Cajun music through prominent use of fiddle and accordion.Chesnutt's musical persona placed a greater emphasis on song quality over physical attractiveness, compared to the move toward young and attractive males that prevailed in country music in the 1990s.
