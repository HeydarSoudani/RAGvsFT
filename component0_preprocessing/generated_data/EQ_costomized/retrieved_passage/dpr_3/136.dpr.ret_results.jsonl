After the release of their sophomore album Pure (1992) and their major label debut Selfless (1994), they started experimenting with live drums as well as hip hop and breakbeat sounds. The resulting albums, Songs of Love and Hate (1996) and Us and Them (1999), were followed by Hymns (2001), which saw a simplification of the band's style.

His mother, Muriel, died three weeks after he was born. From the age of 6, he lived in St Annes-on-Sea, a place he described as being \"like a cemetery with bus stops\". He was brought up by his father and stepmother, with whom he became disillusioned because of her religious beliefs (although they reconciled in 1980, just before her death). His anti-religious views would later become a familiar theme within his music.Harper began writing poems when he was 12. At the age of 13. he began playing skiffle music with his younger brother David (\"Davey\" on the album Flat Baroque and Berserk), as well as becoming influenced by blues music. At 14 he formed his first group (De Boys) with his brothers David and Harry. Harper was educated at King Edward VII School, Lytham St Annes, then a grammar school, and left at the age of 15 (1956) to join the Royal Air Force to follow an ambition to be a pilot. After two years Harper rejected the rigid discipline and feigned madness to obtain a military discharge, as a result receiving an electroconvulsive therapy treatment at Princess Mary's RAF Hospital, Wendover. After being discharged from there, he spent one day inside the former Lancaster Moor Mental Institute before escaping. These experiences would be recalled in \"Committed\", a song on Harper's debut album, Sophisticated Beggar. From around 1961 he busked around North Africa, Europe and London for a few years.\nMusically, Harper's earliest influences were American blues musician Lead Belly and folk singer Woody Guthrie and, in his teens, jazz musician Miles Davis. Of the blues musicians Lead Belly, Big Bill Broonzy, and Josh White, Harper said they made music which \"...seemed to be from a different planet ...We'd never heard anything like it. It changed our world overnight, a sledge hammer of a cultural change ...an equivalent would be to suddenly hear music from outer space\". Harper was also exposed to classical music in his childhood and has pointed to the influence of Jean Sibelius's Karelia Suite. Lyrical influences include the 19th century Romantics, especially Shelley, and Keats's poem \"Endymion\". Harper has also cited the Beat poets as being highly influential, particularly Jack Kerouac. Harper played his first paid performance at a poetry reading in Newcastle in 1960.\nReturning to the UK in 1963 or 1964, Harper started to write more songs than poetry. He obtained a residency at London's famous Soho folk music club Les Cousins in 1965, having been introduced to it by Peter Bellamy of The Young Tradition. Harper's first advertised performance was on 5 October 1965.

It was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Yamato Transport and the Nippon Television Network, and stars the voices of Minami Takayama, Rei Sakuma and Kappei Yamaguchi. The story follows Kiki, a young witch who moves to the port city of Koriko with her cat Jiji and starts a flying courier service.\nIn 1987, Group Fudosha asked Kadono's publishers for the rights to the novel to be made into a film by either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. Production began near the release of My Neighbor Totoro (1988). Miyazaki initially worked as producer, but took over directing from Sunao Katabuchi as he became more involved in the project. As the novel is based on a fictional northern European country, Miyazaki and his team traveled to locations such as Visby, Sweden, to research its landscape. Miyazaki altered the story, adding new scenes to emphasize the theme of independence and growing up. According to Miyazaki, the film portrays the gulf between independence and reliance among teenage Japanese girls.Kiki's Delivery Service was released in Japan on July 29, 1989, by the Toei Company.

As a quartet they self-released three demo tapes: Rehearsal Outtake, Bloodlust and Perversion (both in 1992) and Journey Through the Cold Moors of Svarttjern (in 1993). However, Damnatus and Lord Blackmangler left afterwards, and Carpathian Forest became once more a duo.\nCarpathian Forest would release their first studio work in 1995: the extended play Through Chasm, Caves and Titan Woods, via Avantgarde Music. It would be their first of many releases via Avantgarde.\nIn 1998 the band released their first full-length album, Black Shining Leather, once more via Avantgarde Music. It was their only release to feature Lazare (who would later join Borknagar) on the band's line-up as a drummer. In the same year they also played their first concert at the Under the Black Sun Festival in Sch\u00f6nermark, Germany.\nLazare left Carpathian Forest in 1999, the same year Anders Kobro, Tchort and Daniel Vrangsinn joined them as permanent members. In the following year, their second full-length, Strange Old Brew, was released. It was their most experimental album so far. By the end of the year they also released a single, \"He's Turning Blue\".\nIn 2001, founding member Nordavind left Carpathian Forest, during the recording sessions of their third studio album, Morbid Fascination of Death, that still retained the experimentation (although to a lesser extent) of their previous release, Strange Old Brew.

He is quoted as saying: \"I met with Nattefrost a few weeks ago and we decided to focus on a new album, but we haven't even started writing it yet.

D.O.P.E. also continued to work as a producer, including work on a large portion of Str8jakkett's Mood Swings album. He was offered a major-label deal with Arista Records that fell through when the label folded. He is currently working on a new album, \"Beats Rhymes & Life\".\nDVS Mindz never officially broke up, but it remained largely inactive during the 2000s and 2010s.

I'm introducing myself to the world.\" The disc received a lukewarm review from The Pitch writer Andrew Miller: \u201cHis beats sound like they've been sitting on the shelf for at least a decade ... at 78 minutes, Mood Swings runs a few tracks too long and includes the standard rap-album filler: voice-mail messages, a bank-robbery skit and a fake live radio spot from \u2018DJ Dick Goesinya at Club Nutsack.\u2019\" Journalist Chris Mills countered with a glowing review in Demencha Magazine, stating, \"Str8jakkett is a pure lyricist with a seasoned delivery and a flashy vocabulary ... Most of the beats on Mood Swings have a refreshing, bassy, West Coat influence, while Str8's manner of rapping is sodden with enough straight talk to please any indie head.\" Mood Swings included a re-recording of the unreleased DVS Mindz track \"Flamethrower,\" with Str8jakkett replacing the second and third verses recorded by DL and Killa The Hun, respectively. Another old DVS Mindz song, \"Birds,\" was given a complete makeover, as was a retooled version of \"DVS Mindbender,\" which appeared in its original form on Million Dolla Broke Niggaz.\nStr8kjakkett issued a second solo effort in 2008 titled, G.A.M.E. Grown-Ass Man Experience. The effort included \"The DVS Story\" where Str8jakkett recounted the band's rise and fall in candid terms.

The Village Wait, which caused Pentangle to be referred to as one of the progenitors of British folk rock.In their final two albums Pentangle returned to their folk-jazz roots, but by then the genre's musical tastes had moved to British folk rock.

Minogue is the highest-selling female recording artist from Australia, having sold over 80 million records worldwide. She has been recognised for reinventing herself in music as well as fashion, and is referred to by the European press as the \"Princess of Pop\" and a style icon. Her accolades include two Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards and eighteen ARIA Music Awards.\nBorn and raised in Melbourne, Minogue first achieved recognition starring as Charlene Robinson in the Australian soap opera Neighbours (1986\u20131988). She began her music career in the late 1980s, releasing four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums under PWL. By the early 1990s, Minogue had amassed several top ten singles in Australia and the UK, including \"The Loco-Motion\", \"I Should Be So Lucky\", \"Especially for You\", \"Hand on Your Heart\" and \"Better the Devil You Know\". Taking more creative control over her music, she signed with Deconstruction Records in 1993 and released the albums Kylie Minogue (1994) and Impossible Princess (1997).\nBy joining Parlophone in 1999, Minogue returned to mainstream dance-oriented music with Light Years (2000), including the number-one hits \"Spinning Around\" and \"On a Night Like This\". The follow-up, Fever (2001), was an international breakthrough for Minogue, becoming her best-selling album to date. Its lead single, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" became one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, selling over five million units. Follow up singles, \"In Your Eyes\" and \"Love at First Sight\" became hits as well. She continued reinventing her image and experimenting with a range of genres on her subsequent albums, which spawned successful singles such as \"Slow\", \"I Believe in You\", \"2 Hearts\" and \"All the Lovers\". In 2017, she partnered with BMG Rights Management, with \"Dancing\" (2018) as their first release. In the following years, Minogue became the only female artist to have a number-one album and a top ten single, from the 1980s to the 2020s in the UK charts, with Disco (2020) and \"Padam Padam\" (2023) respectively.\nIn film, Minogue made her debut in The Delinquents (1989), and appeared in Street Fighter (1994), Moulin Rouge! (2001), Holy Motors (2012) and San Andreas (2015). In reality television, she appeared as a judge on The Voice UK and The Voice Australia both in 2014. Her other ventures include product endorsements, books, perfumes, charitable work and a wine brand. Minogue's achievements include being an ARIA Hall of Fame inductee, Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Chevalier (knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and an honorary Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_39560", "text": "Minogue explained she first became interested in pop music during her adolescence: \"I first got into pop music in 1981, I'd say. It was all about Prince, Adam + the Ants, that whole New Romantic period. Prior to that, it was the Jackson 5, Donna Summer, and my dad's records \u2013 the Stones and Beatles.\" She would also listen to the records of Olivia Newton-John and ABBA. She said she \"wanted to be\" Newton-John while growing up. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue during the early years of her music career with the observation: \"She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna ... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her.\" Minogue came to prominence in the music scene as a bubblegum pop singer and was deemed a \"product of the Stock Aitken Waterman Hit Factory\". Australian musician Nick Cave, who worked with her, was a major influence on her artistic development. She told The Guardian: \"He's definitely infiltrated my life in beautiful and profound ways.\" Throughout her career, her work was also influenced by British singer-songwriter-producer Cathy Dennis, British record producer D Mob, British band Scritti Politti, Icelandic singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rk, British rapper Tricky, Irish rock band U2 and Japanese pop band Pizzicato Five, among others.\nMinogue has been known for her soft soprano vocal range. Tim Sendra of AllMusic reviewed her album Aphrodite and said Minogue's \"slightly nasal, girl next door vocals serve her needs perfectly.\" According to Fiona MacDonald from Madison magazine, Minogue \"has never shied away from making some brave but questionable artistic decisions\". In musical terms, Minogue has worked with many genres in pop and dance music. However, her signature music has been contemporary disco music. Her first studio albums with Stock, Aitken, and Waterman present a more bubblegum pop influence, with many critics comparing her to American singer-songwriter Madonna. Chris True from AllMusic, reviewed her debut album, Kylie and found her music \"standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum\", however he stated she presented the most personality of any 1980s recording artist. He said of her third album Rhythm of Love, from the early 1990s, \"The songwriting is stronger, the production dynamic, and Kylie seems more confident vocally.\" At the time of her third studio album, \"She began to trade in her cutesy, bubblegum pop image for a more mature one, and in turn, a more sexual one.\" Chris True stated during her relationship with Australian singer-actor Michael Hutchence, \"her shedding of the near-virginal fa\u00e7ade that dominated her first two albums, began to have an effect, not only on how the press and her fans treated her, but in the evolution of her music.\"Her self-titled fifth studio album, primarily a dance-pop album integrating elements of R&B and adult contemporary music saw a shift in her music. Chris True of AllMusic stated the album is a \"remarkable change from Minogue's previous teen pop material\" and the \"start of a second phase\" in her music career. From her work on her sixth studio album, Impossible Princess, her songwriting and musical content began to change. She was constantly writing down words, exploring the form and meaning of sentences. She had written lyrics before, but called them \"safe, just neatly rhymed words and that's that\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine said the album bears a resemblance to Madonna's Ray of Light (1998). He said she took inspiration from \"both the Britpop and electronica movements of the mid-'90s\", saying \"Impossible Princess is the work of an artist willing to take risks\".Her seventh studio album, Light Years is a disco-influenced dance-pop record, with AllMusic's Chris True calling it \"Arguably one of the best disco records since the '70s\". True stated her eighth studio album, Fever, \"combines the disco-diva comeback of Light Years with simple dance rhythms\". Her ninth studio album, Body Language, was quite different from her musical experiments in the past as it was a \"successful\" attempt at broadening her sound with electro and hip-hop for instance. Incorporating styles of dance music with funk, disco and R&B, the album was listed on Q's \"Best Albums of 2003\".Critics said Minogue's tenth studio album X did not feature enough \"consistency\" and Chris True called the tracks \"cold, calculated dance-pop numbers.\" Tim Sendra of AllMusic said her eleventh album, Aphrodite, \"rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems\" and \"the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop that really is her strong suit.\" Sendra found Aphrodite \"One of her best, in fact.\" Kiss Me Once, her twelfth studio album has been described by critics as her return to contemporary pop music.Her fourteenth studio album, Golden was heavily influenced by country music, although maintaining her dance-pop sensibilities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote \"Golden further bolsters Minogue's reputation for taking risks\u2014and artfully sets the stage for her inevitable disco comeback.\" For her fifteenth studio album, Disco, she began\nto audio engineer her own music due to the restrictions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_24573", "text": "Akcent (Romanian pronunciation: [ak\u02c8t\u0361\u0283ent]) is a Romanian dance pop group whose members sing in Romanian, English and Spanish.

Like the Grateful Dead, the Jerry Garcia Band played rock music that was influenced by blues, folk, country, and jazz in an improvisatory milieu that largely served as a framework for Garcia's solos. However, the group eschewed the former band's avant-garde and world music influences in favor of a slower, groove-based \"bar band\" approach strongly oriented toward rhythm and blues (the band often featured female backing vocalists characteristic of the genre), gospel music and reggae. Rock versions of contemporary Americana were also prominent. The relatively languorous tempos were dictated by Garcia and Kahn, much to the chagrin of longtime drummer David Kemper: \"[I]t bothered me from the very beginning. I\u2019d say, \u2018You know we need some uptempo material, it\u2019s just putting me to sleep; the band is putting me to sleep.\u2019 At first I\u2019d say these things, and then I just decided to go with it. It is what it is, and who was I to say anything? This band preceded me; the whole concept of the band preceded me.\"Staples of the band's repertoire included Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland's \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\" (widely perceived as the group's signature song and their most-performed song), Peter Rowan's \"Midnight Moonlight,\" Jimmy Cliff's \"The Harder They Come\" and \"Sitting in Limbo,\" the Sensational Nightingales' \"My Sisters and Brothers,\" Hank Ballard's \"Tore Up Over You,\" Bob McDill and Allen Reynolds' \"Catfish John,\" John Lennon's \"Dear Prudence,\" Jesse Stone's \"Don't Let Go,\" Allen Toussaint's \"I'll Take a Melody\" and \"Get Out of My Life, Woman\", Little Milton's \"That's What Love Will Make You Do,\" Chuck Berry's \"Let It Rock\" and \"You Never Can Tell,\" Bruce Cockburn's \"Waiting for a Miracle,\" Irving Berlin's \"Russian Lullaby,\" Smokey Robinson's \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\" and \"I Second That Emotion,\" Peter Tosh's \"Stop That Train,\" Bob Marley's \"Stir It Up,\" Robbie Robertson's \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\" the Manhattans' \"Shining Star,\" Van Morrison's \"And It Stoned Me\" and \"Bright Side of the Road\" and Norton Buffalo's \"Ain't No Bread in the Breadbox.\" The band also performed Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's \"Ol' Man River\" and Miles Davis' \"So What\" on one occasion apiece. As with the Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia regularly covered many songs by Bob Dylan with the group, including \"Tangled Up in Blue,\" \"Simple Twist of Fate,\" \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" \"Forever Young,\" \"Se\u00f1or (Tales of Yankee Power),\" \"Tears of Rage,\" \"I Shall Be Released,\" \"Tough Mama\" and \"When I Paint My Masterpiece.\"\nThe group did not perform between November 1978 and October 1979; during that year, Garcia, Kahn and keyboardist Merl Saunders (who performed with Garcia and Kahn from 1971 to 1975 in the Saunders/Garcia Band and Legion of Mary) briefly performed in Reconstruction, a more egalitarian jazz-funk ensemble.\nAccording to Linda Kahn in a 2017 Reddit Ask Me Anything prompt, much of the band's repertoire was curated by her husband: \"[H]e did bring most of the cover material to the table. He has a big record collection and they're all in really good shape, he was pretty anal about his records. I think as far as picking songs, he listened to records all the time, so it depends on whoever was in the band and whatever group was playing at the time and that influenced John a lot.\"Although the repertoire was strongly tilted toward covers, several Garcia-Robert Hunter originals (including \"Run for the Roses,\" \"Mission in the Rain,\" \"Gomorrah,\" \"Cats Under the Stars\" and \"Reuben and Cherise\") were performed exclusively or near-exclusively by the Jerry Garcia Band. Some of the band's original repertoire (most notably \"Deal,\" \"They Love Each Other,\" \"Sugaree,\" and \"Friend of the Devil\") was shared with the Grateful Dead.\nDuring Garcia's lifetime, the Jerry Garcia Band released one studio album, Cats Under the Stars, and one live album, Jerry Garcia Band. A number of additional live albums were released posthumously.\nThe group was an indirect beneficiary of the commercial success of the Grateful Dead's  In the Dark (1987); as the latter group transitioned to summer stadium tours and multi-night arena engagements during their autumn and spring tours, the tour itineraries of the Garcia Band (hitherto confined to clubs and small theaters) came to encompass arenas (primarily in Garcia's key northeastern United States market) and outdoor amphitheaters favored by the Grateful Dead in the early 1980s. During this period, the group continued to play as many as fifteen concerts a year in an informal residency at The Warfield, a 2,300-capacity theater in San Francisco. Clarence Clemons also guested with them on tour for a brief time in 1989 and 1990.Kahn briefly led the group (rechristened JGB) following Garcia's death in 1995. Seals became the bandleader after Kahn's death in 1996; as of 2017, he is the only remaining member from the final iteration of the Jerry Garcia Band in JGB.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39603", "text": "Following are the lineups for the Jerry Garcia Band's live performances.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They formed in 1986 in Brisbane by Carol Rohde on vocals and keyboards (ex-Ironing Music) and David Smith on vocals, guitar and keyboards. They were soon joined by keyboardist, Brett Mitchell, and somewhat later by drummer-percussionist Crispin Trist.Boxcar independently issued cassette-only material including an album, P.C.M.. Their early work sounded similar to contemporaries, Cabaret Voltaire and Severed Heads. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, explained \"the intention was to combine noise with a beat, technology with a decent song.\" AllMusic's Michael Sutton felt they \"sounded more like New Order [the similarity] is mainly in the weary vocals of [Smith], which easily recalls Bernard Sumner's melancholic tone.\"Boxcar played live shows in the Brisbane area and then other capitals; at gigs they wore gas masks. Performing electronic music live was a difficult feat given the preference in Australian live venues for guitar-driven pub rock and they would sometimes be jeered by members of the crowd. McFarlane observed \"[they] made little headway, mostly due to a general lack of interest in electronic dance-pop within the rock milieu, rather than any lack of talent on the musicians' part.\"They signed with Volition Records/Sony Music Australia to release a single, \"Freemason (You Broke the Promise)\", in November 1988. When issued in the United States via Arista Records/Nettwerk Records in the following year, it hit No. 8 on the Billboard dance chart. Initially criticised in the local press for being derivative of New Order they nevertheless built a local following, despite a lack of commercial radio airplay for electronic music. They followed with two more singles, which also appeared on the Billboard dance chart: \"Insect\" (remixed by noted producer Arthur Baker) at No. 20 and \"Gas Stop (Who Do You Think You Are?)\" (remixed by Francois Kevorkian) at No. 8. In Australia, \"Gas Stop\" peaked at No. 82 on the ARIA singles chart.The group's first album on Volition, Vertigo, was released in November 1990. Boxcar's line-up was Mitchell on additional programming; Rohde on keyboards and programming; Smith on vocals, guitars and keyboards; and Trist on drums and programming. It was produced by Robert Racic (Severed Heads, Single Gun Theory) and recorded at Sun Studios, CBS Studios, and Albert Studios, Sydney.Vertigo received mixed reviews from critics: AllMusic's William Cooper rated it at two-and-a-half stars out-of five and explained \"[a]lthough the New Order inspired arrangements are derivative, Vertigo is redeemed by Boxcar's upbeat, catchy melodies\"; McFarlane opined that it \"was a very accessible collision of sound, song and dance beats.\" It had a fairly pop feel, however the band also included more experimental instrumentals, such as \"Comet\" (also on the B-side of the \"Freemason\" single) and \"Lelore\" (featuring an eerie wailing as the centrepiece \"vocal\", which was released as a single in its own right). The group toured Australia as supports for New Order, Depeche Mode, Erasure and then Pet Shop Boys.\nIn 1992 Rohde and Trist left the group, which relocated to Sydney, where they added a keyboardist, Stewart Lawler. In September of that year they issued a remix album, Revision, with re-workings of Vertigo' tracks by various producers. One of the remixers is Tom Ellard from Severed Heads.\nBoxcar's second studio album, Algorhythm, was released in November 1994. The Canberra Times' Nicole Leedham reported \"[it] is pure techno and is best heard on a dance floor, but if your house doesn't come equipped with one of those the best alternative is to light some candles and\nlose yourself in the hypnotic sound.\" McFarlane noticed \"[i]t was another modern-sounding album without being too clean or sterile.\"Algorhythm was a notably more trance and house-influenced effort than the  synth-pop of Vertigo and provided the singles \"Universal Hymn\", \"What Are You So Happy About?\" (featured on the soundtrack to the 1996 film Love and Other Catastrophes) and \"People Get High\". The album took almost another two full years until it was released in the United Kingdom and Europe in 1996 on Pulse-8. Although not officially defunct, it was around about 1997 that Boxcar started to play fewer live dates.\nIn October 2007, an announcement was made of their return gig participating in the Upgrade night at QUT.

It stars Harry Dean Stanton and Emilio Estevez, with Tracey Walter, Olivia Barash, Sy Richardson, Vonetta McGee, Fox Harris, and Dick Rude among the supporting cast. Set in Los Angeles, the plot concerns a young punk rocker (Estevez) who is recruited by a car repossession agency and gets caught up in the pursuit of a mysterious Chevrolet Malibu that might be connected to extraterrestrials.\nA satire of America under the Reagan administration, consumerism and the Atomic Age, Repo Man was developed by Cox in partnership with his fellow film school graduates from UCLA, independent producers Jonathan Wacks and Peter McCarthy. His inspiration for the film came from his own experiences working with repossession agent Mark Lewis. Originally conceiving of it as a road movie, Cox reconfigured the story to take place mostly in Los Angeles to maintain its budget. Michael Nesmith of The Monkees came on board the project as an executive producer, and secured a negative pickup deal with Universal Pictures. Principal photography ran through summer 1983, during which Cox encouraged improvisation from the cast; the film's ending notably differed from what had originally been written.

They released a series of demos and splits with local bands during their rehearsal era. During this period, the group gradually altered their sound with influence from proto-black metal bands like Celtic Frost and Venom, and in the process became one of the inaugurators of black metal. Their 1989 demo, Satanas Tedeum, presented a crossover between black metal and grindcore. In 1991, the band released Passage to Arcturo, their career-breaking EP.\nOne of band's major debuts was on the 1993 \"Fuck Christ Tour\", which also featured Immortal and Blasphemy. During this concert, some audience members had engaged in cutting and self-mutilation that resulted in hospitalization. Before signing to Unisound Records (a now-defunct Athens-based independent record label founded in 1992), Mayhem's \u00d8ystein Aarseth had expressed interest in distributing the band through his Deathlike Silence Productions label, but due to Aarseth's murder the same year, nothing materialized. The band signed to Century Media in 1996 and remained on their roster for 10 years before joining Season of Mist.\nRotting Christ has played in many regions outside their native Greece, including the Americas, Greater Europe, Russia, the United Kingdom, Malta, the Middle East and South Africa. Several heavy metal festivals around the world have hosted the band, including the 2003 Wacken Open Air in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.

Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, James began his musical career in his teenage years. He was in various bands before entering the U.S. Navy Reserve to avoid being drafted into the army. In 1964, James moved to Toronto, Canada, where he formed the rock band the Mynah Birds, who eventually signed a recording deal with Motown Records in 1966. James's career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and eventually convicted him of desertion related charges. He served several months in jail.  After being released, James moved to California, where he started a variety of rock and funk groups in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nAfter forming the locally popular Stone City Band in his hometown of Buffalo in 1977, James finally found success as a recording artist after signing with Motown's Gordy Records, releasing the album Come Get It! in 1978 which produced the hits \"You & I\" and \"Mary Jane\". In 1981, James released his most successful album, Street Songs, which included career-defining hits such as \"Give It to Me Baby\" and \"Super Freak\", the latter song becoming his biggest crossover single, mixing elements of funk, disco, rock, and new wave. James was also known for his soulful ballads such as \"Fire & Desire\" and \"Ebony Eyes\". He also had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists including Teena Marie, the Mary Jane Girls, the Temptations, Eddie Murphy, and Smokey Robinson.\nJames's mainstream success had peaked by the release of his album Glow in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show, The A-Team. His subsequent album releases failed to sell as well as their predecessors. Rapper MC Hammer sampled James's \"Super Freak\" for his 1990 hit, \"U Can't Touch This\" which won Best R&B Song at the 1991 Grammy Awards. James received his only Grammy for composing the song. By the early 1990s, James's career was hampered by his drug addiction and he was embroiled in legal issues. In 1993, he was convicted of two separate instances of kidnapping and assaulting two different women while under the influence of crack cocaine, resulting in a three-year sentence at Folsom State Prison. He was released on parole in 1996. His health problems halted his career again after he had a mild stroke during a concert in 1998, and he announced a semi-retirement.\nIn 2004, James's career returned to mainstream pop culture after he appeared in an episode of Chappelle's Show.

With George, he wrote more than a dozen Broadway shows, featuring songs such as \"I Got Rhythm\", \"Embraceable You\", \"The Man I Love\" and \"Someone to Watch Over Me\". He was also responsible, along with DuBose Heyward, for the libretto to George's opera Porgy and Bess.\nThe success the Gershwin brothers had with their collaborative works has often overshadowed the creative role that Ira played. His mastery of songwriting continued after George's early death in 1937. Ira wrote additional hit songs with composers Jerome Kern, Kurt Weill, Harry Warren and Harold Arlen. His critically acclaimed 1959 book Lyrics on Several Occasions, an amalgam of autobiography and annotated anthology, is an important source for studying the art of the lyricist in the golden age of American popular song.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_39998", "text": "Gershwin was born at 60 Eldridge St in Manhattan, the oldest of four children of Morris (Moishe) and Rose Gershovitz (n\u00e9e Rosa Bruskin), who were Russian Jews from Saint Petersburg and who had immigrated to the United States in 1891. Ira's siblings were George (Jacob, b. 1898), Arthur (b. 1900), and Frances (b. 1906). Morris changed the family name to \"Gershwine\" (or alternatively \"Gershvin\") well before their children rose to fame; it was not spelled \"Gershwin\" until later. Shy in his youth, Ira spent much of his time at home reading, but from grammar school through college, he played a prominent part in several school newspapers and magazines.\nHe graduated in 1914 from Townsend Harris High School, a public school for intellectually gifted students, where he met Yip Harburg, with whom he enjoyed a lifelong friendship and a love of Gilbert and Sullivan. He attended the City College of New York but dropped out.The childhood home of Ira and George Gershwin was in the center of the Yiddish Theater District, on the second floor at 91 Second Avenue, between East 5th Street and East 6th Street. They frequented the local Yiddish theaters.While George began composing and \"plugging\" in Tin Pan Alley from the age of 18, Ira worked as a cashier in his father's Turkish baths. It was not until 1921 that Ira became involved in the music business. Alex Aarons signed Ira to write the songs for his next show, Two Little Girls in Blue, ultimately produced by Abraham Erlanger, along with co-composers Vincent Youmans and Paul Lannin. So as not to appear to trade off George's growing reputation, Ira wrote under the pseudonym \"Arthur Francis\", after his youngest two siblings. His lyrics were well received, allowing him successfully to enter the show-business world with just one show. Later the same year, the Gershwins collaborated for the first time on a score; this was for A Dangerous Maid, which played in Atlantic City and on tour.It was not until 1924 that Ira and George teamed up to write the music for what became their first Broadway hit Lady, Be Good. Once the brothers joined forces, their combined talents became one of the most influential forces in the history of American Musical Theatre. \"When the Gershwins teamed up to write songs for Lady, Be Good, the American musical found its native idiom.\" Together, they wrote the music for more than 12 shows and four films. Some of their more famous works include \"The Man I Love\", \"Fascinating Rhythm\", \"Someone to Watch Over Me\", \"I Got Rhythm\" and \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\". Their partnership continued until George's unexpected death from a brain tumor in 1937. Following his brother's death, Ira waited nearly three years before writing again.\nAfter this temporary retirement, Ira teamed up with accomplished composers such as Jerome Kern (Cover Girl); Kurt Weill (Where Do We Go from Here?; Lady in the Dark); Harry Warren (The Barkleys of Broadway); and Harold Arlen (Life Begins at 8:40; A Star Is Born). Over the next 14 years, Gershwin continued to write the lyrics for many film scores and a few Broadway shows. But the failure of Park Avenue in 1946 (a \"smart\" show about divorce, co-written with composer Arthur Schwartz) was his farewell to Broadway. As he wrote at the time, \"Am reading a couple of stories for possible musicalization (if there is such a word) but I hope I don't like them as I think I deserve a long rest.\"In 1947, he took 11 songs George had written but never used, provided them with new lyrics, and incorporated them into the Betty Grable film The Shocking Miss Pilgrim. He later wrote comic lyrics for Billy Wilder's 1964 movie Kiss Me, Stupid, although most critics believe his final major work was for the 1954 Judy Garland film A Star Is Born.American singer, pianist and musical historian Michael Feinstein worked for Gershwin in the lyricist's latter years, helping him with his archive. Several lost musical treasures were unearthed during this period, and Feinstein performed some of the material. Feinstein's book The Gershwins and Me: A Personal History in Twelve Songs about working for Ira, and George and Ira's music, was published in 2012.According to a 1999 story in Vanity Fair, Ira Gershwin's love for loud music was as great as his wife's loathing of it. When Debby Boone\u2014daughter-in-law of his neighbor Rosemary Clooney\u2014returned from Japan with one of the first Sony Walkmans (utilizing cassette tape), Clooney gave it to Michael Feinstein to give to Ira, \"so he could crank it in his ears, you know.

Among the leading French composers of his time, his work was rooted in the Impressionistic style of Debussy and Ravel, but in an idiosyncratic, individual style. Among his best known works are his early Flute Sonatine and Piano Sonata; concertos for cello, Tout un monde lointain... (\"A whole distant world\") and violin, L'arbre des songes (\"The tree of dreams\"); a string quartet known as Ainsi la nuit (\"Thus the night\"); and two symphonies: No. 1 (1951) and No. 2 Le Double (1959).Works were commissioned from him by such major artists as Charles Munch, George Szell, Mstislav Rostropovich, the Juilliard String Quartet, Isaac Stern, Paul Sacher, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Simon Rattle, Ren\u00e9e Fleming, and Seiji Ozawa. In addition to composing, he worked as the Head of Music Production for Radio France for 18 years. He also taught at the \u00c9cole Normale de Musique de Paris and at the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur de Musique, and was twice composer in residence at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts.\nAmong Dutilleux's many awards and honours were the Grand Prix de Rome (1938) and the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize (2005). When describing him, the music critic Paul Griffiths wrote that \"Mr. Dutilleux\u2019s position in French music was proudly solitary. Between Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez in age, he was little affected by either, though he took an interest in their work. But his voice, marked by sensuously handled harmony and color, was his own.\"", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40014", "text": "Dutilleux's music extends the legacies of French composers such as Debussy and Ravel but is also clearly influenced by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Igor Stravinsky. Among his favourite pieces, he mentioned Beethoven's late string quartets and Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande.His attitude toward serialism was ambiguous. While he always paid attention to developments in contemporary music and incorporated some serialist techniques into his work, he also criticized the more radical and intolerant aspects of the movement: \"What I reject is the dogma and the authoritarianism which manifested themselves in that period.\" Dutilleux refused to be associated with any school.Dutilleux's music contains distant echoes of jazz, as can be heard in the plucked double bass strings at the beginning of his First Symphony and his frequent use of syncopated rhythms. He often calls for Ray Robinson-style cup mutes in the brass section, which seems to indicate the influence of big band music. Dutilleux was greatly enamoured of vocalists, especially the jazz singer Sarah Vaughan and the great French chanson singers.Some of Dutilleux's trademarks include very refined orchestral textures; complex rhythms; a preference for atonality and modality over tonality; the use of pedal points that serve as atonal pitch centers; and \"reverse variation\", whereby a theme is revealed gradually, appearing in its complete form only after a few partial, tentative expositions. His music also displays a strong sense of structure and symmetry. This is particularly obvious from an \"external\" point of view, in the overall organisation of the different movements or the spatial distribution of the various instruments, but is also apparent in the music itself (themes, harmonies and rhythms mirroring, complementing or opposing each other). According to Stuart Jefferies, \"A passage may be conceived as a symmetrical shape of notes on paper and only later given musical substance. He loves symmetrical musical figures such as palindromes or fan-shaped phrases\".Dutilleux's music was influenced by art and literature, such as the works of Vincent van Gogh, Charles Baudelaire and Marcel Proust. It also shows a concern for the concepts of time and memory, both in its use of quotations (notably from Bart\u00f3k, Benjamin Britten, and Jehan Alain), and in short interludes that recall material used in earlier movements and/or introduce ideas that will be fully developed later.\nA perfectionist with a strong sense of artistic integrity, he allowed only a small number of his works to be published; what he did publish he often repeatedly revised. In his own words:\n\nI always doubt my work. I always have regrets. That's why I revise my work so much and, at the same time, I regret not being more prolific. But the reason I am not more prolific is because I doubt my work and spend a lot of time changing it.

Ports were developed and released for Microsoft Windows in April 2009, Mac OS X in May 2009, PlayStation 3 in November 2009, and Linux in December 2010. Jonathan Blow designed the game as a personal critique of contemporary trends in video game development. He self-funded the three-year project, working with webcomic artist David Hellman to develop the artwork. An anniversary version is planned for release for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Mobile, Windows, Mac, and Linux with updated graphics and developer commentary.\nThe basic story elements in Braid unfold as the protagonist, Tim, attempts to rescue a princess from a monster. Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative, giving clues about Tim's contemplations and motivations. The game features traditionally defining aspects of the platform genre while also integrating various novel powers of time-manipulation. Using these abilities, the player progresses through the game by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces.\nA preliminary version of Braid (without the final artwork) won the \"Innovation in Game Design\" award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival, while the final version received additional accolades. The game received critical acclaim, praising the mechanics, puzzles, graphics and soundtrack, but criticized the game's price relative to its length of play, eventually becoming the highest rated title on Xbox Live, and considered as one of the greatest video games ever made. It is seen as a keystone title in the growth of indie game development, and Blow and its production were documented in the 2012 film, Indie Game: The Movie. The game had total revenue nearing $6 million, as of 2015, which Blow used to fund his next game, The Witness, a 3D puzzle game released in 2016.\nA 15th Anniversary Edition of Braid, featuring remastered visuals and audio along with director's commentary, is scheduled for release in April 2024.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40648", "text": "Antigama is a Polish grindcore band.

I like sounds that relate to humanity, like Sufi music.\" Accordingly, several songs in the album have noticeably spiritual and devotional overtones.\"Khaireyan De Naal\" was the lead single and opening track on Tabeer and was used heavily to promote the album across music channels in both India and Pakistan. Ali borrowed the primary chorus line of the song from Tufail Niazi's folk song of the same name and wrote and composed the song around it. The song tells the story of the tragic romance of Heer Ranjha, a Punjabi folktale written in 1766 by the poet Waris Shah. Ali received significant critical acclaim for \"Khaireyan De Naal\" and has mentioned that it is his favorite track in the album. He also composed and sang a version of this song for the soundtrack of the 2015 Hindi movie, Tevar.The album has strong Sufi overtones and features five Sufi tracks \u2013 \"Rang Le,\" \"Bulleh Shah,\" \"Dum Ali Ali Dum,\" \"Rohi,\" and \"Pagalpan\":\n\n\"Rang Le\" is based on the well-known Sufi devotional song, Mohe Apne Hi Rang Mein Rang De, written by Sufi poet Amir Khusrau as a supplication to his spiritual guide \u2014 the Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya \u2014 beseeching him to dye Khusrau in the colors of divine love. The theme of immersive colors, dyes, and hues is a prominent motif in Sufi poetry and imagery and symbolizes union and oneness between the seeker and God (as the Beloved). Ali incorporated guitar- and accordion-led jazz improvisations into his arrangement of this track to lend it softer, romantic tones.\nThe song \"Bulleh Shah\" is based on the Sufi devotional Kafi Aao Saiyo Ral Deo Ni Wadhai written by the 18th-century poet and philosopher, Bulleh Shah, in which he celebrates the ecstasy of finding his murshid (spiritual teacher) \u2013 the Sufi saint Shah Inayat Qadiri. Ali chose to name the song eponymously in honor of its writer. He also performed a version of this song for Season 2 of MTV Unplugged in 2012.\nAli composed and wrote additional lyrics for the track \"Dum Ali Ali Dum\" which is a variation of the popular 600-year-old qawwali, \"Dama Dam Mast Qalandar,\" originally written by Amir Khusrau and modified further by Bulleh Shah. The song is a much-celebrated and widely-sung tribute to the Sufi mystic and saint Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and is part of the Indian subcontinent's cultural zeitgeist.\n\"Rohi\" is an adaptation of a Kafi titled \"Jindri Luti Te Yaar Sajan\" (also known as \"Dilri Luti Te Yaar Sajan\") written by the 19th-Century Sufi poet Khwaja Ghulam Farid. The Kafi was originally sung by Zahida Parveen, and various renditions of it have also been performed by Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Pathanay Khan, Mehdi Hassan, and Abida Parveen among others. The original verses are written in the little-known Saraiki dialect from a remote region of Pakistan, which led Ali to alter some of the lyrics to make the song easier to understand. He also modified the composition of the original song to render it in a more contemporary style while retaining the traditional folk sounds of the original.\n\"Pagalpan\" is inspired by Sindhi folk music and plays with the familiar Sufi theme of seeking a path to God and enlightenment while also acknowledging that God is within oneself.The song \"Kartar,\" set in raga Darbari, is based on a time-honored Patiala Gharana bandish, originally sung by Ali's father Ustad Amanat Ali Khan and uncle Ustad Bade Fateh Ali Khan. Ali described the track as an \"old traditional family song\" and has shared that he extended the sthayi of the original bandish to develop it into a song. In 2009, Ali delivered a live performance of \"Ajab Khail\" \u2014 a modified rendition of \"Kartar\" \u2014 for Season 2 of Coke Studio Pakistan, produced by Rohail Hyatt. \"Kartar\" is particularly noted for its rock riffs and high-octane orchestration, and it was featured again as a bonus track in Ali's second solo album, Kyun Dooriyan (2010), with a slightly different arrangement.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_38902", "text": "Rosario Di Bella (born 27 July 1963) is an Italian composer, singer-songwriter, music arranger and musician.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Abshire began performing in public on the accordion when he was eight years old and he was considered to be an \"accomplished musician\"; he'd learned to play on an accordion that cost him $3.50.He was also influenced by the musician Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Ardoin. In an interview, Abshire said, \"Every Saturday afternoon some years ago, we used to go to John Foreman's saloon. I'd see Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Ardoin coming full-stride down the way. He'd say, \"Abshire, you've got to help me tonight.\"Abshire played with fiddler Lionel Leleux, who he also was taught by, and the accordion player Ardoin during the 1930s. He and the Rayne-Bo Ramblers, with the band leader being Leroy \"Happy Fats\" Leblanc,  performed six songs in 1935, with Abshire being listed in the credits as \"Nason Absher\". He also played with the Rayne-Bo Ramblers again in the 1960s.Abshire was a member the U.S. Army and was in World War II which stopped him from playing the accordion. He was discharged from the military after he broke his leg while training. His time in the army inspired Abshire to write the crooner song \"Service Blues\", which the newspaper Daily World reported as \"one of his most memorable tearjerkers\"; in \"Service Blues\", \"Abshire crooned about waiting alone at the train station, set to leave all that he loved in Louisiana\".Abshire moved to Basile, Louisiana after his time in the war and he performed at the Avalon Club often. His better known record titled \"Pine Grove Blues\" was released in 1949, a song based on Amede Breaux's \"Le Blues de Petit Chien\", as well as several releases on Swallow Records and Arhoolie Records during the 1960s.  He appeared with Dewey Balfa and The Balfa Brothers at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964. Abshire's music became more well known outside of Louisiana at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival. Along with Balfa, Abshire devoted much of his time in the 1960s and 70s to promoting Cajun music through appearances at festivals, colleges, and schools throughout the United States.At some point, Abshire received an offer to perform with Hank Williams (he declined). In 1970, Abshire played with the Balfa Brothers at the University of Iowa in Iowa City , Iowa. It was their first tour and they wanted to \"prove that Cajun music still exists - in its traditional form - and to save what's left\".Abshire was unable to write so he was unable to sign autographs, resulting in him having to politely decline the requests.

Abshire considered his inability to do those things as frustrating and humiliating. Abshire learned how to write a signature from Barry Jean Ancelet and his signature used \"stick figure letters\" to sign \"N A\". Abshire also used the signature for legal documents.Despite receiving more income from music than the majority of Cajun musicians, Abshire was not able to entirely depend on that income to live on. Abshire had multiple jobs during his life and his final job was working as the custodian of the town's landfill. He took used objects from his yard to sell on his front porch.Abshire was a main feature in a 1971 documentary titled Spend It All which was directed by Les Blank, as well as being featured in a 1975 documentary from PBS titled The Good Times Are Killing Me.

Abshire's funeral service was held at St. Augustine Catholic Church in Basile. He was buried in the church's cemetery. Abshire said prior to his death, \"When I die, I wish they would break all my records and not play them anymore. It doesn't feel right for the radios and everyone to keep on playing a musician's music after he's gone.\" Abshire also wanted his music to be buried with him, but that never happened. A benefit was held for Abshire's family on June 28, 1981, in which multiple Cajun musicians performed. A benefit dance was held at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Basile and the musicians that played during the dance changed each hour.In September 1981, a commemorative print of Abshire performing live was sold in The Kinder Courier News. There were 350 pen and ink prints available that could be framed. The Louisiana newspaper Basile Weekly said in 1983, \"Despite the efforts of many this great Cajun musician fell short of receiving the recognition and credit due him for his contributions to Cajun music and the preservation of our Acadian Culture\". A tribute was held for Abshire on August 21, 1983, in Basile, Louisiana at the city park. Performers played music during the tribute. Basile mayor Joe Toups proclaimed August 21, 1983 as Nathan Abshire day for his work in preserving Acadian culture. In 1984, a book titled The Makers of Cajun Music featured Abshire among the musicians. In 1983, Abshire's wife refused to have his accordion on display at the Smithsonian Institution.In 1995, the newspaper Daily World said, \"Bands are still recording Abshire's signature tune, \"The Pine Grove Blues\", which has also become a favorite among line dancers. Other songs like \"The Bayou Teche Waltz\", \"French Blues\", \"Belezare's Waltz\" and \"The Chopique Two Step\" remain top favorites\". In 1995, a show on KSLO (AM) titled \"The Yamland Fais Do Do\" played much of Abshire's music.

Their music was initially grounded in the rock of the 1960s, especially the acid rock and psychedelic rock movements. The band played Donovan's \"Get Thy Bearings\" in concert, and were known to play the Beatles' \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" in their rehearsals. However, for their own compositions, King Crimson (unlike the rock bands that had come before them) largely stripped away the blues-based foundations of rock music and replaced them with influences derived from classical composers. The first incarnation of King Crimson played the Mars section of Gustav Holst's suite The Planets live and later the band used Mars as a foundation for the song \"Devil's Triangle\". As a result of this influence, In the Court of the Crimson King is frequently viewed as the nominal starting point of the progressive rock movements. King Crimson also initially displayed strong jazz influences, most obviously on its signature track \"21st Century Schizoid Man\". The band also drew on English folk music for compositions such as \"Moonchild\" and \"I Talk to the Wind.\" In the 1972 lineup, Fripp's intention was to combine the music of Jimi Hendrix, Igor Stravinsky and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k.The 1981 reunion of the band brought in even more elements, displaying the influence of funk, post-punk, new wave, gamelan music and late 20th century classical composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley. For its 1994 reunion, King Crimson reassessed both the mid-1970s and 1980s approaches in the light of new technology, intervening music forms such as electronica, drum'n'bass and techno; and further developments in industrial music, as well as expanding the band's ambient textural content via Fripp's Soundscapes looping approach.\nThe 2013 version of the band returned, for the most part, to the band's 1960s and 1970s influences and repertoire but addressed them via current technology and rearrangements suited to a larger ensemble of more experienced musicians, while also incorporating the New Standard Tuning used by Fripp since 1984.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40224", "text": "King Crimson have been influential both on the early 1970s progressive rock movement and numerous contemporary artists. Genesis and Yes were directly influenced by the band's usage of the mellotron, and many King Crimson band members were involved in other notable bands: Bruford in Yes; Lake in Emerson, Lake & Palmer; McDonald in Foreigner; Burrell in Bad Company, and Wetton in U.K. and Asia. Canadian rock band Rush's drummer Neil Peart credited the adventurous and innovative style of Michael Giles as an influence on his own approach to percussion.King Crimson's influence extends to many bands from diverse genres, especially of the 1990s and 2000s. Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana, had stated that the album Red had a major influence on the sound of their final studio album In Utero. Tool are known to be heavily influenced by King Crimson, with vocalist Maynard James Keenan joking on a tour with them: \"Now you know who we ripped off. Just don't tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson.\" Modern progressive, experimental, psychedelic and indie rock bands have cited them as an influence as well, including the Mars Volta, Primus, Mystery Jets, Fanfarlo, Phish, and Anekdoten, who first practiced together playing King Crimson songs. Steven Wilson, the leader of Porcupine Tree, was responsible for remixing King Crimson's back catalogue in surround sound and said that the process had an enormous influence on his solo albums, and his band was influenced by King Crimson. In November 2012 the Flaming Lips in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs released a track-by-track reinterpretation of In the Court of the Crimson King entitled Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn. Colin Newman, of Wire, said he saw King Crimson perform many times, and that they influenced him deeply. The seminal hardcore punk group Black Flag acknowledge Wetton-era King Crimson as an influence on their experimental period in the mid-1980s. Melvin Gibbs said that the Rollins Band was influenced most by King Crimson, using similar chords. Bad Religion cites the lyrics of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" on their single \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\" and the name of their record label, Epitaph (founded by their guitarist Brett Gurewitz), comes from the song of the same name on Crimson's debut album. Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid considered Robert Fripp as one of his guitar influences.King Crimson have frequently been cited as pioneers of progressive metal and as an influence on bands of this genre, including Opeth, Mastodon, Between the Buried and Me, Leprous, Haken, the Ocean, Caligula's Horse, Last Chance to Reason, and Indukti. Members of metal bands Mudvayne, Voivod, Enslaved, Yob, Pyrrhon, and Pallbearer have cited King Crimson as an influence. Heavy experimental and avant-garde acts like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Neurosis, Zeni Geva, Ancestors, and Oranssi Pazuzu all cite King Crimson's influence.\nOther artists affected by King Crimson include video game composer Nobuo Uematsu, noise music artist Masami Akita of Merzbow, jazz guitarist Dennis Rea of Land, folktronica exponent Juana Molina, hip hop producer RJD2, hip hop and soul composer Adrian Younge, film director Hal Hartley, and folk-pop singer Ian Kelly.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40222", "text": "King Crimson were  an English progressive rock band formed in 1968 in London. The band drew inspiration from a wide variety of music, incorporating elements of classical, jazz, folk, heavy metal, gamelan, blues, industrial, electronic, experimental music and new wave. They exerted a strong influence on the early 1970s progressive rock movement, including on contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis, and continue to inspire subsequent generations of artists across multiple genres. The band earned a large cult following.Founded by Robert Fripp, Michael Giles, Greg Lake, Ian McDonald and Peter Sinfield, the band initially focused on a dramatic sound layered with Mellotron, McDonald's saxophone and flute, and Lake's bass and powerful lead vocals. Their debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969), remains their most commercially successful and influential release, with a potent mixture of jazz, classical and experimental music. Following the sudden simultaneous departures of McDonald and Giles, with Lake also leaving very shortly afterwards, the next two albums In the Wake of Poseidon and Lizard (both 1970) were recorded during a period of instability in the band's line-up. A settled band of Fripp, Sinfield, Mel Collins, Boz Burrell and Ian Wallace recorded Islands in 1971, though in mid-1972, Fripp let go of this line-up and changed the group's instrumentation and approach, drawing from European free improvisation and developing ever more complex compositions. With Bill Bruford, John Wetton, David Cross and, briefly, Jamie Muir, they reached what some saw as a creative peak on Larks' Tongues in Aspic (1973), Starless and Bible Black (1974), and Red (1974). King Crimson disbanded at the end of 1974.\nAfter seven years of inactivity, King Crimson was reborn in 1981 with another change in musical direction. The new band comprised Fripp, Bruford and new members Adrian Belew and Tony Levin. They drew influence from African music, gamelan, post-punk and New York minimalism. This band lasted three years, resulting in the trio of albums Discipline (1981), Beat (1982) and Three of a Perfect Pair (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, they reformed in 1994, adding Pat Mastelotto and Trey Gunn for a sextet line-up Fripp called \"The Double Trio\". The double trio participated in another three-year cycle of activity that included the release of Thrak (1995), and multiple concert recordings. There was a hiatus between 1997 and 2000. Four members of the double trio reunited in 2000 as a more industrial-oriented King Crimson, called \"The Double Duo\", releasing The Construkction of Light (2000) and The Power to Believe (2003). After a five-year hiatus, the group expanded (in the person of new second drummer Gavin Harrison) for a 2008 tour celebrating the 40th anniversary of their 1968 formation.\nFollowing another hiatus (2009\u20132012), during which Fripp was thought to be retired, King Crimson came together again in 2013; this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline, and new second guitarist and singer Jakko Jakszyk. This version of King Crimson continued to tour from 2014 to 2021, and released multiple live albums.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Juvet began studying piano at age 7; later he developed an interest in the music of The Beatles.Juvet moved to Paris in 1968 at the age of 18 with little money. A friend encouraged him to become a model in Germany, and Juvet pursued this career in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, for two years. He returned to Paris in 1970.In Saint-Tropez he met French music producer Eddie Barclay, who allowed him to record a first single in 1971. He wrote \"Le Lundi au soleil\", sung by Claude Fran\u00e7ois. Later, Juvet began collaborating with French composer and musician Jean-Michel Jarre with this new material featured on Juvet's album, Love, which was released in 1973. Juvet represented Switzerland at the Eurovision Song Contest 1973 with \"Je vais me marier, Marie,\" placing at no. 12 in the competition.In 1977, Juvet collaborated again with Jarre on the French-language album, Paris by Night, which featured the hit song, \"O\u00f9 sont les femmes?\" In 1978, he worked with noted disco producers Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo, who also produced Village People and The Ritchie Family, among other acts. As a result, Juvet soon experienced international success with the disco tracks, \"Got a Feeling\" and \"I Love America\".In 1978, the aforementioned \"O\u00f9 sont les femmes?\" was re-recorded in English under the title, \"Where Is My Woman?\", and was featured on Juvet's English-language debut on Casablanca Records in the U.S. Victor Willis, original lead singer of Village People, was the lyricist for the project.His soundtrack score to David Hamilton's art house film Laura featured disco musicians Marc Chantereau and Slim Pezin of Voyage and Space session bassist Jannick Top.

His childhood home was at 225 Triunvirato, later renumbered and renamed as 4943 Corrientes, opposite the theater Florencio S\u00e1nchez. Immersed since childhood in the theatrical environment and in the emerging world of radio, at fourteen he decided not to study further, a decision that earned him being thrown out of the house by his parents. He moved to El Centro area of Buenos Aires.\nLinking his fate to that of Carlos Gardel began in 1933 when he was presented as a performance artist speaker at the Nacional theater. In 1934, Nelson began broadcasting his Buenos Aires radio program \"Escuche esta Noche a Gardel\" (\"Listen tonight to Gardel\"), trying to keep alive the public's interest in Gardel, who was killed on June 24, 1935 in an accidental airplane crash in Medell\u00edn.  \nSoon after, on Radio Callao, opened in January of that year, the announcer Carlos Enrique Cecchetti began broadcasting a program fully devoted to Gardel. Nelson continued that program beginning in 1936, inaugurating the show \"El Bronce que Sonr\u00ede\" (\"The smiling bronze\"). This program moved in 1944 to Radio Mitre. Each daily program started with this saying: \"Through time and distance his name endures as the truest symbol of our arts. Carlos Gardel, the smiling bronze.\" Gardel's remains were returned from Colombia on 5 February 1936. Nelson broadcast a program from Gardel's gravesite in Chacarita Cemetery.\nAnother day radio program which gave Nelson great popularity was \"El Exito de Cada Orquesta\" (The Success of Every Orchestra), which was broadcast from Radio Callao (the station that also directed \"La Pandilla Coraz\u00f3n\") and then transferred to Radio Mitre and finally Radio Rivadavia. Knowing the value of ritual formulae, Nelson concluded each program with the same farewell: \"See you tomorrow, if God permits.\" Both programs remained stubbornly on the air long after radio stations had started to thin out their tango programming.\nIn 1936, he married Margarita Ibarrola Isaurralde when she was 17, but they separated in 1945, leaving his 7-year-old son, Julio Carlos (nicknamed \"Cachito\") with the boy's paternal grandparents. Margarita migrated to Brazil, where she married a German and had two children with him but again separated. Eventually all contact was lost. \nJulio then married Susana Carballo in 1951; she was a female tango singer known as Susana Ocampo. That marriage lasted only a year and half. They separated then, but no formal divorce. After Nelson's death, Susana became his heir.\nOne day, at age 14, Nelson's son escaped from the grandparents' house, leaving a letter in which he explained to them that he was going south. The truth was that he was going to Guayaquil, Ecuador with two friends. In Bolivia, they were arrested, but managed to continue traveling on a group passport. Nelson's son found employment at Club Barcelona. At that time, Tucho M\u00e9ndez, a friend of Julio Jorge and aware of the disappearance of Julio's child, recognized his son with great surprise. He immediately phoned Buenos Aires, and shortly after, via a link to a radio Guayaquil, Julio, asked the son to come back home. His son returned.\nJulio died on 6 March 1976, aged 62, four days after suffering a heart attack.\nJulio Jorge Nelson wrote several tangos that enjoyed success. By far, the most successful was \"Margarita Gauthier\" with music by the talented Joaqu\u00edn Mora. This tango was recorded by Alberto G\u00f3mez in 1935, but truly became famous due to the  version of Miguel Cal\u00f3 with Raul Beron, in 1942, which was followed by An\u00edbal Troilo with Fiorentino, in 1943.  \nNelson was also the author of the tangos \"Carriego\u201d, \u201c\u00d3yeme, mam\u00e1\u201d, \u201cQu\u00e9 ser\u00e1 de ti\u201d, \u201cNo debemos retornar\u201d, \u201cNocturno de tango\u201d, \u201cLa casa vac\u00eda\u201d, \u201cEscuchando tu voz\u201d, \u201cAl volverte a ver\u201d, \u201cJunto al piano\u201d, \u201cCuento azul\u201d, and \u201cDerrotao\u201d, among others. \nNelson also had two forays into film, \"Historia de un \u00cddolo\" and \"Soy del Tiempo de Gardel\", about a time which he more than anyone else celebrated.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to Rudd, the idea of forming a new quartet originated with Tchicai, and the two began playing in filmmaker Michael Snow's loft space with Moore and Moses. Moses soon left as a result of mutual dissatisfaction with his role, and Rudd and Tchicai were soon introduced to drummer Milford Graves by saxophonist Giuseppi Logan. Tchicai recalled: \"this was a very pleasant surprise and more than that, because Graves simply baffled both Rudd and I in that we, at that time, hadn't heard anybody of the younger musicians in New York that had the same sense of rhythmic cohesion in poly-rhythmics or the same sense of intensity and musicality.\" Graves \"wound up playing with them for half an hour, astonishing Rudd and Tchicai, who promptly invited him to join what became The New York Art Quartet\". Graves later stated that his invitation to join the group came \"at a time when the evolutive phases of my spiritual and creative potential were in need of being expressed without limitation\". However, Tchicai also recalled that \"bassist Don Moore became so frightened of this wizard of a percussionist that he decided that this couldn't be true or possible and, therefore, refused to play with us\", and the group brought in bassist Lewis Worrell in his place.In July 1964, Tchicai and Rudd briefly joined Albert Ayler's quartet, which consisted of Ayler, Cherry, Gary Peacock, and Sunny Murray, to record New York Eye and Ear Control, the soundtrack for a film by Michael Snow. That fall, the NYAQ, calling themselves \"The John Tchicai Quartet\", played their debut concert, participating in the \"October Revolution in Jazz\" organized by Bill Dixon. In November, the NYAQ recorded their first album as part of ESP Disk's original roster of jazz artists, and a month later they performed at the Dixon-organized festival \"Four Days in December\" as the \"Roswell Rudd - John Tchicai Quartet\", playing opposite Sun Ra at Judson Hall. The group's second album, Mohawk, was recorded in July 1965 with Reggie Workman on bass (Worrell left the group in December 1964), and was released on the Fontana label. In the fall of 1965, Tchicai lined up dates for the NYAQ in Copenhagen, Gothenburg (Sweden), Hilversum (Holland), and Amsterdam (where they opened for Ornette Coleman's group), with Finn Von Eyben playing bass and Louis Moholo playing drums as a result of scheduling issues with the original musicians. Recordings from this tour were issued on Roswell Rudd, released in 1971 without Rudd's consent, and in 2010 on the album Old Stuff. The group broke up in February 1966, with Tchicai returning to Denmark.On June 13, 1999, the NYAQ, with Workman on bass, reunited for a performance at the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, opening for Sonic Youth. Amiri Baraka, whose poem \"Black Dada Nihilismus\" was included on their debut album 35 years earlier, also appeared. The group recorded the album 35th Reunion  the following day. In 2000 they played the Paris Banlieues Blues Festival, followed by a performance at the Lisboa festival in 2001. In 2013, after Tchicai's death, Triple Point Records released a limited-edition five-LP box set, along with a 156-page coffee-table book and miscellaneous artifacts, entitled Call It Art.According to Tchicai, one of the most unique aspects of the NYAQ was \"the polyphonic part of the music that came into play; the whole collective style of playing that also existed in New Orleans Jazz and classical music. The polyphonic aspect of our music was something quite new compared to what other people were doing in contemporary jazz.\" David Toop described the group's signature sound as \"deliberately ragged, bleary themes tumbling out in spasms, notes tailing away as if lost to daydream, the music so open that total collapse seems perpetually imminent\". In his liner notes to Mohawk, Tchicai wrote: \"The important thing about our music is that it must be heard and listened to without preconceived ideas as to how jazz should sound \u2013 listen to it as MUSIC and let that be the only label!\"A documentary on the NYAQ, entitled The Breath Courses Through Us, was released in 2013 by director Alan Roth.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_54918", "text": "New York Days is an album by Italian jazz trumpeter and composer Enrico Rava recorded in February 2008 and released on ECM the following year.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "740_18910", "text": "The Candles are an American rock band formed in New York City in 2009.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Among the best-known are the piano suite Trois mouvements perp\u00e9tuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champ\u00eatre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the Organ Concerto (1938), the opera Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites (1957), and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir, and orchestra.\nAs the only son of a prosperous manufacturer, Poulenc was expected to follow his father into the family firm, and he was not allowed to enrol at a music college. He studied with the pianist Ricardo Vi\u00f1es, who became his mentor after the composer's parents died. Poulenc also made the acquaintance of Erik Satie, under whose tutelage he became one of a group of young composers known collectively as Les Six.

He toured in Europe and America with both of them, and made a number of recordings as a pianist. He was among the first composers to see the importance of the gramophone, and he recorded extensively from 1928 onwards.\nIn his later years, and for decades after his death, Poulenc had a reputation, particularly in his native country, as a humorous, lightweight composer, and his religious music was often overlooked.

In Henri Hell's view, this is because the main feature of Poulenc's musical art is his melodic gift. In the words of Roger Nichols in the Grove dictionary, \"For [Poulenc] the most important element of all was melody and he found his way to a vast treasury of undiscovered tunes within an area that had, according to the most up-to-date musical maps, been surveyed, worked and exhausted.\" The commentator George Keck writes, \"His melodies are simple, pleasing, easily remembered, and most often emotionally expressive.\"Poulenc said that he was not inventive in his harmonic language. The composer Lennox Berkeley wrote of him, \"All through his life, he was content to use conventional harmony, but his use of it was so individual, so immediately recognizable as his own, that it gave his music freshness and validity.\"  Keck considers Poulenc's harmonic language \"as beautiful, interesting and personal as his melodic writing ... clear, simple harmonies moving in obviously defined tonal areas with chromaticism that is rarely more than passing\". Poulenc had no time for musical theories; in one of his many radio interviews he called for \"a truce to composing by theory, doctrine, rule!\" He was dismissive of what he saw as the dogmatism of latter-day adherents to dodecaphony, led by Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz, and greatly regretted that the adoption of a theoretical approach had affected the music of Olivier Messiaen, of whom he had earlier had high hopes. To Hell, almost all Poulenc's music is \"directly or indirectly inspired by the purely melodic associations of the human voice\". Poulenc was a painstaking craftsman, though a myth grew up \u2013 \"la l\u00e9gende de facilit\u00e9\" \u2013 that his music came easily to him; he commented, \"The myth is excusable, since I do everything to conceal my efforts.\"The pianist Pascal Rog\u00e9 commented in 1999 that both sides of Poulenc's musical nature were equally important: \"You must accept him as a whole. If you take away either part, the serious or the non-serious, you destroy him. If one part is erased you get only a pale photocopy of what he really is.\" Poulenc recognised the dichotomy, but in all his works he wanted music that was \"healthy, clear and robust \u2013 music as frankly French as Stravinsky's is Slav\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40539", "text": "The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, \"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perp\u00e9tuels.\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites and Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias.\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

He received numerous accolades including the Grammy Award for Best Male Vocal Performance for Hello, Dolly! in 1965, as well as a posthumous win for the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972, and induction into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2017.Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. Around 1922, he followed his mentor, Joe \"King\" Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. He earned a reputation at \"cutting contests\", and his fame reached band leader Fletcher Henderson. He moved to New York City, where he became a featured and musically influential band soloist and recording artist. By the 1950s, he was a national musical icon, appearing regularly in radio and television broadcasts and on film.\nHis best known songs include \"What a Wonderful World\", \"La Vie en Rose\", \"Hello, Dolly!\", \"On the Sunny Side of the Street\", \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\", \"When You're Smiling\" and \"When the Saints Go Marching In\". He collaborated with Ella Fitzgerald, producing three records together: Ella and Louis (1956), Ella and Louis Again (1957), and Porgy and Bess (1959). He also appeared in films such as A Rhapsody in Black and Blue (1932), Cabin in the Sky (1943), High Society (1956), Paris Blues (1961), A Man Called Adam (1966), and Hello, Dolly! (1969).\nWith his instantly recognizable rich, gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser. He was also skilled at scat singing. By the end of Armstrong's life, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\" to wide popularity with White and international audiences. He rarely publicly discussed racial issues, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation in the Little Rock crisis.

Although the English ladies of the ensemble are lovely, the tunes quite acceptable and Mr. Jack Buchanan an able and versatile performer, the film never comes off as musical comedy. Those song-and-dance interludes during which Mr. Buchanan abandons his money-spending campaign are useful chiefly to remind the audience that \"Brewster's Millions\" is still a sufficiently sturdy comedy to stand on its own feet. When the piece is being played straight, it is always bright and amusing in a slightly desperate British style...Mr. Buchanan is an engagingly frantic Brewster and he is assisted pleasantly enough by Lili Damita as the malicious chorus girl who wants to snare him and by Nancy O'Neil as his conservative sweetheart. But \"Brewster's Millions\" is more hilarious in theory than in practice in this British rendition\"; while TV Guide noted, \"the witty, energetic Buchanan has a field day with this craftily scripted comedy. The over-produced musical numbers and the elaborate Italian fiesta scenes are delights, as is every scene of this classic example of British wit.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_24210", "text": "Cash Box said that \"there's a spicy drum effect at the very end of this rockin', hit single,\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was the directorial debut of Alexander Mackendrick; the screenplay was by Compton Mackenzie, an adaptation of his 1947 novel Whisky Galore, and Angus MacPhail. The story\u2014based on a true event, the running aground of the SS Politician\u2014concerns a shipwreck off a fictional Scottish island, the inhabitants of which have run out of whisky because of wartime rationing. The islanders find out the ship is carrying 50,000 cases of whisky, some of which they salvage, against the opposition of the local Customs and Excise men.\nIt was filmed on the island of Barra; the weather was so poor that the production over-ran its 10-week schedule by five weeks, and the film went \u00a320,000 over budget. Michael Balcon, the head of the studio, was unimpressed by the initial cut of the film, and one of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added footage and re-edited the film before its release. Like other Ealing comedies, Whisky Galore! explores the actions of a small insular group facing and overcoming a more powerful opponent. An unspoken sense of community runs through the film, and the story reflects a time when the British Empire was weakening.\nWhisky Galore! was well received on release. It came out in the same year as Passport to Pimlico and Kind Hearts and Coronets, leading to 1949 being remembered as one of the peak years of the Ealing comedies. In the US, where Whisky Galore! was renamed Tight Little Island, the film became the first from the studios to achieve box office success. It was followed by a sequel, Rockets Galore!. Whisky Galore! has since been adapted for the stage, and a remake was released in 2016.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6370", "text": "All music written, composed & arranged by Aunty Disco Project.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40837", "text": "Whisky Galore! primarily centres on the conflict between two men, Macroon and Waggett; women have what McArthur describes as \"peripheral roles\". Much of the film's humour is at the expense of Waggett, and the film historian Mark Duguid considers there is a \"cruel bite\" to it. Waggett is described by the cultural historian Roger Rawlings as a fish-out-of-water on Todday; he is the intruder in a film that contains what the film historian Christine Geraghty describes as \"a narrative of rural resistance\". Not all outsiders to the island are intruders: the other Englishman, Sergeant Odd, \"acts as the audience's entry point into the community\", and immerses himself in the island's ways. Whisky Galore! is one of several films that show an outsider coming to Scotland and being \"either humiliated or rejuvenated (or both)\", according to David Martin-Jones, the film historian.Jonny Murray, the film and visual culture academic, considers the Scottish characters in the film as stereotypes: \"the slightly drunk, slightly unruly local, the figures who are magically cut adrift or don't seem to respect at all the conventions of how we live in the modern world\". He likens the film's portrayals of the Scots to the portrayals in the Kailyard school of literature, which represents a false image of Scotland. The film historian Claire Mortimer sees the Western Isles as portrayed as \"being a magical space which is outside of time and the 'real' world\". This is true of both Whisky Galore! and Mackendrick's other Scottish-based Ealing comedy, The Maggie. Both films evoke \"a tension between myth and reality in the portrayal of the idyllic island community\".McArthur, in his work comparing Whisky Galore! to The Maggie, identifies what he sees as \"the Scottish Discursive Unconscious\" running through the film: an examination of the ethnicity of \"the Scots (in particular the Gaelic-Speaking, Highland Scots) as having an essential identity different from\u2014indeed, in many respects the antithesis of\u2014the Anglo-Saxon identified by (a certain class of) Englishmen\". According to McArthur, this view of the Scots has permeated much of British culture, influenced by Sir Walter Scott, Felix Mendelssohn, James Macpherson, Sir Edwin Landseer, Sir Harry Lauder and Queen Victoria. The critic John Brown argues that the film, created by outsiders to the community, tries to \"embody some kind of definitive essence\", but fails to do so, although the result is not unsympathetic.According to Daubney, the islanders \"relish their isolation and simple way of life and go to considerable lengths to protect it against a moral code imposed from outside\". An unspoken sense of community runs through the film, according to Geraghty, such as in salvaging the whisky, and particularly in the r\u00e8iteach scene; immediately coming from that celebration, the islanders come together to hide the whisky when they hear the customs men are on their way. Martin-Jones\u2014describing the scene as a c\u00e8ilidh\u2014considers that it offers a Kailyard image which \"illustrates the curative charms Scotland offers to the tourist or visiting outsider\".Mackendrick's biographer, Philip Kemp, identifies different strands of comedy, including what he describes as \"crude incongruity\", \"verbal fencing\u2014beautifully judged by the actors no less than the director in its underplayed humour\" and \"near-surreal\" conversations. Martin-Jones sees such flexibility in approach as a method to allow important points in the plot to make themselves apparent.The film historians Anthony Aldgate and Jeffrey Richards describe Whisky Galore! as a progressive comedy because it upsets the established social order to promote the well-being of a community. In this, and in the rejection of the colonial power by a small community, Aldgate and Richards compare the film to Passport to Pimlico. The device of pitting a small group of British against a series of changes to the status quo from an external agent leads the British Film Institute to consider Whisky Galore!, along with other of the Ealing comedies, as \"conservative, but 'mildly anarchic' daydreams, fantasies\". Like other Ealing comedies, Whisky Galore! concerned the actions of a small insular group facing and overcoming a more powerful opponent. The film historian George Perry writes that in doing so the film examines \"dogged team spirit, the idiosyncrasies of character blended and harnessed for the good of the group\". Like Passport to Pimlico, Whisky Galore! \"portrays a small populace closing ranks around their esoteric belief system that English law cannot completely contain\". Along with the other Ealing comedies, this rejection of power and law reflects a time when the British Empire was weakening.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was noted for his rich, almost operatic bass-baritone voice. In 2019, Eckstine was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award \"for performers who, during their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording.\" His recording of \"I Apologize\" (MGM, 1951) was given the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999. The New York Times described him as an \"influential band leader\" whose \"suave bass-baritone\" and \"full-throated, sugary approach to popular songs inspired singers like Earl Coleman, Johnny Hartman, Joe Williams, Arthur Prysock, and Lou Rawls.\"", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40907", "text": "Heading to Chicago, Illinois, Eckstine joined Earl Hines' Grand Terrace Orchestra in 1939, staying with the band as vocalist and trumpeter until 1943. By that time, Eckstine had begun to make a name for himself through the Hines band's juke-box hits, such as \"Stormy Monday Blues\", and his own \"Jelly, Jelly\".\nIn 1944, Eckstine formed his own big band, and it became the finishing school for adventurous young musicians who would shape the future of jazz including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Gene Ammons, Miles Davis, Art Blakey, Cecil Payne, Fats Navarro, Lucky Thompson, John Malachi, Sarah Vaughan, Pearl Bailey, and Lena Horne. Tadd Dameron, Gil Fuller and Jerry Valentine were among the band's arrangers. The Billy Eckstine Orchestra is considered to be the first bebop big-band, and had Top Ten chart entries that included \"A Cottage for Sale\" and \"Prisoner of Love\". Both were awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.Dizzy Gillespie, in reflecting on the band in his 1979 autobiography To Be or Not to Bop, gives this perspective: \"There was no band that sounded like Billy Eckstine's. Our attack was strong, and we were playing bebop, the modern style. No other band like this one existed in the world.\" In 1946 Eckstine starred as the hero in the musical film Rhythm in a Riff, which also starred Ann Baker and Lucky Millinder.Eckstine became a solo performer in 1947, with records featuring lush, sophisticated orchestrations. Even before folding his band, Eckstine had recorded solo to support it, scoring two million-sellers in 1945 with \"Cottage for Sale\" and a revival of \"Prisoner of Love\". Far more successful than his band recordings, these prefigured Eckstine's future career. Eckstine would go on to record over a dozen hits during the late 1940s. He signed with the newly established MGM Records, and had immediate hits with revivals of \"Everything I Have Is Yours\" (1947), Rodgers and Hart's \"Blue Moon\" (1948), and Juan Tizol's \"Caravan\" (1949).\nEckstine had further success in 1950 with Victor Young's theme song to \"My Foolish Heart,\" and the next year with a revival of the 1931 Bing Crosby hit, \"I Apologize\".His 1950 appearance at the Paramount Theatre in New York City, drew a larger audience than Frank Sinatra at his Paramount performance.Eckstine was the subject of a three-page profile in the April 24, 1950 issue of Life magazine, in which the photographer Martha Holmes accompanied Eckstine and his entourage during a week in New York City. One photograph taken by Holmes and published in Life showed Eckstine with a group of white female admirers, one of whom had her hand on his shoulder and her head on his chest while she was laughing. Eckstine's biographer, Cary Ginell, wrote of the image that Holmes \"...captured a moment of shared exuberance, joy, and affection, unblemished by racial tension\". Holmes would later describe the photograph as the favorite of the many she had taken in her career as it \"...told just what the world should be like\". The photograph was considered so controversial that an editor at Life sought personal approval from Henry Luce, the magazine's publisher, who said it should be published. The publication of the image caused letters of protest to be written to the magazine, and singer Harry Belafonte subsequently said of the publication that \"When that photo hit, in this national publication, it was if a barrier had been broken\". The controversy that resulted from the photograph had a seminal effect on the trajectory of Eckstine's career. Tony Bennett would recall that \"It changed everything...Before that, he had a tremendous following...and it just offended the white community\", a sentiment shared by pianist Billy Taylor who said that the \"coverage and that picture just slammed the door shut for him\".In 1951, Eckstine performed at the seventh Cavalcade of Jazz concert held on July 8 at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. Also featured were Lionel Hampton and his Revue, Percy Mayfield, Jimmy Witherspoon, Joe Liggins and The Honeydrippers and Roy Brown.Among Eckstine's recordings of the 1950s was a 1957 duet with Sarah Vaughan, \"Passing Strangers\", a minor hit for them in 1957, but an initial No. 22 success in the UK Singles Chart.The 1960 Las Vegas live album, No Cover, No Minimum, featured Eckstine taking a few trumpet solos and showcasing his nightclub act. He recorded albums for Mercury and Roulette in the early 1960s and appeared on Motown albums during the mid to late years of the decade. After recording sparingly during the 1970s for Al Bell's Stax/Enterprise imprint, the international touring Eckstine made his last recording, the Grammy-nominated Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter in 1986.\nEckstine made numerous appearances on television variety shows, including on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Nat King Cole Show, The Tonight Show with Steve Allen, Jack Paar, and Johnny Carson, The Merv Griffin Show, The Art Linkletter Show, The Joey Bishop Show, The Dean Martin Show, The Flip Wilson Show, and Playboy After Dark. He also performed as an actor in the TV sitcom Sanford and Son, and in such films as Skirts Ahoy, Let's Do It Again, and Jo Jo Dancer. He performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" prior to Game 4 of the 1979 World Series at Three Rivers Stadium in his native Pittsburgh.\nCulturally Eckstine was a fashion icon. He was famous for his \"Mr. B. Collar\" \u2013 a high roll collar that formed a \"B\" over a Windsor-knotted tie (or without a tie at all). The collars were worn by many a hipster in the late 1940s and early 1950s.\nIn 1984, Eckstine recorded his penultimate album, I Am a Singer, arranged and conducted by Angelo DiPippo and featuring Toots Thielemans on harmonica. In November 1986, Eckstine recorded with saxophonist Benny Carter for his 1987 album Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter.

His style and technique have been extensively copied by some of the neocommercial singers, but despite their efforts, he remains out front to show how and what should have been done.\nSammy Davis, Jr. made several live appearances and impersonated Eckstine.

He had to fight the system, so things never quite fell into place.\"\nLionel Hampton said: \n\nHe was one of the greatest singers of all time....

Katrin Horn, a postdoctoral fellow in American studies, described her vocal delivery as \"slightly raspy\" with \"a little vibrato\". Musicologist Alexandra Apolloni wrote that Gaga's vocal affectations verge on the melodramatic, underscoring the intentional \"performativity\" in using vocal techniques that convey a sense of strain. According to Apolloni, the introduction\u2014characterized by theatrical \"ohs\"\u2014immediately immerses the listener in heightened emotional landscapes, followed by moments of \"vocal ugliness\", particularly in high chest voice and slurred pitches.

Analyzing the emotional narrative of \"Speechless\", psychoanalyst Robert J. Benton wrote that although the song is dedicated to Gaga's father, the lyrics convey a romantic breakup. Benoten believed after expressing hurt and anger to her ex-lover in the initial lyrics, Gaga has a taunting desire for revenge in the closing line \"Why are you so speechless?\" Exploring Gaga's \"musical intertexts\" on The Fame Monster, authors Lori Burns, Alyssa Woods and Marc Lafrance wrote that in \"Speechless\", she adopts a 1970s rock ballad style reminiscent of artists like Mercury, John Lennon and Elton John. The authors drew thematic connections to Mercury's desire to seek acceptance as an outsider in \"Somebody to Love\", Lennon's pursuit of a utopian society in \"Imagine\" and John's emphasis on \"pure devotion through music and word\" in \"Your Song\".

His three-finger style of playing was radically different from the traditional way the five-string banjo had previously been played. This new style of playing became popular and elevated the banjo from its previous role as a background rhythm instrument to featured solo status. He popularized the instrument across several genres of music.\nScruggs' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in Bill Monroe's band, the Blue Grass Boys. \"Bluegrass\" eventually became the name for an entire genre of country music. Despite considerable success with Monroe, performing on the Grand Ole Opry and recording classic hits such as \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", Scruggs resigned from the group in 1946 because of their exhausting touring schedule. Fellow band member Lester Flatt resigned as well, and he and Scruggs later paired up in the duo Flatt and Scruggs. Scruggs' banjo instrumental \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" was released in 1949 and became an enduring hit. The song experienced a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. The song won two Grammy Awards and, in 2005, was selected for the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit.\nFlatt and Scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\", the theme music for the television sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies\u2014the first Scruggs recording to reach number one on the Billboard charts. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 singles. The duo broke up in 1969, chiefly because, while Scruggs wanted to switch styles to fit a more modern sound, Flatt was a traditionalist who opposed the change and believed doing so would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists. Although each of them formed a new band to match their visions, neither of them ever regained the success they had achieved as a team.\nScruggs received four Grammy awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a National Medal of Arts. He became a member of the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1985, Flatt and Scruggs were inducted together into the Country Music Hall of Fame and named, as a duo, number 24 on CMT's \"40 Greatest Men of Country Music\". Scruggs was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the United States.

His father, George Elam Scruggs, was a farmer and a bookkeeper who died of a protracted illness when Earl was four years old. Upon his father's death, Scruggs' mother, Georgia Lula Ruppe (called Lula), was left to take care of the farm and five children, of which Earl was the youngest.The family members all played music. The father played an open back banjo using the frailing technique, though as an adult Earl had no recollection of his father's playing. Mrs. Scruggs played the pump organ. Earl's siblings, older brothers Junie and Horace and older sisters Eula Mae and Ruby, all played banjo and guitar. Scruggs recalled a visit to his uncle's home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named Mack Woolbright, who played a finger-picking style and had recorded for Columbia Records. It made an impression on Scruggs, who said, \"He'd sit in the rocking chair, and he'd pick some and it was just amazing.

He moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing. After his father's death, Scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music, and when not in school or doing farm chores, spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing. His first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40979", "text": "In 1948 Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs formed the duo Flatt and Scruggs and chose the name \"the Foggy Mountain Boys\" for their backing band. The name came from a song by the Carter Family called \"Foggy Mountain Top\" that the band used as a theme song at the time. Flatt later acknowledged that they consciously tried to make their sound different from Monroe's group. In the mid 1950s they dropped the mandolin and added a Dobro, played by Buck \"Uncle Josh\" Graves. In the spring of 1949, their second Mercury recording session yielded the classic \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\", released on 78 RPM phonograph records that were in use at the time. Previously, Scruggs had performed something similar, called \"Bluegrass Breakdown\" with Bill Monroe, but Monroe had denied him songwriting credit for it. Later, Scruggs changed the song, adding a minor chord, thus creating \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" The song contains a musical oddity\u2014Flatt plays an E major chord against Scruggs's E minor. When asked about the dissonance years later, Scruggs said he had tried to get Flatt to consistently play a minor there to no avail; he said he eventually became used to the sound and even fond of it. The song won a Grammy and became an anthem for many banjo players to attempt to master. The band routinely tuned its instruments a half-step higher than standard tuning in those days to get more brightness or pop to the sound, returning to standard pitch in the 1960s.\nThe popularity of Foggy Mountain Breakdown resurged years later when it was featured in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde, which introduced the song to a younger generation of fans. Scruggs received a phone call from the show's producer and star, Warren Beatty, first asking Scruggs to write a song for the movie. Soon Beatty called back saying that he wanted to use the existing vintage Mercury recording of Foggy Mountain Breakdown, and rejected the argument that it was recorded 18 years prior at a radio station with no modern enhancements. The film was a hit, called by the Los Angeles Times \"a landmark film that helped usher in a new era in American filmmaking.\" In 2005, the song was selected for the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit.In October 1951, the band recorded \"Earl's Breakdown\" which featured a technique where Scruggs would manually de-tune the second and third strings of the banjo during a song using a cam device he had made to attach to the instrument, giving the surprise effect of a downward string bend. He and his brother Horace had experimented with it when they were growing up. Scruggs had drilled some holes in the peghead of his banjo to install the device and chipped the pearl inlay. He covered the holes with a piece of metal, which can be seen on the album cover of Foggy Mountain Jamboree. The technique became popular and led to improvement of the design (without drilling holes) by Bill Keith who then manufactured Scruggs-Keith Tuners. The original tuners Scruggs made and used are now in a museum display at the Earl Scruggs Center in Shelby, North Carolina.In 1953, Martha White Foods sponsored the band's regular early morning radio shows on WSM in Nashville, where the duo sang the company's catchy bluegrass jingle written by Pat Twitty. About this time, country music television shows, on which Flatt and Scruggs appeared regularly, went into syndication, vastly increasing the group's exposure. Despite the group's increasing popularity and fan mail, WSM did not allow Flatt and Scruggs to become members of the Grand Ole Opry at first. According to Tennessean writer Peter Cooper, Bill Monroe was in opposition and worked behind the scenes to keep Flatt and Scruggs off the Opry to the extent of having petitions made against their membership. In 1955 Martha White Foods' CEO Cohen E. Williams intervened by threatening to pull all of his advertising from WSM unless the band appeared on the Opry in the segment sponsored by his company. As years went by, the band became synonymous with Martha White to the extent that the advertising jingle became a hit, and the band rarely played a concert without it. Fans shouted requests for them to play it, even at Carnegie Hall.On September 24, 1962, the duo recorded \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\" for the TV show The Beverly Hillbillies. Sung by Jerry Scoggins, the theme song became an immediate country music hit and was played at the beginning and end of each episode of the series. The song went to #1 on the Billboard country chart, a first for any bluegrass recording. The song spent 20 weeks on that chart; it also reached #44 on Billboard's pop chart. The television show was also a huge hit, broadcast in 76 countries around the world. In Queens, New York a five-year-old boy named B\u00e9la Fleck heard the Jed Clampett theme on television. Fleck said, \"I couldn't breathe or think; I was completely mesmerized.\" He said it awakened a deeply embedded predisposition that \"was just in there\" to learn how to play the banjo. Flatt and Scruggs appeared in several episodes as family friends of the fictional Clampetts. In their first appearance (season 1, episode 20), they portray themselves in the show and perform both the theme song and \"Pearl, Pearl, Pearl\". That song went to #8 on the country chart in 1963. Scruggs published an instruction book entitled \"Earl Scruggs and the Five String Banjo\" in 1968. It received a Gold Book Award by the publisher, Peer-Southern Corporation when it sold over a million copies. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 single records and featured over 20 different musicians as \"Foggy Mountain Boys\"\u2014side men backing the duo.By the end of the 1960s, Scruggs was getting bored with repetition of the classic bluegrass fare. By now, his sons were professional musicians, and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music. He said, \"I love bluegrass music, and still like to play it, but I do like to mix in some other music for my own personal satisfaction, because if I don't, I can get a little bogged down and a little depressed\". Scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts. Columbia Records executives told Flatt and Scruggs that they intended to try a new producer, Bob Johnston, instead of their long-time producer Don Law. Johnston had produced Bob Dylan's records. This new association produced Changin' Times, Nashville Airplane, and The Story of Bonnie and Clyde albums. Flatt was not happy with some of this material\u2014he didn't like singing Bob Dylan songs and refused to perform them, saying \"I can't sing Bob Dylan stuff, I mean. Columbia has got Bob Dylan, why did they want me?\". Even the success of the Bonnie and Clyde album was not enough to prevent their breakup in 1969. After the split, Flatt formed a traditional bluegrass group with Curly Seckler and Marty Stuart called The Nashville Grass, and Scruggs formed the Earl Scruggs Revue with his sons.Neither Flatt nor Scruggs spoke to each other for the next ten years\u2014until 1979 when Flatt was in the hospital. Scruggs made an unannounced visit to his bedside. The two men talked for more than an hour. Even though Flatt's voice was barely above a whisper, he spoke of a reunion. Scruggs answered yes, but told Flatt they would talk when he was better. Flatt said, \"It came as quite a surprise and made me feel good.\" However, Lester Flatt never recovered, and died May 11, 1979. Historian Barry Willis, speaking of the meeting, said \"Earl gave Lester his flowers while he was still living.\" (He was referring to a 1957 Flatt and Scruggs recording of \"Give Me My Flowers While I'm Still Living\".)", "hasanswer": false}]}

The graffiti themed Promoe song These Walls Don't Lie, recorded and mixed by Soundism, took the charts across Europe in 2004. Soundism mixed producer Embee's Tellings from Solitaria, which was rewarded with a Grammis in 2004 as Best HipHop/Soul of the Year.

Noer, produced by G. Dwipayana, and starring Amoroso Katamsi, Umar Kayam, and Syubah Asa. Produced over a period of two years with a budget of Rp. 800 million, the film was sponsored by Suharto's New Order government. It was based on an official history of the 30 September Movement (Gerakan 30 September, or G30S) coup in 1965 written by Nugroho Notosusanto and Ismail Saleh, which depicted the coup as being orchestrated by the Communist Party of Indonesia (Partai Komunis Indonesia, or PKI).\nThe film depicts the period leading up to the coup and several days after it. In a time of economic turmoil, six generals are kidnapped and killed by the PKI and Air Force, purportedly to pre-empt a coup against President Sukarno. General Suharto destroys the coup and, afterwards urges the Indonesian populace to commemorate those killed and fight against all forms of communism. The film shows the G30S leadership as ruthless and planning \"every move to the last detail\", taking joy in using excessive violence and torturing the generals, depictions which have been read as portraying \"the state's enemies as outside the realm of the human\".The first commercially released domestic feature film to deal with the events of 1965, Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI was a commercial and critical success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival, winning one, and reached record viewership numbers \u2013 although in many cases audiences were required to see the film.

Production of the record was handled by NIN frontman \nTrent Reznor and English producer Flood, among other contributors.\nThe album features a heavily synth-driven electronic sound blended with industrial and rock elements. Much like the band's later work, the album's lyrics contain themes of angst, betrayal, and lovesickness. The record was promoted with the singles \"Down in It\", \"Head Like a Hole\", and \"Sin\", as well as the accompanying tour. A remastered edition was released in 2010.\nAlthough the record was successful, reaching No. 75 in the US and receiving highly favorable reviews from critics, Reznor (the band's only official member until 2016) feuded with TVT over promotion of the album, which led him to eventually sign with Interscope Records. Pretty Hate Machine was later certified triple-platinum by RIAA, becoming one of the first independently released albums to do so, and was included on several lists of the best releases of the 1980s. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked Pretty Hate Machine at number 453 on its \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_41496", "text": "\"I wasn't proud of a lot of the things I was saying,\" Reznor recalled, \"but I said to myself, 'Well, no one's going to hear this stuff anyway.' ... The record is honest and that's where its power came from.\"Unlike the industrial music of Nine Inch Nails' contemporaries, Pretty Hate Machine displays catchy riffs and verse-chorus song structures rather than repetitive electronic beats. Reznor's lyrics express adolescent angst and feelings of betrayal by lovers, society, or God. Themes of despair are collocated with lovesick sentiments. Pitchfork's Tom Breihan categorized it as a synth-pop album that was shaped by industrial music's \"nascent new-wave period rather than its subsequent styles.\" According to Breihan, the beats were muscular, but not in the vein of metal or post-punk, and that the most rock-inspired song on the album was \"Head Like a Hole\".Journalist Jon Pareles described the album as \"electro-rock or industrial rock, using drum machines, computerized synthesizer riffs and obviously processed sounds to detail, and usually denounce, an artificial world.\" Tom Popson of the Chicago Tribune called it a dance album partly characterized by industrial dance's aggressive sound: \"Reznor's electronics-plus-guitar LP also carries a brighter techno-pop element that might remind some of Depeche Mode. Things occasionally mellow out to moody atmospherics, while Reznor's vocals range from whispers to screams.\" PopMatters' AJ Ramirez regarded the album as \"a synthesizer-dominated industrial dance record that on occasion slipped under the alternative rock banner.\"Reznor has humorously described Pretty Hate Machine as \"the all-purpose alternative album,\" remarking that \"if you want to stage dive to it, you can, but if you're a big Depeche Mode fan, you can get what you need out of it as well.\" Reznor further stated: \"I like electronic music, but I like it to have some aggression. That 'first wave' of electro music \u2013 Human League and Devo \u2013 that's the easiest way to use it. To be able to get some humanity and aggression into it in a cool way, that's the thing ... Pretty Hate Machine is a record you can listen to and get more out of each time. To me, something like Front 242 is the opposite: great at first but, after 10 listens, that's it.\" Reznor additionally cited Depeche Mode's 1986 album Black Celebration as a driving influence, stating that \"DM was one of our favorite bands and the Black Celebration record took my love for them to a new level.\"In a commentary on the album, Tom Hull said that Reznor's \"notion of industrial is closer to New Order new wave, but with a harder metallic gleam and more dystopian attitude.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41499", "text": "Pretty Hate Machine received widespread acclaim from music critics, who praised the production and Reznor's vocals. In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, Michael Azerrad called Pretty Hate Machine \"industrial-strength noise over a pop framework\" and \"harrowing but catchy music\"; Reznor proclaimed this combination \"a sincere statement\" of \"what was in [his] head at the time\". Robert Hilburn found Reznor's \"dark obsession\" compelling in the Los Angeles Times, while Q's Martin Aston said Reznor \"scans the spectrum of modern dance\" with a \"panoramic vision\" that is \"both admirably adventurous and yet accessible.\" Select critic Neil Perry said that record was \"a flawed but listenable labour of loathing\". Ralph Traitor of Sounds said that \"Reznor has guts, and they make his Machine one to be treated with respect\", finding that the album was comparable to releases by Ministry and Foetus.Jon Pareles was less impressed in his review for The New York Times, writing that Pretty Hate Machine \"stays so close to the conventions established by Depeche Mode, Soft Cell and New Order that it could be a parody album\". Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post found the music \"competent but undistinctive stuff\" and believed the \"angry denunciations\" of songs such as \"Terrible Lie\" are overshadowed by the \"nursery-rhyme\" chants of \"Down in It\". Tom Popson wrote in the Chicago Tribune that \"the playing and production get points for introducing some variety to the industrial style, but the moments of soap-on-a-rope singing tend to cancel them out.\"In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Steve Huey commended Reznor for giving \"industrial music a human voice, a point of connection\" with his \"tortured confusion and self-obsession\", and felt that \"the greatest achievement of Pretty Hate Machine was that it brought emotional extravagance to a genre whose main theme had nearly always been dehumanization.\" Upon its 2010 reissue, Will Hermes of Rolling Stone called it \"the first industrial singer-songwriter album\" and commended the sound produced by Flood and Keith LeBlanc, who he said \"taught Reznor a lot.\" Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club felt that the album \"remains the work of an artist just discovering his voice\" and said that \"20 years later, it doesn't warrant repeat listens like its successors.\" He found some of its synth and sampled sounds to still be dated after the album's remastering and Reznor's lyrics \"mopey\" and \"silly\". In an interview with Blender, journalist and novelist Chuck Palahniuk said that the album \"seemed like the first honest piece of music I ever heard.\" In 2020, Pretty Hate Machine was included at number 453 on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Carey worked with various songwriters and producers on the project, including Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, Stargate, The-Dream, Tricky Stewart, Scott Storch and Danja.\nThe album revealed a more personal side of the singer, illustrated in its declarative theme of emancipation from her previous marriage, and from her personal and professional setbacks. It was meant to be a continuation, or a second part of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Although it shared similar vocal production as well as an inclination to her signature pop and R&B ballads, the album also encompassed a variety of dance-oriented and uptempo styles. Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy. Though considered by critics very similar to the formula its predecessor had been built on, E=MC\u00b2 included other genres she had never explored, such as reggae, and her continued recording of gospel-influenced hymns.\nE=MC\u00b2 was generally well received by music critics, with many complimenting the record's broad genre influences, and musical and production styles.

The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with opening week sales of 463,000 copies; the highest first-week sales of Carey's career. It also debuted at number one in Canada, and opened inside the top-five in Australia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album has sold over 2.5 million copies.\nFour singles were released to promote the album. The album's lead single, \"Touch My Body\", became Carey's eighteenth chart-topper on the Billboard Hot 100, tying her with Elvis Presley as the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, a record she has since surpassed. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the chart, tying Presley for most weeks at number one. It achieved strong worldwide charting, peaking within the top five of the singles charts in Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \"Bye Bye\" served as the album's second release. Although hailed by critics, and expected to have achieved large commercial success, the song stalled at number nineteen on the Hot 100, and managed to chart weakly internationally.

From the age of fourteen, he was educated at the Conservatory of San Onofrio by Leonardo Leo and Francesco Durante, thanks to the intervention of the Bishop of Bari (his father, although himself a musician, was opposed to his son following the same career).\nPiccinni's first opera, Le donne dispettose, was produced in 1755 with the patronage of Prince Vintimille. In 1760 he composed, at Rome, the chef d'\u0153uvre of his early life, La Cecchina, ossia la buona Figliuola, an opera buffa with a libretto by Carlo Goldoni, which \"enjoyed a two-year run in Rome and was played in all the important European capitals. It can probably be called the most popular opera buffa of the 18th century...[even more than]... Pergolesi's La serva padrona...[and]... The first of the new era, culminating in the masterworks of Mozart.\"La buona figliuola represents a special moment in the history of eighteenth-century music in which comedy began to take on a new dramatic force. It is the moment at which the self-consciously sentimental theatrical project of Carlo Goldoni (the opera's librettist) is married with the developing musical language of classicism. This can especially be seen in the sensitive writing of Cecchina's act 2 aria \"Una povera ragazza\".The opera was such a success that fashions of dress, shops, and houses were all named after La Cecchina. It also set off a debate about the merits of the new sentimental style, especially in England, where conservative reactionaries were wary of the supposed feminizing influence of modern Italian music. Antonio Baretti commented in 1768 that individuals \u201cof weight and consideration\u201d should not be blamed for condemning \u201cthose puny gentlemen\u201d who, as enthusiasts of Italian opera, were able to \u201cfeel its minuet niceties, and to be of course in rapture with the languishing Cecchina\u2019s of Piccini  [sic].\u201d This modern music, Baretti decried, \u201cfar from having any power of increasing courage or any manly virtues, has on the contrary a tendency towards effeminacy and cowardliness.\u201dSix years after this, Piccinni was invited by Queen Marie Antoinette to Paris. He became the first Italian after Jean-Baptiste Lully to write operas for the Academie royale de musique (the Paris Opera). He collaborated with the poet and dramatist Marmontel on several projects designed to advance the cause of the operatic reform. Marmontel's first librettos took as their foundation texts Philippe Quinault had written for Lully, Roland 1778, and Atys, 1779. Subsequent works, starting with Didon, used original texts. All his later works were successful, but the directors of the Grand Opera conceived the idea of deliberately opposing him to Gluck by persuading the two composers to treat the same subject \u2013 Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride \u2013 simultaneously. The Parisian public was divided into two rival parties, which, under the names of Gluckists and Piccinnists, carried on an unworthy and disgraceful war. Gluck's masterly Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride was first produced on 18 May 1779. Piccinni's Iphig\u00e9nie followed on 23 January 1781. The antagonism of the rival parties continued, even after Gluck left Paris in 1780; and an attempt was afterwards made to inaugurate a new rivalry with Sacchini. Piccinni remained popular, and on the death of Gluck, in 1787, proposed that a public monument be erected to his memory \u2013 a suggestion which the Gluckists refused to support.\nIn 1784 Piccinni became professor at the Royal School of Music, one of the institutions from which the Conservatoire was formed in 1794. On the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Piccinni returned to Naples, where he was at first well received by King Ferdinand IV; but the marriage of his daughter Claire to a French democrat named Pierre Prades-Prestreau brought him disgrace \u2013 he was accused of being a revolutionary and placed under house arrest for four years. For the next nine years he maintained a precarious existence in Venice, Naples and Rome; but he returned in 1798 to Paris, where the public received him with enthusiasm, but he made no money. He died in Passy, near Paris. During his life, he worked with the greatest librettists of his age, including Metastasio. After his death a memorial tablet was set up in the house in which he was born at Bari.\nHe had married in 1756 his pupil Vincenza Sibilla, a singer, whom he never allowed to appear on the stage after their marriage.

The band's third member, Asaki Yamahana, was initially only involved as a live support member but eventually became a full-fledged band member after gaining popularity with the fans. Having amassed a significant following by 1996, Guniw Tools was signed to Victor Entertainment, a major record company, and quickly released their first album Niwlun on Victor's Invitation label.\nA home video was released to accompany Niwlun, featuring music videos for each song on the album primarily directed by Furukawa and shot and produced by the band themselves. These \"DIY\" videos would become a signature of the band, and almost all releases by the band (albums and singles alike) had a corresponding VHS release with videos for each song.\n1997 saw the release of their second album Other Goose, followed by the mini-album Sparky. Though these albums proved to be successful (and would in fact be the highest-charting albums of the band's career), JAKE was not satisfied with the direction the band and chose to leave the project, leaving the band without their main composer.\nWith JAKE gone, the band continued as a duo and Asaki took over the duties as the band's main composer which led to a noticeable shift in style.

These allegations have never been addressed by the band.\nIn 2000 the band released the single CULLUCOO VISION before announcing a hiatus while the two band members explored new musical venues.

Goya became a court painter to the Spanish Crown in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and Rococo-style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace.\nAlthough Goya's letters and writings survive, little is known about his thoughts. He had a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 that left him deaf, after which his work became progressively darker and pessimistic. His later easel and mural paintings, prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social and political levels, and contrast with his social climbing. He was appointed Director of the Royal Academy in 1795, the year Manuel Godoy made an unfavorable treaty with France. In 1799, Goya became Primer Pintor de C\u00e1mara (Prime Court Painter), the highest rank for a Spanish court painter. In the late 1790s, commissioned by Godoy, he completed his La maja desnuda, a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. In 1800\u201301, he painted Charles IV of Spain and His Family, also influenced by Vel\u00e1zquez.\nIn 1807, Napoleon led the French army into the Peninsular War against Spain. Goya remained in Madrid during the war, which seems to have affected him deeply. Although he did not speak his thoughts in public, they can be inferred from his Disasters of War series of prints (although published 35 years after his death) and his 1814 paintings The Second of May 1808 and The Third of May 1808. Other works from his mid-period include the Caprichos and Los Disparates etching series, and a wide variety of paintings concerned with insanity, mental asylums, witches, fantastical creatures and religious and political corruption, all of which suggest that he feared for both his country's fate and his own mental and physical health.\nHis late period culminates with the Black Paintings of 1819\u20131823, applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the Quinta del Sordo (House of the Deaf Man) where, disillusioned by political and social developments in Spain, he lived in near isolation. Goya eventually abandoned Spain in 1824 to retire to the French city of Bordeaux, accompanied by his much younger maid and companion, Leocadia Weiss, who may have been his lover. There he completed his La Tauromaquia series and a number of other works. Following a stroke that left him paralyzed on his right side, Goya died and was buried on 16 April 1828 aged 82.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_53440", "text": "San Francisco Suite is an album by American pianist Freddie Redd recorded in 1957 and released on the Riverside label.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They popularised such old songs as \"D\u00falam\u00e1n\", \"Teidhir Abhaile Ri\u00fa\" and \"Coinleach Glas An Fh\u00f3mhair\", and these songs remained favourites at their concerts. After departing from their folk and traditional background in 1982, they created a new sound that was to define the meaning of New Age and Celtic music. When \"Theme from Harry's Game\" and \"Newgrange\" were first heard, radio stations all over the world were fascinated by an unearthly and spiritual sound that they had not heard before. One critic said \"the tunes were steeped in the old ways, but the production and the arrangement was fresh and inventive\". This transition in Clannad's career is often seen as the birth of Celtic music, and they are regarded as pioneers of the genre. They are also noted for their melodious harmonies, which have been at the heart of their music since their first album. Legend (1984) was based on English folklore, and with later albums Clannad delved further into the realms of electronica and pop. Many of their singles entered pop charts around the world and widened their fan base. Despite their success with this genre of music, the group maintained a link with their Gaelic roots, giving traditional Irish songs such as \"Tr\u00e1thn\u00f3na Beag Ar\u00e9ir\" and \"Buachaill \u00d3n \u00c9irne\" the Clannad treatment.\nWhile the rock-infused Sirius and the pop-inclined Macalla were successful, the style that the band created themselves has left the greatest legacy. Its influence can be found in the soundtrack of the film Titanic, where composer James Horner imitated Clannad's musical style and the soundtrack sounded so much like Clannad that it has been mistakenly attributed to them. The band's 'Celtic mysticism' is a recurring theme in the film Intermission. Lead singer Moya Brennan said that Clannad's \"otherworldly\" and \"ethereal\" sound came from the ancient hills and glens that surrounded Gweedore. Traces of Clannad's legacy can be heard in the music of many artists, including Enya, Altan, Capercaillie, The Corrs, Loreena McKennitt, An\u00fana, Riverdance, \u00d3rla Fallon and U2. Bono said Moya had \"one of the greatest voices the human ear has ever experienced\".A Japanese visual novel released in 2004, which spawned a 2007 film and a 2007\u201308 television series based on it, was named after the band because screenwriter Jun Maeda mistakenly believed it to mean the word \"family\" in Irish.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41716", "text": "Clannad (Irish pronunciation: [\u02c8kl\u02e0an\u032a\u02e0\u0259d\u032a\u02e0]) are an Irish band formed in 1970 in Gweedore, County Donegal, by siblings Ciar\u00e1n, P\u00f3l and Moya Ui Bhraon\u00e1in (in English, Brennan) and their twin uncles Noel and P\u00e1draig \u00d3 D\u00fag\u00e1in (Duggan). They have adopted various musical styles throughout their history. Beginning as an acoustic folk group mainly performing rearranged traditional Irish songs in Irish, they expanded their sound with original songs in English, vocal harmonies, electronic keyboards, and elements of rock, Celtic, new age, smooth jazz, and Gregorian chant.Initially known as Clann as Dobhar ('Family from Dore'), they shortened their name to Clannad in 1973. By 1979 they had released three albums and toured Europe and the US. From 1980 to 1982 they operated as a six-piece with their sister and niece Eithne (Enya). In 1982 they gained international attention with their single \"Theme from Harry's Game\". They experimented with New Age and pop-influenced sounds in the 1980s and 1990s and their music came to be defined as almost purely Celtic, making them innovators of that genre. In 1997, after 15 albums, they took a break and pursued solo projects. The band regrouped in 2007 as a four piece with Moya, Ciar\u00e1n, Noel and P\u00e1draig and completed a world tour in 2008. In 2013, P\u00f3l rejoined and they released their first studio album in fifteen years.

Berling gives such a moving sermon, though, that the parishioners and bishop are ready to forgive him until he begins to denounce their hypocrisy. Driven into exile, he becomes tutor to Ebba Dohna, stepdaughter of the mistress of Borg, an estate near Ekeby. The mother hopes to have Ebba marry Berling so that she will be disinherited for marrying a commoner, allowing the mother's natural son, Hendrik, to become heir to the estate.\nAt that time, Hendrik returns from a trip to Italy with his new wife, Elizabeth.  At dinner that night, Berling's past is exposed, devastating Ebba, who is in love with him, but rousing the sympathy of Elizabeth. Berling leaves Borg and is found half-frozen by Margaretha who brings him to Ekeby and makes him one of the Cavaliers. Berling eventually learns of Ebba's death, apparently from grief, and Margaretha tells him of how she had left home under the curse of her mother because of her own love for a man.\nLater, at a dinner party, Berling is one of several performers in pantomimes and skits.  In a scene with a young neighbor woman, Marianne Sinclaire, she kisses him, although the audience thinks it is part of the act.  Marianne's father, however, is outraged and leaves the party, with Marianne walking in the snow to their house, where her father refuses to let her in.  Back at the party, Margarethe's own past is exposed by one of the Cavaliers, and her husband the Major throws her out of the house. Disgusted with life, the Major gives control of Ekeby to the Cavaliers, bitterly predicting that they will ruin the estate.\nBerling searches for Margaretha but finds Marianne collapsed in the snow by her family's front door. Berling takes her back to Ekeby but tries to keep her presence confidential since she has fallen ill. In the meantime, Margarethe has returned to the cottage where her mother still lives, seeking forgiveness. As the old woman collapses and lies dying, there is a partial reconciliation but Margarethe realizes that she must atone for her past by driving the Cavaliers out of Ekeby.\nAt Borg, Hendrik learns that his Italian marriage to Elizabeth will not be considered legal until they both sign certain documents.  At Ekeby, Berling considers marriage to Marianne, but she turns him away when she reveals that her face has been scarred by smallpox.  Margarethe, driven by her own guilt and rage, assembles a party to set fire to the wing of Ekeby housing the Cavaliers in order to capture and exile them, but the fire gets out of control and begins to burn the central mansion housing Marianne, whom Berling manages to save from the flames just as her father arrives, now relieved that his daughter is safe.\nAt Borg, seeing the fire, Elizabeth heads across the lake to Ekeby on foot, where she is discovered by Berling who was driving a sleigh across the ice.  At first, in a fit of passion, Berling proposes eloping and taking Elizabeth away from V\u00e4rmland and beyond.  But he turns the sleigh back when he realizes that they are being pursued on the frozen lake by a pack of wolves, which they eventually outrun.\nBack at Borg, Hendrik offers Elizabeth the new wedding documents to sign and legalize their marriage, but she has to confess that she has not given her heart to him, leading to the ultimate dashing of Hendrik's mother's hopes.  Elizabeth goes to live with the Sinclaires, where she and Marianne become good friends. On a visit to Margarethe in her mother's cottage, Elizabeth confesses her love for Berling, who had just entered the room without her noticing.

It was released as a launch title for the Xbox 360 video game console in 2005. The game is part of the Perfect Dark series and a prequel to the original Perfect Dark. The story of the game follows Joanna Dark, a bounty hunter working with her father and a computer hacker, as she joins the Carrington Institute agency to prevent a rival corporation from gaining possession of an ancient artefact which endows individuals with superhuman powers.\nPerfect Dark Zero features a campaign mode consisting of 14 missions that can be played solo or co-operatively, and a multiplayer mode where a maximum of 32 players can compete against each other in numerous types of deathmatch and objective-based games. Both the co-operative and multiplayer modes support split screen, system link, and the Xbox Live online service. The game was under development for five years and was originally intended to be released for the GameCube and later the Xbox. During development, several intended features were canceled so that the game could meet the Xbox 360 launch.\nUpon release, Perfect Dark Zero sold more than one million copies worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its graphics and numerous multiplayer modes. However, some critics felt that the game did not meet expectations, criticising single-player aspects such as its story and voice acting.

Prior to its release, Microsoft arranged a deal with Tor Books to produce novels set in the Perfect Dark universe. A six-issue comic book series written by Eric Trautmann and illustrated by Cold FuZion Studios was also announced. Around the same time, Joanna Dark made an appearance on the cover of FHM magazine.

The combat features mechanics such as an evasive dodge roll and a cover system in which the gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to aim strategically without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles as long as they can reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. When doing so the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took.Players can only carry a limited number of weapons since the inventory features a 4-slot system in which single hand-held pistols usually take a weapon slot, whereas heavy weapons like sniper rifles or rocket launchers can take up to three weapon slots. The player's movement speed is also altered by the weight of the weapon the player is currently holding. Besides the primary function, all of the weapons in Perfect Dark Zero have one or two additional function modes that generally grant the player with special abilities. For example, the Shockwave Rifle features an X-ray function which allows the player to see enemies through walls, while the Plasma Rifle has a cloak function that renders the player character invisible to enemies at the cost of its battery charge. Some weapons also feature more unorthodox secondary functions.

Vampyr was funded by Nicolas de Gunzburg who starred in the film under the name of Julian West among a mostly non-professional cast. Gunzburg plays the role of Allan Gray, a student of the occult who enters the village of Courtempierre, which is under the curse of a vampire.\nVampyr was challenging for Dreyer to make as it was his first sound film and was required to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with  title cards like a silent film. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The soundtrack was created in Berlin where the characters\u2019 voices, sound effects, and score were recorded.\nVampyr had a delayed release in Germany and opened to a generally negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut. The film was long considered a low point in Dreyer's career, but modern critical reception to the film has become much more favorable with critics praising the film's disorienting visual effects and atmosphere.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Smyth first studied with Alexander Ewing when she was 17. He introduced her to the music of Wagner and Berlioz. After a major battle with her father about her plans to devote her life to music, Smyth was allowed to advance her musical education at the Leipzig Conservatory, where she studied Brahmsian musical composition with Carl Reinecke. She left after a year, however, disillusioned with the low standard of teaching, and continued her music studies privately with Heinrich von Herzogenberg. While at the Leipzig Conservatory, Smyth met Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Grieg and Tchaikovsky. Through Herzogenberg, she also met Clara Schumann and Brahms. Upon her return to England, Smyth formed a supportive friendship with Arthur Sullivan in the last years of his life; he respected her and encouraged her work.\n\nSmyth's extensive body of work includes the Concerto for Violin, Horn and Orchestra and the Mass in D. It was the latter's performance in London's Albert Hall in 1893 that helped her gain recognition as a serious composer. Her opera The Wreckers is considered by some critics to be the \"most important English opera composed during the period between Purcell and Britten.\" Her best known work, she composed it to a French libretto by Henry Brewster. It premiered in 1906. In 2022 it received its first professional production in its original French text at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera. It was also performed at the BBC Proms, where its prelude or overture was presented 27 times between 1913 and 1947.Another of her operas, Der Wald, mounted in 1903, was, for more than a century, the only opera by a woman composer ever produced at New York's Metropolitan Opera (until Kaija Saariaho's L'Amour de loin in December 2016).On 28 May 1928, the nascent BBC broadcast two concerts of Smyth's music, marking her \"musical jubilee\", The first comprised chamber music, the second, conducted by Smyth herself, choral works.

Heartbreakingly, at this moment of long-overdue recognition, the composer was already completely deaf and could hear neither her own music nor the adulation of the crowds.\nAfter her release from prison, Smyth composed her final major work, the hour-long vocal symphony The Prison, setting a text by Henry Bennett Brewster. It was first performed in 1931. The first recording was issued by Chandos in 2020. Smyth\u2019s composing and conducting career came to a premature end before the 1920s as she started to develop hearing loss, which eventually led to her becoming completely deaf.[1] However, she found a new interest in literature and, between 1919 and 1940, she published ten highly successful, mostly autobiographical, books.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_42063", "text": "Ethel Smyth featured, under the name of Edith Staines, in E.

The final choice is that of the character's profession, similar to the character classes of other role-playing games.\nThe game's multiplayer nature and \"free-form\" gameplay encourage creating personal networks, and cooperating and fighting with other players. Players interact with Anarchy Online's interface via a keyboard and mouse. The game's heads-up display consists of a series of windows, menus and buttons located on the periphery of the screen. Players communicate with each other by typing text in chat windows, and occasionally through emotive character animations. Communication with computer-controlled characters is executed via text windows, in which players chose from a menu of possible responses to the conversation being shown. Like most role playing games, Anarchy Online provides structure for role-playing events. Most major cities include night clubs and other venues specifically for this. Events are organized either by players, or officially by Funcom staff.Groups of players, large or small, are often required to complete objectives. In addition to forming teams and informal chat groups, joining a player organization is encouraged.

Dynamic missions are similar to traditional missions in purpose, but are created at the player's request. Once they choose its difficulty and other options, the game generates a new indoor area filled with computer-controlled enemies. The player or team are told to go to its location, and finish some task inside for their reward.

The PC Engine version of the game was reviewed in the February 1990 issue of German magazine Power Play, where reviewer Martin Gaksch called the game \"Zelda on the PC-Engine\" and said that the \"differences between Zelda and Neutopia must be found with an electron microscope\". They said that the graphics, music, and gameplay were good, and that the only thing that kept Neutopia from being superior to Zelda was the 24-character password system and that the text was in Japanese.Neutopia received much coverage from various video gaming websites after its release on the Virtual Console, and each drew comparisons to Zelda. Adam Romano from Defunct Games noted that Neutopia was released two years before The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and said that Neutopia \"kept pace with or were actually ahead of the Nintendo curve\". He said that gameplay and backgrounds remain varied and that \"the fire rod weapon is especially fun to wield\", but noted that the things that keep the game from being better than Zelda were repetitive and frustrating dungeon exploring, boring boss battles, long passwords (for those who do not own a TurboGrafx-CD), and several \"head-scratching moments\" which include references to Judaism and Islam as well as quotes from Star Wars. Marcel van Duyn from Nintendo Life noted many similarities to Zelda, including the existence of 8 dungeons and medallions, the need to blow up walls or burn bushes to uncover secrets, the dungeon designs, and the need to push blocks to uncover staircases. However, he noted that what sets it apart from Zelda are the fire rod, the ability to warp with wings, and a lower difficulty level. He concluded that the game, while copying Zelda, might be better as it added additional features that set it apart. Destructoid's Tony Ponce compared the game's copying of Zelda to China Warrior's copying of Kung-Fu Master, and he pointed out what are also considered Zelda clones such as Crusader of Centy and Alundra for the Sega Genesis and PlayStation, respectively.GameSpot's Austin Shau reviewed Neutopia in November 2007 and said progression through the game was \"quick and direct\" but was also more linear, unlike with Zelda. He praised the game for its variety of environments, which he said \"helps to combat monotony\", but he noted the lack of detail in the graphics itself. He also criticized the game's sound, in which he said the background music was a series of \"grating instrumentations\" while also pointing out the low-quality TurboGrafx-16 sound chip. IGN's Lucas Thomas called Neutopia \"one of the most shameless Legend of Zelda clones ever created\" in nearly every aspect. He praised one of the differences in the presence of the fire rod, which he said \"is unlike any weapon the 8-bit Link ever wielded\"; he also noted the clean, crisp graphics and a good quality soundtrack. He criticized another difference from Zelda, that Neutopia had poor collision detection, saying that it can lead to additional damage to Jazeta, which causes the power of the fire rod to decrease and lead to the annoying \"beeping sound\" just as in Zelda. In general, Thomas said that, despite its lack of originality, Neutopia is a good TurboGrafx-16 game which has deserved all the praise it has received.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Their influences included bluegrass, folk, punk, and other musical styles. The original lineup, formed in 1990, included Danny Barnes on banjo, guitar and resonator guitar, Mark Rubin on upright bass and tuba, and Ralph White III on fiddle and accordion. Barnes composed the majority of the group's original songs. When White left the group at the end of 1996, he was briefly replaced by Bob Grant on mandolin and guitar. Barnes and Rubin then continued to perform and record as a duo until unofficially dissolving the band in 2000. The band has neither toured nor recorded since then, but Barnes and Rubin have played a few live shows with Grant in 2008, 2009, and 2014.The Bad Livers' music has often been cited for its influence on other groups, creating what The Austin Chronicle described as \"an impressive legacy\". The Stranger credited them with \"revitalizing roots music\", and, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, \"The Bad Livers helped open the way for old-time and bluegrass bands of today\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_42354", "text": "The Bad Livers formed in 1990, when Barnes \"came up with this idea that it would be great to have a small-format acoustic band that could play different kinds of music [at a] virtuoso level, where they could play any kind of music\". He began playing with Rubin and White, and the trio adopted the name Bad Livers in the summer of 1990. They began playing frequently in Austin, including a weekly set at the Saxon Pub. A typical set in 1991 included a wide variety of styles and periods of music, as Rubin later explained: \"We were doing Mississippi John Hurt, gospel tunes, Captain Beefheart\u2014anything, really, but it was Mot\u00f6rhead or the Misfits that caught on.\"Imprecise descriptions of the Bad Livers' music abounded: \"thrash-grass\", \"acoustic bluegrass with a punk death wish\", \"something called 'contemporary bluegrass,'\" and \"acoustic-metal-bluegrass\", although these same sources would cite the band as \"much-lauded\" and note that \"the musicians can really play\". The recurrence of the term bluegrass, however bizarrely it was modified, along with counter-assessments of them as \"good, faithful traditionalists\" who \"preserve the spirit as well as the technique of old-timey folk music\", created a generic perplexity that led Austin country legend Don Walser to observe that the only question he couldn't answer was what kind of music the Bad Livers played.Barnes insisted that the Bad Livers were not a bluegrass band, but had created an original sound: \"This isn't bluegrass and it isn't this or that. It's Bad Liver music. We end up making our own thing.\" Barnes' original compositions were featured on their first album, Delusions of Banjer, released in 1992 on Quarterstick Records and produced by Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers. The album was praised for \"Barnes's strong material, as well as the group's tight musical interaction\". Barnes credited the latter with improving the former: \"The musical telepathy is really good. I can sort of tailor-make a song to the guys' playing, make the song fit what they're doing, since I write most of the material.\"Rubin claimed that they had decided to incorporate the accordion and tuba into the band to counteract their growing popularity, but to no avail: their audience continued to widen and more critics saw beyond the gimmicky descriptions to the band's innovation and skill. The Washington Post described them as \"truly great\", The Times-Picayune praised their \"serious musicianship\" and Barnes' \"soulful, urgent lead vocals\", while Rolling Stone admired their \"striking blend of virtuoso flash and poignant simplicity\". Don McLeese of the Austin American-Statesman twice described the Bad Livers as \"Austin's best band\" and raved of one live show: \"The uncommon telepathy enjoyed by Danny Barnes, Mark Rubin and Ralph White makes the band's frenetic acoustic interplay sound like the work of a six-armed, multistringed monster.\" Barnes was voted \"Best Player of Any Other Instrument\" for the banjo at the Austin Music Awards in 1991 and 1992, and the Bad Livers were voted \"Best None of the Above\" for four consecutive years from 1991 to 1994.The Bad Livers' second album, Horses in the Mines, was produced by Barnes and released on Quarterstick in 1994. In his review, McLeese admired them as \"a band drawing from the wellspring of tradition to create something fresh, vital and original\". S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung found that the record \"sounded quite authentic\u2014almost as if it had long held a place in the Library of Congress\". Raoul Hern\u00e1ndez poetically concurred, saying that the record sounded \"like a bunch of skeletons cackling into the sole microphone that dangles from the outhouse ceiling\".The Bad Livers spent 1995 and 1996 touring and working on side projects as well as looking for a new label to release their next album. Finally the band signed a three-album deal with Sugar Hill Records, which had more experience than Quarterstick at \"selling banjo records\". Their first album for the label, Hogs on the Highway, was released along with the information that White had decided to leave the band. It was announced that he was to be replaced by Bob Grant, though Grant's tenure with the band did not last long. Both White and Grant appeared on Hogs on the Highway, which received enthusiastic reviews from Sing Out!, praising Barnes' \"quirky and inventive\" original songs, and the Old-Time Herald, admiring the \"considerable skill\" with which Barnes crafted his lyrics. The Austin American-Statesman agreed that Barnes was \"an entirely underrated songwriter\" as well as a \"banjo wizard\", while The Washington Post lauded his \"timeless, deadpan voice\". The Sydney Morning Herald was appreciative of the \"beautifully controlled ambience\" of the entire album.\nShortly after the album's release, Barnes moved from Austin to Port Hadlock, Washington, though he and Rubin continued to work closely together on the score for the Richard Linklater film The Newton Boys as well as the Bad Livers' next album. Although the soundtrack was admired by The Village Voice and Entertainment Weekly as well as the Austin papers, the film did not fare well at the box office, and the soundtrack album did not sell well. The Bad Livers' second album for Sugar Hill, Industry and Thrift, was released in September 1998 with only Barnes and Rubin credited as members of the band, though the album features various guest musicians, including members of Rubin's side project, Rubinchik\u2019s Orkestyr, who are featured on the track \"A Yid Ist Geboren inz Oklahoma\". The album garnered positive reviews, and the Chicago Tribune selected it as the best bluegrass album of 1998, while The Times of London admired its \"genuine originality\". Industry and Thrift did not receive as much attention from the press as Hogs on the Highway had, however, and as Barnes lamented, the album \"fell off the face of the earth\".The Bad Livers' final album, Blood and Mood, was released in February 2000 and featured, as The Austin Chronicle noted with astonishment: \"Electric punk rock, sample-based tunes with drum tracks, and a shocking scarcity of juiced-up banjo playing\". The Independent named it \"the leftfield album of the week\" and found that it \"brims with enthusiastic ideas\", while The Washington Post was puzzled but invigorated by a live show supporting the album, concluding that it had been \"Fascinating. Even refreshing\". Although it left No Depression depressed, Daniel Wolff found the album to be uniquely evocative of a \"rural eccentricity\" that had not yet been extinguished and formed a kind of continuum with punk and old-time country: \"Either the Bad Livers pick up where 'I Wish I Were a Mole in the Ground' left off, or Bascom Lunsford discovered the punk aesthetic in the 1920s.\" Blood and Mood did not sell well, and by the summer of 2000 the Bad Livers appeared to be \"over for good\".The Bad Livers were inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame in 2007.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_24855", "text": "Undead Unplugged is the first acoustic album by horror punk musician Wednesday 13.
