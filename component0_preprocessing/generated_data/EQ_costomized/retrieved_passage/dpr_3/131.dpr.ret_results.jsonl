The Golgast-e Mosalla were gardens (now known as Musalla Gardens) that featured in Hafiz's poetry.  With a surface of over 19,000 square metres, the gardens were also home to one of Shiraz's cemeteries, and Babur had a pool built here at the same time as the memorial.

This is one of the several legends of the establishment of the county of Altena and the building of the castle.\nAfter the acquisition of the parish land of Mark near the city of Hamm in 1198, the counts of Altena took Mark Castle as their primary residence and called themselves the Counts of the Mark. They continued to only occasionally inhabit Altena Castle and from 1392 onward it was only used as a residence for the county bailiff (Amtmann). Count Engelbert III of the Mark gave the small settlement at the base of the mountain the rights of liberty (such as self-governance). In 1455 the castle burned down and was only re-erected partially.\nIn Brandenburg-Prussian times the castle became a garrison and was sold to the town of Altena in 1771. In the following years an almshouse and a workhouse was established there. This existed until 1840. From 1766 to 1811 there existed a criminal court and prison in the castle. By 1834 the castle was greatly deteriorated and was to be reconstructed. Due to lack of funds, however, this was not carried out. The Johanniter Orde set up a hospital in the buildings.Due to the 300th anniversary of the membership of the County of Mark to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1909 plans for a reconstruction of the castle began. In 1914 this was completed, apart from the outer bailey and lower gatehouse. There was a controversial debate about the modes of reconstruction, where the preference of historic designs over the medieval and early modern architecture was criticised.

If one traces the patterns with different colored markers, one would find that between the boxes are two contiguous geometric patterns that resemble a maze. One \"maze\" is contained by the other on the left hand side.\nThe swastika that appears in the lower left hand corner is not part of the original work. A 1930s-era photo featured in the Hemet Centennial calendar shows the stone without this. (Featured photo of July 2010; available from the Hemet Museum).The stone and its surrounding land were designated as a California state landmark in 1956. Sometime later a vandal added a counter-clockwise swastika to one corner of the carving. This is not the same swastika that the Nazis in Germany appropriated after WWI; the Nazis used the clockwise version of the swastika.\nSwastikas were used in Oriental and Native American art long before the Nazis used it as a symbol. The stone is now protected by a pair of chain-link fences.\nThe maze petroglyph, depending upon interpretation, could show four walled structures or areas, consisting of two simple objects and two \u201cmaze-like\u201d complex objects. There is an inner and outer object for each type of simple or complex object.\nTo reference the diagram called \u201cConceptual Approximation of the Maze Stone near Hemet, California,\u201d the \"simple\" objects are denoted by the square/rectangular black (outer) and gray/beige (inner) lines. The gray/beige area is filled in and appears as a rectangular object.  What the computer considers a gray color, other people say is the color beige. The \"complex\" objects are blue (outer) and purple (inner). The purplish complex object appears to be completely surrounded by the blueish complex object. The inner objects are completely surrounded in the space created by the outer objects. The blueish object seems to surround the simple gray object in the center, but is unable to completely do so. The gray/beige object is either directly attached and is completely surrounded by the space associated with the outer black boundary wall that surrounds the whole \u201cmaze.\u201d\nTaking away or adding the blue and purple areas makes no difference to the relationship between the inner gray/beige object and the outer black boundary line, as the space between them is still connected. The space inside the black line was left white/blank. The diagram was created from multiple pictures, and visual guesswork was used with a computer graphics program to draw straight, colorized lines without measurements.\nThe petroglyph appears to be a square, although the attempt to redo the diagram by computer produced better results when slightly elongated as a rectangle. Also the original is on the slightly curved surface of a stone. Whether the maze can be recreated in a square while attempting to keep all the lines \"uniformly separated\" on a flat surface arose as an issue for the creator of the conceptual approximation diagram. Since there are ten lines to be crossed on the top, bottom, left and right of the original petroglyph, the idealized version of the \u201cmaze\u201d could fit into a square.\nThe original design constraints and reasoning behind the prehistoric design remain unclear. At any given spot in the blueish space, there are up to three possible directions to follow, not the four directions possible when 90-degree line segments join. The outside edge of the outer complex object shows the outline of the inner complex object three times. There are three \u201cdead ends\u201d (in maze terminology) to the blueish-object's area. If one looks at the spot where two of the blueish ends meet before reaching the inner complex object on the left side, one would have to transverse six straight segments to reach that point \u2013 from either end point.\nThe analysis discussion can be changed by switching the \"walls\" to pathways and the pathways to be impassable areas, but the \u201cmaze\u201d has design features that have nothing to do with a conventional \u201cmaze\u201d. That is, where the objective is to go from a starting point to an ending point through a confusing set of passageways. The Maze Stone is not what European Americans might consider to be a regular maze. Without knowing the original intent of the creator, it is difficult to know if the maze represents an engineering drawing, a symbol, an artistic concept, or something else.\nThis petroglyph is classified as California Engraved, within the California Tradition of rock art.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "740_18815", "text": "Apache Stone is an American rock band from New York City.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Rand. His report was released on January 29, 1946. The Rand Formula, as it became known, was one result of his report.

Ford did not extend these same provisions to their Canadian workers, this resulted in \"bad faith\" between the company and the Canadian UAW. Following the ratification of a company-recognized UAW Canadian union on January 15, 1942, periodic work stoppages took place. In response to company continuance of making decisions as it had prior to the formalizing of the union, walkouts took place in November 1942, April 1943 and April-May 1944, these were all precursors of the Ford Strike of 1945.Throughout 1945 negotiations for a new company-union agreement were conducted. On January 22, 1945, the Ontario minister of Labour Charles Daley, upon request from the Ontario Labour relations Board, appointed Louis Fine as conciliation officer in an attempt to reach an agreement in the contentious negotiations. On March 28 Fine reported back stating: \"...in his opinion an agreement was impossible and the situation was very complicated and difficult.\" On August 31 Ford notified the union that 800 workers were to be laid off, on September 4 tensions were further exacerbated when an additional 1656 layoffs were projected to occur by September 14. Essentially these layoff announcements ended any hopes for a non-strike agreement to be reached. On the morning of September 12, 1945, at 10 a.m., after 18 months of failed negotiations, UAW workers took part in a wildcat strike leaving their work at the Ford plant in Windsor, Ontario.At a September 12 meeting at the Market Hall Windsor Mayor Art Reaume declared his support for the striking auto workers stating: \"Every member of my city council stands prepared to see that no man or woman is starved in this land of plenty. Heads have been smashed in other places by imported police, but let me pledge to you that it will not happen here.\"During the Ford Strike of 1945, a huge barricade of workers' cars and trucks were assembled on November 4, 1945, along Drouillard and Riverside. Some 1500 to 2000 vehicles reinforced the United Autoworkers picket line and prevented a violent assault by a joint force of  Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers. This police intervention resulted when the Windsor Police Commission (WPC) asked Ontario Attorney-General Leslie Blackwell for additional reinforcements, in an effort to aid in \"maintaining law and order.\"Mayor Reaume, based on his  support for the striking workers had opposed this action. Nonetheless, Blackwell approved the mobilization of 125 OPP officers into Windsor. In addition approximately another 125 RCMP officers were sent by the Government of Canada. The mobilization of some 250 OPP and RCMP officers authorized by Blackwell and Progressive Conservative Premier George Drew went against assurances they had made to Reaume, as David Moulton writes: \"that no police would be sent to Windsor.\" In addition the federal government was preparing armoured tank units in CFB Borden to break up the barricade. On November 5, Windsor City Council issued an ultimatum \"calling for the Ford strikers to remove the motor-car barricade outside the Ford plant or troops may be called in to remove the vehicles.\" Reaume consistently bucked decisions involving the use of police or force against the picket lines and others.\nUnited Auto Workers Local 200 President Roy England declared the WPC's recruitment and mobilization of the OPP and RCMP personnel was an \"attempt at strikebreaking\". In response Chrysler Local 195 voted to walk out in sympathy with the UAW Local 200 strike. The sympathy strike began 5 November 1945; this led to a mass exodus of workers from  twenty-five different plants, as a result another eight thousand workers flocked to the picket lines in support. Cross-Canada solidarity for the striking autoworkers was seen in places such as Sarnia, Brantford, St. Catharines, Oshawa, Fort William, Ottawa, Kitchener, Hamilton, and even as far away as Nova Scotia.

It is 47 miles (76 km) long and forms most of the county boundary between Suffolk to the north, and Essex to the south. It rises in eastern Cambridgeshire, passes to the east of Haverhill, through Cavendish, Sudbury, Bures, Nayland, Stratford St Mary and Dedham. It becomes tidal just before Manningtree in Essex and joins the North Sea at Harwich.\nThe origins of its name are unclear, but several possibilities have been proposed by scholars. The entire non-tidal river above Manningtree is designated as the  Dedham Vale National Landscape, formerly known as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It has been painted by a number of prominent artists, including John Constable and Thomas Gainsborough.\nThe river was improved for navigation following the passing of an Act of Parliament in 1705. Locks were built to enable lighters to reach the town of Sudbury. Most of the locks were associated with mills, and the original 13 flash locks and 13 pound locks were replaced by 15 pound locks in the 19th century. The river was reasonably profitable at the beginning of the 19th century, but the advent of the railways led to a steady decline from 1852 onwards. Attempts to abandon it were thwarted by legal difficulties, but in 1914 the River Stour Navigation Company declared itself bankrupt, and the river soon became moribund. \nFrom 1928 onwards, the river became a major source of drinking water, with South East Essex Waterworks (now Essex and Suffolk Water) extracting water at Langham and then Stratford St Mary pumping stations. As the demand for water grew, the Ely-Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme was implemented, with water from the River Great Ouse discharged into the upper reaches of the river, and extracted again by the pumping stations. A third extraction point was added near Brantham, so that volumes of water flowing through Flatford could be maintained at a higher level for the benefit of tourists. To prevent salt water entering the river valley, sluices and a barrage were built at Cattawade, preventing boats from entering the river from the estuary.\nThe River Stour Trust was set up in 1968 to campaign for greater use of the river for navigation. It has worked to refurbish four locks, and to run boat trips from Flatford and Sudbury. The river can be used by unpowered craft between Sudbury and Cattawade, but powered boats are normally only allowed between Sudbury and Henny Mill, although the Trust has permission to run an electric boat at Flatford. Canoes and kayaks have to be portaged around the former locks where these have been replaced by fixed weirs and sluices.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "131_72660", "text": "The name is of ambiguous and disputed origin.\nOn one theory, the name Stour derives from the Celtic sturr meaning \"strong\". However, the river-name Stour, common in England, does not occur at all in Wales; Crawford noted two tributaries of the Po River near Turin, spelled Stura. In Germany the Stoer is a tributary of the River Elbe. According to Brewer's Britain and Ireland the Stour is pronounced differently in different cases: the Kentish and East Anglian Stours rhyme with tour; the Oxfordshire Stour is sometimes rhymes with mower, sometimes with hour, and the Worcestershire Stour always rhymes with hour. Locally, the River Stour dividing Essex from Suffolk does not have a uniform pronunciation, varying from stowr to stoor.As against that, stour is a Middle English word with two distinct meanings and derivations, still current enough to appear in most substantial dictionaries. As an adjective, with Germanic roots, it signifies \"large, powerful\" (in present-day Scandinavian languages stor means \"big, great\"). As a noun, from medieval French roots, it signifies \"tumult, commotion; confusion\" or an \"armed battle or conflict\". Wiktionary also adds \"blowing or deposit of dust\", the primary definition in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, which adds that this is a northern English and Scottish usage of uncertain derivation. In 2006 it has been suggested that an Old European river-name was taken for an Old English adjective and that stour came to represent one pole of a structural opposition, with blyth at the opposite pole, allowing Anglo-Saxons to classify rivers on a continuum of fierceness.The Victorian etymologist Isaac Taylor proposed a very simple solution: that Stour derives from d\u0175r, the Welsh word for water.It is quite possible that the various Stours do not share a common origin and that they need to be considered in their own terms rather than as a single problem.

Founded and opened in 1934, it holds collections from the mid-19th century that were  amassed substantially by major American art and sculpture collectors, including William Thompson Walters and his son Henry Walters. William Walters began collecting when he moved to Paris as a nominal Confederate loyalist at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, and Henry Walters refined the collection and made arrangements for the construction what ultimately was Walters Art Museum. \nAfter allowing the Baltimore public to occasionally view his father's and his growing added collections at his West Mount Vernon Place mansion during the late 1800s, Henry Walters arranged for an elaborate stone palazzo-styled structure to be built for this purpose in 1905\u20131909, located a block south of the Walters mansion on West Monument Street/Mount Vernon Place, on the northwest corner of North Charles Street at West Centre Street.\nThe mansion and gallery were also just south and west of the landmark Washington Monument in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, just north of the downtown business district and northeast of Cathedral Hill. Upon his 1931 death, Henry Walters bequeathed the entire collection of then more than 22,000 works, the original Charles Street Gallery building, and his adjacent townhouse/mansion just across the alley to the north on West Mount Vernon Place to the City of Baltimore, \"for the benefit of the public\". The collection includes masterworks of ancient Egypt, Greek sculpture and Roman sarcophagi, medieval ivories, illuminated manuscripts, Renaissance bronzes, Old Master European and 19th-century paintings, Chinese ceramics and bronzes, Art Deco jewelry, and ancient Near East, Mesopotamian, or ancient Middle East items. Dorothy Miner became its first Keeper of Manuscripts in 1934 and held the post until her death in 1973.\nIn 2000, \"The Walters Art Gallery\" changed its long-time name to \"The Walters Art Museum\" to reflect its image as a large public institution and eliminate confusion among some of the increasing out-of-state visitors. The following year, \"The Walters\" (as it is often known locally) reopened its original main building after a dramatic three-year physical renovation and replacement of internal utilities and infrastructure. The Archimedes Palimpsest was on loan to the Walters Art Museum from a private collector for conservation and spectral imaging studies.\nStarting on October 1, 2006, the museum was enabled to make admission free to all, year-round, as a result of substantial grants given by Baltimore City and the surrounding suburban Baltimore County arts agencies and authorities.  In 2012, \"The Walters\" released nearly 20,000 of its own images of its collections on a Creative Commons license, and collaborated in  their upload to the world-wide web and the Internet on Wikimedia Commons.

The province had only recently been added to the Aztec Empire through conquest, and when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s arrived in the region (now the Mexican state of Veracruz) in 1519, one of his first acts was to overthrow Aztec dominion by seizing Aztec tribute collectors in the town of Quiahuiztlan and only returning them after a personal request from the Aztec Emperor. He then routed the Aztec garrison at the town of Tizapancingo and returned the state to the native Totonacs under their leader Tlacochcalcatl of Cempoala.To restore the province to Aztec control, Moctezuma despatched Qualpopoca with instructions to defeat the Totonacs and their Spanish allies. Arriving in October 1519, Qualpopoca demanded that the Totonac towns pay their regular tribute to the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. The towns appealed to the Spanish garrisons at Villa Rica and Veracruz and Juan de Escalante, the conquistador then in command, warned Qualpopoca not to threaten the Totonacs and demanded gold as recompense. Qualpopoca took no notice and continued to organise reprisals against Totonac villages that had not paid tribute.

The population of the city proper is 67,544; that of the urban area is 144,625 (2020). Calais overlooks the Strait of Dover, the narrowest point in the English Channel, which is only 34 km (21 mi) wide here, and is the closest French town to England.  The White Cliffs of Dover can easily be seen on a clear day from Calais.  Calais is a major port for ferries between France and England, and since 1994, the Channel Tunnel has linked nearby Coquelles to Folkestone by rail.\nBecause of its position, Calais  has been a major port and an important centre for transport and trading with England since the Middle Ages. Calais came under English control after Edward III of England captured the city in 1347, followed by a treaty in 1360 that formally assigned Calais to English rule.  Calais grew into a thriving centre for wool production, and came to be called the \"brightest jewel in the English crown\" because of its importance as the gateway for the tin, lead, lace and wool trades (or \"staples\"). Calais remained under English control until its capture by France in 1558.\nDuring World War II, the town was virtually razed to the ground: in May 1940, it was a strategic bombing target of the invading German forces who took it during the siege of Calais.  The Germans built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles at England.\nThe old part of the town, Calais-Nord, is on an artificial island surrounded by canals and harbours. The modern part of the town, St-Pierre, lies to the south and south-east. In the centre of the old town is the Place d'Armes, in which stands the Tour du Guet, or watch-tower, a structure built in the 13th century, which was used as a lighthouse until 1848 when a new lighthouse was built by the port. South east of the Place is the church of Notre-Dame, built during the English occupancy of Calais. Arguably, it is the only church built in the English perpendicular style in all of France. In this church, former French President Charles de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux. South of the Place and opposite the Parc St Pierre is the H\u00f4tel-de-ville (the town hall), and the belfry from the early 20th century. Today, Calais is visited by more than 10 million annually. Aside from being a key transport hub, Calais is also a notable fishing port and a centre for fish marketing, and some 3,000 people are still employed in the lace industry for which the town is also famed.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The new abbey remained small and struggled until the first half of the 13th century, when a number of donations allowed it to expand.  In 1233 it owned land in Frienisberg, Allenwil, Ried, Tedlingen, Niederwiler, Werd, G\u00e4serz bei Ins and Montils bei Nugerol.

Starting in the middle of the 13th century the economy of the monastery began to slowly change.  It moved away from land rents and now began to survive on tithes and offerings.  In the second half of the 13th century, the abbey founded the nunneries of Fraubrunnen, Steinen and Tedlingen.In 1386, the Abbey tied itself closely to Bern, when it accepted Bernese citizenship for its monks and farmers.  This close connection with Bern led to the Abbey's downfall.  When Bern embraced the Protestant Reformation, many Bernese monasteries, including Frienisberg, were secularized.  The last abbot, Urs Hirsinger, fled to Hauterive in the Canton of Fribourg rather than remain in Bern.  In 1534, the abbey church was demolished.

The Alliance is often credited with forcing France to return most of their gains at Aix-la-Chapelle, whereas the terms had already been agreed by Louis and Leopold in January 1668. In the longer term, Breda was the point when the English and Dutch came to view France as a greater threat than each other; whilst Charles' preference for a French alliance led to the 1670 Secret Treaty of Dover, the long-term trend was against him. Support for re-asserting English naval power provided limited backing in the Third Anglo-Dutch War but ended once that had been achieved.The treaty disappointed Orangists by failing to restore the House of Orange or allow exiles home, as promised by Charles. When Zeeland and Friesland, in response to the French advance, proposed William be made Captain-General of the Dutch States Army, the States of Holland responded on 5 August with the Perpetual Edict. This abolished the position of Stadholder of Holland, while a second resolution agreed to oppose that any confederate Captain-General or Admiral-General would become stadtholder of another province. Since the army was viewed as an Orangist power base, spending on it was deliberately minimised; this had catastrophic effects in 1672.Breda was also a success for Sweden, who used their position as mediators to improve the Elbing provisions, break the Dutch-Danish agreement and join the Triple Alliance. The Spanish regained Franche-Comt\u00e9 and most of the Spanish Netherlands; more significantly, the Dutch now viewed them as a better neighbour than an ambitious France. Overall, the Dutch considered Breda and the creation of the Alliance a diplomatic triumph; the period immediately following is often considered the high point of the Dutch Golden Age.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The view into the distance from the Wartgesberg (mountain) as far as the Altburg and the heights of the Hunsr\u00fcck was used by the Romans, who built watchtowers on its heights.\nEmperor Heinrich VI, who was the great Emperor Barbarossa's son, transferred lordship over Struhna and the estate of Drucksbersch (Trautzberg) to Springiersbach Abbey. This monastery maintained a monasterial estate here with huge forest and land areas. The estate buildings stood in what is today's outlying centre of Sprink. Even today, Springiersbach's coat of arms can be found preserved on a house in Sprink.\nAmong the places named in a confirmation document issued by Heinrich VI to Abbot Absalon von Springiersbach are cropfields and meadows at Struhna. In 1297, Count Heinrich of Luxembourg enfeoffed the knight Richard, Lord of Daun, with the tithes from Stroin. In 1299, the fief was expanded to include the whole village, which hitherto had only been an allodial holding.\nA newly built house \u2013 a fortified one \u2013 was owned in 1336 by Aegidius, Lord of Daun, who, because of this house, had to assume obligations to the Archbishop. In later centuries, the monastery's estate was forsaken. The lands and woods were sold off, and bought up by the villagers. The estate buildings in Sprink were acquired by three families. Even today, there are agricultural businesses being run there.\nIn the Middle Ages, Strohn was also the site of a high court.\nIn the 19th century, Strohn found itself under the lordship of the Count of Daun and thereby belonged to the County of Daun. A great fire struck the village in 1760, and it burnt down utterly. Only one house was left, the Justenhaus owned by the family Schmitz. Even the church's nave burnt down; only the tower remained standing. From inside, the old Marien Glocke (bell) still sounds. It bears the year 1483 and this inscription, in archaic German: Maria hei\u00dfen ich, alle Weder verdriffen ich Claus von Enen gos mich (\"Maria is my name, all weather I drive away, Claus von Enen poured me\").\nDuring the time of French rule, Strohn was the seat of a mairie (\"mayoralty\") in the Canton of Manderscheid and the Arrondissement of Pr\u00fcm, and even into Prussian times, this was still a B\u00fcrgermeisterei (also \"mayoralty\"). On 22 August 1841, with ministerial permission, the B\u00fcrgermeisterei of Strohn was amalgamated with that of Gillenfeld.

Callowhill is named for Callowhill Street, which was named after Hannah Callowhill Penn, William Penn's second wife and de facto proprietor of Pennsylvania after William Penn.  \nCallowhill was formerly home to large-scale manufacturing and other industries, of which an architectural history has been left in the form of grand old abandoned factories. During the 1970s and 1980s, the population of Callowhill plummeted, and although numbers are rising, it is a fairly unpopulated section of the city compared to surrounding neighborhoods. Recently developers have started to employ adaptive reuse projects, converting them into loft style housing; so much so that many have termed the neighborhood \"The Loft District\". In 2010 the Callowhill Industrial Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places.Callowhill is physically cut off from its neighbor to the south, Chinatown, by the Vine Street Expressway. This has largely prevented Chinese businesses from spreading north, although some industrial and storage uses by the Chinese community have been placed in Callowhill. Vine Street is also blamed for the abrupt drop in pedestrian life above Chinatown, and the struggle faced by efforts to redevelop this section of the city that lies between Center City and North Philadelphia.\nThe former Reading Railroad train trestle, the Reading Viaduct, is a defining feature of the Callowhill neighborhood. Neighborhood groups proposed that the abandoned structure be maintained as a public park. The Reading Viaduct park plan gained momentum in 2009 when Philadelphia's Center City District (CCD), and its influential president Paul Levy, became enamored of the idea and ultimately became a partner to help manage the project. CCD announced on Tuesday, February 6, 2018 that the first phase of the quarter-mile-long, elevated park would open in spring 2018.

In 1914, the company began to produce a marine diesel engine, requiring more workers. To meet labor needs, F-M brought in black factory workers, many from the Jim Crow South. Six families came in 1915 - 250 by 1917. Many of the arrivals were unskilled laborers, but there were also blacksmiths, molders, oilers, and a foreman.The influx of new workers produced a housing shortage and Fairbanks-Morse worked to solve the problem. Its subsidiary Eclipse Home Makers, Inc. bought the land that Fairbanks Flats now occupies on the west side of the Rock River across from the factory and planned the rather plain flats there, aiming to contain \"the large number of negroes in one place\" on what was then the edge of town. Meanwhile, the company was planning a separate development for its white employees with single-family homes and curved streets - Eclipse Park - designed by New York architect George B. Post. Segregation wasn't a huge concern then, but the purchase of land for Fairbanks Flats was, because F-M snapped it up just before the city planned to acquire it to be part of a city park/boulevard system. Many felt the tract of land was key to the park system, and the city threatened to condemn the land to stop the land deal. The mayor of Beloit warned that the project could create \"class bitterness that will be enduring and most undesirable for years to come.\" Nevertheless, F-M went ahead with its project.Construction began in late 1917.  Four apartment blocks were built - each with six 2-story apartments. Each building has walls of concrete block, shed roofs, and parapets topping the side walls. The double doors in the front middle of each building is sheltered by a canopy. A simple band of protruding block connects the tops of the windows on each story, but otherwise the buildings are not decorated.In following years, Fairbanks-Morse brought in J.D. Stevenson from Tuskegee Institute to start a YMCA for black youths nearby. The apartments came to be called the Edgewater Flats, but were still administered by F-M officials as late as 1929. Ownership changed after WWII, and people outside of Fairbanks-Morse could rent there. Nevertheless, the Flats remained predominantly black. The NRHP nomination considers the Flats significant as \"an example of the role of private corporations in community planning during an era of rapid industrialization\" and as \"the nucleus of Beloit's twentieth century black community.\"\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "131_74426", "text": "Yurigaoka housing complex", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia, with the majority of Perth's metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp. The city has expanded outward from the original British settlements on the Swan River, upon which its central business district and port of Fremantle are situated.\nPerth was founded by Captain James Stirling in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony. The city is situated on the traditional lands of the Whadjuk Noongar people, where Aboriginal Australians have lived for at least 45,000 years. Perth was named after the city of Perth in Scotland. Perth was proclaimed as a city by Queen Victoria in 1856, although the City of Perth currently governs only a small area around the central business district. Substantial population growth occurred during the late 19th-century Western Australian gold rushes, and the city has continued to expand, particularly after World War II due to a high net migration rate. Post-war immigrants were predominantly from the British Isles and Southern Europe, while more recent arrivals see a growing population of Asian descent. During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, a series of mining booms in various regions of Western Australia propelled Perth into the role of the regional headquarters for significant mining operations.\nRanked as one of the world's most liveable cities, Perth was classified by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network as a Beta global city in 2020. As of 2021, Perth is divided into 30 local government areas, comprising over 350 suburbs. The metropolitan contours span 115 kilometres (71 mi) from Two Rocks in the north to Singleton in the south, and 45 kilometres (28 mi) from the west coast to Sawyers Valley in the east. Beyond the central business district, predominant urban centres within the metropolitan area include Armadale, Fremantle, Joondalup, Midland, and Rockingham. Most of those were originally established as separate settlements and retained a distinct identity after being subsumed into the wider metropolitan area. Mandurah, Western Australia's second-largest city, forms a conurbation with Perth along the coastline. Despite this, it is generally regarded as an independent city for practical purposes.\nPerth features several important public buildings, as well as cultural and heritage sites. The city has various notable government buildings, including the Parliament House, Government House, the Supreme Court Buildings and the Perth Mint.

In 1966, voters approved the creation of the Pasadena Area Junior College District. The name was subsequently changed to the Pasadena Area Community College District. Pasadena City College is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, an institutional accrediting body recognized by the Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation and the U.S. Department of Education.The Shatford Library is a direct descendant of the original Pasadena High School library that originally occupied the campus. The $16.5-million Shatford Library opened September 7, 1993, and holds 133,024 volumes in the general book collection, over 300 periodical subscriptions (plus over 2,000 titles in electronic databases) 7,338 audio cassettes, 1,019 paperbacks, 661 CDs and software, 404 volumes in the Special Services collection, and 1,186 videocassettes. Walter T. Shatford II, is the attorney for whom the library was named in recognition of his four decades of service on the school's board and his donations. He was also active in the Civil Rights Movement.On March 20, 2003, on the day the United States launched Operation Iraqi Freedom, many students led by the Students for Social Justice, protested on campus against the war. Protesters went through the administration building requesting students to join their cause. Three students were arrested by campus police. That same year, voters approved a bond measure for about $150 million that improved campus facilities. A significant portion of these funds were earmarked for the construction of a new building to house the college's art and music departments. The Alumni Commons, the Aquatic Center, the Boone Sculpture Garden, and the Galloway Plaza have all replaced what were once campus parking lots. A new fourth floor parking structure (Lot 5) and a new bus parking area were completed in 2005.\nIn 2007, many services at the school had to relocate pending demolition of their previous facilities. These included the college bookstore, Student Affairs, Associated Students, the student business services, the campus police and the offices of the school newspaper The Courier. A groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the new Industrial and Technology building, Campus Center and Bookstore took place in October 2007. The Campus Center and Bookstore opened in August 2009. The school is one of the few community colleges with its own observatory, planetarium, and seismograph. Additionally, in 2007 demonstrators from Philadelphia-based Repent America demonstrated on campus, leading to tensions between demonstrators and some students. PCC students, some who were journalism students and staff members of the campus newspaper, PCC Courier, were involved in the May Day melee at MacArthur Park. Later that year, students and faculty held a rally in support of the Jena Six. Some students were beaten and arrested at the MacArthur Park immigrant rights demonstration on May 1, 2007.During 2012 and 2013, the school became embroiled in conflict between students and faculty and the campus administration. On August 29, 2012, the PCC Board unilaterally cancelled the subsequent six-week winter session. One student was arrested at this board meeting. Organized by a newly formed group called Coalition of Students and Faculty for Student Achievement, a rally during the first week back of the illegitimate new Spring semester kicked off a steady wave of student and faculty activism. Eventually, course sections were cut, student transfers to four-year institutions were delayed, overall full-time student enrollments were reduced, and Proposition 30 monies allotted to the school were jeopardized. According to the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, 2012\u20132013 had the lowest full-time enrollments in 17 years at 20,219; Spring 2013 had the lowest full-time enrollments in 10 years at 9838 students.  The Faculty Association filed an unfair labor practice on the District for canceling winter abruptly and won in November 2013. The district filed an appeal to the ruling, thus prolonging the orders to rescind the trimester calendar and return to the status quo while ratcheting up annual 7% compensation to affected employees.In Spring 2013, in an unprecedented move, the Associated Students unanimously censured the administration and passed a vote of no confidence in the school's president, Mark W. Rocha, and collectively called for his immediate ouster. Separately, a vote among full-time faculty members expressed no confidence in Rocha by a margin of 92 percent to 8 percent. The Academic Faculty Senate also voted, 24\u20130, no confidence in the president.The board of trustees remained firm in their support of Rocha, extending his contract another year and giving Rocha a raise. In 2014, however, the faculty maintained its disapproval of the college president's performance as revealed in the faculty-wide evaluation of the PCC President. The negative campus climate has also been a concern with the staff and faculty, which prompted a campus-wide town hall sponsored by the faculty senate. Rocha was named one of Pasadena Weekly's less-than-stellar local \"turkey\" leaders of 2013. After a failed attempt to find work elsewhere, Rocha announced his retirement on August 7, 2014, but later became the Chancellor of San Francisco City College, where after less than three years he was placed on leave in March 2020, according to the San Francisco Examiner.\nIn 2014, the Oscar-winning screenplay writer Dustin Lance Black was invited to speak at commencement, but in a controversial move he was subsequently uninvited by PCC Board of Trustees Anthony Fellow, who said, \"We just don't want to give PCC a bad name.\" According to the Los Angeles Times, \"School officials pretended that Black was never approved as commencement speaker, when in fact they approved him. They said that his brush with a sex scandal has 'no place in public discussion,' when in fact they discussed it with reporters, students and each other.\" The college issued an apology, and later re-extended the invitation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

William Walters began collecting when he moved to Paris as a nominal Confederate loyalist at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, and Henry Walters refined the collection and made arrangements for the construction what ultimately was Walters Art Museum. \nAfter allowing the Baltimore public to occasionally view his father's and his growing added collections at his West Mount Vernon Place mansion during the late 1800s, Henry Walters arranged for an elaborate stone palazzo-styled structure to be built for this purpose in 1905\u20131909, located a block south of the Walters mansion on West Monument Street/Mount Vernon Place, on the northwest corner of North Charles Street at West Centre Street.\nThe mansion and gallery were also just south and west of the landmark Washington Monument in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, just north of the downtown business district and northeast of Cathedral Hill.

The following year, \"The Walters\" (as it is often known locally) reopened its original main building after a dramatic three-year physical renovation and replacement of internal utilities and infrastructure.

By the mid-1990s the Sterling Forest Corporation, a subsidiary of Trygg-Hansa, a Swedish insurance company, held title to 17,500 acres of the forest.  The corporation was actively pursuing development of the property, proposing construction of 14,500 residential units and 7.4 million square feet of commercial and light industrial space.  At risk was a largely undeveloped habitat of eastern hardwood forest, lakes, and streams in the nation's most densely populated metropolitan region.  \nPublic advocacy for conservation of Sterling Forest had existed since the 1950s, but without success.  By the 1990s, this advocacy was centered on the Public/Private Partnership to Save Sterling Forest, a coalition of twenty-nine New York and New Jersey nonprofit organizations chaired by Robert O. Binnewies, Executive Director of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.  The Public/Private Partnership worked for almost a decade to secure funding commitments from the federal government, the State of New Jersey, the State of New York, and private sources to achieve acquisition of most Sterling Forest Corporation holdings.

The first church at Hopperstad was likely a small, wooden stave church that was built during the mid-11th century, possibly around the year 1060. This church was torn down and replaced with the present church during the early- to mid-12th century, possibly between the years 1130 and 1150. In 1982, archaeological evidence was found showing post holes for the large staves that support the idea of a previous church on the site. Again in 1997, a series of samples from the logs were collected for dendrochronological dating of the church. A total of seven samples produced an estimate for the construction ranging from 1034 to 1116 and resulted in no definite conclusion in the age of the church, however, this supports the idea that the materials from the old church were used in the construction of the present church.The medieval timbers of the church bear a significant number of graffiti, carved in runes.No records exist as to what the medieval church actually looked like. There are a variety of sketches showing a nave and chancel. The church did not undergo any major changes until the 1600s. At that time the nave was lengthened to the west, and a bell-tower was added above the new extension. To the east, a new section was added and built out of logs. A new vestibule to the south with its own entrance was also added. In 1723, the church was sold into private ownership at the Norwegian church auction so the King could pay off debts from the Great Northern War.The largest addition to the church came to the north with a log construction. This new part was named the \"new church\" (nykirken). The construction was finished during the 1700s (this area was torn down in around 1875). There are no known images of the interior from this time, but a story written by the priest Niels Dahl, who is assumed to have visited the church in 1824, describes the interior:\n\nThe church has galleries at three levels around all of the walls, that the church [had a rundt alle veggene og at den var lavloftet og t\u00f8mret] with staircases up to the galleries. And the font is placed under the medieval baldaquin. And the walls are painted by numerous quotes from the Holy Scripture in vivid colours.\nIn 1814, this church served as an election church (Norwegian: valgkirke). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway's first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called \"electors\" who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.In the 1870s, the two neighboring Hove Church and Hopperstad Stave Church parishes were both in need of new churches. The issue was first raised by the local parish priest J\u00f8rgen Christian Andreas Gr\u00f8ner who complained about the size of the two churches. Both churches were old and small and due to their age, they were in dire need of improvements. The local villagers believed he was exaggerating and the private owners of the church did not want to spend money on the churches. Soon after, the local priest decided to no longer hold services at the Hopperstad Stave Church since it was so cold and drafty. Within a short period of time, it was decided to merge the two neighboring parishes into one larger parish. On 11 December 1875, a royal decree was issued that ordered the closure of both churches and the construction of a new church in Vik\u00f8yri for the newly created parish. In 1877, the new Vik Church was constructed and the two older churches were taken out of regular use and preserved as historical sites.In 1877, after about 700 years in use, the old church was abandoned. The church had been in very poor condition for many years and three years after its closure, the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments purchased the building in 1880. All of the \"new\" additions were torn down, leaving just the medieval building still standing. Using the Borgund Stave Church as a model, architect Peter Andreas Blix reconstructed the church between 1884 and 1891. During the reconstruction, carved sections were found beneath the floor which indicated that the new church replaced an older church, which was probably built in the latter half of the 11th century. During the reconstruction, the nave and choir were left alone and the apse, corridors, and roof were all rebuilt. All of the newly rebuilt areas were based on similar existing stave churches such as the Borgund Stave Church and the Urnes Stave Church. Since its completion in 1891, the church has been used primarily as a museum, although the parish will still use the church for special occasions.", "hasanswer": false}]}

By 1870, the Cold Lake Post was abandoned.In the late 19th century, a M\u00e9tis road allowance community developed on the lake, known as Cold Lake.The first geological exploration of Kississing Lake was done in 1899 by D. B. Dowling of the Geological Survey of Canada. The discovery of mineral deposits in the Flin Flon area stimulated interest in the whole region, and prospectors worked their way northward to Kississing Lake, guided by M\u00e9tis from the Cold Lake community. In 1923, deposits of copper-zinc sulphides were staked on the east shore of the lake, which were developed into the Sherritt-Gordon Mine. The Town of Sherridon formed nearby. Following the discovery of these minerals, the lake was mapped by the Topographical Survey of Canada in 1928. Around the same time, J. F. Wright of the Geological Survey undertook a further survey, mapping the area around the lake and examining the various deposits that had been discovered up to that time.The Sherridon mine closed in 1951, after having processed approximately 7.7 Mt of pyritic ore.  Weathering of the mine's tailings has released sulphate, metals, and acid into surface and ground water ever since, which run into and contaminated the adjacent Camp Lake. When levels on Camp Lake are high, such as during seasonal spring melts, its rusty-coloured water leaches into the clear blue Kississing Lake. High levels of contaminants have been found in the bottom sediments of Kississing Lake extending over an area of 9.5 square kilometres (3.7 sq mi) from Camp Lake's inflow.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

A new hotel was built on the site in 1880, remaining into the 21st century as The Crafers Inn, but the original building was burned down in 1926. At the time the area at the foot of nearby Mount Lofty was known as the Tiers, infamous for being the haunt of numerous Tiersmen and woodcutters on the run from authorities in Adelaide.The historic Crafers Primary School was first established in the area in 1865 by Mr Edward Smith. The school was initially located in small premises in Atkinson Road, and then moved to its present location in Piccadilly Road in 1928. The historic stone and brick building was opened on 31 August of that year. The late 1970s saw extensive upgrading of the school facilities under Principal Allan Stanley-Smith, including construction of the Ruth Beare Hall in 1976 named after Ruth Beare who taught at the school from 1937 to 1944 and 1947 to 1975.The Church of the Epiphany, Epiphany Place, Crafers has played a prominent role in the life of the district since it was built in 1878 on land donated by Henry Scott.\nFor many years Crafers was well known for being the start point of the South Eastern Freeway linking Adelaide with the town of Murray Bridge, and to the Princes Highway leading to Melbourne.
