Green (bass) renamed the band and decided to use a drum machine for percussion. Melding heavy metal with industrial music and later with electronic music and dub, Godflesh's sound is widely regarded as a foundational influence on other industrial metal and post-metal acts and as significant to both experimental and extreme metal.The band signed to Earache Records in the late 1980s and released their debut album Streetcleaner (1989) to contemporary and lasting acclaim. After the release of their sophomore album Pure (1992) and their major label debut Selfless (1994), they started experimenting with live drums as well as hip hop and breakbeat sounds. The resulting albums, Songs of Love and Hate (1996) and Us and Them (1999), were followed by Hymns (2001), which saw a simplification of the band's style. Shortly after Green's departure in 2002, Broadrick ended Godflesh and pursued various other projects, such as Jesu. Broadrick and Green reformed Godflesh in 2009, releasing A World Lit Only by Fire (2014) and Post Self (2017) to critical acclaim. Their ninth album, Purge, was released in June 2023.\nAs pioneers of industrial metal, Godflesh's early sound was defined by harsh machine beats, production-emphasised bass, distorted guitar and sparse vocals delivered in a low, guttural fashion. The band performed for most of their career as a duo with Broadrick and Green playing over preprogrammed percussion, normally to a backdrop of apocalyptic scenery and Christian iconography. Godflesh's music has been regarded as especially heavy and grim, with Streetcleaner being named by several publications as one of the heaviest and greatest metal albums.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_39306", "text": "Godflesh typically perform as a duo, with Green playing bass and Broadrick providing both guitar and vocals while the percussion is relayed over the speakers, often at a notably high volume. This lineup, however, has not been constant over the band's career. In concerts supporting Streetcleaner, Neville occasionally came onstage and played second guitar, and Hampson did the same for Pure. For the tours in support of Selfless, Songs of Love and Hate and Hymns, the band played with a live drummer, though Broadrick believed this incorporation to be a misstep. In a 2014 interview, he clarified that the percussive additions of Mantia and Parsons brought \"something amazing\" to Godflesh, but that the band's name should have changed so as to not dilute the original focus on machine drums. A handful of other musicians (namely, Mick Harris in 1991; Diarmuid Dalton in 1997, 1999 and 2001; Steve Hough in 1997 and 1999 and both Paul Raven and Jaz Coleman of Killing Joke in 2002) have briefly performed with Godflesh.\nThe band's stage show is, like their music, minimal and focused. Godflesh only occasionally employ a smoke machine, and the lights are generally static; Toby Cook of The Quietus highlighted this unusual approach in a review of a 2014 concert, writing, \"Over-lit and with no dry ice in sight, they look alarmingly exposed\". Images of industrial urban sprawls, Christian iconography and apocalyptic landscapes cycle through the projector. The music itself is presented as noisy and overwhelming, with some critics calling the sound even more cacophonous and dissonant than the band's studio work. Gaps between songs are normally filled with feedback, and the band rarely speak to the crowd. In response to a question about Godflesh's laconic stage presence, Broadrick said, \"I don't communicate with people. We just make music. We come on stage and I don't say anything to anyone. And that alone made people really mad. I find it really bizarre. I can't believe that people would disown a band because I'm not telling them how much I'm going to kick their asses tonight.\"In a 2011 interview, Broadrick called playing live \"a necessary evil\" that is \"so rarely right and so frequently wrong\", but at the same time said that Godflesh \"is probably even more so a live band than it is a recorded band\" because those imperfections only work to accentuate the grinding chaos of the music (which is something that critics have noticed, too).

They consisted of frontman Steve Zodiac (real name Stephen John Hepworth) on guitar  and lead vocals Alan Selway on bass guitar and Gary Pearson on drums. Alan Selway was later replaced by Terry Horbury (previously of Dirty Tricks) on bass guitar.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_39321", "text": "The band were originally formed under the name 'Quo Vardis' (a misspelling of the Latin for 'quo vadis', or 'whither goest thou?'). This was later abbreviated to Vardis. Their first recordings were made at Holyground Studios in Cass Yard, Kirgate, Wakefield. The first ever track laid down on vinyl was titled \"Jiving All Night Long\" with the B-side titled \"Stay with Me\", both penned by Zodiac. This was followed up with a second record, both cover versions, those being  \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (Chuck Berry) and \"Don't Waste My Time\" (Status Quo).\nVardis quickly gained notoriety for their high energy live performances, the unique approach of incorporating elements of 1970s glam rock and heavy metal music and frontman Steve Zodiac's searing Fender Telecaster sound. Zodiac was reputable for playing Vardis concerts barefoot and bare chested, his look completed by long, naturally ice-blonde hair.They took the unorthodox approach of comprising their debut album, 100MPH (1980), of entirely live recordings. This is largely considered to be their finest hour and gained the band a large following early on in their career. They were invited to play the Heavy Metal Holocaust music festival in August 1981 alongside Mot\u00f6rhead, Ozzy Osbourne and Triumph. Around 30,000 heavy metal fans were estimated to have attended with the PA reportedly reaching new heights of amplification at over 100,000 watts.Their second album, released in April 1981 and called The World's Insane, featured a cover version of Hawkwind's \"Silver Machine\", and featured bagpipes played by Judd Lander, making it one of the few heavy metal albums of that time to ever feature bagpipes.

It was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Yamato Transport and the Nippon Television Network, and stars the voices of Minami Takayama, Rei Sakuma and Kappei Yamaguchi. The story follows Kiki, a young witch who moves to the port city of Koriko with her cat Jiji and starts a flying courier service.\nIn 1987, Group Fudosha asked Kadono's publishers for the rights to the novel to be made into a film by either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. Production began near the release of My Neighbor Totoro (1988). Miyazaki initially worked as producer, but took over directing from Sunao Katabuchi as he became more involved in the project. As the novel is based on a fictional northern European country, Miyazaki and his team traveled to locations such as Visby, Sweden, to research its landscape. Miyazaki altered the story, adding new scenes to emphasize the theme of independence and growing up. According to Miyazaki, the film portrays the gulf between independence and reliance among teenage Japanese girls.Kiki's Delivery Service was released in Japan on July 29, 1989, by the Toei Company. It was the first Studio Ghibli film to be successful on initial release, grossing a total of \u00a54.3 billion ($31 million). It received critical acclaim and multiple awards.\nAn English dub was produced by Streamline Pictures for Japan Airlines international flights in 1989.

Its plot follows a deranged man who, after undergoing an experimental medical procedure, is released from a New York City psychiatric hospital and embarks on a road trip to Florida with the intent of murdering his ex-wife and child.\nScavolini, an Italian director who had previously worked making hardcore pornography films, developed the idea for Nightmare after reading newspaper articles about psychiatric patients who had been administered powerful drugs that altered their behavior. He completed the film's screenplay over a two-week period while vacationing in Cocoa Beach, Florida, where he chose to set the majority of the film. The film was shot on location in Florida and New York City in late 1980.\nReleased by 21st Century Film Corporation in the fall of 1981, Nightmare was met by significant criticism for its graphic violence and sexuality: The Motion Picture Association of America granted it an X rating, and it was later banned in the United Kingdom (where it was released under the alternate title Nightmares in a Damaged Brain) and prosecuted for obscenity as a \"video nasty\". Three executives for the film's British distribution company faced legal action for releasing the film in its original cut, violating the ruling of  the British Board of Film Classification, which mandated that approximately 48 seconds of footage be excised before the film could be screened for the public.

In the period from 1746 to 1756, he worked in England, where he painted many views of London and other sites, including Warwick Castle and Alnwick Castle.

In concert, DVS Mindz was backed by several different DJs, including Def DJ, DJ Vee, and Kutaculous. The band's sound was sparse, with raw beats and furious, nonstop rhyming from all members. DVS Mindz had catchy material, but many of its songs featured no chorus, just a sparse beat and verse after verse from the MCs. The band's lyrics were packed with inside jokes, mythology, pop-culture references, puns, numerology, religion, violence, and obscure references to the group's history. Each member also had alter egos and pseudonyms, and they sometimes rapped in those voices (For example, Str8Jakkett had another alter ego known as \"Wrexx\").

Francis \"Frank\" Donovan (Jon Tenney) was the patrol sergeant who presided every day over the morning shift assignments he gave to the uniformed officers. Donovan was an informant for the hated Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB), and secretly reported to Lt. Stan Jonas (James B. Sikking), who, early in the series, transferred from being an IAB officer to the precinct captain after the officious Captain Lou Zerola (Bradford English) transferred to precinct maintenance. It was later revealed in the season that Donovan became an undercover informant 15 years earlier for IAB to protect his father, a retired cop living in Florida, from indictment for corruption.\nIn the pilot episode, a psychotic gunman named Hopkins went on a shooting rampage outside the police station, killing a number of policemen and innocent bystanders. He was wounded in the shootout and disarmed and handcuffed by Officer Doyle, who later stopped the other cops from beating Hopkins to death and left his barely breathing self in the interview room alone. It was later revealed that Ann-Marie Kersey (Yancy Butler), a policewoman whose boyfriend was one of the victims of the shooting spree, slipped into the room where Hopkins was and kicked him several times in the chest, leading to Hopkins suffering a fatal heart attack. The killer's family pressured the city to launch an Internal Affairs investigation as they were convinced that he was murdered by cops in retaliation for his killing rampage.

Melee weapons can also be thrown at targets at any point in the game. Weapons are randomly generated and positioned in predetermined locations as well as found on some enemies; they have unique stats that are generally based on the player's current level. Each weapon can be upgraded three times to increase its stats, and most weapons can be \"modded\" \u2013 customized based on a blueprint to add special features, such as nails or electrified blades, and poison. These weapons will wear out from constant usage and require repairs and careful use, especially because once a weapon becomes damaged beyond a certain point it becomes much more expensive to repair.\nThere is also a stamina bar, meaning that after a set amount of physical action, such as running, jumping, or swinging a weapon, the character needs to stop to regain his or her stamina. Fighting with a high-level zombie will result in the player often running out of stamina and potentially being killed. The game features \"special class\" zombies, which are more powerful than the standard zombie. Players need to use flashlights in dark areas and during night-time sections, adding suspense.Zombies in the game have different abilities, such as the Walkers being Romero-style zombies and the Infected being 28 Days Later-style running zombies. There are also other special zombies in the style of Left 4 Dead.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39501", "text": "The night after a party, four playable main characters (hereafter referred to as \"the survivors\"): rapper Sam B., hotel receptionist and spy for the Hong Kong Government Xian Mei, former American football-star Logan Carter, and ex-police officer Purna Jackson\u2014are awakened by a voice over the emergency intercom system directing them to evacuate the hotel. They discover that the majority of the population have been overcome by a contagious and infectious plague, turning them into psychopathic, flesh-eating creatures. Briefly overcome by one of the infected, they are rescued by lifeguard John Sinamoi.\nThe survivors discover that they are apparently immune from infection, and \"The Voice\" out of contact, the survivors are tasked by Sinamoi to try to find supplies and contact the outside world. As it becomes obvious that the resort lacks enough supplies to survive for long, Sinamoi instead has them travel to the city of Moresby to find help. The survivors take along Jin, the daughter of the bitten mechanic who modifies an armoured car they use to break out of the resort.\n\nUpon arriving in Moresby, after taking down a new special infected known as the Ram, the survivors aid a holdout at a barricaded church. Directed first to the wealthier sections of town, they ultimately raid a supermarket under the control of \"Raskol\" gangs. Jin tries to offer supplies to another Raskol faction, in the abandoned police station, who capture and rape her. The gang kill the Raskol members and rescue Jin, but her actions anger Sam.\nUpon their return to the resort, the survivors make contact with \"The Voice\": Colonel Ryder White, a Banoi Island Defense Force (BIDF) commander who is currently trapped in a high-security prison located on a remote island, only accessible through the jungle. He states that due to the characters' immunity he could create a cure/vaccine, and in-turn save his bitten wife. White directs the survivors into the jungles of Banoi having them find a smuggler named Mowen who can reach the prison.\nMowen stonewalls the survivors on the prison, but does take them to a lab studying the plague. Their researchers determine the infection is a mutation of Kuru that originated from the indigenous population. At their behest, the survivors collect a tissue sample from a native mummy to better examine the pre-mutation form of Kuru and rescue a native woman, Yerema, who was about to be sacrificed by her tribe.\nMowen finally agrees to take the survivors to the prison. After the survivors complete the preparations that he and Jin requested, they hurry back to the lab when White reports that somethings' gone wrong. They find the zombies the scientists were studying were accidentally released, with only Yerema still alive. Rescuing Yerema and retrieving what appears to be a prototype vaccine, the survivors proceed to the prison island.\nThe survivors initially help the surviving prisoners to arm themselves in exchange for reaching White, but when White finally contacts them again he urges them to abandon the prisoners and proceed to him. The prisoners' holdout eventually falls and Mowen dies helping Jin and Yerema escape. As the survivors are about to reach White, however, they are hit with a knockout gas inside their elevator. Awoken by a tech-savvy prisoner named Kevin, they learn that White stole the vaccine and intends to flee with his wife and call in a nuclear strike to purge the island.\nRacing to the roof helipad, the survivors find themselves held by White at gunpoint. Jin, disgusted by White's plan, releases White's now-zombified wife from her restraints, and she bites White on the wrist. White kills his wife and shoots Jin dead, then injects himself with the vaccine, only for it to accelerate and amplify his own mutation. The survivors kill White, then finally escape Banoi with his helicopter as Kevin intones that things will never be the same.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Minogue is the highest-selling female recording artist from Australia, having sold over 80 million records worldwide. She has been recognised for reinventing herself in music as well as fashion, and is referred to by the European press as the \"Princess of Pop\" and a style icon. Her accolades include two Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards and eighteen ARIA Music Awards.\nBorn and raised in Melbourne, Minogue first achieved recognition starring as Charlene Robinson in the Australian soap opera Neighbours (1986\u20131988). She began her music career in the late 1980s, releasing four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums under PWL. By the early 1990s, Minogue had amassed several top ten singles in Australia and the UK, including \"The Loco-Motion\", \"I Should Be So Lucky\", \"Especially for You\", \"Hand on Your Heart\" and \"Better the Devil You Know\". Taking more creative control over her music, she signed with Deconstruction Records in 1993 and released the albums Kylie Minogue (1994) and Impossible Princess (1997).\nBy joining Parlophone in 1999, Minogue returned to mainstream dance-oriented music with Light Years (2000), including the number-one hits \"Spinning Around\" and \"On a Night Like This\". The follow-up, Fever (2001), was an international breakthrough for Minogue, becoming her best-selling album to date. Its lead single, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" became one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, selling over five million units. Follow up singles, \"In Your Eyes\" and \"Love at First Sight\" became hits as well. She continued reinventing her image and experimenting with a range of genres on her subsequent albums, which spawned successful singles such as \"Slow\", \"I Believe in You\", \"2 Hearts\" and \"All the Lovers\". In 2017, she partnered with BMG Rights Management, with \"Dancing\" (2018) as their first release. In the following years, Minogue became the only female artist to have a number-one album and a top ten single, from the 1980s to the 2020s in the UK charts, with Disco (2020) and \"Padam Padam\" (2023) respectively.\nIn film, Minogue made her debut in The Delinquents (1989), and appeared in Street Fighter (1994), Moulin Rouge! (2001), Holy Motors (2012) and San Andreas (2015). In reality television, she appeared as a judge on The Voice UK and The Voice Australia both in 2014. Her other ventures include product endorsements, books, perfumes, charitable work and a wine brand. Minogue's achievements include being an ARIA Hall of Fame inductee, Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Chevalier (knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and an honorary Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_39560", "text": "Minogue explained she first became interested in pop music during her adolescence: \"I first got into pop music in 1981, I'd say. It was all about Prince, Adam + the Ants, that whole New Romantic period. Prior to that, it was the Jackson 5, Donna Summer, and my dad's records \u2013 the Stones and Beatles.\" She would also listen to the records of Olivia Newton-John and ABBA. She said she \"wanted to be\" Newton-John while growing up. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue during the early years of her music career with the observation: \"She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna ... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her.\" Minogue came to prominence in the music scene as a bubblegum pop singer and was deemed a \"product of the Stock Aitken Waterman Hit Factory\". Australian musician Nick Cave, who worked with her, was a major influence on her artistic development. She told The Guardian: \"He's definitely infiltrated my life in beautiful and profound ways.\" Throughout her career, her work was also influenced by British singer-songwriter-producer Cathy Dennis, British record producer D Mob, British band Scritti Politti, Icelandic singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rk, British rapper Tricky, Irish rock band U2 and Japanese pop band Pizzicato Five, among others.\nMinogue has been known for her soft soprano vocal range. Tim Sendra of AllMusic reviewed her album Aphrodite and said Minogue's \"slightly nasal, girl next door vocals serve her needs perfectly.\" According to Fiona MacDonald from Madison magazine, Minogue \"has never shied away from making some brave but questionable artistic decisions\". In musical terms, Minogue has worked with many genres in pop and dance music. However, her signature music has been contemporary disco music. Her first studio albums with Stock, Aitken, and Waterman present a more bubblegum pop influence, with many critics comparing her to American singer-songwriter Madonna. Chris True from AllMusic, reviewed her debut album, Kylie and found her music \"standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum\", however he stated she presented the most personality of any 1980s recording artist. He said of her third album Rhythm of Love, from the early 1990s, \"The songwriting is stronger, the production dynamic, and Kylie seems more confident vocally.\" At the time of her third studio album, \"She began to trade in her cutesy, bubblegum pop image for a more mature one, and in turn, a more sexual one.\" Chris True stated during her relationship with Australian singer-actor Michael Hutchence, \"her shedding of the near-virginal fa\u00e7ade that dominated her first two albums, began to have an effect, not only on how the press and her fans treated her, but in the evolution of her music.\"Her self-titled fifth studio album, primarily a dance-pop album integrating elements of R&B and adult contemporary music saw a shift in her music. Chris True of AllMusic stated the album is a \"remarkable change from Minogue's previous teen pop material\" and the \"start of a second phase\" in her music career. From her work on her sixth studio album, Impossible Princess, her songwriting and musical content began to change. She was constantly writing down words, exploring the form and meaning of sentences. She had written lyrics before, but called them \"safe, just neatly rhymed words and that's that\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine said the album bears a resemblance to Madonna's Ray of Light (1998). He said she took inspiration from \"both the Britpop and electronica movements of the mid-'90s\", saying \"Impossible Princess is the work of an artist willing to take risks\".Her seventh studio album, Light Years is a disco-influenced dance-pop record, with AllMusic's Chris True calling it \"Arguably one of the best disco records since the '70s\". True stated her eighth studio album, Fever, \"combines the disco-diva comeback of Light Years with simple dance rhythms\". Her ninth studio album, Body Language, was quite different from her musical experiments in the past as it was a \"successful\" attempt at broadening her sound with electro and hip-hop for instance. Incorporating styles of dance music with funk, disco and R&B, the album was listed on Q's \"Best Albums of 2003\".Critics said Minogue's tenth studio album X did not feature enough \"consistency\" and Chris True called the tracks \"cold, calculated dance-pop numbers.\" Tim Sendra of AllMusic said her eleventh album, Aphrodite, \"rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems\" and \"the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop that really is her strong suit.\" Sendra found Aphrodite \"One of her best, in fact.\" Kiss Me Once, her twelfth studio album has been described by critics as her return to contemporary pop music.Her fourteenth studio album, Golden was heavily influenced by country music, although maintaining her dance-pop sensibilities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote \"Golden further bolsters Minogue's reputation for taking risks\u2014and artfully sets the stage for her inevitable disco comeback.\" For her fifteenth studio album, Disco, she began\nto audio engineer her own music due to the restrictions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39561", "text": "Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception she had not \"paid her dues\" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on the soap opera Neighbours. She acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\"In 1993, Australian director Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with American actress Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, she has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \"look\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected. Her progression from the wholesome \"girl next door\" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans. Her music video for \"Spinning Around\" led to some media outlets referring to her as \"SexKylie\", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos. In September 2002, she was ranked 27 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists list. She was also named one of the 100 Hottest Women of All-Time by Men's Health in 2013. William Baker described her status as a sex symbol as a \"double edged sword\", observing \"we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record. But now it has become in danger of eclipsing what she actually is: a pop singer.\" After 20 years as a performer, she was described by BBC's Fiona Pryor as a fashion \"trend-setter\" and a \"style icon who constantly reinvents herself\". Pointing out the several reinventions in Minogue's image, Larissa Dubecki from The Age labelled her the \"Mother of Reinvention\".Minogue has been inspired by and compared to American artist Madonna throughout her career. She received negative comments her Rhythm of Love Tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour, for which critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe. Writing for the Observer Music Monthly, Rufus Wainwright described her as \"the anti-Madonna. Self-knowledge is a truly beautiful thing and Kylie knows herself inside out. She is what she is and there is no attempt to make quasi-intellectual statements to substantiate it. She is the gay shorthand for joy.\" Kathy McCabe for The Telegraph noted Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion, but concluded, \"Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet ... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force.\" She has said of Madonna, \"Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn't immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like me, she had done everything there was to be done\", and \"Madonna's the Queen of Pop, I'm the princess. I'm quite happy with that.\"\nIn January 2007, Madame Tussauds in London unveiled its fourth waxwork of Minogue. During the same week a bronze cast of her hands was added to Wembley Arena's \"Square of Fame\". In 2007, a bronze statue of Minogue was unveiled at Melbourne Docklands for permanent display.In March 2010, Minogue was declared by researchers as the \"most powerful celebrity in Britain\".

In 2016, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, Minogue had a net worth of \u00a355 million.In May 2020, Alison Boshoff of The New Zealand Herald labelled her as the \"great comeback queen of Pop, for springing back from any setback\" in her life and career. In November 2020, Nick Levine of BBC described her as \"pop's most underestimated icon\", adding \"she's [Minogue] lasted more than 30 years by delivering pop songs with passion and panache, and retaining a quintessentially likeable persona along the way, in such a cutthroat industry.\" In June 2023, Barbara Ellen of The Guardian commented \"modesty, likeability and vulnerability have aided Minogue enduring appeal\", 36 years after the 1987 single \"I Should Be So Lucky\" was released.Minogue is regarded as a gay icon, which she has encouraged with comments including \"I am not a traditional gay icon. There's been no tragedy in my life, only tragic outfits\" and \"My gay audience has been with me from the beginning ... they kind of adopted me.\" Her status as a gay icon has been attributed to her music, fashion sense and career longevity. Author Constantine Chatzipapatheodoridis wrote about Minogue's appeal to gay men in Strike a Pose, Forever: The Legacy of Vogue... and observed she \"frequently incorporates camp-inflected themes in her extravaganzas, drawing mainly from the disco scene, the S/M culture, and the burlesque stage.\" In Beautiful Things in Popular Culture (2007), Marc Brennan stated Minogue's work \"provides a gorgeous form of escapism\". Minogue has explained she first became aware of her gay audience in 1988, when several drag queens performed to her music at a Sydney pub, and she later saw a similar show in Melbourne. She said she felt \"very touched\" to have such an \"appreciative crowd\", and this encouraged her to perform at gay venues throughout the world, as well as headlining the 1994 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Minogue has one of the largest gay followings in the world.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39560", "text": "Minogue explained she first became interested in pop music during her adolescence: \"I first got into pop music in 1981, I'd say. It was all about Prince, Adam + the Ants, that whole New Romantic period. Prior to that, it was the Jackson 5, Donna Summer, and my dad's records \u2013 the Stones and Beatles.\" She would also listen to the records of Olivia Newton-John and ABBA. She said she \"wanted to be\" Newton-John while growing up. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue during the early years of her music career with the observation: \"She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna ... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her.\" Minogue came to prominence in the music scene as a bubblegum pop singer and was deemed a \"product of the Stock Aitken Waterman Hit Factory\". Australian musician Nick Cave, who worked with her, was a major influence on her artistic development. She told The Guardian: \"He's definitely infiltrated my life in beautiful and profound ways.\" Throughout her career, her work was also influenced by British singer-songwriter-producer Cathy Dennis, British record producer D Mob, British band Scritti Politti, Icelandic singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rk, British rapper Tricky, Irish rock band U2 and Japanese pop band Pizzicato Five, among others.\nMinogue has been known for her soft soprano vocal range. Tim Sendra of AllMusic reviewed her album Aphrodite and said Minogue's \"slightly nasal, girl next door vocals serve her needs perfectly.\" According to Fiona MacDonald from Madison magazine, Minogue \"has never shied away from making some brave but questionable artistic decisions\". In musical terms, Minogue has worked with many genres in pop and dance music. However, her signature music has been contemporary disco music. Her first studio albums with Stock, Aitken, and Waterman present a more bubblegum pop influence, with many critics comparing her to American singer-songwriter Madonna. Chris True from AllMusic, reviewed her debut album, Kylie and found her music \"standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum\", however he stated she presented the most personality of any 1980s recording artist. He said of her third album Rhythm of Love, from the early 1990s, \"The songwriting is stronger, the production dynamic, and Kylie seems more confident vocally.\" At the time of her third studio album, \"She began to trade in her cutesy, bubblegum pop image for a more mature one, and in turn, a more sexual one.\" Chris True stated during her relationship with Australian singer-actor Michael Hutchence, \"her shedding of the near-virginal fa\u00e7ade that dominated her first two albums, began to have an effect, not only on how the press and her fans treated her, but in the evolution of her music.\"Her self-titled fifth studio album, primarily a dance-pop album integrating elements of R&B and adult contemporary music saw a shift in her music. Chris True of AllMusic stated the album is a \"remarkable change from Minogue's previous teen pop material\" and the \"start of a second phase\" in her music career. From her work on her sixth studio album, Impossible Princess, her songwriting and musical content began to change. She was constantly writing down words, exploring the form and meaning of sentences. She had written lyrics before, but called them \"safe, just neatly rhymed words and that's that\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine said the album bears a resemblance to Madonna's Ray of Light (1998). He said she took inspiration from \"both the Britpop and electronica movements of the mid-'90s\", saying \"Impossible Princess is the work of an artist willing to take risks\".Her seventh studio album, Light Years is a disco-influenced dance-pop record, with AllMusic's Chris True calling it \"Arguably one of the best disco records since the '70s\". True stated her eighth studio album, Fever, \"combines the disco-diva comeback of Light Years with simple dance rhythms\". Her ninth studio album, Body Language, was quite different from her musical experiments in the past as it was a \"successful\" attempt at broadening her sound with electro and hip-hop for instance. Incorporating styles of dance music with funk, disco and R&B, the album was listed on Q's \"Best Albums of 2003\".Critics said Minogue's tenth studio album X did not feature enough \"consistency\" and Chris True called the tracks \"cold, calculated dance-pop numbers.\" Tim Sendra of AllMusic said her eleventh album, Aphrodite, \"rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems\" and \"the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop that really is her strong suit.\" Sendra found Aphrodite \"One of her best, in fact.\" Kiss Me Once, her twelfth studio album has been described by critics as her return to contemporary pop music.Her fourteenth studio album, Golden was heavily influenced by country music, although maintaining her dance-pop sensibilities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote \"Golden further bolsters Minogue's reputation for taking risks\u2014and artfully sets the stage for her inevitable disco comeback.\" For her fifteenth studio album, Disco, she began\nto audio engineer her own music due to the restrictions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39561", "text": "Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception she had not \"paid her dues\" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on the soap opera Neighbours. She acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\"In 1993, Australian director Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with American actress Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, she has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \"look\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected. Her progression from the wholesome \"girl next door\" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans. Her music video for \"Spinning Around\" led to some media outlets referring to her as \"SexKylie\", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos. In September 2002, she was ranked 27 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists list. She was also named one of the 100 Hottest Women of All-Time by Men's Health in 2013. William Baker described her status as a sex symbol as a \"double edged sword\", observing \"we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record. But now it has become in danger of eclipsing what she actually is: a pop singer.\" After 20 years as a performer, she was described by BBC's Fiona Pryor as a fashion \"trend-setter\" and a \"style icon who constantly reinvents herself\". Pointing out the several reinventions in Minogue's image, Larissa Dubecki from The Age labelled her the \"Mother of Reinvention\".Minogue has been inspired by and compared to American artist Madonna throughout her career. She received negative comments her Rhythm of Love Tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour, for which critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe. Writing for the Observer Music Monthly, Rufus Wainwright described her as \"the anti-Madonna. Self-knowledge is a truly beautiful thing and Kylie knows herself inside out. She is what she is and there is no attempt to make quasi-intellectual statements to substantiate it. She is the gay shorthand for joy.\" Kathy McCabe for The Telegraph noted Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion, but concluded, \"Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet ... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force.\" She has said of Madonna, \"Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn't immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like me, she had done everything there was to be done\", and \"Madonna's the Queen of Pop, I'm the princess. I'm quite happy with that.\"\nIn January 2007, Madame Tussauds in London unveiled its fourth waxwork of Minogue. During the same week a bronze cast of her hands was added to Wembley Arena's \"Square of Fame\". In 2007, a bronze statue of Minogue was unveiled at Melbourne Docklands for permanent display.In March 2010, Minogue was declared by researchers as the \"most powerful celebrity in Britain\".

It was later released on October 3, 2013 on iOS devices and Android. On December 2, 2013 it was also released on the Ouya. The game has been delisted from console storefronts as of April 2, 2018, making it a Steam exclusive until 2023.The game was created by Ron Gilbert, building on an idea that he has had for nearly twenty years about a cave that lures people into it to explore their darker personality traits.  The game is rated \"teen\" for blood and violence.  The game borrows concepts from his earlier 1987 game, Maniac Mansion, such as the player initially selecting three different characters from a cast of seven to explore the Cave. Many of the game's puzzles require the three characters to work in coordination to complete, while some puzzles are specific to the unique abilities of a character; in this manner the Cave can only be fully explored through multiple play-throughs.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_39638", "text": "The Cave's story is based on a magical talking cave (voiced by Stephen Stanton) with a labyrinthine set of tunnels within it. Seven characters, drawn from across time and space and harboring dark secrets, have come to the Cave, believing they can \"learn something about themselves and who they might become\", as stated by Gilbert. In one example, a knight character goes to a princess for her amulet, which is the key to unlocking the pulling of the sword, who tells him to bring the treasure the dragon is guarding. The knight then succeeds, but forgets to close the gate to the dragon's den, in turn causing the dragon to eat the princess and coughing up the amulet. The knight then goes to the king with the amulet and is allowed to pull the sword, which was impossible at first due to the many rocks beneath it - however, our characters overcome it by blowing it with dynamite. He then pulls out the sword, and the king \"ran off to congratulate his favorite daughter\", but then gets eaten by the dragon as well. At the start of the game, the player selects three of the seven characters, which they are then locked to for the remainder of the game; players can restart a new game to select a different trio of characters. The characters are based on stereotypical figures, such as a hillbilly, a pair of twins (acting as one character), and a scientist.\n\nAs the player controls the trio to explore the Cave, they collect objects and interact with the environment in a manner similar to an adventure game. The exploration of the game is based on 2D platformer elements, though the game is presented with 3D graphics. Exploration is described as being \"Metroidvania\"-like, where more of the Cave's tunnels and chambers become accessible as players collect objects in a manner similar to Metroid or Castlevania. The player will need to work with all three characters, switching between them typically to activate multiple parts of a puzzle; one example shown in early press demonstrations was to use one character to ring a bell to distract a monster, a second character to repair a hot dog vending machine so to provide bait, and a third to operate a giant claw machine to pick up the monster to clear their path. Each character has a unique ability to aid in maneuvering the cave tunnels, leaving some areas inaccessible if the appropriate characters aren't chosen at the start; for example, the adventurer is able to swing herself across gaps with a rope, while the time traveler can phase shift a short distance, passing through closed gates. In addition, some areas of the Cave are accessible only to one of the specific characters; such as the knight finding a castle or the scientist discovering a laboratory; these areas represent the deep desires and dark aspects of a character that lured him or her to the Cave in the first place. While there are hazards that can kill a character, the character respawns shortly afterwards nearby, allowing the player to reattempt the move. Throughout the game will be iconographs for each of the three characters, which the player will need to get near to activate; these provide one of several still art images that reveal the character's back-story.\n\nThe game is primarily a single-player game, but up to three players can participate cooperatively on the same computer or console, each controlling one of the three selected characters.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39639", "text": "Ron Gilbert has been working with adventure games since his days at LucasArts, including several collaborations with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman; together, they developed games like Maniac Mansion, its sequel Day of the Tentacle, and the first games in the Monkey Island series. Gilbert left LucasArts in 1992, initially creating his own development studio Humongous Entertainment, but then moving on to other games, including contributing to Telltale Games' episodic series, Tales of Monkey Island based on the LucasArts series. Meanwhile, Schafer would stay with LucasArts until the adventure game market fell in the late 1990s, and created his own studio, Double Fine Productions, with several of the former LucasArts developers. Though Double Fine struggled with well-received but financially unsuccessful titles Psychonauts and Br\u00fctal Legend, it became successful in marketing four smaller games developed during an \"Amnesia Fortnight\" period in Br\u00fctal Legend's development between 2010 and 2011.Gilbert has stated that the idea of The Cave has been one he has had for a long time; he said, of his idea, \"People have really dark secrets, and going into a cave which is really dark and deep\u2026 that metaphor really resonated with me\". While still at LucasArts, Gilbert had drawn out parts of a labyrinthine cave complex on paper, but the idea never expanded beyond that at that point. Prior to Gilbert's employment at Double Fine, he and Schafer continued to discuss game development and ideas; Gilbert had mentioned this cave idea, prompting Schafer to suggest him coming to work at his company to develop the idea. By September 2010, Gilbert was officially part of Double Fine to work on The Cave; at the time, Gilbert had stated that the yet-named title was \"an entirely new concept\" and that \"fans of those old adventure games will like it\". The timing of larger development of The Cave coincided with the resurgence in adventure games such as those produced by Telltale Games, and the success of the Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter. Gilbert also considered that with casual games becoming more mainstream and acceptable, the market can handle niche games such as adventure games which do not require fast reflexes. Despite the market potential, Gilbert found that pitching the game to publishers was still a challenge, as they did not perceive that a market would exist for such games. Through the act of pitching the game to publishers for the first time in his career, Gilbert had to move away from the free-form design he had used on previous titles and set out plans for the game as a whole, which he found as a benefit; the need to present information to potential publishers required him to think about the game as a whole while still allowing smaller elements to be added in at a later date as they saw fit.The Cave's gameplay development was based on three defining factors in Gilbert's mind: having the player select three of a number of characters to explore the cave, to offer a \"light\" platforming element to offer other challenges outside of puzzles, and to avoid the use of an inventory system. Gilbert's earlier Maniac Mansion influenced him to revisit the concept of having several playable characters that the player can switch between. Gilbert noted that within Maniac Mansion, several of the characters have minimal use within the game, and sought to correct that within The Cave by giving equal weight to each of the seven playable characters. Gilbert recognized that with seven characters the player would need to play the game three times to see all the character-specific content in the game, but felt this was still a good number to use. He recognized that from Maniac Mansion, players would tend to gravitate towards or away from certain characters, and may always want to play with one specific character in the game. Gilbert maintained the same count in The Cave for this reason. While other aspects of Maniac Mansion may have influenced other design decisions within The Cave, Gilbert considered these less likely to have been conscious decisions on his part. The structure of the Cave within the game was designed to give each character a large unique area to explore, as to avoid the scenario where \"you play it again and 95 percent is the same\".While the game is part platformer, Gilbert's intent was not to make it a challenge to traverse the Cave noting that it is nearly impossible to die by missing a jump. Instead, the platforming elements were added as to add variety to moving about the Cave, recalling that in the development of the Monkey Island games, players would become bored walking the same area over and over again. Gilbert's aim for the game's puzzles was to keep them less demanding to allow the game's story and visuals to be the main focus of the player's attention, comparing this to similar methods used in the game Limbo. Gilbert did not want to penalize players for cheap or permanent character deaths, feeling that the death-and-respawn approach would be taken as \"a minor set-back\".Similarly to reduce the game's complexity, he did not include a typical inventory system as with most adventure games; each character can carry a single object, which is shown being carried on screen, aiding as visual aids for puzzle solving instead of having to sort through multiple inventory screens.  Gilbert wanted the game to be playable by several people, recounting his youth experience of playing the text-based Colossal Cave Adventure with several of his friends, working together to solve puzzles. Similarly, Gilbert took into account that his older games were designed for a different audience, where developers \"needed to provide 40 hours of gameplay, because that was the standard\" while players \"wanted to be bashing their heads against the screen for days on end\" to solve comparatively hard puzzles; instead, The Cave was designed to be \"more forgiving\" and \"more accommodating\" to the modern audiences.Gilbert compared the development of the world, characters, and puzzles similar to his past LucasArts adventure games. For example, Gilbert identified the mansion as the \"genesis\" for the rest of Maniac Mansion; in a similar manner, the team for The Cave first created the environs of the Cave, leading to the development of characters that would likely inhabit or visit the Cave, fleshing their individual roles out into a larger story and eventually into designing key puzzle elements for the game. Gilbert had started with more ideas for playable characters, up to 20 or 30 based on common stereotypes including an opera singer and a CIA agent, but discarded these when he could not flesh out their reasons for wanting to go to the Cave, and keeping others that he considered his favorites. Gilbert also sought to provide an equal number of characters of each gender, using the twins \u2013 a boy and girl \u2013 to satisfy this requirement.The Cave is a sentient character in the game, following on Gilbert's idea that the Cave has witnessed all of human evolution over time and mankind's fascination with caves, and thus would be an interesting character within the story. This made it a challenge in writing the story, as the Cave acts as a narrator alongside other voiced non-player characters, but the main playable ones will remain silent. This also allowed Gilbert to keep a sense of mystery about the playable characters; if they were voiced, the dialog would have likely explicitly spelled out their reasons for being in the Cave, while their ultimate goals remain shrouded if they were silent.

The departure was on completely amiable terms with the company, according to Gilbert. Gilbert further clarified that his employment at Double Fine had always been  specifically to develop The Cave with no firm plans beyond that; further collaborative efforts with Double Fine remain a possibility in the future. He stated that he considers himself a \"nomad\" in game development, preferring smaller teams, and was already working with a former collaborator from Deathspank towards a new mobile game.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39638", "text": "The Cave's story is based on a magical talking cave (voiced by Stephen Stanton) with a labyrinthine set of tunnels within it. Seven characters, drawn from across time and space and harboring dark secrets, have come to the Cave, believing they can \"learn something about themselves and who they might become\", as stated by Gilbert. In one example, a knight character goes to a princess for her amulet, which is the key to unlocking the pulling of the sword, who tells him to bring the treasure the dragon is guarding. The knight then succeeds, but forgets to close the gate to the dragon's den, in turn causing the dragon to eat the princess and coughing up the amulet. The knight then goes to the king with the amulet and is allowed to pull the sword, which was impossible at first due to the many rocks beneath it - however, our characters overcome it by blowing it with dynamite. He then pulls out the sword, and the king \"ran off to congratulate his favorite daughter\", but then gets eaten by the dragon as well. At the start of the game, the player selects three of the seven characters, which they are then locked to for the remainder of the game; players can restart a new game to select a different trio of characters. The characters are based on stereotypical figures, such as a hillbilly, a pair of twins (acting as one character), and a scientist.\n\nAs the player controls the trio to explore the Cave, they collect objects and interact with the environment in a manner similar to an adventure game. The exploration of the game is based on 2D platformer elements, though the game is presented with 3D graphics. Exploration is described as being \"Metroidvania\"-like, where more of the Cave's tunnels and chambers become accessible as players collect objects in a manner similar to Metroid or Castlevania. The player will need to work with all three characters, switching between them typically to activate multiple parts of a puzzle; one example shown in early press demonstrations was to use one character to ring a bell to distract a monster, a second character to repair a hot dog vending machine so to provide bait, and a third to operate a giant claw machine to pick up the monster to clear their path. Each character has a unique ability to aid in maneuvering the cave tunnels, leaving some areas inaccessible if the appropriate characters aren't chosen at the start; for example, the adventurer is able to swing herself across gaps with a rope, while the time traveler can phase shift a short distance, passing through closed gates. In addition, some areas of the Cave are accessible only to one of the specific characters; such as the knight finding a castle or the scientist discovering a laboratory; these areas represent the deep desires and dark aspects of a character that lured him or her to the Cave in the first place. While there are hazards that can kill a character, the character respawns shortly afterwards nearby, allowing the player to reattempt the move. Throughout the game will be iconographs for each of the three characters, which the player will need to get near to activate; these provide one of several still art images that reveal the character's back-story.\n\nThe game is primarily a single-player game, but up to three players can participate cooperatively on the same computer or console, each controlling one of the three selected characters.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39639", "text": "Ron Gilbert has been working with adventure games since his days at LucasArts, including several collaborations with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman; together, they developed games like Maniac Mansion, its sequel Day of the Tentacle, and the first games in the Monkey Island series. Gilbert left LucasArts in 1992, initially creating his own development studio Humongous Entertainment, but then moving on to other games, including contributing to Telltale Games' episodic series, Tales of Monkey Island based on the LucasArts series. Meanwhile, Schafer would stay with LucasArts until the adventure game market fell in the late 1990s, and created his own studio, Double Fine Productions, with several of the former LucasArts developers. Though Double Fine struggled with well-received but financially unsuccessful titles Psychonauts and Br\u00fctal Legend, it became successful in marketing four smaller games developed during an \"Amnesia Fortnight\" period in Br\u00fctal Legend's development between 2010 and 2011.Gilbert has stated that the idea of The Cave has been one he has had for a long time; he said, of his idea, \"People have really dark secrets, and going into a cave which is really dark and deep\u2026 that metaphor really resonated with me\". While still at LucasArts, Gilbert had drawn out parts of a labyrinthine cave complex on paper, but the idea never expanded beyond that at that point. Prior to Gilbert's employment at Double Fine, he and Schafer continued to discuss game development and ideas; Gilbert had mentioned this cave idea, prompting Schafer to suggest him coming to work at his company to develop the idea. By September 2010, Gilbert was officially part of Double Fine to work on The Cave; at the time, Gilbert had stated that the yet-named title was \"an entirely new concept\" and that \"fans of those old adventure games will like it\". The timing of larger development of The Cave coincided with the resurgence in adventure games such as those produced by Telltale Games, and the success of the Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter. Gilbert also considered that with casual games becoming more mainstream and acceptable, the market can handle niche games such as adventure games which do not require fast reflexes. Despite the market potential, Gilbert found that pitching the game to publishers was still a challenge, as they did not perceive that a market would exist for such games. Through the act of pitching the game to publishers for the first time in his career, Gilbert had to move away from the free-form design he had used on previous titles and set out plans for the game as a whole, which he found as a benefit; the need to present information to potential publishers required him to think about the game as a whole while still allowing smaller elements to be added in at a later date as they saw fit.The Cave's gameplay development was based on three defining factors in Gilbert's mind: having the player select three of a number of characters to explore the cave, to offer a \"light\" platforming element to offer other challenges outside of puzzles, and to avoid the use of an inventory system. Gilbert's earlier Maniac Mansion influenced him to revisit the concept of having several playable characters that the player can switch between. Gilbert noted that within Maniac Mansion, several of the characters have minimal use within the game, and sought to correct that within The Cave by giving equal weight to each of the seven playable characters. Gilbert recognized that with seven characters the player would need to play the game three times to see all the character-specific content in the game, but felt this was still a good number to use. He recognized that from Maniac Mansion, players would tend to gravitate towards or away from certain characters, and may always want to play with one specific character in the game. Gilbert maintained the same count in The Cave for this reason. While other aspects of Maniac Mansion may have influenced other design decisions within The Cave, Gilbert considered these less likely to have been conscious decisions on his part. The structure of the Cave within the game was designed to give each character a large unique area to explore, as to avoid the scenario where \"you play it again and 95 percent is the same\".While the game is part platformer, Gilbert's intent was not to make it a challenge to traverse the Cave noting that it is nearly impossible to die by missing a jump. Instead, the platforming elements were added as to add variety to moving about the Cave, recalling that in the development of the Monkey Island games, players would become bored walking the same area over and over again. Gilbert's aim for the game's puzzles was to keep them less demanding to allow the game's story and visuals to be the main focus of the player's attention, comparing this to similar methods used in the game Limbo. Gilbert did not want to penalize players for cheap or permanent character deaths, feeling that the death-and-respawn approach would be taken as \"a minor set-back\".Similarly to reduce the game's complexity, he did not include a typical inventory system as with most adventure games; each character can carry a single object, which is shown being carried on screen, aiding as visual aids for puzzle solving instead of having to sort through multiple inventory screens.  Gilbert wanted the game to be playable by several people, recounting his youth experience of playing the text-based Colossal Cave Adventure with several of his friends, working together to solve puzzles. Similarly, Gilbert took into account that his older games were designed for a different audience, where developers \"needed to provide 40 hours of gameplay, because that was the standard\" while players \"wanted to be bashing their heads against the screen for days on end\" to solve comparatively hard puzzles; instead, The Cave was designed to be \"more forgiving\" and \"more accommodating\" to the modern audiences.Gilbert compared the development of the world, characters, and puzzles similar to his past LucasArts adventure games. For example, Gilbert identified the mansion as the \"genesis\" for the rest of Maniac Mansion; in a similar manner, the team for The Cave first created the environs of the Cave, leading to the development of characters that would likely inhabit or visit the Cave, fleshing their individual roles out into a larger story and eventually into designing key puzzle elements for the game. Gilbert had started with more ideas for playable characters, up to 20 or 30 based on common stereotypes including an opera singer and a CIA agent, but discarded these when he could not flesh out their reasons for wanting to go to the Cave, and keeping others that he considered his favorites. Gilbert also sought to provide an equal number of characters of each gender, using the twins \u2013 a boy and girl \u2013 to satisfy this requirement.The Cave is a sentient character in the game, following on Gilbert's idea that the Cave has witnessed all of human evolution over time and mankind's fascination with caves, and thus would be an interesting character within the story. This made it a challenge in writing the story, as the Cave acts as a narrator alongside other voiced non-player characters, but the main playable ones will remain silent. This also allowed Gilbert to keep a sense of mystery about the playable characters; if they were voiced, the dialog would have likely explicitly spelled out their reasons for being in the Cave, while their ultimate goals remain shrouded if they were silent. A cartoon-ish art style, with the characters having larger-than-normal heads and more exaggerated movements, was chosen to allow the characters to still express themselves in a manner that can easily be seen by the player.Two months after the release of The Cave, Gilbert announced he was leaving Double Fine after setting out to complete the game he wanted, and was time to \"move on\" and \"plot my next move\".

It stars Harry Dean Stanton and Emilio Estevez, with Tracey Walter, Olivia Barash, Sy Richardson, Vonetta McGee, Fox Harris, and Dick Rude among the supporting cast. Set in Los Angeles, the plot concerns a young punk rocker (Estevez) who is recruited by a car repossession agency and gets caught up in the pursuit of a mysterious Chevrolet Malibu that might be connected to extraterrestrials.\nA satire of America under the Reagan administration, consumerism and the Atomic Age, Repo Man was developed by Cox in partnership with his fellow film school graduates from UCLA, independent producers Jonathan Wacks and Peter McCarthy. His inspiration for the film came from his own experiences working with repossession agent Mark Lewis. Originally conceiving of it as a road movie, Cox reconfigured the story to take place mostly in Los Angeles to maintain its budget. Michael Nesmith of The Monkees came on board the project as an executive producer, and secured a negative pickup deal with Universal Pictures. Principal photography ran through summer 1983, during which Cox encouraged improvisation from the cast; the film's ending notably differed from what had originally been written. The soundtrack, headlined by a main theme composed and performed by Iggy Pop, is noted as a snapshot of 1980s hardcore punk; Cox wanted the music to underscore the life of repo men.Despite a troubled initial release due to Universal's skepticism towards the film's commercial viability, Repo Man received widespread acclaim, and was deemed by critics to be one of the best films of 1984. It has since gained a cult following, particularly surrounding Cox's re-edited version of the film for television due to its deliberate inclusion of surreal overdubs to replace profanity. A stand-alone sequel based on an unproduced screenplay by Cox, Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday, was published as a graphic novel in 2008, while a spiritual successor, Repo Chick, was released in 2009.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_39658", "text": "In the Mojave Desert, a policeman pulls over a 1964 Chevrolet Malibu driven by J.

During much of this time, he was known as \"Erique\" Redd, as there was already another Eric Redd in the European entertainers' union.\nHe next appeared in another Andrew Lloyd Webber production, the London production of Starlight Express. It was there, in 1991, that Redd turned increasingly to singing, landing a contract on Jive Records UK and releasing a club-friendly cover of Paul Simon's \"50 Ways to Leave a Lover.\" After two years with Jive Records, Redd, who realized the label was concentrating only on rap, decided to head back to California, where he wrote and recorded music for television, served as a music supervisor for Black Entertainment Television (BET)'s new programming department. He also performed, toured and recorded with artists such as k.d. lang, Sara Lee (then of the B-52's) and Ani DiFranco.\nIn 2008, he completed his first full-length album, Across the Water, for German label White Noise.

During that same time he was featured with his penned track \"Go On\" on the newly released C.T.A. full-length CD, titled Sacred Ground.

It is the third and final main entry in the Dead Space series. The game's story follows player-character Isaac Clarke and his allies as they explore a frozen planet, Tau Volantis, to discover the origins of the growing threat from their enemies, the Necromorphs. Players control Isaac and explore the environment, solve puzzles, and find resources, while fighting Necromorphs and hostile humans called Unitologists. The game supports online cooperative multiplayer sessions in which a second player takes the role of new character John Carver.\nProduction of the game began in 2011 after the release of Dead Space 2; the sequel was initially planned as a horror-focused experience but  demands from Electronic Arts resulted in the introduction of action elements, the de-emphasis of horror themes, and the introduction of microtransactions. The gameplay was adjusted based on the new setting, and the story was written to close out the series and explain the remaining mysteries of the Necromorphs. Composers Jason Graves and James Hannigan wrote the game's score. A downloadable content (DLC) episode subtitled Awakened was released in March 2013; it was developed with more focus on horror elements.\nDead Space 3 was promoted with additional media, including a graphic novel called Dead Space: Liberation.

He recorded over 200 songs and sold over 30 million records in his career. In 1986, he was awarded the first-ever Grammy in the Best Polka Recording category. He rarely strayed from Slovenian-style polka, but did record with country guitarist Chet Atkins and pop singer Don Everly. He also recorded a version of the \"Too Fat Polka\" with comedian Drew Carey.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39858", "text": "Yankovic's father, a blacksmith, and his mother, a cook, met in a lumber camp in West Virginia where they both worked. When Yankovic was young, his father moved to Cleveland to escape authorities who learned of his bootlegging, and the rest of the family followed shortly thereafter. While living in Cleveland, he became enthralled by the brass bands that played at Slovenian social functions. His mother took on boarders to help with the family finances, including a man named Max Zelodec who performed Slovenian tunes on a button box. Yankovic acquired an accordion at age 9, and received a few lessons from Zelodec. By the late 1920s, in his early teenage years, he was a working musician, playing for community events. In the 1930s, he formed a business relationship with Joe Trolli and began making radio appearances on stations such as WJAY and WGAR. As his reputation spread, he sought opportunities to make records, but the major labels turned him down. His first records were made for the Yankee and Joliet labels operated by Fred Wolf, and the expenses were paid for by Yankovic himself.In 1940, he married his first wife June, and they began to raise a family. However, the expenses of family life quickly overcame the incoming money from his music career, so he opened a tavern, calling it the Yankovic Bar. It became a popular hangout for local musicians, and he continued to run it until he sold it in 1948, dedicating himself to the accordion.Yankovic enlisted in the armed forces in 1943 and cut numerous records while on leave, prior to his departure for Europe. Yankovic was assigned duty in 1943 in the infantry as a flame-thrower operator. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge where a severe case of frostbite nearly required the amputation of his hands and feet. Fortunately, he was able to beat the resulting gangrene before that became necessary, and was awarded a Purple Heart. The doctors urged him to have his fingers amputated, but he refused, as that would have ended his music career. After getting out of the hospital, he and four other musicians were assigned to special services to entertain the troops, including General George Patton and his Third United States Army.Yankovic hit the national scene when he earned two platinum singles for \"Just Because\" (1947) and \"Blue Skirt Waltz\" (1949). Others who recorded the Blue Skirt Waltz were the Tunemixers and Guy Lombardo both in 1949, Lawrence Welk (Myron Floren) in 1958, Jim Ed Brown and the Browns in 1960, Hank Thompson in 1962, and Bobby Vinton in 1976. Yankovic found a Bohemian Waltz called \"Cervenou Sukynku,\" (written by Vaclav Blaha) or loosely translated, \"Red Skirt Waltz.\" Yankovic asked Mitchell Parrish (\"Stardust\", \"Sleighride\") to write new lyrics to the melody. Parrish changed \"red\" to \"blue\". Yankovic sold over 2.5 million records and with the Tunemixers version and Guy Lombardo's version, it sold over 4 million records total in 1949. It was the second Cleveland-style song to sell over one million recordings.\nColumbia Records initially refused to record \"Just Because\", because other versions of the song had been around for years without much success; only allowing it when Yankovic said that he would buy the first 10,000 records. Yankovic obtained the title of America's Polka King after beating Louis Bashell, Romy Gosz, Harold Loeffelmacher and the Six Fat Dutchmen, Whoopee John Wilfahrt, and Lawrence Duchow in a battle of the bands in Milwaukee at the Milwaukee Arena on June 9, 1948.In 1950, he made his Hollywood debut and collaborated with Doris Day as a singer.In 1970, a house fire destroyed the gold records for \"Just Because\" and \"Blue Skirt Waltz\".Yankovic also hosted the television series Polka Time for Buffalo, New York-based WKBW-TV for 26 weeks in 1962. He commuted from Cleveland to host each episode, which aired live. He also hosted a similar show at WGN-TV Chicago at about the same time.\nHe won a Grammy Award in 1986 for his album 70 Years of Hits. He was the first winner in the Polka category. The NARAS (Grammy) organization dropped the category in 2008.He performed with musical comedian and fellow accordionist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, although the two are not related. Al, who also performs polka music among many other styles, has jokingly hypothesized that he was given accordion lessons as a child because his parents thought that \"there should be at least one more accordion-playing Yankovic in the world.\" Al performed accordion on \"Who Stole the Kishka?\" on one of Frankie's final records, Songs of the Polka King, Vol. 1.

He recorded over 200 songs and sold over 30 million records in his career. In 1986, he was awarded the first-ever Grammy in the Best Polka Recording category. He rarely strayed from Slovenian-style polka, but did record with country guitarist Chet Atkins and pop singer Don Everly. He also recorded a version of the \"Too Fat Polka\" with comedian Drew Carey.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39858", "text": "Yankovic's father, a blacksmith, and his mother, a cook, met in a lumber camp in West Virginia where they both worked. When Yankovic was young, his father moved to Cleveland to escape authorities who learned of his bootlegging, and the rest of the family followed shortly thereafter. While living in Cleveland, he became enthralled by the brass bands that played at Slovenian social functions. His mother took on boarders to help with the family finances, including a man named Max Zelodec who performed Slovenian tunes on a button box. Yankovic acquired an accordion at age 9, and received a few lessons from Zelodec. By the late 1920s, in his early teenage years, he was a working musician, playing for community events. In the 1930s, he formed a business relationship with Joe Trolli and began making radio appearances on stations such as WJAY and WGAR. As his reputation spread, he sought opportunities to make records, but the major labels turned him down. His first records were made for the Yankee and Joliet labels operated by Fred Wolf, and the expenses were paid for by Yankovic himself.In 1940, he married his first wife June, and they began to raise a family. However, the expenses of family life quickly overcame the incoming money from his music career, so he opened a tavern, calling it the Yankovic Bar. It became a popular hangout for local musicians, and he continued to run it until he sold it in 1948, dedicating himself to the accordion.Yankovic enlisted in the armed forces in 1943 and cut numerous records while on leave, prior to his departure for Europe. Yankovic was assigned duty in 1943 in the infantry as a flame-thrower operator. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge where a severe case of frostbite nearly required the amputation of his hands and feet. Fortunately, he was able to beat the resulting gangrene before that became necessary, and was awarded a Purple Heart. The doctors urged him to have his fingers amputated, but he refused, as that would have ended his music career. After getting out of the hospital, he and four other musicians were assigned to special services to entertain the troops, including General George Patton and his Third United States Army.Yankovic hit the national scene when he earned two platinum singles for \"Just Because\" (1947) and \"Blue Skirt Waltz\" (1949). Others who recorded the Blue Skirt Waltz were the Tunemixers and Guy Lombardo both in 1949, Lawrence Welk (Myron Floren) in 1958, Jim Ed Brown and the Browns in 1960, Hank Thompson in 1962, and Bobby Vinton in 1976. Yankovic found a Bohemian Waltz called \"Cervenou Sukynku,\" (written by Vaclav Blaha) or loosely translated, \"Red Skirt Waltz.\" Yankovic asked Mitchell Parrish (\"Stardust\", \"Sleighride\") to write new lyrics to the melody. Parrish changed \"red\" to \"blue\". Yankovic sold over 2.5 million records and with the Tunemixers version and Guy Lombardo's version, it sold over 4 million records total in 1949. It was the second Cleveland-style song to sell over one million recordings.\nColumbia Records initially refused to record \"Just Because\", because other versions of the song had been around for years without much success; only allowing it when Yankovic said that he would buy the first 10,000 records. Yankovic obtained the title of America's Polka King after beating Louis Bashell, Romy Gosz, Harold Loeffelmacher and the Six Fat Dutchmen, Whoopee John Wilfahrt, and Lawrence Duchow in a battle of the bands in Milwaukee at the Milwaukee Arena on June 9, 1948.In 1950, he made his Hollywood debut and collaborated with Doris Day as a singer.In 1970, a house fire destroyed the gold records for \"Just Because\" and \"Blue Skirt Waltz\".Yankovic also hosted the television series Polka Time for Buffalo, New York-based WKBW-TV for 26 weeks in 1962. He commuted from Cleveland to host each episode, which aired live. He also hosted a similar show at WGN-TV Chicago at about the same time.\nHe won a Grammy Award in 1986 for his album 70 Years of Hits. He was the first winner in the Polka category. The NARAS (Grammy) organization dropped the category in 2008.He performed with musical comedian and fellow accordionist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, although the two are not related. Al, who also performs polka music among many other styles, has jokingly hypothesized that he was given accordion lessons as a child because his parents thought that \"there should be at least one more accordion-playing Yankovic in the world.\" Al performed accordion on \"Who Stole the Kishka?\" on one of Frankie's final records, Songs of the Polka King, Vol. 1.

While touring in support of De-Loused, the band would incorporate more and more extended improvisational sections into some of their songs, often trying out new ideas. Parts of \"Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus\" (\"Facilis Descenus Averni\" and \"Con Safo\") were first performed live in the middle of \"Drunkship of Lanterns\" (as heard on Live EP) and \"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt\" respectively, while parts of \"Cassandra Gemini\" originated from improvisations during \"Cicatriz ESP\" (as heard on Scabdates). The album was initially to be titled Sarcophagus.Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez arranged and produced the recording sessions himself. Unlike De-Loused in the Comatorium, which was recorded in producer Rick Rubin's mansion, the new album was mostly recorded in what Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez described as \"a shithole\u2026 Basically a warehouse with one little air conditioner on its last legs, awful wiring and a console you couldn\u2019t rely on\". Rather than bring his ideas to the band as a whole and working them out at group rehearsals, he met individually with each player to practice each part one-on-one. \"We'll sit there and play it forever and slow\u2014real slow\u2014to understand what's happening. It's easy to play something fast and loud, but to play it soft and slow takes a certain amount of discipline. Then once we understand the part, everyone's free to elaborate\u2014their personalities come out and it's not my part anymore; they get into and give it that swing that I can't give it.\"\nRodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez took the additional step of recording the band member separately before layering the various tracks to create each song. Drummer Jon Theodore was the first to record his parts, and he spent time arranging and mapping out the songs with Omar and in the process figuring out what the rhythmic structures would be stated on the recording process. \"This is the first time I've ever been so methodical about recording. Normally I would go into the situation with as good an idea as I could, whether that was from performing the songs on tour or having a general road map. But this was the first instance where I considered every single hit all the way through, every figure up to and including every change. There were no question marks. So when I was tracking with the metronome it was just a question of right or wrong.\" An exception of such recording method was the middle section of \"Cassandra Gemini\", edited from a lengthy jam session.\nTracking this way had a mixed reception in the band; Theodore and bassist Juan Alderete responded well to the individualistic approach while keyboard player Isaiah \"Ikey\" Owens didn't like it at all. However, as Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez stated, \"People filling in ideas can become tedious and counterproductive. You find yourself working backwards. When you're in the studio 'what ifs' are your biggest enemy, so my general rule is, if it's something you can't live with\u2014if a sentence begins with 'I can't' or 'I will not'\u2014then we examine it. But if it's 'maybe we should' or 'I think that' then it's like, hey man, full steam ahead. Not that there isn't a lot of refinement to what we do\u2014obviously there is\u2014 but I consider it a balance of raw energy and refinement.\"Frances the Mute featured the largest array of guest musicians on any Mars Volta album to date. Flea, who played bass on De-Loused in the Comatorium, this time contributed trumpet to \"The Widow\" and \"Miranda...\". \"L'Via L'Viaquez\" featured guitar solos from John Frusciante as well as piano solos by Omar's childhood hero, salsa pianist Larry Harlow. Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez described the session with Harlow in Puerto Rico as \"a childhood dream come true\". \"Cassandra Gemini\" featured flute and saxophone contributions from Mexican woodwind player Adri\u00e1n Terrazas-Gonz\u00e1lez, who would join the band full time for the subsequent tour. All the tracks also included full string and horn sections, arranged by David Campbell with the help of Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez. According to Cedric Bixler-Zavala, while recording a section in \"Cassandra Gemini\" one of the orchestra members played so hard that he broke his antique bow: \"And you could see his \u2018classical\u2019 side come out \u2013 like, \u2018I broke this playing a fuckin\u2019 rock song??\u2019 He was pissed off.

Parts of \"Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus\" (\"Facilis Descenus Averni\" and \"Con Safo\") were first performed live in the middle of \"Drunkship of Lanterns\" (as heard on Live EP) and \"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt\" respectively, while parts of \"Cassandra Gemini\" originated from improvisations during \"Cicatriz ESP\" (as heard on Scabdates). The album was initially to be titled Sarcophagus.Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez arranged and produced the recording sessions himself. Unlike De-Loused in the Comatorium, which was recorded in producer Rick Rubin's mansion, the new album was mostly recorded in what Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez described as \"a shithole\u2026 Basically a warehouse with one little air conditioner on its last legs, awful wiring and a console you couldn\u2019t rely on\". Rather than bring his ideas to the band as a whole and working them out at group rehearsals, he met individually with each player to practice each part one-on-one. \"We'll sit there and play it forever and slow\u2014real slow\u2014to understand what's happening. It's easy to play something fast and loud, but to play it soft and slow takes a certain amount of discipline. Then once we understand the part, everyone's free to elaborate\u2014their personalities come out and it's not my part anymore; they get into and give it that swing that I can't give it.\"\nRodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez took the additional step of recording the band member separately before layering the various tracks to create each song. Drummer Jon Theodore was the first to record his parts, and he spent time arranging and mapping out the songs with Omar and in the process figuring out what the rhythmic structures would be stated on the recording process. \"This is the first time I've ever been so methodical about recording. Normally I would go into the situation with as good an idea as I could, whether that was from performing the songs on tour or having a general road map. But this was the first instance where I considered every single hit all the way through, every figure up to and including every change. There were no question marks. So when I was tracking with the metronome it was just a question of right or wrong.\" An exception of such recording method was the middle section of \"Cassandra Gemini\", edited from a lengthy jam session.\nTracking this way had a mixed reception in the band; Theodore and bassist Juan Alderete responded well to the individualistic approach while keyboard player Isaiah \"Ikey\" Owens didn't like it at all. However, as Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez stated, \"People filling in ideas can become tedious and counterproductive. You find yourself working backwards. When you're in the studio 'what ifs' are your biggest enemy, so my general rule is, if it's something you can't live with\u2014if a sentence begins with 'I can't' or 'I will not'\u2014then we examine it. But if it's 'maybe we should' or 'I think that' then it's like, hey man, full steam ahead. Not that there isn't a lot of refinement to what we do\u2014obviously there is\u2014 but I consider it a balance of raw energy and refinement.\"Frances the Mute featured the largest array of guest musicians on any Mars Volta album to date. Flea, who played bass on De-Loused in the Comatorium, this time contributed trumpet to \"The Widow\" and \"Miranda...\". \"L'Via L'Viaquez\" featured guitar solos from John Frusciante as well as piano solos by Omar's childhood hero, salsa pianist Larry Harlow. Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez described the session with Harlow in Puerto Rico as \"a childhood dream come true\". \"Cassandra Gemini\" featured flute and saxophone contributions from Mexican woodwind player Adri\u00e1n Terrazas-Gonz\u00e1lez, who would join the band full time for the subsequent tour. All the tracks also included full string and horn sections, arranged by David Campbell with the help of Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez. According to Cedric Bixler-Zavala, while recording a section in \"Cassandra Gemini\" one of the orchestra members played so hard that he broke his antique bow: \"And you could see his \u2018classical\u2019 side come out \u2013 like, \u2018I broke this playing a fuckin\u2019 rock song??\u2019 He was pissed off. But I was like, \u2018Fuck yeah, man, that\u2019s on the record! You\u2019ve got to realise things like that are cool.\u2019\u201dIn 2012, Juan Alderete noted that Frances the Mute is the studio album he is most proud of.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "136_208", "question": "What type of music does Seven play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_39924", "text": "Seven (often stylized as Se7en) is a 1995 American crime thriller film directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and John C. McGinley. Set in an unnamed, crime-ridden city, Seven's narrative follows disenchanted, nearly retired detective William Somerset (Freeman) and his newly transferred partner David Mills (Pitt) as they try to stop a serial killer from executing a series of murders based on the seven deadly sins.\nWalker, an aspiring writer, based Seven on his experiences of moving from a suburban setting to New York City during a period of rising crime and drug addiction in the late 1980s. His script was optioned by an Italian film company but, following financial difficulties, the rights were sold to New Line Cinema. Studio executives were opposed to the script's bleak conclusion, insisting on a more mainstream and optimistic outcome. Fincher, determined to re-establish himself after a career setback, was mistakenly sent Walker's original script and, convinced of its merit, committed to directing the project if the original ending remained intact. Principal photography took place in Los Angeles between December 1994 and March 1995, on a $33\u2013$34 million budget. \nSeven garnered middling test audience results and was not predicted to perform well due to its violent and mature content. However, it grossed $327.3 million worldwide, becoming a surprise success and the seventh highest-grossing film of the year. Contemporaneous reviews were generally positive, praising the performances of the central cast and the bleak but unforgettable ending. Seven revitalized Fincher's career and helped Pitt move from roles based on his appearance to more serious, dramatic roles.\nIn the years since its release, consensus on the movie has generally shifted to critical acclaim. It has been influential in filmmaking, inspiring many imitators of its aesthetic, style, soundtrack, and premise of detectives investigating serial killers with distinctive methods and motives. The film's title sequence, which depicts the killer preparing for his actions later in the film, is considered an important design innovation that sparked a renewed interest in title design, while the film's twist ending has been named as one of the most shocking and unforgettable in cinematic history.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_39925", "text": "In an unnamed city overcome with violent crime and corruption, disillusioned police detective William Somerset is one week from retirement.

After auditioning for Motown, they received a contract and made recordings which went unreleased, before recording a song they had written, \"Greetings (This Is Uncle Sam).\"  The song was worked up by Motown staffers Robert Bateman, Brian Holland, and Ronnie Dunbar, who received co-writing credits, and was issued on the Miracle label, a Motown subsidiary for which this was its only hit record.

Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, James began his musical career in his teenage years. He was in various bands before entering the U.S. Navy Reserve to avoid being drafted into the army. In 1964, James moved to Toronto, Canada, where he formed the rock band the Mynah Birds, who eventually signed a recording deal with Motown Records in 1966. James's career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and eventually convicted him of desertion related charges. He served several months in jail.  After being released, James moved to California, where he started a variety of rock and funk groups in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nAfter forming the locally popular Stone City Band in his hometown of Buffalo in 1977, James finally found success as a recording artist after signing with Motown's Gordy Records, releasing the album Come Get It! in 1978 which produced the hits \"You & I\" and \"Mary Jane\". In 1981, James released his most successful album, Street Songs, which included career-defining hits such as \"Give It to Me Baby\" and \"Super Freak\", the latter song becoming his biggest crossover single, mixing elements of funk, disco, rock, and new wave. James was also known for his soulful ballads such as \"Fire & Desire\" and \"Ebony Eyes\". He also had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists including Teena Marie, the Mary Jane Girls, the Temptations, Eddie Murphy, and Smokey Robinson.\nJames's mainstream success had peaked by the release of his album Glow in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show, The A-Team. His subsequent album releases failed to sell as well as their predecessors. Rapper MC Hammer sampled James's \"Super Freak\" for his 1990 hit, \"U Can't Touch This\" which won Best R&B Song at the 1991 Grammy Awards. James received his only Grammy for composing the song. By the early 1990s, James's career was hampered by his drug addiction and he was embroiled in legal issues. In 1993, he was convicted of two separate instances of kidnapping and assaulting two different women while under the influence of crack cocaine, resulting in a three-year sentence at Folsom State Prison. He was released on parole in 1996. His health problems halted his career again after he had a mild stroke during a concert in 1998, and he announced a semi-retirement.\nIn 2004, James's career returned to mainstream pop culture after he appeared in an episode of Chappelle's Show. The segment involved a Charlie Murphy True Hollywood Stories-style skit that satirized James's wild lifestyle in the 1980s.

The game was originally released in August 2008 for the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service. Ports were developed and released for Microsoft Windows in April 2009, Mac OS X in May 2009, PlayStation 3 in November 2009, and Linux in December 2010. Jonathan Blow designed the game as a personal critique of contemporary trends in video game development. He self-funded the three-year project, working with webcomic artist David Hellman to develop the artwork. An anniversary version is planned for release for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Mobile, Windows, Mac, and Linux with updated graphics and developer commentary.\nThe basic story elements in Braid unfold as the protagonist, Tim, attempts to rescue a princess from a monster. Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative, giving clues about Tim's contemplations and motivations. The game features traditionally defining aspects of the platform genre while also integrating various novel powers of time-manipulation. Using these abilities, the player progresses through the game by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces.\nA preliminary version of Braid (without the final artwork) won the \"Innovation in Game Design\" award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival, while the final version received additional accolades. The game received critical acclaim, praising the mechanics, puzzles, graphics and soundtrack, but criticized the game's price relative to its length of play, eventually becoming the highest rated title on Xbox Live, and considered as one of the greatest video games ever made. It is seen as a keystone title in the growth of indie game development, and Blow and its production were documented in the 2012 film, Indie Game: The Movie. The game had total revenue nearing $6 million, as of 2015, which Blow used to fund his next game, The Witness, a 3D puzzle game released in 2016.\nA 15th Anniversary Edition of Braid, featuring remastered visuals and audio along with director's commentary, is scheduled for release in April 2024.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40031", "text": "Braid is played by solving physical puzzles in a standard platform game environment. The player controls the protagonist Tim as he runs, jumps, and climbs across the game's levels.

A defining game element is the player's unlimited ability to reverse time and \"rewind\" actions, even after dying. The game is divided into six worlds, which are experienced sequentially and can be entered from different rooms of Tim's house; the player can return to any world previously visited to attempt to solve puzzles they missed.\nEach world has its own time-based game mechanic:\n2.

In Rio Grande Blood, I was all into it: this guy's evil. But by the end of Last Sucker, I was just like, this guy is in over his head. The oligarchy rules, and this guy plays with crayons and reads My Pet Goat. I mean, he's a blithering idiot. I protested him here in El Paso one time. I got within 10 feet of him. I can't believe the Secret Service let me get that close. And he was at a taco stand, like, 'I'll take one of them there enchiritos.' Well, there was no enchirito on the menu, and I don't even know what an enchirito is. But George W. was insistent, so they made him an enchirito, and I got to witness the whole thing and I started feeling sorry for him. What a dolt, man. This guy is so stupid, he can't be running the country. Cheney and the oligarchy is running the country. This guy just plays with Tonka trucks and orders enchiritos.

Along with its strong box-office success, Pal Joey earned four Academy Award nominations and one Golden Globe Award nomination.\nJo Ann Greer sang for Hayworth, as she had done in Affair in Trinidad (1952) and Miss Sadie Thompson (1953). Novak's singing voice was dubbed by Trudy Stevens. The choreography was managed by Hermes Pan. Nelson Riddle handled the musical arrangements for the Rodgers and Hart standards \"The Lady Is a Tramp\", \"I Didn't Know What Time It Was\", \"I Could Write a Book\", and \"There's a Small Hotel\". \nPal Joey is one of Sinatra's few post-From Here to Eternity films that did not give him top billing, which went to Hayworth. Sinatra was, by this time, a bigger star. When asked about the billing, Sinatra replied, \"Ladies first.\" He said as it was a Columbia Pictures film, Hayworth should have top billing because \"For years, she was Columbia Pictures\" and being billed \"between\" Hayworth and Novak was \"a sandwich I don't mind being stuck in the middle of.\" Hayworth had garnered top-billing status in Columbia Pictures' films starting in 1944's Cover Girl through the 1959 film They Came to Cordura with Gary Cooper.\nSinatra's earnings from the film paid for his new home in Palm Springs.

The museum was later built and Santa visits were held there.Sheryl Cormier, \"the first Cajun female accordion recording artist\", stated in 2002 that she was influenced by Abshire, Aldus Roger, and Lawrence Walker.

{"id": "136_304", "question": "What type of music does King Crimson play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_40222", "text": "King Crimson were  an English progressive rock band formed in 1968 in London. The band drew inspiration from a wide variety of music, incorporating elements of classical, jazz, folk, heavy metal, gamelan, blues, industrial, electronic, experimental music and new wave. They exerted a strong influence on the early 1970s progressive rock movement, including on contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis, and continue to inspire subsequent generations of artists across multiple genres. The band earned a large cult following.Founded by Robert Fripp, Michael Giles, Greg Lake, Ian McDonald and Peter Sinfield, the band initially focused on a dramatic sound layered with Mellotron, McDonald's saxophone and flute, and Lake's bass and powerful lead vocals. Their debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969), remains their most commercially successful and influential release, with a potent mixture of jazz, classical and experimental music. Following the sudden simultaneous departures of McDonald and Giles, with Lake also leaving very shortly afterwards, the next two albums In the Wake of Poseidon and Lizard (both 1970) were recorded during a period of instability in the band's line-up. A settled band of Fripp, Sinfield, Mel Collins, Boz Burrell and Ian Wallace recorded Islands in 1971, though in mid-1972, Fripp let go of this line-up and changed the group's instrumentation and approach, drawing from European free improvisation and developing ever more complex compositions. With Bill Bruford, John Wetton, David Cross and, briefly, Jamie Muir, they reached what some saw as a creative peak on Larks' Tongues in Aspic (1973), Starless and Bible Black (1974), and Red (1974). King Crimson disbanded at the end of 1974.\nAfter seven years of inactivity, King Crimson was reborn in 1981 with another change in musical direction. The new band comprised Fripp, Bruford and new members Adrian Belew and Tony Levin. They drew influence from African music, gamelan, post-punk and New York minimalism. This band lasted three years, resulting in the trio of albums Discipline (1981), Beat (1982) and Three of a Perfect Pair (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, they reformed in 1994, adding Pat Mastelotto and Trey Gunn for a sextet line-up Fripp called \"The Double Trio\". The double trio participated in another three-year cycle of activity that included the release of Thrak (1995), and multiple concert recordings. There was a hiatus between 1997 and 2000. Four members of the double trio reunited in 2000 as a more industrial-oriented King Crimson, called \"The Double Duo\", releasing The Construkction of Light (2000) and The Power to Believe (2003). After a five-year hiatus, the group expanded (in the person of new second drummer Gavin Harrison) for a 2008 tour celebrating the 40th anniversary of their 1968 formation.\nFollowing another hiatus (2009\u20132012), during which Fripp was thought to be retired, King Crimson came together again in 2013; this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline, and new second guitarist and singer Jakko Jakszyk.

However, for their own compositions, King Crimson (unlike the rock bands that had come before them) largely stripped away the blues-based foundations of rock music and replaced them with influences derived from classical composers. The first incarnation of King Crimson played the Mars section of Gustav Holst's suite The Planets live and later the band used Mars as a foundation for the song \"Devil's Triangle\". As a result of this influence, In the Court of the Crimson King is frequently viewed as the nominal starting point of the progressive rock movements.

It was co-written, co-produced, and directed by series creator Stephen Hillenburg (in his feature directorial debut) and features the series' regular voice cast consisting of Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Clancy Brown, Rodger Bumpass, Mr. Lawrence, Jill Talley, Carolyn Lawrence, and Mary Jo Catlett. Guest stars Alec Baldwin, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeffrey Tambor voice new characters, and David Hasselhoff appears in live-action as himself. In the film, Plankton enacts a plan to discredit his business nemesis Mr. Krabs, steal the Krabby Patty secret formula and take over the world by stealing King Neptune's crown and framing Mr. Krabs for the crime. SpongeBob and Patrick team up to retrieve the crown from Shell City to save Mr. Krabs from Neptune's wrath and their world from Plankton's rule.\nHillenburg accepted an offer for a film adaptation of SpongeBob SquarePants from Paramount Pictures in 2002, after having turned it down multiple times the previous year. He assembled a team from the show's writing staff, including himself, Derek Drymon, Tim Hill, Kent Osborne, Aaron Springer, and Paul Tibbitt, and they structured the film as a mythical hero's journey that would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. The film was originally intended to serve as the series finale, but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner, with Tibbitt taking his place.\nThe SpongeBob SquarePants Movie premiered in Los Angeles on November 14, 2004, and was released in the United States on November 19. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $141 million worldwide, becoming the seventh highest-grossing animated film of 2004. Two sequels have been released: The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water (2015) and The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run (2020), with a fourth film, The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants, set to be released on December 19, 2025.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40233", "text": "A band of pirates find a treasure chest containing tickets to The SpongeBob SqaurePants Movie and enthusiastically head to the theater.\nIn the underwater city of Bikini Bottom, Eugene Krabs opens a second location of his popular restaurant, the Krusty Krab, next door to the original.

The origins of O.T.O. can be traced back to the German-speaking occultists Carl Kellner, Theodor Reuss, Heinrich Klein, and Franz Hartmann. In its first incarnation, O.T.O. was intended to be modelled after and associated with European Freemasonry and as such in its early years only Freemasons could seek admittance.\nFounder and first head of the Order Carl Kellner wanted to create an Academia Masonica wherein various rites of high-degree Freemasonry could be conferred within German-speaking countries. During the course of his esoteric studies across the globe and from many traditions, Kellner believed that he had discovered a key which offered a clear explanation of all the complex symbolism of Freemasonry and of nature itself. Kellner intended that O.T.O. preserve and confer this key. Arguably of less interest to Kellner but of importance to co-founder Reuss (who led the Order after Kellner's death), O.T.O. was also intended to be a revival of Adam Weishaupt's Bavarian Order of Illuminati.After the death of Reuss, English writer and occultist Aleister Crowley assumed control of the Order. Crowley had been inducted into O.T.O. by Reuss in the early 1910s. While maintaining many core elements of Freemasonry and the intentions of both Kellner and Reuss (including both concepts of an Academia Masonica and a revival of the Illuminati), O.T.O. was drastically changed by Crowley. The guiding philosophy of O.T.O. from this point on became Crowley's self-created occult system, Thelema. With this change O.T.O. ceased its bestowal of Masonic degrees and membership requirements.After Crowley's death in 1947, four main branches of O.T.O. claimed exclusive descent from the original organization and primacy over the other ones.

Immersed since childhood in the theatrical environment and in the emerging world of radio, at fourteen he decided not to study further, a decision that earned him being thrown out of the house by his parents. He moved to El Centro area of Buenos Aires.\nLinking his fate to that of Carlos Gardel began in 1933 when he was presented as a performance artist speaker at the Nacional theater. In 1934, Nelson began broadcasting his Buenos Aires radio program \"Escuche esta Noche a Gardel\" (\"Listen tonight to Gardel\"), trying to keep alive the public's interest in Gardel, who was killed on June 24, 1935 in an accidental airplane crash in Medell\u00edn.  \nSoon after, on Radio Callao, opened in January of that year, the announcer Carlos Enrique Cecchetti began broadcasting a program fully devoted to Gardel. Nelson continued that program beginning in 1936, inaugurating the show \"El Bronce que Sonr\u00ede\" (\"The smiling bronze\"). This program moved in 1944 to Radio Mitre. Each daily program started with this saying: \"Through time and distance his name endures as the truest symbol of our arts. Carlos Gardel, the smiling bronze.\" Gardel's remains were returned from Colombia on 5 February 1936.

Cherubini initially chose \"Joe Vanotti\" as his stage name, but a promotional poster for a night club incorrectly billed him as \"Jovanotti\" and the name stuck. The spelling Jovanotti is anglicized; the letter J is rarely used in Italian. Jovanotti is commonly known to his fans by the diminutive form \"Jova\", and often refers to himself that way in promotional items and on his Web TV channel Jova.TV, which launched 2 October 2014.\nJovanotti gradually departed from his early mix of hip hop, rap and disco, taking in funk, world music and even classical arrangements and ska influences. As his musical influences changed, so did his lyrics too, which over time began to increasingly address philosophical, religious and political issues, which are more typical of the Italian cantautore tradition. His social and political commitment increased as well. Some of his earlier work is also closer to keyboard-heavy 1980s pop.\nMost of his songs are sung in Italian; he also released a Spanish-language greatest hits album. His live album includes a short version of the Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight\". Jovanotti appears on several international compilations, most notably  Red Hot + Rhapsody, a 1998 tribute to George Gershwin, on which he performed \"I Got Rhythm\".

A monogrammed and dated Extensive landscape with figures was at Sotheby's on 24 April 2008, lot 37. These monogrammed works are typically of a small size.  There is still some uncertainty about whether Achterschellinck painted larger format works.\n\nSome large non-marked works (such as the works in the Groeningemuseum, Bruges) have been attributed to the artist.  A scholar has reported seeing a photograph of a signed example in a private collection, but this has not resolved conclusively the issue of the attributions of such large-scale works. These large format works are very close to works by Lodewijk de Vadder and Jacques d'Arthois and may therefore now be in collections where they have been attributed to these other artists.There are a number of landscapes with a clear stylistic relationship that are attributed to the artist.  Characteristic features of his style are the broad brush stroke, especially in the depiction of roads, verges and trees.  Similarly, the subtle silvery gradation of light and shade on tree trunks, and especially birches, is a recurring characteristic in the style of landscapes attributed to Achtschellinck.Achtschellinck was a follower of Rubens' style of landscape painting and was also influenced by Jacques d'Arthois. He painted large wooded sceneries for churches and cloisters, which were then garnished by others with biblical characters and events.  Achtschellinck painted the landscapes in many of the works of the Antwerp painter Gaspar de Crayer (1582\u20131669).\n\nLucas Achtschellinck was among the leading Brussels landscape artists of his time. His presumed second teacher Lodewijk de Vadder (1605\u20131655) and Jacques d'Arthois (1603\u20131686) were other prominent Brussels landscape artists. Lucas Achtschellinck is seen as part of the group of landscape painters active in Brussels which also included Lodewijk de Vadder, Jacques d'Arthois, Philip van Dapels and Cornelis Huysmans who often depicted the woods and sand banks in the Sonian Forest near Brussels. They are for this reason referred to as the School of Painters of the Sonian Forest.Lucas Achtschellinck also produced cartoons for the Brussels tapestry workshops.

He was successfully and employed 8 pupils including Th\u00e9obald Michau between 1659 and 1686.He died in Brussels.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40318", "text": "No signed or documented works of Achtschellinck are known, although some monogrammed works are known such as a landscape in the Fondation Custodia and a few works sold at auction. A monogrammed and dated Extensive landscape with figures was at Sotheby's on 24 April 2008, lot 37. These monogrammed works are typically of a small size.  There is still some uncertainty about whether Achterschellinck painted larger format works.\n\nSome large non-marked works (such as the works in the Groeningemuseum, Bruges) have been attributed to the artist.  A scholar has reported seeing a photograph of a signed example in a private collection, but this has not resolved conclusively the issue of the attributions of such large-scale works. These large format works are very close to works by Lodewijk de Vadder and Jacques d'Arthois and may therefore now be in collections where they have been attributed to these other artists.There are a number of landscapes with a clear stylistic relationship that are attributed to the artist.  Characteristic features of his style are the broad brush stroke, especially in the depiction of roads, verges and trees.  Similarly, the subtle silvery gradation of light and shade on tree trunks, and especially birches, is a recurring characteristic in the style of landscapes attributed to Achtschellinck.Achtschellinck was a follower of Rubens' style of landscape painting and was also influenced by Jacques d'Arthois. He painted large wooded sceneries for churches and cloisters, which were then garnished by others with biblical characters and events.  Achtschellinck painted the landscapes in many of the works of the Antwerp painter Gaspar de Crayer (1582\u20131669).\n\nLucas Achtschellinck was among the leading Brussels landscape artists of his time. His presumed second teacher Lodewijk de Vadder (1605\u20131655) and Jacques d'Arthois (1603\u20131686) were other prominent Brussels landscape artists. Lucas Achtschellinck is seen as part of the group of landscape painters active in Brussels which also included Lodewijk de Vadder, Jacques d'Arthois, Philip van Dapels and Cornelis Huysmans who often depicted the woods and sand banks in the Sonian Forest near Brussels. They are for this reason referred to as the School of Painters of the Sonian Forest.Lucas Achtschellinck also produced cartoons for the Brussels tapestry workshops. Together with Pieter Bout, Victor Honor\u00e9 Janssens, Peter Ykens and Lodewijk van Schoor, he designed models for large tapestry series including six models each for the series Dido and Aeneas, Perseus and Andromeda and for Teniers tapestries.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "136_341", "question": "What type of music does New York Art Quartet play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_40354", "text": "The New York Art Quartet was a free jazz ensemble, originally made up of saxophonist John Tchicai, trombonist Roswell Rudd, drummer Milford Graves and bassist Lewis Worrell, that came into existence in 1964 in New York City. Worrell was later replaced by various other bassists, including Reggie Workman, Finn Von Eyben, Harold Dodson, Eddie G\u00f3mez, Steve Swallow, and Buell Neidlinger. All About Jazz reviewer Clifford Allen wrote that the group \"cut some of the most powerful music in the free jazz underground\".In November 1962, Tchicai moved from his home country of Denmark to New York City at the suggestion of Archie Shepp and Bill Dixon, whom he had met at the Helsinki Jazz Festival earlier that year. Upon arriving in New York, Tchicai began playing with Dixon's group, which included Shepp and Roswell Rudd among others, and also sat in with Don Cherry and various other musicians. By the summer of 1963, Tchicai, Shepp, and Cherry had formed the New York Contemporary Five with bassist Don Moore and drummer J. C. Moses, while Rudd, with Shepp, continued to play with Dixon. According to Rudd, the idea of forming a new quartet originated with Tchicai, and the two began playing in filmmaker Michael Snow's loft space with Moore and Moses. Moses soon left as a result of mutual dissatisfaction with his role, and Rudd and Tchicai were soon introduced to drummer Milford Graves by saxophonist Giuseppi Logan. Tchicai recalled: \"this was a very pleasant surprise and more than that, because Graves simply baffled both Rudd and I in that we, at that time, hadn't heard anybody of the younger musicians in New York that had the same sense of rhythmic cohesion in poly-rhythmics or the same sense of intensity and musicality.\" Graves \"wound up playing with them for half an hour, astonishing Rudd and Tchicai, who promptly invited him to join what became The New York Art Quartet\". Graves later stated that his invitation to join the group came \"at a time when the evolutive phases of my spiritual and creative potential were in need of being expressed without limitation\". However, Tchicai also recalled that \"bassist Don Moore became so frightened of this wizard of a percussionist that he decided that this couldn't be true or possible and, therefore, refused to play with us\", and the group brought in bassist Lewis Worrell in his place.In July 1964, Tchicai and Rudd briefly joined Albert Ayler's quartet, which consisted of Ayler, Cherry, Gary Peacock, and Sunny Murray, to record New York Eye and Ear Control, the soundtrack for a film by Michael Snow. That fall, the NYAQ, calling themselves \"The John Tchicai Quartet\", played their debut concert, participating in the \"October Revolution in Jazz\" organized by Bill Dixon. In November, the NYAQ recorded their first album as part of ESP Disk's original roster of jazz artists, and a month later they performed at the Dixon-organized festival \"Four Days in December\" as the \"Roswell Rudd - John Tchicai Quartet\", playing opposite Sun Ra at Judson Hall. The group's second album, Mohawk, was recorded in July 1965 with Reggie Workman on bass (Worrell left the group in December 1964), and was released on the Fontana label. In the fall of 1965, Tchicai lined up dates for the NYAQ in Copenhagen, Gothenburg (Sweden), Hilversum (Holland), and Amsterdam (where they opened for Ornette Coleman's group), with Finn Von Eyben playing bass and Louis Moholo playing drums as a result of scheduling issues with the original musicians. Recordings from this tour were issued on Roswell Rudd, released in 1971 without Rudd's consent, and in 2010 on the album Old Stuff. The group broke up in February 1966, with Tchicai returning to Denmark.On June 13, 1999, the NYAQ, with Workman on bass, reunited for a performance at the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, opening for Sonic Youth. Amiri Baraka, whose poem \"Black Dada Nihilismus\" was included on their debut album 35 years earlier, also appeared. The group recorded the album 35th Reunion  the following day. In 2000 they played the Paris Banlieues Blues Festival, followed by a performance at the Lisboa festival in 2001. In 2013, after Tchicai's death, Triple Point Records released a limited-edition five-LP box set, along with a 156-page coffee-table book and miscellaneous artifacts, entitled Call It Art.According to Tchicai, one of the most unique aspects of the NYAQ was \"the polyphonic part of the music that came into play; the whole collective style of playing that also existed in New Orleans Jazz and classical music. The polyphonic aspect of our music was something quite new compared to what other people were doing in contemporary jazz.\" David Toop described the group's signature sound as \"deliberately ragged, bleary themes tumbling out in spasms, notes tailing away as if lost to daydream, the music so open that total collapse seems perpetually imminent\". In his liner notes to Mohawk, Tchicai wrote: \"The important thing about our music is that it must be heard and listened to without preconceived ideas as to how jazz should sound \u2013 listen to it as MUSIC and let that be the only label!\"A documentary on the NYAQ, entitled The Breath Courses Through Us, was released in 2013 by director Alan Roth.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The probe lands on Earth, where the President of the United States attempts to make first contact with it by playing \"Axel F\" on a keyboard, but the probe goes on a destructive attack, heading straight for San Francisco, despite unsuccessful attempts by the U.S. Armed Forces to destroy it. Monger convinces the President to grant the monsters their freedom if they can stop the probe. In San Francisco, the robot detects the quantonium within Ginormica's body and targets her.

His compositions include songs, solo piano works, chamber music, choral pieces, operas, ballets, and orchestral concert music. Among the best-known are the piano suite Trois mouvements perp\u00e9tuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champ\u00eatre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the Organ Concerto (1938), the opera Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites (1957), and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir, and orchestra.\nAs the only son of a prosperous manufacturer, Poulenc was expected to follow his father into the family firm, and he was not allowed to enrol at a music college. He studied with the pianist Ricardo Vi\u00f1es, who became his mentor after the composer's parents died. Poulenc also made the acquaintance of Erik Satie, under whose tutelage he became one of a group of young composers known collectively as Les Six. In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence. During the 1930s a much more serious side to his nature emerged, particularly in the religious music he composed from 1936 onwards, which he alternated with his more light-hearted works.\nIn addition to his work as a composer, Poulenc was an accomplished pianist. He was particularly celebrated for his performing partnerships with the baritone Pierre Bernac (who also advised him in vocal writing) and the soprano Denise Duval.  He toured in Europe and America with both of them, and made a number of recordings as a pianist. He was among the first composers to see the importance of the gramophone, and he recorded extensively from 1928 onwards.\nIn his later years, and for decades after his death, Poulenc had a reputation, particularly in his native country, as a humorous, lightweight composer, and his religious music was often overlooked. In the 21st century, more attention has been given to his serious works, with many new productions of Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites and La voix humaine worldwide, and numerous live and recorded performances of his songs and choral music.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40538", "text": "Poulenc's music is essentially diatonic.

When Fait contacts Christophe, a Taiwanese intelligence agent named Su intercepts the conversation and attempts to identify the criminals.\nWhile the crew gathers up as many diamonds as they can, including a bag of black diamonds, Agent Su calls Fait and demands that he and his crew leave the diamonds in the vault, warning him that the police are on the way. However, Fait ignores this warning, and the criminals attempt a daring escape past a SWAT team blockade. While Fait, and his crew members Daria and Tommy, all manage to escape, Agent Su captures Miles and recovers Miles' share of the diamonds. Su is disappointed to find that Miles does not have the black diamonds though. Meanwhile, Fait asks his friend Archie to appraise the black diamonds he had stolen. Arriving at the San Francisco International Airport, Christophe's mysterious employer, Ling, is informed by his assistant Sona, that Christophe has been attacked and that Fait and his gang have taken the black diamonds.\nLater that night, Fait runs into Su. During this inadvertent meeting, Fait receives a phone call from Ling, who demands that Fait hand over the black diamonds. Fait refuses and is subsequently attacked by two of Ling's henchman. With Su's help, he defeats them and escapes. After the fight, Archie tells Fait that some gangsters came to his workshop and demanded the black diamonds as well. After some hesitation, Archie admits that he gave the stones to the gangsters to spare his own life. Fait also receives another call from Ling, who has kidnapped Fait's daughter, Vanessa, to persuade Fait to give up the diamonds. Now with a common enemy, Fait and Su team up to recover the diamonds from the gangsters and rescue Vanessa from Ling.\nFait visits jailed crime lord \"Jump\" Chambers, most likely the employer of the gangsters who had robbed Archie. When Chambers refuses to cooperate, Fait goes to Chambers' night club, hoping to find the stones somewhere in his office. The plan goes awry, and Fait and the gang have to leave empty-handed. Meanwhile, Su and Archie go to an underground club to try to find the gangsters who attacked Archie. Because the club does not allow guests, Su is forced to enter as a fighter in the club's fighting ring. During Su's fight, Archie sees the man they are looking for, recognizing the man's ring. Through this informant, they learn that the diamonds are hidden in the bubble bath in Chamber's office. When they return to the nightclub to retrieve the diamonds, they find that Ling's men have already taken the stones. Meanwhile, while locked in a van, Vanessa, who has been bound and gagged with duct tape frees herself, and finds a cell phone to call her father. Just before the phone's battery runs out, Vanessa gives some clues as to her location. With these clues, the gang surmises that Vanessa is being held in an airport hangar.\nRealizing that Ling will want to auction off the stones, which are actually weapons of mass destruction, the group searches flight schedules to find an airport where a large number of private flights will be landing that night. Finding the right airport, the group races to the hangar, where Ling's auction is already starting. A fight ensues, and Fait and his crew take out members of Ling's team, while Su battles Ling in a one on one fight.

A fifth album entitled Hong Kong is One Big Shopping Mall was released on 26 August 2011, which received numerous awards (including the title of third best album in Cantonese 2011, by Sina Weibo). In October 2012, the band released their sixth album, Lonely Friday, on the Harbour Records label.\nOn 30 November 2011, Hong Kong arts and culture magazine Muse named My Little Airport Hong Kong's 'Next Big Thing' cultural heroes of 2011.

His grandparents made a \"weird deal\" when he was 12 and lost the Bush Brothers company, a deal they were ultimately bitter about, but it allowed Bush to grow up and be whatever he wanted.Throughout childhood, Bush was enrolled in violin lessons and classically trained under the Suzuki method at the University of Tennessee.  The family eventually relocated to Knoxville and by age 11, Bush agreed to play one season in the Knoxville Youth Symphony, before earning the right to lay the violin down for good and start learning the guitar.  As a teenager, Bush stuck with the guitar and began to create original music. It wasn't long before he was writing his own songs and recording homemade albums. He did swimmer electives throughout high school and college, and would write music in his head to the rhythm of his swimming strokes.Bush attended Avon Old Farms Boarding School in Avon, Connecticut, graduating in 1988. He then attended Emory University in Atlanta, earning a degree in Creative Writing.

When Sjakie is renting a car, the Flodders are mistaken for a Russian delegation of scientists and taken to the Plaza Hotel. Sjakie loses the family and has his car towed away, forcing him to take a taxi to the office of his American colleagues, only to get stuck in the New York traffic and thereby arriving to late at the office and at the hotel he booked. The Flodders meanwhile go sightseeing in Manhattan and are invited to the reception of the Roosevelt Foundation which was meant for the Russian doctors. At the reception, a young man named Geoffrey sees daughter Kees and immediately tries to hook up with her, claiming he instantly fell in love.

When spotting the Flodder sons across the road, Sjakie tries to get to them, but gets hit by a car and ends up in hospital with a concussion. That same night, the night club opens again with a more Dutch-oriented theme: bitterballen are served as snacks and daughter Kees does a striptease in a Frau Antje costume. Son Kees secretly steals gasoline from the guests' car, having discovered that gasoline in the United States is far cheaper than in the Netherlands, and stores the stolen fuel in an empty water tank on the roof to make a huge profit back in the Netherlands (while not realising that there is no way he can get the tank to the Netherlands). Meanwhile, Sjakie gets mixed up with another patient at hospital, only to wake up in the morning to discover he has had a transgender operation.\nAfter some days, Johnny, daughter Kees and son Kees meet the muggers from Central Park again and get chased by them through the streets of Manhattan, resulting in the muggers crashing into the New York Stock Exchange, after which the Flodder siblings are arrested. However, when finding the business card of Geoffrey, the police immediately release them, after which the Flodders are met by Geoffrey who asks whether he can take daughter Kees out for the night, which Johnny only allows when Geoffrey pays him $5000. Although daughter Kees is not enthusiastic about Geoffrey, one of his advisers fears the worst and does research on the Flodder family. Soon it becomes clear to the viewer that Geoffrey's father is in fact the president of the United States.

Its plot follows a Los Angeles private investigator who uncovers a series of sinister events while searching for the missing teenage daughter of a former movie actress.\nHackman was nominated for a BAFTA Award for his portrayal of private investigator Harry Moseby. The film has been called \"a seminal modern noir work from the 1970s\", which refers to its relationship with the film noir tradition of detective films. The original screenplay is by Scottish writer Alan Sharp.\nAlthough Night Moves was not considered particularly successful at the time of its release, it has attracted viewers and significant critical attention following its videotape and DVD releases. In 2010, Manohla Dargis described it as \"the great, despairing Night Moves (1975), with Gene Hackman as a private detective who ends up circling the abyss, a no\u2011exit comment on the post-1968, post-Watergate times.\"", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40646", "text": "Harry Moseby is a retired professional football player now working as a private investigator in Los Angeles.

Arlene's only source of income is her daughter's trust fund, but it requires Delly to be living with her. Arlene gives Harry the name of one of Delly's friends in Los Angeles, a mechanic called Quentin. Quentin tells Harry that he last saw Delly at a New Mexico film location, where she started flirting with one of Arlene's old flames, stuntman Marv Ellman. Harry realizes that the injuries to Quentin's face are from fighting the stuntman and sympathizes with his bitterness towards Delly. He travels to the film location and talks to Marv and stunt coordinator Joey Ziegler.

Harry finds Delly staying with Tom and his girlfriend Paula. Harry, Paula, and Delly take a boat trip to go swimming, but Delly becomes distraught when she finds the submerged wreckage of a small plane with the decomposing body of the pilot inside.

He was among the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades and several eras in the history of jazz. He received numerous accolades including the Grammy Award for Best Male Vocal Performance for Hello, Dolly! in 1965, as well as a posthumous win for the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972, and induction into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2017.Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. Around 1922, he followed his mentor, Joe \"King\" Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. He earned a reputation at \"cutting contests\", and his fame reached band leader Fletcher Henderson. He moved to New York City, where he became a featured and musically influential band soloist and recording artist. By the 1950s, he was a national musical icon, appearing regularly in radio and television broadcasts and on film.\nHis best known songs include \"What a Wonderful World\", \"La Vie en Rose\", \"Hello, Dolly!\", \"On the Sunny Side of the Street\", \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\", \"When You're Smiling\" and \"When the Saints Go Marching In\". He collaborated with Ella Fitzgerald, producing three records together: Ella and Louis (1956), Ella and Louis Again (1957), and Porgy and Bess (1959). He also appeared in films such as A Rhapsody in Black and Blue (1932), Cabin in the Sky (1943), High Society (1956), Paris Blues (1961), A Man Called Adam (1966), and Hello, Dolly! (1969).\nWith his instantly recognizable rich, gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser. He was also skilled at scat singing. By the end of Armstrong's life, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\" to wide popularity with White and international audiences. He rarely publicly discussed racial issues, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation in the Little Rock crisis.

Armstrong himself often claimed he was born on July 4, 1900. His parents were Mary Estelle \"Mayann\" Albert and William Armstrong. Mary Albert was from Boutte, Louisiana, and gave birth at home when she was about sixteen. Less than a year and a half later, they had a daughter, Beatrice \"Mama Lucy\" Armstrong (1903\u20131987), who was raised by Albert. William Armstrong abandoned the family shortly thereafter.Louis Armstrong was raised by his grandmother until the age of five, when he was returned to his mother. He spent his youth in poverty in a rough neighborhood known as The Battlefield, on the southern section of Rampart Street. At six he started attending the Fisk School for Boys, a school that accepted black children in the racially segregated school system of New Orleans.\nDuring this time, Armstrong lived with his mother and sister and worked for the Karnoffskys, a family of Lithuanian Jews, at their home. He helped their two sons, Morris and Alex, collect \"rags and bones\" and deliver coal. In 1969, while recovering from heart and kidney problems at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, Armstrong wrote a memoir called Louis Armstrong + the Jewish Family in New Orleans, LA., the year of 1907, describing his time working for the Karnoffsky family.Armstrong writes about singing \"Russian Lullaby\" with the Karnoffsky family when their baby son David was put to bed, and credits the family with teaching him to sing \"from the heart.\" Curiously, Armstrong quotes lyrics for it that appear to be the same as the \"Russian Lullaby\", copyrighted by Irving Berlin in 1927, about twenty years after Armstrong remembered singing it as a child. Gary Zucker, Armstrong's doctor at Beth Israel hospital in 1969, shared Berlin's song lyrics with him, and Armstrong quoted them in the memoir. This inaccuracy may simply be because he wrote the memoir over 60 years after the events described. Regardless, the Karnoffskys treated Armstrong extremely well.

Armstrong himself often claimed he was born on July 4, 1900. His parents were Mary Estelle \"Mayann\" Albert and William Armstrong. Mary Albert was from Boutte, Louisiana, and gave birth at home when she was about sixteen. Less than a year and a half later, they had a daughter, Beatrice \"Mama Lucy\" Armstrong (1903\u20131987), who was raised by Albert. William Armstrong abandoned the family shortly thereafter.Louis Armstrong was raised by his grandmother until the age of five, when he was returned to his mother. He spent his youth in poverty in a rough neighborhood known as The Battlefield, on the southern section of Rampart Street. At six he started attending the Fisk School for Boys, a school that accepted black children in the racially segregated school system of New Orleans.\nDuring this time, Armstrong lived with his mother and sister and worked for the Karnoffskys, a family of Lithuanian Jews, at their home. He helped their two sons, Morris and Alex, collect \"rags and bones\" and deliver coal. In 1969, while recovering from heart and kidney problems at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, Armstrong wrote a memoir called Louis Armstrong + the Jewish Family in New Orleans, LA., the year of 1907, describing his time working for the Karnoffsky family.Armstrong writes about singing \"Russian Lullaby\" with the Karnoffsky family when their baby son David was put to bed, and credits the family with teaching him to sing \"from the heart.\" Curiously, Armstrong quotes lyrics for it that appear to be the same as the \"Russian Lullaby\", copyrighted by Irving Berlin in 1927, about twenty years after Armstrong remembered singing it as a child. Gary Zucker, Armstrong's doctor at Beth Israel hospital in 1969, shared Berlin's song lyrics with him, and Armstrong quoted them in the memoir. This inaccuracy may simply be because he wrote the memoir over 60 years after the events described. Regardless, the Karnoffskys treated Armstrong extremely well. Knowing he lived without a father, they fed and nurtured him.In his memoir, Louis Armstrong + the Jewish Family in New Orleans, La., the Year of 1907, he described his discovery that this family was also subject to discrimination by \"other white folks\" who felt that they were better than Jews: \"I was only seven years old but I could easily see the ungodly treatment that the white folks were handing the poor Jewish family whom I worked for.\" He wrote about what he learned from them: \"how to live\u2014real life and determination.\" His first musical performance may have been at the side of the Karnoffskys' junk wagon.

Once there, they are ambushed by colonial hunters led by Myles Standish, and are rescued by native turkeys led by Chief Broadbeak and his two children, Ranger and Jenny.\nBroadbeak explains that turkeys have been forced underground since the settlers came, and orders Jake and Ranger to spy on the settlers while Reggie and Jenny spring the humans' hunting traps. Ranger and Jake discover that the settlers have already begun preparations for Thanksgiving, and where they keep their weapons.\nJenny is unconvinced Reggie is from the future, but is impressed with his accidental unorthodox way of springing traps.

A figure in the alternative and grunge scenes of the 1990s, her career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the alternative rock band Hole, which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. In 2020, NME named her one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\nLove had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in Portland, Oregon, where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in Dublin and Liverpool before returning to the United States and pursuing an acting career. She appeared in supporting roles in the Alex Cox films Sid and Nancy (1986) and Straight to Hell (1987) before forming the band Hole in Los Angeles with guitarist Eric Erlandson. The group received critical acclaim from underground rock press for their 1991 debut album Pretty on the Inside, produced by Kim Gordon, while their second release, Live Through This (1994), was met with critical accolades and multi-platinum sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance as Althea Leasure in Milo\u0161 Forman's The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, Celebrity Skin (1998), was nominated for three Grammy Awards.\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as Man on the Moon (1999) and Trapped (2002), before releasing her first solo album, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. The subsequent several years were marred with publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug relapse, which resulted in a mandatory lockdown rehabilitation sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became Nobody's Daughter, released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo singles and returned to acting in the network series Sons of Anarchy and Empire. In 2020, she confirmed she was writing new music. Love has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a manga, Princess Ai, between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, Dirty Blonde (2006).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "26_48555", "text": "In 1993, Love and husband Kurt Cobain performed an acoustic set together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Los Angeles, which raised awareness and provided resources for victims of sexual abuse.

In the letter, Love said: \"It's not piracy when kids swap music over the Internet using Napster or Gnutella or Freenet or iMesh or beaming their CDs into a My.MP3.com or MyPlay.com music locker. It's piracy when those guys that run those companies make side deals with the cartel lawyers and label heads so that they can be 'the label's friend', and not the artists'.\" In a subsequent interview with Carrie Fisher, she said that she was interested in starting a union for recording artists, and also discussed race relations in the music industry, advocating for record companies to \"put money back into the black community [whom] white people have been stealing from for years.\"Love has been a long-standing supporter of LGBT causes. She has frequently collaborated with Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, taking part in the center's \"An Evening with Women\" events.

The novel contains a detailed account of the history and repertoire of its imaginary rock band, including concert setlists and album track timings. Each of the novel's chapter headings open with actual famous rock lyrics, whose meanings resonate throughout that chapter.\nMartin has described the book as probably his most ambitious and experimental novel but \"a total commercial disaster\" that almost destroyed his career. Nevertheless, The Armageddon Rag was nominated for the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel, and won the Balrog Award for best novel.Despite its initial commercial failure, the novel remains in print.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40736", "text": "Frustrated former hippie novelist Sandy Blair becomes involved in the investigation of the brutal murder of rock promoter Jamie Lynch, whose heart had been torn from his body. Lynch, a despised rock promoter, had been found dead in a small town in Maine, the victim of a ritualistic murder. Lynch had managed several bands, including the legendary rock group the Nazg\u00fbl (named for the evil Ringwraiths in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings). He was found dead on the 10th anniversary of the Nazg\u00fbl's breakup, with his bloody body placed on top of the band's West Mesa, New Mexico concert poster; during that concert, Nazg\u00fbl lead singer Patrick Henry \"Hobbit\" Hobbins had been mysteriously murdered.\nLynch's high-profile death soon opens the door for a Nazg\u00fbl reunion tour, which slowly begins to eerily mirror the events of their original West Mesa tour. With Lynch out of the way, a disastrous act of arson forces the remaining three members of the Nazg\u00fbl to go on a reunion tour, promoted by a rich man named Edan Morse. The mysterious Morse may or may not have been a left-wing revolutionary in the 1970s, noted for his violent methods. Morse produces a young man who is a doppelganger for Hobbins, who Morse plans to make the lead singer of the reunited Nazg\u00fbl, despite the fact that the doppelganger's musical talents are subpar and he lacks any charisma. Interviewing the surviving members of the band while tracking down his old friends from the 1960s, Blair meditates on the meaning of the flower power generation as he crisscrosses the country. He eventually becomes the Nazg\u00fbl's press agent and is soon swept up in the frenzy of their successful reunion tour and an oncoming supernatural convergence, whose nature he must uncover in order to solve the murders of Lynch and Hobbins.

{"id": "136_483", "question": "What type of music does Whisky Galore! play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_40835", "text": "Whisky Galore! is a 1949 British comedy film produced by Ealing Studios, starring Basil Radford, Bruce Seton, Joan Greenwood and Gordon Jackson. It was the directorial debut of Alexander Mackendrick; the screenplay was by Compton Mackenzie, an adaptation of his 1947 novel Whisky Galore, and Angus MacPhail. The story\u2014based on a true event, the running aground of the SS Politician\u2014concerns a shipwreck off a fictional Scottish island, the inhabitants of which have run out of whisky because of wartime rationing. The islanders find out the ship is carrying 50,000 cases of whisky, some of which they salvage, against the opposition of the local Customs and Excise men.\nIt was filmed on the island of Barra; the weather was so poor that the production over-ran its 10-week schedule by five weeks, and the film went \u00a320,000 over budget. Michael Balcon, the head of the studio, was unimpressed by the initial cut of the film, and one of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added footage and re-edited the film before its release. Like other Ealing comedies, Whisky Galore! explores the actions of a small insular group facing and overcoming a more powerful opponent. An unspoken sense of community runs through the film, and the story reflects a time when the British Empire was weakening.\nWhisky Galore! was well received on release. It came out in the same year as Passport to Pimlico and Kind Hearts and Coronets, leading to 1949 being remembered as one of the peak years of the Ealing comedies. In the US, where Whisky Galore! was renamed Tight Little Island, the film became the first from the studios to achieve box office success. It was followed by a sequel, Rockets Galore!. Whisky Galore! has since been adapted for the stage, and a remake was released in 2016.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40836", "text": "The inhabitants of the isolated Scottish island of Todday in the Outer Hebrides are largely unaffected by wartime rationing until 1943, when the supply of whisky runs out. As a result, gloom descends on the disconsolate islanders. In the midst of this catastrophe, Sergeant Odd returns on leave from the army to court Peggy, the daughter of the local shopkeeper, Joseph Macroon. Odd had previously assisted with setting up the island's Home Guard unit. Meanwhile, Macroon's other daughter, Catriona, has just become engaged to a meek schoolteacher, George Campbell, although Campbell's stern, domineering mother refuses to give her approval.\nDuring a night-time fog, the freighter SS Cabinet Minister runs aground near Todday in heavy fog and begins to sink. Two local inhabitants, the Biffer and Sammy MacCodrun, row out to lend assistance, and learn from its departing crew that the cargo consists of 50,000 cases of whisky. They quickly spread the news.\nCaptain Waggett, the stuffy English commander of the local Home Guard, orders Odd to guard the cargo, but Macroon casually remarks that, by long-standing custom, a man cannot marry without hosting a r\u00e8iteach\u2014a Scottish betrothal ceremony\u2014in which whisky must be served. Taking the hint, the sergeant allows himself to be overpowered, and the locals manage to offload many cases before the ship goes down. Campbell, sent to his room by his mother for a prior transgression, is persuaded to leave through the window and assist with the salvage by MacCodrun. This proves fortunate, as Campbell rescues the Biffer when he is trapped in the sinking freighter. The whisky also gives the previously teetotal Campbell the courage to stand up to his mother and insist that he will marry Catriona.\nA battle of wits ensues between Waggett, who wants to confiscate the salvaged cargo, and the islanders.

In the midst of this catastrophe, Sergeant Odd returns on leave from the army to court Peggy, the daughter of the local shopkeeper, Joseph Macroon. Odd had previously assisted with setting up the island's Home Guard unit. Meanwhile, Macroon's other daughter, Catriona, has just become engaged to a meek schoolteacher, George Campbell, although Campbell's stern, domineering mother refuses to give her approval.\nDuring a night-time fog, the freighter SS Cabinet Minister runs aground near Todday in heavy fog and begins to sink. Two local inhabitants, the Biffer and Sammy MacCodrun, row out to lend assistance, and learn from its departing crew that the cargo consists of 50,000 cases of whisky. They quickly spread the news.\nCaptain Waggett, the stuffy English commander of the local Home Guard, orders Odd to guard the cargo, but Macroon casually remarks that, by long-standing custom, a man cannot marry without hosting a r\u00e8iteach\u2014a Scottish betrothal ceremony\u2014in which whisky must be served. Taking the hint, the sergeant allows himself to be overpowered, and the locals manage to offload many cases before the ship goes down. Campbell, sent to his room by his mother for a prior transgression, is persuaded to leave through the window and assist with the salvage by MacCodrun. This proves fortunate, as Campbell rescues the Biffer when he is trapped in the sinking freighter. The whisky also gives the previously teetotal Campbell the courage to stand up to his mother and insist that he will marry Catriona.\nA battle of wits ensues between Waggett, who wants to confiscate the salvaged cargo, and the islanders.

The game features an A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft that takes part in a variety of missions in West Germany during a hypothetical limited conventional attack by the Warsaw Pact. A-10 boasted one of the most detailed flight models of any game of its era, a physics model that extended to solid-body interactions with the ground and complete aerodynamics for every object in the game, including ordnance. Macworld rated it \"Best Flight Simulator\" in a review of Mac simulations.The game was followed by a sequel named A-10 Cuba!, originally as a stand-alone game on the Mac and  Windows-based PC's, but later re-released on the Mac as a plug-in module for the original game. The Mac OS versions were produced by Parsoft, while the PC version of Cuba was a joint production with Activision.

Although Hellcats managed to do a lot with limited capabilities of the hardware, the game had a number of obvious drawbacks. For one, the missions were written in computer code as part of the game engine, which meant the user could not add new missions or modify the existing ones. Another problem was that the vehicles and other objects in the game were hard-coded with various behaviors, which likewise made them difficult to customize. Even the game map itself existed only in the code.\nParsoft started experimenting with a plug-in system to replace the hard-coded objects in Hellcats. Known as the Virtual Battlefield Environment (VBE), the system still required programming tools to build out the objects, but once they were completed they could be loaded into the game engine from individual files. Adding these into a game simply required the files to be placed in the appropriate directories in the user's file system. VBE allowed anything to be added in this fashion; aircraft, vehicles, missions, and maps.\nAnother problem with Hellcats was its very basic physics, which simulated only the most basic flight dynamics and resulted in flight that was unrealistic in a number of ways. There were no structural limits either, allowing a number of unrealistic extremely high-g maneuvers. A completely new flight engine was created for the VBE system that simulated subsonic aerodynamics with a fair degree of realism, with effects like dutch roll and adverse yaw \"falling out\" of the engine without being deliberately coded in. Additionally, the system included a new physics engine that featured simple finite element analysis that allowed damage to be realistically simulated, including its effects on the flight dynamics of the aircraft. The resulting simulation was arguably the most advanced of its era.\nAll of this was combined with an improved version of the graphics engine developed for Hellcats, allowing players to use multiple monitors and any resolution their machine could support. Hellcats used a  polygon-based flat-shaded system that used differential updating to avoid bottlenecks in the computer bus and thereby improve frame rates. A-10 retained the basics from Hellcats, but added the ability for small areas of texture mapping to be applied, which was used on the vehicles to add roundels and squadron markings. A combination of improved code in the engine and the rapid improvement in computer performance since the release of Hellcats allowed the new engine to feature greatly increased scene complexity.\nEarly versions of the game were shown at MacWorld Boston in the summer of 1993. At the time the physics and graphics engines were operational, although there was no \"game\" per-se. The world consisted of a single-runway airbase and a nearby target range with several \"bullseye\" targets.

McCleery's method of staging employed minimal sets and props well lit within a black background, enabling cameras to move about with much freedom in the darkness, picking up shots from any angle. McCleery's skill with this type of staging led directly to his producer role with NBC's Matinee Theatre. The technique put the focus directly on the characters and dialogue rather than scenery. The way that McCleery used cameras became known as the \"cameo shot\" and was imitated widely.Jim Buckley of the Pewter Plough Playhouse (Cambria, California) recalled:\n\nWhen Al McCleery got back to the States, he originated a most ambitious theatrical TV series for NBC called Matinee Theatre: to televise five different stage plays per week live, airing around noon in order to promote color TV (which had just been developed) to the American housewife as she labored over her ironing. Al was the producer. He hired five directors and five art directors. Richard Bennett, one of our first early presidents of the Pewter Plough Corporation, was one of the directors and I was one of the art directors and, as soon as we were through televising one play, we had lunch and then met to plan next week\u2019s show. That was over 50 years ago, and I\u2019m trying to think; I believe the TV art director is (or was) his own set decorator (selecting furnishings and hand props)\u2014yes, of course!

The games are crossover titles that feature characters, items, music, and stages from various Nintendo franchises, as well as from several third-party franchises.

To assist players during a battle, items sometimes appear on the battlefield, most of which represent the various video games represented in the series. An item called a Smash Ball allows players to use a powerful, character-specific attack known as a \"Final Smash\".

These characters can be transferred between the 3DS and Wii U versions of the game, as well as certain items earned in specific modes. Additionally, players can use Amiibo to train computer-controlled players and import them into a match. Both versions of the game support local and online multiplayer. Whereas local and online matches with friends have fully customizable rules, online matches with strangers are divided into two modes: \"For Fun\" and \"For Glory\". For Fun features random stages and items, with timed matches only and Omega stages omitted, while For Glory features stock matches with no items exclusively on Omega stages and features both standard Smash and 1-on-1 battles, all of which the player's wins and losses are recorded from For Glory. Customized characters, Mii Fighters, and Amiibo cannot be used in online matches against strangers.

The game was later revealed to be a joint-project between Bandai Namco Studios and Sora Ltd., with various staff members from Bandai Namco's Soulcalibur and Tekken series assisting Sakurai in development. Other companies also assisted with its development, such as tri-Crescendo. Sakurai, who was previously the sole person responsible for balance in the series' multiple fighters, has involved more staff to further improve the game's competitive balance. The game was officially revealed at E3 2013 on June 11, 2013, during a Nintendo Direct. Along with screenshots being posted each weekday on the game's official website and Miiverse community, various cinematic trailers were released, introducing each of the brand new fighters. Sakurai chose to use these trailers, which benefit from Internet sharing, as opposed to including a story campaign similar to the Subspace Emissary mode featured in Brawl, as he believed the impact of seeing the mode's cinematic cutscenes for the first time was ruined by people uploading said scenes to video sharing websites.At E3 2013, Sakurai stated that the tripping mechanic introduced in Brawl had been omitted, with him also stating that the gameplay was between the fast-paced and competitive style of Melee and the slower and more casual style of Brawl. While the game does not feature cross-platform play between the Wii U and 3DS, due to each version featuring certain exclusive stages and game modes, there is the option to transfer customized characters and items between the two versions. The game builds upon the previous game's third-party involvement with the addition of third-party characters such as Capcom's Mega Man and Bandai Namco's Pac-Man, as well as the return of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. This involvement expands beyond playable characters, as other third-party characters, such as Ubisoft's Rayman, are also included in the game as trophies. The addition of Mii characters was made in response to the growing number of requests from fans to have their dream characters included in the game. To prevent potential bullying, as well as to maintain game balance online, Mii Fighters cannot be used in online matches against strangers. The decision to release the Wii U version at a later date from the 3DS version was made to allow each version to receive a dedicated debugging period. Hardware limitations on the Nintendo 3DS led to various design choices, such as the removal of mid-match transformations, the lack of Circle Pad Pro support, and the absence of the Ice Climbers, from the NES game Ice Climber, who were previously playable in both Melee and Brawl.In late August 2014, a series of allegedly leaked photos and videos of the 3DS version were uploaded to the Internet, revealing at the time several unannounced fighters. The original videos were removed shortly thereafter citing a copyright claim by Nintendo of America.

Trophy Rush has players clear out falling crates to build up a Fever meter and quickly earn new trophies and customization items.\nIn addition to a moderation system to prevent griefing, the game features an online ranking system called \"Global Smash Power\" for a player's solo mode score, which shows how many other players someone has outscored, rather than listing their position on a leaderboard. Although the game does not feature a ranking system for online matches, matchmaking between players of similar skill levels was introduced. Online also features Spectator Mode, where spectators can place bets on other players to win more gold, and Conquest, in which players can support selected characters by playing as them online, earning rewards if their supported team wins, and earning bonus rewards for going on a winning streak. Online services are set to be discontinued by April 2024.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40902", "text": "Former Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata first announced that a new Super Smash Bros. game was planned for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U at E3 2011 in June 2011, but development only officially began following the completion of series creator Masahiro Sakurai's other project, Kid Icarus: Uprising, in March 2012. The game was later revealed to be a joint-project between Bandai Namco Studios and Sora Ltd., with various staff members from Bandai Namco's Soulcalibur and Tekken series assisting Sakurai in development. Other companies also assisted with its development, such as tri-Crescendo. Sakurai, who was previously the sole person responsible for balance in the series' multiple fighters, has involved more staff to further improve the game's competitive balance. The game was officially revealed at E3 2013 on June 11, 2013, during a Nintendo Direct. Along with screenshots being posted each weekday on the game's official website and Miiverse community, various cinematic trailers were released, introducing each of the brand new fighters. Sakurai chose to use these trailers, which benefit from Internet sharing, as opposed to including a story campaign similar to the Subspace Emissary mode featured in Brawl, as he believed the impact of seeing the mode's cinematic cutscenes for the first time was ruined by people uploading said scenes to video sharing websites.At E3 2013, Sakurai stated that the tripping mechanic introduced in Brawl had been omitted, with him also stating that the gameplay was between the fast-paced and competitive style of Melee and the slower and more casual style of Brawl. While the game does not feature cross-platform play between the Wii U and 3DS, due to each version featuring certain exclusive stages and game modes, there is the option to transfer customized characters and items between the two versions. The game builds upon the previous game's third-party involvement with the addition of third-party characters such as Capcom's Mega Man and Bandai Namco's Pac-Man, as well as the return of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. This involvement expands beyond playable characters, as other third-party characters, such as Ubisoft's Rayman, are also included in the game as trophies. The addition of Mii characters was made in response to the growing number of requests from fans to have their dream characters included in the game. To prevent potential bullying, as well as to maintain game balance online, Mii Fighters cannot be used in online matches against strangers. The decision to release the Wii U version at a later date from the 3DS version was made to allow each version to receive a dedicated debugging period. Hardware limitations on the Nintendo 3DS led to various design choices, such as the removal of mid-match transformations, the lack of Circle Pad Pro support, and the absence of the Ice Climbers, from the NES game Ice Climber, who were previously playable in both Melee and Brawl.In late August 2014, a series of allegedly leaked photos and videos of the 3DS version were uploaded to the Internet, revealing at the time several unannounced fighters. The original videos were removed shortly thereafter citing a copyright claim by Nintendo of America. These leaks were confirmed on September 11, 2014, when various gamers in Japan and Taiwan obtained the 3DS version two days prior to its release date and streamed footage of the game on Twitch.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Holmes would later describe the photograph as the favorite of the many she had taken in her career as it \"...told just what the world should be like\". The photograph was considered so controversial that an editor at Life sought personal approval from Henry Luce, the magazine's publisher, who said it should be published. The publication of the image caused letters of protest to be written to the magazine, and singer Harry Belafonte subsequently said of the publication that \"When that photo hit, in this national publication, it was if a barrier had been broken\". The controversy that resulted from the photograph had a seminal effect on the trajectory of Eckstine's career. Tony Bennett would recall that \"It changed everything...Before that, he had a tremendous following...and it just offended the white community\", a sentiment shared by pianist Billy Taylor who said that the \"coverage and that picture just slammed the door shut for him\".In 1951, Eckstine performed at the seventh Cavalcade of Jazz concert held on July 8 at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. Also featured were Lionel Hampton and his Revue, Percy Mayfield, Jimmy Witherspoon, Joe Liggins and The Honeydrippers and Roy Brown.Among Eckstine's recordings of the 1950s was a 1957 duet with Sarah Vaughan, \"Passing Strangers\", a minor hit for them in 1957, but an initial No. 22 success in the UK Singles Chart.The 1960 Las Vegas live album, No Cover, No Minimum, featured Eckstine taking a few trumpet solos and showcasing his nightclub act.

Benoten believed after expressing hurt and anger to her ex-lover in the initial lyrics, Gaga has a taunting desire for revenge in the closing line \"Why are you so speechless?\" Exploring Gaga's \"musical intertexts\" on The Fame Monster, authors Lori Burns, Alyssa Woods and Marc Lafrance wrote that in \"Speechless\", she adopts a 1970s rock ballad style reminiscent of artists like Mercury, John Lennon and Elton John. The authors drew thematic connections to Mercury's desire to seek acceptance as an outsider in \"Somebody to Love\", Lennon's pursuit of a utopian society in \"Imagine\" and John's emphasis on \"pure devotion through music and word\" in \"Your Song\". Burns, Woods and Lafrance thought that by invoking this \"genealogy\", Gaga aims to promote unbiased love and a new world order emphasizing equality and fairness. As such, they deemed \"Speechless\" a sociomusical activism piece.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Recording sessions for tracks that appear on the album took place on May 26, 1958, at Columbia's 30th Street Studio and September 9, 1958, at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. 1958 Miles consists of three songs featured on side two of the LP album Jazz Track, which was released in November 1959, one song from the same session not appearing in the album (\"Love for Sale\"), and three recordings from Davis' live performance at the Plaza Hotel with his ensemble sextet. The recording date at 30th Street Studio served as the first documented session to feature pianist Bill Evans performing in Davis' group.\nThe sessions for tracks on the album in mid-1958, along with the Milestones sessions from earlier that year, were seen by many music writers as elemental in Miles Davis' transition from bebop to the modal style of jazz and were viewed as precursors to his best-known work, Kind of Blue. Following audio engineering and digital restoration by engineer Larry Keyes at Sony Music New York Studio, the album was reissued on compact disc in 1991 as part of Columbia's Jazz Masterpieces Series. For later reissues, the album was retitled as '58 Sessions Featuring Stella by Starlight or '58 Miles Featuring Stella by Starlight. The complete 1958 sessions for Columbia were issued on the box set The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane, and Jazz at the Plaza was reissued in 2001. The first four tracks were also released on a bonus disc of the 50 Anniversary Collector's Edition of Kind of Blue.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40953", "text": "In 1958, Miles Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, seeing its increasingly complex chord changes as hindering musical creativity. Five years earlier, jazz pianist, composer and theorist George Russell published his Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization (1953), which offered an alternative to the practice of musical improvisation based on chords. Abandoning the traditional major and minor key relationships of classical music, Russell developed a new formulation using musical scales, or a series of scales, for improvisations. Russell's approach to improvisation came to be known as modal in jazz. Davis viewed Russell's methods of composition as a means of getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled as \"thick\".In contrast to the conventional method of composing during the time, modal compositions were to be written as a series of sketches in which each performer is given a set of scales that defines the parameters of their improvisation. Modal composition, with its reliance on musical scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, \"a return to melody\". According to Davis, \"Classical composers\u2014some of them\u2014have been writing this way for years, but jazz musicians seldom have\". In early 1958, Davis began using this approach with his sextet, a jazz ensemble made up of alto sax player Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley, tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. Influenced by Russell's ideas, Davis implemented his first modal composition with the title track of Milestones (1958), which was based on two modes, recorded in April of that year. Instead of soloing in the straight, conventional, melodic way, Davis's new style of improvisation featured rapid mode and scale changes played against sparse chord changes. Davis' acclaimed collaboration with Gil Evans on Porgy and Bess gave him an opportunity to experiment with Russell's concept, as Evans' third stream compositions for Davis contained only a musical scale and no chords, the basis for modality.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40954", "text": "As parts of Jazz Track and Jazz at the Plaza, respectively, the '58 Sessions chronicled the transition from the brawny agitation of Milestones, to the cerebral tranquility of Kind of Blue. The recording sessions also became known as a stepping stone in Davis' move from bebop to modal jazz. The live side in particular was seen by critics as a glimpse at the sextet that would record Kind of Blue. The complementary and seemingly spontaneous style of performance ethic and the relationship between Davis and his musicians was fundamental for his work during these sessions and improved onto the Kind of Blue sessions.\nJazz historian and journalist Ira Gitler has considered 1958 Miles to be one of Davis' best works, while also noting that he was \"very taken with the performances\", alluding to the album's recordings after Gitler had listened to them. In the 1979 LP reissue liner notes, Gitler wrote \"These prime cuts of the Miles Davis Sextet, representative of what this most influential leader and his trendsetting band of that time, were doing in that particular portion of 1958, are a most welcome addition to the collectors library.\" The live portion of the album recorded at The Plaza Hotel was noted by critics as an early stage of the new sextet. Music writer Nicholas Taylor later wrote of the Plaza set:\n\nAn interesting and puzzling period piece, documenting the sextet exploring a sound that would soon morph into the rich tapestry of their 1959 masterpiece ...

Five years earlier, jazz pianist, composer and theorist George Russell published his Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization (1953), which offered an alternative to the practice of musical improvisation based on chords. Abandoning the traditional major and minor key relationships of classical music, Russell developed a new formulation using musical scales, or a series of scales, for improvisations. Russell's approach to improvisation came to be known as modal in jazz. Davis viewed Russell's methods of composition as a means of getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled as \"thick\".In contrast to the conventional method of composing during the time, modal compositions were to be written as a series of sketches in which each performer is given a set of scales that defines the parameters of their improvisation. Modal composition, with its reliance on musical scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, \"a return to melody\". According to Davis, \"Classical composers\u2014some of them\u2014have been writing this way for years, but jazz musicians seldom have\". In early 1958, Davis began using this approach with his sextet, a jazz ensemble made up of alto sax player Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley, tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. Influenced by Russell's ideas, Davis implemented his first modal composition with the title track of Milestones (1958), which was based on two modes, recorded in April of that year. Instead of soloing in the straight, conventional, melodic way, Davis's new style of improvisation featured rapid mode and scale changes played against sparse chord changes. Davis' acclaimed collaboration with Gil Evans on Porgy and Bess gave him an opportunity to experiment with Russell's concept, as Evans' third stream compositions for Davis contained only a musical scale and no chords, the basis for modality.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40954", "text": "As parts of Jazz Track and Jazz at the Plaza, respectively, the '58 Sessions chronicled the transition from the brawny agitation of Milestones, to the cerebral tranquility of Kind of Blue. The recording sessions also became known as a stepping stone in Davis' move from bebop to modal jazz. The live side in particular was seen by critics as a glimpse at the sextet that would record Kind of Blue. The complementary and seemingly spontaneous style of performance ethic and the relationship between Davis and his musicians was fundamental for his work during these sessions and improved onto the Kind of Blue sessions.\nJazz historian and journalist Ira Gitler has considered 1958 Miles to be one of Davis' best works, while also noting that he was \"very taken with the performances\", alluding to the album's recordings after Gitler had listened to them. In the 1979 LP reissue liner notes, Gitler wrote \"These prime cuts of the Miles Davis Sextet, representative of what this most influential leader and his trendsetting band of that time, were doing in that particular portion of 1958, are a most welcome addition to the collectors library.\" The live portion of the album recorded at The Plaza Hotel was noted by critics as an early stage of the new sextet.

{"id": "136_524", "question": "What type of music does Earl Scruggs play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_40975", "text": "Earl Eugene Scruggs (January 6, 1924 \u2013 March 28, 2012) was an American musician noted for popularizing a three-finger banjo picking style, now called \"Scruggs style\", which is a defining characteristic of bluegrass music. His three-finger style of playing was radically different from the traditional way the five-string banjo had previously been played. This new style of playing became popular and elevated the banjo from its previous role as a background rhythm instrument to featured solo status. He popularized the instrument across several genres of music.\nScruggs' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in Bill Monroe's band, the Blue Grass Boys. \"Bluegrass\" eventually became the name for an entire genre of country music. Despite considerable success with Monroe, performing on the Grand Ole Opry and recording classic hits such as \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", Scruggs resigned from the group in 1946 because of their exhausting touring schedule. Fellow band member Lester Flatt resigned as well, and he and Scruggs later paired up in the duo Flatt and Scruggs. Scruggs' banjo instrumental \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" was released in 1949 and became an enduring hit. The song experienced a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. The song won two Grammy Awards and, in 2005, was selected for the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit.\nFlatt and Scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\", the theme music for the television sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies\u2014the first Scruggs recording to reach number one on the Billboard charts. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 singles. The duo broke up in 1969, chiefly because, while Scruggs wanted to switch styles to fit a more modern sound, Flatt was a traditionalist who opposed the change and believed doing so would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists. Although each of them formed a new band to match their visions, neither of them ever regained the success they had achieved as a team.\nScruggs received four Grammy awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a National Medal of Arts. He became a member of the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1985, Flatt and Scruggs were inducted together into the Country Music Hall of Fame and named, as a duo, number 24 on CMT's \"40 Greatest Men of Country Music\". Scruggs was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the United States. Four works by Scruggs have been placed in the Grammy Hall of Fame. After Scruggs' death in 2012 at age 88, the Earl Scruggs Center was founded in Shelby, North Carolina, near his birthplace with the aid of a federal grant and corporate donors. The center is a $5.5 million facility that features the musical contributions of Scruggs and serves as an educational center providing classes and field trips for students.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40976", "text": "Earl Scruggs was born January 6, 1924, in the Flint Hill community of Cleveland County, North Carolina, a small community just outside of Boiling Springs, about 10 miles west of Shelby. His father, George Elam Scruggs, was a farmer and a bookkeeper who died of a protracted illness when Earl was four years old. Upon his father's death, Scruggs' mother, Georgia Lula Ruppe (called Lula), was left to take care of the farm and five children, of which Earl was the youngest.The family members all played music. The father played an open back banjo using the frailing technique, though as an adult Earl had no recollection of his father's playing. Mrs. Scruggs played the pump organ. Earl's siblings, older brothers Junie and Horace and older sisters Eula Mae and Ruby, all played banjo and guitar. Scruggs recalled a visit to his uncle's home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named Mack Woolbright, who played a finger-picking style and had recorded for Columbia Records. It made an impression on Scruggs, who said, \"He'd sit in the rocking chair, and he'd pick some and it was just amazing. I couldn't imagine\u2014he was the first, what I call a good banjo player.\" Scruggs then took up the instrument\u2014he was too small to hold it at first and improvised by setting his brother Junie's banjo beside him on the floor. He moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing. After his father's death, Scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music, and when not in school or doing farm chores, spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing. His first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40977", "text": "Scruggs is noted for popularizing a three-finger banjo-picking style now called \"Scruggs style\" that has become a defining characteristic of bluegrass music. Prior to Scruggs, most banjo players used the frailing or clawhammer technique, which consists of holding the fingers bent like a claw and moving the entire hand in a downward motion so that the strings are struck with the back of the middle fingernail. This motion is followed by striking the thumb on a single string. The three-finger style of playing is radically different from frailing; the hand remains stationary and only the fingers and thumb move, somewhat similar to classical guitar technique. Scruggs style also involves using picks on three digits (see photo), each plucking individual strings\u2014downward with the thumb, then upward with the index and middle finger in sequence.

His father, George Elam Scruggs, was a farmer and a bookkeeper who died of a protracted illness when Earl was four years old. Upon his father's death, Scruggs' mother, Georgia Lula Ruppe (called Lula), was left to take care of the farm and five children, of which Earl was the youngest.The family members all played music. The father played an open back banjo using the frailing technique, though as an adult Earl had no recollection of his father's playing. Mrs. Scruggs played the pump organ. Earl's siblings, older brothers Junie and Horace and older sisters Eula Mae and Ruby, all played banjo and guitar. Scruggs recalled a visit to his uncle's home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named Mack Woolbright, who played a finger-picking style and had recorded for Columbia Records. It made an impression on Scruggs, who said, \"He'd sit in the rocking chair, and he'd pick some and it was just amazing. I couldn't imagine\u2014he was the first, what I call a good banjo player.\" Scruggs then took up the instrument\u2014he was too small to hold it at first and improvised by setting his brother Junie's banjo beside him on the floor. He moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing. After his father's death, Scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music, and when not in school or doing farm chores, spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing. His first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40977", "text": "Scruggs is noted for popularizing a three-finger banjo-picking style now called \"Scruggs style\" that has become a defining characteristic of bluegrass music. Prior to Scruggs, most banjo players used the frailing or clawhammer technique, which consists of holding the fingers bent like a claw and moving the entire hand in a downward motion so that the strings are struck with the back of the middle fingernail. This motion is followed by striking the thumb on a single string. The three-finger style of playing is radically different from frailing; the hand remains stationary and only the fingers and thumb move, somewhat similar to classical guitar technique. Scruggs style also involves using picks on three digits (see photo), each plucking individual strings\u2014downward with the thumb, then upward with the index and middle finger in sequence. When done skillfully and in rapid sequence, the style allows any digit (though usually the thumb) to play a melody, while the other two digits play arpeggios of the melody line.

Michael fantasizes about one day building a new home on the plot of land and aims to one day have Santonix, a famed Italian architect whom he met through a client, design the home.\nWhile photographing Gypsy's Acre, Michael meets Ellie Thomsen, a young American visiting England, who is quickly taken by Michael's fantastical nature. While exploring the property, the two encounter Miss Townsend, a mysterious old woman who tells Michael that Gypsy's Acre is for sale, but that it is a cursed land. Ellie leaves England and embarks on the remainder of her trip through Switzerland and Italy with Greta, her German language tutor who has taken on the role of a personal assistant. In Ellie's absence, Michael learns that she is in fact one of the richest young women in the world. He confronts her about this when she returns to England, but she explains she did not want to tell him as she thought it would dissuade him from pursuing her.

Ellie welcomes of her presence, but Michael dislikes her. Frank and the other family members approach Greta with similar scepticism, and wish to distance her from Ellie.

An autopsy suggests she died of unexpected cardiac arrest, but Michael contests this during the inquest, believing there may have been foul play. The police attempt to trace Miss Townsend but are unable to locate her. After the inquest, Andrew notifies Michael that Ellie made him the sole beneficiary of her estate, and urges Michael to travel to the United States to tend to Ellie's business dealings there.

From a working class background, Michael aspires to a life of luxury and is obsessed with the fine arts. Through his travels as a chauffeur, he discovers a spot along the Devon coast known as Gypsy's Acre, where a dilapidated Victorian mansion sits. Michael fantasizes about one day building a new home on the plot of land and aims to one day have Santonix, a famed Italian architect whom he met through a client, design the home.\nWhile photographing Gypsy's Acre, Michael meets Ellie Thomsen, a young American visiting England, who is quickly taken by Michael's fantastical nature. While exploring the property, the two encounter Miss Townsend, a mysterious old woman who tells Michael that Gypsy's Acre is for sale, but that it is a cursed land. Ellie leaves England and embarks on the remainder of her trip through Switzerland and Italy with Greta, her German language tutor who has taken on the role of a personal assistant. In Ellie's absence, Michael learns that she is in fact one of the richest young women in the world. He confronts her about this when she returns to England, but she explains she did not want to tell him as she thought it would dissuade him from pursuing her. She also reveals that, while visiting Italy, she was able to arrange a meeting with Santonix about building Michael's dream home. Furthermore, she reveals she has purchased Gypsy's Acre.\nThough initially angered by her deceit, Michael eventually relents, and he and Ellie marry in Wales. Ellie attempts to keep the marriage secret, as she fears her stepmother, Cora, and other family members may attempt to bribe Michael to divorce her based on his lower social class, but the union quickly makes international headlines. The family's attorney, whom Ellie lovingly refers to as \"Uncle\" Andrew swiftly attempts to buy Michael off, but he declines, insisting he and Ellie are in love. The couple subsequently purchases a local antique shop to operate.\nAs construction of the home begins, Greta arrives, announcing she has taken a secretarial job in London and begins to slowly infiltrate the couple's new life together. Ellie welcomes of her presence, but Michael dislikes her. Frank and the other family members approach Greta with similar scepticism, and wish to distance her from Ellie. At the house, Ellie becomes unnerved when she notices Miss Townsend staring at the home from the fields below for hours at a time. While Michael attends an auction in the city, Ellie goes missing while out riding her horse. Her body is subsequently found in the woods on Gypsy's Acre. An autopsy suggests she died of unexpected cardiac arrest, but Michael contests this during the inquest, believing there may have been foul play. The police attempt to trace Miss Townsend but are unable to locate her. After the inquest, Andrew notifies Michael that Ellie made him the sole beneficiary of her estate, and urges Michael to travel to the United States to tend to Ellie's business dealings there.

Brouwer was an important innovator of genre painting through his vivid depictions of peasants, soldiers and other \"lower class\" individuals engaged in drinking, smoking, card or dice playing, fighting, music making etc. in taverns or rural settings. Brouwer contributed to the development of the genre of tronies, i.e. head or facial studies, which investigate varieties of expression. In his final year he produced a few landscapes of a tragic intensity.  Brouwer's work had an important influence on the next generation of Flemish and Dutch genre painters. Although Brouwer produced only a small body of work,  Dutch masters Peter Paul Rubens and Rembrandt collected it.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_41144", "text": "There are still a number of unresolved questions surrounding the early life and career of Adriaen Brouwer.  The early Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken included multiple erroneous statements and fanciful stories about Brouwer in his The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters of 1718\u201319.  The most glaring mistakes of Houbraken were to place Brouwer's place of birth in Haarlem in the Dutch Republic and to identify Frans Hals as his master.\nIt is now generally accepted that Brouwer was born in Oudenaarde in Flanders in 1605 or 1606.  His father who was also called Adriaen worked as a tapestry designer in Oudenaarde, at the time an important centre for tapestry production in Flanders.  The father died in poverty when Adriaen the younger was only 15 or 16 years old.  Brouwer had by that time already left the paternal home.Brouwer worked in Antwerp in 1622. By March 1625 Adriaen Brouwer was recorded in Amsterdam where he resided in the inn of the painter Barend van Someren, another Flemish artist who had taken up residence in the Dutch Republic. Brouwer is further recorded on 23 July 1626 as a notary's witness when he signed a statement of Barend van Someren and Adriaen van Nieulandt about a sale of pictures in Amsterdam.

The opera made its first appearance at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice on 6 February 1813, less than a month after the premiere of his previous opera Il signor Bruschino. The overture, borrowed from La pietra del paragone, is a popular example of Rossini's characteristic style and is regularly performed in concert and recorded.\nConsidered by Stendhal, Rossini's earliest biographer, to be \"high amongst the composer's masterworks\", and describing it as \"a genuine thunderbolt out of a clear, blue sky for the Italian lyric theatre,\" his librettist Gaetano Rossi notes that, with it, \"Rossini rose to glory\". Richard Osborne proclaims it to be \"his fully fledged opera seria and it established him, more or less instantly, as Italy's leading composer of contemporary opera.\"Although the original version had a happy ending (as required by the opera seria tradition), soon after the Venice premiere, Rossini\u2014who was more of a Neo-classicist than a Romantic, notes Servadio\u2014had the poet Luigi Lechi rework the libretto to emulate the original tragic ending by Voltaire. In this new ending, presented at the Teatro Comunale in Ferrara on 21 March 1813, Tancredi wins the battle but is mortally wounded, and only then does he learn that Amenaide never betrayed him. Argirio marries the lovers in time for Tancredi to die in his wife's arms.\nAs has been stated by Philip Gossett and Patricia Brauner, it was the rediscovery of the score of this ending in 1974 (although elsewhere Gossett provides evidence that it was 1976) that resulted in the version which is usually performed today.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_41176", "text": "By the time he was twenty years old, Rossini's reputation had grown such that  he was regarded as \"'a maestro di cartello', a composer whose name alone guarantees a public\". Success with La pietra del paragone for Milan in September was great, but delays caused him to be late in Venice for his next commission at the Teatro San Mois\u00e8, L'occasione fa il ladro. Other comedies had preceded L'occasione, but its success ensured a fifth opera for that house. This was Il Signor Bruschino, which was presented on 27 January 1813 and which the composer wrote more-or-less parallel to preparing Tancredi, a commission for this opera having been accepted from Venice's most prestigious house, La Fenice, the previous autumn.\nOther treatments of the Tancredi story had been prepared, the most recent being that of Stefano Pavesi in 1812. However, many of Rossini's formal inventions, seen in his earlier one-act operas, are here incorporated with great effect and formalism.

Other changes included Roggiero becoming a tenor with a new aria Torni d'amor la face, two different arias being composed for Argirio, and both duets for Tancredi and Amenaide being restored to their original locations.While Tancredi and Amenaide are happily reunited, he is given \"an entirely new rondo in lieu of the more elaborate gran scena of the original score after Tancredi learns from Argirio that her letter was written for him, and not for Solamir (rather than there being a denial from Solamir).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41177", "text": "19th century\nTancredi premiered in February 1813 at La Fenice in Venice with Adelaide Malanotte in the title role.

Gossett established in 1971 that, later, Rossini also participated in other revisions for performances elsewhere in Italy, including those at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna in 1814 and the Naples premiere given at the Teatro del Fondo in 1816 and again in 1818.However, Heather Hadlock notes that it was the Milanese version of December 1813 which became \"something like a definitive form, and in this form it took Italy by storm\".  Other Italian houses presented the Venice version, including the Teatro Apollo in Rome (1814), the Teatro Regio di Torino (1814 and 1829), La Fenice again (1815, 1823 and 1833), and the Teatro San Mois\u00e8 in Venice in March 1816 when, in another revision, it is the dying Solamir who professes Amenaide's innocence, and Tancredi returns home in triumph.\nPhilip Gossett's research in 1971 states that \"until about 1825 the musical text was rather fluid.

The opera was first performed in England at the King's Theatre in London on 4 May 1820 with Fanny Corri-Paltoni as Amenaide. Its French premiere was given by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique Italien at the Salle Louvois in Paris on 23 April 1822 with Giuditta Pasta in the title role. It was seen in Portugal for the first time at the Teatro Nacional de S\u00e3o Carlos on 18 September 1822 (as Tancredo) and was given its La Scala premiere on 8 November 1823 with Brigida Lorenzani as Tancredi.The United States premiere occurred on 31 December 1825 at the Park Theatre in New York City using the revised Ferrara version by Lechi. The Paris Op\u00e9ra mounted the work for the first time with Maria Malibran in the title role on 30 March 1829. After an 1833 revival at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, Tancredi was not mounted again until almost 120 years later.\n20th century and beyond \nThe Maggio Musicale Fiorentino revived the work on 17 May 1952 with Giulietta Simionato in the title role, Teresa Stich-Randall as Amenaide, Francesco Albanese as Argirio, Mario Petri as Orbazzano, and Tullio Serafin conducting. The opera was given at the Collegiate Theatre as part of the Camden Festival in April 1971 by the Basilica Opera.With the discovery of the long-lost music for the March 1813 Ferrara revision and the resulting preparation and completion of the critical edition, the work was revived when mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, who had expressed interest as early as 1972 in performing the Ferrara edition if it ever came to light took on the title role at the Houston Grand Opera on 13 October 1977. Horne, who quickly became strongly associated with that role, insisted on the tragic Ferrara ending, citing that it is more consistent with the overall tone of the opera and that she \"did not find the happy ending convincing\". Indeed, most of the recordings of this opera today use the Ferrara conclusion, while some include the Venice finale as an extra track.\nHorne's triumphant performances as Tancredi in Houston soon led to invitations from other opera houses to sing the role, and it is largely through her efforts that the opera enjoyed a surge of revivals during the latter half of the 20th century. She sang the part for performances at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma (1977), the San Francisco Opera (1979), the Aix-en-Provence Festival (1981), La Fenice (1981, 1983), and the Lyric Opera of Chicago (1989) among others.\nContralto Ewa Podle\u015b achieved recognition in the title role, performing it at the Vlaamse Opera (1991), La Scala (1993), the Berlin State Opera (1996), Polish National Opera at Warsaw (2000), the Canadian Opera Company (2005), the Caramoor International Music Festival (2006), the Teatro Real (2007), and Opera Boston (2009) among others. She also recorded the role in 1995. Bulgarian mezzo-soprano Vesselina Kasarova has also been praised in the role, singing it at the Salzburg Festival (1992), with the Opera Orchestra of New York (1997), and on a 1996 recording with the Bavarian Radio Chorus and Munich Radio Orchestra.\nPier Luigi Pizzi staged a new production of Tancredi for the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro in 1982\nwhich originally utilised both the tragic and happy endings \u2013 the former being interpolated as a \"dream sequence\" for Amenaide. He also designed both costumes and scenery. The production was conducted by Gianluigi Gelmetti and featured Lucia Valentini Terrani in the title role, as well as Dalmacio Gonzales as Argirio, Katia Ricciarelli as Amenaide, Giancarlo Luccardi as Orbazzano and, as Isaura, Bernadette Manca di Nissa \u2013 who later went on to perform the title role for the 1992 live DVD recording. The production was also revived at Pesaro in 1991, 1999, and 2004.\nTancredi was staged at 2003 at Polish National Opera at Warsaw, in the performance directed by Tomasz Konina and conducted by Alberto Zedda, the title role was sung by Ewa Podle\u015b, with original tragic ending. The second production in Poland took place in Warsaw Chamber Opera in 2008.\nIn 2005 the production went to Rome and Florence (where it was filmed for DVD with Daniela Barcellona in the title role), and then it was presented by the Deutsche Oper Berlin in 2011, with Alberto Zedda conducting. Barcellona sang Tancredi again in a new staging of the opera at the Teatro Regio di Torino in November 2009 after reprising the part in February 2009 at the Teatro de la Maestranza. The Theater an der Wien mounted the work for the first time in October 2009 with Vivica Genaux in the title role and Ren\u00e9 Jacobs conducting.\nTancredi was presented in concert by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris in December 2009 with Nora Gubisch as Tancredi.  In addition, as part of its Rossini revivals series, it presented a fully staged production in May 2014 with Marie-Nicole Lemieux in the title role and Patrizia Ciofi as Amenaide.  The production used the \"unhappy\" Ferrara ending, but incorporated many of the changes and reversions found in the December 1813 version for Milan.In 2018 Teatro Nuovo presented alternating performances of the original Venetian score (including the portions that have been replaced in most modern productions) and a version they called Tancredi rifatto, incorporating every known substitute piece by Rossini (including the aria written to replace \"Di tanti palpiti\").", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41176", "text": "By the time he was twenty years old, Rossini's reputation had grown such that  he was regarded as \"'a maestro di cartello', a composer whose name alone guarantees a public\". Success with La pietra del paragone for Milan in September was great, but delays caused him to be late in Venice for his next commission at the Teatro San Mois\u00e8, L'occasione fa il ladro. Other comedies had preceded L'occasione, but its success ensured a fifth opera for that house. This was Il Signor Bruschino, which was presented on 27 January 1813 and which the composer wrote more-or-less parallel to preparing Tancredi, a commission for this opera having been accepted from Venice's most prestigious house, La Fenice, the previous autumn.\nOther treatments of the Tancredi story had been prepared, the most recent being that of Stefano Pavesi in 1812. However, many of Rossini's formal inventions, seen in his earlier one-act operas, are here incorporated with great effect and formalism.

Noer, produced by G. Dwipayana, and starring Amoroso Katamsi, Umar Kayam, and Syubah Asa. Produced over a period of two years with a budget of Rp. 800 million, the film was sponsored by Suharto's New Order government. It was based on an official history of the 30 September Movement (Gerakan 30 September, or G30S) coup in 1965 written by Nugroho Notosusanto and Ismail Saleh, which depicted the coup as being orchestrated by the Communist Party of Indonesia (Partai Komunis Indonesia, or PKI).\nThe film depicts the period leading up to the coup and several days after it. In a time of economic turmoil, six generals are kidnapped and killed by the PKI and Air Force, purportedly to pre-empt a coup against President Sukarno. General Suharto destroys the coup and, afterwards urges the Indonesian populace to commemorate those killed and fight against all forms of communism. The film shows the G30S leadership as ruthless and planning \"every move to the last detail\", taking joy in using excessive violence and torturing the generals, depictions which have been read as portraying \"the state's enemies as outside the realm of the human\".The first commercially released domestic feature film to deal with the events of 1965, Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI was a commercial and critical success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival, winning one, and reached record viewership numbers \u2013 although in many cases audiences were required to see the film. The film was used as a propaganda vehicle by the New Order government until its collapse; televised annually on 30 September and became mandatory viewing for students.

The player's company and the individual stations each have ratings that depend largely on their efficiency at moving goods from one stations to the other. A station with high ratings may attract more goods.\nThe game begins in 1930, and ends in 2030. The player starts out by borrowing money to finance construction of transport facilities, and is charged interest until the loan is repaid.  As the user plays the game and earns revenues, they have the choice of expanding service along existing routes, or expanding their transportation network.  The game features a progression of technology: in any particular year of the game generally only contemporary types of technology are available.  For example, railroad signals which allow more than one train to use a section of track are initially semaphores. Later, they are replaced by red and green traffic-light signals. Similarly, in the beginning there are only steam engines, but later diesel and electric engines are introduced.  In the game year 1999, monorails become available.  These require a separate track system from railroads.  If the player remains in business until 2030, the game announces that they have won, allows them to post their name on the \"hall of fame\" and then continues.

Towns and cities have their own road networks, but extra roads may be needed to connect them to other towns, or to various resources.\n\nThe player earns revenue by picking up resources or passengers at a certain station, and delivering them to another station where there is a demand for them.  Demand is determined by the area which surrounds the station; for example stations close to towns will demand passengers.  The revenues will depend on the delivery time, distance, and quantity delivered.  The influence of these factors on revenue varies according to the type of goods being delivered. For example, mail will rapidly fall in value, meaning that it can only be delivered profitably over short distances, or over long distances very fast.  On the other hand, coal loses value very slowly, so it can be transported in bulk over long distances whilst remaining profitable.\nAt times, subsidies are offered to the first company to move a particular resource from one place to another.

Harrison wrote the song as a sequel to his popular Beatles composition \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", in response to the personal criticism he had received during and after his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar, particularly from Rolling Stone magazine. An edit of \"This Guitar\" was issued as a single in December 1975, as the final release by Apple Records in its original incarnation. The single failed to chart in either the United States or Britain.\nThe song follows in a tradition established by singers such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, of attributing emotions and actions to a musical instrument. The lyrics also serve as an example of a dialogue that was commonplace during the 1970s between songwriters and music critics. Contributing to Harrison's sense of injustice in \"This Guitar\", he and his tour musicians believed that detractors had ignored the successful aspects of the 1974 shows \u2013 which blended rock, jazz, funk and Indian classical music \u2013 and had focused instead on his failure to pay due respect to the legacy of the Beatles. Rolling Stone's scathing assessment of Harrison's tour and accompanying album, Dark Horse, represented an about-face by the publication, previously one of his most vocal supporters, and led to Harrison's continued resentment towards the magazine over subsequent decades.\nHarrison recorded \"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\" in Los Angeles during April and May 1975, a period marked by his post-tour despondency. The recording features guitar solos played by Harrison and American musician Jesse Ed Davis. The song serves as a rare guitar-oriented selection on the keyboard-heavy Extra Texture album, although David Foster, Gary Wright and Harrison all contributed keyboard parts to the track. \"This Guitar\" has traditionally received a mixed reception from reviewers, partly due to the inevitable comparisons with \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". Harrison re-recorded the song in 1992 with former Eurythmic Dave Stewart, who used it to promote his Platinum Weird project in 2006.

Of the critical reception given to the Harrison\u2013Shankar venture, tour-wide, Rodriguez writes of the \"genuine highlights that went mostly unreported\", since: \"Smaller press outlets without axes to grind tended to review the shows the best, whereas rock establishment coverage, such as Rolling Stone's, tended to spin the tour as something close to an unmitigated disaster ...\"\n\nAlong with Harrison and band leader Tom Scott, tour musicians Jim Horn, Jim Keltner and Andy Newmark have each challenged the reliability of these negative reports, Horn declaring the Harrison\u2013Shankar tour \"one of the best I've been on\".

Frowning on the interchangeable qualities of American cities, he wrote: \"it would not be possible to write a novel which would in every line be equally true to Munich and Florence.\"While conducting research for Babbitt, Lewis kept detailed journals, in which he drafted long biographies for each of his characters. For his title character this biography even included a detailed genealogy, as well as a list of Babbitt's college courses. Zenith's major names and families are documented in these journals, and many of them emerge again in Lewis's later writings. Zenith's layout is also imagined in careful detail. Lewis drew a series of 18 maps of Zenith and outlying areas, including Babbitt's house, with all its furnishings.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The band scored a hit in the United States from the album The Madding Crowd, with the single \"Absolutely (Story of a Girl)\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_41385", "text": "Prior to creating the group, John Hampson and Brian Desveaux played in a heavy metal band, and were also members of a cover band with drummer Vincent Tattanelli called Wonderama. In 1993, the duo took time off from those bands and began writing more poppy songs, with a focus on strong songwriting: \"If the song didn't work on acoustic guitar, then it wasn't a good song,\" said Desveaux. The band's influences were Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young. They joined with bassist Nick Dimichino and recorded eight songs with a studio drummer. Tattanelli joined the new project and the band gained Jeremy Dean as keyboardist. They recorded their debut album, Something to Listen To (1995) in nine days, which they used as their band name. The group, from St. James, began playing weekly at the Village Pub, which was regularly frequented by Midshipman from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, in Port Jefferson, New York. They released their second album Monday Songs in 1996, and won several local radio contests.After recording their third effort, 1998's Three, the band contacted producer Pat Thrall to create a four-song demo to circulate among record labels. The process was exhausting for the musicians, according to Desveaux, who estimated that they performed at showcases for each major record label and were \"passed up twice by each.\" They more frequently began performing in New York City and continued to write, with Hampson adopting an edgier songwriting style. He wrote the song \"Absolutely (Story of a Girl)\", and the band recorded a three-song demo to once again shop around to labels.

In 2000, Goldblade then recruited a new percussionist, Martin Gray, into the line up and recorded two further singles \"AC/DC\" and \"Who Was The Killa?\" together with a third album Do You Believe In The Power Of Rock 'n' Roll all released in 2002 on a new label, Twenty Stone Blatt.\nIn 2001, Jay Taylor left the band to concentrate on his Bonebox project, and two new members Johny Skullknuckles and Pete 'Gorgeous' Byrchmore (ex-Nightingales, and U.K Subs) were recruited to begin work on the next album, Rebel Songs (2004).

Production of the record was handled by NIN frontman \nTrent Reznor and English producer Flood, among other contributors.\nThe album features a heavily synth-driven electronic sound blended with industrial and rock elements. Much like the band's later work, the album's lyrics contain themes of angst, betrayal, and lovesickness. The record was promoted with the singles \"Down in It\", \"Head Like a Hole\", and \"Sin\", as well as the accompanying tour. A remastered edition was released in 2010.\nAlthough the record was successful, reaching No. 75 in the US and receiving highly favorable reviews from critics, Reznor (the band's only official member until 2016) feuded with TVT over promotion of the album, which led him to eventually sign with Interscope Records. Pretty Hate Machine was later certified triple-platinum by RIAA, becoming one of the first independently released albums to do so, and was included on several lists of the best releases of the 1980s.

Reznor mainly used an E-mu Emax, Prophet VS, Oberheim Xpander, and Minimoog as synthesizers.With the help of manager John Malm Jr., he sent the demo to various record labels. Reznor received contract offers from many of the labels, but eventually signed with TVT Records, who were known mainly for releasing novelty and television jingle records. Pretty Hate Machine was recorded in various studios with Reznor collaborating with some of his most idolized producers: Flood, Keith LeBlanc, Adrian Sherwood, and John Fryer. Much like his recorded demo, Reznor refused to record the album with a conventional band, recording Pretty Hate Machine mostly by himself.\n\"A lot of it sounds immature to me now,\" he stated in 1991 of the recordings that were then two years old. \"At first it totally sucked.

The singer began recording the album in 2007 in Anguilla, after writing and composing most of its material during and after her 2006 Adventures of Mimi Tour. Carey worked with various songwriters and producers on the project, including Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, Stargate, The-Dream, Tricky Stewart, Scott Storch and Danja.\nThe album revealed a more personal side of the singer, illustrated in its declarative theme of emancipation from her previous marriage, and from her personal and professional setbacks. It was meant to be a continuation, or a second part of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Although it shared similar vocal production as well as an inclination to her signature pop and R&B ballads, the album also encompassed a variety of dance-oriented and uptempo styles. Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy. Though considered by critics very similar to the formula its predecessor had been built on, E=MC\u00b2 included other genres she had never explored, such as reggae, and her continued recording of gospel-influenced hymns.\nE=MC\u00b2 was generally well received by music critics, with many complimenting the record's broad genre influences, and musical and production styles. Some critics, however, felt that the album was too similar to The Emancipation of Mimi. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with opening week sales of 463,000 copies; the highest first-week sales of Carey's career. It also debuted at number one in Canada, and opened inside the top-five in Australia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album has sold over 2.5 million copies.\nFour singles were released to promote the album. The album's lead single, \"Touch My Body\", became Carey's eighteenth chart-topper on the Billboard Hot 100, tying her with Elvis Presley as the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, a record she has since surpassed. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the chart, tying Presley for most weeks at number one. It achieved strong worldwide charting, peaking within the top five of the singles charts in Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \"Bye Bye\" served as the album's second release. Although hailed by critics, and expected to have achieved large commercial success, the song stalled at number nineteen on the Hot 100, and managed to chart weakly internationally.

Songs from his 2002 CD release, Earthbound, were played on the syndicated radio program Echoes. In 2006, he released the all acoustic 12 song Catapult album with his tribute to the BBC series of the same name Monarch of the Glen.

His national victory was somewhat unexpected because most observers saw popular folk singer Lepa Brena, a regional representative of Vojvodina (TV Novi Sad), as a clear favourite.Daniel achieved 4th place in Munich, equaling at the time the best ever Yugoslav placing in the Eurovision Song Contest (Lola Novakovi\u0107's 4th-place finish in 1962). \"D\u017euli\" was also a huge hit in Yugoslavia: the album sold 717,166 copies while the single sold a further 80,883. The song was a big hit in many other European countries as well, including Norway, where Daniel played several venues.Like many other Eurovision contestants, Daniel failed to build on his triumph, and his commercial appeal gradually declined. By the 1990s, his popularity was already on the wane, though he managed to register one more moderate hit in 1991 \u2013 a track called \"Daj obuci levisice\" (Please Put On Levi's) that he competed with in Jugovizija 1991 representing Croatia (HTV) and placing second, only two points behind the winning song \"Brazil\" by Bebi Dol. A few years earlier, he had also featured in Lepa Brena's folk hit \"Jugoslovenka\" (Yugoslav Girl).He stayed in Croatia during the Yugoslav Wars and disappeared into anonymity after a few unsuccessful albums. Tapping into his savings, he opened a studio and started producing records for performers like Nives Celzijus. Many artists had contacted Daniel for his services following the hit success of the song Good Boy by Minea performed on Croatian Eurovision in 1995, which Daniel composed. He would foray back into singing only occasionally. During the summer of 2001, he took part in the Sun\u010dane Skale festival in Herceg Novi.In early 2005, after an extended commercially barren period in Croatia, Daniel moved back to Montenegro, hoping to resurrect his stuttering singing career.

The collection, which consisted of all the winners as well as a few of the most favourite non-winning contestants, was entitled Congratulations (1956-1980) and Congratulations (1981-2005).In January 2007, it was reported that Daniel would take part in the Croatian pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, Dora, together with his son Sebastian (20) and daughter Isabella (16), as well as Snje\u017eana Ivana Pandl (17).

His national victory was somewhat unexpected because most observers saw popular folk singer Lepa Brena, a regional representative of Vojvodina (TV Novi Sad), as a clear favourite.Daniel achieved 4th place in Munich, equaling at the time the best ever Yugoslav placing in the Eurovision Song Contest (Lola Novakovi\u0107's 4th-place finish in 1962). \"D\u017euli\" was also a huge hit in Yugoslavia: the album sold 717,166 copies while the single sold a further 80,883. The song was a big hit in many other European countries as well, including Norway, where Daniel played several venues.Like many other Eurovision contestants, Daniel failed to build on his triumph, and his commercial appeal gradually declined. By the 1990s, his popularity was already on the wane, though he managed to register one more moderate hit in 1991 \u2013 a track called \"Daj obuci levisice\" (Please Put On Levi's) that he competed with in Jugovizija 1991 representing Croatia (HTV) and placing second, only two points behind the winning song \"Brazil\" by Bebi Dol. A few years earlier, he had also featured in Lepa Brena's folk hit \"Jugoslovenka\" (Yugoslav Girl).He stayed in Croatia during the Yugoslav Wars and disappeared into anonymity after a few unsuccessful albums. Tapping into his savings, he opened a studio and started producing records for performers like Nives Celzijus. Many artists had contacted Daniel for his services following the hit success of the song Good Boy by Minea performed on Croatian Eurovision in 1995, which Daniel composed. He would foray back into singing only occasionally. During the summer of 2001, he took part in the Sun\u010dane Skale festival in Herceg Novi.In early 2005, after an extended commercially barren period in Croatia, Daniel moved back to Montenegro, hoping to resurrect his stuttering singing career. In late 2005, his performance in Munich in 1983 was included in a collection of two double DVDs and two double CDs celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest. The collection, which consisted of all the winners as well as a few of the most favourite non-winning contestants, was entitled Congratulations (1956-1980) and Congratulations (1981-2005).In January 2007, it was reported that Daniel would take part in the Croatian pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, Dora, together with his son Sebastian (20) and daughter Isabella (16), as well as Snje\u017eana Ivana Pandl (17).

But when she rushes to tell him, she finds that he has committed suicide by hanging himself with an Internet cable.\nMattie and her friends begin to receive online messages from Josh asking for help, but assume that Josh's computer is still on and that a virus is creating the messages. Mattie learns that Josh's computer has been sold to Dex McCarthy, who finds a number of strange videos on the computer. Mattie receives a package that Josh mailed two days prior to his death. Inside are rolls of red tape and a message telling her that the tape keeps \"them\" out, although he does not know why. Later, Dex visits Mattie and shows her video messages that Josh was sending to Ziegler. Josh had hacked Ziegler's computer system and then distributed a virus. This virus had unlocked a portal that connected the realm of the living to the realm of the dead. Josh believed that he had coded a counter to the virus and wanted to meet Ziegler at the library. Josh's counter-program is found on a memory stick taped inside the PC case with red tape.\nDex and Mattie visit Ziegler and find his room entirely plastered in red tape. They believe that the red tape keeps the spirits out. Ziegler tells them of a project he worked on where he found \"frequencies no one knew existed\". Opening these frequencies somehow allowed the spirits to travel to the world of the living. Ziegler also tells them that these spirits \"take away your will to live\" and where to find the main server infected with the virus.\nDex and Mattie find the server and upload Josh's fix, causing the system to crash and the spirits to vanish. Moments later, however, the system reboots and the spirits return, leaving Mattie and Dex with no option but to flee the city by car. Over the car radio, Mattie and Dex hear a report from the Army announcing the location of several \"safe zones\" where there are no Internet connections, cell phones, or televisions. As Dex and Mattie are driving to a safe zone, a voice-over from Mattie is heard saying \"We can never go back. The cities are theirs. Our lives are different now. What was meant to connect us to one another instead connected us to forces that we could have never imagined. The world we knew is gone, but the will to live never dies. Not for us, and not for them\".

He is considered the most important Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His paintings, drawings, and engravings reflected contemporary historical upheavals and influenced important 19th- and 20th-century painters. Goya is often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns.Goya was born to a middle-class family in 1746, in Fuendetodos in Aragon. He studied painting from age 14 under Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n y Martinez and moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs. He married Josefa Bayeu in 1773. Goya became a court painter to the Spanish Crown in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and Rococo-style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace.\nAlthough Goya's letters and writings survive, little is known about his thoughts. He had a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 that left him deaf, after which his work became progressively darker and pessimistic. His later easel and mural paintings, prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social and political levels, and contrast with his social climbing. He was appointed Director of the Royal Academy in 1795, the year Manuel Godoy made an unfavorable treaty with France. In 1799, Goya became Primer Pintor de C\u00e1mara (Prime Court Painter), the highest rank for a Spanish court painter. In the late 1790s, commissioned by Godoy, he completed his La maja desnuda, a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. In 1800\u201301, he painted Charles IV of Spain and His Family, also influenced by Vel\u00e1zquez.\nIn 1807, Napoleon led the French army into the Peninsular War against Spain. Goya remained in Madrid during the war, which seems to have affected him deeply. Although he did not speak his thoughts in public, they can be inferred from his Disasters of War series of prints (although published 35 years after his death) and his 1814 paintings The Second of May 1808 and The Third of May 1808. Other works from his mid-period include the Caprichos and Los Disparates etching series, and a wide variety of paintings concerned with insanity, mental asylums, witches, fantastical creatures and religious and political corruption, all of which suggest that he feared for both his country's fate and his own mental and physical health.\nHis late period culminates with the Black Paintings of 1819\u20131823, applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the Quinta del Sordo (House of the Deaf Man) where, disillusioned by political and social developments in Spain, he lived in near isolation. Goya eventually abandoned Spain in 1824 to retire to the French city of Bordeaux, accompanied by his much younger maid and companion, Leocadia Weiss, who may have been his lover. There he completed his La Tauromaquia series and a number of other works. Following a stroke that left him paralyzed on his right side, Goya died and was buried on 16 April 1828 aged 82.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_41696", "text": "Francisco de Goya was born in Fuendetodos, Arag\u00f3n, Spain, on 30 March 1746 to Jos\u00e9 Benito de Goya y Franque and Gracia de Lucientes y Salvador. The family had moved that year from the city of Zaragoza, but there is no record why; likely Jos\u00e9 was commissioned to work there. They were lower middle-class. Jos\u00e9 was the son of a notary and of Basque origin, his ancestors being from Zerain, earning his living as a gilder, specialising in religious and decorative craftwork. He oversaw the gilding and most of the ornamentation during the rebuilding of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar (Santa Maria del Pilar), the principal cathedral of Zaragoza. Francisco was their fourth child, following his sister Rita (b. 1737), brother Tom\u00e1s (b. 1739) (who was to follow in his father's trade) and second sister Jacinta (b. 1743). There were two younger sons, Mariano (b. 1750) and Camilo (b. 1753).His mother's family had pretensions of nobility and the house, a modest brick cottage, was owned by her family and, perhaps fancifully, bore their crest. About 1749 Jos\u00e9 and Gracia bought a home in Zaragoza and were able to return to live in the city. Although there are no surviving records, it is thought that Goya may have attended the Escuelas P\u00edas de San Ant\u00f3n, which offered free schooling. His education seems to have been adequate but not enlightening; he had reading, writing and numeracy, and some knowledge of the classics. According to Robert Hughes the artist \"seems to have taken no more interest than a carpenter in philosophical or theological matters, and his views on painting ... were very down to earth: Goya was no theoretician.\" At school he formed a close and lifelong friendship with fellow pupil Mart\u00edn Zapater; the 131 letters Goya wrote to him from 1775 until Zapater's death in 1803 give valuable insight into Goya's early years at the court in Madrid.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41697", "text": "At age 14 Goya studied under the painter Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n, where he copied stamps for 4 years until he decided to work on his own, as he wrote later on \"paint from my invention\". He moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs, a popular painter with Spanish royalty. He clashed with his master, and his examinations were unsatisfactory. Goya submitted entries for the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1763 and 1766 but was denied entrance into the academia.Rome was then the cultural capital of Europe and held all the prototypes of classical antiquity, while Spain lacked a coherent artistic direction, with all of its significant visual achievements in the past. Having failed to earn a scholarship, Goya relocated at his own expense to Rome in the old tradition of European artists stretching back at least to Albrecht D\u00fcrer. He was an unknown at the time and so the records are scant and uncertain. Early biographers have him travelling to Rome with a gang of bullfighters, where he worked as a street acrobat, or for a Russian diplomat, or fell in love with a beautiful young nun whom he plotted to abduct from her convent. It is possible that Goya completed two surviving mythological paintings during the visit, a Sacrifice to Vesta and a Sacrifice to Pan, both dated 1771.\nIn 1771 he won second prize in a painting competition organized by the City of Parma. That year he returned to Zaragoza and painted elements of the cupolas of the Basilica of the Pillar (including Adoration of the Name of God), a cycle of frescoes for the monastic church of the Charterhouse of Aula Dei, and the frescoes of the Sobradiel Palace. He studied with the Aragonese artist Francisco Bayeu y Sub\u00edas and his painting began to show signs of the delicate tonalities for which he became famous. He befriended Francisco Bayeu and married his sister Josefa (he nicknamed her \"Pepa\") on 25 July 1773. Their first child, Antonio Juan Ramon Carlos, was born on 29 August 1774.

According to Robert Hughes the artist \"seems to have taken no more interest than a carpenter in philosophical or theological matters, and his views on painting ... were very down to earth: Goya was no theoretician.\" At school he formed a close and lifelong friendship with fellow pupil Mart\u00edn Zapater; the 131 letters Goya wrote to him from 1775 until Zapater's death in 1803 give valuable insight into Goya's early years at the court in Madrid.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41697", "text": "At age 14 Goya studied under the painter Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n, where he copied stamps for 4 years until he decided to work on his own, as he wrote later on \"paint from my invention\". He moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs, a popular painter with Spanish royalty. He clashed with his master, and his examinations were unsatisfactory. Goya submitted entries for the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1763 and 1766 but was denied entrance into the academia.Rome was then the cultural capital of Europe and held all the prototypes of classical antiquity, while Spain lacked a coherent artistic direction, with all of its significant visual achievements in the past. Having failed to earn a scholarship, Goya relocated at his own expense to Rome in the old tradition of European artists stretching back at least to Albrecht D\u00fcrer. He was an unknown at the time and so the records are scant and uncertain. Early biographers have him travelling to Rome with a gang of bullfighters, where he worked as a street acrobat, or for a Russian diplomat, or fell in love with a beautiful young nun whom he plotted to abduct from her convent. It is possible that Goya completed two surviving mythological paintings during the visit, a Sacrifice to Vesta and a Sacrifice to Pan, both dated 1771.\nIn 1771 he won second prize in a painting competition organized by the City of Parma. That year he returned to Zaragoza and painted elements of the cupolas of the Basilica of the Pillar (including Adoration of the Name of God), a cycle of frescoes for the monastic church of the Charterhouse of Aula Dei, and the frescoes of the Sobradiel Palace. He studied with the Aragonese artist Francisco Bayeu y Sub\u00edas and his painting began to show signs of the delicate tonalities for which he became famous. He befriended Francisco Bayeu and married his sister Josefa (he nicknamed her \"Pepa\") on 25 July 1773. Their first child, Antonio Juan Ramon Carlos, was born on 29 August 1774. Of their seven children only one, a son named Javier, survived into adulthood.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They have adopted various musical styles throughout their history. Beginning as an acoustic folk group mainly performing rearranged traditional Irish songs in Irish, they expanded their sound with original songs in English, vocal harmonies, electronic keyboards, and elements of rock, Celtic, new age, smooth jazz, and Gregorian chant.Initially known as Clann as Dobhar ('Family from Dore'), they shortened their name to Clannad in 1973. By 1979 they had released three albums and toured Europe and the US. From 1980 to 1982 they operated as a six-piece with their sister and niece Eithne (Enya). In 1982 they gained international attention with their single \"Theme from Harry's Game\". They experimented with New Age and pop-influenced sounds in the 1980s and 1990s and their music came to be defined as almost purely Celtic, making them innovators of that genre. In 1997, after 15 albums, they took a break and pursued solo projects. The band regrouped in 2007 as a four piece with Moya, Ciar\u00e1n, Noel and P\u00e1draig and completed a world tour in 2008. In 2013, P\u00f3l rejoined and they released their first studio album in fifteen years. P\u00e1draig Duggan died in 2016 and the group embarked on their farewell tour in 2020 as a quartet.Clannad have won numerous awards throughout their career, including a Grammy Award, a BAFTA, an Ivor Novello Award, and a Billboard Music Award.

The game was released in North America on February 8, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 platforms. The game took advantage of online connectivity and other features of modern gaming consoles. A single player iOS port was released about two months later, but was later pulled in anticipation of a more robust client based on the Facebook version of the game.\nThe game is structured around a fictional game show emceed by Cookie Masterson (voiced by Tom Gottlieb), in which the players answer ten multiple-choice questions, and then compete in a final \"Jack Attack\" round. Answering quickly and correctly earns virtual money to track the players' scores, while incorrect answers are penalized. As per the game's motto, \"the irreverent trivia party game\", the questions often combine general knowledge with popular culture references and verbal wordplay to determine the correct answer. Unlike the earlier releases which randomly presented questions, the 2011 game provides more than 73 episodes (with the DS version only having the first 37) with a predefined set of questions, and with further episodes to be made available as DLC, only available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 through both consoles' respective online stores.\nThe game, on consoles, supports both offline and online play (with the exception of the Wii which lacks online multiplayer) with up to four players, while the Microsoft Windows and Nintendo DS versions only support two local players and lack features such as online play and access to download various DLC Packs.

If a player is correct, they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by how quickly they answered, while if they miss the question, they lose a similar amount of money. Failing to answer does not affect a player's score.\nEach player in multiplayer games is also given a single opportunity to \"screw\" another player, forcing them to answer the question in a much shorter time period. If the selected player answers incorrectly or fails to answer the question, they lose money which is gained by the player using the screw. However, if the selected player answers correctly, they gain additional money taken from the player using the screw.\n\nThe game's trivia is based on general knowledge from several fields including science, history, and geography, combined with contemporary entertainment, celebrities, and other news items; the game, as well as the series, is often described as \"high culture meets pop culture\". For example, one question asks the players to identify which Jennifer Aniston film title would most likely have been suited for a hypothetical romantic comedy penned by Albert Einstein about the interactions between neutrons and electrons, the answer being \"He's Just Not That Into You\". In addition to the usual questions, each episode typically features a \"DisOrDat\" question. This question gives the players seven words or phrases which they have to identify as one of two possible classifications, or in some cases, both. For example, one DisOrDat series asks the players to identify terms that would be features of a Nexus One phone, Nexxus shampoo, or both. In offline play, only one player plays, while other players try to steal money by getting the answer right if the main player gets it wrong. In online play, all players play the DisOrDat simultaneously. Players are also urged to look for the \"Wrong Answer of the Game\", which is hinted at by the show's sponsor; for example, in an episode sponsored by a baby crib company, the answer \"Cat's Cradle\" is the Wrong Answer of the Game. Choosing the correct Wrong Answer does not penalize the player but instead rewards them with a large monetary bonus. Other questions are presented in the standard multiple choice format but use recurring concepts, such as questions based on a fortune cookie message, ones about a dream Cookie had based on a movie, or ones read through Cookie's ventriloquist dummy incorporating a speech impediment that may make the question harder to understand.After ten questions are completed, the final round of the game is always the \"Jack Attack\" where all players compete against each other. Prior to the round, a brief clue is shown to the players to describe a relationship that they must match, for example \"BFF\" (Best friends forever). The game then shows one word or phrase, and then cycles through other phrases which the players must match. If players respond to the wrong phrase, they lose money; only the first player to buzz in at the correct time wins and earns money.

Though Jellyvision offered some web-based You Don't Know Jack games in the interim years, the developers left the gaming market after seeing the rise of home gaming consoles in the early 2000s.

At the same time, with more information and entertainment available, the writers had to be selective about what parts of culture would remain relevant; an example given by Heinrich was that while questions about Seinfeld were okay, questions about Mad About You were not. Jellyvision Games sought comedy writers, including from local comedy clubs such as Second City and I.O., narrowing down the pool of applicants from hundreds to six, including Second City comedian Tim Sniffen, who had worked on previous iterations of the You Don't Know Jack series. A weekly training process was employed to bring the new writers up to speed and review previously written dialog for possible improvements. Heinrich also assured that material was not repeated throughout the game's script. Heinrich estimates that each question in the game was a result of about two hours of work.The majority of the game's dialogue is provided by Harry Gottlieb's brother Tom, who had voiced the emcee \"Cookie\" Masterson in the earlier games, and had been considered one of the more popular emcees by players.

It was released on June 26, 1975, by Columbia Records. Two-thirds of the album's 24 tracks feature Dylan on lead vocals backed by the Band, and were recorded in 1967, eight years before the album's release, in the lapse between the release of Blonde on Blonde and the subsequent recording and release of John Wesley Harding, during sessions that began at Dylan's house in Woodstock, New York, then moved to the basement of Big Pink. While most of these had appeared on bootleg albums, The Basement Tapes marked their first official release. The remaining eight songs, all previously unavailable, feature the Band without Dylan and were recorded between 1967 and 1975.\nDuring his 1965\u20131966 world tour, Dylan was backed by the Hawks, a five-member rock group who would later become famous as the Band. After Dylan was injured in a motorcycle accident in July 1966, four members of the Hawks came to Dylan's home in the Woodstock area to collaborate with him on music and film projects. While Dylan was out of the public's eye during an extended period of recovery in 1967, he and the members of the Hawks recorded more than 100 tracks together, incorporating original compositions, contemporary covers, and traditional material. Dylan's new style of writing moved away from the urban sensibility and extended narratives that had characterized his most recent albums, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, toward songs that were more intimate and which drew on many styles of traditional American music. While some of the basement songs are humorous, others dwell on nothingness, betrayal and a quest for salvation. In general, they possess a rootsy quality anticipating the Americana genre. For some critics, the songs on The Basement Tapes, which circulated widely in unofficial form, mounted a major stylistic challenge to rock music in the late sixties.\nWhen Columbia Records prepared the album for official release in 1975, eight songs recorded solely by the Band\u2014in various locations between 1967 and 1975\u2014were added to 16 songs taped by Dylan and the Band in 1967. Overdubs were added in 1975 to songs from both categories. The Basement Tapes was critically acclaimed upon release, reaching number seven on the Billboard Top LPs & Tape album chart.

The story of the game follows Joanna Dark, a bounty hunter working with her father and a computer hacker, as she joins the Carrington Institute agency to prevent a rival corporation from gaining possession of an ancient artefact which endows individuals with superhuman powers.\nPerfect Dark Zero features a campaign mode consisting of 14 missions that can be played solo or co-operatively, and a multiplayer mode where a maximum of 32 players can compete against each other in numerous types of deathmatch and objective-based games. Both the co-operative and multiplayer modes support split screen, system link, and the Xbox Live online service. The game was under development for five years and was originally intended to be released for the GameCube and later the Xbox. During development, several intended features were canceled so that the game could meet the Xbox 360 launch.\nUpon release, Perfect Dark Zero sold more than one million copies worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its graphics and numerous multiplayer modes. However, some critics felt that the game did not meet expectations, criticising single-player aspects such as its story and voice acting.

It shows how the Greek gods interacted with the characters and influenced their decisions pertaining to events and disputes. The only extant example of an ancient Greek theatre trilogy, the Oresteia won first prize at the Dionysia festival in 458 BCE. The principal themes of the trilogy include the contrast between revenge and justice, as well as the transition from personal vendetta to organized litigation.Oresteia originally included a satyr play, Proteus (\u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), following the tragic trilogy, but all except a single line of Proteus has been lost.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_41880", "text": "Agamemnon (\u1f08\u03b3\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bc\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd, Agam\u00e9mn\u014dn) is the first of the three plays within the Oresteia trilogy.

Waiting at home for Agamemnon is his wife, Queen Clytemnestra, who has been planning his murder. She desires his death to avenge the sacrifice of her daughter Iphigenia, to exterminate the only thing hindering her from commandeering the crown, and to finally be able to publicly embrace her long-time lover Aegisthus.The play opens to a watchman looking down and over the sea, reporting that he has been lying restless \"like a dog\" for a year, waiting to see some sort of signal confirming a Greek victory in Troy. He laments the fortunes of the house, but promises to keep silent: \"A huge ox has stepped onto my tongue.\" The watchman sees a light far off in the distance\u2014a bonfire signaling Troy's fall\u2014and is overjoyed at the victory and hopes for the hasty return of his King, as the house has \"wallowed\" in his absence.

{"id": "136_789", "question": "What type of music does Butterfly play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_41895", "text": "Butterfly is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey, released on September 10, 1997, by Columbia Records. The album contains both hip-hop and urban adult contemporary sounds, as well as some softer and more contemporary melodies. Throughout the project, Carey worked with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she had written and produced most of the material from her previous albums. She also worked with many famed hip-hop producers and rappers, such as Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, Q-Tip, Missy Elliott and the Trackmasters. With the latter acts producing most of the album, Butterfly deviated from the adult contemporary sound of Carey's previous albums.\nWith Butterfly, Carey continued the transition that began with previous album, Daydream (1995), which pushed her further into the R&B and hip hop market and away from the pop background of her previous work. Carey was able to reflect her creative maturity and evolution in the album's writing and recording. Carey writes in the booklet of her twelfth studio album, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel (2009), that she considers Butterfly her magnum opus and a turning point in both her life and career. \nFive singles were released from the album; two worldwide commercial singles and three limited-release singles. \"Honey\", the album's lead single, topped the charts in Canada and the United States, and reached the top five in New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. The album's fifth and final single, \"My All\", became a top-ten hit throughout Europe and topped the charts in the United States. To promote the album, Carey embarked on the Butterfly World Tour, which visited Australia, Japan and Taiwan, with one show in the United States. Butterfly was nominated for three Grammy Awards at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards.\nButterfly received acclaim from music critics, many of whom embraced Carey's musical transition. Reviewers complimented the album for its mature sound and production, as well as Carey's musical direction. Though released during Carey's heavily publicized conflict with Sony Music, the album became an international commercial success, topping the albums charts in many countries, including Australia, Canada, Greece, Japan, the Netherlands, as well as the United States. It was certified five-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States and received the Million Award in Japan. Globally, Butterfly has sold over ten million copies.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_41896", "text": "Carey began working on Butterfly in January 1997. During the album's development in mid-1997 Carey separated from her husband, music executive Tommy Mottola, who had guided her career since 1990. Carey's increasing control over her own career had led to speculation in the press over the future of the couple, and they later divorced. Throughout the development of the album, in a departure from her previous style, Carey worked with various rappers and hip hop producers, including Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, Q-Tip, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters. Critics saw Carey's new production team as a form of revenge on Mottola and Sony Music. Carey denied taking a radically new direction, and insisted that the musical style of her new album was of her own choosing. Nevertheless, Carey resented the control that Sony, whose president was Mottola, exercised over her music, preventing her from making music about which she was passionate. In contrast, Sony was concerned Carey, their best-selling act, could jeopardize her future success through her actions.The pressure of the separation and constant press attention began to take its toll on Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.Butterfly was first released on September 10, 1997, in Japan and Taiwan. It was unconventionally released on Thursday, September 11, in the United Kingdom, and September 12 in the rest of Europe. Columbia released it on September 16 in the United States. It was issued as an LP, cassette, compact disc, and/or MiniDisc depending on the country. In the United States, Columbia also issued a cassette/CD package set, the first such configuration by a record label.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41897", "text": "Butterfly was described as an R&B, pop and hip hop music album with hip hop soul elements.\nWith a variety of writers and producers and its new musical direction for Carey, the album was always likely to be a commercial success. Carey and Combs wrote the lead single, \"Honey.\" Combs believed this to be a good song but was uncertain how successful it would be as a release owing to its heavy hip hop influence. The remix for \"Honey\" featured rapping lead vocals from Da Brat, The LOX and Mase, and some verses were rapped by Combs himself. The track was very different from Carey's previous recordings, and was described by author Chris Nickson as \"street Hip-Hop music, with a booming bass.\" The song's melody was driven by Q-Tip's drum programming and Stevie J's keyboard notes. Combs's production gave the song a \"light and airy\" effect, further distancing it from Carey's contemporary sound. \"Honey\" featured musical samples from Treacherous Three's \"The Body Rock\", and \"Hey DJ\" by The World's Famous Supreme Team. The track used both hip hop and R&B with traces of pop music and was described as a \"[song with a] catchy chorus, combining hip hop and pop into something that simply wasn't going to be denied by anyone, and offering a powerful start to a record.\"The album's second single, \"Butterfly\", was one of the ballads Carey wrote with Afanasieff. Carey described the song as the \"favorite ballad she had ever written\", one that was more personal than her previous work as the emotions conveyed through the song allude at just how meaningful the lyrics are to her. Carey solely wrote the lyrics while Afanasieff, who composed the music with Dan Shea, handled the song's instrumentals, and added a few personal R&B touches. Another ballad Carey wrote with Afanasieff was \"My All\", written as a contrast to the album's general hip hop flavor. Carey described the song as having \"a lush sound and intense styling\". It featured guitar arpeggios, which were synthetically created using sampling and keyboard notes. \"The Roof\", Butterfly's European single, incorporated fragments from Mobb Deep's \"Shook Ones (Part II)\", and was produced by Carey, Poke & Tone and Cory Rooney.\n\n\"Fourth of July\", one of the album's slower ballads, was also written solely by Carey and Afanasieff but was not released as a single. The song was perceived to have jazz influences and was compared to some of Carey's older work such as \"Vanishing\" and \"The Wind\". The next two tracks on the record, \"Breakdown\" and \"Babydoll\", were described as \"the album's backbone, its real declaration of independence\" by Nickson. \"Breakdown\" was written by Carey and Puffy and included rap verses from Wish and Krayzie Bone from Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Author Chris Nickson wrote that \"'Breakdown' showed Mariah treading forcefully into territory that was new for her and making it her own.\" For \"Babydoll\", Carey teamed up with Elliott. The track was recorded in Atlanta, where Elliott resided, and included background vocals from Carey's long-time friend, Trey Lorenz. \"Babydoll\" is an R&B ballad with trip hop and drum and bass influences, and was described as \"a vocally driven piece\", with strong jazz harmony provided by Cory Rooney. Other songs that incorporated R&B influence into ballads were \"Whenever You Call\" and \"Close My Eyes\", which were personally important to Carey due to their lyrical content. While both were similar ballads to Carey's previous work, Nickson said:\n\nWhile up to the standard of anything Mariah had ever done before, [they] suffered in comparison. But even here you could hear the new Mariah in the spareness of the arrangements and the way it was her voice, rather than any instrument, that controlled the song. She'd grown to the point where having less behind her really proved to be more, for the song and for her. It was notable, too, that like the other ballads on the record, these two leaned very much towards R&B.\n\nCarey wrote the song \"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\" with famed house music producer David Morales. When imagining the concept for \"Butterfly\", Carey intended the song to be a house music record, but after writing it, made it into a ballad. Carey expressed a desire to feature her concept both on the house record, in addition to the ballad that would become \"Butterfly\". Morales took Carey's lyrics, concept and melody and added a house beat to it. For the album, Carey recorded a version of Prince's \"The Beautiful Ones\", featuring Dru Hill, with Dru Hill lead singer Sisq\u00f3 sharing much of the lead with her. The song was one of the last recorded tracks and was the only non-original song on Butterfly. The final song on the album was \"Outside\", a ballad that was written by Carey, Afanasieff and Rooney, about Carey's experience being biracial. Richard Harrington from The Washington Post described the album's subtle inclusion of both pop and R&B genres:\n\nThere are two Mariah Careys on Butterfly. One is the pop-oriented, ballad-leaning traditionalist who works very effectively with her longtime professional partner, composer-producer Walter Afanasieff. The other is a self-styled hip-hop fanatic who worked with Ol' Dirty Bastard on her last album and teams up here with several of that genre's movers and shakers, most notably Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, the godfather of hip-hop soul and the hottest producer in pop music today.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41896", "text": "Carey began working on Butterfly in January 1997. During the album's development in mid-1997 Carey separated from her husband, music executive Tommy Mottola, who had guided her career since 1990. Carey's increasing control over her own career had led to speculation in the press over the future of the couple, and they later divorced. Throughout the development of the album, in a departure from her previous style, Carey worked with various rappers and hip hop producers, including Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, Q-Tip, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters. Critics saw Carey's new production team as a form of revenge on Mottola and Sony Music. Carey denied taking a radically new direction, and insisted that the musical style of her new album was of her own choosing. Nevertheless, Carey resented the control that Sony, whose president was Mottola, exercised over her music, preventing her from making music about which she was passionate. In contrast, Sony was concerned Carey, their best-selling act, could jeopardize her future success through her actions.The pressure of the separation and constant press attention began to take its toll on Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.Butterfly was first released on September 10, 1997, in Japan and Taiwan. It was unconventionally released on Thursday, September 11, in the United Kingdom, and September 12 in the rest of Europe. Columbia released it on September 16 in the United States. It was issued as an LP, cassette, compact disc, and/or MiniDisc depending on the country. In the United States, Columbia also issued a cassette/CD package set, the first such configuration by a record label.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41897", "text": "Butterfly was described as an R&B, pop and hip hop music album with hip hop soul elements.\nWith a variety of writers and producers and its new musical direction for Carey, the album was always likely to be a commercial success. Carey and Combs wrote the lead single, \"Honey.\" Combs believed this to be a good song but was uncertain how successful it would be as a release owing to its heavy hip hop influence. The remix for \"Honey\" featured rapping lead vocals from Da Brat, The LOX and Mase, and some verses were rapped by Combs himself. The track was very different from Carey's previous recordings, and was described by author Chris Nickson as \"street Hip-Hop music, with a booming bass.\" The song's melody was driven by Q-Tip's drum programming and Stevie J's keyboard notes. Combs's production gave the song a \"light and airy\" effect, further distancing it from Carey's contemporary sound. \"Honey\" featured musical samples from Treacherous Three's \"The Body Rock\", and \"Hey DJ\" by The World's Famous Supreme Team. The track used both hip hop and R&B with traces of pop music and was described as a \"[song with a] catchy chorus, combining hip hop and pop into something that simply wasn't going to be denied by anyone, and offering a powerful start to a record.\"The album's second single, \"Butterfly\", was one of the ballads Carey wrote with Afanasieff. Carey described the song as the \"favorite ballad she had ever written\", one that was more personal than her previous work as the emotions conveyed through the song allude at just how meaningful the lyrics are to her. Carey solely wrote the lyrics while Afanasieff, who composed the music with Dan Shea, handled the song's instrumentals, and added a few personal R&B touches. Another ballad Carey wrote with Afanasieff was \"My All\", written as a contrast to the album's general hip hop flavor. Carey described the song as having \"a lush sound and intense styling\". It featured guitar arpeggios, which were synthetically created using sampling and keyboard notes. \"The Roof\", Butterfly's European single, incorporated fragments from Mobb Deep's \"Shook Ones (Part II)\", and was produced by Carey, Poke & Tone and Cory Rooney.\n\n\"Fourth of July\", one of the album's slower ballads, was also written solely by Carey and Afanasieff but was not released as a single. The song was perceived to have jazz influences and was compared to some of Carey's older work such as \"Vanishing\" and \"The Wind\". The next two tracks on the record, \"Breakdown\" and \"Babydoll\", were described as \"the album's backbone, its real declaration of independence\" by Nickson. \"Breakdown\" was written by Carey and Puffy and included rap verses from Wish and Krayzie Bone from Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Author Chris Nickson wrote that \"'Breakdown' showed Mariah treading forcefully into territory that was new for her and making it her own.\" For \"Babydoll\", Carey teamed up with Elliott. The track was recorded in Atlanta, where Elliott resided, and included background vocals from Carey's long-time friend, Trey Lorenz. \"Babydoll\" is an R&B ballad with trip hop and drum and bass influences, and was described as \"a vocally driven piece\", with strong jazz harmony provided by Cory Rooney. Other songs that incorporated R&B influence into ballads were \"Whenever You Call\" and \"Close My Eyes\", which were personally important to Carey due to their lyrical content.

The band was first called Avatar, but, shortly before the release of their debut album Sirens (1983), they changed their name to Savatage, as Avatar was already taken by at least one other band. Savatage is considered to be an integral part of the American heavy metal movement of the early-to-mid-1980s and has been cited as a key influence on numerous heavy metal subgenres.Savatage has released eleven studio albums, two live albums, five compilations and three EPs. The band first reached substantial commercial success with its third studio album Fight for the Rock (1986), which peaked at number 158 on the Billboard 200. Its next four albums\u2014Hall of the Mountain King (1987), Gutter Ballet (1989), Streets: A Rock Opera (1991) and Edge of Thorns (1993)\u2014were also successful but more critically acclaimed than Fight for the Rock. On October 17, 1993, six months after the release of Edge of Thorns, guitarist Criss Oliva was killed in a car accident. Following his death, Jon (along with producer Paul O'Neill) decided to continue Savatage in memory of his brother. The band released four more studio albums, and went through several lineup changes before going on an extended hiatus in 2002. During the years\u2014partly even before the hiatus\u2014members founded various new bands such as Jon Oliva's Pain, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Circle II Circle and Doctor Butcher. On August 2, 2014, Savatage announced that they were reuniting for the 2015 Wacken Open Air; despite having discussed the possibility of more shows and new music, the band went on hiatus once again. Although the members of Savatage claimed in interviews conducted in 2020\u20132021 that they were working on new material together, a full-fledged reunion of the band was officially confirmed by Jon Oliva in April 2023, with plans to release Curtain Call, their first studio album in 23 years, in 2024 followed by a world tour.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "740_18347", "text": "Savatage and its former variations started out as a heavy metal band, incorporating Jon Oliva's powerful, sometimes screamed vocals accompanied by Criss Oliva's heavy guitar riffs and fast, melodic solos.

The film was written by Dreyer and Christen Jul based on elements from J. Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 collection of supernatural stories In a Glass Darkly. Vampyr was funded by Nicolas de Gunzburg who starred in the film under the name of Julian West among a mostly non-professional cast. Gunzburg plays the role of Allan Gray, a student of the occult who enters the village of Courtempierre, which is under the curse of a vampire.\nVampyr was challenging for Dreyer to make as it was his first sound film and was required to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with  title cards like a silent film. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The soundtrack was created in Berlin where the characters\u2019 voices, sound effects, and score were recorded.\nVampyr had a delayed release in Germany and opened to a generally negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut. The film was long considered a low point in Dreyer's career, but modern critical reception to the film has become much more favorable with critics praising the film's disorienting visual effects and atmosphere.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_41926", "text": "On a late evening, Allan Gray arrives at an inn close to the village of Courtempierre and he rents a room to sleep.

The story begins in medias res: the eponymous Lucy has come from the West Indies to the United States to be an au pair for a wealthy white family. The plot of the novel closely mirrors Kincaid's own experiences.\nLucy retains the critical tone of A Small Place but simplifies the style of Kincaid's earlier work by using less repetition and surrealism. The first of her books set completely outside the Caribbean, Lucy, like most of Kincaid's writing, has a strong autobiographical basis. The novel's protagonist, Lucy Josephine Potter, shares one of Kincaid's given names and her birthday. Like Kincaid, Lucy leaves the Caribbean to become an au pair in a large American city. At nineteen, Lucy is older than previous Kincaid protagonists, which lends the book a more mature and cynical perspective than in her previous fiction. Still, Lucy has pangs of homesickness and unresolved feelings about her mother, and she has never lived on her own or seen much of the world. With plenty of room for growth and Lucy becoming a photographer, the story takes the form of a k\u00fcnstlerroman, a novel in which an artist matures.\nLucy also joins the tradition of American immigration literature, tales that recount a newcomer's experience in the United States, such as those seen in Anzia Yezierska\u2019s Bread Givers, Willa Cather\u2019s My \u00c1ntonia, and Julia Alvarez\u2019s How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents. Along with exploring immigration, Lucy, as does much of Kincaid's work, grapples with tensions between mother and daughter. Colonial themes of identity confusion and the connection between maternal and imperial rule stand out less clearly in Lucy than in Kincaid's earlier books but have an underlying presence in Lucy's relationship with her white, affluent employers, her homeland, and her new surroundings.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_41930", "text": "Eager to leave the West Indies, Lucy longs to leave her past behind. She does not feel nostalgic for her childhood and her homeland, where she felt oppressed by toxic colonial and family influences. However, on her arrival to North America, she reflects on the differences between the place that she had previously called home and where she now lives. She feels as if something is wrong because the sun is shining but the air is still cold. Additionally, she recalls fond memories of her grandmother along with her favorite foods from home that her grandmother would cook for her, both of which are no longer available to her. She moves to America to work as an au pair for a well-off family. Although she is initially enamored with their seemingly perfect life, she grows disillusioned with their lifestyle and feels alienated from the family. Despite this, she does grow close to the mother, Mariah, who reminds Lucy of both the good and bad in her own mother. The relationship between Lucy and her mother is a central theme. At one point in her relationship with Mariah, Lucy sees Mariah (her boss) and her mother as the same, because they both try to control Lucy. (At other times, Lucy feels like Mariah's friend.) Lucy also sees a resemblance when she sees Lewis, Mariah's husband, cheats on Mariah, because Lucy's own father cheated on her mother.\nThroughout the book, Lucy's strained relationship with her mother drives her quest for independence and ability to create her own identity against that of her mother's. Lucy's mother was committed to her father, who had children by multiple other women. Angry that her mother valued proper, committed relationships (and taught Lucy to behave the same way) and still ended up hurt, Lucy attempts to identify herself against her mother through her multiple sexual encounters devoid of emotional attachment. This novel explores Lucy's sexuality as part of her identity search, illustrated through her various sexual encounters with men as well as her homoerotic relationship with her friend Peggy, whom Mariah dislikes for being a bad influence.\nLucy's father is not referred to as much as her mother is spoken about, so it is unclear what kind of relationship they have or if she feels as negatively towards him as she does towards her mother. Lucy's father was an older man when he married her mother, and she describes their arrangement as mutually beneficial. Her mother married someone who would not bother her too much, while she was still able to maintain appearances. Likewise, her father in his old age married someone in order to take care of him. Her father had several love affairs and children with other women before he married her mother. Some of these women tried to cause harm to both Lucy and her mother throughout their lives.

Their first major performance was at a benefit for Mayor John Lindsay, after which they attracted music director Bernice Cole (5 November 1921\u201319 November 2006), who had been a member of the Angelic Gospel Singers, to which she later returned.  They also gained a manager, Jerry Brandt, who had previously worked with Sam Cooke and who persuaded the ensemble to update their material and style.In January 1970, they performed at the \"Winter Festival for Peace\" at Madison Square Garden on a bill with Harry Belafonte, Richie Havens, Judy Collins, Dave Brubeck, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Rascals, Jimi Hendrix (who abandoned his performance after two numbers), and the cast of Hair.  They made regular TV appearances, and recorded an album for Elektra Records, Right On Be Free, released in 1970.  The album focused on ensemble singing in a traditional black gospel style, but with secular lyrics emphasising \"the power of the people\", and a \"soulful feel\".  Several of the tracks, including the title track \"Right On, Be Free\", were written by Chuck Griffin.  Lead vocals on Right On Be Free were by Cole, Anna Griffin, Gerri Griffin, and Cynthia Sessions.  The backing musicians included Richard Tee, Cornell Dupree, Chuck Rainey, and Ralph MacDonald, and the album was produced by David Rubinson.

Their first major performance was at a benefit for Mayor John Lindsay, after which they attracted music director Bernice Cole (5 November 1921\u201319 November 2006), who had been a member of the Angelic Gospel Singers, to which she later returned.  They also gained a manager, Jerry Brandt, who had previously worked with Sam Cooke and who persuaded the ensemble to update their material and style.In January 1970, they performed at the \"Winter Festival for Peace\" at Madison Square Garden on a bill with Harry Belafonte, Richie Havens, Judy Collins, Dave Brubeck, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Rascals, Jimi Hendrix (who abandoned his performance after two numbers), and the cast of Hair.  They made regular TV appearances, and recorded an album for Elektra Records, Right On Be Free, released in 1970.  The album focused on ensemble singing in a traditional black gospel style, but with secular lyrics emphasising \"the power of the people\", and a \"soulful feel\".  Several of the tracks, including the title track \"Right On, Be Free\", were written by Chuck Griffin.  Lead vocals on Right On Be Free were by Cole, Anna Griffin, Gerri Griffin, and Cynthia Sessions.  The backing musicians included Richard Tee, Cornell Dupree, Chuck Rainey, and Ralph MacDonald, and the album was produced by David Rubinson.  The group received a standing ovation at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival in the UK, appeared at the Apollo Theater, and performed in Ghana in February 1971 at the Soul To Soul concert. Reviewing the LP in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \"Producer-manager Jerry Brandt has done a pretty good job of recording this untransportable troupe of twenty or so black adolescents. Except for an unnecessary 'Proud Mary' and an embarrassing 'Let It Be Me' (a/k/a 'Let It Be Us'), it shouts and almost jumps, just like church, or a basketball tournament.

Eighteen months later, the same track was filmed under their own name for the prime time ABC-TV special of the project.\nSubsequently, they also performed in a concert at Sing Sing prison with B.B. King and Joan Baez. which was filmed for a documentary. The following year they moved to the Just Sunshine label owned by promoter Michael Lang, and released a third album, The Voices of East Harlem, produced by Curtis Mayfield, Leroy Hutson, and Rich Tufo.  By this time, their lead vocalists were Gerri Griffin and Monica Burruss (later to be featured in various Barry Manilow tours. Other singers included Bernard Graham, Wayne Garfield, Jerome Mack, Elaine Clark, Cynthia Sessions, Kevin Griffin and Claudia Moore.  The album yielded a minor hit single, \"Giving Love\" produced by Mayfield, which reached no.57 on the Billboard R&B chart in 1973.  The single \"Wanted Dead or Alive\" was later reissued as a 12\" remix  and the group released its final album in 1974, Can You Feel It, produced by Hutson.

Willie is a taxi driver who aspires to buy a diner, while Cy is the owner of a struggling beauty salon. They are joined on the volunteer police force by their friends Bobby, Elliot, Ken and Pete.\nThe group are eating dinner at Cy's apartment when Willie's wife Sally phones to say that their daughter Karen has been attacked in the elevator. Karen specifies that the attacker was white just as Elliot leads a black man into Willie's apartment, believing him to be the culprit. Willie lets the man go.\nThe auxiliary police force gets its uniforms and gathers for its first patrol. The unit is only authorized to report suspicious activity but cannot enforce the law; Cy suggests that the restriction be ignored. Willie finds his daughter in the street with her boyfriend, Chico, and sends her home for the night. Cy apprehends a young man for smoking marijuana in the street, but when he brings him to the station he is informed by an officer that he has no grounds for arrest. Later, Cy excitedly shows Willie his new car, which is painted to look like a police car and has a working siren. Willie expresses concern that Cy is inviting trouble.\nAt a community meeting, a psychologist named Dr. Richter conducts a lecture on rape. Using Cy's wife Irene as a volunteer from the audience, Richter poses as a rapist and recommends she embrace him rather than resist, because a fear response will only provoke the attacker. That night, Irene rouses Cy from sleep for a bedroom role-playing session with Cy pretending to be a rapist.\nCy impresses the other members of the auxiliary force by taking them for a joyride in his fake police car. They listen to a call overheard on Cy's police band radio and activate the siren to run a red light, thrilled with their newly found power.\nWillie comes home to find Karen under the influence of a drug. When confronted, Karen admits to taking a pill she received from Chico. Willie heads to the apartment of Chico's family with other members of the auxiliary force in Cy's fake police car. Willie accepts a gun from Cy but declines any further help, heading up to confront Chico himself. Willie spots Chico in the hall and chases Chico throughout the building. Meanwhile, Cy, Pete and Elliot hear a police call over the radio of an officer in trouble nearby while the car is pelted with bottles thrown from the shadows.

Willie is a taxi driver who aspires to buy a diner, while Cy is the owner of a struggling beauty salon. They are joined on the volunteer police force by their friends Bobby, Elliot, Ken and Pete.\nThe group are eating dinner at Cy's apartment when Willie's wife Sally phones to say that their daughter Karen has been attacked in the elevator. Karen specifies that the attacker was white just as Elliot leads a black man into Willie's apartment, believing him to be the culprit. Willie lets the man go.\nThe auxiliary police force gets its uniforms and gathers for its first patrol. The unit is only authorized to report suspicious activity but cannot enforce the law; Cy suggests that the restriction be ignored. Willie finds his daughter in the street with her boyfriend, Chico, and sends her home for the night. Cy apprehends a young man for smoking marijuana in the street, but when he brings him to the station he is informed by an officer that he has no grounds for arrest. Later, Cy excitedly shows Willie his new car, which is painted to look like a police car and has a working siren. Willie expresses concern that Cy is inviting trouble.\nAt a community meeting, a psychologist named Dr. Richter conducts a lecture on rape. Using Cy's wife Irene as a volunteer from the audience, Richter poses as a rapist and recommends she embrace him rather than resist, because a fear response will only provoke the attacker. That night, Irene rouses Cy from sleep for a bedroom role-playing session with Cy pretending to be a rapist.\nCy impresses the other members of the auxiliary force by taking them for a joyride in his fake police car. They listen to a call overheard on Cy's police band radio and activate the siren to run a red light, thrilled with their newly found power.\nWillie comes home to find Karen under the influence of a drug. When confronted, Karen admits to taking a pill she received from Chico. Willie heads to the apartment of Chico's family with other members of the auxiliary force in Cy's fake police car. Willie accepts a gun from Cy but declines any further help, heading up to confront Chico himself. Willie spots Chico in the hall and chases Chico throughout the building. Meanwhile, Cy, Pete and Elliot hear a police call over the radio of an officer in trouble nearby while the car is pelted with bottles thrown from the shadows. Pete and Elliot want to leave, but Cy refuses to abandon Willie. When Cy gets out of the car, he is shot. Eddie and Pete drive off in fear.

It is the first game in the Space Quest series, and sees players assume the role of a lowly janitor on a research ship, who becomes involved in stopping an alien race using a new form of technology for evil purposes.\nThe game was the first to be created by Murphy and Crowe, after working on other Sierra titles at the time such as King's Quest II. Part of their proposal included moving away from the serious, medieval settings of other titles, in favour of making a \"fun, silly game\", utilising Sierra's AGI engine. Space Quest I became an instant hit, selling in excess of 100,000 copies to begin with, and spawned several sequels, beginning with Space Quest II in 1987.\nA remake of the game by Sierra was released in 1991, featuring improved graphics and gameplay.

The player or team is given a set of tasks\u2014usually related to the story\u2014to complete somewhere in the game world; in return, they are rewarded with experience points, items, and money. Dynamic missions are similar to traditional missions in purpose, but are created at the player's request. Once they choose its difficulty and other options, the game generates a new indoor area filled with computer-controlled enemies. The player or team are told to go to its location, and finish some task inside for their reward. Dynamic missions, like many other encounters in Anarchy Online, are \"instanced\": each mission area is available only to the owners of the mission.", "hasanswer": false}]}

On meeting Anto in a bar, Git finds that the latter's gambling addiction has left him in debt to the bookies, who are about to take his fingers as collateral. Git saves his friend, but permanently disfigures the ringleader, the nephew of widely feared mob boss, Tom French.\nAt a sit-down, Tom French decrees that Git must work off Anto's debt. He is ordered to find French's associate Frank Grogan in Cork, and bring him back to Dublin. Holding Anto as a hostage, French pairs the reluctant Git with half-wit and heavy-handed mobster, Bunny Kelly.\nAfter robbing a petrol station and dumping their stolen car, Bunny and Git steal another car. They drive to a remote bog area to rendezvous with a \"Friendly Face\". However, arriving too late, they drive to Cork, but find that Grogan has left his hotel. Following a tip, they drive to The Black & Amber Inn, a pub that Grogan frequents. However, Git is attacked by mobsters who break his nose. Bunny painfully re-sets Git's nose for him. Returning to the pub, they follow the mobsters to a secluded house. Bunny and Git conclude that Frank Grogan is being held against his will and decide to rescue him.\nThe following morning, Bunny gives Git a pistol. They enter the house, find Grogan, and flee, engaging in a gunfight with the mobsters. Grogan asks where he is being taken. When informed that he is being taken to French, Grogan panics and attempts to flee. Grogan is then bundled into the boot. After phoning French's associates, Bunny and Git are informed that the \"Friendly Face\" will be at the bogs the following day, to receive Grogan. They release Grogan from the boot and head for the rendezvous. In Grogan's incessant, self-aggrandizing chatter, he claims to be having an affair with French's wife and that French only wants him for that reason. Grogan is ignored by Bunny, who then abandons the car and steals a Mercedes-Benz.\nArriving at the rendezvous, Bunny refuses to leave the car. Git and Grogan go to meet the \"Friendly Face\". Grogan, certain he will be murdered, begs Git not to leave him. Git agrees. At the rendezvous, Grogan does not recognise the man and is fearful.

Sonny came into possession of one side of a plate to print 20-dollar bills. Without the other half, it was useless. French later came into possession of the other side of the plates. Eager to get both plates, French offered Grogan \u00a35,000. Grogan refused, instead opting to sell his half for \u00a310,000 to a criminal from London. French, however, counter-offered. He had found a buyer for both plates, offering \u00a3100,000. French agreed to a 50\u201350 deal, and offered Grogan \u00a325,000 up-front. French's wife was to deliver the money, but Grogan says she never showed up.\nPhoning French, a meeting is arranged. Anto will be released and the deal closed. The trio check into a hotel. Bunny and Git tie Grogan up, so they can enjoy the swimming pool and bar. Bunny and Git both pick up women in the bar and have one-night stands with then. As they smoke during pillow-talk, Git reveals that his prison sentence was because he took the fall for the theft of a television by his elderly and drunken father. Git expresses grief that his father died right after he started his prison term and that going to gaol ruined his relationship with Sabrina. But Git expresses a desire to move on with his life without ever telling Sabrina the truth. When Bunny and Git return to the room, they find Grogan has escaped. Before leaving, Grogan made three phone calls; one to a Cork number, one to a taxi company, and one to a nearby hotel. Bunny and Git head there. Grogan has checked in under a false name, but Bunny recognises his deception. Grogan's associates from Cork arrive soon after, forcing Bunny and Git to flee again with Grogan in the boot of the car. The trio then head for the rendezvous with French. Leaving Grogan with Bunny, Git and French head into the woods to dig up a package with one of the plates. French, Git, Grogan, and Bunny then head to another area, where French instructs them to dig another area where the skeletal remains of Sonny Mulligan is uncovered.\nFrench and Grogan then reveal what really happened. During the 1970s, Mulligan had \"borrowed\" the plates from an American criminal gang, on condition that he did not print more than $50,000, which was to be his retirement money. French married Mulligan's niece (whom Grogan proceeded to have an extramarital affair with). French urged Mulligan to print more than the agreed $50,000, but Sonny refused and the two had a blazing argument at French's wedding. Grogan and French decided to steal the plates, print their own batch, and then return the plates without Mulligan ever knowing. Mulligan, however, always kept one of the plates in his possession. Grogan spied on Mulligan and saw where he had buried the other plate. But when Mulligan saw Grogan spying on him, Grogan shot him dead and took the other plate. Burying him, Grogan and French only narrowly avoided being killed by Mulligan's relatives and by the American gangsters. They told both that Mulligan stole the plates and fled Ireland with them. Soon after, French learned of Grogan's affair with his wife and the two gangsters parted for good.\nBack in the present, an outraged French demands to know where his wife is. Grogan insists that Mrs. French never met him. Realizing that French's wife has absconded with the \u00a325,000, Bunny laughs hysterically. Seething, French picks up the pistol buried with Mulligan, shoots Grogan dead, and snaps, \"That was for Sonny.\" Snarling, \"And this is for fucking my wife,\" French shoots Grogan's corpse a second time.\nFrench then shoots Bunny in the elbow before Git kills him.

She asks Git to reassure Anto that he accepts this. On meeting Anto in a bar, Git finds that the latter's gambling addiction has left him in debt to the bookies, who are about to take his fingers as collateral. Git saves his friend, but permanently disfigures the ringleader, the nephew of widely feared mob boss, Tom French.\nAt a sit-down, Tom French decrees that Git must work off Anto's debt. He is ordered to find French's associate Frank Grogan in Cork, and bring him back to Dublin. Holding Anto as a hostage, French pairs the reluctant Git with half-wit and heavy-handed mobster, Bunny Kelly.\nAfter robbing a petrol station and dumping their stolen car, Bunny and Git steal another car. They drive to a remote bog area to rendezvous with a \"Friendly Face\". However, arriving too late, they drive to Cork, but find that Grogan has left his hotel. Following a tip, they drive to The Black & Amber Inn, a pub that Grogan frequents. However, Git is attacked by mobsters who break his nose. Bunny painfully re-sets Git's nose for him. Returning to the pub, they follow the mobsters to a secluded house. Bunny and Git conclude that Frank Grogan is being held against his will and decide to rescue him.\nThe following morning, Bunny gives Git a pistol. They enter the house, find Grogan, and flee, engaging in a gunfight with the mobsters. Grogan asks where he is being taken. When informed that he is being taken to French, Grogan panics and attempts to flee. Grogan is then bundled into the boot. After phoning French's associates, Bunny and Git are informed that the \"Friendly Face\" will be at the bogs the following day, to receive Grogan. They release Grogan from the boot and head for the rendezvous. In Grogan's incessant, self-aggrandizing chatter, he claims to be having an affair with French's wife and that French only wants him for that reason. Grogan is ignored by Bunny, who then abandons the car and steals a Mercedes-Benz.\nArriving at the rendezvous, Bunny refuses to leave the car. Git and Grogan go to meet the \"Friendly Face\". Grogan, certain he will be murdered, begs Git not to leave him. Git agrees. At the rendezvous, Grogan does not recognise the man and is fearful. The \"Friendly Face\" pulls a gun and forces them to kneel. Grogan offers the \"Friendly Face\" \u00a350,000 for his own release and to kill Git.

He was best known as the lead singer, lyricist and occasional guitarist of the post-punk band Joy Division, with whom he released the albums Unknown Pleasures (1979) and Closer (1980). He was noted for his unique dancing style influenced by his experiences with epilepsy, as well as his dark baritone voice. Retrospectively viewed as \"one of the finest songwriters of his generation,\" his intensely introspective and dark lyricism has provoked \"visceral and raw emotions\" among fans. He was also noted for his distinct on-stage behaviour.\nCurtis had epilepsy and depression and died by suicide on the eve of Joy Division's first North American tour, shortly before the release of Closer. Shortly after his death, the three surviving members of the band renamed themselves New Order. Despite their short career, Joy Division have exerted a wide-reaching influence. John Bush of AllMusic argues that they \"became the first band in the post-punk movement emphasizing not anger and energy but mood and expression, pointing ahead to the rise of melancholy alternative music in the '80s\".

By passing his 11-Plus exam, sat by all primary school children, he gained a place at the age of 11 at Macclesfield's boys\u2019 grammar school The King's School.

However, \"Mainline\" broke through the group's difficulties of creating a hit dance record and has since become an internationally revered dance classic.\nAs a solo artist, Burgess had numerous club hits, beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s including \"Let's Do It\", \"Fire Night Dance\", \"Heartbreaker\", \"Stranger\" and \"You Got That Something\".

Burgess frequently collaborated with Adams in writing songs.\nThe group scored a number of R&B hits in the 1970s, including \"Don't Turn Around\" (a top 40 R&B hit released in 1969), \"You And I\", \"I'll Find a Way (The Loneliest Man in Town)\", \"Spinning Around\", \"What Goes Around (Comes Around)\" and \"Will We Ever Come Together\". Though they recorded several uptempo tracks, such as \"Big Apple Rock\", \"Walking Downtown (On a Saturday Night)\", \"What Goes Around (Comes Around)\" and, later, \"Mainline\" (written by Burgess, but recorded after he left the group), Black Ivory faced tough competition from the rise of disco, but proved unable to compete when disco became the dominant music style. However, \"Mainline\" broke through the group's difficulties of creating a hit dance record and has since become an internationally revered dance classic.\nAs a solo artist, Burgess had numerous club hits, beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s including \"Let's Do It\", \"Fire Night Dance\", \"Heartbreaker\", \"Stranger\" and \"You Got That Something\". Burgess chose to take a hiatus from Black Ivory in 1977, and developed several bands of his own, which include Convertion and LOGG, before joining twins TaharQa and TundeRa Aleem as their Lead vocalist Aleem, which had R&B songs such as \"Love's on Fire\"(1986), \"Confusion\", \"Release Yourself\", and \"Hooked On Your Love\". A 1991 release by the band titled \"Running After You\" received favourable reviews on release. He also continued to work with producer Adams in various studio groups. In addition to the hits he had with Aleem, Burgess was featured vocalist with Adams' groups Bumble Bee Unlimited, Logg, Inner Life (which also featured Jocelyn Brown), the Universal Robot Band, the Peter Jacques Band, Dazzle and M.O.D.E.

I always wanted to play. I wanted to play drums when I was about three. I made a drum out of an old butter container and hit it with tinker toys. I was going to make music. Most people who are musicians didn't have to have anyone tell them to do it. I would never push music on someone, because it is something that doesn't need to be pushed.

Both met up with Chris Barnes, Bob Rusay and Paul Mazurkiewicz, all of whom were in the band Tirant Sin. Webster was the one to come up with the band's name, Cannibal Corpse. In an interview, he said that he thought it was a very catchy name for a band. He has a reputation for being friendly to his fans, often asking questions, and genuinely caring what his fans think, regularly answering questions on the band's forum. Webster also recorded bass for Hate Eternal, Erik Rutan's death metal band.

It didn't really work out because I was six and didn't really want to learn \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" and those were the kind of songs I was being taught. I wanted to play Elvis. I liked all the old 50s music. My dad had a bunch of old 50s records because that's when he was a teenager. Those were what I listened to, because when you're six you don't have the money to go buy stuff, so I just listened to his records. Nobody was going to teach me how to play the guitar like that, out in the country where I lived. I just gave it up until I was 13 or 14. I met a kid in school who played bass in the high school jazz band. He wanted to make some extra money and it was five bucks a lesson. He did a good job too. His name was Mike Hudson. I don't know if he plays anymore. I lost touch with him. He's the one that got me started. I always wanted to play in a band, and to learn how to play lead guitar was going to take like five years. But I really liked the sound of the bass. I liked AC/DC and figured I could do that. I thought I could learn Cliff Williams' bass parts faster than I could learn to play Angus Young's guitar parts. It was motivation, because I wanted to be in a band. I never wanted to sit around and play music by myself. I wanted to play with other people, and the fastest route to that was playing an instrument that wasn't a lead instrument, and bass was that. Now I've learned to make it a lot more difficult. I've made my job a lot harder than it probably needs to be. But it's just fun. In the beginning my concern was playing in a band.\"\"I took some lessons from a friend of mine when I first started. He was in the school jazz band and he taught me the basics. I didn't take lessons for about a year, but I started again when I was a senior in high school. I've had about four different teachers throughout the years, but I never took lessons for more than a few months. I did, however, gain a lot from them and I've tried to learn as much on my own as I can. Anything I can learn about music or bass playing, I'll try to learn. I mean, the more you learn and the more you apply to your playing, it just makes you a better musician.\"\"I liked the bass player from AC/DC. I really loved the stuff he did. Peter Baltes from Accept was another. I liked the really good guys too, but that seemed out of reach at the beginning. Geddy Lee from Rush and Steve Harris were like gods to me. Billy Sheehan was from Buffalo, and we all knew about Billy before the rest of the country did. Billy has been a legend in Buffalo for a long, long time. He's still one of my favorites. By the time I was listening to Cliff Burton I was getting a little better. I had been playing a year or so before I started listening to Metallica. I thought he was great. I always thought he could have been a little louder on those albums though. That's the thing. In thrash metal or any other kind of metal where the bass is playing exactly what the guitar is playing, automatically the bass went down in the mix. If you notice those older bands like Accept, the bass is doing something that's a little bit different from the guitar. It's more with the kick drum instead of playing the riff the guitar is doing. In thrash metal and then death metal, the bass player always wound up playing what the guitar player was doing most of the time. It's been a decade long fight for us to be heard in the mix.\"\"I'd like to do some instructional material, but I'm still not sure if I'll try and do a DVD or book though. It will probably be easier to do a DVD, actually. Hopefully I'll be able to come up with some stuff that's worth releasing. I definitely won't put anything out until I'm sure it's of really high quality, and full of lots of good information. Also, you might have heard about the possibility of us doing a tab book. Well, we still haven't found a publisher for that.\"\"I practice the most when I have something I'm working on that's difficult, like one of Pat's songs for example. I usually won't practice for more than 3 or 4 hours a day unless I'm really inspired, or I have some kind of deadline.\"\n\nBesides playing bass, Alex has also contributed to lyric and music writing on many occasions for the band, some examples being \"Fucked with a Knife,\" \"Puncture Wound Massacre,\" \"I Will Kill You,\" \"Devoured by Vermin,\" \"Unleashing the Bloodthirsty,\" \"Scavenger consuming death,\" \"Scourge of iron\" and \"Murder Worship\".\nWebster is also known for his bass guitar solos/fills in such songs as \"Addicted to Vaginal Skin\", \"Mangled\", \"The Undead Will Feast\", \"Crushing the Despised\", \"Fucked with a Knife\", \"Hammer Smashed Face\", \"The Discipline of Revenge\", \"Put Them To Death\", \"She Was Asking For It\", \"Staring Through The Eyes of the Dead\", \"Bloodlands\", \"They Deserve to Die\", \"Rabid\", and \"The Strangulation Chair\".\nFrom 2013 to 2015 Webster wrote a monthly tuition column for the UK's Bass Guitar Magazine.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_42235", "text": "Webster was born in Akron, New York.

I always wanted to play. I wanted to play drums when I was about three. I made a drum out of an old butter container and hit it with tinker toys. I was going to make music. Most people who are musicians didn't have to have anyone tell them to do it. I would never push music on someone, because it is something that doesn't need to be pushed. If you're going to make music, you're going to make it.\"Webster was originally part of the band Beyond Death, with ex-Cannibal Corpse guitarist Jack Owen, in 1987. Both met up with Chris Barnes, Bob Rusay and Paul Mazurkiewicz, all of whom were in the band Tirant Sin. Webster was the one to come up with the band's name, Cannibal Corpse. In an interview, he said that he thought it was a very catchy name for a band. He has a reputation for being friendly to his fans, often asking questions, and genuinely caring what his fans think, regularly answering questions on the band's forum.

Executive producer Bryan Stinson announced the show would be casting a whole new team, with final callbacks being in September 2018. On January 12, a new team was selected, consisting of eight dancers. A promo for the new season was released in February, revealing that the show would be set around Miller's diagnosis of Burkitt's Lymphoma while returning \"back to her roots\" with a new team. The season is set in Pittsburgh, in the same studio where the show began in 2011. Season 8 premiered on Lifetime on June 4, 2019.\nAbby Lee Miller has announced season 9 of Dance Moms but there has not been further information among that point.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_42250", "text": "Notes", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is up to the protagonist Jazeta to retrieve the eight medallions, defeat Dirth, rescue Princess Aurora, and save the land and its people.\nNeutopia is widely regarded as a clone of the popular Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda in nearly every aspect.

The medallions are hidden in crypts, where each medallion is guarded by a boss. After collecting all eight of them, Jazeta gains access to the North Pole, where Dirth resides. The player controls Jazeta by moving in any direction with the control pad. Jazeta can also attack with his weapons or use items, scroll through messages, or access the \"status screen\" with the controller. Jazeta's life meter, the weapons he is currently holding, and the amount of gold and bombs remaining are displayed during gameplay on the top of the screen. On the status screen, players can choose an item to use, see which direction they must travel as indicated by the charmed compass (which also sounds an alarm when Jazeta is near a crypt or a medallion), and view the map of the crypt Jazeta is in, provided they have collected the Crystal Ball inside.\nThroughout the game, players can collect information from other non-player characters, many of whom are located in caves throughout the overworld, in which some can be uncovered only by burning objects with fire, blowing up walls with bombs, or by pushing certain rocks. While Jazeta's main weapon is a sword, he can also use other items scattered throughout the game. The \"fire rod\" unleashes fireballs whose strength and range depend on Jazeta's health level; Other items include the \"moonbeam moss\" which can illuminate dark rooms; the \"rainbow drop\" which allows Jazeta to cross small gaps; \"falcon shoes\" which give him extra speed; medicine which refills his life meter; magic rings which can transform tough enemies into weaker ones; hourglasses which temporarily stop enemies; and wings which can warp him back to the place where he last received a password.

The player controls Jazeta as he sets out to rescue Princess Aurora from Dirth. The game has four levels called spheres which Jazeta must explore and recover the two medallions from each. The medallions are hidden in crypts, where each medallion is guarded by a boss. After collecting all eight of them, Jazeta gains access to the North Pole, where Dirth resides. The player controls Jazeta by moving in any direction with the control pad. Jazeta can also attack with his weapons or use items, scroll through messages, or access the \"status screen\" with the controller. Jazeta's life meter, the weapons he is currently holding, and the amount of gold and bombs remaining are displayed during gameplay on the top of the screen. On the status screen, players can choose an item to use, see which direction they must travel as indicated by the charmed compass (which also sounds an alarm when Jazeta is near a crypt or a medallion), and view the map of the crypt Jazeta is in, provided they have collected the Crystal Ball inside.\nThroughout the game, players can collect information from other non-player characters, many of whom are located in caves throughout the overworld, in which some can be uncovered only by burning objects with fire, blowing up walls with bombs, or by pushing certain rocks. While Jazeta's main weapon is a sword, he can also use other items scattered throughout the game. The \"fire rod\" unleashes fireballs whose strength and range depend on Jazeta's health level; Other items include the \"moonbeam moss\" which can illuminate dark rooms; the \"rainbow drop\" which allows Jazeta to cross small gaps; \"falcon shoes\" which give him extra speed; medicine which refills his life meter; magic rings which can transform tough enemies into weaker ones; hourglasses which temporarily stop enemies; and wings which can warp him back to the place where he last received a password. Jazeta can also obtain sword, shield, and armor upgrades throughout the game which can increase attack power, increase defense against projectiles, and decrease enemy damage, respectively; each type of sword, shield, and armor ranges from bronze to silver to \"strongest\". Enemies in the game include spear-throwing goblins, fireball-throwing fish, fake rocks, ghosts, and charging knights.Jazeta has a life meter, which increases by one unit every time the player collects a medallion or finds a monk throughout the spheres; it decreases whenever he gets hit, and the game ends when it runs out.

At the age of twelve Persius came to Rome, where he was taught by Remmius Palaemon and the rhetor Verginius Flavus.

Not only characters, as noted above, but whole phrases, thoughts and situations come directly from him. The resemblance only emphasizes the difference between the caricaturist of Stoicism and its preacher. Persius strikes the highest note that Roman satire reached; in earnestness and moral purpose he rises far superior to the political rancour or good-natured persiflage of his predecessors and the rhetorical indignation of Juvenal.

Indeed, in some of its worst failings, straining of expression, excess of detail, exaggeration, he outbids Seneca, whilst the obscurity, which makes his little book of not seven hundred lines so difficult to read and is in no way due to great depth of thought, compares poorly with the terse clearness of the Epistolae morales.

It was originally released in the UK as Quatermass II and was produced by Anthony Hinds, directed by Val Guest, and stars Brian Donlevy with co-stars John Longden, Sidney James, Bryan Forbes, Vera Day, and William Franklyn. Quatermass 2 is a sequel to Hammer's earlier film The Quatermass Xperiment (1955). Like its predecessor, it is based on the BBC Television serial Quatermass II written by Nigel Kneale. Brian Donlevy reprises his role as the eponymous Professor Bernard Quatermass, making him the only actor to play the character twice in a film. It is often erroneously considered as the first film sequel to use the '2' / 'II' suffix within the title, though this distinction belongs to Sanshiro Sugata Part II.\nThe film's story concerns Quatermass's investigation of reports of hundreds of meteorites landing only in the Winnerden Flats area of the UK. His inquiries lead him to a huge industrial complex, strikingly similar to his own plans for a Moon colony. This top-secret facility is in fact the centre of a conspiracy involving the alien infiltration of the highest echelons of the British Government.

It then cracks open, releasing a gas, leaving him with an odd V-shaped mark on his face. Uniform-clad guards from the complex arrive, armed with sub-machine guns and sporting similar V-shaped marks, and take Marsh away, knocking down Quatermass and forcing him to leave the area.\nTrying to discover what happened to Marsh, Quatermass contacts Inspector Lomax, who had previously assisted him ( as seen in The Quatermass Xperiment). Lomax puts him in touch with Vincent Broadhead, a Member of Parliament, who has been trying to uncover the veil of secrecy surrounding Winnerden Flats and the organization and deliverance of massive quantities of material supplies and manpower without any real explanation as to what it is for. Quatermass joins Broadhead on an official tour of the complex, which he is told has been built to manufacture synthetic food. Slipping away from the visiting party, Broadhead gets inside one of the huge domes dominating the skyline. Quatermass later finds him dying, covered in a poisonous black slime, warning him about what he discovered inside the dome.\nShot at by guards as he exits, Quatermass escapes and rushes to Inspector Lomax, explaining that he believes that the complex is indeed making food, but not for human consumption. Its purpose is to provide a suitable living environment for small alien creatures being housed inside the huge domes.

The duo formed in 1993 in New York City.\nThe term S.E.T.I. stands for the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. This topic is the inspiration for and the central theme of the band's music.\nSeti's music is ambient, with few songs containing readily apparent rhythms (those with rhythm tend toward the trip hop\u2013ambient-IDM genres). The mood of the music is pervasively mysterious, grandiose and occasionally spooky; the sounds used are expansive, even alien in nature. Some songs could be considered noise music, as they include white noise and samples from radio telescopes scanning deep space (such as pulsars, radiation, supernovae, and other astronomical phenomena). Many other sounds give the impressions of quiet computers, signals travelling immense distances, garbled radio transmissions, and electrical energies. The net effect of the music is that the listener feels transported to the deep recesses of space, or feels s/he is listening to sounds, transmissions, or events in deep space. Also heard on the album Pharos is a speech given by Frank Drake, one-time president of the SETI Institute and creator of the Drake Equation, who describes the S.E.T.I. project.\nThe liner notes of the SETI's albums often feature reprints of material from the various SETI projects around the world or short essays by prominent SETI personnel.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Resident Evil 5 was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in March 2009 and for Windows in September 2009. It was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016. The plot involves an investigation of a terrorist threat by Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance agents Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar in Kijuju, a fictional region of West Africa. Chris learns that he must confront his past in the form of an old enemy, Albert Wesker, and his former partner, Jill Valentine.\nThe gameplay of Resident Evil 5 is similar to that of the previous installment, though it is the first in the series designed for two-player cooperative gameplay. It has also been considered the first game in the main series to depart from the survival horror genre, with critics saying it bore more resemblance to an action game. Motion capture was used for the cutscenes, and it was the first video game to use a virtual camera system. Several staff members from the original Resident Evil worked on Resident Evil 5. The Windows version was developed by Mercenary Technology.\nResident Evil 5 received a positive reception, despite some criticism for its control scheme. The game received some complaints of racism, though an investigation by the British Board of Film Classification found the complaints were unsubstantiated. As of December 2023, when including the original, special and remastered versions, the game had sold 13.4 million units.

He learned to play the ukulele and guitar and listened to country-and-western music by artists such as Hank Williams, Hank Snow, and Lefty Frizzell. He was drafted into the Army in 1954 and, while in Germany, played guitar in a band called The Cool Flames. When his service ended, he returned to Battle Creek, Michigan, and worked as a carpet salesman and as a truck driver for a furniture factory. He found part-time work as a rhythm guitarist in singer Doug DeMott's group, The Moonlight Ramblers, working at the Hi-Lo Club.When DeMott was fired in 1958 for drunkenness, Westover took over as leader and singer, giving himself the name Charlie Johnson and renaming the band the Big Little Show Band. In early 1959 he added the keyboardist Max Crook, who played an instrument he called a Musitron (an early synthesizer of Crook's own invention, though modeled on the commercially released Clavioline). Crook had made recordings, and he persuaded Ann Arbor disc jockey Ollie McLaughlin to listen to the band. McLaughlin took the group's demos to Harry Balk and Irving Micahnik of Talent Artists in Detroit. In July 1960, Westover and Crook signed to become recording artists and composers for Bigtop Records.

Their influences included bluegrass, folk, punk, and other musical styles. The original lineup, formed in 1990, included Danny Barnes on banjo, guitar and resonator guitar, Mark Rubin on upright bass and tuba, and Ralph White III on fiddle and accordion. Barnes composed the majority of the group's original songs. When White left the group at the end of 1996, he was briefly replaced by Bob Grant on mandolin and guitar. Barnes and Rubin then continued to perform and record as a duo until unofficially dissolving the band in 2000. The band has neither toured nor recorded since then, but Barnes and Rubin have played a few live shows with Grant in 2008, 2009, and 2014.The Bad Livers' music has often been cited for its influence on other groups, creating what The Austin Chronicle described as \"an impressive legacy\". The Stranger credited them with \"revitalizing roots music\", and, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, \"The Bad Livers helped open the way for old-time and bluegrass bands of today\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_42354", "text": "The Bad Livers formed in 1990, when Barnes \"came up with this idea that it would be great to have a small-format acoustic band that could play different kinds of music [at a] virtuoso level, where they could play any kind of music\". He began playing with Rubin and White, and the trio adopted the name Bad Livers in the summer of 1990. They began playing frequently in Austin, including a weekly set at the Saxon Pub. A typical set in 1991 included a wide variety of styles and periods of music, as Rubin later explained: \"We were doing Mississippi John Hurt, gospel tunes, Captain Beefheart\u2014anything, really, but it was Mot\u00f6rhead or the Misfits that caught on.\"Imprecise descriptions of the Bad Livers' music abounded: \"thrash-grass\", \"acoustic bluegrass with a punk death wish\", \"something called 'contemporary bluegrass,'\" and \"acoustic-metal-bluegrass\", although these same sources would cite the band as \"much-lauded\" and note that \"the musicians can really play\". The recurrence of the term bluegrass, however bizarrely it was modified, along with counter-assessments of them as \"good, faithful traditionalists\" who \"preserve the spirit as well as the technique of old-timey folk music\", created a generic perplexity that led Austin country legend Don Walser to observe that the only question he couldn't answer was what kind of music the Bad Livers played.Barnes insisted that the Bad Livers were not a bluegrass band, but had created an original sound: \"This isn't bluegrass and it isn't this or that. It's Bad Liver music. We end up making our own thing.\" Barnes' original compositions were featured on their first album, Delusions of Banjer, released in 1992 on Quarterstick Records and produced by Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers. The album was praised for \"Barnes's strong material, as well as the group's tight musical interaction\". Barnes credited the latter with improving the former: \"The musical telepathy is really good. I can sort of tailor-make a song to the guys' playing, make the song fit what they're doing, since I write most of the material.\"Rubin claimed that they had decided to incorporate the accordion and tuba into the band to counteract their growing popularity, but to no avail: their audience continued to widen and more critics saw beyond the gimmicky descriptions to the band's innovation and skill. The Washington Post described them as \"truly great\", The Times-Picayune praised their \"serious musicianship\" and Barnes' \"soulful, urgent lead vocals\", while Rolling Stone admired their \"striking blend of virtuoso flash and poignant simplicity\". Don McLeese of the Austin American-Statesman twice described the Bad Livers as \"Austin's best band\" and raved of one live show: \"The uncommon telepathy enjoyed by Danny Barnes, Mark Rubin and Ralph White makes the band's frenetic acoustic interplay sound like the work of a six-armed, multistringed monster.\" Barnes was voted \"Best Player of Any Other Instrument\" for the banjo at the Austin Music Awards in 1991 and 1992, and the Bad Livers were voted \"Best None of the Above\" for four consecutive years from 1991 to 1994.The Bad Livers' second album, Horses in the Mines, was produced by Barnes and released on Quarterstick in 1994. In his review, McLeese admired them as \"a band drawing from the wellspring of tradition to create something fresh, vital and original\". S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung found that the record \"sounded quite authentic\u2014almost as if it had long held a place in the Library of Congress\". Raoul Hern\u00e1ndez poetically concurred, saying that the record sounded \"like a bunch of skeletons cackling into the sole microphone that dangles from the outhouse ceiling\".The Bad Livers spent 1995 and 1996 touring and working on side projects as well as looking for a new label to release their next album. Finally the band signed a three-album deal with Sugar Hill Records, which had more experience than Quarterstick at \"selling banjo records\". Their first album for the label, Hogs on the Highway, was released along with the information that White had decided to leave the band. It was announced that he was to be replaced by Bob Grant, though Grant's tenure with the band did not last long. Both White and Grant appeared on Hogs on the Highway, which received enthusiastic reviews from Sing Out!, praising Barnes' \"quirky and inventive\" original songs, and the Old-Time Herald, admiring the \"considerable skill\" with which Barnes crafted his lyrics. The Austin American-Statesman agreed that Barnes was \"an entirely underrated songwriter\" as well as a \"banjo wizard\", while The Washington Post lauded his \"timeless, deadpan voice\". The Sydney Morning Herald was appreciative of the \"beautifully controlled ambience\" of the entire album.\nShortly after the album's release, Barnes moved from Austin to Port Hadlock, Washington, though he and Rubin continued to work closely together on the score for the Richard Linklater film The Newton Boys as well as the Bad Livers' next album. Although the soundtrack was admired by The Village Voice and Entertainment Weekly as well as the Austin papers, the film did not fare well at the box office, and the soundtrack album did not sell well. The Bad Livers' second album for Sugar Hill, Industry and Thrift, was released in September 1998 with only Barnes and Rubin credited as members of the band, though the album features various guest musicians, including members of Rubin's side project, Rubinchik\u2019s Orkestyr, who are featured on the track \"A Yid Ist Geboren inz Oklahoma\". The album garnered positive reviews, and the Chicago Tribune selected it as the best bluegrass album of 1998, while The Times of London admired its \"genuine originality\". Industry and Thrift did not receive as much attention from the press as Hogs on the Highway had, however, and as Barnes lamented, the album \"fell off the face of the earth\".The Bad Livers' final album, Blood and Mood, was released in February 2000 and featured, as The Austin Chronicle noted with astonishment: \"Electric punk rock, sample-based tunes with drum tracks, and a shocking scarcity of juiced-up banjo playing\".

Carnival of Souls was Harvey's only feature film, and did not gain widespread attention when originally released as a double feature with the now mostly forgotten The Devil's Messenger in 1962.\nSince the 1980s, the film has been noted by critics and film scholars for its cinematography and foreboding atmosphere.

(The club made several appearances in movies like Dolemite and Black Fist.) Simmons' nightclub booked R&B-oriented musical acts, and Simmons' interest in music led him to buy a recording studio. In 1978, he signed a little-known R&B act, the Greenwood, Archer and Pine Street Band, (shortened in 1973 by a typo to the Gap Band) to his production company, and secured a record deal with Mercury Records. The band, consisting of twelve members, was reduced officially to the three Wilson brothers. Their first Total Experience-produced single, 1979's \"Shake\", went to #4 on the R&B charts.\nSimmons' skills as a composer, however, would take the Gap Band to the next level. When they released The Gap Band II late in 1979, a song Simmons co-wrote with the Wilson brothers, \"Oops Up Side Your Head\", not only matched the success of \"Shake\" on the R&B charts, reaching #4 also, but exceeded it by propelling the album to over half-a-million in sales. Simmons had co-written only one song on The Gap Band but co-wrote six of The Gap Band II's seven tracks.\nIn 1980, Charlie Wilson went on a trip to Dallas and returned with two new friends: Cavin Yarbrough and Alisa Peoples. After a brief audition, Simmons exchanged contact information with them.

They recorded the demo, and when he heard it, Simmons had yet another act in his ranks: Yarbrough and Peoples. That year, Simmons co-wrote two songs which peaked on the R&B charts at #1 back-to-back: \"Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)\", which was released on The Gap Band III, and \"Don't Stop the Music\", which was released on Yarbrough & Peoples' debut album, The Two of Us.

He then transferred the Gap Band and Yarbrough & Peoples (who were already signed to his production company) to the Total Experience label. Gap Band IV was released in early 1982 and spawned three singles, which all peaked in the top-40 on the dance charts and top-2 on the R&B songs: #1 \"Early in the Morning\", #2 \"You Dropped a Bomb on Me\" (both of which Simmons helped write), and #1 \"Outstanding\", the first two of which Simmons wrote.

The album went gold, headlined by the only Simmons co-penned single, \"Party Train\", which went to #3 on the R&B charts.

(The club made several appearances in movies like Dolemite and Black Fist.) Simmons' nightclub booked R&B-oriented musical acts, and Simmons' interest in music led him to buy a recording studio. In 1978, he signed a little-known R&B act, the Greenwood, Archer and Pine Street Band, (shortened in 1973 by a typo to the Gap Band) to his production company, and secured a record deal with Mercury Records. The band, consisting of twelve members, was reduced officially to the three Wilson brothers. Their first Total Experience-produced single, 1979's \"Shake\", went to #4 on the R&B charts.\nSimmons' skills as a composer, however, would take the Gap Band to the next level. When they released The Gap Band II late in 1979, a song Simmons co-wrote with the Wilson brothers, \"Oops Up Side Your Head\", not only matched the success of \"Shake\" on the R&B charts, reaching #4 also, but exceeded it by propelling the album to over half-a-million in sales.

It was adapted from an original screenplay by Dardano Sacchetti to serve as a sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978), which was released in Italy under the title Zombi. It stars Tisa Farrow, Ian McCulloch, and Richard Johnson, and features a score by frequent Fulci collaborator Fabio Frizzi. Frizzi's score has been released independently of the film, and he has performed it live on tour.\nThe film is set at a Caribbean island cursed by voodoo whose dead residents rise as zombies to attack the living. A scientist's daughter journeys to the island after her father's boat turns up abandoned in New York City. Intended by its writer as a return to \"classic zombie tales\", Zombi 2 was filmed in Italy, with further location shooting in New York and Santo Domingo.\nProduced on a small budget of 410 million Italian lira, the film earned several times its production costs back in international gross.

She auditioned with Alan Thicke, who was coming off the failure of his TV talk show Thicke of the Night. Kerns joked in many interviews that she and Alan had immediate chemistry, especially when she kissed him on his nose by accident during their audition together. Kerns and Thicke's chemistry won them both the parts, and the two became great friends off the show; they both had many things in common, including both being newly divorced and both being single parents.In 1985, Tracey Gold auditioned for Carol Seaver's role on Growing Pains but was not initially cast. The actress chosen for the pilot was Elizabeth Ward, who had starred alongside Gold in The Hand-Me-Down Kid, a 1983 ABC Afterschool Special. However, test audiences did not favor Ward in Carol's role, and Gold promptly replaced her. In 1988 at age 19, Gold gained some weight over the Growing Pains series hiatus. That season, the sitcom's scripts called for her to be the brunt of fat jokes from her television brothers for many episodes in a row.\nIn October 1988, Gold dieted from 133 pounds to about 110 pounds on a medically supervised 500-calorie-a-day (2,100 kJ) diet, but occasionally, the scripts still included fat jokes at her expense. In her memoir, she says that between 1989 and 1991, she became increasingly obsessed with food and her weight and continued to slowly and steadily lose weight.Kirk Cameron was an atheist in his early teens. When he was 17, during the height of his career on Growing Pains, he became a born-again Christian. After converting to Protestant Christianity, he began to insist that plot lines be edited to remove anything he thought too adult or inappropriate in Growing Pains. Cameron's conversion is said to have alienated him from his fellow cast members, as he did not invite any of them to his 1991 wedding.Julie McCullough landed the role of nanny Julie Costello on the show in 1989. Her character appeared in eight episodes until McCullough was fired in 1990. Though the show's producers have claimed that her character was never intended to be permanent and Cameron stated in his 2008 memoir Still Growing that he did not call for her firing, it is alleged McCullough's termination from the show was a result of Cameron's objections to her having posed nude in Playboy, prompting Cameron to claim to the producers they were promoting pornography by hiring McCullough. Cameron reportedly did not reconcile with McCullough, who claims that Cameron refused to speak to her during a later encounter. She remains critical of him, stating that the public criticism she endured during the controversy damaged her career.\nAt about age 14, Jeremy Miller received numerous letters from an older male stalker during the run of Growing Pains.In 1990, Tracey Gold began group therapy in an eating disorder program but only learned more ways to lose weight. That season, her weight loss problem was touched upon slightly on the series, when Gold is seen looking at her body in a carnival mirror and describes to another character the distorted image in her head. In 1991, she started starving herself more than ever and vomiting, and lost a massive amount of weight, to the point that she was admitted to a hospital in early 1992. Her lowest weight is estimated to have been near 80 pounds. She was suspended from the show for her skeletal appearance. Photos of Gold's emaciated body were plastered all over tabloid magazines, and she was one of the first celebrities ever to be formally outed for anorexia. She last appeared in the 1991 episode, \"Menage a Luke,\" after missing the two prior episodes where her problem is very obvious in some scenes and did not return until the last two episodes of the series in the late spring of 1992. Gold eventually recovered from her years-long struggle and starred in the 1994 television movie For the Love of Nancy, drawing on her own experiences with anorexia nervosa to portray the title character.In 1991, Leonardo DiCaprio became a recurring cast member on Growing Pains, playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the Seaver family. Co-star Joanna Kerns recalled DiCaprio being \"especially intelligent and disarming for his age,\" but also mischievous on set. The teenage DiCaprio was cast by the producers to appeal to the teenage female audiences, but when the show's ratings did not improve, DiCaprio left. He was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor Co-starring in a Television Series.In 1992, Alan Thicke appeared in the pilot episode of the sitcom Hangin' with Mr. Cooper. He appeared in the pre-credits teaser scene, alongside series star Mark Curry, humorously referencing the pilot episode being filmed on the same set used as the Seavers' home on Growing Pains.After the series was canceled, Kirk Cameron did not maintain contact with his former co-stars and did not speak to Tracey Gold for eight years. Cameron has stated that this was not due to any animosity on his part toward any of his former cast-members but an outgrowth of his desire to start a new life away from the entertainment industry. In 2000, Cameron revealed he apologized to his TV family for some of his prior behavior, saying, \"If I could go back, I think I could make decisions that were less inadvertently hurtful to the cast--like talking and explaining to them why I just wanted to have my family at my wedding.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_42509", "text": "The show centers on the Seaver family of Huntington, Long Island, New York.

In the latter, a one-lap qualification drive must be passed before each race, determining the starting position in the grid, and also serving as a short practice for the upcoming course.\nIn both, player drivers and rival drivers can be freely selected. Each driver in the game is divided into three levels based on real-life skill: A, B, and C. Because there are less entries than there are racers, these choices directly affect the game's difficulty.\nPit stops are included, and a team-radio imitation tells the player when to go to the pits for tires, wing and engine repair. Weather forecasts are available before every racing session. However, in rare cases the weather can change during the race, forcing players to make an unscheduled change of tires.Each race has five laps, allowing for an arcade-like experience. Colliding (even sharply) with the opponents' cars heavily damages the opponent and slightly decreases the player's own stats.
