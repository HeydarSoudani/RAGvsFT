{"id": "407_2", "question": "Which language was Il ritorno di Tobia written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_5339", "text": "Il ritorno di Tobia (The Return of Tobias) is an oratorio in two parts composed in 1775 by Joseph Haydn (Hob. XXI:1). The work is the first oratorio the composer wrote and, according to Jones, was \"his most extended and ambitious composition up to that time\".The Italian-language libretto of the work is by Giovanni Gastone Boccherini, brother of the composer Luigi Boccherini. This libretto is harshly criticized by Olleson, who notes that the author de-dramatizes vivid episodes in the source (the story of Tobit in the Apocrypha), depriving Haydn of the opportunity for highly dramatic musical utterance.The work was premiered in Vienna on 2 April 1775, under the sponsorship of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, a musician's benevolent society. The musical forces were substantial: Smither writes: \"characteristic of the large forces used for the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t concerts, the orchestra, chorus, and soloists possibly numbered more than 180 performers.\" He adds that the premiere was \"enormously successful.\"In 1784, Haydn substantially revised the work, with cuts to make numbers shorter and new choruses, for another of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t's benefit concerts. It is thought that at this concert Haydn first met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who became his good friend. One of the soprano soloists was Nancy Storace, also a friend of Haydn, who later was Mozart's first Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro.In 1808 the oratorio made a third appearance on the program of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, this time in a revised version by the now-elderly composer's pupil, Sigismund Neukomm. The performance on the night of 22 December, which required the labors of most of the highly qualified musicians in Vienna, had regrettable consequences for a now-famous rival concert taking place in Vienna on the same evening, the benefit for Ludwig van Beethoven that premiered his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies.\nToday, Il ritorno di Tobia is eclipsed by Haydn's later works in this genre \u2013 The Creation and The Seasons \u2013 and is seldom performed or recorded.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_5340", "text": "Soloists:\n\nTobia (tenor)\nAnna, Tobia's mother (alto)\nTobit, Tobia's father (bass)\nSara, Tobia's wife (soprano)\nRaffaele, an angel (soprano)Hebrew choir (SATB) and orchestra\nThe venue of the event is the Tobias parents' house in Nineveh.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_5341", "text": "1980 \u2013 Barbara Hendricks (Raffaelle), Linda Zoghby (Sara), Della Jones (Anna), Philip Langridge (Tobia), Benjamin Luxon (Tobit) \u2013 Brighton Festival Chorus, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Antal Dor\u00e1ti \u2013 3 CDs (Decca Records)\n1987 \u2013 Magda Kalm\u00e1r (Raffaelle), Veronika Kincses (Sara), Kl\u00e1ra Tak\u00e1cs (Anna), Attila F\u00fcl\u00f6p (Tobia), Zsolt Bende (Tobit) \u2013 Budapest Madrigal Choir, Budapest State Orchestra, Ferenc Szekeres \u2013 3 CDs (Hungaroton)\n2006 \u2013 Roberta Invernizzi (Raffaelle), Sophie Karth\u00e4user (Sara), Ann Hallenberg (Anna), Anders J.

The lyrics are less political and more personal than previous Radiohead albums.\nRadiohead released In Rainbows online and allowed fans to set their own price, saying this liberated them from conventional promotional formats and removed barriers to audiences. It was the first such release by a major act and drew international media attention. Many praised Radiohead for challenging old models and finding new ways to connect with fans, while others felt it set a dangerous precedent at the expense of less successful artists.\nRadiohead promoted In Rainbows with webcasts, music videos, competitions and a worldwide tour. \"Jigsaw Falling into Place\" and \"Nude\" were released as singles; \"Nude\" became Radiohead's first US top-40 song since their debut single \"Creep\" (1992). The retail release of In Rainbows topped the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200, and by October 2008 it had sold over three million copies worldwide. It was the bestselling vinyl record of 2008, and is certified platinum in the UK and Canada and gold in the US, Belgium and Japan.

Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Am\u00e9lie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Am\u00e9lie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Am\u00e9lie retrieves it.\nAm\u00e9lie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Am\u00e9lie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina, concerned for Am\u00e9lie's well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph's comment about this misleads Am\u00e9lie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina.

In 1784 or 1785 he moved to Paris, working at tapestry and carpet stores on rue de la Huchette and studying art at l\u2019Academie royale de peinture under Joseph-Laurent Malaine, at the Gobelins Manufactory. During the French exposition of 1798, he produced some paintings for the carpet manufacturers Gobelins and Savonnerie and for the porcelain makers Dihl and Gerhard. He also made illustrations of insects for the French naturalist Sonnini and illustrated a book by Fournier on Egypt. He then produced a series of watercolours of birds and flowers between 1801 and 1804 by direct commission of Napoleon Bonaparte.

Engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), with a team led by Alan Stern, the spacecraft was launched in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system in 2015, and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in the decade to follow, which became a mission to 486958 Arrokoth. It is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System.\nOn January 19, 2006, New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station by an Atlas V rocket directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about 16.26 km/s (10.10 mi/s; 58,500 km/h; 36,400 mph). It was the fastest (average speed with respect to Earth) human-made object ever launched from Earth. It is not the fastest speed recorded for a spacecraft, which, as of 2023, is that of the Parker Solar Probe. After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL, New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter, making its closest approach on February 28, 2007, at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles). The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons' speed; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons' scientific capabilities, returning data about the planet's atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere.\nMost of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve onboard systems, except for brief annual checkouts. On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter, and instrument check-out began. On January 15, 2015, the spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto.\nOn July 14, 2015, at 11:49 UTC, it flew 12,500 km (7,800 mi) above the surface of Pluto, which at the time was 34 AU from the Sun, making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet. In August 2016, New Horizons was reported to have traveled at speeds of more than 84,000 km/h (52,000 mph). On October 25, 2016, at 21:48 UTC, the last recorded data from the Pluto flyby was received from New Horizons. Having completed its flyby of Pluto, New Horizons then maneuvered for a flyby of Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth (then nicknamed Ultima Thule), which occurred on January 1, 2019, when it was 43.4 AU (6.49 billion km; 4.03 billion mi) from the Sun. In August 2018, NASA cited results by Alice on New Horizons to confirm the existence of a \"hydrogen wall\" at the outer edges of the Solar System.

It was founded on November 15, 1867, and it is the oldest Argentine newspaper still in circulation, which has gained it the title of Decano de la Prensa Argentina (\"Dean of the Argentine Press\"). \nThe name was chosen by its founder, Ovidio Lagos, as a political statement on the part of those, including him, who were lobbying to move the capital of the federal government to Rosario. Rosario was in fact declared the capital three times by Congress, only to face presidential vetoes each time.\nAt the time of its foundation, La Capital was an afternoon newspaper. Newspapers were just forums of political debate with classified ads. Since the beginning, the heading of La Capital included a motto showing a commitment to public opinion: Las columnas de La Capital pertenecen al pueblo, \"La Capital's columns belong to the people\".\nOn 19 August 1868 the editorial building was at 104 Santa Fe St. After that, La Capital turned into a morning newspaper, and in 1870 it moved to Port St. (now Buenos Aires St.). In 1874 and again in 1887 new printing machinery was acquired. In 1889 the editorial moved to a new building at 763 Sarmiento St. and acquired a French Marinoni reaction printer.\nIn 1903 the newspaper changed the format of its pages, abandoning the large sheet sizes. By 1905 the daily edition had 16 pages, and in 1906 it offered a full-color 28-page illustrated supplement.\nFor 111 years, since its foundation, the newspaper employed the \"hot type\" method, that is, with Linotype typesetting machines where molten lead and antimony were used to cast each line of text. In 1978 La Capital shifted to \"cold type\", using the phototypesetting method.\nIn mid-1998 the new publishing plant at Santiago St. near Rivadavia Ave. received its latest innovation, a Goss Urbanite rotating press which weighs 165 tonnes and measures almost 36 m in length. The new plant also features a number of other technologies. Using this, La Capital started a new edition, with a different layout and format, and fully in color.\nBesides national and international news, the newspaper covers local news from Rosario and its metropolitan area (Greater Rosario), plus other towns in the region and four other provinces besides Santa Fe, reaching about 2 million readers.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was released on March 23, 2007, by Epic Records. After including some Spanish songs on her first two albums, Lopez initially became interested in recording a full-length studio album in 2004 when she recorded a song with her then-husband Marc Anthony for his ninth studio album. After releasing her fourth studio album, Rebirth (2005), Lopez started working heavily on the album with Anthony, Est\u00e9fano and Julio Reyes Copello in a period of two and a half years. Composed entirely of ballads (and the exception of a few other genres), Como Ama una Mujer talks about love and heartbreak, being organic in its instrumentation and introspective in its lyrics.\nThe album was given a mixed reception from music critics, with many praising her vocals for being more improved than her previous records, but thought the album was too serious and questioned a lack of highlights within the album. Commercially, the album debuted inside the top ten of the US Billboard 200 and marked the highest first-week sales for an artist's debut Spanish album. Elsewhere, it topped the Switzerland charts and became a top-ten album in eight other countries.\nTwo singles were released from the album: \"Qu\u00e9 Hiciste\" and \"Me Haces Falta\". The first was released on January 26, 2007, and became a success in many countries, reaching number-one in Italy, Spain, Switzerland and on the US Hot Latin Songs, and a top-ten hit elsewhere, while the second single was released  on March 23, 2007, but was a commercial disappointment.

According to Lopez: \"My life took a different turn, which was great for me. But my heart was always kind of on the Spanish side.\" Later, throughout her career as a singer, she included two tracks in Spanish on her debut album, On the 6 (1999), with one being the single \"No Me Ames\" and five on her sophomore studio album, J.Lo (2001).Plans for Lopez to release a full-length Spanish-language album materialized in 2004, when Lopez's then-husband Marc Anthony was finishing up production of his ninth studio album Amar Sin Mentiras (2004) with Est\u00e9fano and Julio Reyes Copello. Lopez went into the recording studio with them to record a song entitled \"Escap\u00e9monos\", as a duet with Anthony. She enjoyed working on the song so much that she decided to record a full-length Spanish album; something she had wanted to do for years. In the same year, she recorded a Spanish version of the song \"Sway\", called \"Qui\u00e9n Ser\u00e1\", for her film Shall We Dance? (2004), but the English version recorded by Pussycat Dolls was used instead. Before recording began for her first Spanish album, Lopez recorded and released her fourth English studio album Rebirth (2005).In early 2006 it was announced that Lopez would release her first Spanish album and her fifth studio album Como Ama una Mujer later that year and that she worked mostly with Colombian record producer Est\u00e9fano, Reyes and Anthony. Amidst the recording process, she was also shooting a film with Anthony, El Cantante (2007) and providing vocals for its soundtrack entirely done by Anthony, as well as recording a more \"urban-leaning\" full-English album.

She said: \"You have to have a total command of the language, so I couldn\u2019t write it all myself, you know what I mean?. I had to really depend on people to express what I was feeling.\" Lopez also emphasized that she really expressed to the writers the kind of album she wanted to make and the things that were important for her.

According to Lopez: \"My life took a different turn, which was great for me. But my heart was always kind of on the Spanish side.\" Later, throughout her career as a singer, she included two tracks in Spanish on her debut album, On the 6 (1999), with one being the single \"No Me Ames\" and five on her sophomore studio album, J.Lo (2001).Plans for Lopez to release a full-length Spanish-language album materialized in 2004, when Lopez's then-husband Marc Anthony was finishing up production of his ninth studio album Amar Sin Mentiras (2004) with Est\u00e9fano and Julio Reyes Copello. Lopez went into the recording studio with them to record a song entitled \"Escap\u00e9monos\", as a duet with Anthony. She enjoyed working on the song so much that she decided to record a full-length Spanish album; something she had wanted to do for years. In the same year, she recorded a Spanish version of the song \"Sway\", called \"Qui\u00e9n Ser\u00e1\", for her film Shall We Dance? (2004), but the English version recorded by Pussycat Dolls was used instead. Before recording began for her first Spanish album, Lopez recorded and released her fourth English studio album Rebirth (2005).In early 2006 it was announced that Lopez would release her first Spanish album and her fifth studio album Como Ama una Mujer later that year and that she worked mostly with Colombian record producer Est\u00e9fano, Reyes and Anthony. Amidst the recording process, she was also shooting a film with Anthony, El Cantante (2007) and providing vocals for its soundtrack entirely done by Anthony, as well as recording a more \"urban-leaning\" full-English album. According to Est\u00e9fano, Como Ama una Mujer was going to \"prove critics wrong\" from its \"big songs that require a voice\"; referring to the critics about Lopez having a \"limited\" vocal tone. After working on the album, Lopez said that she matured as singer, stating: \n\n\"I've matured as a singer. Marc gave me confidence in the studio as well. When someone believes in you so much, you don't want to let them down. And it's also the material. I think this material lent itself to my voice.

Intended for release in March 2001, the album was shelved by EMI/Virgin, leading Bowie to depart the label and begin work on his next album Heathen (2002). Various Toy tracks saw release as B-sides and bonus tracks in the ensuing years; two were remade for Heathen and two appeared on the Nothing Has Changed compilation in 2014.\nDifferent mixes of the Toy tracks leaked onto the Internet in 2011, which caught media attention. Ten years later, Warner Music Group announced in September 2021 that Toy would get an official release as part of the box set Brilliant Adventure (1992\u20132001) on 26 November, through Bowie's own ISO label and Parlophone.

Sayid, an austere Central Asian, comes to Sukhov's rescue in sticky situations throughout the movie. Sukhov frees Sayid, and they strike a friendly but reticent relationship. While traveling together they are caught up in a desert fight between a Red Army cavalry unit and Basmachi guerrillas. The cavalry unit commander, Rakhimov, leaves to Sukhov the harem of the Basmachi leader Abdullah, left behind by him, for temporary protection. He also leaves a young Red Army soldier, Petrukha, to assist Sukhov with the task, and proceeds to pursue the fleeing Abdullah.\nSukhov and women from Abdullah's harem return to a nearby shore village. There, Sukhov charges the local museum's curator with protecting the women, and prepares to head home. Sukhov hopes to \"modernize\" the wives of the harem, and make them part of the modern society. He urges them to take off their burqa and reject polygamy. The wives are loath to do this, though, and as Sukhov takes on the role of protector, the wives declare him their new husband.\nSoon, looking for a seaway across the border, Abdullah and his gang come to the same village and find Abdullah's wives. Sukhov is bound to stay. Hoping to obtain help and weapons, Sukhov and Petrukha visit Pavel Vereschagin, a former Tsar's customs official. Vereschagin warms to Petrukha who reminds him of his dead son, but after discussing the matter with his nagging wife, Vereschagin refuses. Sukhov finds a machine gun and a case of dynamite that he plants on Abdullah's ship. Meanwhile, Abdullah has confronted his wives, and is preparing to punish them for their \"dishonor\", as they did not kill themselves when Abdullah left them. Sukhov manages to capture and lock Abdullah as a hostage, but after he leaves, Abdullah convinces Gyulchatai, the youngest wife of the harem, to free him and then kills Gyulchatai and Petrukha.\nThe museum curator shows Sukhov an ancient underground passage that leads to the sea. Sukhov and the women of the harem attempt to escape through the passage, but on arriving at the seashore they are impelled to hide in a large empty oil tank. Abdullah discovers that and plans on setting the oil tank on fire.\nEnraged at the cold-hearted murder of Petrukha, Vereschagin decides to help Sukhov and takes Abdullah's ship. Sayid also helps Sukhov, and together they fend off Abdullah's gang.

Vereschagin lives a lonely life as the only Russian, along with his wife, in a remote village. The walls of his house are covered with pictures of the military campaigns where he was awarded and wounded. The Civil War has left him without an official job and a place to go. He is a big man and a straightforward person with a tendency for alcoholism due to the nostalgia for his past. He has an arsenal of weapons that brings both conflicting parties (Sukhov and Abdullah's men) to his house at some point in the film. Initially neutral, he eventually takes the side of Sukhov.This was Luspekayev's last role. A World War II veteran and an experienced stage actor, both of his feet were amputated in the 1960s due to past injuries. Given Luspekayev's condition, Motyl wrote a script for a man on crutches.

There will be no rest while Dzhavdet is alive.\" Sayid suddenly appears every now and then to help Sukhov against bandits, but when asked why, simply replies that he has \"heard shooting,\" giving an impression that he just seeks Dzhavdet via any armed conflict nearby.In contrast with Luspekayev, this was one of the first movie roles for Mishulin, although he was previously active as a TV and stage actor.Kakhi Kavsadze as Abdullah \u2013 a cunning Basmachi leader with no respect for human life. Both he and Sayid originate from poor families, and their fathers were friends. However, contrary to Sayid, Abdullah took the path of banditry.Kavsadze, a Georgian by nationality, fit very well into the role of an Asian gang leader.

The movie opens with a panoramic shot of a bucolic Russian countryside. Katerina Matveyevna, Sukhov's beloved wife, is standing in a field. Awakening from this daydream, Sukhov is walking through the Central Asian desert \u2013 a stark contrast to his homeland. He finds Sayid buried in the sand. Sayid, an austere Central Asian, comes to Sukhov's rescue in sticky situations throughout the movie. Sukhov frees Sayid, and they strike a friendly but reticent relationship. While traveling together they are caught up in a desert fight between a Red Army cavalry unit and Basmachi guerrillas. The cavalry unit commander, Rakhimov, leaves to Sukhov the harem of the Basmachi leader Abdullah, left behind by him, for temporary protection. He also leaves a young Red Army soldier, Petrukha, to assist Sukhov with the task, and proceeds to pursue the fleeing Abdullah.\nSukhov and women from Abdullah's harem return to a nearby shore village. There, Sukhov charges the local museum's curator with protecting the women, and prepares to head home. Sukhov hopes to \"modernize\" the wives of the harem, and make them part of the modern society. He urges them to take off their burqa and reject polygamy. The wives are loath to do this, though, and as Sukhov takes on the role of protector, the wives declare him their new husband.\nSoon, looking for a seaway across the border, Abdullah and his gang come to the same village and find Abdullah's wives. Sukhov is bound to stay. Hoping to obtain help and weapons, Sukhov and Petrukha visit Pavel Vereschagin, a former Tsar's customs official. Vereschagin warms to Petrukha who reminds him of his dead son, but after discussing the matter with his nagging wife, Vereschagin refuses. Sukhov finds a machine gun and a case of dynamite that he plants on Abdullah's ship. Meanwhile, Abdullah has confronted his wives, and is preparing to punish them for their \"dishonor\", as they did not kill themselves when Abdullah left them. Sukhov manages to capture and lock Abdullah as a hostage, but after he leaves, Abdullah convinces Gyulchatai, the youngest wife of the harem, to free him and then kills Gyulchatai and Petrukha.\nThe museum curator shows Sukhov an ancient underground passage that leads to the sea. Sukhov and the women of the harem attempt to escape through the passage, but on arriving at the seashore they are impelled to hide in a large empty oil tank. Abdullah discovers that and plans on setting the oil tank on fire.\nEnraged at the cold-hearted murder of Petrukha, Vereschagin decides to help Sukhov and takes Abdullah's ship. Sayid also helps Sukhov, and together they fend off Abdullah's gang. Vereschagin, unaware of the dynamite on the ship and not hearing Sukhov's shouted warnings, dies on the exploding ship.\nSukhov kills Abdullah and his gang, returns the harem to Rakhimov and bids farewell to Sayid. He then begins his journey home on foot, having refused a horse since a horse is merely \"a nuisance\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_5609", "text": "Anatoly Kuznetsov as Fyodor Ivanovich Sukhov \u2013 a Red Army soldier, who returns home on foot through the desert after recovering in a hospital from wounds sustained in the war. He shows much wisdom and skill in his actions and a gentle human side in his graphical dreams, in which he mentally writes letters to his beloved wife.Georgi Yumatov was chosen for the role, but was dismissed for a drunken brawl right before the shooting. Therefore, Motyl called for Kuznetsov, who was the second choice during the selection.Pavel Luspekayev as Pavel Vereschagin \u2013 a former tsarist customs official. Vereschagin lives a lonely life as the only Russian, along with his wife, in a remote village. The walls of his house are covered with pictures of the military campaigns where he was awarded and wounded. The Civil War has left him without an official job and a place to go. He is a big man and a straightforward person with a tendency for alcoholism due to the nostalgia for his past. He has an arsenal of weapons that brings both conflicting parties (Sukhov and Abdullah's men) to his house at some point in the film. Initially neutral, he eventually takes the side of Sukhov.This was Luspekayev's last role. A World War II veteran and an experienced stage actor, both of his feet were amputated in the 1960s due to past injuries. Given Luspekayev's condition, Motyl wrote a script for a man on crutches. Luspekayev refused, arguing that his character should appear not as a cripple, but as a strong person who died prematurely. While filming, he walked on prosthetic legs and had to take regular rests due to pain. He died in 1970.Spartak Mishulin as Sayid \u2013 a skilled man of few words. He seeks revenge on Dzhavdet, a Basmachi gang leader who killed his father, robbed his family and buried him in sand for a slow death; otherwise his motives and reactions are unclear and unexpected. For example, after Sukhov dug him out, Sayid, instead of thanking him, says, \"Why did you dig me out? There will be no rest while Dzhavdet is alive.\" Sayid suddenly appears every now and then to help Sukhov against bandits, but when asked why, simply replies that he has \"heard shooting,\" giving an impression that he just seeks Dzhavdet via any armed conflict nearby.In contrast with Luspekayev, this was one of the first movie roles for Mishulin, although he was previously active as a TV and stage actor.Kakhi Kavsadze as Abdullah \u2013 a cunning Basmachi leader with no respect for human life. Both he and Sayid originate from poor families, and their fathers were friends. However, contrary to Sayid, Abdullah took the path of banditry.Kavsadze, a Georgian by nationality, fit very well into the role of an Asian gang leader. However, he had never ridden a horse, while his character was supposed to be a keen horse rider. He never actually rides in the film, but only sits on a horse, or even on the shoulders of an assistant.Nikolai Godovikov as Petrukha \u2013 a young Red Army soldier.

Feng concluded that the fact that Juehui leaves his house means that \"his conflicts with the traditional family system are more fundamental and irreconcilable than those in Qin's case.\" Feng argued that the author \"deployed Qin to magnify Juehui's revolutionary zeal\" by emphasizing differences that the two characters have in their emotional responses and respective relationships to the members of the Gao family and also \"located the source of Qin's weakness in her gender and thus reaffirmed Juehui's superiority.\"\nMaster Gao - The head of the Gao family.As Master Gao grows older, he attempts to reunite the Gao family.\nHan argues that Master Gao is \"complex\".

Even though Juexin is in love with Mei, his cousin, he marries Li Ruijue on the orders of Master Gao after he graduates from middle school. After Juemin escapes from the Gao household, Master Gao asks Juexin to find Juemin. Juexin asks Juehui to help him, but the youngest brother accuses Juexin of being a coward. After learning about Mei's death, Juexin is saddened. Han said that \"[t]he miserable experience\" awakens Juexin, who begins opposing Master Gao.\nMei Han, author of the entry on \"Family\" in The Facts on File Companion to the World Novel: 1900 to the Present, said that Juexin \"is a victim of conservatism\" who is asked to stop observing idealism, loses the women who are dear to him, and \"does nothing but cries in the corner.\" Jin Feng, author of The New Woman in Early Twentieth-Century Chinese Fiction, said that Juexin is \"a character used by a foil to impress upon the reader Juehui's revolutionary courage as compared to people of his own generation and gender.\" Feng added that while Juehui believes that Juexin is a '\"coward who makes \"unnecessary sacrifices\" of himself and the women he loves', Juehui \"cannot help but sympathize with Juexin's dilemma, and in fact often depends on him as a buffer against abuses by their grandfather and uncles.\" Han says that Juexin is also an \"accomplice\" since he helps Master Gao try to find Juemin, and that Juexin \"insists on nonresistance\" despite the fact that he agrees with his brothers.

At the end of the novel, he believes staying in the family is too suffocating, so he leaves Chengdu to go to Shanghai.\nAccording to Feng, Juehui is \"the center of consciousness\" in Family. Feng said that while Juehui \"is apparently the most fearless and rebellious of the three brothers\" he also \"is by no means the heroic role model that he has read about in new books and journals\u2014the sources of all his new ideas.\" Feng argues that \"Juehui betrays the most pronounced contradictions through his interactions with his family\" and that Juehui \"often finds himself helplessly entangled in ambivalent feelings\" while dealing with his family, using his interactions with Juexin as an example. Han argued that while being \"high-spirited youth rebelling against his family's restrictions\", Juehui \"still possesses ideas\" from the Gao Family traditions.

It was based on the fantasy novel series The Witcher by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The game's story takes place after the events of the main saga.It was released in 2007 to positive reviews from critics and received an aggregate score of 81/100 on Metacritic. In 2009, a console version, The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf, was scheduled for release using an entirely new engine and combat system. This was suspended as a result of payment problems with console developers Widescreen Games. The first game has, to date, two sequels, namely The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015.\nA remake of The Witcher was announced in October 2022, which was formerly first teased under the codename \"Canis Majoris\". Entitled The Witcher Remake, it will be developed using Unreal Engine 5, the same engine in use for the planned second trilogy.

In all three views the controls can be changed to be primarily mouse focused or a combined keyboard and mouse approach.\nThe story takes place in a medieval fantasy world and follows Geralt of Rivia, one of a few traveling monster hunters who have supernatural powers, known as Witchers. Players can choose one of three fighting styles to use in different situations and against different foes. The fast style allows for more rapid, less-damaging attacks with a higher chance of hitting faster enemies; the strong style deals more damage in exchange for a slow attack speed, and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; and the group style features sweeping attacks best used if Geralt is surrounded. The player can switch between the styles at any point. Both of Geralt's main swords also have distinctively different combat styles from other weaponry, and serve specific purposes. The steel blade is used to fight humans and other flesh-and-blood beings, while the silver sword is more effective against supernatural monsters and beasts (against some of which steel may have no effect whatsoever). With precise timing, the player can link Geralt's attacks into combos to damage enemies more effectively.\nAlchemy is a significant part of the gameplay. The player can create potions that increase health or endurance regeneration, allow Geralt to see in the dark, or provide other beneficial effects. The recipes for these potions can be learned through scrolls, or by experimentation. Once the player creates an unknown potion, he can choose to drink it, but if the potion is a failure it will poison or have other harmful effects on Geralt. Each time Geralt drinks potions, they increase the toxicity level of his body. This can be reduced by drinking a special potion or by meditating at an inn or fireplace.

It is based on the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, dystopic metropolis called Mega-City One that lies in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Dredd and his rookie partner, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey high-rise block of apartments and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).\nGarland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new Judge Dredd film adaptation, unrelated to the 1995 film Judge Dredd, was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio DNA Films, Dredd began principal photography, using 3D cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on practical sets and locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg.\nDredd was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action sequences, while criticism focused on excessive violence as well as a perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30\u201345 million. Dredd saw greater success following its home release and has since been recognised as a cult film.

Judge Dredd is tasked by the Chief Judge with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson, a powerful psychic who marginally failed the aptitude tests to become a Judge.\nIn a 200-storey slum tower block called Peach Trees, drug lord Madeline \"Ma-Ma\" Madrigal executes three rogue drug dealers by having them skinned alive. They are infused with Slo-Mo (an addictive new drug that reduces the user's perception of time to 1% of normal) and thrown down to the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay, whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one that carried out the executions, and Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building (closing its blast shield doors under the pretext of a security test) to prevent the Judges from leaving or summoning help.\nMa-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, forcing the Judges to fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with rotary cannons that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents.

He viewed the character as an average man with an insanely tough job in a fragmenting society and likened Dredd's heroism to that of a fireman. The role also demanded physical preparation; Urban undertook intensive physical training to become a \"beast of a man\". He also underwent weapons and technical training to learn how to operate under fire, arrest criminals and breach doors. He insisted on performing his own motorcycle stunts for the film.

Anderson can sense the thoughts and emotions of others. Thirlby contrasted her character with Dredd's \"black and white\" perspective, describing Anderson as existing \"in a grey area where everything is enhanced or clouded by the fact [that] she knows what is going on in the very interior of a person\". She undertook weapons and combat training, learning to perform a roundhouse kick to make her believably physically commanding.

Headey's performance was inspired by punk-rock singer Patti Smith. Reich described the character as someone who does \"not care at all about what anybody thinks or feels and she will do, and behave, as she wants\". Headey said: \"I think of [Ma-Ma] like an old great white shark who is just waiting for someone bigger and stronger to show up and kill her ... she's ready for it. In fact, she can't wait for it to happen ... She's an addict, so she's dead in that way, but that last knock just hasn't come.\" Before Headey's casting, the character was envisioned as a heavily made-up, scarred and obese older woman.\nWood Harris as Kay: Ma-Ma's clansman. Harris described the character as a villain, but one that sees himself as no worse than the Judges. Harris said: \" ... Dredd goes around literally judging and killing people if they do wrong ...

Anderson can sense the thoughts and emotions of others. Thirlby contrasted her character with Dredd's \"black and white\" perspective, describing Anderson as existing \"in a grey area where everything is enhanced or clouded by the fact [that] she knows what is going on in the very interior of a person\". She undertook weapons and combat training, learning to perform a roundhouse kick to make her believably physically commanding. The character was partially inspired by singer Debbie Harry.\nLena Headey as Madeline \"Ma-Ma\" Madrigal: A former prostitute turned drug lord and criminal kingpin who is the sole supplier of \"Slo-Mo\", a new and addictive drug. Headey's performance was inspired by punk-rock singer Patti Smith. Reich described the character as someone who does \"not care at all about what anybody thinks or feels and she will do, and behave, as she wants\". Headey said: \"I think of [Ma-Ma] like an old great white shark who is just waiting for someone bigger and stronger to show up and kill her ... she's ready for it. In fact, she can't wait for it to happen ... She's an addict, so she's dead in that way, but that last knock just hasn't come.\" Before Headey's casting, the character was envisioned as a heavily made-up, scarred and obese older woman.\nWood Harris as Kay: Ma-Ma's clansman. Harris described the character as a villain, but one that sees himself as no worse than the Judges. Harris said: \" ... Dredd goes around literally judging and killing people if they do wrong ... Anyone who goes against the system might end up the bad guy. So I think Kay has justified fighting that in his mind.\"The cast also includes: Domhnall Gleeson as the gang's unnamed computer expert; Warrick Grier as Ma-Ma's enforcer Caleb; DeObia Oparei as TJ, Peach Trees' medic; Francis Chouler as Judge Guthrie, Daniel Hadebe as Judge Volt, and Rakie Ayola as the Chief Judge. Langley Kirkwood, Edwin Perry, Karl Thaning, and Michele Levin portray, respectively, the corrupt Judges Lex, Alvarez, Chan, and Kaplan. Dredd also features Junior Singo as Amos and Luke Tyler as Freel, young boys who confront Dredd; Jason Cope as Zwirner, the thug executed by Dredd during the opening scene; Joe Vaz as Big Joe, the thug that leads the confrontation outside of the med station; Scott Sparrow as Japhet, Anderson's first execution; and Nicole Bailey as Cathy, Japhet's wife, in whose apartment the Judges take refuge.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and was released in October 2013 for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS in PAL regions by Nintendo and by Sega in North America and Japan. A port of the Wii U version for Windows was later released in November 2015.\nLost World focuses on the efforts of Sonic the Hedgehog to stop the Deadly Six, an alien tribe that serves as the game's main antagonists, as they seek to siphon the world's energy from the Lost Hex, the game's setting. Sonic and his long-time sidekick Tails must team up with Doctor Eggman, normally their enemy, to stop the Deadly Six, leading to conflicts among the three parties. While the gameplay is typical of the Sonic series in some ways, it adds parkour mechanics and features largely cylindrical level design with an emphasis on alternate pathways. The game also features the Wisp creatures from Sonic Colors as power-ups.\nThe game began development shortly after the 2010 release of Sonic Colors. It was designed to be streamlined and fluid in movement and design, using tube-like level design and a simple, bright color scheme. The game received mixed reviews upon release; its controls and the Deadly Six were frequently criticized, but its visuals and audio were seen positively. Downloadable content was released both alongside and after the game's release, adding features such as additional levels and a new type of Wisp power.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_5839", "text": "Sonic Lost World is a platform game with action-adventure elements, in which the player controls Sonic the Hedgehog as he travels across the Lost Hex in order to rescue captured animals and stop the Deadly Six. Levels range from side-scrolling 2D levels to fast-moving 3D linear levels to levels taking place on spherical worlds similar to the canceled Sonic X-treme and the Super Mario Galaxy series. This also translates to the 3DS version, as it was the first handheld game in the series presented entirely in 3D.\nThe game uses a new control system which allows players to control Sonic's speed. Simply moving the directional controls will move Sonic at a moderate pace, allowing for more precision. Holding down a trigger button will cause Sonic to sprint, allowing him to move faster and perform new parkour moves, such as running up and along walls and hopping over small ledges. In the air, Sonic can perform a double jump, which returns from Sonic Colors, a homing attack, which can now target multiple enemies in quick succession, and a new kick attack, which can be used to defeat stronger enemies, or knock them into others.\nAlso returning from Colors are the Wisp creatures, which provide short-lived power-ups to Sonic. The Wisps' powers are now controlled using the Wii U GamePad's touchscreen and gyroscopic features. Alongside returning powers such as Drill, Laser and Rocket, new powers include Eagle, which lets Sonic fly through the air, Asteroid, which atomizes objects in his path, and Rhythm, which lets him bounce along a path of notes. There are also some Wisps exclusive to each version of the game. During the game, players can rescue animals by destroying enemies or opening containers, allowing players to progress, or find Red Star Rings that open up circus-themed bonus stages where players can earn more animals. Collecting all the Red Star Rings in the game unlocks the ability to transform into Super Sonic.The Wii U version supports both co-operative multiplayer, in which a second player can control a remote controlled vehicle to assist Sonic, and competitive multiplayer, in which a second player can use the Wii U Gamepad screen to race against the other player. The game also supports Off-TV Play functionality and formerly Miiverse. Using Miiverse, players could exchange items such as Wisps or shields, which would grow more effective if they were used by other players.

Sonic Team sought to streamline the controls, increase the length, and add more diverse levels compared to previous entries in the series. After reviewing the history of the franchise with Sonic Generations, game producer Takashi Iizuka hoped to \"deliver a new experience\" with Sonic Lost World. Development started on PC, with early experiments involving \"twisted tube-type level[s]\" inspired by Jack and the Beanstalk. As the concept \"was totally new\", early levels had to be remade \"over and over.\" Players were given greater ability to control Sonic's speed in an effort to create a more traditional platforming experience. The parkour mechanic was introduced to maintain a more fluid sense of movement, in contrast to previous Sonic games where running into a wall would force the player to a complete stop. Iizuka stated that \"This game is like going into the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland, an action game where you can experience many strange and fun experiences.\"Development ultimately focused on the Wii U and 3DS because of the success of previous Sonic games on Nintendo platforms. Because Wii U \"has two monitors to use\", Sonic Team decided to include both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The Wii U GamePad's touch screen and gyroscope were employed to activate the returning Color Powers. The 3DS version, co-developed with Dimps, was designed to \"fully utilize\" the 3DS hardware with 3D gameplay and motion controls. Development was harder on 3DS due to its more limited processing power. Iizuka stated that the Color Powers are \"essential\" to the level design of the 3DS version, while they work as an \"additional tool\" in the Wii U version. A simple art style was used to make objects stand out more against the backgrounds, and to keep the game running at a consistent 60 frames per second. The design of the new \"Deadly Six\" villains was based on that of an ogre, and each one's appearance was intended to reflect a certain key characteristic of their personality, which the developers hoped players could see \"just by looking at them.\" The Wii U version of the game was directed by Morio Kishimoto, the director of Sonic Colors and the lead designer of Sonic and the Black Knight, while the 3DS version was directed by Takao Hirabayashi, the director of Sonic Colors DS, and previously lead designer of Sonic Unleashed PS2/Wii.Sega trademarked the title Sonic Lost World in May 2013. The game was revealed on May 17, 2013, in a Nintendo Direct announcement, as part of an exclusive partnership between Sega and Nintendo for the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It is one of three games in this partnership, the other ones being the fourth entry to the Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series, and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal, a game based on the Sonic Boom animated series. Sega reported that more on the game would be revealed before E3 2013, and that the game would contain both returning and new original characters, both in enemies and friends of Sonic. The first trailer for the game was released on May 28, a day earlier than previously announced. A downloadable demo of the game's first stage was made available for both consoles on October 9 in Japan and in mid-November in North America and Europe. To promote the release of Sonic Lost World, Hardlight released an update for Sonic Dash that includes a boss battle against Zazz, one of the Deadly Six. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U also includes a stage based on Windy Hill Zone from the game.\nThe soundtrack was composed and directed by Tomoya Ohtani, with Takahito Eguchi handling the orchestration and cutscene music.

Although wuxia is traditionally a form of historical fantasy literature, its popularity has caused it to be adapted for such diverse art forms as Chinese opera, manhua, television dramas, films, and video games. It forms part of popular culture in many Chinese-speaking communities around the world. According to Hong Kong film director, producer, and movie writer Ronny Yu, wuxia movies are not to be confused with martial arts movies.The word \"w\u01d4xi\u00e1\" is a compound composed of the elements w\u01d4 (\u6b66, literally \"martial\", \"military\", or \"armed\") and xi\u00e1 (\u4fe0, literally \"chivalrous\", \"vigilante\" or \"hero\"). A martial artist who follows the code of xia is often referred to as a xi\u00e1k\u00e8 (\u4fe0\u5ba2, literally \"follower of xia\") or y\u00f3uxi\u00e1 (\u904a\u4fe0, literally \"wandering xia\").

They often originate from the lower social classes of ancient Chinese society. A code of chivalry usually requires wuxia heroes to right and redress wrongs, fight for righteousness, remove oppressors, and bring retribution for past misdeeds.

At the end of the story, he emerges as a powerful fighter whom few can equal. He uses his abilities to follow the code of xia and mends the ills of the jianghu.

Gore believed that \"Peace\" is one of the best songs he had ever written.

In May 2008, the band went to the studio to record their twelfth studio album. Ben Hillier took the production reins again, because the band were so satisfied with their previous collaboration on Playing the Angel (2005). As with their previous album Playing the Angel, Gahan once again wrote three songs with Christian Eigner and Andrew Phillpott: \"Hole to Feed\", \"Come Back\", and \"Miles Away/The Truth Is\". Gore shares lead vocal duties with Gahan on \"In Chains\", \"Hole to Feed\", \"Peace\", and \"Little Soul\". The band described the time in the studio as very productive, a total of 22 songs were created and it was difficult to choose the right songs for the album. Five of the songs not used on the album were released as part of the deluxe box set. Short video clips of the band and production team at work in the studio were regularly posted on the band's homepage. This would be the first time that the band would openly post detailed clips of their recording process on social media.\nLyrically, this album has a good amount of personal lyrics. Gahan explained that the song \"Hole to Feed\" was written about the desire to fill a metaphorical hole but not knowing what to fill it up with. The song \"Wrong\" was described by Gore to have a bit of black humor in its lyrics but doesn't want people to find it depressing. Gore believed that \"Peace\" is one of the best songs he had ever written. Even though the track \"Miles Away/The Truth Is\" is not inherently about drugs, Gahan feels like that subject is always present in his songs due to his past substance abuse.Musically, the album has a heavy use of analog synthesizers giving it a more traditional electronic sound. The opening track \"In Chains\" opens with synthesizers tuning up. \"Wrong\" was chosen to be the first single off the album since the band felt it sounded very different.

It was released by Warner Music Finland digitally on 31 March 2010, with the official physical release following on 14 April. From 31 March to the official physical release date, the album was sold at \u20ac19 in conjunction with Ilta-Sanomat. The album was re-released on 14 January 2011, in a limited vinyl edition. The Finnish-language album, incorporating electro and synthpop elements along with melancholic piano ballads, is named after the island Seili (Sj\u00e4l\u00f6 in Swedish), located off the south-west coast of Finland. The album was produced and co-written by Jukka Immonen with Vartiainen writing also two of the songs. The main lyricists were Teemu Brunila and Mariska who contributed to the thematical dualism of the album\u2014Brunila wrote the happier songs about publicity and finding love while Mariska wrote the lyrics for the songs that deal with darker and more serious themes, such as death. Another lyricist was Paula Vesala (from the pop rock duo PMMP). Vartiainen participated more in the production than with her debut album Ihmisten edess\u00e4, by playing for example piano and kantele.\nCritically acclaimed for its vocals and successful combination of ballads and pop, though criticized for lack of peculiarity and a somewhat inconsistent song selection, Seili spent 62 non-consecutive weeks on the Finnish Albums Chart since its release\u2014with 15 weeks atop the chart\u2014and sold over 95,000 copies in 2010, becoming the best-selling album of 2010 in Finland. Altogether, Seili has sold over 150,000 copies since its release and currently ranks 14th in the list of the best-selling albums of all time in Finland. The album received three Emma Awards in February 2011: for Album of the Year, Pop/Rock Album of the Year and Best-Selling Album of the Year. The album included also two Emma-winning songs, the gold-selling singles \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\" and \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\", winning in the categories Song of the Year and Music Video of the Year, respectively. \"Nettiin\" was released as the third single and the album spawned two promotional singles, \"Duran Duran\", which sold also gold, and \"Eik\u00f6 kukaan voi meit\u00e4 pelastaa?\". \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\" was the major chart hit, dominating the top-three spots of the Finnish Singles Chart from August 2010 to January 2011 and becoming the third-best-selling single of 2011 in Finland. To promote the album, Vartiainen embarked on a concert tour titled Seili, spanning from April 2010 to August 2011 and consisting of 170 shows.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_5985", "text": "Thematically more polarized than its predecessor Ihmisten edess\u00e4, Seili has been described as being based on contrasts as it deals with both darker and happier themes and combines elements of classical music with pop and schlager melodies with rock. Vartiainen has said the overall inspiration for the album came from the imagery of the movie Blade Runner and songs from the 1980s she used in her programs during her figure skating career. The name of the album symbolizes \"a trip to an unknown island, an escape from normal life to the world of music\" and the content of the album places \"during the dramatical moments between 3 am and 5 am\" when a day ends a new one begins and people are, as Vartiainen has put it, \"sensitive to new ideas\", due to either fatigue or intoxication. Vartiainen attributes the dualistic nature of the album to her professional relation with the lyricists Mariska and Teemu Brunila, who Vartiainen is also friends with, saying \"Mariska knows well Vartiainen's darker, more philosophical side\". In an interview with Dome.fi in March 2010, Vartiainen said that while Mariska represents the dark and serious themes such as death, Brunila with his lyrical products \"goes towards the light\" and that the point in the album is \"to reflect on life and death\". Along with the two thematical polarities, the album deals also with tricky relationships and hunger for fame, as showcased by the Western-sounding \"Nettiin\", which starts with a banjo and a bass and is literally about naked pictures, taken and publicized by an ex-boyfriend, and paratextually about the line between privacy and publicity.The album introduces also more instruments than Ihmisten edess\u00e4; Vartiainen starts the album by playing piano in the dark introitus \"Koti\" (Home). The second song \"Seili\" is also dark-themed\u2014the song is about the namesake island located in the archipelago off the coast of Turku where leprotic and mentally ill patients were sent from 17th century onwards, along with boards they could build their own coffins with. The third song and the lead single \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\"\u2014in English, I Don't Wanna Die Tonight\u2014goes on with the theme, though with an electronic dance beat that \"emphasizes the will to live\". The fifth song and the third single \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\" (Where My Sweetheart Is) was written by Mariska who got the inspiration for the song while reading Indian erotic literature on her balcony on a hot summer's day.

Vartiainen has said the overall inspiration for the album came from the imagery of the movie Blade Runner and songs from the 1980s she used in her programs during her figure skating career. The name of the album symbolizes \"a trip to an unknown island, an escape from normal life to the world of music\" and the content of the album places \"during the dramatical moments between 3 am and 5 am\" when a day ends a new one begins and people are, as Vartiainen has put it, \"sensitive to new ideas\", due to either fatigue or intoxication. Vartiainen attributes the dualistic nature of the album to her professional relation with the lyricists Mariska and Teemu Brunila, who Vartiainen is also friends with, saying \"Mariska knows well Vartiainen's darker, more philosophical side\". In an interview with Dome.fi in March 2010, Vartiainen said that while Mariska represents the dark and serious themes such as death, Brunila with his lyrical products \"goes towards the light\" and that the point in the album is \"to reflect on life and death\". Along with the two thematical polarities, the album deals also with tricky relationships and hunger for fame, as showcased by the Western-sounding \"Nettiin\", which starts with a banjo and a bass and is literally about naked pictures, taken and publicized by an ex-boyfriend, and paratextually about the line between privacy and publicity.The album introduces also more instruments than Ihmisten edess\u00e4; Vartiainen starts the album by playing piano in the dark introitus \"Koti\" (Home). The second song \"Seili\" is also dark-themed\u2014the song is about the namesake island located in the archipelago off the coast of Turku where leprotic and mentally ill patients were sent from 17th century onwards, along with boards they could build their own coffins with. The third song and the lead single \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\"\u2014in English, I Don't Wanna Die Tonight\u2014goes on with the theme, though with an electronic dance beat that \"emphasizes the will to live\". The fifth song and the third single \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\" (Where My Sweetheart Is) was written by Mariska who got the inspiration for the song while reading Indian erotic literature on her balcony on a hot summer's day.

Paranoid was recorded at Regent Sound Studios and Island Studios in London, England.The album's title track was written as an afterthought. As drummer Bill Ward explains: \"We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony [Iommi] just played the guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom.\" In the liner notes to the 1998 live album Reunion, bassist Geezer Butler recounts to Phil Alexander that they wrote the song \"in five minutes, then I sat down and wrote the lyrics as quickly as I could. It was all done in about two hours.\" According to Alexander, \"Paranoid\" \"crystallized the band's writing process, with Iommi initiating the ideas with his charred riffs, Ozzy [Osbourne] working on a melody, Geezer providing drive and the majority of the lyrics, and Bill Ward locking into a set of often pounding rhythms beneath Butler's bass rumble.\" The single was released in August 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit.Most of the songs on Paranoid evolved during onstage improvisational jams. In the Classic Albums documentary on the making of Paranoid, guitarist Tony Iommi recalls that \"War Pigs\" came from \"one of the clubs\" with Butler adding, \"During the song \"Warning\" we used to jam that out and that particular night when we were jamming it out Tony just went da-dum!\" In the same documentary, Iommi demonstrates his approach to the guitar solo in the song, explaining that \"I always tried to keep the bottom string ringing so it fills it out nicely.\" On \"Planet Caravan\", Osbourne sings through a Leslie speaker, with the singer telling Mojo in 2010, \"Then Rodger Bain used an oscillator on it \u2013 whatever that is. It looks like a fridge with a knob on.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_6043", "text": "The album's opening track \"War Pigs\" was originally intended to be called \"Walpurgis\". It was then changed to \"War Pigs\", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that the song of the same name had potential as a single. Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: \"I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' \u2013 you know, the Satanic version of Christmas \u2013 write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'.\" In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, \"It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis' ... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song ... Geezer also liked to put a lot of topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did.\"\nThe song \"Iron Man\" was originally entitled \"Iron Bloke\". Upon hearing Iommi play the main guitar riff for the first time, Osbourne remarked in awe that it sounded \"like a big iron bloke walking around\". The title was later changed to \"Iron Man\" as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. The riff to \"Iron Man\" is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that \"...Tony Iommi turned out to be one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff \u2013 and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away.\" Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. His attempts to warn the populace are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and vengeful, causing the destruction seen in his vision. \"Electric Funeral\" also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands \"it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life.\"In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne said: \"It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday ... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet.'\" \"You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world,\" Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, \"and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about \u2013 political stuff \u2013 so that's what inspired me.\"In 2013, Butler told Mojo magazine that the song \"Paranoid\" was \"about depression, because I didn't really know the difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards.\" In 2015, Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: \"I used to be a cutter.

Paranoid was recorded at Regent Sound Studios and Island Studios in London, England.The album's title track was written as an afterthought. As drummer Bill Ward explains: \"We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony [Iommi] just played the guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom.\" In the liner notes to the 1998 live album Reunion, bassist Geezer Butler recounts to Phil Alexander that they wrote the song \"in five minutes, then I sat down and wrote the lyrics as quickly as I could. It was all done in about two hours.\" According to Alexander, \"Paranoid\" \"crystallized the band's writing process, with Iommi initiating the ideas with his charred riffs, Ozzy [Osbourne] working on a melody, Geezer providing drive and the majority of the lyrics, and Bill Ward locking into a set of often pounding rhythms beneath Butler's bass rumble.\" The single was released in August 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit.Most of the songs on Paranoid evolved during onstage improvisational jams. In the Classic Albums documentary on the making of Paranoid, guitarist Tony Iommi recalls that \"War Pigs\" came from \"one of the clubs\" with Butler adding, \"During the song \"Warning\" we used to jam that out and that particular night when we were jamming it out Tony just went da-dum!\" In the same documentary, Iommi demonstrates his approach to the guitar solo in the song, explaining that \"I always tried to keep the bottom string ringing so it fills it out nicely.\" On \"Planet Caravan\", Osbourne sings through a Leslie speaker, with the singer telling Mojo in 2010, \"Then Rodger Bain used an oscillator on it \u2013 whatever that is. It looks like a fridge with a knob on.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_6043", "text": "The album's opening track \"War Pigs\" was originally intended to be called \"Walpurgis\". It was then changed to \"War Pigs\", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that the song of the same name had potential as a single. Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: \"I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' \u2013 you know, the Satanic version of Christmas \u2013 write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'.\" In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, \"It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis' ... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song ... Geezer also liked to put a lot of topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did.\"\nThe song \"Iron Man\" was originally entitled \"Iron Bloke\". Upon hearing Iommi play the main guitar riff for the first time, Osbourne remarked in awe that it sounded \"like a big iron bloke walking around\". The title was later changed to \"Iron Man\" as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. The riff to \"Iron Man\" is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that \"...Tony Iommi turned out to be one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff \u2013 and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away.\" Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. His attempts to warn the populace are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and vengeful, causing the destruction seen in his vision. \"Electric Funeral\" also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands \"it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life.\"In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne said: \"It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday ... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet.'\" \"You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world,\" Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, \"and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about \u2013 political stuff \u2013 so that's what inspired me.\"In 2013, Butler told Mojo magazine that the song \"Paranoid\" was \"about depression, because I didn't really know the difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards.\" In 2015, Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: \"I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. I used to get really depressed and it was the only thing that could bring me out of it.

{"id": "407_177", "question": "Which language was Finnish name written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_6049", "text": "In Finland, a person must have a surname and at least one given name with up to three given names permitted. Surnames are inherited either patrilineally or matrilineally, while given names are usually chosen by a person's parents. Finnish names come from a variety of dissimilar traditions that were consolidated only in the early 20th century. The first national act on names came into force in 1921, and it made surnames mandatory. Between 1930 and 1985, the Western Finnish tradition whereby a married woman took her husband's surname was mandatory. Previously in Eastern Finland, this was not necessarily the case. On 1 January 2019, the reformed Act on Forenames and Surnames came into force.Finnish given names are often of Christian origin (e.g., Jukka from Greek Johannes), but Finnish and Swedish origins are also common.\nIn Finnish, the letter \"j\" denotes the approximant [j], as in English you. For example, the two different names Maria and Marja are pronounced nearly identically. The letter \"y\" denotes the vowel [y], not found in English, but similar to German \"\u00fc\" and French \"u\". \"R\" is rolled. The stress is always on the first syllable in Finnish. For example, Yrj\u00f6 K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen is pronounced [\u02c8yrj\u00f8 \u02c8k\u00e6\u02d0ri\u00e6i\u032fnen]. Double letters always stand for a geminate or longer sound (e.g., Marjaana has a stressed short [\u0251] followed by an unstressed long [\u0251\u02d0] and then another unstressed short [\u0251]). As per Finnish phonotactics, both Finnish first names and surnames usually end in vowels, and always in either a vowel or a coronal consonant. This occurs regardless of gender, and surnames are no longer marked by gender.\nPronunciation of Swedish names is similar, but long vowels are not doubled and the stress may be on any syllable. Finland has a long bilingual history and it is not unusual for Finnish speakers to have Swedish surnames or given names. Such names may be pronounced according to Finland\u2013Swedish phonology or, depending on the person named, the person speaking and the language used, a Fennicized variant.\nWhen writing Finnish names without the Finnish alphabet available (such as in e-mail addresses), the letters \"\u00e4\" and \"\u00f6\" are usually replaced with \"a\" and \"o\", respectively (e.g., P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen as Paakkonen). This is not the same, but visually recognizable.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6050", "text": "Finland has three predominant surname traditions: the West Finnish, the East Finnish and that of the Swedish nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie and military. Until the early 20th century, Finland was a predominantly agrarian society and the names of West Finns were based on their association with a particular area, farm, or homestead (e.g. Jaakko Jussila 'Jaakko from the place of Jussi'). Farm names typically had the suffix -la, -l\u00e4, i.e. \"(place) of\", and could refer to the husband (like Jussila) or describe the location (e.g. Isoaho 'large clearing'). This name could change every time the person moved to a different farm. Multiple names could be recorded in documents, such that for example Pentti Jussila l. Penttil\u00e4 would be a person named Pentti who had moved from Jussila farm to Penttil\u00e4 farm. Also, even if one had a surname, one would still be better known by the farm name. Farm names, patronyms and village names could be used to disambiguate between different people, but they were not true inherited surnames. For example, in Aleksis Kivi's novel Seven Brothers (1870) the character Juhani was officially summoned as Juhani Juhanin-poika Jukola, Toukolan kyl\u00e4st\u00e4, in English 'Juhani, son of Juhani, from Jukola farm, Toukola village'.\nOn the other hand, the East Finnish surname tradition dates back to the 13th century. There, the Savonians pursued slash-and-burn agriculture which necessitated moving several times during a person's lifetime. This in turn required the families to have surnames, which were in wide use among the common folk as early as the 13th century. By the mid-16th century, the East Finnish surnames had become hereditary. Typically, the oldest East Finnish surnames were formed from the first names of the patriarchs of the families (e.g. Ik\u00e4valko, Termonen, Pentik\u00e4inen). In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, new names were most often formed by adding the place name of the former or current place of residence (e.g., Puumalainen < \"of Puumala\"). In the East Finnish tradition, women carried the family name of their fathers in feminine form indicated by the -tar suffix (e.g. Puumalatar < Puumalainen). By the 19th century, this practice fell into disuse due to the influence of Western European surname tradition. Also, women did not change their surnames with marriage.\nIn 1921, surnames became compulsory for all Finns. At this point, if there was no surname, the homestead names were usually adopted as surnames. Because the inhabitants often included farmhands and other non-family member, holders of the same surname are not necessarily genetically related. A typical feature of such names is the addition of prefixes Ala- or Ali- ('Lower') and Yl\u00e4- or Yli- ('Upper'), giving the location of the holding along a waterway in relation to the main holding (e.g. Yli-Ojanper\u00e4, Ala-Verronen). In Pohjanmaa, there are similar prefixes Rinta- and Latva- ('downstream' and 'upstream' respectively).\nCommon suffixes are -nen (in oblique form -se-; e.g., Miettinen : Miettisen \"Miettinen's\"), a diminutive suffix usually meaning \"small\", and -la/-l\u00e4, a locative suffix usually meaning \"(place) of\". The -nen suffix was freely interchanged with -son or -poika as late as the 16th century, but its meaning was ambiguous as it could refer not only to a \"son\", but any member of a patriarch's family, a farm or even a place. For example, the surname Tuomonen could mean \"Son of Tuomo\" or \"Farm of Tuomo\" or something else belonging to Tuomo.\nA third tradition of surnames was introduced into Finland by the Swedish-speaking upper and middle classes which used typical German and Swedish surnames. By custom, all Finnish-speaking people who were able to get a position of some status in urban or learned society, discarded their Finnish name, adopting a Swedish, German or (in case of clergy) a Latin surname. In the case of enlisted soldiers, the new name was given regardless of the wishes of the individual. The oldest noble surnames of Swedish origin were not original, but were derived from the charges in the coat of arms, sigil and flag of the family, for example with Sv\u00e4rd (Swedish: \"sword\"), Kurki/Kurck (Finnish: \"crane\") and Kirves (Finnish: \"axe\").  Families of German origin would use the von suffix (e.g., von Wright).\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the overall modernization process and especially, the political movement of Fennicization brought forth a movement towards the adoption of Finnish surnames. At that time, many people with a Swedish or otherwise foreign surname changed their family name to a Finnish one. The features of nature with endings -o/\u00f6, -nen (Meri\u00f6 < meri \"sea\", Nieminen < niemi \"peninsula\") are typical of the names of this era, as well as more or less direct translations of Swedish names (Helleranta < H\u00e4llstrand). Fennicizing one's name also concealed non-Finnish origin. For example, Martti Ahtisaari's grandfather was Adolfsen from Norway. Nevertheless, Fennicization was not mandatory and thus it is common to find entirely Finnish-speaking families with Swedish surnames; having a Swedish name does not imply one is a Swedish speaker.\nAn effect of industrialization was that large numbers of people moved to the cities and towns and had to adopt a surname. Missing an inherited surname, they invented theirs. Initially, these were in Swedish, and they were not very stable; people called them \"superfluous names\" (liikanimi), and a person could change one's surname several times during their career. Later, Finnish became the preferred language, and themes were taken from nature. Some of the most common examples of this type are Laine \"wave\", Vainio \"cultivated field\", Nurmi \"grassland\", and Salo \"grove\". When applicable, -nen or -la/-l\u00e4 could be suffixed, such as in Koskinen \"rapids + nen\".\nSharing a surname does not imply that the two people are related. Regulation of surnames to prevent two families from sharing the same name only began with the 1921 act. Before this, multiple families could have had Fennicized or otherwise changed their surnames to the same name. For example, the Finnish name Rautavaara was adopted by persons with the former Swedish names Sirius, Rosenqvist, Backman, J\u00e4rnberg, Granlund and Mattson.

Edited by Hassan Ngeze, the magazine was a response to the RPF-sponsored Kanguka, adopting a similar informal style.  \"Kangura\" was a Rwandan word meaning \"wake others up\", as opposed to \"Kanguka\", which meant \"wake up\".  The journal was based in Gisenyi.\nThe magazine was the print equivalent to the later-established Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM), publishing articles harshly critical of the RPF and of Tutsis generally.

They were joined later by the American producer Rich Costey, who produced the rest of the album. Costey had worked with acts Muse admired, including Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, and wanted to help them find a bigger, more aggressive sound. According to Costey, Muse wanted to sound like a \"colossal, dynamic, epic and powerful rock band\".Muse and Costey returned to Air in late 2002 to work on songs including \"Hysteria\" and  \"Stockholm Syndrome\". The songwriter, Matt Bellamy, restructured \"Hysteria\" after feedback from Costey. For \"Stockholm Syndrome\", Costey vocodered Bellamy's guitar with a Nord modular synthesiser, creating \"hollow, white noisey\" sound. Muse and Costey regrouped in early 2003 for 10 days at Livingston Recording Studios, London, completing the recordings they had made at Air. They then moved to Grouse Lodge, a residential recording studio in County Westmeath, Ireland, where most of the album was recorded.The Grouse Lodge sessions were marred by Muse's strained relationship with their record company. When Muse's co-manager arrived to review their progress, they found him disruptive and threw them out of the studio. They also became involved in a lawsuit with their production company. Bellamy said later that \"there was a genuine sense of impending doom for the band\". The bassist, Chris Wolstenholme, an alcoholic, drank extensively during the sessions.\nTo create basic tracks, the band recorded together live, then focused on overdubs. Costey minimised editing to preserve the \"human touch\" and avoid an artificial result. He added little reverb, preferring to use the natural ambience recorded by the microphones.

Muse and Costey used the sound design system Kyma to process elements of many tracks, including \"Time is Running Out\", \"Hysteria\" and \"Apocalypse Please\". Bellamy said Kyma added an \"outrageously hi-fi and bright and futuristic sound\"; Costey described it as \"the sound of the record\".\nThe group experimented with drum sounds, using a number of microphones. For the introduction to \"Apocalypse Please\", they recorded two large kick drums in the Grouse Lodge swimming pool. They also recorded Wolstenholme diving into the pool, which was used in the bridge of \"Thoughts of a Dying Atheist\". For \"Ruled By Secrecy\", they recorded a drum take in the courtyard outdoors, hoping to capture an unusual ambience, but discarded the results.

Costey recorded Bellamy's left and right-hand parts separately, and processed them using guitar amps and an Echoplex. \"Time is Running Out\" was the most difficult song to record; the band spent hours working on the bass sound for the introduction, processing Wolstenholme's bass with multiple effects.

It is among his most acclaimed compositions.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6188", "text": "Before Le Marteau, Boulez had established a reputation as the composer of modernist and serialist works such as Structures I, Polyphonie X, as well as his infamously \"unplayable\" Second Piano Sonata. Le Marteau was first written as a six-movement composition between 1953 and 1954, and was published in that form in the latter year, \"imprim\u00e9e pour le festival de musique, 1954, Donaueschingen\" (though in the end it was not performed there) in a photographic reproduction of the composer's manuscript by Universal Edition, given the catalog number UE 12362.\nIn 1955 Boulez revised the order of these movements and interpolated three newly composed ones. The original, six-movement form lacked the two \"Bel \u00c9difice\" settings and the third commentaire on \"Bourreaux de solitude\". In addition, the movements were grouped in two closed cycles: first the three \"Artisanat furieux\" movements, then the three \"Bourreaux de solitude\" ones, otherwise in the order of the final score. The first movement, though fundamentally the same composition, was originally scored as a duet for vibraphone and guitar\u2014the flute and viola were added only in the revision\u2014and numerous less significant alterations were made to playing techniques and notation in the other movements.It received its premi\u00e8re in 1955 at the 29th Festival of the International Society for Contemporary Music in Baden-Baden. Boulez's work was chosen to represent France at this festival.

The original, six-movement form lacked the two \"Bel \u00c9difice\" settings and the third commentaire on \"Bourreaux de solitude\".

Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger in late 1922. The first issue, dated March 1923, appeared on newsstands February 18. The first editor, Edwin Baird, printed early work by H. P. Lovecraft, Seabury Quinn, and Clark Ashton Smith, all of whom went on to be popular writers, but within a year, the magazine was in financial trouble.  Henneberger sold his interest in the publisher, Rural Publishing Corporation, to Lansinger, and refinanced Weird Tales, with Farnsworth Wright as the new editor.  The first issue to list Wright as editor was dated November 1924.  The magazine was more successful under Wright, and despite occasional financial setbacks, it prospered over the next 15 years.  Under Wright's control, the magazine lived up to its subtitle, \"The Unique Magazine\", and published a wide range of unusual fiction.\nLovecraft's Cthulhu mythos stories first appeared in Weird Tales, starting with \"The Call of Cthulhu\" in 1928.  These were well-received, and a group of writers associated with Lovecraft wrote other stories set in the same milieu.  Robert E. Howard was a regular contributor, and published several of his Conan the Barbarian stories in the magazine, and Seabury Quinn's series of stories about Jules de Grandin, a detective who specialized in cases involving the supernatural, was very popular with the readers.  Other well-liked authors included Nictzin Dyalhis, E. Hoffmann Price, Robert Bloch, and H. Warner Munn.  Wright published some science fiction, along with the fantasy and horror, partly because when Weird Tales was launched,  no magazines were specializing in science fiction, but he continued this policy even after the launch of magazines such as Amazing Stories in 1926.  Edmond Hamilton wrote a good deal of science fiction for Weird Tales, though after a few years, he used the magazine for his more fantastic stories, and submitted his space operas elsewhere.\nIn 1938, the magazine was sold to William Delaney, the publisher of Short Stories, and within two years, Wright, who was ill, was replaced by Dorothy McIlwraith as editor.  Although some successful new authors and artists, such as Ray Bradbury and Hannes Bok, continued to appear, the magazine is considered by critics to have declined under McIlwraith from its heyday in the 1930s.  Weird Tales ceased publication in 1954, but since then, numerous attempts have been made to relaunch the magazine, starting in 1973.  The longest-lasting version began in 1988 and ran with an occasional hiatus for over 20 years under an assortment of publishers. In the mid-1990s, the title was changed to Worlds of Fantasy and Horror because of licensing issues, the original title returning in 1998.\nThe magazine is regarded by historians of fantasy and science fiction as a legend in the field, Robert Weinberg considering it \"the most important and influential of all fantasy magazines\".  Weinberg's fellow historian, Mike Ashley, describes it as \"second only to Unknown in significance and influence\", adding that \"somewhere in the imagination reservoir of all U.S. (and many non-U.S.) genre-fantasy and horror writers is part of the spirit of Weird Tales\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6319", "text": "In the late 19th century, popular magazines typically did not print fiction to the exclusion of other content; they would include nonfiction articles and poetry, as well.

It launched in April 2008 and switched to online-only distribution in January 2009 after having published a total of ten issues. The magazine continued online until 2020, when that year's edition of its Faces series prominently mentioned the website having ceased publication.It enjoyed a good run and was voted Best Music Site in 2008 and Best Web Publication in 2010 in the Irish Web Awards. Originally, the concept of the magazine involved a hard copy of which there was a charge to purchase. However after six issues it was decided to make the magazine's content free both online and in print. The first issue, April 2008, appeared on Irish shelves on 6 March 2008 and featured Michael Stipe of R.E.M. on the cover. This immediately garnered comparisons between the new magazine's similarities with Hot Press who featured Stipe on their cover at the same time, a move widely thought to be an attempt by Hot Press to stifle State's status as a serious 'alternative' to the more established local magazine. At a price of \u20ac5.50, State charged \u20ac2 more than Hot Press.State was published by Roger Woolman and edited by Hot Press alumni Phil Udell.

The dialogue is overheard by a troubled writer who has lain down near the graves.\nThe title \"Bobok\" refers to a nonsensical utterance repeatedly made by one of the cemetery's residents, an almost completely decomposed corpse who is otherwise silent. The writer also reports a kind of auditory hallucination of the word prior to his hearing of the dialogue. The sound suggests \"little bean\" in Russian, but in the context of the story is taken to be synonymous with gibberish.The philosopher and literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin regarded Bobok as one of the finest works in the literary tradition of Menippean satire, and argues that it encapsulates many of the thematic concerns of Dostoevsky's major novels.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6331", "text": "The story begins with a stream of short, self-referring internal polemics with various individuals and points of view by a frustrated writer called Ivan Ivanovich.

The Venetian word for \"slave\", s-ci\u00e0o [\u02c8st\u0283ao] or s-ci\u00e0vo, derives from Medieval Latin sclavus, a loanword from Medieval Greek \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, related to the ethnic \"Slavic\", since most of the slaves at that time came from the Balkans.This greeting was eventually shortened to ci\u00e0o, lost all its servile connotations and came to be used as an informal salutation by speakers of all classes.  In modern Italian language, the word is used (in addition to the meaning of salutation) as an exclamation of resignation (also in a positive sense), as in Oh, va be', ciao!

The Venetian word for \"slave\", s-ci\u00e0o [\u02c8st\u0283ao] or s-ci\u00e0vo, derives from Medieval Latin sclavus, a loanword from Medieval Greek \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, related to the ethnic \"Slavic\", since most of the slaves at that time came from the Balkans.This greeting was eventually shortened to ci\u00e0o, lost all its servile connotations and came to be used as an informal salutation by speakers of all classes.  In modern Italian language, the word is used (in addition to the meaning of salutation) as an exclamation of resignation (also in a positive sense), as in Oh, va be', ciao! (\"Oh, well, never mind!\"). A Milanese tongue-twister says Se gh'hinn gh'hinn; se gh'hinn n\u00f2, s'ci\u00e0o (\"If there is [money], there is; if there isn't, farewell! [there's nothing we can do]\").", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_6380", "text": "The Venetian ci\u00e0o was adopted by Northern Italian people during the late 19th and early 20th century. Later it became common elsewhere in Italy with the spelling ciao. It has since spread to many countries in Europe, along with other items of the Italian culture. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the greeting (spelled chau and only meaning 'bye') spread to the Americas\u2014especially Colombia, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Brazil (as tchau), Venezuela, Panama and Argentina \u2013 largely by way of Italian immigrants. In today's Cuba, ciao as a closing in letters has largely replaced the more traditional adi\u00f3s, with its religious implications, for many young people. Ciao has also permeated Australian culture, becoming a popular greeting among descendants of Italian immigrants. It is also common in some varieties of South African English. Ciao has also been used in some parts of Romania as a way to say 'goodbye'.\nErnest Hemingway's novel A Farewell to Arms (1929), which is set in northeast Italy during World War I, is credited with bringing the word into the English language.", "hasanswer": false}]}

With their producer, Nigel Godrich, Radiohead recorded most of OK Computer in their rehearsal space in Oxfordshire and the historic mansion of St Catherine's Court in Bath in 1996 and early 1997. They distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work.\nThe album's lyrics depict a dystopian, futuristic world fraught with rampant consumerism, capitalism, social and modern alienation, emotional isolation and political malaise, with overall themes like transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism; in this capacity, OK Computer is said to have prescient insight into the mood of 21st-century life. The band used unconventional production techniques, including natural reverberation, and no audio separation. Strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Most of the album was recorded live.\nDespite lowered sales estimates by EMI, who deemed the record uncommercial and difficult to market, OK Computer reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and debuted at number 21 on the Billboard 200, Radiohead's highest album entry on the US charts at the time, and was soon certified five times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. \"Paranoid Android\", \"Karma Police\", \"Lucky\" and \"No Surprises\" were released as singles. The album expanded Radiohead's international popularity and has sold at least 7.8 million units worldwide.\nOK Computer received acclaim and has been cited as one of the greatest albums of all time. It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Alternative Music Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album initiated a stylistic shift in British rock away from Britpop toward melancholic, atmospheric alternative rock that became more prevalent in the next decade. In 2014, it was included by the United States Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A remastered version with additional tracks, OKNOTOK 1997 2017, was released in 2017, marking the album's twentieth anniversary.

Midway through the tour, Brian Eno commissioned them to contribute a song to The Help Album, a charity compilation organised by War Child; the album was to be recorded over the course of a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded \"Lucky\" in five hours with Nigel Godrich, who had engineered The Bends and produced several Radiohead B-sides. Godrich said of the session: \"Those things are the most inspiring, when you do stuff really fast and there's nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric. So after establishing a bit of a rapport work-wise, I was sort of hoping I would be involved with the next album.\" The singer, Thom Yorke, said \"Lucky\" shaped the nascent sound and mood of their upcoming record: \"'Lucky' was indicative of what we wanted to do.

The lead guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, said \"the only concept that we had for this album was that we wanted to record it away from the city and that we wanted to record it ourselves\". According to the guitarist Ed O'Brien, \"Everyone said, 'You'll sell six or seven million if you bring out The Bends Pt 2,' and we're like, 'We'll kick against that and do the opposite'.\" A number of producers were suggested, including major figures such as Scott Litt, but Radiohead were encouraged by their sessions with Godrich.

In July, they began rehearsing and recording in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline that contributed to the stress of The Bends, the band had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: \"We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song ... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them.\"The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly \"the loudest voice\", according to O'Brien. Selway said \"we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, but at the same time we are all very critical about what the other person is doing.\" Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead \"need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well ...

It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across.\" Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's \"sixth member\", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the \"fifth Beatle\".Radiohead decided that Canned Applause was an unsatisfactory recording location, which Yorke attributed to its proximity to the band members' homes, and Jonny Greenwood attributed to its lack of dining and bathroom facilities. The group had nearly completed four songs: \"Electioneering\", \"No Surprises\", \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and \"The Tourist\". They took a break from recording to embark on an American tour in 1996, opening for Alanis Morissette, performing early versions of several new songs.During the tour, Baz Luhrmann commissioned Radiohead to write a song for his upcoming film Romeo + Juliet and gave them the final 30 minutes of the film. Yorke said: \"When we saw the scene in which Claire Danes holds the Colt .45 against her head, we started working on the song immediately.\" Soon afterwards, the band wrote and recorded \"Exit Music (For a Film)\"; the track plays over the film's end credits but was excluded from the soundtrack album at the band's request. The song helped shape the direction of the rest of the album. Yorke said it \"was the first performance we'd ever recorded where every note of it made my head spin\u2014something I was proud of, something I could turn up really, really loud and not wince at any moment.\"\nRadiohead resumed recording in September 1996 at St Catherine's Court, a historic mansion near Bath owned by the actress Jane Seymour. It was unoccupied but sometimes used for corporate functions. The change of setting marked an important transition in the recording process. Greenwood, comparing the mansion to previous studio settings, said it \"was less like a laboratory experiment, which is what being in a studio is usually like, and more about a group of people making their first record together\".The band made extensive use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on \"Exit Music (For a Film)\" feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and \"Let Down\" was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band to work at a different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that \"the biggest pressure was actually completing [the recording]. We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff.\" Yorke was satisfied with the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien estimated that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: \"I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural. ... Something special happens when you're playing live; a lot of it is just looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen.\" Many of Yorke's vocals were first takes; he felt that if he made other attempts he would \"start to think about it and it would sound really lame\".Radiohead returned to Canned Applause in October for rehearsals, and completed most of OK Computer in further sessions at St. Catherine's Court. By Christmas, they had narrowed the track listing to 14 songs. The strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London in January 1997. The album was mixed over the next two months at various London studios, then mastered by Chris Blair at Abbey Road.

Yevgeny Dolmatovsky recalled in the book \"Stories about your songs\" (1973):\n\"Tenderness\" is like a spell of a woman, a friend of the pilot, who released her beloved to the stars and is waiting for his return. The source of the song is the hour and a half that it took Yuri Gagarin to fly around the globe, the hours and minutes that other cosmonauts and <test-pilot> Georgy Mosolov spent on daring flights. It is not by chance that the poets Grebennikov and Dobronravov remembered Exup\u00e9ry. One of the first to talk ably about the experiences and feelings of a man who has gained wings, this dreamer and warrior, and cosmonauts, including Yuri Gagarin, often told poets: write about Exup\u00e9ry!In order for a song to be born and turned out, many circumstances, impressions, finds are needed.

The songs were written by singer Mark Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene and the album was compiled from a lengthy recording process at London's Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988. Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances that drew on elements of jazz, ambient, blues, classical music, and dub. These long-form recordings were then heavily edited and re-arranged into an album in mostly digital format.\nSpirit of Eden was a radical departure from Talk Talk's earlier and more accessible albums. Compared to the success of 1986's The Colour of Spring, it was a commercial disappointment. Despite its mixed reception, the album's stature grew more favourable in subsequent years, with contemporary critics describing Spirit of Eden as an underrated masterpiece, and early progenitor of the post-rock genre. In 2013, NME ranked Spirit of Eden at number 95 in its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", and in 2020, the same publication included Spirit of Eden on its list of \"The best new wave albums ever\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6495", "text": "Talk Talk, led by singer Mark Hollis, formed in England in the early 1980s.

{"id": "407_302", "question": "Which language was Gallagher written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_6506", "text": "Gallagher is an Irish surname. It originates from the Irish noble Gallagher family of County Donegal, Ireland. In Ireland, the anglicized version of the name \"Gallagher\" is pronounced /\u02c8\u0261\u0252l\u0259\u02cch\u0259r/ in County Donegal in Ulster, while elsewhere in the country it is most frequently pronounced as /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6l\u0259\u02cch\u0259r/. Outside Ireland, the pronunciation is often altered to /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6l\u0259\u02cc\u0261\u0259r/ in Britain and the USA. The name Gallagher is an anglicization of the Irish surname \u00d3 Gallchobhair, \u00d3 Gallchobhoir (or two alternative spelling forms, \u00d3 Gallch\u00f3ir and \u00d3 Gallach\u00f3ir), these being masculine forms; the corresponding feminine forms are N\u00ed Ghallchobhair (newer forms N\u00ed Ghallch\u00f3ir and N\u00ed Ghallach\u00f3ir). At least 30 recorded alternate variants exist, including O'Gallagher, Gallacher, Gallager, Gallaher, Gallocher, Galliher, Gollaher, Gollihar and Gallahue.\nThe earliest recorded incidence of the name is in a fragment of a manuscript currently in the Royal Library of Brussels, which states the name \"Gallchubhair\". A similarly earlier mention occurs in the Annals of the Four Masters, where it is recorded that Mael Cobo \u00dai Gallchobhar, Abbot of Scrin Adamnain, died in 1022 AD. Gallchobhar was the one given the role of founding father of the clan at the advent of widespread surname usage in Ireland, which began around the 10th century.\nAs with other modern Irish last names, \u00d3 Gallch\u00f3ir similarly appears to be a conjoined compound word.\nMost Gallaghers are found in the Americas, where approximately 60% of Gallaghers originate. The United States is the home to 55% of Gallaghers. Gallagher is also the most common surname in County Donegal (D\u00fan na nGall means \"fort of the foreigner\"), and thus is very common in Derry, and is the fourteenth-most-common by birth records in Ireland. In the United States, it was ranked by the 2020 US Census as the 482nd most common name.  According to Professor Edward MacLysaght, in the mid-20th century Gallagher was one of the most common Irish surnames, most of the recorded births being located in the northern province, Ulster, and the western province, Connacht, with the majority being recorded in the homeland of the sept\u2014County Donegal in Ulster. In 1890 it was ranked the 12th-most-common surname in Ireland, while in 1996 it was 20th.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6507", "text": "Gallagher Family (Shameless)\nMary Katherine Gallagher, fictional Saturday Night Live character", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_6507", "text": "Gallagher Family (Shameless)\nMary Katherine Gallagher, fictional Saturday Night Live character", "hasanswer": false}]}

AllMusic's Tim Sendra wrote that the album \"shows Harris to be a solid producer with an easily identifiable sound.\" Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite the variety of male collaborators, the album \"only deepens the impression that Harris is best when linked with a lady; his skills in that area are several times more developed than they are anywhere else.\" The Independent's Andy Gill was unimpressed by Ellie Goulding's performance on \"I Need Your Love\", but complimented Welch on \"Sweet Nothing\", and cited Harris's collaboration with Nicky Romero on \"Iron\" as the album's \"killer cut\".Emily Mackay of NME opined that \"[t]he best collaborations stand alone, but the rest demands small hours and sweat to animate it\", stating the album \"feels more like a deserved victory lap than a forward step or a new instalment, but apart from his sole vocal on 'Feel So Close', the victor seems oddly absent.\" Killian Fox of The Observer remarked, \"Nothing else on 18 Months matches up to the blockbusting collaborations with Kelis, Florence Welch and Rihanna\", concluding that \"Harris's production has become increasingly homogenised and, despite the array of vocalists, everything here risks sounding the same.\" At Entertainment Weekly, Melissa Maerz complimented songs like \"We Found Love\" and \"I Need Your Love\", but found that the album does not offer \"many surprises\". Despite referring to Harris as a \"brilliant pop craftsman\", The A.V. Club's Chris DeVille felt that the album \"suffers from EDM fatigue\" and that \"almost every track eventually congeals into the same automaton thud.\" Evan Sawdey of PopMatters critiqued that \"while 18 Months [...] is pretty much the hit-making monster that launched [Harris] in to the world spotlight, the truth of the matter is that it feels like a rather compromised vision of who he is an artist, sacrificing his quirkiness for a brooding new persona that starts to get stale over the course of a complete full-length.\" The Guardian critic Rebecca Nicholson expressed that \"Harris knows how to make the most of his guests, leading them through a series of euphoric bangers that seem destined for success. But for all the pop divas he has roped in, there's a veneer of cynical, laddy EDM, resulting in the kind of tracks Skrillex might come up with on an Ayia Napa booze cruise.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is an Anglicised form of the Scottish Gaelic and Irish Aonghas, which is composed of Celtic elements meaning \"one\" and \"choice\". A variant spelling of the Scottish Gaelic name is Aonghus. The Irish form of the Scottish Gaelic name is Aengus. A pet form of the given name Angus is Angie, pronounced \"an-ghee\", which represents the Scottish Gaelic Angaidh. A short form of the given name Angus is Gus, which may be lengthened to Gussie. The feminine form of Angus is Angusina.The earliest form of the given name Angus, and its cognates, occurs in Adomn\u00e1n's Vita Columbae (English: \"Life of Columba\") as Oinogusius, Oinogussius. This name likely refers to a Pictish king whose name is recorded variously as Onnust, Hungus. According to historian Alex Woolf, the early Gaelic form of the name, Oengus, was borrowed from the Pictish Onuist, which appears in British as Ungust. Woolf noted that these names are all derived from the Celtic *Oinogustos. Linguist John Kneen derived this name from two Celtic elements the following way: *Oino-gustos, meaning \"one-choice\". Woolf also stated that between about AD 350 and AD 660, the Insular Celtic dialects underwent changes which included the loss of the final syllables and unstressed vowels, which affected *Oinogustos thus: *Oinogustos.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6517", "text": "Aenghus Ua Flainn (died 1036), Abbot of Clonfert\nAengus Mac Grianna (born 1964), Irish newsreader for Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann (RT\u00c9)\nAngus Abbey (1925-?), Australian rules football player\nAngus Abranson, British game designer\nAngus Allan (1936\u20132007), British comic strip writer and magazine editor\nAngus B.

It was performed in Italian by Gigliola Cinquetti representing Italy. Like all previous Italian Eurovision entries, the song had also won that year's Sanremo Music Festival. Cinquetti was sixteen years old, making her the youngest Eurovision winner in history until 1986 when Belgium's Sandra Kim won the contest with \"J'aime la vie\" \u2013 initially claiming to be fifteen, it was later revealed that Kim was only thirteen. In 1990, the EBU made a new rule requiring contestants to be aged 16 or older before the contest; this age rule still operates.\nThe song was performed twelfth on the night, following Portugal's Ant\u00f3nio Calv\u00e1rio with \"Ora\u00e7\u00e3o\" and preceding Yugoslavia's Sabahudin Kurt with \"\u017divot je sklopio krug\". By the close of voting, it had received 49 points, placing it first in a field of 16.\n\"Non ho l'et\u00e0\" became a considerable commercial success for Cinquetti, in Italy, the rest of Europe, Scandinavia and other countries worldwide; she also recorded the song in English (\"This is my prayer\"), Spanish (\"No tengo edad\"), French (\"Je suis \u00e0 toi\"), German (\"Luna nel blu\"), and Japanese (\"Yumemiru omoi\", \u5922\u307f\u308b\u60f3\u3044). The song has since been recorded by a wide range of artists in other languages, for example, in Icelandic as \"Heyr m\u00edna b\u00e6n\" by Ell\u00fd Vilhj\u00e1lms. Lili Ivanova, a famous Bulgarian singer, and Hong Kong singer Rebecca Pan, covered the song in 1964. Polish-Belarusian singer Wies\u0142awa Drojecka covered the song in Polish (\"Nie wolno mi\"). Anneli Sari made a Finnish cover (\"Liian nuori rakkauteen\"). Sandra Reemer recorded the song in Dutch (\"Als jij maar wacht\").\nThe song was followed as contest winner in 1965 by France Gall singing \"Poup\u00e9e de cire, poup\u00e9e de son\" for Luxembourg.

Now, the young man returns to the Wizard's house where he meets a beautiful girl (Yevgeniya Simonova), and they immediately fall in love with each other. To his dismay, she turns out to be a princess \u2013 the Wizard made it so that a king (Yevgeny Leonov) who was just passing by with his daughter and his suite felt a sudden urge to stop by the estate. When the Princess, clueless about the young man's origin, wants to kiss him, he flees in horror.\nThe Princess hurries after him, dressed as a boy. They meet in a tavern called \"Emilia\", but the Bear, unable to recognize the Princess, summons her to a duel. However, when the Princess cries out \"Daddy\" during the battle, the Bear realizes that she deceived him.\nIn anger, he goes to the innkeeper (Yury Solomin) and begs to be to locked up, as the tavern is covered with snow and it is impossible to get out. The innkeeper gives him the key to a room. He draws his attention to one of the court ladies and recognizes in her his first love Emilia, in whose honor he named the inn. The innkeeper and Emilia decide to help the quarreled lovers.\nThe Princess locks herself in a room on the second floor of the inn and promises to shoot anyone who would come to her. The King orders to draw lots and the lot comes out for the court Minister Administrator (Andrei Mironov). The Administrator comes to the Princess, and a shot rings out \u2013 leaving behind the Princess, the administrator shoots her, but misses. The Princess angrily decides to marry the first courter and announces the Administrator to be her fianc\u00e9.\nThe King decides to play a wedding. Desperate, his love taken away from him, the Bear decides to tell all about the princess kiss that would turn him into a beast, but the Princess rejects him.\nThe wedding procession leaves. The Hunter (Vsevolod Larionov) and the Bear remain in the tavern. The Wizard appears and tells the Bear that he was disappointed in his behavior. He calls the Bear a coward. In the opinion of the Wizard the Bear should have kissed the princess. The fact that he didn't do that shows that he does not love the princess so much as to sacrifice his human form. The Bear and the Hunter make an agreement under which, if ever the Bear is to kiss the Princess and to turn into an animal, the Hunter will kill him.\nExactly one year passes by. The country is actually ruled by the Administrator instead of the King. The Princess is slowly dying of longing for the Bear. The Wizard intentionally does not let the Bear in the country and into his house, because he thinks that the tale with a sad end has much more to teach people, and stories with a happy ending are just for children.\nAs the Princess feels death coming, the Bear appears in the house of the Wizard.

The tale's characters come to life, come to his house and set out to live their lives. \nMany years ago, the Wizard came up with a \"reverse\" fairy tale, turning a bear into a human (Aleksandr Abdulov), who would transform back into a bear as soon as a princess falls in love with him and kisses him. Now, the young man returns to the Wizard's house where he meets a beautiful girl (Yevgeniya Simonova), and they immediately fall in love with each other. To his dismay, she turns out to be a princess \u2013 the Wizard made it so that a king (Yevgeny Leonov) who was just passing by with his daughter and his suite felt a sudden urge to stop by the estate. When the Princess, clueless about the young man's origin, wants to kiss him, he flees in horror.\nThe Princess hurries after him, dressed as a boy. They meet in a tavern called \"Emilia\", but the Bear, unable to recognize the Princess, summons her to a duel. However, when the Princess cries out \"Daddy\" during the battle, the Bear realizes that she deceived him.\nIn anger, he goes to the innkeeper (Yury Solomin) and begs to be to locked up, as the tavern is covered with snow and it is impossible to get out. The innkeeper gives him the key to a room. He draws his attention to one of the court ladies and recognizes in her his first love Emilia, in whose honor he named the inn. The innkeeper and Emilia decide to help the quarreled lovers.\nThe Princess locks herself in a room on the second floor of the inn and promises to shoot anyone who would come to her. The King orders to draw lots and the lot comes out for the court Minister Administrator (Andrei Mironov). The Administrator comes to the Princess, and a shot rings out \u2013 leaving behind the Princess, the administrator shoots her, but misses. The Princess angrily decides to marry the first courter and announces the Administrator to be her fianc\u00e9.\nThe King decides to play a wedding. Desperate, his love taken away from him, the Bear decides to tell all about the princess kiss that would turn him into a beast, but the Princess rejects him.\nThe wedding procession leaves. The Hunter (Vsevolod Larionov) and the Bear remain in the tavern. The Wizard appears and tells the Bear that he was disappointed in his behavior. He calls the Bear a coward. In the opinion of the Wizard the Bear should have kissed the princess. The fact that he didn't do that shows that he does not love the princess so much as to sacrifice his human form. The Bear and the Hunter make an agreement under which, if ever the Bear is to kiss the Princess and to turn into an animal, the Hunter will kill him.\nExactly one year passes by. The country is actually ruled by the Administrator instead of the King. The Princess is slowly dying of longing for the Bear. The Wizard intentionally does not let the Bear in the country and into his house, because he thinks that the tale with a sad end has much more to teach people, and stories with a happy ending are just for children.\nAs the Princess feels death coming, the Bear appears in the house of the Wizard.

Some of the Dalit writings published by the magazine were considered to be inflammatory by the middle class and even led to calls to ban the concerned issues. Sadhana brought the Dalit activists to the attention to the Marathi intelligentsia, and gave an impetus to the growing dalit movement.The magazine served as a voice for Socialist thought in India and played a key role in the mass awakening during the 21-month-long Emergency Rule in India that was imposed in June 1975. In July 1976, the Government of India led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi intimidated the weekly to stop publication by abusive use of national defence laws.

The band, initially called Roundabout, was the idea of former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis, who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore before leaving the project. The Mk. I line-up of the band was completed by vocalist/frontman Rod Evans, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice, in March 1968.\nAfter about two months of rehearsals, Shades of Deep Purple was recorded in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic. Stylistically, the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s.\nThe album was not well received in the UK, where it sold very few copies and did not chart.

Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock, using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society, where bands like Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, in line with the hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period.\nDuring this time of great creativity for the British musical scene in the summer of 1967, Chris Curtis, former drummer of the beat band The Searchers, contacted London businessman Tony Edwards to find financing for a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout. The name meant that the group would contain a revolving cast of non-permanent members getting on and off the stage like a musical roundabout, with only Curtis as mainstay and singer.

The result was determined by an assembled jury composed of two jurors from each country, with each juror ranking each song between 1 and 10 points.

{"id": "407_377", "question": "Which language was Here I Am written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_6728", "text": "Here I Am is the third studio album by American singer Kelly Rowland, released through Universal Motown and Universal Music Group on July 22, 2011. The album is Rowland's first release since parting ways with her manager Mathew Knowles and longtime Sony Music record label Columbia Records (through Knowles' Music World Entertainment). Here I Am is predominately a pop, R&B and dance album. It follows Rowland's assertion that \"no one puts her in a box\" with common themes around womanhood, sexual intimacy and love. Originally scheduled for release in 2010, the album was pushed back after the first round of singles were released to mixed critical and commercial reception.\n\"Commander\" (2010) produced by and featuring David Guetta topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and became a top-ten hit in the United Kingdom and some other European territories. Three other singles: \"Forever and a Day\", \"Rose Colored Glasses\" and \"Grown Woman\", all had limited commercial success and are subsequently included on selected editions of the album or excluded altogether. The international version of the album features seventeen songs including ones excluded from the US editions and some remixes. Here I Am also features guest performances from Lil Wayne, Nelly, Rico Love, Lil Playy, The WAV.s and Big Sean. Production of the album was handled by the likes of Rodney Jerkins, Guetta, Jim Jonsin, Hit-Boy, RedOne and The Runners. Love wrote half of the songs on the album, while Rowland co-wrote three songs on the album.\nAfter re-recording the majority of the album, a new single featuring Lil Wayne titled \"Motivation\", preceded the album in the United States. It was greeted with a positive reception from critics and topped the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart as well as peaking in the top-twenty of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Rowland's second most successful single as a lead artist in the United States. Here I Am was received well by critics, many of whom praised the strong productions and vocal performances but questioned some of the guests and a lack of the up-tempo dance sound Rowland had spoken of. Here I Am debuted at number one on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number three on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 147,000  copies. To date, it's Rowland's highest debuting album in the United States.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6729", "text": "During her 2008 performances at T4 on the Beach in Weston-Super-Mare, United Kingdom, Rowland was exposed to British bands and live festival music. It inspired her to pursue a new sound for her then untitled third album. She then travelled the South of France for vacation in Summer 2008 where she was exposed to dance music. It was here that she met French disc jockey (DJ) David Guetta and heard the foundations of \"When Love Takes Over\", a song that would leave a lasting impression on the singer. After falling in love with the song, Rowland would take it back to London to write and record the vocals with Australian songwriters, The Nervo Twins. However Columbia Records were not impressed with the new sound and the record was left unfinished until it was rediscovered by Guetta, when compiling his One Love album.In March 2009, it was revealed that the singer was parting ways with Columbia Records. Speaking of her decision to leave, Rowland said, \"as a solo artist, I felt the need to explore new directions, new challenges, and new freedoms outside my comfort zone and my friends and family at Columbia have been incredibly understanding about my evolution. I want to thank everyone at Columbia for the love and support they've shown and I will never forget how many good times we've had over the years.\" It was also announced in March that Guetta was releasing \"When Love Takes Over\", his collaboration with Rowland.

Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said \"the success comes at an intriguing time in Rowland's career\", having noted that she had landed a hosting job on Bravo's The Fashion Show and was in between labels.In October 2009 it was suggested that the success of the single had made Rowland consider signing a new record deal with EMI Music. Despite earlier claims, Rowland told Entertainment Weekly in 2010 that she didn't leave Columbia Records of her own accord. She was dropped because her previous album, Ms. Kelly (2007), was not commercially successful. Then in May 2010, speculation of Rowland's new record ended when an official press release revealed that she had signed to Universal Motown Records.

As of April 2024, it has about 139,000 articles. While all primary content is in Latin, modern languages such as English, Italian, French, German or Spanish are often used in discussions, since many users find this easier.\nProfessional Latinists have observed a gradual improvement in the encyclopedia. According to Robert Gurval, chairman of the UCLA classics department, \"the articles that are good are in fact very good,\" though some contributors do not write the language perfectly. The Latin Wikipedia was the first edition of Wikipedia written in a defunct language; others such as the Old Church Slavonic Wikipedia came later.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6764", "text": "When the Latin Wikipedia began, the predominant topics were those having to do with classical history, but beginning in 2006, a group of new contributors greatly expanded the coverage of 20th-century topics, such as pop culture and technology.The official policy of Vicipaedia is that neologisms and user coinings are not allowed (\"Noli fingere!\" Latin for \"Don't coin/make up things\"). In order to deal with concepts that did not exist in Classical or Medieval Latin, terms from modern Latin sources are used, such as botanical Latin, scientific Latin, 18th- and 19th-century Latin language encyclopedias and books, the official Vatican dictionary of modern Latin, as well as current Latin newspapers and radio shows, such as Ephemeris and Radio Bremen.As in any language with a broad international character, often more than one correct term exists for a given concept (just as in English a certain car part is called a \"bonnet\" by British speakers but a \"hood\" by Americans). In Latin the existence of multiple synonyms is even more prevalent since the language has been in continuous use over a wide geographical area for over 2000 years. Sometimes the same concept is represented by different terms in classical, medieval, scientific and modern Latin. In general Vicipaedia adopts the oldest or classical term for the page name, with redirects from any others; major alternatives are listed in the article with footnote references. There is often lively debate among editors about shades of meaning. The practice of avoiding invented words and giving references for alternative terms agrees well with the general Wikipedia insistence on verifiability and the rule against original research.\nMany universities and other institutions have official Latin names. In fields where Latin is the current standard language, Vicipaedia normally adopts official names as pagenames, even if they belong to scientific or technical, rather than to classical Latin. This applies to:\n\nnames of Catholic dioceses\nCatholic official titles\nbiological species and other taxa\nplanets, asteroids, satellites, and constellations\ntopographical features on extraterrestrial bodies\nanatomical names\nnames of diseasesWhen occasionally a term for a modern concept cannot be found, the customary practice is to do exactly what most other languages do: to borrow an international word (often from a Romance language or English).

In order to deal with concepts that did not exist in Classical or Medieval Latin, terms from modern Latin sources are used, such as botanical Latin, scientific Latin, 18th- and 19th-century Latin language encyclopedias and books, the official Vatican dictionary of modern Latin, as well as current Latin newspapers and radio shows, such as Ephemeris and Radio Bremen.As in any language with a broad international character, often more than one correct term exists for a given concept (just as in English a certain car part is called a \"bonnet\" by British speakers but a \"hood\" by Americans). In Latin the existence of multiple synonyms is even more prevalent since the language has been in continuous use over a wide geographical area for over 2000 years. Sometimes the same concept is represented by different terms in classical, medieval, scientific and modern Latin. In general Vicipaedia adopts the oldest or classical term for the page name, with redirects from any others; major alternatives are listed in the article with footnote references. There is often lively debate among editors about shades of meaning. The practice of avoiding invented words and giving references for alternative terms agrees well with the general Wikipedia insistence on verifiability and the rule against original research.\nMany universities and other institutions have official Latin names. In fields where Latin is the current standard language, Vicipaedia normally adopts official names as pagenames, even if they belong to scientific or technical, rather than to classical Latin.

He subsequently came up with the rest of the cover based on the idea of people moving in and out of the tenement, with various sleeves that could be placed under the main cover and filling the windows with various pieces of information.The two five-storey buildings photographed for the album cover are located at 96 and 98 St. Mark's Place in New York City. The original photograph underwent a number of tweaks to arrive at the final image. The fourth floor of the building had to be cropped out to fit the square album cover format. (The front doorway and stoop at 96 St. Mark's Place is also the location used by the Rolling Stones for the music video promoting their single \"Waiting on a Friend\", from their 1981 album Tattoo You).\nEschewing the usual gatefold design in favour of a special die-cut cover, the original album jacket included four covers made up of two inners (for each disc), a middle insert cover and an outer cover. The middle insert cover is white and details all the album track listings and recording information. The outer cover has die-cut windows on the building, so when the middle cover is wrapped around the inner covers and slid into the outer cover, the title of the album is shown on the front cover, spelling out the name \"Physical Graffiti\". Images in the windows touched upon a set of American icons and a range of Hollywood ephemera. Pictures of W. C. Fields and Buzz Aldrin alternated with the snapshots of Led Zeppelin. Photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald, Marcel Duchamp and Pope Leo XIII are also featured. Per the liner notes, package concept and design was by AGI/Mike Doud (London) and Peter Corriston (New York). Photography was by Elliott Erwitt, B. P. Fallon, and Roy Harper. \"Tinting Extraordinaire\": Maurice Tate, and window illustration by Dave Heffernan. In 1976, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of best album package.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Produced by Tony Visconti and recorded in London from April to May 1970, the album features the first appearances on a Bowie record of future Spiders from Mars members Mick Ronson and Mick Woodmansey.\nFollowing the largely acoustic and folk rock sound of David Bowie (1969), The Man Who Sold the World marked a shift toward hard rock, with elements of blues rock. The lyrics are darker than his previous releases, exploring themes of insanity, religion, technology and war. None of its songs were released as singles; some tracks appeared as B-sides between 1970 and 1973. Originally titled Metrobolist, a play on the film Metropolis (1927), the title was changed at the last minute by Mercury without Bowie's consultation.\nThe album was released with different cover artwork in the US and the UK. For the US release, the artwork was a cartoon-like drawing by Michael J. Weller of a cowboy in front of an asylum. The UK cover by Keith MacMillan features Bowie wearing a Michael Fish-designed blue dress. A 1972 reissue by RCA Records featured a black-and-white picture of Bowie's then-current character Ziggy Stardust; reissues since 1990 have revived the original UK artwork.\nThe Man Who Sold the World was originally better received by music critics in the US than in the UK. Nevertheless, it was a commercial failure in both countries; the 1972 reissue managed to chart in both the US and the UK. Retrospectively, the album has been praised by critics for the band's performance and the unsettling nature of its music and lyrics, being considered by many to be the start of Bowie's \"classic period\".

By 1970, the attention Bowie had garnered from \"Space Oddity\" had dissipated and his follow-up single, \"The Prettiest Star\", failed to chart. Realising that his potential as a solo artist was dwindling, Bowie decided to form a band with bassist Tony Visconti, who previously worked with Bowie on Space Oddity, and drummer John Cambridge.

Other candidates the band considered were Flood and Brian Eno, however they could not fit the band into their schedules. Buller had in fact welcomed a parting of the ways due to the fractious relationship between the band members during the recording of the last album. However, in friendly discussions with Anderson, Buller found that his ideas about a possible new Suede direction tallied almost exactly with the band's own: to write less complex, more immediate songs; to use heavier drum sounds, play fewer guitar solos and only employ string sections on a couple of songs such as \"She\" and \"The Chemistry Between Us.\" The album was recorded between December 1995 and June 1996 at various locations. To prepare for its recording, the band had immersed themselves in T. Rex's 1972 album The Slider and its successor, Tanx; as Buller stated that his aspiration was to make \"The Slider for the Nineties.\" T. Rex became the blueprint of the recording process, as the band spent a month at The Town House just working on drums.Buller explained how the recording process worked: \"Basically, what we did, is that every track started with acoustic guitar, bongos, tambourine and Brett [Anderson], so it all started life pretty much the same way that Marc Bolan recorded all of his stuff originally.\" Bass player Mat Osman recalls how Buller was keen on making the album simple. \"He was really keen on using all those devices: the big repeated end, the handclaps, the straightforward chorus, make it big and obvious.\" In an interview on the eve of the album's release, Anderson stated: \"I wanted it to be a complete turnover from the last album, which was very dark and dank ... I wanted it to be communicative and understandable.\" Two songs which made it onto Coming Up had already been written in the early days of Suede. \"Lazy\" and \"By the Sea\" were two of Anderson's own compositions. \"By the Sea\" was actually written when Suede were recording their first album, which is why the song's opening line is similar to \"So Young\". Unlike the tense and chaotic recording of Dog Man Star, which according to Anderson was mostly written \"by post\", in a shift-like format, the new material was far more celebratory in both its development and execution.As opposed to the previous album which followed a stringent pattern of Butler composing music for Anderson's lyrics, Coming Up was a more collaborative project. Anderson stated: \"Coming Up was more of a meritocracy \u2013 if something was good enough, it didn't matter what the source was.\" Songs such as \"By the Sea\" and \"She\" required the use of keyboards. Faced with the problem as to how to play them live, Suede recruited Simon Gilbert's cousin Neil Codling, who made his debut at a fan-club gig in January 1996. Buller has stated that the reason why the album has a much better sound than the previous albums is that he had minimal involvement in the mixing process, mixing only two songs. Buller credits much of the album's success to Dave Bascombe, who mixed the majority of the songs. According to Buller, having an outside observer mix the record with \"fresh ears\" enhances the overall production quality. Bascombe's input on \"Trash\" was crucial, as it was his idea to speed up the vocals. One of Suede's popular B-sides \"Young Men\" was left off the album, as Buller felt it was \"too dark\" and not as \"poppy [and] in your face\" as other songs on the record.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_6917", "text": "After the departure of guitarist Bernard Butler and the lack of commercial success with Dog Man Star and its singles, Suede were being somewhat dismissed by the British music press with Oasis, Blur and Pulp taking the limelight.

However, in friendly discussions with Anderson, Buller found that his ideas about a possible new Suede direction tallied almost exactly with the band's own: to write less complex, more immediate songs; to use heavier drum sounds, play fewer guitar solos and only employ string sections on a couple of songs such as \"She\" and \"The Chemistry Between Us.\" The album was recorded between December 1995 and June 1996 at various locations. To prepare for its recording, the band had immersed themselves in T. Rex's 1972 album The Slider and its successor, Tanx; as Buller stated that his aspiration was to make \"The Slider for the Nineties.\" T. Rex became the blueprint of the recording process, as the band spent a month at The Town House just working on drums.Buller explained how the recording process worked: \"Basically, what we did, is that every track started with acoustic guitar, bongos, tambourine and Brett [Anderson], so it all started life pretty much the same way that Marc Bolan recorded all of his stuff originally.\" Bass player Mat Osman recalls how Buller was keen on making the album simple. \"He was really keen on using all those devices: the big repeated end, the handclaps, the straightforward chorus, make it big and obvious.\" In an interview on the eve of the album's release, Anderson stated: \"I wanted it to be a complete turnover from the last album, which was very dark and dank ... I wanted it to be communicative and understandable.\" Two songs which made it onto Coming Up had already been written in the early days of Suede. \"Lazy\" and \"By the Sea\" were two of Anderson's own compositions. \"By the Sea\" was actually written when Suede were recording their first album, which is why the song's opening line is similar to \"So Young\". Unlike the tense and chaotic recording of Dog Man Star, which according to Anderson was mostly written \"by post\", in a shift-like format, the new material was far more celebratory in both its development and execution.As opposed to the previous album which followed a stringent pattern of Butler composing music for Anderson's lyrics, Coming Up was a more collaborative project. Anderson stated: \"Coming Up was more of a meritocracy \u2013 if something was good enough, it didn't matter what the source was.\" Songs such as \"By the Sea\" and \"She\" required the use of keyboards. Faced with the problem as to how to play them live, Suede recruited Simon Gilbert's cousin Neil Codling, who made his debut at a fan-club gig in January 1996. Buller has stated that the reason why the album has a much better sound than the previous albums is that he had minimal involvement in the mixing process, mixing only two songs. Buller credits much of the album's success to Dave Bascombe, who mixed the majority of the songs. According to Buller, having an outside observer mix the record with \"fresh ears\" enhances the overall production quality. Bascombe's input on \"Trash\" was crucial, as it was his idea to speed up the vocals. One of Suede's popular B-sides \"Young Men\" was left off the album, as Buller felt it was \"too dark\" and not as \"poppy [and] in your face\" as other songs on the record.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Initially, its editorial staff had four people: Jan Piwowarczyk, a priest; Jerzy Turowicz, editor-in-chief for many years; Konstanty Turowski and Maria Czapska. Later, they were joined by Zofia Starowieyska\u2013Morstinowa, Stefan Kisielewski, Leopold Tyrmand, Antoni Go\u0142ubiew, Pawe\u0142 Jasienica (until he was arrested by the communists in 1948), Stanis\u0142aw Stomma, Hanna Malewska and J\u00f3zefa Golmont\u2013Hennelowa.\nIn 1953, the weekly was suspended and lost its printing house after it had refused to print the obituary of Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. From 1953 to 1956, it was published by new editors, representing the pro-government PAX Association and was informally known as Tygodnik Paxowski. The same format was used and numbering was continuous during that period although none of the previous editors still worked for the paper.\nAfter the 1956 Polish October, the \"Thaw\" allowed the original editors were able to resume control of the magazine in December. Columnists have included prominent clerics, such as Karol Wojty\u0142a (later Pope John Paul II), academics and poets, journalists and other writers, including W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski, Jerzy Zawieyski, Jacek Wo\u017aniakowski, Stefan Wilkanowicz, Adam Szostkiewicz, Leszek Ko\u0142akowski, Stanis\u0142aw Lem, Zbigniew Herbert, Wojciech Karpi\u0144ski, Tadeusz Kudli\u0144ski and Czes\u0142aw Zgorzelski.\nCzes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz published his poems in Tygodnik Powszechny for many years. In 1945, he prepared a handwritten volume of poems, Wiersze p\u00f3\u0142-perskie, for Jerzy Turowicz, the editor. Forced into exile to the United States, Mi\u0142osz continued to publish in the magazine.

Their grammatical forms and meanings have been reconstructed by modern linguists, based on similarities found across all Indo-European languages. This article discusses nouns and adjectives; Proto-Indo-European pronouns are treated elsewhere.\nThe Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) had eight or nine cases, three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and probably originally two genders (animate and neuter), with the animate later splitting into the masculine and the feminine.\nNominals fell into multiple different declensions. Most of them had word stems ending in a consonant (called athematic stems) and exhibited a complex pattern of accent shifts and/or vowel changes (ablaut) among the different cases.\nTwo declensions ended in a vowel (*-o/e-) and are called thematic; they were more regular and became more common during the history of PIE and its older daughter languages.\nPIE very frequently derived nominals from verbs. Just as English giver and gift are ultimately related to the verb give, *d\u00e9h\u2083tors 'giver' and *d\u00e9h\u2083nom 'gift' are derived from *deh\u2083- 'to give', but the practice was much more common in PIE.

It peaked at No. 155 on the Billboard 200. The album title was credited to Ringo Starr. Rather than using the album as a chance to showcase his drumming skill, Moon sang lead vocals on all tracks, and played drums only on three of the tracks (\"Crazy Like a Fox\", \"The Kids Are Alright\" and \"Move Over Ms. L\"), although he played percussion on \"Don't Worry Baby\". The album features contributions from Ringo Starr, Harry Nilsson, Joe Walsh of the Eagles, Jim Keltner, Bobby Keys, Klaus Voormann, John Sebastian, Flo & Eddie (Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan of the Turtles), Spencer Davis, Dick Dale, Suzi Quatro's sister Patti Quatro, Patti's bandmates from Fanny Jean Millington and Nickey Barclay, and future actor Miguel Ferrer.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_7055", "text": "Moon was the last member of the Who to release a solo album. By this point, John Entwistle had released Smash Your Head Against the Wall (with Moon playing percussion and singing backing vocals), Roger Daltrey released his hit album Daltrey (1973), and Pete Townshend had produced several Meher Baba tribute albums and the demo compilation Who Came First (1972).\nMoon had moved into the Beverly Wilshire Hotel with assistant Dougal Butler in March 1974, to play on the sessions for Harry Nilsson's Pussy Cats. The album was produced by John Lennon. Lennon and Nilsson had been ejected from the Troubadour for drunkenly heckling a Smothers Brothers performance several days before Moon's arrival. The three, along with Ringo Starr (who also drummed on Pussy Cats), Lennon's girlfriend May Pang, bassist Klaus Voormann, Voormann's girlfriend Cynthia Webb, and Starr's manager Hilary Gerrard, moved together into a Santa Monica beach house for three weeks. The sessions were affected by Lennon, Nilsson, Moon and Starr's excessive lifestyles and drug abuse, ultimately prompting Lennon to relocate the sessions to New York City.\nAt the time of Moon's arrival, Lennon had made initial recordings for Rock 'n' Roll (1975) with Phil Spector, and David Bowie and Bryan Ferry had also released cover albums; Bowie's Pin Ups (1973) notably included two songs by the Who, \"I Can't Explain\" and \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\". Encountering the Beatles' former road manager Mal Evans on the Sunset Strip, Moon suggested that Evans produce a solo album for him.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_7056", "text": "The first song, a cover version of the Beach Boys' \"Don't Worry Baby\", was recorded in late March at the Record Plant Studios. The musicians included John Sebastian, Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, Jesse Ed Davis, and Miguel Ferrer playing drums. Kaylan described the album as \"a fantasy record for him\", allowing him to live out his fantasy to \"be a Beach Boy\". For this reason, Moon largely avoided playing the drums, as he considered drumming his \"job\". Moon left Los Angeles on 19 April to begin filming Tommy, and after the filming concluded, unofficially relocated to California in August 1974, to work on the studio album.The album would be funded by a recording contract directly with Los Angeles' MCA Records arranged by Bill Curbishley and Peter Rudge. Funding was unavailable from London due to Track Records' legal problems with former Who managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, and Moon's extravagant spending habits made labels reluctant to fund the sessions. Biographer Tony Fletcher expresses astonishment that MCA approved the album's recording and released the \"travesty of a Beach Boys cover\" as a single rather than rejecting the master tapes for \"Don't Worry Baby\".The sessions for Two Sides of the Moon were affected by the \"lazy and decadent self-indulgence\" of mid-1970s Los Angeles' \"superstar scene\". Inconsistent working hours and substance abuse slowed down the sessions considerably. The atmosphere of the studio resembled that of a club. Engineer Gary Ladinsky recalled: \"You'd get something done for an hour, and then it's a party scene. Eventually, you clear out the studio and you might do something for another half an hour, and then people wander out, and you realise, 'I guess the session is over.'\"After \"Teenage Idol\", with Dick Dale guesting on guitar, was delivered to MCA, Evans was fired. Fletcher attributes this to Moon's realisation that the sessions were largely fruitless and Evans' own drinking problem was worsening. Skip Taylor replaced him as producer. Volman and engineer John Stronach described Taylor as the main provider of drugs for the sessions. Taylor did not dispute the assessment: \"I would go in and decide, is this a night where we should have a little brandy, or should we smoke some stuff, or should we put a couple of lines out?\"Most of the musicians involved saw no real difference as a result of the change. Kaylan commented that after recording his parts twice, \"Basically it was the same record.\" Joe Walsh, then recording So What with Stronach at the Record Plant, was brought in to play additional guitar on \"The Kids Are Alright\" late in the sessions. He described the results as \"semi-train wrecks\" and expressed surprise that Moon had only used two producers since he would \"fry\" anyone who worked with him.Moon's contributions to the album were primarily vocals. He only played drums on three songs, simultaneously accompanied by session drummers.

Stronach recalled, \"He'd come in, reach into his pockets, and there'd be pills and cocaine falling out.\" Moon had previously been able to sing adequately on several songs from the A Quick One (1966), Ready Steady Who (1966), The Who Sell Out (1967) and Quadrophenia (1973) sessions.

By this point, John Entwistle had released Smash Your Head Against the Wall (with Moon playing percussion and singing backing vocals), Roger Daltrey released his hit album Daltrey (1973), and Pete Townshend had produced several Meher Baba tribute albums and the demo compilation Who Came First (1972).\nMoon had moved into the Beverly Wilshire Hotel with assistant Dougal Butler in March 1974, to play on the sessions for Harry Nilsson's Pussy Cats. The album was produced by John Lennon. Lennon and Nilsson had been ejected from the Troubadour for drunkenly heckling a Smothers Brothers performance several days before Moon's arrival. The three, along with Ringo Starr (who also drummed on Pussy Cats), Lennon's girlfriend May Pang, bassist Klaus Voormann, Voormann's girlfriend Cynthia Webb, and Starr's manager Hilary Gerrard, moved together into a Santa Monica beach house for three weeks. The sessions were affected by Lennon, Nilsson, Moon and Starr's excessive lifestyles and drug abuse, ultimately prompting Lennon to relocate the sessions to New York City.\nAt the time of Moon's arrival, Lennon had made initial recordings for Rock 'n' Roll (1975) with Phil Spector, and David Bowie and Bryan Ferry had also released cover albums; Bowie's Pin Ups (1973) notably included two songs by the Who, \"I Can't Explain\" and \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\". Encountering the Beatles' former road manager Mal Evans on the Sunset Strip, Moon suggested that Evans produce a solo album for him.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_7056", "text": "The first song, a cover version of the Beach Boys' \"Don't Worry Baby\", was recorded in late March at the Record Plant Studios. The musicians included John Sebastian, Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, Jesse Ed Davis, and Miguel Ferrer playing drums. Kaylan described the album as \"a fantasy record for him\", allowing him to live out his fantasy to \"be a Beach Boy\". For this reason, Moon largely avoided playing the drums, as he considered drumming his \"job\". Moon left Los Angeles on 19 April to begin filming Tommy, and after the filming concluded, unofficially relocated to California in August 1974, to work on the studio album.The album would be funded by a recording contract directly with Los Angeles' MCA Records arranged by Bill Curbishley and Peter Rudge. Funding was unavailable from London due to Track Records' legal problems with former Who managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, and Moon's extravagant spending habits made labels reluctant to fund the sessions. Biographer Tony Fletcher expresses astonishment that MCA approved the album's recording and released the \"travesty of a Beach Boys cover\" as a single rather than rejecting the master tapes for \"Don't Worry Baby\".The sessions for Two Sides of the Moon were affected by the \"lazy and decadent self-indulgence\" of mid-1970s Los Angeles' \"superstar scene\". Inconsistent working hours and substance abuse slowed down the sessions considerably. The atmosphere of the studio resembled that of a club. Engineer Gary Ladinsky recalled: \"You'd get something done for an hour, and then it's a party scene. Eventually, you clear out the studio and you might do something for another half an hour, and then people wander out, and you realise, 'I guess the session is over.'\"After \"Teenage Idol\", with Dick Dale guesting on guitar, was delivered to MCA, Evans was fired. Fletcher attributes this to Moon's realisation that the sessions were largely fruitless and Evans' own drinking problem was worsening. Skip Taylor replaced him as producer. Volman and engineer John Stronach described Taylor as the main provider of drugs for the sessions. Taylor did not dispute the assessment: \"I would go in and decide, is this a night where we should have a little brandy, or should we smoke some stuff, or should we put a couple of lines out?\"Most of the musicians involved saw no real difference as a result of the change. Kaylan commented that after recording his parts twice, \"Basically it was the same record.\" Joe Walsh, then recording So What with Stronach at the Record Plant, was brought in to play additional guitar on \"The Kids Are Alright\" late in the sessions. He described the results as \"semi-train wrecks\" and expressed surprise that Moon had only used two producers since he would \"fry\" anyone who worked with him.Moon's contributions to the album were primarily vocals. He only played drums on three songs, simultaneously accompanied by session drummers. Stronach said that the sessions had two drummers: \"One to keep time and then Keith to play over it.\" The first set of vocals recorded with Evans, done while Moon was drunk, was discarded.

The most important versions are the one in Robert Vaughan's Peniarth MS. 20 and the slightly less complete one in the Red Book of Hergest. The version entitled Brenhinoedd y Saeson (Kings of the English) combines material from the Welsh annals with material from an English source.\nThe Peniarth MS. 20 version begins in 682 with a record of the death of Cadwaladr and ends in 1332. The entries for the earlier years are brief, usually records of deaths and events such as eclipses, plagues or earthquakes, but later entries are much more detailed. The main focus is on the rulers of the kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth, but ecclesiastical events are also mentioned, such as the bringing of the date of celebrating Easter in the Welsh church into line with Rome by \"Elbodius\" (Elfodd), Bishop of Bangor, in 768. Events in England, Ireland, Scotland, Brittany and sometimes France are also briefly chronicled.\nThe original monastic annals are thought to have been written at Strata Florida Abbey, but may have been kept at the old abbey at Llanbadarn Fawr in the 11th century.

Iommi recalls recording live: \"We thought, 'We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff.\"The key to the band's new sound on the album was Iommi's distinctive playing style that he developed after an accident at a sheet metal factory where he was working at the age of 17 in which the tips of the middle fingers of his fretting hand were severed. Iommi created a pair of false fingertips using plastic from a dish detergent bottle and tuned the strings on his guitar down to make it easier for him to bend the strings, creating a massive, heavy sound. \"I'd play a load of chords and I'd have to play fifths because I couldn't play fourths because of my fingers,\" Iommi explained to Phil Alexander in Mojo in 2013. \"That helped me develop my style of playing, bending the strings and hitting the open string at the same time just to make the sound wilder.\" In the same article bassist Geezer Butler added, \"Back then the bass player was supposed to do all these melodic runs, but I didn't know how to do that because I'd been a guitarist, so all I did was follow Tony's riff.

The SG was a right-handed model which the left-handed Iommi played upside down. Soon after recording the album, he met a right-handed guitarist who was playing a left-handed SG upside down, and the two agreed to swap guitars; this is the SG that Iommi modified and later \"put out to pasture\" at the Hard Rock Cafe.Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne has always spoken fondly of the recording of the band's debut album, stating in his autobiography I Am Ozzy, \"Once we'd finished, we spent a couple of hours double-tracking some of the guitar and vocals, and that was that.

The local co-conspirators do not know what the courier looks like; they only know that he is supposed to say a code word to identify himself.

In logic, where his thinking was more closely aligned with humanism than with scholasticism, his main publications were Institutionum Dialecticarum (1564), and Isagoge Philosophica (1591).\nFonseca filled many important posts in his order, being assistant, for Portugal, to the general, visitor of Portugal, and superior of the professed house at Lisbon; while Gregory XIII and Philip II (from 1580 King of Portugal) employed him in affairs of the greatest delicacy and consequence. Fonseca used his influence wisely in promoting the interests of charity and learning. Many great institutions in Lisbon, notably the Irish college, owe their existence, at least in great part, to his zeal and piety. He is also credited with a considerable share in the drawing up of the Jesuit Ratio Studiorum.

They are composed of a given name (simple or composite) and two surnames (the first surname of each parent). Traditionally, the first surname is the father's first surname, and the second is the mother's first surname. Since 1999, the order of the surnames in a family in Spain is decided when registering the first child, but the traditional order is nearly universally chosen (99.53% of the time).\nThe practice is to use one given name and the first surname generally (e.g. \"Pen\u00e9lope Cruz\" for Pen\u00e9lope Cruz S\u00e1nchez); the complete name is reserved for legal, formal and documentary matters. Both surnames are sometimes systematically used when the first surname is very common (e.g., Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Pablo Ruiz Picasso or Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero) to get a more distinguishable name. In these cases, it is even common to use only the second surname, as in \"Lorca\", \"Picasso\" or \"Zapatero\". This does not affect alphabetization: \"Lorca\", the Spanish poet, must be alphabetized in an index under \"Garc\u00eda Lorca\", not \"Lorca\" or \"Garc\u00eda\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_7176", "text": "Currently in Spain, people bear a single or composite given name (nombre in Spanish) and two surnames (apellidos in Spanish).\nA composite given name is composed of two (or more) single names; for example, Juan Pablo is considered not to be a first and a second forename, but a single composite forename.The two surnames refer to each of the parental families. Traditionally, a person's first surname is the father's first surname (apellido paterno), while their second surname is the mother's first surname (apellido materno). For example, if a man named Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez Garrido marries a woman named Mar\u00eda Dolores Mart\u00ednez Ruiz (note that women do not change their name with marriage) and they have a child named Jos\u00e9, there are several legal options, but their child would most usually be known as Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez.\nSpanish gender equality law has allowed surname transposition since 1999, subject to the condition that every sibling must bear the same surname order recorded in the Registro Civil (civil registry), but there have been legal exceptions. Since 2013, if the parents of a child were unable to agree on the order of surnames, an official would decide which is to come first, with the paternal name being the default option. The only requirement is that every son and daughter must have the same order of the surnames, so they cannot change it separately. Since June 2017, adopting the paternal name first is no longer the standard method, and parents are required to sign an agreement wherein the name order is expressed explicitly. The law also grants a person the option, upon reaching adulthood, of reversing the order of their surnames.

For example, if a man named Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez Garrido marries a woman named Mar\u00eda Dolores Mart\u00ednez Ruiz (note that women do not change their name with marriage) and they have a child named Jos\u00e9, there are several legal options, but their child would most usually be known as Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez.\nSpanish gender equality law has allowed surname transposition since 1999, subject to the condition that every sibling must bear the same surname order recorded in the Registro Civil (civil registry), but there have been legal exceptions. Since 2013, if the parents of a child were unable to agree on the order of surnames, an official would decide which is to come first, with the paternal name being the default option. The only requirement is that every son and daughter must have the same order of the surnames, so they cannot change it separately. Since June 2017, adopting the paternal name first is no longer the standard method, and parents are required to sign an agreement wherein the name order is expressed explicitly.

H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, Elle's pioneering founder, returned to Paris from New York City to create a unique publication that grappled with the many forces shaping women's lives in France in 1945. Women won the right to vote in 1944, and Elle dove immediately into long-form \"newspaper-like\" features on women's role in national politics and the growing feminist movement. Elle would \"celebrate a new type of woman: independent, modern, active, comfortable in her own skin and her time\". The first issue of Elle France was published on 21 November 1945 featuring Yolande Bloin on the cover dressed by Elsa Schiaparelli. Bloin was an actress in Jacques Becker's film Falbalas. The magazine had a circulation of 110,000 copies in 1945.In the Elle articles featuring rising fashion designers, the magazine would provide free patterns of some of their fashion pieces. This allowed the general public to experience haute couture as the glamour of the fashion world was becoming accessible to the common working class.Its 100th issue, published on 14 October 1947, featured the work of Christian Dior just eight months after his debut show. Likewise, Brigitte Bardot had her first Elle cover at age 17, on 7 January 1952, months before her screen debut in Manina, the Girl in the Bikini.\nOn 2 April 1956, Grace Kelly appeared on the cover of Elle France, a few days before her marriage to Rainier III, Prince of Monaco. On 16 July 1956, Elle France featured Marilyn Monroe on the cover.By the 1960s, Elle had a readership of 800,000 across France and was said to \"not so much reflect fashion as decree it.\" This dominance was reflected in the famous slogan: \"Si elle lit elle lit Elle (If she reads, she reads Elle)\" (lit. \"If she reads she reads She\").Lagard\u00e8re Group subsidiary, Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias began pushing Elle outside of France in 1985, launching Elle in the UK and the United States. The Chinese version of the magazine was first published in 1988. It was the first four-colour fashion magazine offered in China. The magazine was an informational and educational tool for opening the Chinese textile market.In 1987, Elle Decoration was launched in France by the Lagard\u00e8re Group.

After Salekh destroys the ship's radio equipment, the Mercury starts her engines and approaches the Nezhin. At that moment, the Nezhin's crew see the bodies of the boarding party, floating in the water behind the Mercury. The Soviet captain realizes that his ship is under attack by pirates.\nTheir attempt to escape is foiled when the Mercury rams the ship and the pirates open fire with assault rifles and machine guns. The pirates board the Nezhin, brutally killing Russian crew members who fight them. Sergey, the chief-mate of the Nezhin, discovers the dead radio operator and decides to find Salekh. Chasing Salekh through the corridors of the ship, Sergey makes an attempt to stop him. Salekh shows impressive martial arts skills and quickly defeats the chief-mate. Soon after, the pirates lock the remaining Russians into crew compartments and begin to offload the opium to the Mercury. The pirate captain thanks Salekh for a successful mission and orders him to blow up the Nezhin together with her crew. The Soviets, left to die on a sinking ship, manage to escape and must fight the pirates for survival.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_7226", "text": "Nikolai Yeremenko Jr. as Sergey Sergeyevich (Chief Engineer)\nPyotr Velyaminov as Ivan Ilych (Soviet Captain)\nTalgat Nigmatulin as Salekh\nRein Aren as Captain of Pirates\nDilorom Kambarova as Island girl\nNatalya Khorokhorina as Mascha\nIgor Kashintsev as Agent Lotus\nDzhigangir Shakhmuradov as Noah\nIgor Klass as Joachim Schweiggert\nTadeush Kasyanov as Bosun\nMaija Egl\u012bte as Aina\nAlexander Bespaly as Chief mate\nViktor Zhiganov as Igor Stetsenko\nGeorgy Martirosyan as Georgiy Kluyev\nLeonid Trutnev as Radio operator\nVladimir Smirnov as Political commissar\nViktor Gordeyev as Yura Mikosha\nVladimir Yepiskoposyan as Bearded pirate\nFarkhat Aminov", "hasanswer": false}]}

Zumoto closely tied the operations of the two newspapers, with subscriptions of The Seoul Press being sold in Japan by The Japan Times, and vice versa for Korea. Both papers wrote critically of Korean culture and civilization, and advocated for Japan's colonial control over the peninsula in order to civilize the Koreans.The newspaper was independent of government control, but from 1931 onward, the paper's editors experienced mounting pressure from the Japanese government to submit to its policies. In 1933, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed Hitoshi Ashida, former ministry official, as chief editor.During World War II, the newspaper served as an outlet for Imperial Japanese government communication and editorial opinion. It was successively renamed The Japan Times and Mail (1918\u20131940) following its merger with The Japan Mail, The Japan Times and Advertiser (1940\u20131943) following its merger with The Japan Advertiser, and Nippon Times (1943\u20131956), before reverting to the Japan Times title in 1956. The temporary change to Nippon Times occurred during the ban on English language sentiment during World War II-era Japan.Shintaro Fukushima (1907\u20131987) became president of The Japan Times in 1956.

Partly filmed at the Natural History Museum in London, the documentary features an encounter between Icelandic singer-songwriter and musician Bj\u00f6rk and English broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough. They discuss the nature of music and the intersection between music, nature and technology. It also follows the singer as she prepares for her Biophilia Tour, along with rehearsal and studio recording.\nThe documentary was inspired by the singer's eighth studio album Biophilia (2011), which was released as a series of apps which blends nature elements with musicology. Collaborators in the project Scott Snibbe, Damian Taylor, and Andy Cavatorta appear in the documentary to talk about their role in the development of the album and the live show. It also includes neurologist Oliver Sacks, who talks about the effect of music on the brain.\nDespite the low ratings, the show received positive to moderate reviews from critics, who applauded the content of the documentary but, in some cases, criticised the interaction between Attenborough and Bj\u00f6rk, which was considered \"awkward\" and \"unlikely\".

On 1 August 2012, it was reported that UK Channel 4 had inked a deal to air a documentary, tentatively titled Attenborough and Bj\u00f6rk: The Nature of Music, that would have included a discussion between the two about the story of music, human's relationship with it and how technology could evolve the way we engage with it. The documentary was inspired by the Biophilia project and would have featured footage commented by Attenborough, along with a showcase of the instruments created for the Biophilia Tour. British-American neurologist Oliver Sacks was also reported to appear in the documentary, explaining \"the extraordinary and beneficial effects music has on our brains\". The documentary, made by the company Pulse Films, is the first time the British television channel and the company had collaborated. It was directed by Louise Hooper and executive produced by Lucas Ochoa, who commented about the project:\n\n\"Born from Bjork's revolutionary music project we are thrilled to be able to document this incredible journey with her; she is undeniably one of the most iconic figures in popular culture and truly pushes boundaries like no other artist does.\"\nThe English naturalist had previously provided the spoken introduction for the live shows and the apps. The two had long admired each other's works. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bj\u00f6rk had confessed that, when she was a kid, she considered Attenborough her \"rock star\". Attenborough stated that the singer \"is really quite enchanting\" and called her \"honey\" during the filming, reportedly because he could not pronounce her name properly. Bj\u00f6rk stated about the experience of the filming with Attenborough: \"He would close off and take in whatever I was saying, and then just come out with the most beautifully formed sentences you ever heard\". Director Hooper, whose father John had filmed Attenborough in different documentaries settled in Papua New Guinea, Mali and the Amazon rainforest, had stated:\n\n\"There is an unexpected chemistry and fun between these two unique characters. They are both icons of their own separate worlds of music and nature, and both excited and curious to explore how these two worlds come together. Seeing Bjork and Sir David laughing and engaging with each other on screen is simply magical, it was fascinating to have the chance to bring Sir David and Bjork together for the first time on television. They were both great fun to work with; Bjork fizzing with ideas for the film and Sir David bringing his passion and knowledge\".\nThe documentary was scheduled to air during November 2012 and to see a later limited cinema release in an extended cut. As of November 2012, the documentary was still in the editing. In June 2013, it was reported that the documentary would have its worldwide premiere at the Cortona Mix Festival in Italy. The festival then cancelled the projection. The documentary first aired on Channel 4 on 27 July 2013 as part of a series of documentaries called Mad4Music, now titled When Bj\u00f6rk Met Attenborough.When a crowdfunding was created on Kickstarter to fund the release of Biophilia on Android, one of the reward available for the backers who would have pledged \u00a3120 or more was one early viewing DVD copy of the documentary.

British-American neurologist Oliver Sacks was also reported to appear in the documentary, explaining \"the extraordinary and beneficial effects music has on our brains\". The documentary, made by the company Pulse Films, is the first time the British television channel and the company had collaborated. It was directed by Louise Hooper and executive produced by Lucas Ochoa, who commented about the project:\n\n\"Born from Bjork's revolutionary music project we are thrilled to be able to document this incredible journey with her; she is undeniably one of the most iconic figures in popular culture and truly pushes boundaries like no other artist does.\"\nThe English naturalist had previously provided the spoken introduction for the live shows and the apps. The two had long admired each other's works. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bj\u00f6rk had confessed that, when she was a kid, she considered Attenborough her \"rock star\". Attenborough stated that the singer \"is really quite enchanting\" and called her \"honey\" during the filming, reportedly because he could not pronounce her name properly. Bj\u00f6rk stated about the experience of the filming with Attenborough: \"He would close off and take in whatever I was saying, and then just come out with the most beautifully formed sentences you ever heard\". Director Hooper, whose father John had filmed Attenborough in different documentaries settled in Papua New Guinea, Mali and the Amazon rainforest, had stated:\n\n\"There is an unexpected chemistry and fun between these two unique characters. They are both icons of their own separate worlds of music and nature, and both excited and curious to explore how these two worlds come together. Seeing Bjork and Sir David laughing and engaging with each other on screen is simply magical, it was fascinating to have the chance to bring Sir David and Bjork together for the first time on television. They were both great fun to work with; Bjork fizzing with ideas for the film and Sir David bringing his passion and knowledge\".\nThe documentary was scheduled to air during November 2012 and to see a later limited cinema release in an extended cut. As of November 2012, the documentary was still in the editing. In June 2013, it was reported that the documentary would have its worldwide premiere at the Cortona Mix Festival in Italy. The festival then cancelled the projection. The documentary first aired on Channel 4 on 27 July 2013 as part of a series of documentaries called Mad4Music, now titled When Bj\u00f6rk Met Attenborough.When a crowdfunding was created on Kickstarter to fund the release of Biophilia on Android, one of the reward available for the backers who would have pledged \u00a3120 or more was one early viewing DVD copy of the documentary. After Bj\u00f6rk had found a cheaper way to transport the apps on Android, the funding was cancelled. On 21 March 2014, it was announced that the documentary would be released on 5 May 2014 on DVD and Blu-ray. Before the release of the DVD, the documentary was shown for three nights at the MK2 Grand Palais in Paris, and it was also shown during the We Love Green festival.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was recorded with their producer, Nigel Godrich, in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire. \nAfter the stress of promoting Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, the songwriter, Thom Yorke, wanted to depart from rock music. Drawing influence from electronic music, ambient music, krautrock, jazz and 20th-century classical music, Radiohead used instruments such as modular synthesisers, the ondes Martenot, brass and strings. They processed guitar sounds, incorporated samples and loops, and manipulated their recordings with software. Yorke wrote impersonal and abstract lyrics, cutting up phrases and assembling them at random.\nIn a departure from industry practice, Radiohead released no singles and conducted few interviews and photoshoots. Instead, they released short animations and became one of the first major acts to use the internet for promotion. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services, and Kid A was leaked before release. In 2000, Radiohead toured Europe in a custom-built tent without corporate logos.\nKid A debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and became Radiohead's first number-one album on the Billboard 200 in the US, where it sold more than 207,000 copies in its first week. Its new sound divided listeners, and some dismissed it as pretentious, deliberately obscure or derivative. However, at the end of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked it the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2020 Rolling Stone ranked it number 20 on its updated list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Like OK Computer, Kid A won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It was certified platinum in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the US and the UK.\nA second album of material from the sessions, Amnesiac, was released eight months later. Kid A Mnesia, an anniversary reissue compiling Kid A, Amnesiac and previously unreleased material, was released in 2021.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_7358", "text": "Following the critical and commercial success of their 1997 album OK Computer, the members of Radiohead suffered burnout.

He became disillusioned with the \"mythology\" of rock music, feeling the genre had \"run its course\".

Coliseum (now Ricoh Coliseum) in Toronto, was filmed and subsequently released on video as Live in Toronto and later as the bonus disc of the deluxe edition of the CD. In his 2002 autobiography White Line Fever, Lemmy recalls that at the Toronto show:\n\n\"Eddie was terrible and so was I - I got cramp halfway through the show and couldn't play.\"\nPromotion for the album went as far as the May 1982 edition of Rennbahn Express, an Austrian magazine, which included a free flexidisc with excerpts from \"Iron Fist\", \"Sex and Outrage\", \"Don't Let 'em Grind You Down\", and \"Loser\". Lemmy is interviewed by Robert Reumann in English and is overdubbed with a German translation. The release of the album prompted Bronze/Mercury in Canada to issue The Complete Mot\u00f6rhead Kit, which featured a limited-edition 12-inch vinyl containing \"Iron Fist\", \"Too Late, Too Late\", \"Remember Me, I'm Gone\", \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" (from the No Sleep 'til Hammersmith album), plus a tour programme, a tour poster, and an embroidered patch of the band's logo.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Engineer Robin Black had worked with the band in the mid-1970s on Sabotage and received a co-producer credit on Born Again.\nDuring recording, the band members lived at Manor Studio while Gillan chose to live outside the house, alone, in a marquee tent on the studio grounds: \"I thought he was joking, but when I arrived at the Manor I saw this marquee outside and I thought, fucking hell, he's serious. Ian had put up this big, huge tent. It had a cooking area and a bedroom and whatever else\", said Iommi. Butler said that the tent situation and Gillan's refusal to live with his new bandmates, in hindsight, likely indicated that the vocalist didn't view himself as a member of the band.\"Ian's lyrics were about sexual things or true facts, even about stuff that happened at The Manor there and then,\" Iommi said. \"They were good, but quite a departure from Geezer's and Ronnie's lyrics.\" For example, Gillan returned from a local pub one evening, took a car belonging to drummer Ward, and commenced racing around a go-cart track on the Manor Studio property. He crashed the car, which burst into flames after he escaped uninjured. He wrote the album's opening \"Trashed\" about the experience. Butler felt that Gillan's lyrics on tracks such as \"Digital Bitch\" and \"Keep It Warm\" were good, but much better suited to the musical style of Deep Purple than Black Sabbath.\"Disturbing the Priest\" was written after a rehearsal space \u2013 set up by Iommi in a small building near a local church \u2013 received noise complaints from the resident priests. \"We wanted this effect on 'Disturbing the Priest',\" recalled the guitarist, \"and Bill got this big bucket of water and he got this anvil. It was really heavy, and he'd got it hanging on a piece of rope and lower it in to get this effect: hit it and lower it in, and then lift it out again. It was a great effect, but it took hours to do.\"The band got along well, but it became apparent to all involved that Gillan's style did not quite mesh with the Sabbath sound. In 1992, he told director Martin Baker, \"I was the worst singer Black Sabbath ever had. It was totally, totally incompatible with any music they'd ever done. I didn't wear leathers, I wasn't of that image...I think the fans probably were in a total state of confusion.\" In 1992, Iommi admitted to Guitar World, \"Ian is a great singer, but he's from a completely different background, and it was difficult for him to come in and sing Sabbath material.\"\n\"I saw Ian go into the studio one day,\" Ward recalled, \"and I was fortunate and honoured, actually, to be part of a session. I watched him lay tracks on 'Keep It Warm'\u2026 I felt like Ian was Ian in that song\u2026 I watched this incredible transformation of this man that really, I felt, delicately put lyrics together. It made sense. I thought he did an excellent job. And I really dig that song too.\"\"I did some of the best drum work on that album\u2026\" Bill Ward recalled. \"On 'Disturbing the Priest', there were some polyrhythms and some counterpoint things that I was doing, and I was using at least twenty different pieces of percussion towards the end of that song\u2026 I was real proud of a lot of the work that I did. Some of it invariably got lost in the mix, but I know that it's printed on those tracks.\" Butler said that Ward began acting quite strangely during recording and was angrier than he had ever seen him. At one point the drummer began hallucinating and had to be hospitalized, and while he was there the band discovered his secret stash of vodka that he'd been consuming in secret at night. After being released from the hospital, Ward quit the band again and returned to America to sort out his issues, with his drum parts already recorded.When the band heard the final product, they were horrified at the muffled mix. In his autobiography, Iommi explains that Gillan inadvertently blew a couple of tweeters in the studio speakers by playing the backing tracks too loud and nobody noticed. \"We just thought it was a bit of a funny sound, but it went very wrong somewhere between the mix and the mastering and the pressing of that album...the sound was really dull and muffly. I didn't know about it, because we were already out on tour in Europe. By the time we heard the album, it was out and in the charts, but the sound was awful.\" Butler recalled listening to the tapes in his hotel room and being alarmed at how \"muffled and unclear\" the tracks were, but Iommi and Black assured him that the issue would be corrected during mixing. Ultimately, the issue never was corrected, with Butler lamenting years later that \"that's what happens when you don't hire a bona fide producer, like Martin Birch, to handle things.\"For all his misgivings, Gillan remembers the period fondly, stating in the Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992 documentary, \"But by God, we had a good year...And the songs, I think, were quite good.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_7444", "text": "Following the departure of vocalist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice in 1982, Sabbath's future was in doubt.

Engineer Robin Black had worked with the band in the mid-1970s on Sabotage and received a co-producer credit on Born Again.\nDuring recording, the band members lived at Manor Studio while Gillan chose to live outside the house, alone, in a marquee tent on the studio grounds: \"I thought he was joking, but when I arrived at the Manor I saw this marquee outside and I thought, fucking hell, he's serious. Ian had put up this big, huge tent. It had a cooking area and a bedroom and whatever else\", said Iommi. Butler said that the tent situation and Gillan's refusal to live with his new bandmates, in hindsight, likely indicated that the vocalist didn't view himself as a member of the band.\"Ian's lyrics were about sexual things or true facts, even about stuff that happened at The Manor there and then,\" Iommi said. \"They were good, but quite a departure from Geezer's and Ronnie's lyrics.\" For example, Gillan returned from a local pub one evening, took a car belonging to drummer Ward, and commenced racing around a go-cart track on the Manor Studio property. He crashed the car, which burst into flames after he escaped uninjured. He wrote the album's opening \"Trashed\" about the experience. Butler felt that Gillan's lyrics on tracks such as \"Digital Bitch\" and \"Keep It Warm\" were good, but much better suited to the musical style of Deep Purple than Black Sabbath.\"Disturbing the Priest\" was written after a rehearsal space \u2013 set up by Iommi in a small building near a local church \u2013 received noise complaints from the resident priests. \"We wanted this effect on 'Disturbing the Priest',\" recalled the guitarist, \"and Bill got this big bucket of water and he got this anvil. It was really heavy, and he'd got it hanging on a piece of rope and lower it in to get this effect: hit it and lower it in, and then lift it out again. It was a great effect, but it took hours to do.\"The band got along well, but it became apparent to all involved that Gillan's style did not quite mesh with the Sabbath sound. In 1992, he told director Martin Baker, \"I was the worst singer Black Sabbath ever had. It was totally, totally incompatible with any music they'd ever done. I didn't wear leathers, I wasn't of that image...I think the fans probably were in a total state of confusion.\" In 1992, Iommi admitted to Guitar World, \"Ian is a great singer, but he's from a completely different background, and it was difficult for him to come in and sing Sabbath material.\"\n\"I saw Ian go into the studio one day,\" Ward recalled, \"and I was fortunate and honoured, actually, to be part of a session. I watched him lay tracks on 'Keep It Warm'\u2026 I felt like Ian was Ian in that song\u2026 I watched this incredible transformation of this man that really, I felt, delicately put lyrics together. It made sense. I thought he did an excellent job. And I really dig that song too.\"\"I did some of the best drum work on that album\u2026\" Bill Ward recalled. \"On 'Disturbing the Priest', there were some polyrhythms and some counterpoint things that I was doing, and I was using at least twenty different pieces of percussion towards the end of that song\u2026 I was real proud of a lot of the work that I did. Some of it invariably got lost in the mix, but I know that it's printed on those tracks.\" Butler said that Ward began acting quite strangely during recording and was angrier than he had ever seen him. At one point the drummer began hallucinating and had to be hospitalized, and while he was there the band discovered his secret stash of vodka that he'd been consuming in secret at night. After being released from the hospital, Ward quit the band again and returned to America to sort out his issues, with his drum parts already recorded.When the band heard the final product, they were horrified at the muffled mix. In his autobiography, Iommi explains that Gillan inadvertently blew a couple of tweeters in the studio speakers by playing the backing tracks too loud and nobody noticed. \"We just thought it was a bit of a funny sound, but it went very wrong somewhere between the mix and the mastering and the pressing of that album...the sound was really dull and muffly. I didn't know about it, because we were already out on tour in Europe. By the time we heard the album, it was out and in the charts, but the sound was awful.\" Butler recalled listening to the tapes in his hotel room and being alarmed at how \"muffled and unclear\" the tracks were, but Iommi and Black assured him that the issue would be corrected during mixing. Ultimately, the issue never was corrected, with Butler lamenting years later that \"that's what happens when you don't hire a bona fide producer, like Martin Birch, to handle things.\"For all his misgivings, Gillan remembers the period fondly, stating in the Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992 documentary, \"But by God, we had a good year...And the songs, I think, were quite good.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was released on 30 May 2005 by Big Brother Recordings. It reached number one in the UK Albums Chart with first week sales of 237,865, and is the 32nd fastest selling album ever in the UK. The album entered the US charts at number 12, with 65,000 copies sold in the first week, the highest any Oasis album had reached there since 1997's Be Here Now, although its chart stay was brief. Don't Believe the Truth went triple platinum in the UK in the first week of 2006 (900,000+ sales), and in the US has sold more than 200,000 copies.As with the previous album, Don't Believe The Truth had significant writing contributions from members other than chief songwriter Noel Gallagher, and the album is the first where all duties were divided between the band members. On some of the tracks regular bass player Andy Bell handled guitar, while Gem Archer and Noel Gallagher contributed bass to other songs. Don't Believe the Truth is the first Oasis record to feature the drumming of Zak Starkey, an auxiliary member of Oasis, who performed and toured with them following the departure of longtime drummer Alan White, and appeared on the DVD praising all members' contributions. The album received positive reviews from critics, and many cited it as Oasis' best album in a decade.\nLiam Gallagher also had a larger impact on the album through his developing songwriting. Noel has said that the album is his favourite of Oasis' last four, because all members contributed to it. This, he claims, has given it a different feel from a typically Noel-written Oasis album.\nThe band embarked on a massive worldwide tour that started off at the London Astoria for their Don't Believe the Truth Tour, visiting 26 countries and playing to 3.2 million people at a total of 113 concerts.
