Branson had originally hoped to see a maiden spaceflight by 2010, but the date was delayed for several years, and then delayed again, primarily due to the October 2014 crash of VSS Enterprise.\nThe company did the early work on the satellite launch development of LauncherOne before this was hived off to a separate company, Virgin Orbit, in 2017. The company also has aspirations for suborbital transport and in 2017, Branson has said that Virgin Galactic was \"in the best position in the world\" to provide rocket-powered, point-to-point 3,000 mph (4,800 km/h) air travel.On 13 December 2018, VSS Unity achieved the project's first suborbital space flight, VSS Unity VP-03, with two pilots, reaching an altitude of 82.7 kilometres (51.4 mi), and officially entering outer space by U.S. standards. In February 2019, the project carried three people, including a passenger, on VSS Unity VF-01, with a member of the team floating within the cabin during a spaceflight that reached 89.9 kilometres (55.9 mi).

Founder Nate Silver left in April of 2023. On September 18, 2023, the original website domain at fivethirtyeight.com was closed and web traffic became redirected to ABC News pages. The logo was replaced, with the name 538 now used instead of FiveThirtyEight.\nThe website, which takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college, was founded on March 7, 2008, as a polling aggregation website with a blog created by analyst Nate Silver. In August 2010, the blog became a licensed feature of The New York Times online and was renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus. In July 2013, ESPN acquired FiveThirtyEight, hiring Silver as editor-in-chief and a contributor for ESPN.com; the new publication launched on March 17, 2014. Since then, the FiveThirtyEight blog has covered a broad spectrum of subjects including politics, sports, science, economics, and popular culture. In 2018, the operations were transferred from ESPN to sister property ABC News (also under parent The Walt Disney Company).\nDuring the presidential primaries and general election of 2008 the site compiled polling data through a unique methodology derived from Silver's experience in sabermetrics to \"balance out the polls with comparative demographic data\". Silver weighted \"each poll based on the pollster's historical track record, sample size, and recentness of the poll\".Since the 2008 election, the site has published articles\u2014typically creating or analyzing statistical information\u2014on a wide variety of topics in current politics and political news. These included a monthly update on the prospects for turnover in the Senate; federal economic policies; Congressional support for legislation; public support for health care reform, global warming legislation and LGBT rights; elections around the world; marijuana legalization; and numerous other topics. The site and its founder are best known for election forecasts, including the 2012 presidential election in which FiveThirtyEight correctly predicted the vote winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nFiveThirtyEight has won numerous awards. These include Bloggie Awards for Best Political Coverage in 2008 and Best Weblog about Politics in 2009 as well as Webbies for Best Political Blog in 2012 and 2013.

But especially in the early months of the election season polling in many states is sparse and episodic. The \"average\" of polls over an extended period (perhaps several weeks) would neither reveal the true state of voter preferences at the present time, nor provide an accurate forecast of the future. One approach to this problem was followed by Pollster.com: if enough polls were available, it computed a locally weighted moving average or LOESS.\nHowever, while adopting such an approach in his own analysis, Silver reasoned that there was additional information available in polls from \"similar\" states that might help to fill the gaps in information about the trends in a given state. Accordingly, he adapted an approach that he had previously used in his baseball forecasting: using nearest neighbor analysis he first identified \"most similar states\" and then factored into his electoral projections for a given state the polling information from \"similar states\".

Thus, his projections were not simply based on the polling trends in a given state.\nFurthermore, a basic intuition that Silver drew from his analysis of the 2008 Democratic party primary elections was that the voting history of a state or Congressional district provided clues to current voting. This is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the Democratic primaries in North Carolina and Indiana, for example. Using such information allowed Silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls.

Spycker Castle is the oldest profane structure on the Baltic Sea island of R\u00fcgen.\nSpycker was first recorded in 1318. It belonged at that time to the Stralsund patrician family, the von K\u00fclpens. In 1344 a daughter from the House of von K\u00fclpen married the Jasmunds. As a result, the Spyker branch of the von Jasmunds was founded which died without issue in 1648.\nAs a result of the Thirty Years' War, Pomerania, and hence R\u00fcgen, fell to Sweden under the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. As a reward for his wartime services, Queen Christine of Sweden gave the now empty seat of Spycker in 1649 to the Swedish field marshal and later governor-general of Swedish Pomerania, Carl Gustav Wrangel. The castle, originally furnished with a defensive moat, was remodelled after 1650 into its present appearance as a Renaissance schloss and painted in Swedish Falu red, which was atypical of R\u00fcgen. Fully sculptured stucco ceilings, unique in the Baltic region, date to around 1652.\nAfter the death of Carl Gustav Wrangel in 1676, the property passed to his daughter Eleanora-Sophia, wife of the Lord of Putbus. Eleanora-Sophia died in 1687, and the property went to the Swedish family of Brahe, with whom her older sister was connected by marriage. After its occupation by the Napoleonic troops in 1806/07 Spycker temporarily became the seat of the French governor of R\u00fcgen. In 1815, R\u00fcgen, which had hitherto been Swedish, was handed over to Prussia. Magnus Fredrik Brahe sold Spycker in 1817 and it came into the possession of Prince Wilhelm Malte I of Putbus.\nUntil the land reform in the Soviet Occupation Zone in 1945, the estate remained in the possession of the von Putbus family. In subsequent years, the castle was left to decay. From the 1960s until 1989, the East German trade union federation, FDGB,  used the castle as a holiday home. Since 1990, the castle has been used as a hotel and, in 1995, it was restored in line with its historical appearance. The hotel has 32 guest rooms.\nIn March 2006, the castle and its 67,000-square-foot estate was purchased at a forced sale by the present owner. The buyer was the architect, Dominik von Boettinger, who, in addition to the hotel and restaurant operation of the castle, also wants to use it as a cultural centre with exhibitions, concerts, readings, and a sculpture park.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The walled garden has a dominating 100-foot Wellingtonia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) in the centre of the lawn. The Geilston burn wends its way through the north of the estate towards the River Clyde in Cardross. The origins of the garden were most likely a result of the 1770 Montgomery Act, which saw the land around the house enclosed and planting undertaken.Geilston was opened to the public with the death of the last resident, Margaret Bell, who was a friend of Elizabeth Hendry, the owner of Geilston who bequeathed the house to the National trust for Scotland and gave her friend life rent of the house. The Hendrys moved into Geilston as tenants but the family bought the house from the Geils in 1922. The garden as it appears today was mostly laid out by Elizabeth Hendry and Margaret Bell. A cannon within the garden is said to have been a trophy from the Battle of Corunna brought to the Garden by Major General Geils, a previous owner of Geilston.The kitchen garden is the most labour-intensive area. It springs to life in April with the first sowings of carrots, parsnips and beetroot closely followed by transplanted brassicas. Visitors can buy in-season produce from a small stand at the garden's entrance.\nThe walled garden is the focus of spring colour with azaleas, heathers and unusual shrubs such as Cornus kousa 'Satomi'.

A few kilometers further south there is another feeder route to Kiel, the A 215, into the A7 at the interchange Bordesholm; however, this can only be reached from the south, likewise from the A 215 you can only reach the A7 in the south. South of Bordesholm, the highway has been continuously expanded to six lanes since 2014 due to the high traffic volume to Hamburg. Since 2016 and 2017, several sections have six lanes. Here, the motorway leads past the cities of Neum\u00fcnster, Bad Bramstedt and Norderstedt, before the hamlet of Schnelsen reaches Hamburg's urban area, and also Hamburg Airport. From the intersection Hamburg-Nordwest, where the A23 branches off towards Heide, the A7 is six lanes, but is currently being expanded to eight lanes.\nThe section through the city of Hamburg is characterized by an immense volume of traffic, congestion is the order of the day here. There are several reasons for this: the motorway runs through inner-city areas, there is a lot of holiday traffic on the route during school holidays, there are practically no opportunities for bypassing, the speed is permanently limited to 80 km / h as an urban area and the section is extended, South of the equipped with four tubes to two lanes Elbe tunnel leads the A7 on the highway Elbmarsch, the longest road bridge in Germany, right through the harbor area and the Harburg mountains to Lower Saxony. Via the corner junction A 261 you get to the A 1 to Bremen, at the following Maschener Kreuz on the A 39 to L\u00fcneburg.\nGoing through Hanover from Hamburg, the highway has six lanes, and it was downgraded to the four-lane section between Soltau and Walsrode the hard shoulder can be temporarily released as a third lane. It leads across the L\u00fcneburg Heath, partly with separate directional lanes. At the triangle Walsrode you reach the A 27 to Bremen and a few kilometers to the south, before reaching the capital of Lower Saxony, at the junction Hannover-Nord on the A 352, which connects to Hannover Airport and ends at the A 2, which leads to Dortmund. The following motorway junctions of the A7 provide a connection to the A37 Hanover city center and to Celle or A 2 Ruhrgebiet-Berlin dar. By the Altwarmb\u00fcchener Moor the highway leads east to Hanover; at the triangle Hannover-S\u00fcd, where the southern branch of the A 37 to the fair Hanover is connected only with the further south part of the A7.\nSouth of Hildesheim, the A7 enters a low mountain range and the terrain becomes hilly. The Salzgitter triangle also connects only the southern part of the A7 with the A 39 to Braunschweig and Salzgitter. Between the triangle Salzgitter and G\u00f6ttingen the highway is expands to six lanes. Passing the university town, the A 38 branches off at Dreieck Drammetal to Leipzig, then the A7 leads over steep gradients and slopes down into the Werratal near the town of Hann.

Between the interchange Kassel-Ost and the interchange Kassel-S\u00fcd, the A7 is being developed eight-lane for a future convergence with the then branching off to the east A44. In Kassel, the unfinished A 49 branches off, which will lead from completed completion to the Ohmtal triangle, which is to be built near Homberg (Ohm) between the junctions Alsfeld-West and Homberg (Ohm) on the A5. Between Kassel and Kirchheim the Kn\u00fcllgebirge is crossed. The Kirchheim triangle and the Hattenbacher triangle, which are close to each other and quite close to the geographic center of Germany, together form one of the most important motorway junctions of the state. The A 4 leads to the New L\u00e4nder and Eastern Europe, the A 5 to the Rhine-Main area and on to the border of Switzerland. South of the Hattenbacher triangle is the A7 sections four-lane expanded, leads past Fulda, where the A 66 branches off to Hanau and reaches Bavarian territory.\nCrossing the Rh\u00f6n Mountains, pass Schweinfurt (cross with the A 70 to Bayreuth) and W\u00fcrzburg to the Biebelried intersection, where the A 3 Ruhrgebiet-Frankfurt am Main-N\u00fcrnberg-Passau is crossed. This was the southern end of the A7 for a long time. The completion of the south in the 1980s leads past Rothenburg ob der Tauber on the western edge of the Frankenh\u00f6he to the freeway junction Feuchtwangen / Crailsheim (intersection with the A 6 Saarbr\u00fccken-Heilbronn-Nuremberg- Waidhaus) and partly Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg area over the Ostalb, for the crossing even two tunnels had to be built, via Aalen to Ulm. At the motorway junction Ulm / Elchingen, the A8 (Luxembourg-Karlsruhe-Stuttgart-Munich-Salzburg) is crossed. South of Ulm it goes through the Illertal parallel to the river back to Bavaria, via Memmingen (cross with the A 96 Lindau Munich) and Kempten (branch to the A 980 to Oberstdorf), over the 2009 completed section through the Reinertshoftunnel to the edge of the foot of the Alps.

On the route between Flensburg and Hamburg, for example, it follows the historic Ochsenweg and can be described as its successor in terms of its importance as a trade route from Scandinavia to the south. Plans for a highway from Hamburg to the south were made in the framework of the HaFraBa from 1926. This project is considered to be the predecessor of the A7 between Hamburg and the Hattenbacher Dreieck.\nThe first section opened from G\u00f6ttingen to Bad Hersfeld in 1937. Construction of the section between Bad Hersfeld and W\u00fcrzburg (Strecke 46) began in 1937 with various bridge structures built however the road wasn't completed before war broke out in 1939 and construction was stopped before being fully abandon in 1940. After World War 2 the route of A7 was altered leaving some of the abandoned bridge structures of Strecke 46 to be preserved as historic monuments.\nFrom the 1950s, the highway was built between the A 1 south of Hamburg and the existing part of the A7 near G\u00f6ttingen and opened in sections. At the A1 the \"Horster triangle\" was created as the new beginning of the A7. From the south (Hanover) coming vehicles had there at the threading to the A1 in the direction of west (Bremen) drive through a steep curve for many years.\nThe section Echte-Seesen was opened on 14 November 1959. The section Seesen Hildesheim was opened on 15 December 1960 by Secretary of Transportation Seebohm.\nFrom 1956, the seven sections between Hamburg and Hanover were handed over to traffic. In 1960, the 21 km section between junction Berkhof and the cross Hannover / Kirchhorst was opened last.\nThe four remaining sections in between were opened in 1958. The gap closure was achieved with the 35 km section between motorway junction Hannover / Kirchhorst and junction Hildesheim in 1962.\nIn the 1960s, the A7 was then built on a slightly different route. The first to be opened in 1965 was the 10.9 km section north of the Biebelried interchange to the junction W\u00fcrzburg / Estenfeld. 1966 followed the adjacent section to the present cross Schweinfurt / Werneck and the 14.8 km long section between Fulda North and Fulda South. The northernmost section from the Hattenbacher Triangle to Fulda (32 km) and the middle section between Fulda and Schweinfurt (68 km) were finally handed over to traffic in 1968.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the highway was built in the Hamburg area and the so-called north axis to Denmark and handed over to traffic. The construction took place in nine sections. An important milestone was the opening of the New Elbe Tunnel in 1975. On 13 July 1976, Ernst Haar, Parliamentary State Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Transport, and Schleswig-Holstein's Minister of the Interior Rudolf Titzck solemnly opened the motorway section from Tarp to Handewitt. Only in 1978, the last vacant space between Tarp and Schuby was closed, so that the highway could be driven from Hamburg to the federal border.\nOn 13 June 1978, Queen Margrethe II and President Walter Scheel opened the border crossing Ellund, accompanied by Prime Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and the Flensburg Mayor Ingrid Gross. At 10.55 clock they officially released the freeway and passport control, at 12.32 clock rolled the first car through the new border crossing. Ellund developed into the most important transit point of German-Danish border traffic. In 1979, 3.2 million travelers passed the counters; until 1997, the number had more than quintupled at 16.7 million.\nIn the preliminary draft for a motor vehicle road network of Germany of the study company for automotive road construction (STUFA) of 1926 a highway W\u00fcrzburg-Ulm-Lindau was provided, detail planning took place from 1935 to 1941. In 1969, the states of Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg were able to agree on a line parallel to the federal highway 19.\nFrom 1972 first sections could be released. It started with the Berkheim section to junction Memmingen-S\u00fcd (9.4 km) and the first 27.1 km long directional lane between Bad Gr\u00f6nenbach and Kempten-Leubas.\nMajor sections were between Kreuz Biebelried and junction Uffenheim-Langensteinach (34.7 km) in 1980, the southern extension to the junction Feuchtwangen (42.1 km) in 1985 and further to the junction Heidenheim (59.6 km) opened in 1987. Since the last 6.8 kilometers to the junction Oy-Mittelberg were already released a year ago, the highway was already passable from Denmark to the Allg\u00e4u.\nIn 1992, the A7 was extended by another 4.9 km to Nesselwang. A few meters west of the junction of the same name is the highest motorway point in Germany: \"914.081 m above sea level. NN \".\nIn July 1999, the opening of the border tunnel F\u00fcssen to Tyrol followed with a tube and two lanes. The tunnel is supposed to relieve the surrounding communities of the high traffic volume during vacation time. In 2005, the northern adjoining first directional lane was opened up to the county road at Gunzenberg. Until September 2009, traffic from the end of the motorway at Nesselwang was routed via various routes for cars and trucks to the border tunnel, which often led to traffic jams.\nOn 1 September 2009 was the official inauguration of the last 15-kilometer section, which was released more than a year late. The viaduct Enzenstetten was initially only one-way passable, as the construction-performing consortium could not complete it on time.

There are several reasons for this: the motorway runs through inner-city areas, there is a lot of holiday traffic on the route during school holidays, there are practically no opportunities for bypassing, the speed is permanently limited to 80 km / h as an urban area and the section is extended, South of the equipped with four tubes to two lanes Elbe tunnel leads the A7 on the highway Elbmarsch, the longest road bridge in Germany, right through the harbor area and the Harburg mountains to Lower Saxony. Via the corner junction A 261 you get to the A 1 to Bremen, at the following Maschener Kreuz on the A 39 to L\u00fcneburg.\nGoing through Hanover from Hamburg, the highway has six lanes, and it was downgraded to the four-lane section between Soltau and Walsrode the hard shoulder can be temporarily released as a third lane. It leads across the L\u00fcneburg Heath, partly with separate directional lanes. At the triangle Walsrode you reach the A 27 to Bremen and a few kilometers to the south, before reaching the capital of Lower Saxony, at the junction Hannover-Nord on the A 352, which connects to Hannover Airport and ends at the A 2, which leads to Dortmund. The following motorway junctions of the A7 provide a connection to the A37 Hanover city center and to Celle or A 2 Ruhrgebiet-Berlin dar. By the Altwarmb\u00fcchener Moor the highway leads east to Hanover; at the triangle Hannover-S\u00fcd, where the southern branch of the A 37 to the fair Hanover is connected only with the further south part of the A7.\nSouth of Hildesheim, the A7 enters a low mountain range and the terrain becomes hilly. The Salzgitter triangle also connects only the southern part of the A7 with the A 39 to Braunschweig and Salzgitter. Between the triangle Salzgitter and G\u00f6ttingen the highway is expands to six lanes. Passing the university town, the A 38 branches off at Dreieck Drammetal to Leipzig, then the A7 leads over steep gradients and slopes down into the Werratal near the town of Hann. M\u00fcnden and continues onto Hesse.\nAt Kassel, it is the largest district, from there you can get on the A44 in the direction of the west to the Ruhr area and in some years, when the extension Kassel-Herleshausen will be completed, also in the direction of Eisenach. Between the interchange Kassel-Ost and the interchange Kassel-S\u00fcd, the A7 is being developed eight-lane for a future convergence with the then branching off to the east A44. In Kassel, the unfinished A 49 branches off, which will lead from completed completion to the Ohmtal triangle, which is to be built near Homberg (Ohm) between the junctions Alsfeld-West and Homberg (Ohm) on the A5. Between Kassel and Kirchheim the Kn\u00fcllgebirge is crossed. The Kirchheim triangle and the Hattenbacher triangle, which are close to each other and quite close to the geographic center of Germany, together form one of the most important motorway junctions of the state. The A 4 leads to the New L\u00e4nder and Eastern Europe, the A 5 to the Rhine-Main area and on to the border of Switzerland. South of the Hattenbacher triangle is the A7 sections four-lane expanded, leads past Fulda, where the A 66 branches off to Hanau and reaches Bavarian territory.\nCrossing the Rh\u00f6n Mountains, pass Schweinfurt (cross with the A 70 to Bayreuth) and W\u00fcrzburg to the Biebelried intersection, where the A 3 Ruhrgebiet-Frankfurt am Main-N\u00fcrnberg-Passau is crossed. This was the southern end of the A7 for a long time. The completion of the south in the 1980s leads past Rothenburg ob der Tauber on the western edge of the Frankenh\u00f6he to the freeway junction Feuchtwangen / Crailsheim (intersection with the A 6 Saarbr\u00fccken-Heilbronn-Nuremberg- Waidhaus) and partly Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg area over the Ostalb, for the crossing even two tunnels had to be built, via Aalen to Ulm. At the motorway junction Ulm / Elchingen, the A8 (Luxembourg-Karlsruhe-Stuttgart-Munich-Salzburg) is crossed. South of Ulm it goes through the Illertal parallel to the river back to Bavaria, via Memmingen (cross with the A 96 Lindau Munich) and Kempten (branch to the A 980 to Oberstdorf), over the 2009 completed section through the Reinertshoftunnel to the edge of the foot of the Alps. There, the lane becomes one lane and flows into the border tunnel F\u00fcssen to Austria.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_42972", "text": "The highway replaced as a trunk connection the imperial or federal roads 76, 77, 205 and 4 (Flensburg-Hamburg), 3 (Hamburg-Kassel) and 27 (G\u00f6ttingen-W\u00fcrzburg), which in turn went back to medieval precursors. On the route between Flensburg and Hamburg, for example, it follows the historic Ochsenweg and can be described as its successor in terms of its importance as a trade route from Scandinavia to the south. Plans for a highway from Hamburg to the south were made in the framework of the HaFraBa from 1926. This project is considered to be the predecessor of the A7 between Hamburg and the Hattenbacher Dreieck.\nThe first section opened from G\u00f6ttingen to Bad Hersfeld in 1937. Construction of the section between Bad Hersfeld and W\u00fcrzburg (Strecke 46) began in 1937 with various bridge structures built however the road wasn't completed before war broke out in 1939 and construction was stopped before being fully abandon in 1940. After World War 2 the route of A7 was altered leaving some of the abandoned bridge structures of Strecke 46 to be preserved as historic monuments.\nFrom the 1950s, the highway was built between the A 1 south of Hamburg and the existing part of the A7 near G\u00f6ttingen and opened in sections. At the A1 the \"Horster triangle\" was created as the new beginning of the A7. From the south (Hanover) coming vehicles had there at the threading to the A1 in the direction of west (Bremen) drive through a steep curve for many years.\nThe section Echte-Seesen was opened on 14 November 1959. The section Seesen Hildesheim was opened on 15 December 1960 by Secretary of Transportation Seebohm.\nFrom 1956, the seven sections between Hamburg and Hanover were handed over to traffic. In 1960, the 21 km section between junction Berkhof and the cross Hannover / Kirchhorst was opened last.\nThe four remaining sections in between were opened in 1958. The gap closure was achieved with the 35 km section between motorway junction Hannover / Kirchhorst and junction Hildesheim in 1962.\nIn the 1960s, the A7 was then built on a slightly different route. The first to be opened in 1965 was the 10.9 km section north of the Biebelried interchange to the junction W\u00fcrzburg / Estenfeld. 1966 followed the adjacent section to the present cross Schweinfurt / Werneck and the 14.8 km long section between Fulda North and Fulda South. The northernmost section from the Hattenbacher Triangle to Fulda (32 km) and the middle section between Fulda and Schweinfurt (68 km) were finally handed over to traffic in 1968.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the highway was built in the Hamburg area and the so-called north axis to Denmark and handed over to traffic. The construction took place in nine sections. An important milestone was the opening of the New Elbe Tunnel in 1975. On 13 July 1976, Ernst Haar, Parliamentary State Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Transport, and Schleswig-Holstein's Minister of the Interior Rudolf Titzck solemnly opened the motorway section from Tarp to Handewitt. Only in 1978, the last vacant space between Tarp and Schuby was closed, so that the highway could be driven from Hamburg to the federal border.\nOn 13 June 1978, Queen Margrethe II and President Walter Scheel opened the border crossing Ellund, accompanied by Prime Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and the Flensburg Mayor Ingrid Gross. At 10.55 clock they officially released the freeway and passport control, at 12.32 clock rolled the first car through the new border crossing. Ellund developed into the most important transit point of German-Danish border traffic. In 1979, 3.2 million travelers passed the counters; until 1997, the number had more than quintupled at 16.7 million.\nIn the preliminary draft for a motor vehicle road network of Germany of the study company for automotive road construction (STUFA) of 1926 a highway W\u00fcrzburg-Ulm-Lindau was provided, detail planning took place from 1935 to 1941. In 1969, the states of Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg were able to agree on a line parallel to the federal highway 19.\nFrom 1972 first sections could be released. It started with the Berkheim section to junction Memmingen-S\u00fcd (9.4 km) and the first 27.1 km long directional lane between Bad Gr\u00f6nenbach and Kempten-Leubas.\nMajor sections were between Kreuz Biebelried and junction Uffenheim-Langensteinach (34.7 km) in 1980, the southern extension to the junction Feuchtwangen (42.1 km) in 1985 and further to the junction Heidenheim (59.6 km) opened in 1987. Since the last 6.8 kilometers to the junction Oy-Mittelberg were already released a year ago, the highway was already passable from Denmark to the Allg\u00e4u.\nIn 1992, the A7 was extended by another 4.9 km to Nesselwang. A few meters west of the junction of the same name is the highest motorway point in Germany: \"914.081 m above sea level. NN \".\nIn July 1999, the opening of the border tunnel F\u00fcssen to Tyrol followed with a tube and two lanes. The tunnel is supposed to relieve the surrounding communities of the high traffic volume during vacation time. In 2005, the northern adjoining first directional lane was opened up to the county road at Gunzenberg. Until September 2009, traffic from the end of the motorway at Nesselwang was routed via various routes for cars and trucks to the border tunnel, which often led to traffic jams.\nOn 1 September 2009 was the official inauguration of the last 15-kilometer section, which was released more than a year late. The viaduct Enzenstetten was initially only one-way passable, as the construction-performing consortium could not complete it on time. The second half of the bridge went into operation in December 2010, to the Austrian border.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Known for most of its length as Hanover Pike, the highway runs 19.16 miles (30.84 km) from MD 140 in Reisterstown north to the Pennsylvania state line near Melrose, where the highway continues as Pennsylvania Route 94 (PA 94). MD 30 is a major, two-lane regional highway in western Baltimore County and northeastern Carroll County. Locally, the highway serves the towns of Manchester and Hampstead; the latter town is bypassed by the highway but served by a business route. Regionally, MD 30 connects Reisterstown and Baltimore with Hanover, Pennsylvania.\nMD 30 originated in the colonial era as part of a wagon road connecting the fledgling port of Baltimore with the new settlement that was to become Hanover. This highway was improved as a turnpike in the 19th century. MD 30 was constructed as a state road by the Maryland State Roads Commission in the late 1910s and early 1920s, and it became one of the original state-numbered highways in 1927. The state highway was relocated and widened near Reisterstown in the late 1930s and along the rest of its route in the early 1950s. The Hampstead Bypass was planned as early as the 1960s to ameliorate the increasing congestion along the MD 30 corridor that was only exacerbated when Interstate 795 (I-795) was completed to Reisterstown in the late 1980s. However, the construction of the bypass was continually delayed due to environmental issues and politics. The bypass was finally constructed between 2006 and 2009; the old highway through Hampstead became MD 30 Business.

While the business route heads north through the center of Hampstead, MD 30 passes to the west of the town on the Hampstead Bypass, which has two lanes but expands to a three- or four-lane divided highway for short stretches on either side of its roundabouts. The state highway passes under Houcksville Road and over Shiloh Road before meeting MD 482 (Hampstead\u2013Mexico Road) at a roundabout. MD 30 reunites with the northern end of MD 30 Business at a roundabout in the community of Greenmount. The state highway, once again named Hanover Pike, has a short four-lane divided section through a commercial area before reducing to a two-lane undivided road.MD 30 enters the town of Manchester as Main Street as the highway passes west of Manchester Valley High School. In the center of town, the highway intersects Westminster Street and York Street; along the latter street is Charlotte's Quest Nature Center. MD 30 meets the northern end of MD 27 (Manchester Road) on the northern edge of downtown and the southern end of MD 86 (Lineboro Road) at the north town limit. There is no direct access from southbound MD 30 to northbound MD 86; that movement is made via Hallie Avenue, the next intersection to the south. MD 30 crosses Dug Hill Ridge just north of MD 86 and passes through the community of Melrose, where the highway intersects the eastern terminus of MD 496 (Bachmans Valley Road) and Wentz Road. The state highway follows the upper reaches of the South Branch of Gunpowder Falls through a ridge to the river's source before reaching its northern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line. The highway continues as PA 94 (Baltimore Pike) through southwestern York County to Hanover.MD 30 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length except for the short segment in Reisterstown south of MD 128 and MD 795; that short segment is a National Highway System principal arterial.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is the third stadium in the club's existence, the previous two being Raikes Hall Gardens and the Athletic Grounds.\nLargely unchanged since the 1960s, the stadium began a redevelopment phase in the early 2000s. A temporary East Stand was erected before the start of the 2010\u201311 season, the club's debut in the Premier League. It is still in place today. The three permanent stands are named the Stan Mortensen North Stand (denoted by the acronym \"B.F.C.\" spelled out in white seats, the Jimmy Armfield South Stand (with \"ARMFIELD\" spelled out in white seats) and the Sir Stanley Matthews West Stand (with one of the club's nicknames, \"SEASIDERS\", spelled out in white seats).\nThe record attendance at Bloomfield Road is 38,098, when Blackpool played Wolverhampton Wanderers on 17 September 1955.The stadium hosted three matches of the 2005 UEFA Women's Championship. It has also been the venue for the final of the Northern Rail Cup, a rugby league tournament.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_43148", "text": "Before moving to Bloomfield Road, Blackpool had called two other grounds home during their short existence. Firstly, between 1896 and 1897, they played their fifteen home Football League matches at Raikes Hall Gardens (also known as the Pleasure Gardens). In 1897, they moved to the Athletic Grounds at the present-day Stanley Park, which hosted thirty-two League matches over two seasons. After a short spell back at Raikes Hall Gardens in 1899, during their season out of the League, and again for all but the first home game of the 1900\u201301 campaign, Blackpool made the permanent move to Bloomfield Road.\nThe ground was originally known as Gamble's Field, so named for the farmer who owned the land, when South Shore played there in the Lancashire League in 1899.\nThe first competitive game played at the ground took place on 21 October 1899, when South Shore played the 1st South Lancashire Regiment. A comment at the time was: \"The new ground was not quite finished on Saturday and the linesman had plenty to do besides watching the game to keep the spectators from getting over the line. The grandstand was not up, but it is expected to be ready for next Saturday. A bar is going to be erected and two dressing tents.\" The official opening of the ground did indeed occur on 28 October 1899, when South Shore entertained Newton Heath in an FA Cup tie.When Blackpool merged with South Shore in December 1899, the former club moved into the latter's ground and changed the name to Bloomfield Road. Additionally, the two clubs amalgamated with the Lancashire League fixtures of Blackpool, because they were deemed easier than those of South Shore.The first game after the merger took place on 23 December. Horwich R.M.I., with only ten men in their line-up, were the visitors. Blackpool won 8\u20130. The ground, at this time, had a small wooden grandstand along the western side of the pitch, which seated about three hundred spectators. A perimeter fence ran around the rest of the pitch to keep supporters off the playing surface. Walking to the game would have been very different from today. Coming from the south, supporters would have had to navigate their way through row after row of allotments along Central Drive from Waterloo Road. All behind the west side of the ground were railway sidings and tracks. Henry Street was only partially built up, and behind the north end of the ground lay open space and the town's waste disposer and the corporation stables.After this match, Blackpool returned to play at their Raikes Hall ground, where the Christmas Day game against Oswaldtwistle Rovers resulted in a \"better attendance than ever\". Raikes Hall was used for the season's remaining home games, and it was not until a practice match on 25 August 1900 that the club, then back in the Second Division, returned to Bloomfield Road.At this time there was only one stand at the ground, a small structure on the western side, which held about 300 seated. Gainsborough Trinity were the first visitors to Bloomfield Road for a Football League game. On 8 September 1900, they drew 1\u20131 with the Seasiders, in front of what was a \"good\" attendance of \"just under 2,000\". It was noted that the ground \"conveyed the impression that at some remote period of its history it had been a ploughed field\".Once again, Blackpool returned to playing their home games at Raikes Hall for the remainder of the season. \"We shall not easily forget Saturday's match, or rather, to be more accurate, the conditions under which it was played\", one critic said. \"Unfortunately for the club, the game had to be played at Bloomfield Road, and if there is one ground in this town unsuitable for the purpose for which it is used, this is surely the one. It is out of the way, all the players and most of the committee and the spectators declared that it was impossible to play on such a pitch; and the provision for the Press was absolutely nil.\" In addition, commenting on the attendance, it was thought that \"the figure would have been nearly double had Raikes been available\".The only reason that the opening fixture was played at Bloomfield Road is that, with it being the tail end of the summer season, Raikes Hall Pleasure Gardens were still being used to entertain the public and as such the football field was unavailable. In fact, it had been agreed pre-season that Raikes Hall would be permanently used as the home ground, but that \"as soon as certain improvements are completed, a move will be made to the South Shore ground\". These improvements were not made to the satisfaction of the club, and they remained at Raikes Hall.\nIt was not until the start of the 1901\u201302 season that Bloomfield Road became the permanent home of Blackpool Football Club. The club won its first League game at Bloomfield Road on 12 October 1901, defeating Doncaster Rovers 3\u20131.\nIn 1906, the local Press were pleading with the club to provide a decent Press box, as they found themselves watching the games from the touchline. The following year, a paddock was built in front of the stand to up the capacity. A decade later, however, a serious fire all but destroyed it, necessitating a complete rebuild. Two years later, the Spion Kop, the former South Stand, was built, holding about 1,000 standing spectators. Along the east side of the ground, the concreted East Paddock was built, costing roughly \u00a33,000, which nearly bankrupted the club but raised the ground to have a capacity of 18,000.\nAlso in 1906, a 2,000-capacity stand was constructed on the north side of the ground. This new stand was named the Motor Stand and made Bloomfield Road one of the few grounds in England to have stands on all four sides of the ground. Partly erected, it was opened for the first time on 10 November for the visit of West Bromwich Albion. The club organist a whist drive at the Conservative Club to help defray the expense. The stand was borrowed from the Blackpool Corporation and practically filled the north side of the ground. It was purchased from the council in June 1908 at a cost of \u00a3100.On 13 January 1917, a fire in the West Stand, likely caused by the dressing-room heating system, badly damaged the structure. When the fire brigade arrived, the stand was a blazing inferno with a northerly wind causing the flames to completely destroy the entire southern end, including both the original secretary's office, the boardroom, including club records, many silver cups and a collection of historical photographs that adorned the office. It resulted in a rebuilding programme that eventually saw the ground constructed along the lines that remained for the rest of the century.\nIn 1925, a new South Stand was built to provide a new boardroom, offices, dressing rooms, baths and refreshment bars. It cost just over \u00a313,000 and held 4,000 people, bringing the total ground capacity to well over 20,000. Also this year, a new directors' box was built in the North-West Corner of the ground. It was used for the first time for the visit of Southampton on 29 August 1925. Ernest Lawson commented in the Gazette & Herald: \"It's a nice box they have placed themselves in; it must be for safety, for it is far enough out of the way! But of what are they frightened?\" He offered an answer at a later date: \"The Let Me Smoke railway stokers are a choking nuisance. Now we know from what the directors are protecting themselves.\" He was referring to the smoke that regularly drifted in at the north-west corner of the ground, caused by passing steam trains. Lawson added: \"The crowd do, however, have the last laugh when the wind comes in from the east!\"An England v. Ireland amateur international was staged at the ground on 12 November 1927.\nFor the opening game of the 1929\u201330 campaign, a visit of Millwall Athletic on 31 August, the new West Stand was opened for the first time. Eventually, the playing surface was extended by twenty yards to the north to make room for a paddock in front of the South Stand.Also in 1929, Eli Percival, a general dealer whose business was based on Elizabeth Street, gifted the club the oak panelling that lined the walls of the Bloomfield Road boardroom until 2003. The wood had been salvaged from the wreckage of Horatio Nelson's one-time flagship HMS Foudroyant, which was wrecked near the Metropole Hotel on 16 June 1897.With promotion to the First Division in 1930 the locals raised some money to build a massive terrace at the north (Tower) end of the ground which could hold around 12,000 standing spectators, increasing the ground's total capacity to over 30,000. The original hill was constructed largely out of cinders and sand and packed together with railway sleepers to hold the extra spectators. The stand was opened for the visit of eventual champions Arsenal on 30 August 1930, and a record 28,723 paid \u00a31,896 to watch the proceedings. The Gunners also helped set the record twice in the two seasons that followed: 29,576 in 1930\u201331 and 30,218 in 1931\u201332. The stand had the club's name painted on its rear. The Motor Stand, which had previously occupied the spot, was moved into the North-West Corner, where it stayed until 1985. The East Stand (or \"Scratching Sheds\") was covered once the team's fortunes increased.\nOn 17 October 1932, the only full international game took place at Bloomfield Road: England v. Ireland. The attendance was 23,000.FK Austria Wien were the first continental side to visit Bloomfield Road. The friendly, which took place on 9 December 1935, attracted a crowd of over 5,000. The hosts won 4\u20133.On 11 January 1936, Blackpool hosted Margate in the FA Cup in what is believed to be the first game captured on film at Bloomfield Road. The tie, which Blackpool won 3\u20131, was filmed by the Tower Company and was later shown at the Winter Gardens and Grand Theatre.On 12 May 1937, Bloomfield Road hosted a series of events as part of the coronation of George VI and Elizabeth. The day started at 09:45 with a parade of all the children taking part, followed by a civic ceremony by the mayor. A display of national dances in costume took place before the ensemble Grand Finale Parade. A thousand children from the junior schools of Blackpool formed a living Union Jack on the pitch during the national anthem.Lancashire rivals Burnley travelled to Bloomfield Road on 2 December 1944 to contest a Football League North fixture during World War II. The programme noted that the ground had been loaned \"by kind permission\" of Air Commodore A. Macgregor. The Royal Air Force had requisitioned the ground for the war years, as they had done previously during World War I. Blackpool's considerable debts were virtually cleared by the time the hostilities ended. The visitors won 2\u20130.\nOn 18 October 1950, Bloomfield Road hosted a Football League versus Irish League exhibition match. Liverpool's centre-forward Albert Stubbins netted five times in the Football League's 6\u20133 victory.With an extension of the East Paddock, the capacity of the ground was raised to 38,000 in 1954. Additional seating in the West Stand was also added around this time.\nThe record attendance at Bloomfield Road occurred when Wolverhampton Wanderers visited on 17 September 1955. In front of 38,098, the hosts won 2\u20131.\nOn 24 May 1957, Barcelona approached Blackpool to play a match at Bloomfield Road. The kick-off was scheduled for 22:00, but the game actually got underway at 22:40. As the hosts entered the stadium, the visiting Spanish support greeted them with firecrackers. Blackpool rested nine players, but managed a 3\u20133 draw with the visitors, who had beaten Real Madrid 6\u20131 in their previous match. Blackpool's goals came from Ken Smith, Ernie Taylor and Sandy Harris.To inaugurate the new floodlighting system at the ground, a friendly was held against Scottish League champions Hearts. The system was one of the most modern in the country, and, because of the town's geographical location, special safeguards had been made so that the 145-feet-high pylons could withstand the coastal weather. The manufacturers guaranteed that the galvanised tubular-steel towers would not only resist corrosion but would also be able to withstand winds of between 90 and 100 miles per hour. In addition, the piles for each pylon had been sunk to a depth of 37 feet to ensure they had a firm base. Each of the pylons at that time carried 36 1,500-watt lamps, giving a combined power of 216 kilowatts.Bloomfield Road hosted its 1,000th Football League game on 10 September 1960, with a visit by Lancashire neighbours Bolton Wanderers. The game was the first to be televised in England. It was broadcast on ITV, billed as The Big Game, and three cameras were sited at the back of the Spion Kop. Coverage was scheduled for the last five minutes of the first half and the whole of the second. Bolton won the game 1\u20130.The capacity of the ground was reduced to 30,000 in the late 1960s when new seating was installed. During the following decade, the board introduced seats in the East Paddock, a move that proved so unpopular that it was reversed within twelve months.\nA roof was put up over the Spion Kop at the north end of the ground, with BLACKPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB painted on its rear; however, it was taken down in 1981 after only twenty years. The council thought it was dangerous, but the club could not afford to repair the roof, so it was removed, leaving the visiting fans exposed to the elements for the next two decades. A knock-on effect was the removal of seats that had been put into the East Stand. These seats were supposedly a very poor idea as the first three rows were below pitch level, thus providing a poor vantage point from which to watch games.\nThe final Christmas Day fixture at Bloomfield Road occurred in 1965, with the visit of Blackburn Rovers. The Football League announced: \"Christmas Day matches were dropped from our calendar when it became obvious to all concerned \u2014 spectators, players and officials alike \u2014 that people preferred to spend the day at home.\"Ammonia was thrown on the Spion Kop towards the end of a 7 October 1968 Second Division derby with Blackburn Rovers. Numerous fans were injured by the indiscriminate throwing of the substance. Several were taken to hospital, and four spectators, including a police officer, were detained overnight. The incident made front-page headlines nationally as \"alarming and frightening developments\" in football hooliganism. \"A night of soccer madness and the madness did not end in the ground, for further incidents occurred outside.\"The Kop Shop opened for the first time for the visit of Everton on 19 September 1970. Located in a disused ticket office in the north-east corner of the ground, the shop was run by the supporters' club and made available a full range of football souvenirs, including badges, pens, scarves and pennants.\nOn 24 August 1974, 17-year-old Blackpool fan Kevin Olsson was fatally stabbed at the rear of the Spion Kop during a game against Bolton Wanderers.On 17 March 1986, the club's directors announced that they were ready to sell the Bloomfield Road ground as a site for a supermarket. A lucrative deal was being discussed with a Manchester development company. Forthcoming safety measures meant that both the West and South stands would likely be condemned the following year, otherwise the club would have to spend \u00a32 million on improvements. With the sale, the directors wanted to clear the football club's debts and move to nearby Blackpool Borough's rugby ground on Princess Street. The scheme was rejected by the town council the following month, at which point the board of directors decided to put the club up for sale.In the summer of 1989, the club had to spend \"thousands\" on repairs to the ground, with the South Stand roof being the main concern. Further safety work was necessary in order for the stadium to continue staging League football. Also that year, the North-West Stand was condemned in the wake of stricter safety standards. Demolition began almost immediately, and temporary seating was installed to accommodate visiting support to the ground.Bloomfield Road became the first ground in England to witness police in full riot gear. Before, during and after the Third Division encounter with Birmingham City there were numerous disturbances and skirmishes around the town and police reinforcements were drafted in from all over the Fylde. At the game, visiting fans began rioting on the open Spion Kop terracing, which was allocated exclusively for away supporters. After some delay, the police finally entered the terraces and restored order.In the 1990s, with Bloomfield Road in an increasing state of disrepair, new safety measures reduced the capacity from 18,000 to 12,000, and then down to 9,000. The western half of the Kop was closed, with the eastern half open only to visiting support and the East Paddock became segregated. The atmosphere came almost exclusively from the south end, unless there was a large away following.\nOn 10 August 1991, seven days before the season kicked off with the visit of Walsall, county council inspectors were at the ground to give the club's new police control box the final approval. Chief executive David Hatton commented: \"We are working on the match being on at home next week as planned. We had a visit from the county council on Friday and it was very encouraging.\"On 2 November 1991, a draw with Scarborough marked a year's passing since Blackpool were last beaten in the League at Bloomfield Road.Former chairman Owen Oyston submitted plans, on several occasions, to build a new 40,000 all-seater stadium adjoining a large entertainment complex. Outline planning permission for the new ground, which was to be built at nearby Whyndyke Farm, was granted in June 1992.\nThe \"Golden Gamble\" match-day draw scheme was introduced for the first time for the visit of 4 September 1993 visit of Barnet to Bloomfield Road. Fans could purchase lottery tickets for \u00a31 before each home game, and a draw at half-time by the guest of the day gives punters a chance to win 50% of the gross take, up to \u00a32,000. The scheme is still in operation today. This fund-raising scheme followed \"Goldbond\", a weekly draw that was launched three years earlier.On 16 October 1993, full plans for the club's proposed new multi-purpose stadium were submitted to the town's mayor by Owen Oyston and Stanley Matthews. The plans included a 20,000 capacity stadium with retractable roof, 92 executive boxes in the North and South stands, and a twelve-storey luxury hotel with 115 rooms with balconies overlooking the pitch. Leisure facilities included an Olympic-sized swimming pool, indoor five-a-side football area, gymnasium and keep-fit area. Every seat would have access to restaurants, bars and fast-food outlets. However, in 1996 Oyston was convicted of rape and jailed for six years, and nothing further was heard about the move to Whyndyke Farm.\nA supplement in Blackpool's matchday programme for the visit of Cardiff City on 11 March 2000 revealed the long-awaited plans for the redevelopment of the ground. It confirmed that plans had been submitted to the borough council and both the chief executive and principal planning officer said that the proposals were both \"realistic and attractive\". The architects TTH and developer Ballast Wiltshire were both involved in the Stadium of Light development in Sunderland. The overall capacity was announced as 15,254.On 23 May 2000, the club was given the go-ahead for the redevelopment of Bloomfield Road. A unanimous vote by the resort's councillors sealed the fate of plans to replace the existing stadium with an \u00a311 million state-of-the-art structure.In 2000 and 2001 respectively, the Spion Kop and West Stand were demolished to make way for the new stands. The Kop was closed after the 8 May visit of Colchester United. The pitch was moved slightly north and west to make room for expansion on the south and east sides of the ground in future years.\nOn 7 August 2001, a pre-season friendly against Spanish side Athletic Bilbao was held at Bloomfield Road. The game ended 2\u20132.The West Stand was completed in the summer of 2002 and was officially opened on 6 August, with former Seasiders player Keith Walwyn the guest of honour for a friendly against Blackburn Rovers. Lord Pendry unveiled a plaque above the main entrance celebrating the Football Foundation's contribution to the new stadium. The South Stand, meanwhile, was granted a reprieve which meant it would re-open for visiting supporters for the forthcoming 2002\u201303 campaign. All matches would be all-ticket for visiting support. If a club requested more than the 1,500 allocation, Blackpool would open the East Paddock north section, thus allowing a further 1,000 away support.On 25 June 2003, fans were allowed into the ground to take a final look around the South and East stands before their demolition. Former Blackpool player Dave Durie was also in attendance.In July 2003, Bloomfield Road was granted a licence to hold marriage ceremonies.\nThe stadium was used for two matches during the 2005 UEFA Women's Championship. Blackpool Rugby League Club used the stadium for their home matches in National League Two in the 2005 and 2006 seasons and since 2005 it has staged the annual National League Cup final.\nThe stadium hosted a 2004\u201305 Victory Shield match between England under-16 team and Scotland under-16 team on 26 November 2004.On 22 September 2005, Bloomfield Road hosted its 2,000th Football League match. Brentford were the visitors for a game that ended 0\u20130.\n\nOn 11 October 2007, England under-16s drew 2\u20132 with Northern Ireland under-16s in a Victory Shield 2007-08 match at Bloomfield Road. The match was televised live on Sky Sports.In January 2007, Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston reacted angrily to news that the town had lost out to Manchester in the race for the UK's first supercasino. He was concerned that the news could drive potential investors away from purchasing space in the South Stand. Oyston had previously insisted that work would only begin on the long-awaited structure when office space had been sold.In March 2008, following news that Whyndyke Farm is to be the home for a new psychiatric hospital to replace the Parkwood unit at Victoria Hospital, and that the site is also earmarked for new housing, Karl Oyston confirmed that plans for a move to a new stadium at Whyndyke Farm were unlikely to ever be revived.On 25 April 2009, after his Nottingham Forest team drew 1\u20131 with Blackpool at Bloomfield Road, Billy Davies complained about the state of the stadium and its pitch: \"It is a disgrace and so are some of the surroundings. It was not rolled and not prepared properly. It was not a pitch on which to play football.\" After the season ended, the pitch was relaid.The FA chose the stadium to host England women's opening Group 5 qualifying game for the 2011 World Cup against Malta on 25 October 2009, which England won 8\u20130 in front of a crowd of 3,681.On 2 May 2010, Bloomfield Road experienced its highest attendance for thirty years. 12,296 (11,192 home; 1,104 away) people watched Blackpool's 1\u20131 draw with Bristol City as the hosts secured a final-day play-off spot. This beat the previous high of 10,427, when Rotherham United visited on 20 August 1980.On 24 May, at the civic reception held in the club's honour after they gained promotion to the Premier League, manager Ian Holloway thanked the fans \"for making our ground somewhere to feel safe and express yourself.\"\nOn 26 May, Karl Oyston revealed that work would begin on the East Stand, which would complete the Bloomfield Road redevelopment, \"as soon as is realistically possible\". Work commenced on 14 June. In addition, the seating in the North and West stands will be replaced gradually through the season due to the fading of their tangerine colour, as well as electronic turnstiles, a new pitch sprinkler system, large video screen, new media and medical facilities, new floodlighting, further hospitality areas in the South Stand and enlarged dugouts. The pitch was also relaid.\nA webcam was fitted so fans could keep track of the progress of construction in the East Stand.\nWigan Athletic were in line to be the first visitors to Bloomfield Road as a Premier League ground on 14 August, but on 12 July it was announced that the East Stand would not be ready in time; as a result, the fixture was reversed.The club requested 1,500\u20132,000 fans to test the temporary East Stand with free entry to the Lancashire Senior Cup game against Morecambe on 25 August in order for the safety certificates to be issued.England manager Fabio Capello was present at Bloomfield Road for its debut hosting of a Premier League game. Fulham were the visitors on 28 August 2010, and the Italian was reportedly in attendance to watch the Cottagers' Bobby Zamora.On 20 November 2010, Prince William attended the fixture between Blackpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers while in town for the stag party of one of his friends. Scotland manager Craig Levein was also in attendance.The ground was chosen to host Carlisle United's home FA Cup third round tie in January 2016 against Yeovil Town, with the Cumbrians' Brunton Park affected by flooding in the city.In June 2019, the ground came into the control of Simon Sadler, after he acquired a controlling 96.2% stake in Blackpool F.C.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_43149", "text": "The main entrance to the ground used to be on Bloomfield Road, via the South Stand; however, the development of the ground that began in the first few years of the 21st century meant it is now from Seasiders Way, via the Matthews Stand on the west side of the ground.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_43148", "text": "Before moving to Bloomfield Road, Blackpool had called two other grounds home during their short existence. Firstly, between 1896 and 1897, they played their fifteen home Football League matches at Raikes Hall Gardens (also known as the Pleasure Gardens). In 1897, they moved to the Athletic Grounds at the present-day Stanley Park, which hosted thirty-two League matches over two seasons. After a short spell back at Raikes Hall Gardens in 1899, during their season out of the League, and again for all but the first home game of the 1900\u201301 campaign, Blackpool made the permanent move to Bloomfield Road.\nThe ground was originally known as Gamble's Field, so named for the farmer who owned the land, when South Shore played there in the Lancashire League in 1899.\nThe first competitive game played at the ground took place on 21 October 1899, when South Shore played the 1st South Lancashire Regiment. A comment at the time was: \"The new ground was not quite finished on Saturday and the linesman had plenty to do besides watching the game to keep the spectators from getting over the line. The grandstand was not up, but it is expected to be ready for next Saturday. A bar is going to be erected and two dressing tents.\" The official opening of the ground did indeed occur on 28 October 1899, when South Shore entertained Newton Heath in an FA Cup tie.When Blackpool merged with South Shore in December 1899, the former club moved into the latter's ground and changed the name to Bloomfield Road. Additionally, the two clubs amalgamated with the Lancashire League fixtures of Blackpool, because they were deemed easier than those of South Shore.The first game after the merger took place on 23 December. Horwich R.M.I., with only ten men in their line-up, were the visitors. Blackpool won 8\u20130. The ground, at this time, had a small wooden grandstand along the western side of the pitch, which seated about three hundred spectators. A perimeter fence ran around the rest of the pitch to keep supporters off the playing surface. Walking to the game would have been very different from today. Coming from the south, supporters would have had to navigate their way through row after row of allotments along Central Drive from Waterloo Road. All behind the west side of the ground were railway sidings and tracks. Henry Street was only partially built up, and behind the north end of the ground lay open space and the town's waste disposer and the corporation stables.After this match, Blackpool returned to play at their Raikes Hall ground, where the Christmas Day game against Oswaldtwistle Rovers resulted in a \"better attendance than ever\". Raikes Hall was used for the season's remaining home games, and it was not until a practice match on 25 August 1900 that the club, then back in the Second Division, returned to Bloomfield Road.At this time there was only one stand at the ground, a small structure on the western side, which held about 300 seated. Gainsborough Trinity were the first visitors to Bloomfield Road for a Football League game. On 8 September 1900, they drew 1\u20131 with the Seasiders, in front of what was a \"good\" attendance of \"just under 2,000\". It was noted that the ground \"conveyed the impression that at some remote period of its history it had been a ploughed field\".Once again, Blackpool returned to playing their home games at Raikes Hall for the remainder of the season. \"We shall not easily forget Saturday's match, or rather, to be more accurate, the conditions under which it was played\", one critic said. \"Unfortunately for the club, the game had to be played at Bloomfield Road, and if there is one ground in this town unsuitable for the purpose for which it is used, this is surely the one. It is out of the way, all the players and most of the committee and the spectators declared that it was impossible to play on such a pitch; and the provision for the Press was absolutely nil.\" In addition, commenting on the attendance, it was thought that \"the figure would have been nearly double had Raikes been available\".The only reason that the opening fixture was played at Bloomfield Road is that, with it being the tail end of the summer season, Raikes Hall Pleasure Gardens were still being used to entertain the public and as such the football field was unavailable. In fact, it had been agreed pre-season that Raikes Hall would be permanently used as the home ground, but that \"as soon as certain improvements are completed, a move will be made to the South Shore ground\". These improvements were not made to the satisfaction of the club, and they remained at Raikes Hall.\nIt was not until the start of the 1901\u201302 season that Bloomfield Road became the permanent home of Blackpool Football Club. The club won its first League game at Bloomfield Road on 12 October 1901, defeating Doncaster Rovers 3\u20131.\nIn 1906, the local Press were pleading with the club to provide a decent Press box, as they found themselves watching the games from the touchline. The following year, a paddock was built in front of the stand to up the capacity. A decade later, however, a serious fire all but destroyed it, necessitating a complete rebuild. Two years later, the Spion Kop, the former South Stand, was built, holding about 1,000 standing spectators. Along the east side of the ground, the concreted East Paddock was built, costing roughly \u00a33,000, which nearly bankrupted the club but raised the ground to have a capacity of 18,000.\nAlso in 1906, a 2,000-capacity stand was constructed on the north side of the ground. This new stand was named the Motor Stand and made Bloomfield Road one of the few grounds in England to have stands on all four sides of the ground. Partly erected, it was opened for the first time on 10 November for the visit of West Bromwich Albion. The club organist a whist drive at the Conservative Club to help defray the expense. The stand was borrowed from the Blackpool Corporation and practically filled the north side of the ground. It was purchased from the council in June 1908 at a cost of \u00a3100.On 13 January 1917, a fire in the West Stand, likely caused by the dressing-room heating system, badly damaged the structure. When the fire brigade arrived, the stand was a blazing inferno with a northerly wind causing the flames to completely destroy the entire southern end, including both the original secretary's office, the boardroom, including club records, many silver cups and a collection of historical photographs that adorned the office. It resulted in a rebuilding programme that eventually saw the ground constructed along the lines that remained for the rest of the century.\nIn 1925, a new South Stand was built to provide a new boardroom, offices, dressing rooms, baths and refreshment bars. It cost just over \u00a313,000 and held 4,000 people, bringing the total ground capacity to well over 20,000. Also this year, a new directors' box was built in the North-West Corner of the ground. It was used for the first time for the visit of Southampton on 29 August 1925. Ernest Lawson commented in the Gazette & Herald: \"It's a nice box they have placed themselves in; it must be for safety, for it is far enough out of the way! But of what are they frightened?\" He offered an answer at a later date: \"The Let Me Smoke railway stokers are a choking nuisance. Now we know from what the directors are protecting themselves.\" He was referring to the smoke that regularly drifted in at the north-west corner of the ground, caused by passing steam trains. Lawson added: \"The crowd do, however, have the last laugh when the wind comes in from the east!\"An England v. Ireland amateur international was staged at the ground on 12 November 1927.\nFor the opening game of the 1929\u201330 campaign, a visit of Millwall Athletic on 31 August, the new West Stand was opened for the first time. Eventually, the playing surface was extended by twenty yards to the north to make room for a paddock in front of the South Stand.Also in 1929, Eli Percival, a general dealer whose business was based on Elizabeth Street, gifted the club the oak panelling that lined the walls of the Bloomfield Road boardroom until 2003. The wood had been salvaged from the wreckage of Horatio Nelson's one-time flagship HMS Foudroyant, which was wrecked near the Metropole Hotel on 16 June 1897.With promotion to the First Division in 1930 the locals raised some money to build a massive terrace at the north (Tower) end of the ground which could hold around 12,000 standing spectators, increasing the ground's total capacity to over 30,000. The original hill was constructed largely out of cinders and sand and packed together with railway sleepers to hold the extra spectators. The stand was opened for the visit of eventual champions Arsenal on 30 August 1930, and a record 28,723 paid \u00a31,896 to watch the proceedings. The Gunners also helped set the record twice in the two seasons that followed: 29,576 in 1930\u201331 and 30,218 in 1931\u201332. The stand had the club's name painted on its rear. The Motor Stand, which had previously occupied the spot, was moved into the North-West Corner, where it stayed until 1985. The East Stand (or \"Scratching Sheds\") was covered once the team's fortunes increased.\nOn 17 October 1932, the only full international game took place at Bloomfield Road: England v. Ireland.

In addition, the piles for each pylon had been sunk to a depth of 37 feet to ensure they had a firm base. Each of the pylons at that time carried 36 1,500-watt lamps, giving a combined power of 216 kilowatts.Bloomfield Road hosted its 1,000th Football League game on 10 September 1960, with a visit by Lancashire neighbours Bolton Wanderers. The game was the first to be televised in England. It was broadcast on ITV, billed as The Big Game, and three cameras were sited at the back of the Spion Kop.

Located in a disused ticket office in the north-east corner of the ground, the shop was run by the supporters' club and made available a full range of football souvenirs, including badges, pens, scarves and pennants.\nOn 24 August 1974, 17-year-old Blackpool fan Kevin Olsson was fatally stabbed at the rear of the Spion Kop during a game against Bolton Wanderers.On 17 March 1986, the club's directors announced that they were ready to sell the Bloomfield Road ground as a site for a supermarket. A lucrative deal was being discussed with a Manchester development company. Forthcoming safety measures meant that both the West and South stands would likely be condemned the following year, otherwise the club would have to spend \u00a32 million on improvements. With the sale, the directors wanted to clear the football club's debts and move to nearby Blackpool Borough's rugby ground on Princess Street. The scheme was rejected by the town council the following month, at which point the board of directors decided to put the club up for sale.In the summer of 1989, the club had to spend \"thousands\" on repairs to the ground, with the South Stand roof being the main concern. Further safety work was necessary in order for the stadium to continue staging League football. Also that year, the North-West Stand was condemned in the wake of stricter safety standards. Demolition began almost immediately, and temporary seating was installed to accommodate visiting support to the ground.Bloomfield Road became the first ground in England to witness police in full riot gear. Before, during and after the Third Division encounter with Birmingham City there were numerous disturbances and skirmishes around the town and police reinforcements were drafted in from all over the Fylde. At the game, visiting fans began rioting on the open Spion Kop terracing, which was allocated exclusively for away supporters. After some delay, the police finally entered the terraces and restored order.In the 1990s, with Bloomfield Road in an increasing state of disrepair, new safety measures reduced the capacity from 18,000 to 12,000, and then down to 9,000. The western half of the Kop was closed, with the eastern half open only to visiting support and the East Paddock became segregated. The atmosphere came almost exclusively from the south end, unless there was a large away following.\nOn 10 August 1991, seven days before the season kicked off with the visit of Walsall, county council inspectors were at the ground to give the club's new police control box the final approval. Chief executive David Hatton commented: \"We are working on the match being on at home next week as planned. We had a visit from the county council on Friday and it was very encouraging.\"On 2 November 1991, a draw with Scarborough marked a year's passing since Blackpool were last beaten in the League at Bloomfield Road.Former chairman Owen Oyston submitted plans, on several occasions, to build a new 40,000 all-seater stadium adjoining a large entertainment complex. Outline planning permission for the new ground, which was to be built at nearby Whyndyke Farm, was granted in June 1992.\nThe \"Golden Gamble\" match-day draw scheme was introduced for the first time for the visit of 4 September 1993 visit of Barnet to Bloomfield Road. Fans could purchase lottery tickets for \u00a31 before each home game, and a draw at half-time by the guest of the day gives punters a chance to win 50% of the gross take, up to \u00a32,000. The scheme is still in operation today. This fund-raising scheme followed \"Goldbond\", a weekly draw that was launched three years earlier.On 16 October 1993, full plans for the club's proposed new multi-purpose stadium were submitted to the town's mayor by Owen Oyston and Stanley Matthews. The plans included a 20,000 capacity stadium with retractable roof, 92 executive boxes in the North and South stands, and a twelve-storey luxury hotel with 115 rooms with balconies overlooking the pitch. Leisure facilities included an Olympic-sized swimming pool, indoor five-a-side football area, gymnasium and keep-fit area. Every seat would have access to restaurants, bars and fast-food outlets. However, in 1996 Oyston was convicted of rape and jailed for six years, and nothing further was heard about the move to Whyndyke Farm.\nA supplement in Blackpool's matchday programme for the visit of Cardiff City on 11 March 2000 revealed the long-awaited plans for the redevelopment of the ground. It confirmed that plans had been submitted to the borough council and both the chief executive and principal planning officer said that the proposals were both \"realistic and attractive\". The architects TTH and developer Ballast Wiltshire were both involved in the Stadium of Light development in Sunderland. The overall capacity was announced as 15,254.On 23 May 2000, the club was given the go-ahead for the redevelopment of Bloomfield Road. A unanimous vote by the resort's councillors sealed the fate of plans to replace the existing stadium with an \u00a311 million state-of-the-art structure.In 2000 and 2001 respectively, the Spion Kop and West Stand were demolished to make way for the new stands. The Kop was closed after the 8 May visit of Colchester United. The pitch was moved slightly north and west to make room for expansion on the south and east sides of the ground in future years.\nOn 7 August 2001, a pre-season friendly against Spanish side Athletic Bilbao was held at Bloomfield Road. The game ended 2\u20132.The West Stand was completed in the summer of 2002 and was officially opened on 6 August, with former Seasiders player Keith Walwyn the guest of honour for a friendly against Blackburn Rovers. Lord Pendry unveiled a plaque above the main entrance celebrating the Football Foundation's contribution to the new stadium. The South Stand, meanwhile, was granted a reprieve which meant it would re-open for visiting supporters for the forthcoming 2002\u201303 campaign. All matches would be all-ticket for visiting support. If a club requested more than the 1,500 allocation, Blackpool would open the East Paddock north section, thus allowing a further 1,000 away support.On 25 June 2003, fans were allowed into the ground to take a final look around the South and East stands before their demolition. Former Blackpool player Dave Durie was also in attendance.In July 2003, Bloomfield Road was granted a licence to hold marriage ceremonies.\nThe stadium was used for two matches during the 2005 UEFA Women's Championship. Blackpool Rugby League Club used the stadium for their home matches in National League Two in the 2005 and 2006 seasons and since 2005 it has staged the annual National League Cup final.\nThe stadium hosted a 2004\u201305 Victory Shield match between England under-16 team and Scotland under-16 team on 26 November 2004.On 22 September 2005, Bloomfield Road hosted its 2,000th Football League match. Brentford were the visitors for a game that ended 0\u20130.\n\nOn 11 October 2007, England under-16s drew 2\u20132 with Northern Ireland under-16s in a Victory Shield 2007-08 match at Bloomfield Road. The match was televised live on Sky Sports.In January 2007, Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston reacted angrily to news that the town had lost out to Manchester in the race for the UK's first supercasino. He was concerned that the news could drive potential investors away from purchasing space in the South Stand. Oyston had previously insisted that work would only begin on the long-awaited structure when office space had been sold.In March 2008, following news that Whyndyke Farm is to be the home for a new psychiatric hospital to replace the Parkwood unit at Victoria Hospital, and that the site is also earmarked for new housing, Karl Oyston confirmed that plans for a move to a new stadium at Whyndyke Farm were unlikely to ever be revived.On 25 April 2009, after his Nottingham Forest team drew 1\u20131 with Blackpool at Bloomfield Road, Billy Davies complained about the state of the stadium and its pitch: \"It is a disgrace and so are some of the surroundings. It was not rolled and not prepared properly. It was not a pitch on which to play football.\" After the season ended, the pitch was relaid.The FA chose the stadium to host England women's opening Group 5 qualifying game for the 2011 World Cup against Malta on 25 October 2009, which England won 8\u20130 in front of a crowd of 3,681.On 2 May 2010, Bloomfield Road experienced its highest attendance for thirty years. 12,296 (11,192 home; 1,104 away) people watched Blackpool's 1\u20131 draw with Bristol City as the hosts secured a final-day play-off spot. This beat the previous high of 10,427, when Rotherham United visited on 20 August 1980.On 24 May, at the civic reception held in the club's honour after they gained promotion to the Premier League, manager Ian Holloway thanked the fans \"for making our ground somewhere to feel safe and express yourself.\"\nOn 26 May, Karl Oyston revealed that work would begin on the East Stand, which would complete the Bloomfield Road redevelopment, \"as soon as is realistically possible\". Work commenced on 14 June. In addition, the seating in the North and West stands will be replaced gradually through the season due to the fading of their tangerine colour, as well as electronic turnstiles, a new pitch sprinkler system, large video screen, new media and medical facilities, new floodlighting, further hospitality areas in the South Stand and enlarged dugouts. The pitch was also relaid.\nA webcam was fitted so fans could keep track of the progress of construction in the East Stand.\nWigan Athletic were in line to be the first visitors to Bloomfield Road as a Premier League ground on 14 August, but on 12 July it was announced that the East Stand would not be ready in time; as a result, the fixture was reversed.The club requested 1,500\u20132,000 fans to test the temporary East Stand with free entry to the Lancashire Senior Cup game against Morecambe on 25 August in order for the safety certificates to be issued.England manager Fabio Capello was present at Bloomfield Road for its debut hosting of a Premier League game. Fulham were the visitors on 28 August 2010, and the Italian was reportedly in attendance to watch the Cottagers' Bobby Zamora.On 20 November 2010, Prince William attended the fixture between Blackpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers while in town for the stag party of one of his friends. Scotland manager Craig Levein was also in attendance.The ground was chosen to host Carlisle United's home FA Cup third round tie in January 2016 against Yeovil Town, with the Cumbrians' Brunton Park affected by flooding in the city.In June 2019, the ground came into the control of Simon Sadler, after he acquired a controlling 96.2% stake in Blackpool F.C.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_43149", "text": "The main entrance to the ground used to be on Bloomfield Road, via the South Stand; however, the development of the ground that began in the first few years of the 21st century meant it is now from Seasiders Way, via the Matthews Stand on the west side of the ground.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is one of the busiest mixed-traffic railway routes in Europe, carrying a mixture of intercity rail, regional rail, commuter rail and rail freight traffic. The core route of the WCML runs from London to Glasgow for 399 miles (642 km) and was opened from 1837 to 1869. With additional lines deviating to Northampton, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Edinburgh, this totals a route mileage of 700 miles (1,127 km). The Glasgow\u2013Edinburgh via Carstairs line connects the WCML to Edinburgh. However, the main London\u2013Edinburgh route is the East Coast Main Line. Several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Coventry, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing links to more rural towns.\nIt is one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 40% of all UK rail freight traffic. The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. A number of railway writers refer to it as \"The Premier line\".The WCML was not originally conceived as a single route, but was built as a patchwork of local lines which were linked together, built by various companies, the largest of which amalgamated in 1846 to create the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), which then gradually absorbed most of the others; the exceptions were the Caledonian Railway in Scotland, and the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) which both remained independent until 1923. The core route was mostly built between the 1830s and 1850s, but several cut-off routes and branches were built in later decades. In 1923, the entire route came under the ownership of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) when the railway companies were grouped under the Railways Act 1921. The LMS itself was nationalised in 1947 to form part of British Railways (BR). \nAs the WCML is the most important long-distance railway trunk route in the UK, BR carried out an extensive programme of modernisation of it between the late 1950s and early 1970s, which included full overhead electrification of the route, and the introduction of modern intercity passenger services at speeds of up to 110 mph (177 km/h). Further abortive modernisation schemes were proposed, including the introduction of the Advanced Passenger Train (APT) in the 1980s; an ill-fated high speed train which used tilting technology, which was required to allow faster speeds on the curving route, and the abortive InterCity 250 project in the early-1990s. Further modernisation of the route finally occurred during the 2000s in the period of privatisation, which saw speeds raised further to 125 mph (201 km/h) and the introduction of tilting Class 390 Pendolino trains.   \nAs much of the line has a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), it meets the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers with tilting mechanisms operated by Avanti West Coast travel at that speed.

Originally designed as a baseball venue, the stadium was expanded in later years to accommodate the addition of a professional football team to the city, the Denver Broncos, as well as to improve Denver's hopes of landing a Major League Baseball team. Although the stadium was originally built as a baseball-specific venue, it became more popular as a pro-football stadium despite hosting both sports for a majority of its life.\nThe Broncos called Mile High Stadium home from their beginning in the AFL in 1960 until 2000. The Bears, who changed their name to the Zephyrs in 1984, continued to play in the stadium until 1992 when the franchise was moved to New Orleans. The move was precipitated by the awarding of a Major League Baseball franchise to the city of Denver, and in 1993 the Colorado Rockies season opened in Mile High. The team played the 1993 and strike-shortened 1994 seasons in Mile High setting MLB attendance records while Coors Field was being constructed in downtown Denver.\nIn addition to the Broncos, Bears/Zephyrs, and Rockies, Mile High Stadium was home to several other professional teams during the course of its history. The Denver Gold of the United States Football League called Mile High home from 1983 to 1985, and the stadium played host to the inaugural USFL championship game on July 17, 1983.

The 92,746-seat stadium is the ninth-largest football stadium in the NCAA (and in the United States), and the 17th-largest such stadium in the world. Architecturally, the stadium is known for its numerous expansions over the years that have been carefully planned to fit with the existing look of the stadium. The view of Georgia's campus and rolling hills from the open west end zone has led many to refer to Sanford Stadium as college football's \"most beautiful on-campus stadium\", while the surrounding pageantry has made it noteworthy as one of college football's \"best, loudest, and most intimidating atmospheres\". Games played there are said to be played \"between the hedges\" due to the field being surrounded by privet hedges, which have been a part of the design of the stadium since it opened in 1929. The current hedges were planted in 1996 after the originals were taken out to accommodate the football tournaments for the 1996 Summer Olympics.\nUnlike most stadiums that have artificial playing surfaces, Sanford Stadium from the outset had, and continues to have, a natural grass surface, planted with Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_43276", "text": "The stadium is named for Dr. Steadman Vincent Sanford, an early major force behind UGA athletics. Sanford arrived at the University of Georgia as an English instructor in 1903. He later became the faculty representative to the athletics committee and would eventually become president of the university and chancellor of the entire University System of Georgia. In 1911, he moved the university's football venue from its first location, Herty Field, to a location at the center of campus which was named Sanford Field in his honor.\n\nIn those early years of football, Georgia played a series of controversial games against in-state rival Georgia Tech. Sanford Field was too small to accommodate the large crowds, forcing Georgia to travel to Tech's Grant Field in Atlanta every year. Sanford wanted Georgia to have a venue that would equal Tech's, and the \"final straw\" came in 1927 when UGA's undefeated (9\u20130) team traveled to Tech and lost 12\u20130. It was alleged that Tech watered the field all night to slow UGA's running backs. Afterwards, Sanford vowed to \"build a stadium bigger than Tech\", and play the game at Athens every other year.To fund his vision, Sanford had an idea that members of the athletic association would sign notes guaranteeing a bank loan to fund the stadium construction. Those guarantors would be granted lifetime seats. The response was overwhelming, and in 1928 a loan of $150,000 supported by fans and alumni allowed construction to begin on a stadium whose total cost was $360,000.Near the existing Sanford Field was a low area between the historic North Campus and the Science Campus (to the south) with a small creek (Tanyard Creek) running through it, creating a clearly preferable choice for the location of the new stadium. This natural valley containing Tanyard Creek would result in reduced costs, as stands could be built on the rising sides of the hill, while the creek could be enclosed in a concrete culvert, on top of which the field would be constructed. The architect for the stadium was TC Atwood of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where North Carolina's Kenan Memorial Stadium had just been completed with a similar design. The 30,000-seat stadium was built in large part with convict labor, as were many public works projects of that era.\nWhile the location was, then as now, preferable for construction, the result is an uphill walk in any direction leaving the stadium.\n\nThe stadium was completed on time, and UGA convinced perennial powerhouse Yale, which has historically maintained close ties with UGA, to be their first opponent in the new stadium. (This also was Yale's first ever football game played in the South.) On October 12, 1929, a capacity crowd of over 30,000 paid $3 per ticket to watch the Bulldogs, under coach Harry Mehre, beat Yale 15\u20130 in Sanford Stadium's dedication game. The crowd was at the time the largest to witness a college football game in the South, and governors from all nine southern states also were in attendance. Yale donated its half of the game receipts to UGA to help pay off the construction loans, which would subsequently be completely repaid in just five years. Dr. Sanford also was at this game, and attended many Georgia games at the stadium named in his honor until his death on September 15, 1945.\n\nSanford Stadium's hedges have encircled the field since the stadium's first game against Yale in 1929. The idea to put hedges around the field came from the Business Manager of the UGA Athletic Department, Charlie Martin. Martin claimed to have received inspiration for the idea during a visit to the Rose Bowl, where he saw the hedge of roses in that stadium. Roses were not a suitable choice for the climate in Athens, so privet hedges were used instead. Six other SEC stadiums have copied UGA and now have hedges, making this feature no longer unique to UGA, but Georgia has the only one that completely surrounds the playing field.\nThere is a disagreement as to the exact type of hedge planted at Sanford Stadium. The UGA Media Guide claims that the hedge is an \"English privet hedge\". A county extension agent in Athens, however, claims online that the hedge is composed of Chinese privet, Ligustrum sinense.In addition to being a cosmetic touch, the hedges have proven to be an effective (though perhaps unintended) measure of crowd control. While not apparent in photos, the hedges are growing around a chain link fence which stops people who try to push through to the field.  Even though a major traffic path to exit the stadium from both stands runs directly alongside the hedges, fans have only stormed the field and torn down the goalposts once in the entire history of Sanford Stadium.  This occurred after the Georgia vs. Tennessee game on Oct. 7, 2000.\nIn May 2019, university officials announced that the playing surface of Sanford Stadium would be named in honor of former long time Bulldog head coach and athletic director Vince Dooley. Official dedication of Dooley Field took place in a pregame ceremony on the Bulldogs' 2019 home opener on September 7.On September 21, 2019, Sanford Stadium would set an attendance record of 93,246 in the Bulldogs victory against #7 Notre Dame.

Soon after the arrival of head coach Vince Dooley in 1964, UGA began updating Sanford Stadium, removing the field-level lighting (which obstructed views from the stands) and adding 7,621 bleacher seats in the end zones, which brought total capacity to 43,621. Architects Heery and Heery of Atlanta were then hired to plan a major expansion. This expansion planning was very tricky, since by that time the stadium was encroached by academic buildings. The plans went forward, however, and the grandstand seats were double-decked in 1967 without the need to demolish or alter any of the surrounding buildings.

It was spurred by then-Major John Boyd's 'energy-maneuverability' (E-M) theory, which indicated that excessive weight would have severely debilitating consequences on the maneuverability of an aircraft. Boyd's design called for a light-weight fighter with a high thrust-to-weight ratio, high maneuverability, and a gross weight of less than 20,000 lb (9,100 kg), half that of its counterpart, the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. It resulted in the development of the General Dynamics YF-16 and Northrop YF-17. Late in the program, in 1974, with the promise of European sales, the Air Force changed the program name to Air Combat Fighter (ACF), and committed to purchasing 650 models of the YF-16, adopted as the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The U.S. Navy adopted a modified version of the YF-17 as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The club's traditional kit consists of red shirts, white shorts and red socks, and their most commonly used nickname is The Addicks. Charlton share local rivalries with fellow South London clubs Crystal Palace and Millwall.\nThe club was founded on 9 June 1905 and turned professional in 1920. They spent one season in the Kent League and one season in the Southern League, before being invited to join the newly-formed Football League Third Division South in 1921. They won the division in the 1928\u201329 season, and again in 1934\u201335 following relegation in 1933.

After the end of the First World War, a chalk quarry known as the Swamps was identified as Charlton's new ground, and in the summer of 1919 work began to create the level playing area and remove debris from the site. The first match at this site, now known as the club's current ground The Valley, was in September 1919. Charlton stayed at The Valley until 1923, when the club moved to The Mount stadium in Catford as part of a proposed merger with Catford Southend.

Opened as the Gallo Opera House in 1927, it served as a CBS broadcast studio in the mid-20th century. The venue became a scene in 1977 when Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager opened Studio 54, a nightclub retaining much of the former theatrical and broadcasting fixtures. Roundabout Theatre Company renovated the space into a Broadway house in 1998.\nThe producer Fortune Gallo announced plans for an opera house in 1926, hiring Eugene De Rosa as the architect. The Gallo Opera House opened November 8, 1927, but soon went bankrupt and was renamed the New Yorker Theatre. The space also operated as the Casino de Paree nightclub, then the Palladium Music Hall, before the Federal Music Project staged productions at the theater for three years starting in 1937. CBS began using the venue as a soundstage in 1942, then as a television studio until 1975.\nSchrager and Rubell opened the Studio 54 nightclub on April 26, 1977, as disco was gaining popularity in the U.S. Infamous for its celebrity guest lists, quixotic entry policies, extravagant events, rampant drug use, and sexual hedonism, Studio 54 closed in 1980 after Schrager and Rubell were convicted of tax evasion. A scaled-back version of the nightclub continued under new management before becoming the Ritz rock club in 1989, then the Cabaret Royale bar in 1994.\nThe Roundabout Theatre Company renovated the space in 1998 to relocate its production of the musical Cabaret, which ran at Studio 54 until 2004. The modern theater has since hosted multiple productions each season. The main auditorium, with 1,006 seats on two levels, is complemented by two sister cabaret venues: Upstairs at 54 on the second floor since 2001, and 54 Below in the basement since 2012.

De Rosa's original plans called for lounges, restrooms, and promenades on three stories, as well as an opera museum below the primary floors. By 1933, when it was being used as the Casino de Paree nightclub, the theater had 650 seats on the orchestra level and 500 seats in the balcony. CBS documents show that, when the theater was used as CBS Studio 52 in the mid-20th century, it had 828 seats on three levels: 312 in the orchestra, 371 in the balcony, and 145 in a mezzanine. The modern-day theater has 1,006 seats across two levels: 519 in the orchestra and 487 in the balcony. The theater contained nightclub tables during the late 20th century, which were removed in 1998 after Studio 54's re-conversion into a theater and replaced with raked seating.Ida Louise Killam designed the original interior with a gold, blue, and rose palette. One early observer described the theater as having \"a Roxy foyer and a Paramount promenade\". The orchestra seats were originally divided by five aisles. The orchestra-level walls were clad with walnut, and the trimmings at balcony level and in the mezzanine lounge were also made of walnut.

The ground was donated to the club by Frank Adams, a former Wanderers player who had bought the freehold on the ground from Lord Carrington in 1945.\nThe club's present ground, Adams Park, was named in honour of Frank Adams.\nThe most famous feature of the ground was the 11-foot slope across the pitch, running downhill from the main seated stand.\nThe record attendance was 15,850 for an FA Amateur Cup Fourth Round tie on Saturday 25 February 1950, when Wycombe Wanderers beat St Albans City 4\u20131. It remains to this day the highest attendance for a Wycombe Wanderers home fixture. The ground comprised a wooden seated main stand (holding around 1,000 people) along the top (south) side of the ground, a covered stand opposite this with shallow terracing (affectionately known as the \"Cowshed\"), and open terraces with crowd barriers at each end.\nArguably the most memorable match to be played at Loakes Park was in the FA Cup Third Round on Saturday 4 January 1975. At the time, Middlesbrough were near the top of the old Football League First Division (now the Premier League), and Wycombe (a non-league team at this time) held them to a 0\u20130 draw.

In Laurel, MD 198 originally followed Montgomery Street and the piece of Sandy Spring Road north of modern MD 198 from Montgomery Street to the I-95 interchange. A separate segment of MD 198 was built as a macadam road from MD 27 (later US 29, now MD 650) to a point east of Good Hope Road in 1929 and 1930. In addition, the first segment of the state highway was extended as a 20-foot-wide (6.1 m) macadam road from the county line to the western Old Columbia Pike intersection in Burtonsville; the macadam road continued south along Old Columbia Pike, which was then designated MD 196. MD 198 was widened with a pair of 3.5-foot-wide (1.1 m) bituminous shoulders from the county line east to Laurel between 1938 and 1940. There remained a gap in MD 198 between Spencerville and Burtonsville until the intervening county road was brought into state maintenance in 1956.\nThe original route connecting Laurel and Fort Meade was MD 216. That highway was built between 1934 and 1939 along a course generally north of modern MD 198. Modern MD 198 was constructed as MD 602 as a military access project during World War II. The first segment of the new highway, from US 1 to MD 216 near Brock Bridge Road in what is now Maryland City, was started in 1943 and completed in 1944. This segment included a bridge across the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (now CSX) in Laurel and a bridge across the Patuxent River. The remainder of MD 602, from near Brock Bridge Road to the entrance to Fort Meade near the Little Patuxent River, was completed by 1946. When MD 602 was completed, MD 216 was truncated at US 1.MD 198 was widened to 30 feet (9.1 m) on Montgomery Street in Laurel in 1948. When the US 1 Laurel Bypass\u2014today the northbound lanes of the U.S. Highway on Second Street\u2014was completed, the highway was extended east one block on Montgomery Street to the new bypass in 1950 and 1951. In 1963, MD 198 was removed from Montgomery Avenue and placed on its Gorman\u2013Talbott one-way pair through Laurel in 1963. That same year, a new piece of highway was created from Van Dusen Road to Ninth Street to connect the one-way pair with Sandy Spring Road. That same year, MD 198 was extended over the course of MD 602 to Fort Meade. The first portion of MD 198 to become a divided highway was along a new alignment from Sweitzer Lane to Van Dusen Road. This highway was built concurrent with I-95 and the I-95\u2013MD 198 interchange in 1970 and 1971.\nThe MD 198 divided highway was extended west from Sweitzer Lane to what was then US 29 in 1985. That same year, the state highway was expanded to a divided highway from US 1 to the Patuxent River. MD 198 was rebuilt as a divided highway from the Patuxent River to just west of the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway in 1987. The divided highway was extended through the parkway interchange in 1991. As part of the construction, the original five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange had a loop ramp added from the northbound parkway to westbound MD 198. That same year, MD 198 was extended east from the Little Patuxent River to newly constructed MD 32 in Fort Meade. The state highway's western terminus was relocated from an acute intersection with MD 650 to an orthogonal intersection in 1997. The west leg of the intersection became operational when the extended Norbeck Road, a county highway connecting the ends of MD 28 and MD 198, opened in 2004. MD 198's eastern end was extended along its current course when the MD 198\u2013MD 32 dumbbell interchange was completed in 2002.

The proposals also include adding a center left-turn lane to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike intersection and constructing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has also conducted a study concerning MD 198 between the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed improvements are associated with the Base Realignment and Closure process that has greatly increased activity at Fort Meade. The preferred alternative that came out of the study was to expand MD 198 from the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-lane divided highway and to construct a flyover ramp from westbound MD 32 to westbound MD 198 to supplement the existing dumbbell interchange.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_43665", "text": "MD 198 begins at a four-legged intersection with MD 650 (New Hampshire Avenue) west of Spencerville.

MD 198 drops to four lanes at its partial cloverleaf interchange with the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway (unsigned MD 295) and then becomes a two-lane undivided road a short distance east of the interchange. The state highway crosses the Little Patuxent River, then curves southeast and expands to a four-lane divided highway as it parallels MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). At the entrance to Tipton Airport, MD 198 curves north and meets MD 32 at a dumbbell interchange. The highway passes through an S-curve then reaches its eastern terminus at an entrance to Fort Meade. The road continues into the military installation as Mapes Road.MD 198 is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length. The highway is an intermodal connector between I-95 and US 1. The remainder of the highway is a National Highway System principal arterial.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_43666", "text": "The first segment of MD 198 was built as a 15-foot-wide (4.6 m) concrete road from US 1 west to Contee Road by 1921; the two roads intersected at the site of the modern I-95 interchange. The concrete road was extended west to the Montgomery\u2013Prince George's county line in 1923. In Laurel, MD 198 originally followed Montgomery Street and the piece of Sandy Spring Road north of modern MD 198 from Montgomery Street to the I-95 interchange. A separate segment of MD 198 was built as a macadam road from MD 27 (later US 29, now MD 650) to a point east of Good Hope Road in 1929 and 1930. In addition, the first segment of the state highway was extended as a 20-foot-wide (6.1 m) macadam road from the county line to the western Old Columbia Pike intersection in Burtonsville; the macadam road continued south along Old Columbia Pike, which was then designated MD 196. MD 198 was widened with a pair of 3.5-foot-wide (1.1 m) bituminous shoulders from the county line east to Laurel between 1938 and 1940. There remained a gap in MD 198 between Spencerville and Burtonsville until the intervening county road was brought into state maintenance in 1956.\nThe original route connecting Laurel and Fort Meade was MD 216. That highway was built between 1934 and 1939 along a course generally north of modern MD 198. Modern MD 198 was constructed as MD 602 as a military access project during World War II. The first segment of the new highway, from US 1 to MD 216 near Brock Bridge Road in what is now Maryland City, was started in 1943 and completed in 1944. This segment included a bridge across the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (now CSX) in Laurel and a bridge across the Patuxent River. The remainder of MD 602, from near Brock Bridge Road to the entrance to Fort Meade near the Little Patuxent River, was completed by 1946. When MD 602 was completed, MD 216 was truncated at US 1.MD 198 was widened to 30 feet (9.1 m) on Montgomery Street in Laurel in 1948. When the US 1 Laurel Bypass\u2014today the northbound lanes of the U.S. Highway on Second Street\u2014was completed, the highway was extended east one block on Montgomery Street to the new bypass in 1950 and 1951. In 1963, MD 198 was removed from Montgomery Avenue and placed on its Gorman\u2013Talbott one-way pair through Laurel in 1963. That same year, a new piece of highway was created from Van Dusen Road to Ninth Street to connect the one-way pair with Sandy Spring Road. That same year, MD 198 was extended over the course of MD 602 to Fort Meade. The first portion of MD 198 to become a divided highway was along a new alignment from Sweitzer Lane to Van Dusen Road. This highway was built concurrent with I-95 and the I-95\u2013MD 198 interchange in 1970 and 1971.\nThe MD 198 divided highway was extended west from Sweitzer Lane to what was then US 29 in 1985. That same year, the state highway was expanded to a divided highway from US 1 to the Patuxent River. MD 198 was rebuilt as a divided highway from the Patuxent River to just west of the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway in 1987. The divided highway was extended through the parkway interchange in 1991. As part of the construction, the original five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange had a loop ramp added from the northbound parkway to westbound MD 198. That same year, MD 198 was extended east from the Little Patuxent River to newly constructed MD 32 in Fort Meade. The state highway's western terminus was relocated from an acute intersection with MD 650 to an orthogonal intersection in 1997. The west leg of the intersection became operational when the extended Norbeck Road, a county highway connecting the ends of MD 28 and MD 198, opened in 2004. MD 198's eastern end was extended along its current course when the MD 198\u2013MD 32 dumbbell interchange was completed in 2002. The MD 198\u2013US 29 interchange opened in 2005.MDSHA has conducted a study on the east\u2013west corridor between the MD 28\u2013MD 97 intersection at Norbeck and the I-95\u2013MD 198 interchange, a corridor that forms the most direct route from Laurel to Rockville. Plans for the MD 198 portion of the corridor call for expanding the route to a four-lane divided highway from MD 650 to US 29 and widening the highway to six lanes from the Montgomery\u2013Prince George's County line to west of I-95. The proposals also include adding a center left-turn lane to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike intersection and constructing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has also conducted a study concerning MD 198 between the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed improvements are associated with the Base Realignment and Closure process that has greatly increased activity at Fort Meade. The preferred alternative that came out of the study was to expand MD 198 from the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-lane divided highway and to construct a flyover ramp from westbound MD 32 to westbound MD 198 to supplement the existing dumbbell interchange.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the US state of Michigan, it was a north\u2013south state trunkline highway that entered the state south of Kinderhook and ended south of Grayling. Its route consisted of a freeway concurrency with Interstate 69 (I-69) from the state line north to the Lansing area before it followed its own freeway facility northward to St. Johns. From there north to Ithaca, US 27 was an expressway before continuing as a freeway to a terminus south of Grayling.\nCreated with the rest of the US Highway System on November 11, 1926, US 27 replaced a pair of state highways between the state line and the Cheboygan area. For a time, US 27 even extended from Cheboygan to St. Ignace over the Mackinac Bridge. The highway was converted into a series of freeways starting in the late 1950s. The northernmost section between Grayling and Mackinaw City, bypassing Cheboygan, became part of I-75, and US 27 was truncated to Grayling. Starting in the 1960s, the southern sections were included in I-69. The last section of Interstate in Michigan was completed in 1992 when I-69/US 27 opened southwest of Lansing. In the 1990s, a bypass of St. Johns north of Lansing was built, the last freeway segment of US 27 to open under that designation. On April 16, 1999, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the removal of the US 27 designation from the state of Michigan; this change was put into place when the highway number was removed from signage in 2002.

Comprising private, race-specific sections of track in addition to public roads which remain accessible most of the year, its present configuration is 13.626 km (8.467 mi) long, making it one of the longest circuits in the world. The capacity of the race stadium, where the short Bugatti Circuit is situated, is 100,000. The Mus\u00e9e des 24 Heures du Mans is a motorsport museum located at the main entrance of the venue.\nUp to 85% of the lap time is spent on full throttle, putting immense stress on engine and drivetrain components. Additionally, the times spent reaching maximum speed also mean tremendous wear on the brakes and suspension as cars must slow from over 322 km/h (200 mph) to around 100 km/h (62 mph) for the sharp corner at the village of Mulsanne.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_43701", "text": "The road racing track, which was a triangle from Le Mans down south to Mulsanne, northwest to Arnage, and back north to Le Mans, has undergone many modifications over the years, with CIRCUIT N\u00b015 being in use since 2018. Even with the modifications put in place over the years, the Sarthe circuit is still known for being very fast, with prototype cars achieving average lap speeds in excess of 240 km/h (150 mph).\nIn the 1920s, the cars drove from the present pits on Rue de Laign\u00e9 straight into the city, and after a sharp right-hand corner near the river Huisne Pontlieue bridge (a hairpin permanently removed from the circuit in 1929), before exiting the city again on the rather straight section now named Avenue Georges Durand after the race's founder. Then 17.261 km (10.725 mi) long and unpaved, a bypass within the city shortened the track in 1929, but the city was only bypassed completely in 1932, when the section from the pits via the Dunlop Bridge and the Esses to Tertre Rouge was added. This classic configuration was 13.492 km (8.384 mi) long and remained almost unaltered even after the 1955 tragedy. Its frighteningly narrow pit straight was further narrowed to make room for the pits and was part of the road itself, without the road becoming wider around the pits, and no separation. The pit straight then was about 3.7 m (12 ft) wide, further widened in 1956 after the tragedy, but the race track and pits were not separated for another 15 years.\n\nCar speeds increased dramatically in the 1960s, pushing the limits of  the \"classic circuit\" and sparking criticism of the track as being unsafe after several trials related fatalities occurred. In 1965, a smaller, but permanent, Bugatti Circuit was added which shares the pit lane facilities and the first corner (including the famous Dunlop bridge) with the full \"Le Mans\" circuit. For the 1968 race, the Ford chicane was added before the pits to slow down the cars. The circuit was fitted with Armco for the 1969 race. The \"Maison Blanche\" kink was particularly harrowing, claiming many cars over the years (including three Ferrari 512 variants) and several lives, including the legendary John Woolfe in 1969 behind the wheel of a 917 Porsche. The circuit has been modified ten more times \u2014 1971, a year when prototypes were averaging over 240 km/h (150 mph), was the last year the classic circuit was used. That year, Armco was added to the pit straight to separate the track from the pits. In 1972, the race track was considerably revamped, at a cost of 300 million francs, with modification of the pit area and the first and final straights, the addition of the quick Porsche curves bypassing \"Maison Blanche\", the signalling area was moved to the exit of the slow Mulsanne corner, and the track was resurfaced.\n\nIn 1979, due to the construction of a new public road, the profile of \"Tertre Rouge\" had to be changed. This redesign led to a faster double-apex corner and saw the removal of the second Dunlop Bridge. In 1986, construction of a new roundabout at the Mulsanne corner demanded the addition a new portion of track in order to avoid the roundabout. This created a right hand kink prior to Mulsanne corner. In 1987, a chicane was added to the very fast Dunlop curve, where cars would go under the Dunlop bridge at 180 mph (290 km/h). Now they would be slowed to 110 mph (180 km/h).\n\nLe Mans was most famous for its 6 km (3.7 mi) long straight, called Ligne Droite des Hunaudi\u00e8res, a part of the route d\u00e9partementale (for the Sarthe d\u00e9partement) D338 (formerly Route Nationale N138). As the Hunaudi\u00e8res leads to the village of Mulsanne, it is often called the Mulsanne Straight in English, even though the proper Route du Mulsanne is the one from or to Arnage.\nAfter exiting the Tertre Rouge corner, cars spent almost half of the lap at full throttle, before braking for Mulsanne Corner. The Porsche 917 long tail, used from 1969 to 1971, had reached 362 km/h (225 mph). After engine size was limited, the top speed dropped until powerful turbo engines were allowed, like in the 1978 Porsche 935, which was clocked at 367 km/h (228 mph). Speeds on the straight by the Group C prototypes reached over 400 km/h (250 mph) during the late 1980s. At the beginning of the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans race, Roger Dorchy driving for Welter Racing in a \"Project 400\" car, which sacrificed reliability for speed, was clocked by radar travelling at 407 km/h (253 mph). Jean-Louis Lafosse and Jo Gartner would ultimately suffer from fatal high speed accidents in 1981 and 1986, respectively, leading to concerns with the growing speeds on the 3.7 mi (6.0 km) straight.\nAs the combination of high speed and high downforce caused tyre and engine failures, two roughly equally spaced chicanes were consequently added to the Mulsanne Straight before the 1990 race to limit the maximum achievable speed. The chicanes were also added because the FIA decreed it would no longer sanction a circuit which had a straight longer than 2 km (1.2 mi),  which is roughly the length of the D\u00f6ttinger H\u00f6he straight at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife. The fastest qualifying lap average speed though only dropped from 249.826 to 243.329 km/h (155.235 to 151.198 mph) in 1992. In 1994, the Dunlop chicane was tightened.\nIn 2002, the run to the Esses was reconfigured in the wake of renovations to the Bugatti Circuit. The Le Mans circuit was changed between the Dunlop Bridge and Esses, with the straight now becoming a set of fast sweeping turns. This layout allowed for a better transition from the Le Mans circuit to the Bugatti circuit. This layout change would also require the track's infamous carnival to be relocated near the Porsche curves, and in 2006, the ACO redeveloped the area between the Dunlop Curve and Tertre Rouge, moving the Dunlop Chicane in even tighter to create more run-off area, while also turning the area after the Dunlop Chicane into an even larger set of fast, sweeping turns, known as the Esses en route to Tertre Rouge. As part of the development, a new extended pit lane exit was created for the Bugatti Circuit. This second pit exit re-enters the track just beyond the Dunlop Chicane and before the Dunlop Bridge.\nFollowing the fatal crash of Danish driver Allan Simonsen at the 2013 race at the exit of Tertre Rouge into D338, Tertre Rouge was re-profiled again.

Even with the modifications put in place over the years, the Sarthe circuit is still known for being very fast, with prototype cars achieving average lap speeds in excess of 240 km/h (150 mph).\nIn the 1920s, the cars drove from the present pits on Rue de Laign\u00e9 straight into the city, and after a sharp right-hand corner near the river Huisne Pontlieue bridge (a hairpin permanently removed from the circuit in 1929), before exiting the city again on the rather straight section now named Avenue Georges Durand after the race's founder. Then 17.261 km (10.725 mi) long and unpaved, a bypass within the city shortened the track in 1929, but the city was only bypassed completely in 1932, when the section from the pits via the Dunlop Bridge and the Esses to Tertre Rouge was added. This classic configuration was 13.492 km (8.384 mi) long and remained almost unaltered even after the 1955 tragedy. Its frighteningly narrow pit straight was further narrowed to make room for the pits and was part of the road itself, without the road becoming wider around the pits, and no separation. The pit straight then was about 3.7 m (12 ft) wide, further widened in 1956 after the tragedy, but the race track and pits were not separated for another 15 years.\n\nCar speeds increased dramatically in the 1960s, pushing the limits of  the \"classic circuit\" and sparking criticism of the track as being unsafe after several trials related fatalities occurred. In 1965, a smaller, but permanent, Bugatti Circuit was added which shares the pit lane facilities and the first corner (including the famous Dunlop bridge) with the full \"Le Mans\" circuit. For the 1968 race, the Ford chicane was added before the pits to slow down the cars. The circuit was fitted with Armco for the 1969 race. The \"Maison Blanche\" kink was particularly harrowing, claiming many cars over the years (including three Ferrari 512 variants) and several lives, including the legendary John Woolfe in 1969 behind the wheel of a 917 Porsche. The circuit has been modified ten more times \u2014 1971, a year when prototypes were averaging over 240 km/h (150 mph), was the last year the classic circuit was used. That year, Armco was added to the pit straight to separate the track from the pits. In 1972, the race track was considerably revamped, at a cost of 300 million francs, with modification of the pit area and the first and final straights, the addition of the quick Porsche curves bypassing \"Maison Blanche\", the signalling area was moved to the exit of the slow Mulsanne corner, and the track was resurfaced.\n\nIn 1979, due to the construction of a new public road, the profile of \"Tertre Rouge\" had to be changed. This redesign led to a faster double-apex corner and saw the removal of the second Dunlop Bridge. In 1986, construction of a new roundabout at the Mulsanne corner demanded the addition a new portion of track in order to avoid the roundabout. This created a right hand kink prior to Mulsanne corner. In 1987, a chicane was added to the very fast Dunlop curve, where cars would go under the Dunlop bridge at 180 mph (290 km/h). Now they would be slowed to 110 mph (180 km/h).\n\nLe Mans was most famous for its 6 km (3.7 mi) long straight, called Ligne Droite des Hunaudi\u00e8res, a part of the route d\u00e9partementale (for the Sarthe d\u00e9partement) D338 (formerly Route Nationale N138). As the Hunaudi\u00e8res leads to the village of Mulsanne, it is often called the Mulsanne Straight in English, even though the proper Route du Mulsanne is the one from or to Arnage.\nAfter exiting the Tertre Rouge corner, cars spent almost half of the lap at full throttle, before braking for Mulsanne Corner. The Porsche 917 long tail, used from 1969 to 1971, had reached 362 km/h (225 mph). After engine size was limited, the top speed dropped until powerful turbo engines were allowed, like in the 1978 Porsche 935, which was clocked at 367 km/h (228 mph). Speeds on the straight by the Group C prototypes reached over 400 km/h (250 mph) during the late 1980s.

The Thursday to Sunday run called in at Ocean Falls.In 1979, the North Island Highway was completed through to Port Hardy, and a new terminal built at nearby Bear Cove. In 1980, Queen of the North entered service on the Inside Passage route. The British Columbia government decided to utilize Queen of Prince Rupert on the tourist run from Victoria to Seattle, replacing the coastal steamship Princess Marguerite. In what was seen by many as a politically expedient move, they leased Queen of Prince Rupert to the BC Steamship Corporation when Princess Marguerite was found to violate US pollution requirements. The vessel was renamed Victoria Princess. To enable loading at Victoria's Inner Harbour, a side-loading door was installed. Victoria Princess only operated on the route for one summer, however, and in November, 1980, returned to the BC Ferries fleet as Queen of Prince Rupert to begin its service between Prince Rupert and Skidegate.\nWhen Queen of the North sank on March 22, 2006, Queen of Prince Rupert was in drydock undergoing its annual refit. She was quickly pressed back into service, and made her first voyage of the season less than a month later. On April 20, 2006, the vessel made her first crossing through Wright Sound where her sister ship had sunk. Queen of Prince Rupert stopped at the spot and passengers threw into the water 99 white roses (the number of people rescued) and two red roses (for the two people missing and presumed dead). Queen of Prince Rupert continued covering both the Inside Passage and Queen Charlotte Islands routes until the replacement Northern Adventure was ready for service in March 2007. This necessitated considerably reduced service in the busy summer tourism season, and had a significant effect on the economies of coastal communities.\nPrevious to the Queen of the North disaster, crew quarters on both vessels were below the waterline, beneath the car deck. Passenger state rooms below the waterline had not been used for a number of years, but the crew's bunks and mess continued in use. Immediately after the sinking, however, the passenger cabins on Queen of Prince Rupert's Promenade deck were given over to the crew, greatly reducing the number of state rooms available to travellers, but ensuring the safety of the crew.\nQueen of Prince Rupert was decommissioned at a ceremony in Prince Rupert on April 20, 2009. The new Northern Expedition as well as the newly purchased Northern Adventure (which is Queen of Prince Rupert's replacement on the Prince Rupert\u2013Skidegate route) were present along with Queen of Prince Rupert in Prince Rupert Harbour on April 19, 2009, marking the only time to date that all three vessels were in the same location together.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The state trunkline highway is also known as the Walter P. Reuther Freeway, named for the prominent auto industry union head by the Michigan Legislature in 1971. I-696 is a bypass route, detouring around the city of Detroit through the city's northern suburbs in Oakland and Macomb counties. It starts by branching off I-96 and I-275 at its western terminus in Farmington Hills, and runs through suburbs including Southfield, Royal Oak and Warren before merging into I-94 at St. Clair Shores on the east end. It has eight lanes for most of its length and is approximately 10 miles (16 km) north of downtown Detroit. I-696 connects to other freeways such as I-75 (Chrysler Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway). Local residents sometimes refer to I-696 as \"The Autobahn of Detroit\".\nPlanning for the freeway started in the 1950s. Michigan state officials proposed the designation I-98, but this was not approved. Construction started on the first segment in 1961, and the Lodge Freeway was designated Business Spur Interstate 696 (BS I-696) the following year. The western third of the freeway opened in 1963, and the eastern third was completed in January 1979. The central segment was the subject of much controversy during the 1960s and 1970s. Various municipalities along this stretch argued over the routing of the freeway such that the governor locked several officials into a room overnight until they would agree to a routing. Later, various groups used federal environmental regulations to force changes to the freeway. The Orthodox Jewish community in Oak Park was concerned about pedestrian access across the freeway; I-696 was built with a set of parks on overpasses to accommodate their needs. The Detroit Zoo and the City of Detroit also fought components of the freeway design. These concessions delayed the completion of I-696 until December 15, 1989. Since completion, the speed limit was raised from 55 to 70 miles per hour (89 to 113 km/h).

{"id": "127_354", "question": "Who owns RMS Titanic?", "ctxs": [{"id": "127_43745", "text": "RMS Titanic was a British passenger and mail carrying ocean liner, operated by the White Star Line, that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 as a result of striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, United States. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, about 1,500 died, making it the deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time. The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired many artistic works.\nRMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners built for the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipbuilding company in Belfast. Thomas Andrews Jr., the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. Titanic was under the command of Captain Edward John Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.\nThe first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, smoking rooms, high-class restaurants and cafes, a Victorian-style Turkish bath, and hundreds of opulent cabins. A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger \"marconigrams\" and for the ship's operational use. Titanic had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, contributing to her reputation as \"unsinkable\".\nTitanic was equipped with 16 lifeboat davits, each capable of lowering three lifeboats, for a total of 48 boats. Despite this capacity of 48, the ship was only equipped with a total of 20 lifeboats. Fourteen were regular lifeboats, two were cutter lifeboats, and four were collapsible and proved difficult to launch while she was sinking. Together, the 20 lifeboats could hold 1,178 people\u2014about half the number of passengers on board, and one-third of the number of passengers the ship could have carried at full capacity (a number consistent with the maritime safety regulations of the era). The British Board of Trade's regulations required 14 lifeboats for a ship 10,000 tonnes. Titanic carried six more than required, allowing 338 extra people room in lifeboats. When the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_43746", "text": "The name Titanic derives from the Titans of Greek mythology. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, RMS Titanic was the second of the three Olympic-class ocean liners\u2014the lead vessel was RMS Olympic and the final ship in the class was HMHS Britannic.  They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line's fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912. The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, and the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM).\nWhite Star faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals, Cunard Line\u2014which, with the aid of the Royal Navy, had recently launched the twin sister ships Lusitania and Mauretania, the fastest passenger ships then in service\u2014and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before, as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury. White Star sought an upgrade of its fleet primarily to respond to the introduction of the Cunard giants but also to considerably strengthen its position on the Southampton\u2013Cherbourg\u2013New York service that had been inaugurated in 1907. The new ships would have sufficient speed to maintain a weekly service with only three ships instead of the original four. Thus, Olympic and Titanic would replace RMS Teutonic of 1889, RMS Majestic of 1890 as well as RMS Adriatic of 1907. RMS Oceanic made her first departure from her new homeport in June 1907. Her running mates on the Southampton-New York run were the Teutonic, Majestic, and the new Adriatic. Majestic resumed her old position on the White Star Line's New York service after the loss of Titanic.The ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilder Harland & Wolff, which had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867. Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for Wilhelm Wolff to sketch a general concept, which Edward James Harland would turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were a relatively low priority; Harland & Wolff were authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin. In the case of the Olympic-class ships, a cost of \u00a33 million (approximately \u00a3310 million in 2019) for the first two ships was agreed plus \"extras to contract\" and the usual five per cent fee.Harland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing Olympic-class vessels. The design was overseen by Lord Pirrie, a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews's deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager. Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment, and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design.On July 29, 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three \"letters of agreement\" two days later, authorising the start of construction.  At this point, the first ship\u2014which was later to become Olympic\u2014had no name but was referred to simply as \"Number 400\", as it was Harland and Wolff's four-hundredth hull. Titanic was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_43747", "text": "Titanic was 882 feet 9 inches (269.06 m) long with a maximum breadth of 92 feet 6 inches (28.19 m).\nHer total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was 104 feet (32 m). She measured 46,329 GRT and 21,831 NRT and with a draught of 34 feet 7 inches (10.54 m), she displaced 52,310 tons.\nAll three of the Olympic-class ships had ten decks (excluding the top of the officers' quarters), eight of which were for passenger use. From top to bottom, the decks were:\n\nThe boat deck, on which the lifeboats were housed. It was from here during the early hours of 15 April 1912 that Titanic's lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic. The bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward end, in front of the captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge stood 8 feet (2.4 m) above the deck, extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking. The wheelhouse stood within the bridge. The entrance to the First Class Grand Staircase and gymnasium were located midships along with the raised roof of the First Class lounge, while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the First Class smoke room and the relatively modest Second Class entrance. Just forward of the Second Class entrance sat the kennels, where the First Class passengers' dogs would stay. The wood-covered deck was divided into four segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers, and Second Class passengers respectively. Lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the First Class area, where there was a gap so that the view would not be spoiled.\nA Deck, also called the promenade deck, extended along the entire 546 feet (166 m) length of the superstructure. It was reserved exclusively for First Class passengers and contained First Class cabins, the First Class reading and writing room, lounge, smoke room, and Palm Court.\nB Deck, the bridge deck, was the top weight-bearing deck and the uppermost level of the hull. More First Class passenger accommodations were located here with six palatial staterooms (cabins) featuring their own private promenades. On Titanic, the \u00e0 la carte restaurant and the Caf\u00e9 Parisien provided luxury dining facilities to First Class passengers. Both were run by subcontracted chefs and their staff; all were lost in the disaster. The Second Class smoking room and entrance hall were both located on this deck. The raised forecastle of the ship was forward of the bridge deck, accommodating Number 1 hatch (the main hatch through to the cargo holds), numerous pieces of machinery and the anchor housings. Aft of the bridge deck was the raised poop deck, 106 feet (32 m) long, used as a promenade by Third Class passengers. It was where many of Titanic's passengers and crew made their last stand as the ship sank. The forecastle and poop deck were separated from the bridge deck by well decks.\nC Deck, the shelter deck, was the highest deck to run uninterrupted from stem to stern. It included both well decks; the aft one served as part of the Third-Class promenade. Crew cabins were housed below the forecastle and Third-Class public rooms were housed below the poop deck. In between were the majority of First Class cabins and the Second-Class library. \nD Deck, the saloon deck, was dominated by three large public rooms\u2014the First-Class reception room, the First-Class dining saloon and the Second-Class dining saloon. The first- and second-class galleys were also located on this deck. An open space was provided for Third Class passengers. First, Second- and Third-Class passengers had cabins on this deck, with berths for firemen located in the bow. It was the highest level reached by the ship's watertight bulkheads (though only by eight of the fifteen bulkheads).\nE Deck, the upper deck, was predominantly used for passenger accommodation for all three classes plus berths for cooks, seamen, stewards and trimmers. Along its length ran a long passageway nicknamed 'Scotland Road', in reference to a famous street in Liverpool. Scotland Road was used by Third Class passengers and crew members.\nF Deck, the middle deck, was the last complete deck, and mainly accommodated Second- and Third-Class passengers and several departments of the crew. The Third Class dining saloon was located here, as was the First Class bath complex, containing the swimming pool and the Turkish bath.\nG Deck, the lower deck, was the lowest complete deck that carried passengers, and had the lowest portholes, just above the waterline. The first-class squash court was located here along with the travelling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by orlop (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.\nThe orlop decks, and the tank top below that, were on the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline. The orlop decks were used as cargo spaces, while the tank top\u2014the inner bottom of the ship's hull\u2014provided the platform on which the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing.

Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before, as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury. White Star sought an upgrade of its fleet primarily to respond to the introduction of the Cunard giants but also to considerably strengthen its position on the Southampton\u2013Cherbourg\u2013New York service that had been inaugurated in 1907. The new ships would have sufficient speed to maintain a weekly service with only three ships instead of the original four. Thus, Olympic and Titanic would replace RMS Teutonic of 1889, RMS Majestic of 1890 as well as RMS Adriatic of 1907. RMS Oceanic made her first departure from her new homeport in June 1907. Her running mates on the Southampton-New York run were the Teutonic, Majestic, and the new Adriatic. Majestic resumed her old position on the White Star Line's New York service after the loss of Titanic.The ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilder Harland & Wolff, which had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867. Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for Wilhelm Wolff to sketch a general concept, which Edward James Harland would turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were a relatively low priority; Harland & Wolff were authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin. In the case of the Olympic-class ships, a cost of \u00a33 million (approximately \u00a3310 million in 2019) for the first two ships was agreed plus \"extras to contract\" and the usual five per cent fee.Harland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing Olympic-class vessels. The design was overseen by Lord Pirrie, a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews's deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager. Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment, and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design.On July 29, 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three \"letters of agreement\" two days later, authorising the start of construction.  At this point, the first ship\u2014which was later to become Olympic\u2014had no name but was referred to simply as \"Number 400\", as it was Harland and Wolff's four-hundredth hull. Titanic was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_43747", "text": "Titanic was 882 feet 9 inches (269.06 m) long with a maximum breadth of 92 feet 6 inches (28.19 m).\nHer total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was 104 feet (32 m). She measured 46,329 GRT and 21,831 NRT and with a draught of 34 feet 7 inches (10.54 m), she displaced 52,310 tons.\nAll three of the Olympic-class ships had ten decks (excluding the top of the officers' quarters), eight of which were for passenger use. From top to bottom, the decks were:\n\nThe boat deck, on which the lifeboats were housed. It was from here during the early hours of 15 April 1912 that Titanic's lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic. The bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward end, in front of the captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge stood 8 feet (2.4 m) above the deck, extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking. The wheelhouse stood within the bridge. The entrance to the First Class Grand Staircase and gymnasium were located midships along with the raised roof of the First Class lounge, while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the First Class smoke room and the relatively modest Second Class entrance. Just forward of the Second Class entrance sat the kennels, where the First Class passengers' dogs would stay. The wood-covered deck was divided into four segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers, and Second Class passengers respectively. Lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the First Class area, where there was a gap so that the view would not be spoiled.\nA Deck, also called the promenade deck, extended along the entire 546 feet (166 m) length of the superstructure. It was reserved exclusively for First Class passengers and contained First Class cabins, the First Class reading and writing room, lounge, smoke room, and Palm Court.\nB Deck, the bridge deck, was the top weight-bearing deck and the uppermost level of the hull. More First Class passenger accommodations were located here with six palatial staterooms (cabins) featuring their own private promenades. On Titanic, the \u00e0 la carte restaurant and the Caf\u00e9 Parisien provided luxury dining facilities to First Class passengers. Both were run by subcontracted chefs and their staff; all were lost in the disaster. The Second Class smoking room and entrance hall were both located on this deck. The raised forecastle of the ship was forward of the bridge deck, accommodating Number 1 hatch (the main hatch through to the cargo holds), numerous pieces of machinery and the anchor housings. Aft of the bridge deck was the raised poop deck, 106 feet (32 m) long, used as a promenade by Third Class passengers. It was where many of Titanic's passengers and crew made their last stand as the ship sank. The forecastle and poop deck were separated from the bridge deck by well decks.\nC Deck, the shelter deck, was the highest deck to run uninterrupted from stem to stern. It included both well decks; the aft one served as part of the Third-Class promenade. Crew cabins were housed below the forecastle and Third-Class public rooms were housed below the poop deck. In between were the majority of First Class cabins and the Second-Class library. \nD Deck, the saloon deck, was dominated by three large public rooms\u2014the First-Class reception room, the First-Class dining saloon and the Second-Class dining saloon. The first- and second-class galleys were also located on this deck. An open space was provided for Third Class passengers. First, Second- and Third-Class passengers had cabins on this deck, with berths for firemen located in the bow. It was the highest level reached by the ship's watertight bulkheads (though only by eight of the fifteen bulkheads).\nE Deck, the upper deck, was predominantly used for passenger accommodation for all three classes plus berths for cooks, seamen, stewards and trimmers. Along its length ran a long passageway nicknamed 'Scotland Road', in reference to a famous street in Liverpool. Scotland Road was used by Third Class passengers and crew members.\nF Deck, the middle deck, was the last complete deck, and mainly accommodated Second- and Third-Class passengers and several departments of the crew. The Third Class dining saloon was located here, as was the First Class bath complex, containing the swimming pool and the Turkish bath.\nG Deck, the lower deck, was the lowest complete deck that carried passengers, and had the lowest portholes, just above the waterline. The first-class squash court was located here along with the travelling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by orlop (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.\nThe orlop decks, and the tank top below that, were on the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline. The orlop decks were used as cargo spaces, while the tank top\u2014the inner bottom of the ship's hull\u2014provided the platform on which the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing. They were connected with higher levels of the ship by two flights of stairs in the fireman's passage; twin spiral stairways near the bow provided access up to D Deck. Ladders in the boiler, turbine, and engine rooms provided access to higher decks in those compartments.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Booth Stradivarius has a two-piece back and has a body length of 35.4 cm.The Booth receives its name after a former owner, Madame Wilhelm von Booth who purchased the instrument in 1855 for her son Otto van Booth to be played in a Stradivari quartet. Otto van Booth sold the instrument in 1889 to George Hart, an instrument dealer in London, and the instrument has since been used in concerts. In 1930, Booth was sold at an auction by the American Art Association, New York to Rudolph Wurlitzer Company and played by the renowned Ukrainian-born violinist Mischa Mischakoff from 1931 to 1961. After 1961, the instrument became a part of the Henry Hottinger Collection in New York.

For this season's away kit, there was also a return to the first colours worn by the club (originally Leicester Fosse), albeit with black shorts as opposed to the original white. This kit returned once again for the 2023\u201324 season, having also featured during the 2004\u201305 season.In 1941, the club adopted the playing of the Post Horn Galop at home matches, to signal both teams entering the pitch. To the present day, the tune is usually played live on the pitch for the first half, while a modern version of the tune is played over the PA system for the second half. The club also plays a modern version of its anthem When You're Smiling before kick-off on home matchdays, with the connection to the song believed to have first originated in the late 1970's. Foxes Never Quit is the club's motto, with these words placed above the tunnel inside the stadium.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_43844", "text": "In their early years, Leicester played at numerous grounds, but have only played at two since they joined the Football League. When first starting out, they played on a field by Fosse Road, hence the original club name Leicester Fosse. They moved from there to Victoria Park, and subsequently to Belgrave Road. Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane. After eviction from Mill Lane the club played at the County Cricket ground while seeking a new ground. The club secured the use of an area of land by Filbert Street and moved there in 1891.Some improvements by noted football architect Archibald Leitch occurred in the Edwardian era, and in 1927 a new two-tier stand was built, nicknamed \"the Double Decker\", which would persist until the ground's closure in 2002. With the exception of the addition of compulsory seating, the ground saw no further development until 1993, when the Main Stand was demolished and replaced by the new Carling Stand. The addition of the new stand, while the rest of the ground had been untouched since the 1920s, led manager Martin O'Neill to joke that he used to \"lead new signings out backwards\" so they only saw the Carling Stand.\n\nThe club moved away from Filbert Street in 2002, to a new 32,500-capacity all-seater stadium located less than 300 yards away. The current site was known as the Walkers Stadium until 2011 in a deal with Leicester-based food manufacturers Walkers. The first match hosted at the stadium was a 1\u20131 friendly draw against Athletic Bilbao, with Bilbao's Tiko being the first scorer at the stadium and Jordan Stewart being the first Leicester player to score. The first competitive match was a 2\u20130 victory against Watford.On 19 August 2010, it emerged that the new owners King Power wanted to rename the stadium King Power Stadium, and had plans to increase the capacity to 42,000 should Leicester secure promotion. On 5 July 2011, Leicester City confirmed the Walkers Stadium would now be known as King Power Stadium. The stadium currently has an all-seated capacity of 32,262, with plans formally approved in December 2023 to extend this to 40,000. In 2020, the club moved into a new state-of-the-art training complex in the Leicestershire village of Seagrave, described as being \"one of the world's most advanced training facilities.\" The club's former training ground Belvoir Drive now serves as the training ground for Leicester City Women.", "hasanswer": false}]}

(Main highways in more populated areas would continue to be entirely under county control, though sometimes built with 50% state aid.) Six of these highways were east\u2013west crossings of the Cascades; others included a portion of Chuckanut Drive and a road around the west side of the Olympic Peninsula. Under a 1909 law, the State Highway Board surveyed a connected network of proposed state roads, The legislature added most of these routes to the state highway system in 1913, when they formed a two-tiered system of primary and secondary roads. Primary roads were completely controlled by the state, including maintenance, and received only names, while secondary roads kept their numbers and county maintenance. Unlike the earlier state roads, these primary roads mostly followed existing passable county roads.A 1923 restructuring of the system reassigned numbers to almost all the primary state highways, which were soon marked on signs. In 1937, the old primary/secondary split was abolished, and a new system of primary and secondary state highways was created, all to be maintained by the state in the same manner. The old state roads all kept their numbers as new primary state highways, and secondary state highways were created as alphanumeric branches of those primary highways (for instance SSH 8D was a branch of PSH 8). The final renumbering was authorized by law in 1963 and posted in January 1964, when new \"sign route\" numbers were assigned that matched the inter-state systems and otherwise formed the present grid. Until 1970, these numbers coexisted with the older primary and secondary state highways, when the legislature adopted the sign route numbers as \"state routes\", finally eliminating all vestiges of the 1905 numbering.The state legislature adopted new standards for designating state highways in 1990, following a three-year study from the Road Jurisdiction Committee.

According to the Washington State Department of Licensing, ocean beaches are legally state highways with a general speed limit of 25 mph (40 km/h), many only open to vehicles between the day after Labor Day and April 14, but state law places the beaches under the control of the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission and only designates them as \"public highways\".Most state routes are numbered in a grid, with even-numbered routes running east\u2013west and odd-numbered routes running north\u2013south. Even two-digit routes increase from south to north in three \"strips\", with SR 4, SR 6, and SR 8 in the western part of the state, SR 14, SR 16, SR 18, and SR 20 along the Interstate 5 corridor, and SR 22, SR 24, SR 26, SR 28, and former SR 30 in the east. Odd numbers similarly increase from west to east, with SR 3, Interstate 5, SR 7, SR 9, SR 11, SR 17, SR 21, SR 23, SR 25, SR 27, and SR 31 following this general progression. (SR 19 was added in 1991, and lies west of SR 3; SR 35 and SR 41 are extensions of highways in adjacent states.) Three-digit routes (and SR 92 and SR 96) are usually numbered by taking the first one or two digits of a route it connects to and adding another digit or two. In some cases, instead of using the two-digit route's actual number, a number that would fit the grid is used instead. Three-digit routes have been numbered as follows:", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_43871", "text": "After passing several early laws designating state roads starting in 1893, the Washington State Legislature created the State Highway Board in 1905 and appropriated funds to construct - but not maintain - twelve numbered \"state roads\" in sparsely settled areas of the state. (Main highways in more populated areas would continue to be entirely under county control, though sometimes built with 50% state aid.) Six of these highways were east\u2013west crossings of the Cascades; others included a portion of Chuckanut Drive and a road around the west side of the Olympic Peninsula. Under a 1909 law, the State Highway Board surveyed a connected network of proposed state roads, The legislature added most of these routes to the state highway system in 1913, when they formed a two-tiered system of primary and secondary roads. Primary roads were completely controlled by the state, including maintenance, and received only names, while secondary roads kept their numbers and county maintenance. Unlike the earlier state roads, these primary roads mostly followed existing passable county roads.A 1923 restructuring of the system reassigned numbers to almost all the primary state highways, which were soon marked on signs. In 1937, the old primary/secondary split was abolished, and a new system of primary and secondary state highways was created, all to be maintained by the state in the same manner. The old state roads all kept their numbers as new primary state highways, and secondary state highways were created as alphanumeric branches of those primary highways (for instance SSH 8D was a branch of PSH 8). The final renumbering was authorized by law in 1963 and posted in January 1964, when new \"sign route\" numbers were assigned that matched the inter-state systems and otherwise formed the present grid. Until 1970, these numbers coexisted with the older primary and secondary state highways, when the legislature adopted the sign route numbers as \"state routes\", finally eliminating all vestiges of the 1905 numbering.The state legislature adopted new standards for designating state highways in 1990, following a three-year study from the Road Jurisdiction Committee. Among the changes were recommending highways serving state parks and ferry terminals be added to the system. A major restructure was passed by the legislature in 1991 and took effect on April 1, 1992.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is the easternmost segment of Interstate 76 (I-76) in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It extends from the Valley Forge interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in King of Prussia, paralleling its namesake Schuylkill River for most of the route, southeast to the Walt Whitman Bridge over the Delaware River in South Philadelphia. It serves as the primary corridor into Philadelphia from points west. Maintenance and planning for most of the highway are administered through Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) District 6, with the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) maintaining the approach to the Walt Whitman Bridge.\nConstructed over a period of 10 years from 1949 to 1959, a large portion of the expressway predates the 1956 introduction of Interstate Highway System; many of these portions were not built to contemporary standards. The rugged terrain, limited riverfront space covered by the route and narrow spans of bridges passing over the highway have largely stymied later attempts to upgrade or widen the highway. With the road being highly over capacity, it has become notorious for its chronic congestion. An average of 163,000 vehicles use the road daily in Philadelphia County, and an average of 109,000 use the highway in Montgomery County, making it the busiest road in Pennsylvania. Its narrow lane and left shoulder configuration, left lane entrances and exits (nicknamed \"merge or die\"), common construction activity, and generally congested conditions have led to many accidents, critical injuries, and fatalities, leading to the highway's humorous nickname of the \"Surekill Expressway\" or, in further embellishment, the \"Surekill Distressway\" or the \"Surekill Crawlway\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_43878", "text": "Plans for a limited-access highway along the west bank of the Schuylkill River originated in 1932, as part of a proposed cars-only parkway system for the Philadelphia area similar to the contemporary system being built in New York City. The \"Valley Forge Parkway\" was to have run from Fairmount Park to Valley Forge State Park (now Valley Forge National Historical Park) with plans for a later extension to Reading via Pottstown. However, planning for the proposed parkway system stalled and the plan was eventually abandoned.Planning for today's expressway began in 1947, when the city of Philadelphia approved plans to develop a highway connecting Philadelphia with the terminus of the planned Philadelphia Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Valley Forge. The highway was designed by engineers Michael Rapuano, who had previously aided in the design of the Garden State Parkway, and Bill Allen of Gannett Fleming. The new expressway largely followed the earlier planned parkway route from Valley Forge to Fairmount Park, while also extending into southern Philadelphia and across the Delaware River into New Jersey. Two alternatives were proposed south of University City: one routing would continue along the west bank of the river into Southwest Philadelphia to its confluence near Philadelphia International Airport, where it would tunnel underneath the Delaware to Paulsboro, New Jersey; the other would cross the Schuylkill south of University City and bisect South Philadelphia, crossing the Delaware River into Gloucester City, New Jersey. Planned expansions of the airport in the path of the former proposal led to adoption of the routing through South Philadelphia.Construction of the road began in 1949. The road was completed in stages, with a short segment near King of Prussia opening in 1951 along with the turnpike's Philadelphia Extension, with the section from King of Prussia to Conshohocken opening a year later. The section between Conshohocken and City Avenue opened in 1954. The Walt Whitman Bridge opened in 1957. The expressway was completed through Fairmount Park in 1959, and, in 1960, the entire expressway was complete with the opening of the segment through University City.\nThe Schuylkill Expressway was initially designated as PA 43 and was cosigned with I-80S between King of Prussia and Center City and I-680 between Center City and the Walt Whitman Bridge when the Interstate Highway System was designated in 1956.  Prior to the roadways being signed as Interstates, I-395 was to be designated along the Schuylkill Expressway from the Vine Street Expressway to the Walt Whitman Bridge; however, I-680 was preferred to be the final designation for this route. On April 16, 1963, Pennsylvania wanted to renumber its Interstate numbers. Part of this was the renumbering from I-80S into I-76, and all of its auxiliary routes into I-x76. The Federal Highway Administration approved the request on February 26, 1964. As a result, I-80S became I-76 and I-680 became I-676. In addition to this renumbering, the PA 43 designation was removed from the Schuylkill Expressway. In 1972, the I-76 and the I-676 designations were switched onto their current routes, with the entire length of the Schuylkill Expressway designated as I-76. Immediately after its completion, operational studies performed on the Schuylkill Expressway found that the route would be unable to cope with the area's growing traffic demands, due to the many substandard design elements and compromises incorporated to cope with the rugged, difficult routing of the road. In 1962, plans were announced for a parallel expressway along the east bank of the Schuylkill River known as the Manayunk Expressway; however, these plans were quickly withdrawn due to substantial opposition. An alternative plan was then introduced to widen the entire highway to eight lanes in time for the US Bicentennial in 1976; however, these plans were also shelved due to local disapproval. A scaled-down widening project was successfully undertaken from 1969 to 1972 to widen a short section of the road to six lanes through Fairmount Park.\nIn the almost seven decades since its opening, congestion on the expressway has steadily increased. Plans to expand the expressway to eight lanes by building an upper deck, including high-occupancy toll lanes, were advocated by former Pennsylvania House Speaker John Perzel, but never came to fruition. PennDOT completed a scaled back version of a $23.7-million (equivalent to $32.9 million in 2023) project to add 29 webcams on the Schuylkill Expressway between the Conshohocken Curve and Passyunk Avenue.On the afternoon of June 8, 2011, a section of the Schuylkill Expressway near Grays Ferry Avenue buckled from temperatures around 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C), causing lane closures. The closed lane of the road was later reopened temporarily until full repairs could be made.Exactly three months later, on September 8, 2011, heavy rains caused by Tropical Storm Lee caused a rockslide in the vicinity of the Conshohocken Curve, flooding near Belmont Avenue, and a mudslide by Girard Avenue.

For this purpose it houses some outreach facilities like a planetarium and a 40-cm telescope, and owns an important collection of ancient astronomical instruments exhibited in the MuSA-Museum of Astronomical Instruments, and a rare and valuable old books preserved in the Ancient library.\nThe Astronomical Observatory of Naples was established by Joseph Bonaparte with a decree dated 29 January 1807 in the ancient monastery of San Gaudioso on the Caponapoli hill. The astronomer Giuseppe Cassella was the first director of the Neapolitan specola. When Joachim Murat was appointed king of Naples, he approved 8 March 1812 the foundation of a new Observatory on the Miradois hill, a site not far from the royal palace of Capodimonte. The astronomer Federigo Zuccari and the architect Stefano Gasse conceived a monumental building in the neoclassical style, the first to be designed in the capital of the Kingdom of Naples. On 4 November 1812 the foundation stone of the new observatory was laid with a solemn ceremony presided over by Interior Minister Giuseppe Zurlo. Defined by the astronomer Franz Xaver von Zach \"The Vesuvius of Astronomy erupting gold\", the new observatory was equipped with a most advanced collection of new telescopes, like the Fraunhofer equatorial telescope with an objective of 17.5 cm, the biggest one ever made until that time, and two repeating circle realised by the Reichenbach & Utzschneider Company in Munich.In 1812 Zuccari established also an astronomical library in the san Gaudioso observatory. In four years the collection grew from 195 to 620 books. Zuccari acquired some of these books from the Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode, the secretary of Neapolitan embassy in Vienna Severo Gargani, and the Paris booksellers of the King of the Two Sicilies, Borel and Pichard.In the middle of 1815, Ferdinand I of Bourbon was back to being the king of Naples and he called in the capital the astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi to supervise the conclusion of building works with the help of Pietro Bianchi, the architect of Basilica of San francesco di Paola. The new observatory was completed in the autumn of 1819.

All three brigades of the St George militia are represented, with their flag-bearers carrying flags in the colours orange, white or blue. These officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait. The man with the commander's staff situated third from lower left with the orange sash and orange feather in his hat is the Colonel Johan Claesz Loo, who heads the militia. The other officers are carrying partisans with tassles (captains), spontoons (lieutenants) or halberds (sergeants).\nThe men featured in the foreground are from left to right Ensign Lambert Woutersz (with orange flag), Sergeant Gabriel Loreyn, Colonel Johan Claesz Loo, Lieutenant Francois Woutersz, Captain Michiel de Wael, Lieutenant Cornelis Coning, Captain Florens van der Hoeff, Captain Nicolaes Grisz Grauwert, Sergeant Lucas van Tetterode, Captain Quirijn Jansz Damast, Ensign Dirck Dicx (with blue flag), and Ensign Pieter Schout (with white flag).\nThe men in the background are from upper left, Sergeant Pieter de Jong, Frans Hals (self-portrait), Ensign Jacob Druyvesteyn, Lieutenant Hendrik Gerritsz Pot, Sergeant Nicolaes van Loo, Sergeant Abraham Cornelisz van der Schalcken, and Lieutenant Hendrick Coning.\nThough a member of the militia, Frans Hals was never assigned the rank of an officer, though he was clearly admired as an important local artist, as was his fellow portraitist Pot, also portrayed in the rear lineup (and who features in two schutterstukken for the other militia in town - the St Adriansdoelen, or Cluveniers). Historians have speculated whether the self-portrait is indeed Hals, or another absent officer (none of the schutterstukken Hals painted were complete representations of all officers; the men paid for their portraits and some men \"skipped\" a painting). By the time Hals painted this painting, he had been a soldier of the guard for 25 years, and it had been 23 years since he completed his first schutterstuk for this militia, a highly unusual length of time between commissions for any artist of his time.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_43918", "text": "Besides showing local painters Hals and Pot, two other men in the rear lineup were relatives of local painters; Lieutenant Cornelis Coning was an engraver, Ensign Jacob Druyvesteyn was the son of Aart Jansz Druyvesteyn, and Sergeant Abraham Cornelisz van der Schalcken was the father of Cornelis Symonsz van der Schalcke, who some say painted the original landscape in this painting, though this was partially overpainted in 1702.

It is the fourth location to serve as the team's home field since the team was founded in 1914. After playing their first few seasons at a makeshift field at the bottom of the hill on the original campus, the team played at Rockwell Field from 1920 to 1941, then the southeastern edge of campus. Rockwell Field was also shared with the football and track teams. In 1942, the team moved to a new field along Summit Street that was part of a Works Progress Administration project that also included an adjacent football field surrounded by a cinder track, later known as Memorial Stadium. This baseball field, often referred to just as the \"varsity baseball field\" served as home to the Flashes until 1960, when the site was needed for construction of a new academic building, later named Bowman Hall. A new field, located on the opposite end of Memorial Stadium from the previous field, opened in 1961, and was often referred to as Memorial Field or \"Memorial baseball field\". While at Memorial Field, in 1964, the team qualified for its first NCAA tournament and hosted the eventual national champion Minnesota Golden Gophers in the district round of the 1964 NCAA University Division baseball tournament. Memorial Field served as the Flashes' home field through the 1965 season when that site was needed for construction of the university's new 12-story library and a science classroom building later named Williams Hall. \nThe first game at the current baseball field, which had no official name, was May 3, 1966 against the Ohio State Buckeyes. Initial plans called for the new field to be adjacent to a new football stadium, but the stadium would later be built at a different site further east as Dix Stadium. By 1969, the new varsity baseball field was referred to as Allerton Field as Allerton Street was nearest street at the time of the field's construction. It was a natural grass field with wooden bleacher seating for approximately 700 people. After the conclusion of the 1989 season, a grandstand was added behind home plate, replacing the original wooden bleachers and increasing the seating capacity to approximately 1,000.

Rockwell Field was also shared with the football and track teams. In 1942, the team moved to a new field along Summit Street that was part of a Works Progress Administration project that also included an adjacent football field surrounded by a cinder track, later known as Memorial Stadium. This baseball field, often referred to just as the \"varsity baseball field\" served as home to the Flashes until 1960, when the site was needed for construction of a new academic building, later named Bowman Hall. A new field, located on the opposite end of Memorial Stadium from the previous field, opened in 1961, and was often referred to as Memorial Field or \"Memorial baseball field\". While at Memorial Field, in 1964, the team qualified for its first NCAA tournament and hosted the eventual national champion Minnesota Golden Gophers in the district round of the 1964 NCAA University Division baseball tournament. Memorial Field served as the Flashes' home field through the 1965 season when that site was needed for construction of the university's new 12-story library and a science classroom building later named Williams Hall. \nThe first game at the current baseball field, which had no official name, was May 3, 1966 against the Ohio State Buckeyes.

The British branch of the label was founded on 8 August 1923 as the Parlophone Company Limited (the Parlophone Co. Ltd.), which developed a reputation in the 1920s as a jazz record label. On 5 October 1926, the Columbia Graphophone Company acquired Parlophone's business, name, logo, and release library, and merged with the Gramophone Company on 31 March 1931 to become Electric & Musical Industries Limited (EMI). George Martin joined Parlophone in 1950 as assistant to Oscar Preuss (who had set up the London branch of the company in 1923), the label manager, taking over as manager in 1955. Martin produced and released a mix of recordings, including by comedian Peter Sellers, pianist Mrs Mills, and teen idol Adam Faith.\nIn 1962, Martin signed the Beatles, a beat group from Liverpool who earlier that year had been rejected by Decca Records. During the 1960s, when Cilla Black, Billy J. Kramer, the Fourmost, and the Hollies also signed, Parlophone became one of the world's most famous labels. For several years, Parlophone claimed the best-selling UK single, \"She Loves You\", and the best-selling UK album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, both by the Beatles. The label placed seven singles at number 1 during 1964, when it claimed top spot on the UK Albums Chart for 40 weeks.

They imported seeds and vegetables from China and exported pigs and eggs to Hong Kong, Taipei, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore. The two brothers, who were virtually penniless, managed to scrape together enough capital to start their tiny seed shop. For the first few years of the businesses existence, the two brothers experimented to find their own market niche. By the 1950s, the shop began to specialize in exporting animal feed, particularly for chickens but the business struggled until the 1970s when the Bangkok Bank asked it to assume control of a bankrupt chicken farm. The shop later specialized in purchasing grown chickens for distribution to grocers and restaurants with vertically integrated strategy of feed-milling operations with chicken breeding. In 1969, the company had an annual turnover of US$1\u20132 million.When the Thai economy was liberalized in the 1970s, the CP Group entered various business negotiations with several major Thai banks, the Thai government, and foreign firms. The CP Group would supply Thai farmers with chicks and feed and teach breeders how to raise chickens while the farmers would sell the grown chickens back to the CP Group which processed the chickens and sold them to high volume grocery stores, restaurants, and fast food franchises across Thailand. The CP Group expanded internationally exporting their contract farming formula across Southeast Asia and around the world to Mexico, Taiwan, Portugal, Mainland China, Indonesia, Turkey, and the United States. By the 1980s, with Thailand becoming a full blown capitalist economy, the CP Group entered the aquaculture business, turning their formula to raising and marketing shrimp.The company increased its scope from selling vegetable seeds under the trademark of \"Rua Bin\" ('Aeroplane') to production of animal feed under Ek Chor's two elder sons, Jaran Chiaravanont and Montri Jiaravanont. The company further integrated its  business to include livestock farming, marketing, and distribution, under Dhanin Chearavanont. By the 1970s, the company had a virtual monopoly on the supply of chicken and eggs in Thailand. The company was known for vertical integration, expanding into several business lines, adding breeding farms, slaughterhouses, processed foods production, and, later, its own chain of restaurants.  CP had also gone international, launching feed mill operations in Indonesia in 1972, exporting chickens to Japan in 1973, then moving into Singapore in 1976.In the 1980s, as mainland China opened up to foreign direct investment, the firm became the preferred partner for international brands such as Honda, Walmart, and Tesco. CP's family ties with the mainland enabled it to become the first foreign company to establish itself in the newly created Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, where the company set up its Chia Tai Co. (Chinese: \u6b63\u5927\u96c6\u56e2; pinyin: Zh\u00e8ngd\u00e0 J\u00edtu\u00e1n) subsidiary. In 1987, the company acquired the rights to the 7-Eleven convenience store chain and the KFC fast food restaurant chain. The company would also expand into Shanghai by manufacturing motorcycles under license from Honda and brewing beer with a license from Heineken. In 1989, CP entered the petrochemical business with Solvay of Belgium to launch Vinythai Co., a manufacturer of polyvinylchloride. In 1990, the CP Group acquired a stake in TelecomAsia, a joint venture with US telecommunications firm NYNEX to build and operate two million telephone lines in Bangkok worth some US$3 billion.  The CP Group also acquired interests in satellite launch, cable television, and mobile telephone services.By the early-1990s, CP presided over some 200 subsidiaries in China. CP's investment in poultry production on the mainland was credited with changing the country's dietary habits, as per capita consumption more than doubled by the end of the decade. Starting in 1993, many subsidiaries went public. TA, Charoen Pokphand Feedmill, Siam Makro, and Vinythai were listed publicly on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET); its Hong Kong subsidiary, CP Pokphand, on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange; a Shanghai-based animal feed and poultry group on the Shanghai exchange; a real estate development arm, Hong Kong Fortune, on the Hong Kong Exchange; and Ek Chor China Motorcycle on the New York Stock Exchange. Having been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 1981, CP Lotus, a retail arm of CP Group in China, opened its first store in Shanghai in 1997.After the Asian financial crisis in 1997, CP consolidated into three business lines under its main brands: foods (CP Foods), retail (7-Eleven), and telecommunications (True). By the early-2000s, the CP Group claimed US$9 billion in business assets. The company sold its stakes in the Tesco Lotus venture with Tesco in 2003 due to its crisis policy in order to focus on 7-Eleven, in which, unlike Tesco, CP owns a majority, as its flagship retail arm.\nIn 2013, Charoen Pokphand has got clearance to buy HSBC's stake of Chinese Ping An Insurance. On 10 May 2013, in spite of a lack of loan from the China Development Bank, HSBC said \"it was selling the 15.6 percent stake at HK$59 a share\" to Charoen Pokphand Group.In 2014, CP announced a tie-up with the Japanese general trading company Itochu under which CP acquired 4.9 percent of Itochu's listed stock for about US$1 billion, and Itochu in turn acquired a 25 percent stake in a Hong Kong-listed CP group company, CP Pokphand Co., for about US$854 million. This transaction made CP the third-largest shareholder in Itochu, and was marketed as an alliance between the two conglomerates with a focus on developing international food trading opportunities. In 2015, CP and Itochu announced that they would jointly take a US$10.4 billion stake in China's CITIC Limited, forming a trilateral alliance with Itochu and CP each holding 10 percent of CITIC's stock, one of the largest foreign investments in a Chinese state-owned company.On 9 March 2020, CP Group submitted the winning bid to purchase Thai retailer, Tesco Lotus, for about US$10.6 billion. The purchase needed the approval of the Office of Trade Competition Commission (OTCC) as it could constitute a monopoly, given that CP already owns 7-Eleven convenience stores and the Makro cash-and-carry business. The sale became approved in Malaysia in November 2020 and in Thailand in December 2020, with rebranding of the acquired stores beginning in February 2021, replacing the Tesco corporate branding with that of Lotus's. \nIn February 2021, CP Group was recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies 2021\" award from Ethisphere Institute, a global institution for evaluating ethical business standards.In September 2021, CP Group raised $150 million from existing investors, raising the valuation of its Ascend Money subsidiary to $1.5 billion.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_44089", "text": "After a several-month-long investigation, in 2014 the British newspaper The Guardian reported that Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods purchases fishmeal, which it then feeds to its farmed prawns, from suppliers that own, operate or buy from fishing boats manned with slaves.

By the 1970s, the company had a virtual monopoly on the supply of chicken and eggs in Thailand. The company was known for vertical integration, expanding into several business lines, adding breeding farms, slaughterhouses, processed foods production, and, later, its own chain of restaurants.  CP had also gone international, launching feed mill operations in Indonesia in 1972, exporting chickens to Japan in 1973, then moving into Singapore in 1976.In the 1980s, as mainland China opened up to foreign direct investment, the firm became the preferred partner for international brands such as Honda, Walmart, and Tesco. CP's family ties with the mainland enabled it to become the first foreign company to establish itself in the newly created Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, where the company set up its Chia Tai Co. (Chinese: \u6b63\u5927\u96c6\u56e2; pinyin: Zh\u00e8ngd\u00e0 J\u00edtu\u00e1n) subsidiary. In 1987, the company acquired the rights to the 7-Eleven convenience store chain and the KFC fast food restaurant chain. The company would also expand into Shanghai by manufacturing motorcycles under license from Honda and brewing beer with a license from Heineken. In 1989, CP entered the petrochemical business with Solvay of Belgium to launch Vinythai Co., a manufacturer of polyvinylchloride. In 1990, the CP Group acquired a stake in TelecomAsia, a joint venture with US telecommunications firm NYNEX to build and operate two million telephone lines in Bangkok worth some US$3 billion.  The CP Group also acquired interests in satellite launch, cable television, and mobile telephone services.By the early-1990s, CP presided over some 200 subsidiaries in China. CP's investment in poultry production on the mainland was credited with changing the country's dietary habits, as per capita consumption more than doubled by the end of the decade. Starting in 1993, many subsidiaries went public. TA, Charoen Pokphand Feedmill, Siam Makro, and Vinythai were listed publicly on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET); its Hong Kong subsidiary, CP Pokphand, on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange; a Shanghai-based animal feed and poultry group on the Shanghai exchange; a real estate development arm, Hong Kong Fortune, on the Hong Kong Exchange; and Ek Chor China Motorcycle on the New York Stock Exchange. Having been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 1981, CP Lotus, a retail arm of CP Group in China, opened its first store in Shanghai in 1997.After the Asian financial crisis in 1997, CP consolidated into three business lines under its main brands: foods (CP Foods), retail (7-Eleven), and telecommunications (True). By the early-2000s, the CP Group claimed US$9 billion in business assets. The company sold its stakes in the Tesco Lotus venture with Tesco in 2003 due to its crisis policy in order to focus on 7-Eleven, in which, unlike Tesco, CP owns a majority, as its flagship retail arm.\nIn 2013, Charoen Pokphand has got clearance to buy HSBC's stake of Chinese Ping An Insurance. On 10 May 2013, in spite of a lack of loan from the China Development Bank, HSBC said \"it was selling the 15.6 percent stake at HK$59 a share\" to Charoen Pokphand Group.In 2014, CP announced a tie-up with the Japanese general trading company Itochu under which CP acquired 4.9 percent of Itochu's listed stock for about US$1 billion, and Itochu in turn acquired a 25 percent stake in a Hong Kong-listed CP group company, CP Pokphand Co., for about US$854 million. This transaction made CP the third-largest shareholder in Itochu, and was marketed as an alliance between the two conglomerates with a focus on developing international food trading opportunities. In 2015, CP and Itochu announced that they would jointly take a US$10.4 billion stake in China's CITIC Limited, forming a trilateral alliance with Itochu and CP each holding 10 percent of CITIC's stock, one of the largest foreign investments in a Chinese state-owned company.On 9 March 2020, CP Group submitted the winning bid to purchase Thai retailer, Tesco Lotus, for about US$10.6 billion. The purchase needed the approval of the Office of Trade Competition Commission (OTCC) as it could constitute a monopoly, given that CP already owns 7-Eleven convenience stores and the Makro cash-and-carry business. The sale became approved in Malaysia in November 2020 and in Thailand in December 2020, with rebranding of the acquired stores beginning in February 2021, replacing the Tesco corporate branding with that of Lotus's. \nIn February 2021, CP Group was recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies 2021\" award from Ethisphere Institute, a global institution for evaluating ethical business standards.In September 2021, CP Group raised $150 million from existing investors, raising the valuation of its Ascend Money subsidiary to $1.5 billion.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_44089", "text": "After a several-month-long investigation, in 2014 the British newspaper The Guardian reported that Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods purchases fishmeal, which it then feeds to its farmed prawns, from suppliers that own, operate or buy from fishing boats manned with slaves.

The painting depicts the \"Prussian Homage\", a significant political event from the time of the Renaissance in Poland in which Albrecht of Hohenzollern, the Duke of Prussia paid tribute and swore allegiance to King Sigismund I the Old in Krak\u00f3w's market square on 10 April 1525. Matejko depicted over thirty important figures of the Polish Renaissance period, taking the liberty of including several who were not actually present at the event.\nThe painting glorifies this event in Poland's past and its culture, and the majesty of its kings. At the same time, the painting has darker undertones, reflecting the troubled times that befell Poland in the late eighteenth century, for the Kingdom of Prussia would become one of the partitioning powers that ended the independence of Poland. The painting was seen by some as anti-Prussian, foretelling its perceived betrayal of Poland; others have noted it is also critical of Poland, as Matejko included signs that signify this seemingly triumphant moment was a hollow, wasted victory.

Rockefeller's Standard Oil. The company, which took its present name in 1999 per the merger of Exxon and Mobil, is vertically integrated across the entire oil and gas industry, and within it is also a chemicals division which produces plastic, synthetic rubber, and other chemical products. ExxonMobil is headquartered near the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, though officially incorporated in the U.S. state of New Jersey.:\u200a1\u200a It is the largest United States-based oil and gas producing company. ExxonMobil is also the eighth largest company in the world by revenue and the third largest in the US.\nThe company\u2019s history traces its earliest roots to 1866, with the formation of the Vacuum Oil Company, itself acquired by Standard Oil in 1879. The company that is today known as ExxonMobil grew out of the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), the corporate entity which effectively controlled all of Standard Oil prior to its breakup. Jersey Standard grew alongside and with extensive partnership another Standard Oil descendant and its future merger partner, the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), both of which grew bigger by merging with various third companies like Humble Oil (which merged with Jersey Standard) and Vacuum Oil (merged with Socony). Both companies underwent rebranding in the 1960s and early 1970s, and by the time of the 1999 merger, Jersey Standard had been known as Exxon, and Socony known as Mobil. The merger agreement between Exxon and Mobil stipulated that Exxon would buy Mobil and rebrand as ExxonMobil, with Mobil's CEO becoming the vice-chairman of the company. The archival records of the company and its predecessors dating back to the 1970s are held by The Center for American History at The University of Texas at Austin.ExxonMobil is one of the world's largest and most powerful companies. Since its merger, the company has varied from the first to tenth largest publicly traded company by revenue, and has one of the largest market capitalizations out of any company. As of 2023, in the most recent rankings released in the Fortune 500, ExxonMobil was ranked third, and twelfth on the Fortune Global 500. It is the largest investor-owned oil company in the world, the largest oil company headquartered in the Western world, and the largest of the Big Oil companies in both production and market value. Its reserves were 20 billion BOE at the end of 2016 and the 2007 rates of production were expected to last more than 14 years. With 21 oil refineries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 4.9 million barrels (780,000 m3), ExxonMobil is the second largest oil refiner in the world, trailing only Sinopec. Approximately 55.56% of the company's shares are held by institutions, the largest of which as of 2019 were The Vanguard Group (8.15%), BlackRock (6.61%), and State Street Corporation (4.83%).\nExxonMobil has been widely criticized, mostly for environmental incidents and its history of climate change denial against the scientific consensus that fossil fuels significantly contribute to global warming. The company is responsible for many oil spills, the largest and most notable of which was the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska and itself considered to be one of the world's worst oil spills in terms of damage to the environment.

The modern castle dates from between the 15th and early 17th centuries, when the successive ruling families of the Herberts and the Somersets created a luxurious, fortified castle, complete with a large hexagonal keep, known as the Great Tower or the Yellow Tower of Gwent. Surrounded by parkland, water gardens and terraces, the castle was considered by contemporaries to be the equal of any other in England or Wales.\nDuring the First English Civil War, Raglan was occupied by a Royalist garrison on behalf of Charles I but was taken by Parliamentarian forces in 1646 and its walls slighted, or deliberately put beyond military use. After the Stuart Restoration in 1660, the Somersets declined to restore it and it became first a source of local building materials, then a romantic ruin.

The castle was built in stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would ride through Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, around the edge of the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then would a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.There has been much discussion amongst academics about the extent to which Raglan was influenced by contemporary French designs; one school of thought suggests that it was heavily influenced by designs that were then popular in the south of France; others oppose this \"diffusionist\" school of thought, and argue that there is insufficient evidence to draw such a conclusion. Another line of debate has been over the nature of the castle's defences, in particular its gunloops.

The construction of the existing yard commenced in 1875 when the Prussian state railways decided to build a marshalling yard to sort freight wagons using the new Ringbahn. It was opened on 1 September 1879 as the first railway yard of its kind in the Berlin area. For the first time sloping tracks were used for shunting. A connection was built as a two-track line running from the yard to the west to the Ringbahn.\nIn 1902, the Lower Silesian-Markish Railway was rebuilt with four tracks, with the northern pair reserved for suburban traffic. The marshalling yard was converted in 1914 to a depot for storing passenger carriages. There was also a station on the suburban tracks, which was initially reserved for workers at the carriage depot. Since 11 June 1928, the suburban trains have been operated electrically and since 1 December 1930, the services have been branded as the \"S-Bahn\".\nThe Welthauptstadt Germania plans of the Nazis envisaged a major expansion of the railway infrastructure in Rummelsburg to serve as a point for marshalling trains for a new Ostbahnhof (\u201cEast station\u201d) to be built at Ostkreuz. However, the plans remained only on paper.\nOn 5 January 1948, the S-Bahn station was opened for general passenger traffic.\nIn the 1970s, the yard was used almost exclusively for storing passenger trains. From 1980, a storage and treatment plant was built for the transit trains that ran between West Berlin and the West Germany without stopping in East Germany, which were inaugurated on 15 December 1983. The infrastructure was co-financed by West Germany under an intra-German Transit Agreement that came into force after 1972.The Rummelsburg Intercity Express (ICE) depot trains was opened in 1998 for the servicing of ICE trains that begin or end in Berlin to coincide with the renovation of the Berlin Stadtbahn. Together with the depot for express carriages, the site is just under two kilometres long and 400 meters wide. In 2002, the facility was extended with the addition of another five workshop tracks.\nA renewal of facilities for the servicing of passenger rollingstock is planned. Thus, the central hall will be rebuilt, the engine shed and the large wagon shed will be extended and three new maintenance platforms will be built.

This axis terminates shortly after the conurbation on the line of Basingstoke, then an agrarian market town. The route therefore missed the towns of Guildford, Farnham and Alton which would have boosted early revenue. The railway was also forced to narrowly bypass the town of Kingston-upon-Thames due to the commercial justification that the railway would damage the town's importance for stagecoaches combined with the cost of boring a tunnel through the town's easterly hill. The city of Winchester north of Southampton was included in the built and in the unbuilt proposal, seeing its station open in 1839.\nThe Great Western Railway (GWR) secured its patrons for a far more direct route to Bristol, particularly influential landowners in Berkshire and Wiltshire. The GWR received Parliamentary authority and shortly afterwards the Southampton railway. The SL&BRDC held to its chosen route including Basingstoke, though changed its name to the London and Southampton Railway, and later the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR). Throughout the 19th century, the L&SWR and Great Western Railway were often in competition with each other over serving destinations and frequently sought and gained permission to build railways into each other's intended \"territory\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_44281", "text": "The first section to be opened was from Nine Elms, the LSWR's first London terminus, in Battersea, to Woking (then named Woking Common) on 21 May 1838.\nThe remainder of the main line followed over the next two years:\n\nWoking to Winchfield (Shapley Heath): 24 September 1838\nWinchfield to Basingstoke: 10 June 1839\nWinchester to Southampton: 10 June 1839\nBasingstoke to Winchester: 11 May 1840.

{"id": "127_538", "question": "Who owns Hyde Road?", "ctxs": [{"id": "127_44284", "text": "Hyde Road was a football stadium in West Gorton, Manchester, England. It was home to Manchester City F.C. and their predecessors from its construction in 1887 until 1923, when the club moved to Maine Road. It was named after Hyde Road, a road which begins at the east end of Ardwick Green South in Ardwick and runs east towards Hyde. At the boundary between Gorton and Denton it continues as Manchester Road.Before its use as a football ground, the site was an area of waste ground, and in its early days the ground had only rudimentary facilities. The first stand was built in 1888, but the ground had no changing facilities until 1896; players had to change in a nearby public house, the Hyde Road Hotel. By 1904 the ground had developed into a 40,000-capacity venue, hosting an FA Cup semi-final between Newcastle United and The Wednesday the following year.\nThe stands and terraces were arranged in a haphazard manner due to space constraints, and by 1920 the club had outgrown the cramped venue. A decision to seek an alternative venue was hastened in November 1920, when the Main Stand was destroyed by fire. Manchester City moved to the 80,000-capacity Maine Road in 1923, and Hyde Road was demolished shortly afterward. One structure from the ground is still in use in the 21st century, a section of roofing which was sold for use at The Shay, a stadium in Halifax.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_44285", "text": "From the club's inception in 1880, Manchester City \u2013 first known as St Mark's (West Gorton), then as West Gorton A.F.C. and by mid-1884 as just Gorton A.F.C. \u2013 had struggled to find a stable location to base themselves. Originally simply playing on a dangerously bumpy patch of grass near to the church of their origin, the club quickly signed an agreement to ground-share with the Kirkmanshulme Cricket Club before being turfed out only a year later. Three further pitches were then created on wasteland over the following four seasons, but all proved inadequate for one reason or another. When their fifth pitch arrangement collapsed in 1887, with the landlord of the Bulls Head Hotel demanding a rent increase for the use of a nearby field, the club were forced to seek an alternative venue. Then-captain Kenneth McKenzie discovered an area of waste ground on Hyde Road in Ardwick and near to his place of work, and informed the club committee. Lawrence Furniss, the club secretary, ascertained that the ground was owned by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Company. Following an initial letter of enquiry by Gorton player Walter Chew to railway company estate agent Edwin Barker, Furniss and Chew negotiated a seven-month lease at a cost of \u00a310, and the club changed its name to \"Ardwick A.F.C.\" to reflect the new location. A few weeks later, using materials provided by the nearby Galloway engineering works, a rudimentary football ground was ready for use. The ground had no changing rooms, and teams changed in a nearby public house, the Hyde Road Hotel, where the football club held business meetings. The ground's first seating area was built in 1888, with 1,000 seats, paid for by Chesters Brewery in return for the right to be the sole provider of alcohol inside the ground. Ardwick were admitted to the Football League in 1892. The first league match held at Hyde Road was a 7\u20130 Ardwick win against Bootle on 3 September 1892. Two years later the club reformed as \"Manchester City F.C.\"\n\nThe increasing popularity of the football club resulted in improvements being made to the ground on several occasions. Improvements costing \u00a3600 were made in 1890, and changing rooms were provided in 1896. A new stand was purchased for \u00a31,500 in 1898, and \u00a32,000 worth of improvements were made in 1904, resulting in a capacity of 40,000 with stands on three sides. This development resulted in Hyde Road being chosen to host two prestigious matches\u2014an inter-league match between the English League and the Irish League, and an FA Cup semi-final between Newcastle United and The Wednesday. In 1910 multi-span roofing was built on the three previously uncovered sides of the ground, resulting in covered accommodation for 35,000 spectators.Even though improvements were made the ground suffered problems when hosting large crowds, due to narrow surrounding streets and a shortage of turnstiles. A reporter for the Manchester Football News summarised the access problems: \"The croft is a nightmare in wet weather, and altogether the approach is easily the worst of any I know\". On occasion, further problems occurred inside the ground as well as outside. A 1913 cup tie against Sunderland drew a crowd officially recorded as 41,709, but believed to be significantly higher. An hour before kick-off the gates were closed, with many ticket-holders unable to gain admission. The crowd was so large that once the match kicked off the crowd began to spill onto the pitch, a problem which worsened as the game progressed. Sunderland's Charles Buchan recalled that \"Before half-time they were three or four yards inside the touchlines.\" A Sunderland goal in the 58th minute caused further encroachment, forcing the referee to abandon the match. An FA inquiry into the events on the terraces gave rise to debate on the issue of crowd control at sporting events. Use of mounted police was a particularly contentious issue, the chairman of the committee asking \"If the ball struck a horse, and the creature plunged among the people, who was to be held responsible for any injuries that might accrue?\" For years the club contemplated moving but between 1912 and 1914 renowned football stadium architect Archibald Leitch worked with the club to remodel the Hyde Road site.\nDuring the suspension of competitive football in the First World War, Hyde Road's redevelopment was put on hold and the venue was used to stable 300 horses. Later in the wartime period the club became the sole leaseholder of the ground, no longer dependent upon support from Chesters brewery. At this point the annual rent was \u00a3500. In 1920, the ground became the first football venue outside London to be visited by a reigning monarch; King George V attended the ground to watch a match between Manchester City and Liverpool. In November a fire caused by a cigarette end destroyed the Main Stand, and Manchester City began to seek a new home. Initial discussions raised the possibility of sharing Old Trafford with neighbours Manchester United, but United's proposed rent was prohibitive, so repair work was undertaken and Manchester City continued to play at Hyde Road.Plans for the club to move to a new ground\u2014Maine Road\u2014in Moss Side were announced in 1922. The final Manchester City match at Hyde Road was a league fixture against Newcastle United on 28 April 1923, and in August 1923 a public practice game was the last football match played at Hyde Road. Manchester City began the 1923\u201324 season at Maine Road, which had an 80,000 capacity. Parts of Hyde Road were used elsewhere; the roof of the Main Stand was sold to Halifax Town, and erected at The Shay, where even in the 21st century, part of the Hyde Road roof is still in place. Within a decade, all traces of the football ground had disappeared from Hyde Road. The bulk of the area was taken over by Manchester Corporation Tramways department, whose major Hyde Road depot and works was alongside, for use as their Permanent Way yard for assembling and storing tramway rails and materials. The Tramways system also provided at this time a substantial parcels handling service within the city, using both vans and special parcels trams, and a new central parcels depot was built on the Bennett Street side of the former site, against the railway viaduct. After the end of Manchester's trams in 1949 (most of the old trams were scrapped on this site) it was used for storing old buses and as a bus drivers' training area.

Organizationally, these changes were launched on July 1, less than two months before the rebrand was made official. The merger of the teams behind the two channels created a larger team for Kanal 1. Such merger allowed rationings that, over time, led to an increase in programming time. Kanal 1 got its drama unit, Kanal 1 Drama, which became the largest drama producer in the Nordic region. Increased competition from commercial channels, including TV4, led to another relaunch as SVT1 in 1996, incorporating programming produced from across the country again.\nA major corporate revamp in 2001 saw the channel repositioned as SVT's flagship network to make it the most-watched television station in Sweden - a position previously held by SVT2. As part of the revamp, TV2's popular news programme Rapport (Report) moved to the first network while Aktuellt moved to the second network.\nAlongside Rapport, SVT's main entertainment shows air on the first channel, including Melodifestivalen, S\u00e5 ska det l\u00e5ta and P\u00e5 sp\u00e5ret are broadcast on this channel.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_44415", "text": "On weekdays, a typical broadcast day on SVT1 begins with the breakfast programme Morgonstudion (lit., \"The Morning Studio\") followed by a mix of repeats of the previous night's primetime lineup, films, TV series, magazine shows, and documentaries throughout the day as well as live sport. The main evening schedule usually airs from around 5 pm until midnight with the main 25-minute edition of Rapport at 7:30 pm, alongside shorter bulletins at 6 pm and later in the evening.

It is 562 feet (171 m) tall and with the Mies designed post office and plaza stands on the site previously occupied by the Chicago Federal Building by the architect Henry Ives Cobb. It was named in honor of U.S. Congressman John C. Kluczynski, who represented Illinois's 5th congressional district from 1951 to 1975 after his death that year. This is one of three buildings by van der Rohe in the Federal Center Plaza complex: the others are the Loop Station Post Office and the Everett McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse.\nThe Kluczynski Building is constructed of a steel frame and contains 1,200,000 sq ft (110,000 m2) of space.  The exterior is sheathed in bronze-tinted glass set into bright aluminum frames.  Beneath the windows are steel spandrel panels painted flat black and windows are separated horizontally by steel mullions of projecting steel I-beams also painted black.  The two-story lobby is recessed allowing for a colonnade or pilotis to encircle the building at street level.  The interior walls and floors of the lobby are covered in granite which extends to the plaza.  The lobby contains several commemorative tablets which were removed from the previous building.\nThe entire complex is based on a 28 ft (8.5 m) grid pattern so that seams of the granite pavers in the plaza extend into the building lobbies and up the sides to create unity among the three structures.  The Center is similar to  Mies' earlier Toronto-Dominion Centre and was expanded in 1991 with the addition of the 28-story Metcalfe Federal Building to the south across Jackson Boulevard.On August 28, 1996, eleven people were arrested while doing a demonstration at the building.In 2009, GSA undertook a major project to improve energy efficiency which included solar film on windows, LED lighting, upgraded HVAC and other mechanical systems. After the work, the building received a LEED Silver certification.Alexander Calder's sculpture Flamingo, a 53-foot  (16 m) red steel sculpture, was unveiled on the plaza October 24, 1974.  The sculpture was conserved and restored in 1998.  The plaza is also the site of a weekly farmers' market during the spring and summer seasons, open to the community.\nFederal agencies in the building include the Air Force Recruiting Service, the Department of State Passport Agency, Department of Labor, Internal Revenue Service, Office of Personnel Management, Consumer Product Safety Commission, General Services Administration and offices for both the U.S. senators from Illinois, Richard \"Dick\" Durbin and Tammy Duckworth.Following his election as president on November 4, 2008, Barack Obama established his administration's transitional offices in the federal building, prompting heightened security measures in the surrounding area.", "hasanswer": true}]}

This remained in use until 1988, after which a natural grass pitch was reintroduced.\nRugby union team London Wasps shared the ground with QPR between 1996 and 2002 and Premier League football club Fulham shared it from 2002 to 2004 while Craven Cottage was closed for reconstruction. AFC Wimbledon started the 2020\u20132021 season sharing the ground while they waited for their new stadium in Merton to be finished. Other users of the stadium have included the Jamaican and Australian national football teams. In 1985, Barry McGuigan defeated Eusebio Pedroza for the World Boxing Association featherweight championship at the stadium.\nOn 7 June 2019, the club gifted the naming rights to the stadium to The Kiyan Prince Foundation, a charity set up in honour of former QPR youth player Kiyan Prince, resulting in the stadium becoming known as the Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium. On 25 May 2022, the club announced that the stadium name would revert to Loftus Road ahead of the 2022\u201323 season.On 26 October 2023, the club announced that it had signed a three-year agreement to sell the naming rights of the stadium to MATRADE; thus Loftus Road will be known as the \"MATRADE Loftus Road Stadium\" until the 2025\u201326 season.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_44702", "text": "The ground was first used on 11 October 1904 by Shepherd's Bush, an amateur side that was disbanded during the First World War. QPR moved to Loftus Road in 1917, having had their ground at Park Royal commandeered by the army in February 1915. At that time the ground was an open field with a pavilion. One stand from Park Royal was dismantled and re-erected in 1919, forming the Ellerslie Road stand. This stand was the only covered seating in the ground until 1968 and was replaced in 1972. It had a capacity of 2,950.QPR moved out of Loftus Road at the start of the 1931\u201332 season, moving to nearby White City Stadium, but after a loss of \u00a37,000, the team moved back for the start of the 1933\u201334 season. In 1938, a new covered terrace for 6,000 spectators was constructed by a company called Framed Structures Ltd at the Loftus Road end, taking the overall ground capacity up to 30,000. It cost \u00a37,000 (with \u00a31,500 donated by the QPR Supporters Club) and was opened by the Rt Hon Herbert Morrison, the leading Labour MP and future wartime Home Secretary, at the match against Crystal Palace on 29 October. The covered section of the terracing was concreted at that time; the uncovered section was concreted in 1945.\nIn April 1948, after winning the Third Division (South) championship, the club bought the freehold of the stadium plus 39 houses in Loftus Road and Ellerslie Road for \u00a326,250, financed by a share flotation that raised \u00a330,000. When the club's finances were under pressure in the late 1950s the houses had to be sold. On 5 October 1953 floodlights were used at Loftus Road for the first time for a friendly game against Arsenal. In summer 1966 the original floodlights were replaced by much taller floodlight pylons. In summer 1980 these in turn were replaced with new floodlights.\nQPR experimented once again with a move to White City Stadium in the 1962\u201363 season, but moved back to Loftus Road once more after less than one full season. In the summer of 1968 the South Africa Road stand was constructed at a cost of \u00a3150,000 to replace the old open terracing. In 1972 a new stand was completed in Ellerslie Road, replacing the tin-roofed grandstand erected in 1919, and first used in the match against Oxford United on 2 December 1972. The changing rooms and offices were moved to South Africa Road and the television gantry moved in the other direction.\nThe stadium's highest recorded attendance of 35,353 was in a game against Leeds United on 27 April 1974. The following summer the paddock of the South Africa Road stand was converted from terracing to seating with the installation of 4,600 seats, thus lowering the capacity of the stadium to the 31,002 present for the last home match of the 1975/6 season against Leeds United on 24 April 1976.\nDuring the summer of 1981 an artificial pitch of Omniturf was installed at Loftus Road, the first such surface to be used in British professional football. The surface was not favoured by everyone, with QPR keeper Peter Hucker describing it as \"basically a bit of carpet over two feet of concrete\", and stated that as a goalkeeper, he strongly disliked diving onto it saying that \"I'd have close to third degree burns because the pitch would totally rip the skin off.\" Rangers lost the first league match played on the new surface 1-2 versus Luton Town on 1 September 1981. During the time that Loftus Road had the Omniturf pitch installed, QPR reached two cup finals and became Second Division champions, something that critics claimed was caused by the advantage the pitch presented, and QPR's home games in the 1984\u201385 UEFA Cup were played at Arsenal's Highbury Stadium. It was claimed that manager Terry Venables would let opposition teams train on the pitch when it was dry, and then deliberately dampen the pitch so that the ball played differently to what they expected at kick off. It was removed in April 1988 because of football legislation and replaced with grass. There were just three other league stadiums in the whole country with a plastic pitch, and by 1994 all of these had been ripped up.\nNew stands were opened at the School End in the summer of 1980 and one year later at the Loftus Road end. At the same time as the new Loftus Road stand was built executive boxes were installed in the lower tier of the South Africa Road stand and the artificial pitch laid. The stadium capacity at this time was 27,000 and it was one of the most modern and advanced stadiums in Britain having been completely reconstructed over a 13-year period from 1968 to 1981. Between the summer of 1994 and the start of 2022\u201323 season; Loftus Road ground was an all-seater stadium with the construction of seating in the lower Loftus Road stand. The last match where home spectators were able to watch the match from terracing was on 16 April 1994 against Everton. Standing returned to Loftus Road in 2022 when the club introduced rail seating in the ML, NL & PL blocks in the Lower Loft and the R Block in the Stanley Bowles Stand.The owning company, also called Loftus Road, of QPR, London Wasps and the stadium itself, went into the red in the late 1990s only a couple of seasons after it was formed in 1996. In 2001, there were concerns that Queens Park Rangers and the stadium would need to be sold separately when the club went into administration. There was interest from commercial buyers and housing developers. A supporter's trust was set up to keep the club at Loftus Road, and to fight the suggested move out of the stadium and to Milton Keynes. One further suggestion was a merger between QPR and fellow London club Wimbledon, with the newly merged club playing at Loftus Road, but this idea was abandoned following the response from supporters. A \u00a31 million payment by QPR's long time local rivals Fulham in 2002 helped to alleviate the financial problems in return for a ground sharing agreement while Craven Cottage was developed.Loftus Road briefly became home to non-league football club Yeading as they faced Premiership club Newcastle United in the third round of the 2005 FA Cup. The decision was made as Yeading felt that their home stadium could not suitably segregate the fans. Despite holding out for fifty minutes, Yeading went on to lose the match, 2\u20130.In a fundraiser for the Grenfell Tower fire, which happened on 14 June 2017, Loftus Road stadium hosted a special match \u2013 appropriately named 'Game 4 Grenfell' \u2013 for the people who died. Celebrities participating included Olly Murs, Sir Mo Farah and many more. This took place on 2 September 2017.\nOn 7 June 2019, following nominations and a fan vote from a shortlist, it was announced that Loftus Road Stadium would be renamed the 'Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium' in honour of the former QPR youth team member Kiyan Prince who was fatally stabbed in 2006.\nIn December 2021, it was announced that the Ellerslie Road Stand would be renamed the Stanley Bowles Stand. In February 2022 the club announced a fundraising campaign, asking supporters to pay for the planned renaming costs.Ahead of the 2022\u201323 season, the club installed just under 1000 rail seats in the ML, NL & PL blocks in the Lower Loft and the R Block in the Stanley Bowles Stand as well as the upper tier of the School End stand used by visiting supporters.In the summer of 2023 the old \"Blue and White Club\" bar in the Lower Loftus Road stand was renamed the \"Forever Rs bar\", after the former players, managers and coaches association that had been created in 2016. The bar contains memorabilia donated by both fans and the club and is used to host talks with former players and other fan related events.

The surface was not favoured by everyone, with QPR keeper Peter Hucker describing it as \"basically a bit of carpet over two feet of concrete\", and stated that as a goalkeeper, he strongly disliked diving onto it saying that \"I'd have close to third degree burns because the pitch would totally rip the skin off.\" Rangers lost the first league match played on the new surface 1-2 versus Luton Town on 1 September 1981. During the time that Loftus Road had the Omniturf pitch installed, QPR reached two cup finals and became Second Division champions, something that critics claimed was caused by the advantage the pitch presented, and QPR's home games in the 1984\u201385 UEFA Cup were played at Arsenal's Highbury Stadium. It was claimed that manager Terry Venables would let opposition teams train on the pitch when it was dry, and then deliberately dampen the pitch so that the ball played differently to what they expected at kick off. It was removed in April 1988 because of football legislation and replaced with grass. There were just three other league stadiums in the whole country with a plastic pitch, and by 1994 all of these had been ripped up.\nNew stands were opened at the School End in the summer of 1980 and one year later at the Loftus Road end. At the same time as the new Loftus Road stand was built executive boxes were installed in the lower tier of the South Africa Road stand and the artificial pitch laid. The stadium capacity at this time was 27,000 and it was one of the most modern and advanced stadiums in Britain having been completely reconstructed over a 13-year period from 1968 to 1981. Between the summer of 1994 and the start of 2022\u201323 season; Loftus Road ground was an all-seater stadium with the construction of seating in the lower Loftus Road stand. The last match where home spectators were able to watch the match from terracing was on 16 April 1994 against Everton. Standing returned to Loftus Road in 2022 when the club introduced rail seating in the ML, NL & PL blocks in the Lower Loft and the R Block in the Stanley Bowles Stand.The owning company, also called Loftus Road, of QPR, London Wasps and the stadium itself, went into the red in the late 1990s only a couple of seasons after it was formed in 1996. In 2001, there were concerns that Queens Park Rangers and the stadium would need to be sold separately when the club went into administration. There was interest from commercial buyers and housing developers. A supporter's trust was set up to keep the club at Loftus Road, and to fight the suggested move out of the stadium and to Milton Keynes. One further suggestion was a merger between QPR and fellow London club Wimbledon, with the newly merged club playing at Loftus Road, but this idea was abandoned following the response from supporters. A \u00a31 million payment by QPR's long time local rivals Fulham in 2002 helped to alleviate the financial problems in return for a ground sharing agreement while Craven Cottage was developed.Loftus Road briefly became home to non-league football club Yeading as they faced Premiership club Newcastle United in the third round of the 2005 FA Cup. The decision was made as Yeading felt that their home stadium could not suitably segregate the fans. Despite holding out for fifty minutes, Yeading went on to lose the match, 2\u20130.In a fundraiser for the Grenfell Tower fire, which happened on 14 June 2017, Loftus Road stadium hosted a special match \u2013 appropriately named 'Game 4 Grenfell' \u2013 for the people who died. Celebrities participating included Olly Murs, Sir Mo Farah and many more. This took place on 2 September 2017.\nOn 7 June 2019, following nominations and a fan vote from a shortlist, it was announced that Loftus Road Stadium would be renamed the 'Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium' in honour of the former QPR youth team member Kiyan Prince who was fatally stabbed in 2006.\nIn December 2021, it was announced that the Ellerslie Road Stand would be renamed the Stanley Bowles Stand. In February 2022 the club announced a fundraising campaign, asking supporters to pay for the planned renaming costs.Ahead of the 2022\u201323 season, the club installed just under 1000 rail seats in the ML, NL & PL blocks in the Lower Loft and the R Block in the Stanley Bowles Stand as well as the upper tier of the School End stand used by visiting supporters.In the summer of 2023 the old \"Blue and White Club\" bar in the Lower Loftus Road stand was renamed the \"Forever Rs bar\", after the former players, managers and coaches association that had been created in 2016. The bar contains memorabilia donated by both fans and the club and is used to host talks with former players and other fan related events. It also lists all of the more than 100 former players, managers and coaches inducted to \"Forever Rs\" since its creation.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_44703", "text": "The stadium has a capacity of 18,439. The four stands are the Loftus Road End (often shortened to The Loft), The Stanley Bowles Stand, Bhatia Stand and the Achilles Security Stand, the Upper Tier of which is used by away supporters with the lower tier also allocated when demand justifies it.\nBecause of the size of the stadium, supporters find themselves much closer to the pitch compared to many other stadiums. All four of the modern stands meet with no gaps, giving the overall impression of a tightly enclosed stadium. All the stands have two tiers, with the exception of the Stanley Bowles Stand.The Bhatia stand, formerly known as the South Africa Road stand, is the biggest of the four stands. It is a two tier stand which includes The Paddocks and contains a row of executive boxes separating The Paddocks and the upper tier. It also houses the dugouts, changing rooms, executive suites, tunnel, club offices, club shop, box office and press conference rooms. The Paddocks area is the cheapest in the ground, whereas the upper tier is the most expensive.

It is home to the \"Q Block\" where, along with the Loft's P and R blocks QPR's loudest and most partisan following are located. The R Block contains 237 rail seats so the rowdiest fans can stand during the game. This stand is a favourite of some fans because of the view and atmosphere, and is the second most expensive stand in the stadium.

As the home of the university's Wildcats basketball team of the Pac-12 Conference, it is primarily used for basketball, but also has physical training and therapy facilities. Its construction is marked with a large copper cap that has oxidized brown.\nIn the 1960s, it was recognized that the Wildcats' basketball venue, Bear Down Gymnasium, was outdated and in need of replacement. Major planning for the new facility began in 1966. During construction, the Wildcats briefly considered playing some of its 1971\u201372 home schedule in the then-newly completed 8,000-seat arena at the Tucson Convention Center, but eventually declined, remaining in Bear Down Gym until the new venue was ready. The new arena officially opened in February 1973 and has an official capacity of 14,688 spectators. The elevation at street level is approximately 2,450 feet (750 m) above sea level.\nThe McKale Center was named in honor of J.F. \"Pop\" McKale, a major athletic figure at U of A from 1914 to 1957.  At one time, he was head coach of all of the school's athletic teams.  He was head basketball coach from 1914 to 1921, where he achieved a 49\u201312 (.803) record. He led the football team from 1914 to 1930, with an 80\u201332\u20136 (.703) record. It was McKale's first team that resulted in Arizona's teams being nicknamed \"Wildcats.\"  In 1914, Arizona's name meant very little in the college football world.  Although they lost to Occidental College in Los Angeles 14\u20130, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times was so impressed with Arizona's effort that he wrote, \"The Arizona men showed the fight of wild cats ...\"  Soon afterward, Arizona's student-athletes were nicknamed the Wildcats.Following a win over rival Arizona State on February 26, 2000, the university athletic department honored longtime head coach Lute Olson with a ceremony to name the McKale Center playing surface \"Lute Olson Court.\" Less than a year later, during a memorial service in January 2001 for Olson's late wife, Bobbi, it was renamed, \"Lute and Bobbi Olson Court\" in recognition of the couple's impact on the university and the city of Tucson.In 2002, the Eddie Lynch Athletics Pavilion, a state-of-the-art medical and strength/conditioning facility for Wildcat student athletes, was completed and opened. The pavilion (which cost $14 million) was a 36,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) addition to the north end of McKale Center. The upper level has a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) museum-like display area, open to the public, showcasing the history of Arizona Wildcat athletics.In terms of capacity, McKale Center is the second-largest arena in the Pac-12 conference; Utah's Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City is first, but Arizona averages greater attendance.  Arizona has the current longest streak of leading its conference in attendance in conference history, going on 39 seasons & second in the country currently behind Kentucky at 45.The university's spring and winter commencement ceremonies were held at McKale Center from 1973 until 2012; the 2013 ceremonies returned to Arizona Stadium after an absence of thirty years.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_44716", "text": "In December 2012, the university athletic department was given approval by the Arizona Board of Regents to select an architect to renovate the arena. \"The hope is to get it to be where it's one concourse enclosed that you can walk around and have the restrooms and concessions and everything tied to it,\" said athletic director Greg Byrne.

Passengers had control of the heating and ventilation of their individual cabins, which in 1922 was an innovation.The ship had two screws and four turbines: two high-pressure and two low-pressure. Each screw was driven by one high-pressure and one low-pressure turbine via single-reduction gearing. Her nine water-tube boilers were oil-fuelled, and supplied steam to her high-pressure turbines at 215 psi.

On another eastbound voyage in April 1926, a passenger was lost overboard.On 29 January 1927, Volendam left Hoboken on her first cruise. It was to the Caribbean, which became her most frequent destination for winter cruises. In 1928 her passenger accommodation was revised to 263 first class, 428 second class, and 484 tourist class. In 1929 she made three Caribbean cruises, leaving Hoboken on 26 January, 16 February and 9 March. Ports of call included Port-au-Prince, Venezuela, and the Panama Canal. Haiti was then a novelty as a cruise destination, and NASM was the only company to include it in its cruises that year.\nBy 1930, Volendam's navigation equipment included wireless direction finding. Coincidentally, on a westbound crossing in June 1930, the wireless telagraphist of Charles Kingsford Smith's Fokker F.VII aircraft Southern Cross, on a 12-hour transatlantic flight to Newfoundland, contacted Volendam with a request for bearings. Volendam replied that she was at about 51\u00b0N 25\u00b0W, and that Southern Cross was about 30 nautical miles (56 km) north of her.The Great Depression that began in 1929 brought a global slump in commercial shipping. On 24 December 1930, NASM revised its fares for 1931. Fares were seasonal, and had been divided into summer, winter, and intermediate. NASM abolished the intermediate seasons, simplified the fares to summer and winter only, and announced significant reductions. On Volendam and Veendam, the minimum first class fare would be US$122.50 for summer and $165 for winter. The summer fare for a two-berth cabin with a window and ensuite bathroom was reduced from $345 to $222.50. A two-berth cabin on \"A\" deck with an outside window would be reduced from $275 or $285 to $212.50.On 3 October 1931, Volendam left Hoboken carrying $10 million in gold for banks in Amsterdam.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "127_641", "question": "Who owns Holden?", "ctxs": [{"id": "127_44739", "text": "Holden, formerly known as General Motors-Holden, was an Australian subsidiary company of General Motors.  Founded in Adelaide, South Australia, it was an automobile manufacturer, importer, and exporter that sold cars under its own marque in Australia. In its last three years, it switched entirely to importing cars. It was headquartered in Port Melbourne, with major industrial operations in the states of South Australia and Victoria. The 164-year-old company ceased trading at the end of 2020.\nHolden's primary products were its own models developed in-house, such as the Holden Commodore, Holden Caprice, and the Holden Ute. However, Holden had also offered badge-engineered models under sharing arrangements with Nissan, Suzuki, Toyota, Isuzu, and then GM subsidiaries Opel, Vauxhall Motors, and Chevrolet. The vehicle lineup had included models from GM Korea, GM Thailand, and GM North America. Holden had also distributed GM's German Opel marque in Australia in 2012 and 2013.Holden was founded in 1856 as a saddlery manufacturer in South Australia. In 1898, it moved into the automotive field. It became a subsidiary of the United States\u2013based General Motors (GM) in 1931, when the company was renamed General Motors-Holden's Ltd. It was renamed Holden Ltd in 1998 and adopted the name GM Holden Ltd in 2005.\nHolden briefly owned assembly plants in New Zealand during the early 1990s. The plants had belonged to General Motors from 1926 until 1990 in an earlier and quite separate operation from GM's Holden operations in Australia. Holden's production became increasingly concentrated in South Australia and Victoria after the Second World War. However, Holden had factories in all the mainland states of Australia when GM took over in 1931, due to the combining of Holden and GM factories around the country under Holden management. In the postwar period, this decentralisation was slowly reduced and, by 1989, the consolidation of final assembly at Elizabeth, South Australia was largely completed, except for some operations that continued at Dandenong, Victoria until 1994. Engine manufacturing was consolidated at Fishermans Bend, Victoria, which was expanded to supply markets overseas.\nAlthough Holden's involvement in exports had fluctuated from the 1950s, the declining sales of large sedan cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. In 2013, Holden revealed it received A$2.17 billion in Federal Government assistance in the past 12 years, the amount was much larger than expected. Holden blamed a strong Australian currency, high manufacturing costs and a small domestic market among the reasons for exit of local manufacturing. This led to the announcement, on 11 December 2013, that Holden would cease vehicle and engine production by the end of 2017.On 29 November 2016, engine production at the Fishermans Bend plant was shut down. On 20 October 2017, production of the last Holden designed Commodore ceased and the vehicle assembly plant at Elizabeth was shut down. Holden produced nearly 7.7 million vehicles. On 17 February 2020, General Motors announced that the Holden marque would be retired by 2021. On 30 October 2020, the GM Australia Design Studio at Fishermans Bend was shut down. Holden has been replaced by GM Specialty Vehicles (GMSV), which imports the Chevrolet Silverado and the Chevrolet Corvette.

In 2007, the project company was acquired by Italian engineering and offshore services provider company Saipem and it was decided to rename the rig Scarabeo 9.The rig cost US$750 million to build. It was constructed at the Yantai Raffles Shipyard in Yantai, China. The contract was signed on 5 April 2006, the keel was laid on 1 April 2008, and originally the construction was to be completed in September 2009.  After several delays at the Yantai Raffles shipyard it was shipped to the Keppel FELS shipyard in Singapore for the final completion in 2010.  The reason of delays was related to a number of orders which were carried out simultaneously at the Yantai Raffles shipyard.  Changing shipyards caused additional cost of between US$70 and 100 million.  Beside of the Keppel FELS shipyard also the SembCorp Marine's Jurong Shipyard in Singapore was considered for the completion works.On its way to Singapore, a water leak occurred due to \"water raining into the tanks from the top that was not been drained out.\"  The incident caused an extensive inspection to assure its seaworthiness.  The main part of Keppel's work involved the completion and commissioning of marine and drilling systems on board.The rig was delivered to Saipem on 25 August 2011.  On her maiden voyage to Cuba, Scarabeo 9 was escorted around the Cape of Good Hope by the Fairmount Marine owned tugboat Fairmount Glacier.", "hasanswer": false}]}

During its first few years, it was in direct competition with the Swedish Wikipedia. However, because of the website's popularity and open nature, Susning was highly affected by vandals, eventually leading to the complete shutdown of the project.

The longest section of MD 7 begins at US 40 just east of the city of Baltimore in Rosedale and extends through eastern Baltimore County and southern Harford County to US 40 in Aberdeen. The next segment of the state highway is a C-shaped route through Havre de Grace on the west bank of the Susquehanna River. The third mainline section of MD 7 begins in Perryville on the east bank of the Susquehanna River and ends at US 40 a short distance west of the start of the fourth section, which passes through Charlestown and North East before ending at US 40, just west of Elkton. The fifth segment of the highway begins at South Street and passes through the eastern part of Elkton before reconnecting with US 40 east of Elkton and west of the Delaware state line.\nMD 7 is the old alignment of US 40 in northeastern Maryland. The route was first laid out early in colonial times and later formed part of the post road between Baltimore and Philadelphia (going further north to New York City and into New England to Boston) and between the northern and southern of the original Thirteen Colonies on the East Coast. The highway in Baltimore and Harford counties became a turnpike, constructed and operated  by a private stockholder company in the early 19th century. The Maryland State Roads Commission (established 1908 - now the Maryland State Highway Administration  within the Maryland Department of Transportation since the early 1970s) marked portions of what became known as the Philadelphia Road, close to Baltimore and between Perryville and Elkton for improvement as state roads in 1909. Those sections and the highway between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace were constructed as modern roads in the early to mid-1910s. The remainder of the highway was constructed in the 1920s and designated as US 40 in 1927. The high volume of traffic and the required continuous expansion of the highway led the old Maryland State Roads Commission to construct the modern Pulaski Highway (named for the foreign  military volunteer of a Polish cavalry officer  Casimir Pulaski (1745-1779), who fought in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), which was constructed during the \"Great Depression\" years between 1935 and 1941.

During World War II it manufactured Synthonia, a synthetic ammonia for explosives. The Wilton R&D site was built to support the plastics division with R&D and chemical engineering facilities. The ICI Billingham Division was split into the ICI Heavy Organic Chemicals Division and ICI Agricultural Division in the 1960s. From 1971 to 1988 ICI Physics and Radioisotopes Section (later known as Tracerco) operated a small General Atomics TRIGA Mark I nuclear reactor at its Billingham factory for the production of radioisotopes used in the manufacture of flow and level instruments, among other products. The Agricultural Division was noted for the development of the world's largest bioreactor at the time \u2013 the 1.5 million litre Pruteen Reactor, used for the cultivation of animal feed. Engineering models of components and the builder's model of the complete plant are now in the collection of the Science Museum London. Pruteen had limited economic success but was followed by the much more successful development of Quorn.\nBlackley (in Manchester) and Huddersfield: ICI used the sites to manufacture dyestuffs. The dye business, known as the ICI Dyestuffs Division in the 1960s, went through several reorganisations. Huddersfield was tied in with Wilton with the production of nitrobenzene and nitrotoluene. Huddersfield also produced insecticides. (Syngenta still manufacture insecticides at Huddersfield). Proxel Biocide was made at Huddersfield from the 80s onwards. Additives also made at Huddersield.  Huddersfield became Zeneca then AstraZeneca, in 2004 Huddersfield was Syngenta, Avecia, Arch and Lubrizol running what were all ICI plants at one time.    Through the years it was combined with other speciality chemicals businesses and became Organics Division. Then became ICI Colours and Fine Chemicals and then ICI Specialties.\nRuncorn (in Cheshire): ICI operated a number of separate sites within the Runcorn area, including the Castner-Kellner site, where ICI manufactured chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda). Adjacent to the Castner-Kellner site was Rocksavage works, where a variety of chemicals based on chlorine products were manufactured, including Chloromethanes, Arklone dry cleaning fluid, Trichloethylene degreasing fluid and the Arcton range of CFCs. Also on that site were PVC manufacture and HF (Hydrogen fluoride) manufacture. At Runcorn Heath Research Laboratories, technical support, research and development for Mond Division products was carried out, and the support sections included chemical plan design and engineering sections.  Just to the north of Runcorn, on an island between the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Mersey could be found the Wigg Works, which had been erected originally for producing poison gas in wartime. In Widnes could also be found several factories producing weedkillers and other products. For many years it was known as ICI Mond Division but later became part of the ICI Chemicals and Polymers Division. The Runcorn site was also responsible for the development of the HiGEE and Spinning Disc Reactor concepts. These were originated by Professor Colin Ramshaw and led to the concept of Process Intensification; research into these novel technologies is now being pursued by the Process Intensification Group at Newcastle University.\nWinnington and Wallerscote (in Northwich, Cheshire): It was here that ICI manufactured sodium carbonate (soda ash) and its various by-products such as sodium bicarbonate (bicarbonate of soda), and sodium sesquicarbonate. The Winnington site, built in 1873 by the entrepreneurs John Tomlinson Brunner and Ludwig Mond, was also the base for the former company Brunner, Mond & Co. Ltd. and, after the merger which created ICI, the powerful and influential Alkali Division. It was at the laboratories on this site that polythene was discovered by accident in 1933 during experiments into high pressure reactions. Wallerscote was built in 1926, its construction delayed by the First World War, and became one of the largest factories devoted to a single product (soda ash) in the world. However, the decreasing importance of the soda ash trade to ICI in favour of newer products such as paints and plastics, meant that in 1984 the Wallerscote site was closed, and thereafter mostly demolished. The laboratory where polythene was discovered was sold off and the building became home to a variety of businesses including a go-kart track and paintballing, and the Winnington Works were divested to the newly formed company, Brunner Mond, in 1991. It was again sold in 2006, to Tata (an Indian-based company) and in 2011 was re branded as Tata Chemicals Europe.

During World War II it manufactured Synthonia, a synthetic ammonia for explosives. The Wilton R&D site was built to support the plastics division with R&D and chemical engineering facilities. The ICI Billingham Division was split into the ICI Heavy Organic Chemicals Division and ICI Agricultural Division in the 1960s. From 1971 to 1988 ICI Physics and Radioisotopes Section (later known as Tracerco) operated a small General Atomics TRIGA Mark I nuclear reactor at its Billingham factory for the production of radioisotopes used in the manufacture of flow and level instruments, among other products. The Agricultural Division was noted for the development of the world's largest bioreactor at the time \u2013 the 1.5 million litre Pruteen Reactor, used for the cultivation of animal feed. Engineering models of components and the builder's model of the complete plant are now in the collection of the Science Museum London. Pruteen had limited economic success but was followed by the much more successful development of Quorn.\nBlackley (in Manchester) and Huddersfield: ICI used the sites to manufacture dyestuffs. The dye business, known as the ICI Dyestuffs Division in the 1960s, went through several reorganisations. Huddersfield was tied in with Wilton with the production of nitrobenzene and nitrotoluene. Huddersfield also produced insecticides. (Syngenta still manufacture insecticides at Huddersfield). Proxel Biocide was made at Huddersfield from the 80s onwards. Additives also made at Huddersield.  Huddersfield became Zeneca then AstraZeneca, in 2004 Huddersfield was Syngenta, Avecia, Arch and Lubrizol running what were all ICI plants at one time.    Through the years it was combined with other speciality chemicals businesses and became Organics Division. Then became ICI Colours and Fine Chemicals and then ICI Specialties.\nRuncorn (in Cheshire): ICI operated a number of separate sites within the Runcorn area, including the Castner-Kellner site, where ICI manufactured chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda). Adjacent to the Castner-Kellner site was Rocksavage works, where a variety of chemicals based on chlorine products were manufactured, including Chloromethanes, Arklone dry cleaning fluid, Trichloethylene degreasing fluid and the Arcton range of CFCs. Also on that site were PVC manufacture and HF (Hydrogen fluoride) manufacture. At Runcorn Heath Research Laboratories, technical support, research and development for Mond Division products was carried out, and the support sections included chemical plan design and engineering sections.  Just to the north of Runcorn, on an island between the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Mersey could be found the Wigg Works, which had been erected originally for producing poison gas in wartime. In Widnes could also be found several factories producing weedkillers and other products. For many years it was known as ICI Mond Division but later became part of the ICI Chemicals and Polymers Division. The Runcorn site was also responsible for the development of the HiGEE and Spinning Disc Reactor concepts. These were originated by Professor Colin Ramshaw and led to the concept of Process Intensification; research into these novel technologies is now being pursued by the Process Intensification Group at Newcastle University.\nWinnington and Wallerscote (in Northwich, Cheshire): It was here that ICI manufactured sodium carbonate (soda ash) and its various by-products such as sodium bicarbonate (bicarbonate of soda), and sodium sesquicarbonate. The Winnington site, built in 1873 by the entrepreneurs John Tomlinson Brunner and Ludwig Mond, was also the base for the former company Brunner, Mond & Co. Ltd. and, after the merger which created ICI, the powerful and influential Alkali Division. It was at the laboratories on this site that polythene was discovered by accident in 1933 during experiments into high pressure reactions. Wallerscote was built in 1926, its construction delayed by the First World War, and became one of the largest factories devoted to a single product (soda ash) in the world. However, the decreasing importance of the soda ash trade to ICI in favour of newer products such as paints and plastics, meant that in 1984 the Wallerscote site was closed, and thereafter mostly demolished. The laboratory where polythene was discovered was sold off and the building became home to a variety of businesses including a go-kart track and paintballing, and the Winnington Works were divested to the newly formed company, Brunner Mond, in 1991.

The ground has also staged rugby union, with four Scotland international fixtures being held there including a match against the Barbarians. In club football, Inverness Caledonian Thistle temporarily shared Pittodrie during part of the 2004\u201305 season.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_44920", "text": "The original Aberdeen football club was formed in 1881. They played at various venues within the city, until a former dung hill for police horses was cleared and readied for football in 1899. The land was leased from Mr Knight Erskine of Pittodrie, with an agreement to construct a terrace on what is now the site of the Richard Donald Stand. The first game, a 7\u20131 win over Dumbarton, was played on 2 September 1899. The club was merged on 18 April 1903 with two other local clubs, Victoria United and Orion, to form Aberdeen FC. 8000 spectators turned up to watch the new Aberdeen FC play its first game at Pittodrie, a 1\u20131 draw in the Northern League against Stenhousemuir on 15 August 1903. The club joined the Scottish Football League in 1904.Increasing popularity of the team and rising attendances led to major developments at Pittodrie in the 1920s. The club purchased the ground, which they had been leasing, with the final payment made on 1 December 1920. The Main Stand, where the club offices, dressing rooms and trophy room are located, was constructed in 1925. This was partly funded by the sale of Alex Jackson to Huddersfield Town. Also in the 1920s, the dugout was introduced to football by Aberdeen coach Donald Colman, who was interested in sitting lower to the pitch in order to inspect the players' footwork.\nThe club won its first major trophy in 1947, when it won the Scottish Cup. With increased success came more additions to Pittodrie. The record attendance occurred on 13 March 1954, when 45,061 spectators turned up for a Scottish Cup match against Hearts. Floodlights were introduced at Pittodrie on 21 October 1959, when English league side Luton Town were beaten 3\u20132 in a friendly. By 1 August 1968, the Main Stand had become all-seated as part of a \u00a3100,000 improvement of the ground. This coincided with a change of name from Pittodrie Park to Pittodrie Stadium. On 6 February 1971, a fire destroyed part of the Main Stand, and gutted the dressing rooms and club offices. The Scottish Cup trophy, which was held by Aberdeen at the time, had to be rescued by firemen.\nIn 1978, Pittodrie became the first all-seated stadium in Great Britain, after the south terracing was fitted with bench style seating. This improvement pre-dated the Taylor Report on British football grounds by a decade and coincided with a distinct upturn in the fortunes of the home team, now managed by Alex Ferguson. The south side became the South Stand in 1980, following the installation of a cantilever roof which covered most of the seats. A year later, the benches were replaced by individual seats.Both during the subsequent run in the 1980s and at numerous other times over the century the stadium has been in operation, there have been many memorable nights for the local fans. However, Pittodrie's greatest night is generally regarded as 16 March 1983. Aberdeen fought back from 2\u20131 down in a European Cup Winners' Cup quarter-final second leg tie against Bayern Munich to win 3\u20132. A full house witnessed this victory, which took the Dons through to the semi-finals, and they went on to win the trophy by defeating Real Madrid in the final. The club installed 24 executive boxes in the Main Stand, and built a new roof over the Merkland Road End in 1985. Undersoil heating was installed in 1987.\nThe most recent development of the stadium came in the 1992\u201393 season when the Beach End stand on the east side of the ground was demolished, with the new Richard Donald stand - named after the club's long serving chairman - constructed in its place. On 1 August 1993, the new stand was opened with a League Cup tie against Clydebank. The official opening was carried out later in 1993 by Princess Anne. It is currently the only two tier stand in the stadium. The stadium has remained relatively unchanged since then, although some minor improvements, such as the introduction of an electronic stadium entry system for the 2006\u201307 season, have been carried out.\nThe site of the stadium is only 550 yards away from the North Sea, and with only the King's Links golf course between the stadium and the beach, the ground is one of the coldest football grounds in Britain.\nAs a result of a ground sharing agreement, Pittodrie was used by Inverness Caledonian Thistle for their home matches during the early part of the 2004\u201305 season. This was required because Inverness CT's own Caledonian Stadium did not meet the requirements for entry into the Scottish Premier League until improvements were carried out and the seating capacity increased. In 2005 the stadium size criterion for entry to the SPL was reduced to 6,000, thereby allowing Inverness Caledonian Thistle to return to their home stadium partway during the season.\nIn March 2020 the club announced plans to reduce the operational capacity of Pittodrie to 15,500. Despite this, attendances in the 2023-24 season have been reported from 15,000 to 18,652.https://www.footballwebpages.co.uk/aberdeen/attendances", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_44921", "text": "The Main Stand was the original grandstand within the ground, and contains much of the staff and offices responsible for the day-to-day running of the stadium, from the boot room to the trophy room. Teams enter the pitch from a tunnel to the extreme left of this stand. As befits a main stand, this section of the ground includes both padded seating for club officials and VIPs, and several executive boxes at the rear. There are a number of pillars running along this stand, supporting the roof. As a consequence, views in some places are restricted. It remains, however, the most expensive stand from which to watch matches. To the east of the Main Stand is the club shop, which doubles as a ticket office.\nThe Richard Donald Stand is named after former club chairman Dick Donald. Completed in 1993, it houses over 6,000 fans, although this is a reduction on its Beach End predecessor. It is a cantilever construction with two tiers and a row of twelve executive boxes in between. It is commonly referred to as simply the \"RDS\". It was built by the present chairman's construction firm, the Stewart Milne Group, at a cost of \u00a34.5 million. Within this stand are a number of banqueting rooms, which are used for corporate hospitality and outside bookings.\nTaking its name from the street behind it, the Merkland Stand (also known as 'the Paddock' or 'King Street End') sits behind the goal, on the west of the ground.

They played at various venues within the city, until a former dung hill for police horses was cleared and readied for football in 1899. The land was leased from Mr Knight Erskine of Pittodrie, with an agreement to construct a terrace on what is now the site of the Richard Donald Stand. The first game, a 7\u20131 win over Dumbarton, was played on 2 September 1899. The club was merged on 18 April 1903 with two other local clubs, Victoria United and Orion, to form Aberdeen FC. 8000 spectators turned up to watch the new Aberdeen FC play its first game at Pittodrie, a 1\u20131 draw in the Northern League against Stenhousemuir on 15 August 1903. The club joined the Scottish Football League in 1904.Increasing popularity of the team and rising attendances led to major developments at Pittodrie in the 1920s. The club purchased the ground, which they had been leasing, with the final payment made on 1 December 1920. The Main Stand, where the club offices, dressing rooms and trophy room are located, was constructed in 1925. This was partly funded by the sale of Alex Jackson to Huddersfield Town. Also in the 1920s, the dugout was introduced to football by Aberdeen coach Donald Colman, who was interested in sitting lower to the pitch in order to inspect the players' footwork.\nThe club won its first major trophy in 1947, when it won the Scottish Cup. With increased success came more additions to Pittodrie. The record attendance occurred on 13 March 1954, when 45,061 spectators turned up for a Scottish Cup match against Hearts. Floodlights were introduced at Pittodrie on 21 October 1959, when English league side Luton Town were beaten 3\u20132 in a friendly. By 1 August 1968, the Main Stand had become all-seated as part of a \u00a3100,000 improvement of the ground. This coincided with a change of name from Pittodrie Park to Pittodrie Stadium. On 6 February 1971, a fire destroyed part of the Main Stand, and gutted the dressing rooms and club offices. The Scottish Cup trophy, which was held by Aberdeen at the time, had to be rescued by firemen.\nIn 1978, Pittodrie became the first all-seated stadium in Great Britain, after the south terracing was fitted with bench style seating. This improvement pre-dated the Taylor Report on British football grounds by a decade and coincided with a distinct upturn in the fortunes of the home team, now managed by Alex Ferguson. The south side became the South Stand in 1980, following the installation of a cantilever roof which covered most of the seats. A year later, the benches were replaced by individual seats.Both during the subsequent run in the 1980s and at numerous other times over the century the stadium has been in operation, there have been many memorable nights for the local fans. However, Pittodrie's greatest night is generally regarded as 16 March 1983. Aberdeen fought back from 2\u20131 down in a European Cup Winners' Cup quarter-final second leg tie against Bayern Munich to win 3\u20132. A full house witnessed this victory, which took the Dons through to the semi-finals, and they went on to win the trophy by defeating Real Madrid in the final. The club installed 24 executive boxes in the Main Stand, and built a new roof over the Merkland Road End in 1985. Undersoil heating was installed in 1987.\nThe most recent development of the stadium came in the 1992\u201393 season when the Beach End stand on the east side of the ground was demolished, with the new Richard Donald stand - named after the club's long serving chairman - constructed in its place. On 1 August 1993, the new stand was opened with a League Cup tie against Clydebank. The official opening was carried out later in 1993 by Princess Anne. It is currently the only two tier stand in the stadium. The stadium has remained relatively unchanged since then, although some minor improvements, such as the introduction of an electronic stadium entry system for the 2006\u201307 season, have been carried out.\nThe site of the stadium is only 550 yards away from the North Sea, and with only the King's Links golf course between the stadium and the beach, the ground is one of the coldest football grounds in Britain.\nAs a result of a ground sharing agreement, Pittodrie was used by Inverness Caledonian Thistle for their home matches during the early part of the 2004\u201305 season. This was required because Inverness CT's own Caledonian Stadium did not meet the requirements for entry into the Scottish Premier League until improvements were carried out and the seating capacity increased. In 2005 the stadium size criterion for entry to the SPL was reduced to 6,000, thereby allowing Inverness Caledonian Thistle to return to their home stadium partway during the season.\nIn March 2020 the club announced plans to reduce the operational capacity of Pittodrie to 15,500. Despite this, attendances in the 2023-24 season have been reported from 15,000 to 18,652.https://www.footballwebpages.co.uk/aberdeen/attendances", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_44921", "text": "The Main Stand was the original grandstand within the ground, and contains much of the staff and offices responsible for the day-to-day running of the stadium, from the boot room to the trophy room.

Its address is 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850.The building was completed in 1977 with a total of 929,857 square feet (86,386.5 m2) of working space.\nIt houses the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, the United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Honolulu Division), the offices of Hawaii's U.S. Senators, the offices of Hawaii's U.S. Representatives for Hawaii's 1st congressional district and Hawaii's 2nd congressional district, and branch offices of the United States Secret Service, United States Probation and Pretrial Services System, Department of Homeland Security, United States Department of Justice, Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, among other entities.The building was named after Prince Jonah K\u016bhi\u014d Kalaniana\u02bbole, heir to the throne of the overthrown Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi, who served as Republican territorial delegate to the United States Congress from 1903 through 1922.\nIt was built on part of the former US Army Fort Armstrong, which was named for Samuel C. Armstrong (1839\u20131893), son of Hawaiian missionaries.\nAcross Ala Moana Boulevard is the Aloha Tower at the Honolulu harbor. Other parts of Fort Armstrong became a container terminal for military supplies.The Prince K\u016bhi\u014d Building was constructed to replace the aging Federal Court, Customs House and Post Office building fronting \u02bbIolani Palace and adjacent to Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale which had been built in 1922 and expanded in 1931.

The General Services Administration wanted a simple tall office tower, while local architects argued for a building more appropriate to Hawaii.\nStatutes provided that all buildings between the shoreline and the foot of Punchbowl Crater could not be taller than the Hawai\u02bbi State Capitol. The federal government, not legally limited by local statutes, defied the statutes and constructed the building as the tallest structure in the path of the capitol building's view of the shoreline. The complex includes ten stories of offices (including a penthouse level), connected by an enclosed bridge to a six-story courthouse building (including basement).The Prince K\u016bhi\u014d Federal Building was designed by Joseph G.F. Farrell's firm Architects Hawaii. Other government buildings designed by the firm include the capitol building of Palau, which opened in 2006.\nThe building was selected for $121 million of renovations as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The plan is to make the building more efficient by upgrading its mechanical, electrical, fire-safety, and plumbing systems.\nIt had already been cited as an efficient building by the Energy Star program.\nTraces of asbestos were discovered during the first phase.\nThe second phase of construction was approved in March 2011.", "hasanswer": true}]}

With the arrival of Lord Kylsant at the head of the company, the planned size of the project increased, until it became that of a large ship destined to be the first to exceed the symbolic limit of 1,000 feet (305 m) in length and 30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph) in speed.\nAfter several years of study, the construction began in June 1928 in the Harland & Wolff shipyards in Belfast. However, the work was carried out at a slow pace and ceased in June 1929, probably because further studies relating to the propulsion were needed. The Great Depression which began the same year and the financial affair which sent Lord Kylsant to prison in 1931 put a definitive end to the construction, for which the government refused to advance funds.\nWithin the White Star Line fleet, the planned Oceanic was replaced by two smaller ships, MV Britannic and MV Georgic.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_45073", "text": "By the early 1910s, the White Star Line had planned to provide regular and cost-effective transatlantic service with its three Olympic-class ships. The loss of Titanic in 1912, then of Britannic in 1916, however, seriously handicapped this aim. Following World War I, the company was given two German liners in compensation for wartime damage, which became RMS Majestic and RMS Homeric. Both were assigned to the transatlantic service alongside RMS Olympic, the only surviving ship of the initially planned trio. It quickly turned out, however, that while Majestic and Olympic had relatively equivalent profiles, reaching roughly the same speed (between 22 and 24 knots, 41 and 44 km/h, 25 and 28 mph respectively) and the same passenger capacities, Homeric was significantly smaller and slower (19 knots, 35 km/h, 22 mph only). Additionally, the ship was less successful compared to its fellow liners. In fact, its career did not last long and it left the North Atlantic route in 1932, only ten years after its entry into service.It was in August 1926 that a press release about a project from the company appeared for the first time, indicating the imminent construction of a 25-knot ship to replace Homeric. This ship must then, according to the press releases, be of a profile close to that of the Olympic-class vessels. The same year, in November, the International Mercantile Marine Co., a trust that owned the White Star Line, decided to separate from its non-American companies. The company was then bought by Owen Philipps, 1st Baron Kylsant, who integrated it into his company, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, the largest maritime conglomerate of the period. Lord Kylsant, who was also the owner of the Harland & Wolff shipyards in Belfast, decided to have the planned ship built there, for which studies were carried out over many months.\n\nOn 14 April 1927, construction of a fleetmate Britannic began in Harland & Wolff. Britannic was a smaller version of the proposed liner, but of similar design. However, it was not until 18 June 1928 that a contract was signed to build the proposed liner, construction began ten days later. The liner was to be named Oceanic, in reference to the very first liner put into service by the company after its purchase by Thomas Henry Ismay in 1871. Estimates gave it a length of over 300 metres (984 ft), 60,000 gross register tons (GRT), and a cost of \u00a33.5 million, making it the largest liner ever built and the first to exceed the symbolic 1,000-foot mark. Construction of the ship's keel began with great fanfare ten days after the contract was signed. The only existing plans of the ship remained sketchy and only allowed for understanding the general arrangement, but they did give an idea of the capacity of the liner: it would carry 722 passengers in first class, 464 in second, and 1,096 in third, and also 240 interchangeable seats between first and second class, and 286 between second and third, for a total of 2,808 passengers.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_45074", "text": "However, construction was proceeding at a very slow pace, to such an extent that a year later, the keel was still not completed. The work was slowed by a dispute over her powerplant; Lord Kylsant wanted to use diesel-electric instead of the then more common steam power to enable the ship's speed to exceed 30 knots (a barrier not surpassed until the completion of SS Normandie in 1935). White Star proposed having over 40 diesel generator sets driving four propellers through geared electric motors. Harland and Wolff was reluctant to adopt this system, preferring to continue the use of trusted steam turbine propulsion as it seemed that not testing a new type of engine by installing it on smaller ships first was perilous. A compromise of sorts was reached and the final design used four conventional low-speed 'cathedral' diesel engines, each directly driving one propeller shaft - which would have made Oceanic the first quadruple-screw motor ship. Despite construction on Oceanic slowing down, construction of the smaller Britannic continued without issues.\nFurther work on Oceanic was postponed after which the keel was coated in preservative oil in hopes construction would resume but the project was later cancelled due to the Great Depression and the collapse of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, owners of the White Star Line, as a result of the financial problems of Sir Owen Philips, Lord Kylsant. The Royal Mail Case, as it was known, led to the imprisonment of Kylsant, and to substantial changes in accounting and auditing practice.  Loans backed by the governments of England and Northern Ireland intended for the construction of Oceanic were diverted to complete the construction of Britannic, as well as to start construction of a sister ship to Britannic named Georgic.

However, it was not until 18 June 1928 that a contract was signed to build the proposed liner, construction began ten days later. The liner was to be named Oceanic, in reference to the very first liner put into service by the company after its purchase by Thomas Henry Ismay in 1871. Estimates gave it a length of over 300 metres (984 ft), 60,000 gross register tons (GRT), and a cost of \u00a33.5 million, making it the largest liner ever built and the first to exceed the symbolic 1,000-foot mark. Construction of the ship's keel began with great fanfare ten days after the contract was signed. The only existing plans of the ship remained sketchy and only allowed for understanding the general arrangement, but they did give an idea of the capacity of the liner: it would carry 722 passengers in first class, 464 in second, and 1,096 in third, and also 240 interchangeable seats between first and second class, and 286 between second and third, for a total of 2,808 passengers.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_45074", "text": "However, construction was proceeding at a very slow pace, to such an extent that a year later, the keel was still not completed. The work was slowed by a dispute over her powerplant; Lord Kylsant wanted to use diesel-electric instead of the then more common steam power to enable the ship's speed to exceed 30 knots (a barrier not surpassed until the completion of SS Normandie in 1935). White Star proposed having over 40 diesel generator sets driving four propellers through geared electric motors. Harland and Wolff was reluctant to adopt this system, preferring to continue the use of trusted steam turbine propulsion as it seemed that not testing a new type of engine by installing it on smaller ships first was perilous. A compromise of sorts was reached and the final design used four conventional low-speed 'cathedral' diesel engines, each directly driving one propeller shaft - which would have made Oceanic the first quadruple-screw motor ship. Despite construction on Oceanic slowing down, construction of the smaller Britannic continued without issues.\nFurther work on Oceanic was postponed after which the keel was coated in preservative oil in hopes construction would resume but the project was later cancelled due to the Great Depression and the collapse of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, owners of the White Star Line, as a result of the financial problems of Sir Owen Philips, Lord Kylsant. The Royal Mail Case, as it was known, led to the imprisonment of Kylsant, and to substantial changes in accounting and auditing practice.  Loans backed by the governments of England and Northern Ireland intended for the construction of Oceanic were diverted to complete the construction of Britannic, as well as to start construction of a sister ship to Britannic named Georgic. These two liners were partially built with steel plates ordered for Oceanic, whose partially built hull was subsequently dismantled and reused on Britannic and Georgic after the aforementioned diversion of funds.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It serves as the publishing business for its parent company, Activision Blizzard, and consists of several subsidiary studios. Activision is one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in 2016.The company was founded as Activision, Inc. on October 1, 1979, in Sunnyvale, California, by former Atari game developers upset at their treatment by Atari in order to develop their own games for the popular Atari 2600 home video game console. Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer. The video game crash of 1983, in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the experience of Activision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games and forced the company to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of Infocom. After a management shift, with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis, the company renamed itself to Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications. Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around US$500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991.\nKotick drastically revamped and restructured the company to get it out of debt: dismissing most of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to the Activision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from its former financial troubles, started acquiring numerous studios and various types of intellectual property over the 1990s and 2000s, among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series. A holding company was formed as Activision's parent company to manage both its internal and acquired studios. In 2008, this holding company merged with Vivendi Games (the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment) and formed Activision Blizzard, with Kotick as its CEO. Within this structure, Activision manages numerous third-party studios and publishes all games besides those created by Blizzard.

Both ballparks were primarily constructed of wood.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_45095", "text": "The initial stadium was the club's home beginning in 1885, succeeding Lakefront Park. Although the park's useful life turned out to be as short as the ball club's stay at the Lakefront (seven years), it was also memorable, as the team won back-to-back National League pennants in its first two seasons there.\nThe park was located on a small block bounded by Congress (north, left field), Loomis (east, center field), Harrison (south, right field) and Throop (west, home plate) Streets. The elongated shape of the block lent a bathtub-like shape to the park, with foul lines reportedly as short as 210 feet (64 m). The stadium held roughly 10,000 fans. In addition to the diamond, the park held a bicycle track which encircled the playing field, at the height of the contemporary bicycle craze.\nThe lumber from the stands at the lakefront ballpark was disassembled and reconfigured as the new stands at West Side Park.The Cubs (then known as the White Stockings) had had to secure a new property after 1884, and it took longer than anticipated. The season began on April 30, a month later than it does today, for a 112-game schedule, 50 fewer games than today's major-league schedule. The club spent the first five-plus weeks of the 1885 season on the road, and the park was finally opened on June 6 with a victory over the St. Louis Maroons, late of the Union Association. Despite being \"wanderers\" early in the season, the powerful Chicago club, under player-manager Cap Anson, came home with an 18\u20136 record. They would sweep a four-game set in their first homestand and romp through the league schedule, finishing at 87\u201325. The only team that gave them any problem was the New York Giants, who won 10 of the clubs' 16 meetings and finished just two games behind Chicago in the standings. If projected to a modern 162-game schedule, that translates to 125 and 123 wins, respectively, in a very lopsided league (the third-place club finished 30 games back).\n\nChicago captured the National League pennant that season and also went on to win the league crown in 1886. The site saw postseason action those two years, as the White Stockings squared off in 19th-century World Series play against the St. Louis Cardinals, then playing in the rival American Association and known as the St. Louis Browns. The championships of the 1880s were disorganized in comparison to the modern World Series, exemplified by the 1885 contest, which ended in dispute with no clear winner. The 1886 World Series was more conventional, and was won by the Browns. Those matchups were the first on-field confrontations of the Cubs and Cardinals clubs, which remains one of baseball's strongest rivalries today.\nThe site also saw \"bonus baseball\" in 1887, as a neutral site for Game 14 of that year's unique 15-game \"traveling\" World Series between the Browns and the Detroit Wolverines. In 1891 the team split its schedule between West Side Park and South Side Park (II).  The first West Side Park was abandoned after the 1891 season, with the team playing at home exclusively on the South Side in 1892.\nThe site of the first West Side Park is now occupied by the Andrew Jackson Language Academy, whose address is 1340 West Harrison.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_45096", "text": "In May 1893, the club opened the second West Side Park a few blocks west-southwest of the first one, on a larger block bounded by Taylor, Wood, Polk and Lincoln (now Wolcott) Streets. It was located at 41\u00b052\u203213\u2033N 87\u00b040\u203221\u2033W. During May and June, they split their 1893 schedule with South Side Park, playing Sunday games on the West Side and weekday games on the South Side. By mid-summer they had abandoned the South Side park and moved into the West Side park full-time.\nHome plate for this ballpark was in the northwest corner of the property, toward the Polk and Lincoln intersection. The right field fence paralleled Taylor, with flat apartments between the alley behind the right field area, and Taylor itself. There were also flats across Wood Street to the east, behind left field, giving the park (for a few years, at least) a degree of the ambiance that Wrigley Field would later be famous for. Cook County Hospital was across the street to the north, behind third base. Like the first West Side ballpark, the new facility was restricted by the streets around it, creating a rectangular playing area.\nThe field layout was reported in the Inter Ocean on April 16, 1893: \"The diamond is 90 feet (27 m) from the grand stand, and the right and left field fences are 340 feet (100 m) from the home plate, 130 feet (40 m) further than the old west side fence. The distance from the home plate to the extreme center field is 560 feet (170 m). The club will play all their Sunday games at the new grounds during the World's Fair, and after the fair is closed will probably play all their games there.\"\nAn artist's conception of the new field includes a rooftop tier of private seating on the grandstand, and roofed bleachers beyond first and third base. Photographs from the early 1900s suggest those plans were left dormant until starting in 1905, when the team began playing well and expansion of the ballpark seating was begun.\nAlthough the 340-560-340 sounds symmetrical, the left field side was much more spacious, and the distance to center was actually very deep left-center, possibly the far corner of the property.\nThe original layout of the park seated about 12,500 patrons. As with other parks of the era, fans were often permitted to stand along the outer perimeter of the playing field itself. When the team began playing winning ball under Frank Chance, overflow crowds became more frequent.\n\nOn August 5, 1894, during its first full season as home to the Cubs (at that point known as the Colts), West Side Park suffered severe damage from fire during a game against the Cincinnati Reds. As the fire spread through the first-base side stands, panicked fans trying to escape pressed up against the barbed wire fence separating them from the playing field. Only quick action by several players in wrenching the fence open averted a major tragedy. The burnt stands were simply roped off, and the season resumed the next day, with the burnt area fenced off, and the spectators sitting on the left side of the diamond. Despite that near-disaster, the club rebuilt the burnt portion out of wood.\nOne highlight, albeit for the visitors, occurred on July 13, 1896, when Philadelphia Phillies outfielder/firstbaseman Ed Delahanty smacked four home runs in one game, only the second player to do so. In contrast to Bobby Lowe's feat two years earlier, which was aided by a short foul line, two of Delahanty's were inside-the-park. After Delahanty's third, center fielder Bill Lange drew a laugh by calling \"time\", stationing himself in deep-deep center, near the clubhouse, seemingly a mile away, and then waving the pitcher to continue. Delahanty then got the laugh on Lange by knocking it between the clubhouse and the fence, again circling the bases while Lange scurried for the ball. The normally partisan home fans cheered Delahanty's effort. Chicago got the last laugh, winning the game, 9\u20138.\n\nAs the park entered the new century, it featured a small covered grandstand behind home plate.  Behind the home plate stands, the team and ticket offices were housed in a fairly ornate two-story brick building topped with statues of baseball players.  Uncovered bleachers extended along both foul lines and into left field.  Beyond left-center field, the bleachers gave way to a small clubhouse.  The right-field bleachers were only nine rows deep, sitting underneath a free-standing billboard that ran above the length of the bleachers. The billboard frequently featured large ads for the sports pages and the sportswriters of local newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Daily News. A scoreboard was located on the extreme right end of the billboard, toward the right field corner.  Much like today at Wrigley Field, several of the rooftops beyond the outfield bleachers offered bleacher seating of their own, at least for a few years.\nThe second West Side Park was the home of the Cubs' most successful teams of the 20th century.  From 1906 through 1910, the Cubs won four National League pennants and two World Series championships.  The 1906 World Series between the Cubs and the Chicago White Sox featured the first cross-town matchup in Series history.  Although the Cubs had one of the most successful seasons in major league history, winning 116 contests against just 36 losses, they were defeated by the light-hitting White Sox four games to two.  The Cubs finally brought a championship to West Side Park the following year when they swept the Detroit Tigers after ending the first contest in a tie.  In 1908, West Side Park became the home of the first repeat world champions when the Cubs again bested the Tigers.  After a one-year absence, the Cubs returned to the Series in 1910, only to lose in five games to the Philadelphia Athletics. The 1908 championship \nturned out to be the franchise's last World Series championship until 2016, ending a staggering 108-year drought for the franchise.\n\nThe ballpark expanded with the club's rising fortunes.  For 1905, several rows of private box seats were built on top of the original grandstand roof behind home plate.  That same year saw the construction of a new two-story brick clubhouse structure, fronted by columns, out in far left-center.  After just two seasons, jury-box bleachers were built directly in front of and over the clubhouse. During the 1908 season, the bleachers along the first and third-base lines were gradually covered and topped by more private box seating.\nBy the early 1910s the wooden ballpark was showing its age, in large part due to neglect by Charles Murphy, the unpopular owner of the Cubs (one of whose alternate, media-driven nicknames was the unflattering \"Murphy's Spuds\"). In 1910, the neighborhood view beyond the nearby right field bleachers was blocked off by an enormous billboard. In 1912, the more distant left field view was similarly obstructed by a large billboard, which also served as the new scoreboard.  The enclosure of the park was completed with the installment of billboards in dead center.  At this time, the jury box bleachers in left-center field were removed, adding to the new claustrophobic feel of the outfield. With gambling becoming an increasing problem in baseball, starting in 1911 the playing field was adorned with large signs (as with some other major league ballparks) reminding both fans and players, \"No Betting Allowed.\" Additionally, the dilapidated park found itself competing unsuccessfully with new steel-and-concrete baseball venues. The Chicago White Sox inaugurated Comiskey Park in 1910. Four years later, the upstart Federal League placed a franchise on the North Side and began play in Weeghman Park. By 1915, the Cubs were the third most popular team in a three-team city.\nWhen the Federal League collapsed after the 1915 season, Charles Weeghman, owner of the now-defunct Chicago Whales, was allowed to buy a substantial interest in the Cubs. One of his first acts was to abandon West Side Park and move the Cubs to Weeghman Park for the 1916 season. Weeghman Park survives today as Wrigley Field.\n\nOne of the few items the Cubs took with them, besides normal operational properties, was a set of large letters comprising a sign that had run across the back of the grandstand and was to be read from the outside of the park: \"Chicago National League Ball Park\". This sign was placed along the top of the Weeghman Park wall bordering Sheffield Avenue, visible to everyone in the park, and of course reading backwards to the spectators. This oddity lasted a few years at Weeghman / Cubs Park until it was brought down during an early remodeling.\nWest Side Park continued to host semipro and amateur baseball events for a few years. It even served as a setting for Buffalo Bill's Wild West, thus converting the entire former ballfield into a different kind of \"bull pen\". The ballpark was torn down in 1920. Murphy, who still owned the property, sold the leftover lumber for scrap. He sold the property itself to the University of Illinois. The site is now occupied by the University of Illinois Medical Center.\nThis West Side Park was the only park that witnessed the Cubs as World Series Champions from 1908 to 2016. The Cubs won back-to-back titles here in 1907 and 1908. In June 1909, a flag-raising ceremony was held, celebrating the Cubs second consecutive World Series.

The shrub garden was added later in 1900\u20131908.\nAfter Lubbock's death (1927), the estate was acquired by an American geologist Charles Watson Boise.  He made various alterations to both house and garden but retained the original character of the gardens.\nIn 1964 Charles Boise bequeathed Emmetts to the National Trust. Since then the trust has sought to maintain the botanical diversity of the garden developed by the two men.\nMany of the old trees and shrubs planted by Lubbock were brought down in the Great Storm of 1987.

Bad debts were transferred to the asset-management company Securum, which sold off the assets. At the time, the approach of establishing \"good\" and \"bad\" banks composed of corresponding assets was a novel resolution approach.\nMerita Group merged with Nordbanken in 1997 forming MeritaNordbanken. The Solo internet-based banking operation of MeritaNordbanken was a global pioneer and leader providing mobile and internet banking access in 1999. The bank reached 1 million internet banking customers during 1999 with 3 million log-ins and 3.7 million payments per month. Housing loans via Solo were introduced in 1999. MeritaNordbanken agreed to buy Unidanmark, Denmark's second-largest bank, in early 2000 creating the Nordic region's biggest financial institution with \u20ac186 billion in assets. The merged group had a banking market share of 20% in Sweden, 25% in Denmark and 40% in Finland and a combined workforce of 28,050. By end 2000, MeritaNordbanken had further merged with Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse of Norway, a process started in 1999 and changed its name to Nordea. Christiania Bank had also been impacted severely during the banking crisis in the early 1990s, with Nordea acquiring the bank from the Norwegian Government Bank Investment Fund with a 35% share.Nordea expanded into Poland, the Baltics and Russia in the early 2000s, with 2% of total revenues from the Poland and Baltics region. Nordea divested its Polish banking operations in 2013, with the sale to PKO Bank Polski for \u20ac694 million but retains a presence in Poland via operations and IT units supporting the Nordic banks. By end 2014, lending in the Baltics was \u20ac8.2 billion and in Russia \u20ac4.5 billion. During the period 2013-2017 exposure to the Russian market was reduced by 63%. In 2016, Luminor was formed by a merger of Nordea's and DNB's operations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania creating the third largest Baltic regional bank with assets of \u20ac15 billion and a market share of 16.4%. Luminor was sold to Blackstone, with Nordea and DNB retaining each initially a 20% share. However, the full divestment was completed in 2019. Exit from the Russian, Baltic and Polish markets were part of Nordea's de-risking strategy, which also included reduced exposures to some sectors (e.g. Shipping, Oil & Offshore and Agriculture in Denmark). Nordea was one of the Nordic banks, including Danske Bank, SEB and Swedbank, allegedly involved in the money laundering scandal, involving ex-Soviet states, that emerged in 2017.Nordea announced plans to move its corporate headquarters from Stockholm, Sweden to Helsinki, Finland in September 2017.

That same year Cabanel was made a professor of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.\nCabanel's combination of sensual and classical imagery appealed to the higher levels of society. Art historian and curator Robert Rosenblum wrote of Cabanel's The Birth of Venus that \"This Venus hovers somewhere between an ancient deity and a modern dream\"; he described \"the ambiguity of her eyes, that seem to be closed but that a close look reveals that she is awake ...

Between Lincoln and Ferry counties, the roadway crosses Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake on the Keller Ferry, operated fare free by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and the Department of Highways (DoH) since 1930.\nSince 1899, at least one segment of the current highway has been in the state highway system. In 1899, the Marble Mount Road was established and later numbered State Road 4 in 1905 and renamed to the Sans Poil-Loomis Road in 1907. In 1915, a branch to the Canadian border was added to the highway, but was removed in 1923. In 1937, the Primary state highways were established and State Road 4 became Primary State Highway 4 (PSH 4), while the former Canadian branch became Secondary State Highway 4A (SSH 4A). Another highway, extending from Lind to Wilbur, became SSH 4B. In 1964, PSH 4 was split into SR 20 and SR 21 while SSH 2A and SSH 2B also became SR 21. In 1983, a road between Lind and Kahlotus became part of SR 21.\nThe Keller Ferry, which travels across the Columbia River at Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake to connect the two segments of SR 21, was originally a private cable ferry operated in the early 1890s. In 1929, the Ferry and Lincoln counties unveiled a new eight-car cable ferry, named the Keller of Seattle, which served the two counties until 1930. The state highway department took over operations of the ferry in 1930 and replaced the vessel with various boats until a permanent ferry, the Martha S., was launched in 1948. The Martha S. would go on to serve until 2013, when it was retired and replaced with the more modern MV Sanpoil.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_45144", "text": "SR 21 originates at an intersection with SR 260, about 0.28 miles (0.45 km) west of the northern terminus of SR 263; both intersections are in the city of Kahlotus, which is located in a narrow valley near several coulees in Franklin County. After leaving Kahlotus as the Lind\u2013Kahlotus Road, the highway turns northeast and later west as it passes over the Sand Hills Coulee four times. Curving due north, the roadway leaves Franklin County to enter Adams County.

They sold their newspaper to Bergens Arbeiderparti, the local affiliation of the Norwegian Labour Party in 1905. However, the Labour Party went through two party splits in the 1920s.

The next year, the Labour Party left Comintern. As a result, the pro-Comintern faction broke away to form the Communist Party. In the city of Bergen, the communists controlled the local Labour Party chapter Bergens Arbeiderparti, and its newspaper Arbeidet. When the social democrats had lost the power struggle, the victorious communists changed the journalism of their newspaper from social democracy to communism in 1922, erased the local news and published long political articles, chasing their readers away from the newspaper.\nThe few remaining Labour activists were left without a newspaper.

Lazio have been Italian champions twice (1974, 2000), and have won the Coppa Italia seven times, the Supercoppa Italiana three times, and both the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Super Cup on one occasion.The club had their first major success in 1958, winning the domestic cup. In 1974, they won their first Serie A title. The 1990s were the most successful period in Lazio's history, with the team reaching the UEFA Cup final in 1998, winning the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 1999, and clinching the Serie A title in 2000.

After a while of wearing a plain white shirt very early on, Lazio reverted to the colours which they wear today. Some seasons Lazio have used a sky blue and white shirt with stripes, but usually it is sky blue with a white trim, with the white shorts and socks. The club's colours have led to their Italian nickname of Biancocelesti.Lazio's traditional club badge and symbol is the eagle, which was chosen by founding member Luigi Bigiarelli. A symbol of the Roman legions and emperor, it was chosen to represent power and victory; it also identifies the club with its origin city. Lazio's use of the symbol has led to two of their nicknames; le Aquile (\"the Eagles\") and Aquilotti (\"Eaglets\").

(spelled as Tri-Star until 1991) is an American film studio and production company that is a member of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, part of the multinational conglomerate Sony. It is a corporate sibling of Sony studio Columbia Pictures.\nTriStar Pictures was established on March 2, 1982, and founded by Victor Kaufman as Nova Pictures. On May 16, 1983, its name was changed to Tri-Star in order to avoid confusion with the PBS series Nova.Originally a joint venture between CBS, Columbia Pictures and HBO, whose individual video units handled video, broadcast, and pay cable rights to its products, the company scored a number of box office hits with modestly-budgeted fare in the 1980s, as well as fortuitous distribution deals with the Producers Sales Organization, Carolco Pictures and the Taft Entertainment Group. It also expanded ambitiously throughout the decade with the acquisition of Loews Theatres and the formation of its own television arm. Among the various hits TriStar scored on its own during the decade were About Last Night, The Muppets Take Manhattan, Real Genius, Nothing in Common, Peggy Sue Got Married, The Principal, Look Who's Talking and Steel Magnolias.\nOn November 15, 1985, CBS dropped out of the joint venture, selling its stake to Columbia Pictures. HBO sold its shares to the same studio in 1986 in order to form HBO Pictures. On December 21, 1987, Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. following The Coca-Cola Company's merger of Tri-Star and Columbia to become \"Columbia/Tri-Star\", of which it owned 80% of its stock. In January 1988, CPE's stocks somewhat fell, and Coca-Cola decreased its shares in CPE to 49%. On April 13, 1988, the name of the company was reverted back to Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. On November 8, 1989, the Sony Corporation of Japan acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment for $3.4 billion. On August 7, 1991, under Sony Pictures Entertainment, the hyphen was officially removed from the name of the studio.\nDuring the 1990s, TriStar operated autonomously from Columbia. Although its products were mostly indistinguishible from that of its sister studio, it soon scored a string of hits at the box office with such films as Sleepless in Seattle, Philadelphia, The Mirror Has Two Faces, Jerry Maguire, As Good as It Gets and Jumanji, and it also scored a major video hit with Danny DeVito's Matilda. However, in 1998, the company fell on hard times following the box office disappointment of an ambitious remake of the Japanese monster film Godzilla, and Sony quickly responded by merging the studio with Columbia to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures Group. The TriStar name was subsequently used by Sony on a very limited basis until 2004, when the company decided to turn the studio into a genre label that specialized in acquisitions. In 2015, Sony formed TriStar Productions as a vehicle for film and television productions.

The price for a car transit was now HK$10.\nIn 1993, an electronic toll collection system was installed.

Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile and the REO Motor Car Company. I-496 runs east\u2013west from I-96/I-69 near the downtown area and north\u2013south along a section that runs concurrently with US Highway 127 (US 127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers.\nConstruction of I-496 started in 1963, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970. Segments of the freeway south of downtown Lansing were built in the location of a historically black neighborhood. This neighborhood was formed based on the segregationist practices of the early 20th century. Community leaders worked for different housing opportunities for the black residents displaced by I-496 rather than fight the freeway. As the trunkline neared completion, competing proposals to name it resulted in two similar, but separate designations applied to I-496. The city originally approved one name in honor of a former mayor. The local historical society proposed that the state name it as a memorial to Olds after the demolition of the Olds Mansion. The city renamed it the Oldsmobile Expressway, the name under which it opened in December 1970.

It was founded by Berry Gordy Jr. as Tamla Records on January 12, 1959, and incorporated as Motown Record Corporation on April 14, 1960. Its name, a portmanteau of motor and town, has become a nickname for Detroit, where the label was originally headquartered.\nMotown played an important role in the racial integration of popular music as an African American-owned label that achieved crossover success. In the 1960s, Motown and its subsidiary labels (including Tamla Motown, the brand used outside the US) were the most of the Motown sound, a style of soul music with a mainstream pop appeal. Motown was the most successful soul music label, with a net worth of $61 million. During the 1960s, Motown achieved 79 records in the top-ten of the Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 1969.\nFollowing the events of the Detroit Riots of 1967, and the loss of key songwriting/production team Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland that year over pay disputes, Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles, California. Motown expanded into film and television production.\nIt was an independent company until MCA Records bought it in 1988. PolyGram purchased the label from MCA in 1993, followed by MCA successor Universal Music Group, which acquired PolyGram in 1999.Motown spent much of the 2000s headquartered in New York City as a part of the UMG subsidiaries Universal Motown and Universal Motown Republic Group. From 2011 to 2014, it was a part of The Island Def Jam Music Group division of Universal Music. In 2014, however, UMG announced the dissolution of Island Def Jam, and Motown relocated back to Los Angeles to operate under the Capitol Music Group, now operating out of the Capitol Tower. In 2018, Motown was inducted into Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in a ceremony held at the Charles H. Wright Museum.In 2021, Motown separated from the Capitol Music Group to become a standalone label once again.On November 29, 2022, Ethiopia Habtemariam announced that she would be stepping down as chairwoman/CEO of Motown.As of 2023, the label has many acts signed such as City Girls, Diddy, Migos, Lil Baby, Lil Yachty, Smino, Vince Staples, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, and several other artists in the hip-hop and R&B genres.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_45404", "text": "See also: List of Motown artists", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_45405", "text": "Motown specialized in a type of soul music it referred to with the trademark \"The Motown sound\". Crafted with an ear towards pop appeal, the Motown sound typically used tambourines to accent the back beat, prominent and often melodic electric bass-guitar lines, distinctive melodic and chord structures, and a call-and-response singing style that originated in gospel music. In 1971, Jon Landau wrote in Rolling Stone that the sound consisted of songs with simple structures but sophisticated melodies, along with a four-beat drum pattern, regular use of horns and strings, and \"a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio\". Pop production techniques such as the use of orchestral string sections, charted horn sections, and carefully arranged background vocals were also used. Complex arrangements and elaborate, melismatic vocal riffs were avoided. Motown producers believed steadfastly in the \"KISS principle\" (keep it simple, stupid).The Motown production process has been described as factory-like. The Hitsville studios remained open and active 22 hours a day, and artists would often go on tour for weeks, come back to Detroit to record as many songs as possible, and then promptly go on tour again. Berry Gordy held quality control meetings every Friday morning, and used veto power to ensure that only the very best material and performances would be released. The test was that every new release needed to fit into a sequence of the top five selling pop singles of the week. Several tracks that later became critical and commercial favorites were initially rejected by Gordy, the two most notable being the Marvin Gaye songs \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" and \"What's Going On\". In several cases, producers would rework tracks in hopes of eventually getting them approved at a later Friday morning meeting, as producer Norman Whitfield did with \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" and the Temptations' \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\".\nMany of Motown's best-known songs, including all the early hits for the Supremes, were written by the songwriting trio of Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland (Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland). Other important Motown producers and songwriters included Norman Whitfield, William \"Mickey\" Stevenson, Smokey Robinson, Barrett Strong, Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson, Frank Wilson, Pamela Sawyer & Gloria Jones, James Dean & William Weatherspoon, Johnny Bristol, Harvey Fuqua, Gil Askey, Stevie Wonder, and Gordy himself.\nThe style created by the Motown musicians was a major influence on several non-Motown artists of the mid-1960s, such as Dusty Springfield and the Foundations. In the United Kingdom, the Motown sound became the basis of the northern soul movement. Smokey Robinson said the Motown sound had little to do with Detroit:\n\nPeople would listen to it, and they'd say, 'Aha, they use more bass. Or they use more drums.' Bullshit. When we were first successful with it, people were coming from Germany, France, Italy, Mobile, Alabama. From New York, Chicago, California. From everywhere. Just to record in Detroit. They figured it was in the air, that if they came to Detroit and recorded on the freeway, they'd get the Motown sound. Listen, the Motown sound to me is not an audible sound.

It is part of the Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum Complex, with the adjacent Oakland Arena, near Interstate 880. In 2017, the playing surface was dedicated as Rickey Henderson Field in honor of Major League Baseball Hall of Famer and former Athletics left fielder Rickey Henderson.It has been the home of the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball since 1968. It was also the home of the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League from 1966 until 1981, when the team moved to Los Angeles, and again from 1995 until 2019, when the team moved to Las Vegas. Since then, the stadium has been primarily used for baseball. It was the last remaining stadium in the United States shared by professional baseball and football teams. It has also occasionally been used for soccer, including hosting selected San Jose Earthquakes matches in 2008 and 2009, and during the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.The Coliseum has a seating capacity of up to 63,132 depending on its configuration; an upper deck dubbed \"Mount Davis\" by fans was added as part of a 1996 renovation for the Raiders' return to Oakland. In 2006, citing a desire to provide a more \"intimate\" environment, the Athletics blocked off the entirety of the Coliseum's third deck during its games, which artificially limited its capacity to 34,077 (making it the smallest stadium in Major League Baseball). On April 11, 2017, with Dave Kaval as the then-new team president, the Athletics began to reopen some of the sections in the third deck, and open the Mount Davis deck for selected marquee games; this configuration makes it, by contrast, the largest baseball stadium in the United States by capacity.\nThe current state of Oakland Coliseum has been widely criticized; fans and players alike consider the Coliseum to be poorly maintained and out of date. Along with Tropicana Field, it is often cited as one of the worst ballparks in Major League Baseball and consistently takes the last or second-to-last spot in rankings of stadiums.

The proposed Virginia Beach Arena would have been the largest in Virginia capable of staging these events.\nProjected to employ hundreds of full and part-time staff, the Arena's estimated cost was $210 million.

The northern portal lies just south of the East India Dock Road (A13) in Blackwall; the southern entrances are just south of The O2 on the Greenwich Peninsula. The road is managed by Transport for London (TfL).\nThe tunnel was originally opened as a single bore in 1897 by the Prince of Wales as a major transport project to improve commerce and trade in London's East End. It carried a mix of foot, cycle, horse-drawn and vehicular traffic. By the 1930s, capacity was becoming inadequate. A second bore opened in 1967 to relieve congestion, handling southbound traffic while the earlier 19th century tunnel handled northbound traffic.\nThe northern approach takes traffic from the A12 and the southern approach takes traffic from the A2, making the tunnel crossing a key link for both local and longer-distance traffic between the north and south sides of the river. It forms part of a key route into Central London from South East London and Kent and was the easternmost all-day crossing for vehicles before the opening of the Dartford Tunnel in 1963. \nIt remains the easternmost free fixed road crossing of the Thames, and regularly suffers congestion, to the extent that tidal flow schemes were in place from 1978 until their controversial removal in 2007. Given the very high traffic volumes at the crossing (and the height restrictions of the Victorian bore) the crossing is being supplemented by the Silvertown Tunnel, currently under construction. When the Silvertown Tunnel is completed in 2025, both it and the Blackwall Tunnels will be tolled.The tunnels are no longer open to pedestrians, cyclists or other non-motorised traffic, and the northbound tunnel has a 4.0-metre (13.1 ft) height limit.

The US Army wanted to extend this process to nutritious food, so NRC created a new subsidiary, the Florida Foods Corporation. Led by John M. Fox, Florida Foods Corporation won a government contract worth $750,000 for 500,000 lb (227,000 kg) of powdered orange juice for the war. The war ended and the contract was canceled before the factory could be built, but with investment, the company moved forward with a product.Rather than selling powder to the public market, the company decided to create frozen orange juice concentrate, using a process that eliminated 80 percent of the water in orange juice. A Boston marketing firm H. A. Loudon Advertising came up with the name Minute Maid, implying the juice was quick and easy to prepare.\nThe first shipment took place in April 1946. The same month, the company was renamed Vacuum Foods Corporation. With limited funds for advertising, Fox himself went door to door giving free samples, until demand skyrocketed. In October 1948, TIME magazine announced that entertainer Bing Crosby was to employ a 5-day a week radio show to promote Minute Maid. The magazine article gave further details: \"Minute Maid (retail price: 29\u00a2 a pint and a half) got into the field first in 1945, at a new $2,300,000 plant in Plymouth, Fla. With little cash to advertise, it lost $450,262 the first two years. Last year it finally turned the corner. Says Vacuum\u2019s President John M. Fox: \u201cWhy, this orange juice thing is the wonder of the grocery world. Ask anybody.\u201d Anybody in the frozen food industry agreed\u2014and Birds Eye, Snow Crop and others began to put out their own concentrate. Nevertheless, Vacuum\u2019s sales increased so much that President Fox announced last week that the net profit for its last fiscal year was $179,865. Demand is so great, said Fox, that Vacuum has had to allocate shipments and is thinking of setting up a California plant. The shortage temporarily takes some of the bloom off the Crosby deal.

The US Army wanted to extend this process to nutritious food, so NRC created a new subsidiary, the Florida Foods Corporation. Led by John M. Fox, Florida Foods Corporation won a government contract worth $750,000 for 500,000 lb (227,000 kg) of powdered orange juice for the war. The war ended and the contract was canceled before the factory could be built, but with investment, the company moved forward with a product.Rather than selling powder to the public market, the company decided to create frozen orange juice concentrate, using a process that eliminated 80 percent of the water in orange juice. A Boston marketing firm H. A. Loudon Advertising came up with the name Minute Maid, implying the juice was quick and easy to prepare.\nThe first shipment took place in April 1946. The same month, the company was renamed Vacuum Foods Corporation. With limited funds for advertising, Fox himself went door to door giving free samples, until demand skyrocketed. In October 1948, TIME magazine announced that entertainer Bing Crosby was to employ a 5-day a week radio show to promote Minute Maid. The magazine article gave further details: \"Minute Maid (retail price: 29\u00a2 a pint and a half) got into the field first in 1945, at a new $2,300,000 plant in Plymouth, Fla. With little cash to advertise, it lost $450,262 the first two years. Last year it finally turned the corner. Says Vacuum\u2019s President John M. Fox: \u201cWhy, this orange juice thing is the wonder of the grocery world. Ask anybody.\u201d Anybody in the frozen food industry agreed\u2014and Birds Eye, Snow Crop and others began to put out their own concentrate. Nevertheless, Vacuum\u2019s sales increased so much that President Fox announced last week that the net profit for its last fiscal year was $179,865.

Initially, it dealt with personal computer products, but later expanded to the development and publishing of video games, mobile content, video game peripherals and music recording. Primarily a video game publisher, it internally developed many of the video games it released while outsourcing others to external companies. It is known for series such as Bomberman, Adventure Island, Star Soldier, Bonk and Bloody Roar. Hudson also developed video games released by other publishers such as the Mario Party series from Nintendo. The mascot of the company is a bee named Hachisuke.\nHudson Soft made the TurboGrafx-16 in association with NEC, to compete against Nintendo, Sega, and SNK, while continuing making games on other platforms, as a third-party developer.\nHudson Soft ceased to exist as a company on March 1, 2012, and merged with Konami Digital Entertainment, which was the surviving entity.

It is located some 95 kilometres (59 mi) north-west of Paris and 40 kilometres (25 mi) from Rouen. Construction began in 1196 under the auspices of Richard the Lionheart, who was simultaneously King of England and feudal Duke of Normandy. The castle was expensive to build, but the majority of the work was done in an unusually short period of time. It took just two years and, at the same time, the town of Petit Andely was constructed. Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard has a complex and advanced design, and uses early principles of concentric fortification; it was also one of the earliest European castles to use machicolations. The castle consists of three enclosures separated by dry moats, with a keep in the inner enclosure.\nCh\u00e2teau Gaillard was captured in 1204 by the king of France, Philip II, after a lengthy siege. In the mid-14th century, the castle was the residence of the exiled David II of Scotland. The castle changed hands several times in the Hundred Years' War, but in 1449 the French king captured Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard from the English king definitively, and from then on it remained in French ownership. Henry IV of France ordered the demolition of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard in 1599; although it was in ruins at the time, it was felt to be a threat to the security of the local population. The castle ruins are listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. The inner bailey is open to the public from March to November, and the outer baileys are open all year.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_45578", "text": "Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard consists of three baileys\u2014an inner, a middle, and an outer with the main entrance to the castle\u2014and a keep, also called a donjon, in the inner bailey. The baileys, which were separated by rock-cut ditches, housed the castle's stables, workshops, and storage facilities. It is common for extant castles to be the result of several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard essentially is the result of one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities with the design of Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon, built by Henry II in the mid-12th century on a promontory overlooking a town.The outer bailey is the southernmost feature of the castle; it is pentagon shaped and there are five towers spaced along the wall, three of which are at corners. North of the outer bailey is the middle bailey which is an irregular polygon; like the outer bailey, the wall of the middle bailey is studded with towers. The towers allowed the garrison to provide enfilading fire. In the fashion of the time, most of the towers in the curtain walls of the middle and outer baileys were cylindrical. Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard was one of the first castles in Europe to use machicolations\u2014stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall. Machicolations were introduced to Western architecture as a result of the Crusades. Until the 13th century, the tops of towers in European castles had usually been surrounded by wooden galleries, which served the same purpose as machicolations. An Eastern innovation, they may have originated in the first half of the 8th century.Within the middle bailey was the inner bailey. The gatehouse from the middle of the inner bailey was one of the earliest examples of towers flanking the entrance to remove the blind spot immediately in front of the gate. This was part of a wider trend from around the late 12th or 13th century onwards for castle gateways to be strongly defended.The design of the inner bailey, with its wall studded with semicircular projections, is unparalleled. This innovation had two advantages: firstly, the rounded wall absorbed the damage from siege engines much better as it did not provide a perfect angle to aim at; secondly, the arrowslits in the curved wall allowed arrows to be fired at all angles. The inner bailey, which contained the main residential buildings, used the principles of concentric defence. This and the unusual design of the inner bailey's curtain wall meant that castle was advanced for its age, since it was built before concentric fortification was fully developed in Crusader castles such as Krak des Chevaliers. Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe; for instance, when Edward I of England\u2014who had himself been on Crusade\u2014built castles in Wales in the late 13th century, four of the eight he founded were concentric.The keep was inside the inner bailey and contained the king's accommodation. It had two rooms: an antechamber and an audience room. While Allen Brown interpreted the audience room as the king's chamber, historian Liddiard believes it is probably a throne room. A throne room emphasises the political importance of the castle. In England there is nothing similar to Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard's keep, but there are buildings with a similar design in France in the 12th and 13th centuries.Allen Brown described Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard as \"one of the finest castles in Europe\" and the military historian Sir Charles Oman wrote that:\n\nCh\u00e2teau Gaillard, as we have already had occasion to mention, was considered the masterpiece of its time. The reputation of its builder, Coeur de Lion, as a great military engineer might stand firm on this single structure. He was no mere copyist of the models he had seen in the East, but introduced many original details of his own invention into the stronghold.\nDespite Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard's reputation as a great fortress, Liddiard highlights the absence of a well in the keep as a peculiar weakness, and the castle was built on soft chalk, which would have allowed the walls to be undermined. But other sources evoke the presence of three wells in the three different baileys and the soft chalk does not really weaken the very thick walls.

Castles such as Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard in France, and Dover Castle in England, were amongst the most advanced of their age, but were surpassed in both sophistication and cost by the works of Edward I of England in the latter half of the 13th century.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "127_45578", "text": "Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard consists of three baileys\u2014an inner, a middle, and an outer with the main entrance to the castle\u2014and a keep, also called a donjon, in the inner bailey. The baileys, which were separated by rock-cut ditches, housed the castle's stables, workshops, and storage facilities. It is common for extant castles to be the result of several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard essentially is the result of one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities with the design of Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon, built by Henry II in the mid-12th century on a promontory overlooking a town.The outer bailey is the southernmost feature of the castle; it is pentagon shaped and there are five towers spaced along the wall, three of which are at corners. North of the outer bailey is the middle bailey which is an irregular polygon; like the outer bailey, the wall of the middle bailey is studded with towers. The towers allowed the garrison to provide enfilading fire. In the fashion of the time, most of the towers in the curtain walls of the middle and outer baileys were cylindrical. Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard was one of the first castles in Europe to use machicolations\u2014stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall. Machicolations were introduced to Western architecture as a result of the Crusades. Until the 13th century, the tops of towers in European castles had usually been surrounded by wooden galleries, which served the same purpose as machicolations. An Eastern innovation, they may have originated in the first half of the 8th century.Within the middle bailey was the inner bailey. The gatehouse from the middle of the inner bailey was one of the earliest examples of towers flanking the entrance to remove the blind spot immediately in front of the gate. This was part of a wider trend from around the late 12th or 13th century onwards for castle gateways to be strongly defended.The design of the inner bailey, with its wall studded with semicircular projections, is unparalleled. This innovation had two advantages: firstly, the rounded wall absorbed the damage from siege engines much better as it did not provide a perfect angle to aim at; secondly, the arrowslits in the curved wall allowed arrows to be fired at all angles. The inner bailey, which contained the main residential buildings, used the principles of concentric defence. This and the unusual design of the inner bailey's curtain wall meant that castle was advanced for its age, since it was built before concentric fortification was fully developed in Crusader castles such as Krak des Chevaliers. Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe; for instance, when Edward I of England\u2014who had himself been on Crusade\u2014built castles in Wales in the late 13th century, four of the eight he founded were concentric.The keep was inside the inner bailey and contained the king's accommodation. It had two rooms: an antechamber and an audience room. While Allen Brown interpreted the audience room as the king's chamber, historian Liddiard believes it is probably a throne room. A throne room emphasises the political importance of the castle. In England there is nothing similar to Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard's keep, but there are buildings with a similar design in France in the 12th and 13th centuries.Allen Brown described Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard as \"one of the finest castles in Europe\" and the military historian Sir Charles Oman wrote that:\n\nCh\u00e2teau Gaillard, as we have already had occasion to mention, was considered the masterpiece of its time. The reputation of its builder, Coeur de Lion, as a great military engineer might stand firm on this single structure. He was no mere copyist of the models he had seen in the East, but introduced many original details of his own invention into the stronghold.\nDespite Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard's reputation as a great fortress, Liddiard highlights the absence of a well in the keep as a peculiar weakness, and the castle was built on soft chalk, which would have allowed the walls to be undermined. But other sources evoke the presence of three wells in the three different baileys and the soft chalk does not really weaken the very thick walls. Its weakness is more the result of its location (higher hill behind), its extension (more than 200 metres (660 ft)) on a long narrow ridge and the difficulties in linking up the different baileys to allow a good communication and to secure an efficient defence without a large garrison.Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard was important not solely as a military structure, but as a salient symbol of the power of Richard the Lionheart.

'Agden' means 'Valley of the Oak Trees'.The reservoir is one of four built in the second half of the 19th century to satisfy the developing steel industry of Sheffield, collecting water from the moorlands around the village of Low Bradfield, west of Sheffield. The other three being Damflask, Dale Dike and Strines reservoirs. Agden was completed in 1869 and is fed by Hobson Moss Dike and Emlin Dike which flow off the Broomhead and Bradfield moors respectively. The reservoir is surrounded mainly by coniferous woodland, however, Sheffield City Council who own much of the woodland have started a policy of replanting and thinning to encourage broadleaved varieties of trees which give a better habitat for wildlife and also look more attractive.\nThe reservoir is ringed by a popular walk which starts in the village of Low Bradfield and takes in Agden Bog which is a protected wetland area managed by the Wildlife Trust for Sheffield and Rotherham. The Peak District Boundary Walk runs past the eastern end of the dam. The former Keeper's cottage is at the western side of the dam wall, now a private home, and Agden Lodge built in 1870 for Samuel Fox of Stocksbridge, remains as a private residence. There are also remnants of old farm dwellings around the reservoir - the Water Authorities allegedly had a policy of buying any available property around their reservoirs, solely for demolition, claiming they were a source of possible water contamination. Many fine old buildings were lost to this rationale, including Frost House early-1950s, Rocher Head Farm early-1960s and the 17thC Agden House on the western side, demolished 1972, although it's barn survives.

It was conceived in 1919 as a location for the national headquarters of the American Legion and a memorial to the state's and nation's veterans.\nThe original five-block plaza is bounded by Meridian Street (west), St. Clair Street (north), Pennsylvania Street (east), and New York Street (south). American Legion Mall comprises the two northernmost blocks and is home to the Legion's administrative buildings and a cenotaph. Veterans Memorial Plaza, with its obelisk, forms the third block. The plaza's focal point, the Indiana World War Memorial, is located on the fourth block. Modeled after the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, it houses a military museum and auditorium. The fifth and southernmost block is University Park, home to statues and a fountain.On October 11, 1994, the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza was designated a National Historic Landmark District. In 2016, the district was enlarged to include in its scope the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument and was renamed the Indiana World War Memorial Historic District. Combined, it is the largest war memorial project in the United States, encompassing 24 acres (9.7 ha).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_45634", "text": "The origins of the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza lay in a 1919 attempt by the city of Indianapolis to lure the newly formed American Legion from its temporary headquarters in New York City. The American Legion, chartered by Congress following World War I, is an organization of veterans that sponsors youth programs, promotes patriotism and national security and provides a commitment to Americans who have served in the armed forces.At an American Legion national convention in Minneapolis in November 1919, cities sent representatives to lobby to become the new headquarters. Indianapolis drew support because of its central location within the United States and the city's shows of patriotism. Although Washington, D.C. received the most votes on the first ballot, Indianapolis gained a majority and won the second with 361 votes of 684 cast.The city and state then had to provide a location, and one of the promises the city made was to erect a fitting memorial to those who served in World War I. Thus, in January 1920 a public library, St. Clair Park, University Park, and two occupied city blocks were designated as the site for the plaza, with one new building for the American Legion to use as their national headquarters, various public buildings, and a war memorial. The Indiana War Memorial Bill was passed in July 1920 and appropriated $2 million for construction and land. The city and state reached an agreement whereby the city would pay for the site and maintenance costs, while the State of Indiana would pay for the memorial's construction. The Plaza was dedicated by the Legion in November 1921 with the laying of a cornerstone from the bridge over the River Marne at Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry. About 45 buildings on the blocks were demolished in 1926, though several were relocated, and the Second Presbyterian Church and the First Baptist Church were not demolished until 1960.Various architects were invited by an appointed War Memorial Board, led by professional advisor and trustee Thomas Rogers Kimball, to submit designs for a memorial intended to honor all who fought in World War I and also to provide meeting places, archives, and offices for the American Legion. Cleveland, Ohio-based Walker and Weeks was selected in 1923. Their plan consisted of a central memorial and two auxiliary buildings, an obelisk, a mall, and a cenotaph. Bids for the American Legion building, one of the two auxiliary buildings, were put out in 1925, and construction by the Craig-Curtiss Company began the same year. The buildings were neoclassical in design to compliment the existing Central Library and U.S. Courthouse and Post Office; completed before the plaza's development, the buildings anchor the north and south ends of the plaza, respectively. The second auxiliary building was not constructed until 1950. When Congress authorized the payment of World War I veterans' bonuses in 1936, the state of Indiana used the money for the construction of the memorial plaza, rather than paying it to the veterans. One additional building was planned but never built.Indiana World War Memorial Plaza's buildings and greenspaces exemplify City Beautiful movement design principles organized on classical, uniform, and beautiful public architecture.

The American Legion, chartered by Congress following World War I, is an organization of veterans that sponsors youth programs, promotes patriotism and national security and provides a commitment to Americans who have served in the armed forces.At an American Legion national convention in Minneapolis in November 1919, cities sent representatives to lobby to become the new headquarters. Indianapolis drew support because of its central location within the United States and the city's shows of patriotism. Although Washington, D.C. received the most votes on the first ballot, Indianapolis gained a majority and won the second with 361 votes of 684 cast.The city and state then had to provide a location, and one of the promises the city made was to erect a fitting memorial to those who served in World War I. Thus, in January 1920 a public library, St. Clair Park, University Park, and two occupied city blocks were designated as the site for the plaza, with one new building for the American Legion to use as their national headquarters, various public buildings, and a war memorial. The Indiana War Memorial Bill was passed in July 1920 and appropriated $2 million for construction and land. The city and state reached an agreement whereby the city would pay for the site and maintenance costs, while the State of Indiana would pay for the memorial's construction. The Plaza was dedicated by the Legion in November 1921 with the laying of a cornerstone from the bridge over the River Marne at Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry. About 45 buildings on the blocks were demolished in 1926, though several were relocated, and the Second Presbyterian Church and the First Baptist Church were not demolished until 1960.Various architects were invited by an appointed War Memorial Board, led by professional advisor and trustee Thomas Rogers Kimball, to submit designs for a memorial intended to honor all who fought in World War I and also to provide meeting places, archives, and offices for the American Legion. Cleveland, Ohio-based Walker and Weeks was selected in 1923. Their plan consisted of a central memorial and two auxiliary buildings, an obelisk, a mall, and a cenotaph. Bids for the American Legion building, one of the two auxiliary buildings, were put out in 1925, and construction by the Craig-Curtiss Company began the same year. The buildings were neoclassical in design to compliment the existing Central Library and U.S. Courthouse and Post Office; completed before the plaza's development, the buildings anchor the north and south ends of the plaza, respectively. The second auxiliary building was not constructed until 1950. When Congress authorized the payment of World War I veterans' bonuses in 1936, the state of Indiana used the money for the construction of the memorial plaza, rather than paying it to the veterans. One additional building was planned but never built.Indiana World War Memorial Plaza's buildings and greenspaces exemplify City Beautiful movement design principles organized on classical, uniform, and beautiful public architecture. In 1989, the plaza was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was named a National Historic Landmark District in 1994.

The route, located in western Culberson County, is largely isolated passing through no cities or towns beyond Van Horn and intersecting no other highways between Van Horn and its northern terminus. Within Van Horn, the route has intersections with Business Interstate 10-D and Farm to Market Road 2185.\nThe route was established early in the history of the Texas highway system originally beginning in Alpine and ending at the New Mexico state line near Carlsbad, NM. The route's length and termini have changed over the years as have the roads with which it intersect largely due to two factors. First in the early years was the development of the United States Highway system which incorporated many parts of the former length of the route and even resulted in the brief elimination of SH 54 as well as other former state highways it intersected. Later was the construction of I-10 at Van Horn that caused SH 54 to be extended to meet the Interstate and resulted ultimately in the realignment and eventual decommissioning of US 80 in western Texas and changes in the designation of the former route of US 80 through the town.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "127_45715", "text": "This route was originally proposed in 1917 as part of a potential SH 10 beginning at the New Mexico state line, then proceeding south to Van Horn then southeast to Alpine before changing course to the northeast terminating in Fort Worth by way of Fort Stockton, Sonora, and Brady.

The road would then run parallel with the river to Brownsville and then travel along the Gulf Coast to Houston. In 1922, a further revision aligned this route similar to the current US 90 between Van Horn and Del Rio.SH 54 was originally established as a highway beginning at SH 3 in Alpine following the current US 90 to SH 1 in Van Horn.
