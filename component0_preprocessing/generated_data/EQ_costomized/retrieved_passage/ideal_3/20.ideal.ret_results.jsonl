This style, a century later, would make Guardi's works highly prized by the French Impressionists.\nCanaletto, as a vedutista, concentrated on glamorous urban architecture erected by the serene republic; on the other hand, in Guardi, the buildings often appear to be melting and sinking into a murky lagoon. Canaletto's canvases often have intricate linear and brilliant details, and depict Venice in sunny daylight. Guardi paints clouded skies above a city at dusk. These contrasts, however, simplify the facts, since Canaletto often painted the drab communal life and neighborhoods (creating in them some epic artistic qualities), while Guardi did not avoid sometimes painting the ceremonies of Ducal Venice. Ultimately, Guardi's paintings evoke the onset of the dissipation. The citizenry has shrunken to an impotent lilliputian crowd of \"rubber-neckers\", unable to rescue the crumbling Republic, as for example in the Fire in the Oil Depot in San Marcuola. It was fitting depiction of the rapidly declining empire, which had declined, in Napoleon's assessment, into a \"drawing room of Europe\" peopled with casinos, carnivals, and courtesans for hire.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Warren developed the technique of producing stereoscopic images of the breast with X-rays while working in the Department of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine.\nWarren was commissioned as a colonel in the United States Army Medical Corps in 1943 and appointed Chief of the Medical Section of the Manhattan Engineering District. He was responsible for the health and safety of the thousands of personnel involved in the Manhattan Project. He was present at the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo, New Mexico, where he was responsible for the safety aspects of the detonation of the world's first nuclear weapon. He led a survey team from the Manhattan Project to assess the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1946 he was Chief of the Radiological Safety Section of the Joint Task Force for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear test at Bikini Atoll.\nIn 1947 Warren became the first dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Under his leadership, the new school grew from nothing to a major medical school. Although controversial and opposed by James Bryant Conant, Warren would speak out about the dangers of nuclear fallout from weapons testing from about 1947 onwards and upon the Castle Bravo test in 1954 his views were lent some credence, which informed opinion leading up to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962 at UCLA. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation.

He arrived in San Francisco in the summer of 1874, but soon traveled south and founded an art colony on the Monterey Peninsula. In 1874, Tavernier came upon the tavern owned by his compatriot Jules Simoneau. Briefly, he established a studio at the Girandin Hotel (now called Stevenson House). In November 1875, Tavernier, alongside Walter Paris, leased space on Alvarado Street, establishing the first dedicated artist studio in Monterey. Tavernier's connection with Monterey led to his marriage to Lizzie Fulton in San Francisco in February 1877, whom he initially met in Monterey in 1876.

Her feast day is on 3 January.\nRecognized for her religious devotion at a young age, she met Germanus of Auxerre and Lupus of Troyes when she was a child and dedicated herself to a virginal life. Miracles and healings began to happen around her early on and she became to be known for changing the weather. She moved from Nanterre, her hometown, to Paris, after her parents died and became known for her piety, healings, and miracles, although the residents of Paris resented her and would have killed her if not for Germanus' interventions. Her prayers saved Paris from being destroyed by the Huns under Attila in 451 and other wars; her organisation of the city's women was called a \"prayer marathon\" and Genevieve's \"most famous feat\". She was involved in two major construction projects in Paris, a basilica in the honour of Saint Denis of Paris in 475 and the Basilica of the Holy Apostles, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, in c. 500.\nGenevieve performed miracles both before and after her death.

He is best known for the comic strip Little Nemo (1905\u20131914; 1924\u20131927) and the animated film Gertie the Dinosaur (1914). For contractual reasons, he worked under the pen name Silas on the comic strip Dream of the Rarebit Fiend.\nFrom a young age, McCay was a quick, prolific, and technically dextrous artist. He started his professional career making posters and performing for dime museums, and in 1898 began illustrating newspapers and magazines. In 1903 he joined the New York Herald, where he created popular comic strips such as Little Sammy Sneeze and Dream of the Rarebit Fiend. In 1905 his signature strip Little Nemo in Slumberland debuted\u2014a fantasy strip in an Art Nouveau style about a young boy and his adventurous dreams. The strip demonstrated McCay's strong graphic sense and mastery of color and linear perspective. McCay experimented with the formal elements of the comic strip page, arranging and sizing panels to increase impact and enhance the narrative. McCay also produced numerous detailed editorial cartoons and was a popular performer of chalk talks on the vaudeville circuit.\nMcCay was an early animation pioneer; between 1911 and 1921 he self-financed and animated ten films, some of which survive only as fragments. The first three served in his vaudeville act; Gertie the Dinosaur was an interactive routine in which McCay appeared to give orders to a trained dinosaur. McCay and his assistants worked for twenty-two months on his most ambitious film, The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918), a patriotic recreation of the German torpedoing in 1915 of the RMS Lusitania. Lusitania did not enjoy as much commercial success as the earlier films, and McCay's later movies attracted little attention. His animation, vaudeville, and comic strip work was gradually curtailed as newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, his employer since 1911, expected McCay to devote his energies to editorial illustrations.\nIn his drawing, McCay made bold, prodigious use of linear perspective, particularly in detailed architecture and cityscapes. He textured his editorial cartoons with copious fine hatching, and made color a central element in Little Nemo. His comic strip work has influenced generations of cartoonists and illustrators. The technical level of McCay's animation\u2014its naturalism, smoothness, and scale\u2014was unmatched until the work of Fleischer Studios in the late 1920s, followed by Walt Disney's feature films in the 1930s. He pioneered inbetweening, the use of registration marks, cycling, and other animation techniques that were to become standard.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_19588", "text": "Self-conscious and introverted in private, McCay was nevertheless a charismatic showman and self-promoter, and maintained several lifelong friendships. McCay was a light but frequent drinker; he drank for camaraderie rather than for a love of drinking. To his wife's chagrin, McCay was a smoker of cigars and cigarettes. He was self-taught at the piano, and was an avid reader of poetry, plays and novels; he admired W. B. Yeats, knew the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats, and could quote the Bible and Shakespeare.McCay stood barely five feet (150 cm) tall, and felt dominated by his wife, who was nearly as tall as he was. McCay married Maude Leonore Dufour, the youngest of three daughters of French-Canadian carriage painter John Dufour. About a decade separated the couple's ages: Maude was 14 when they married. Biographer Canemaker speculates this may explain the lack of certainty behind McCay's birthdate, even by McCay himself, as he may have claimed to be younger than he was to justify marrying a teenaged girl. Maude was also age-conscious: she preferred her grandchildren to call her \"Nan\" instead of \"Grandma\" and dyed her hair as she got older. The McCays took on the traditional roles of a married couple of the time, in that Winsor was the breadwinner and Maude the homemaker. Neither spouse got along well with the other's mother.\nThe couple had two children: Robert Winsor, born June 21, 1896; and Marion Elizabeth, born August 22, 1897. McCay was said to be easy-going with the children, and left discipline to their stern mother. Marion felt domineered by her mother and perceived that her brother was her mother's favorite; she was closer to her father and often appeared in public with him. Robert looked up to his father and became an artist himself. He was proud to have served as the model for Little Nemo.The McCays lived lavishly. McCay disliked driving, so kept a chauffeur who also served as bodyguard, as the editorial cartoons McCay drew for Hearst sometimes attracted threatening letters. Maude made daily trips by limousine to shop in upscale downtown Brooklyn with other well-to-do wives. Maude often complained to her husband, but he refused to discuss matters with her.McCay's politics are unclear, and it is disputed whether he sympathized with the views displayed in his editorial cartoons. He was agnostic and believed in reincarnation. He was a Freemason, whose ranks he may have joined as early as when he was living in Chicago. His father had also been a Freemason, and was buried in 1915 with full Masonic rites, with funerals arranged by his Masonic lodges in both Woodstock, Ontario, and Edmore, Michigan. His mother often visited him in Brooklyn, and attended Little Nemo's Philadelphia premiere. She died in Edmore, Michigan, in 1927.McCay's brother Arthur was placed in a mental hospital in Traverse City, Michigan on March 7, 1898, where he stayed until his death from bronchopneumonia and arteriosclerosis on June 15, 1946. He never received family visits. McCay never let his children know about his brother, nor did they know about the existence of his sister Mae, who died in 1910.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_19589", "text": "In 1937, McCay's son Robert attempted to carry on his father's legacy by reviving Little Nemo. Comic book packager Harry \"A\" Chesler's syndicate announced a Sunday and daily Nemo strip, credited to \"Winsor McCay Jr.\" Robert also drew a comic book version for Chesler called Nemo in Adventureland starring grown-up versions of Nemo and the Princess. Neither project lasted long. In 1947, Robert and fabric salesman Irving Mendelsohn organized the McCay Feature Syndicate, Inc. to revive the original Nemo strip from McCay's original art, modified to fit the size of modern newspaper pages. This revival also did not last.\n\nMcCay's original artwork has been poorly preserved. McCay insisted on having his originals returned to him, and a large collection that survived him was destroyed in a fire in the late 1930s. His wife was unsure how to handle the surviving pieces, so his son took on the responsibility and moved the collection to his own house. The family sold off some of the artwork when they were in need of cash. Responsibility for it passed to Mendelsohn, then later to daughter Marion. By the early twenty-first century, most of McCay's surviving artwork remained in family hands.McCay destroyed many of his original cans of film to create more storage space. Of what film he kept, much has not survived, as it was photographed on 35mm nitrate film, which decomposes and is highly flammable. Mendelsohn's son and a friend, both young animators, discovered the film in Mendelsohn's possession in 1947 and rescued what they could. In some cases, such as The Centaurs, only fragments could be saved. A negative and incomplete positive was discovered of Performing Animals, a film of animals playing instruments that may have been intended for McCay's vaudeville act; it was deemed unsalvageable and destroyed.In 1966, cartoonist Woody Gelman discovered the original artwork for many Little Nemo strips at a cartoon studio where McCay's son Robert had worked. Many of the recovered originals were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art under the direction of curator A. Hyatt Mayor. In 1973, Gelman published a collection of Little Nemo strips in Italy. His collection of McCay originals is preserved at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University.\nMcCay's work, grounded solidly in his understanding of realistic perspective, presaged the techniques featured in Walt Disney's feature films. Disney paid tribute to McCay in 1955 on an episode of Disneyland. The episode, \"The Story of Animated Drawing\", gave a history of animation, and dramatized McCay's vaudeville act with Gertie. Robert was invited to the Disney studios as a consultant on the episode, where Disney told him, \"Bob, all this should be your father's\".Animator and McCay biographer John Canemaker produced a film in 1974 called Remembering Winsor McCay, narrated by McCay's animation assistant John Fitzsimmons. Canemaker helped coordinate the first retrospective of McCay's films at the third International Animation Film Festival in 1975 in New York, which led to a film show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in winter 1975\u201376. Canemaker also wrote a biography in 1987 called Winsor McCay: His Life and Art. In 2005, a revised and expanded version of the biography was released, which comics scholar Jeet Heer called \"far and away the most scholarly and intelligent biography ever written about an American cartoonist\". Animation scholar Paul Wells stated, \"McCay's influence on the history of animation cannot be understated\". Film critic Richard Eder lamented that as an animation pioneer McCay was not able to reach the potential suggested by his work. Eder compared McCay to the Italian primitives of the early Renaissance, highly skilled \"in the limited techniques they could command\". Heer wrote that McCay's strength was in his visuals, but that his writing and characters were weak.\nItalian filmmaker Federico Fellini read Little Nemo in the children's magazine Il corriere dei piccoli, and the strip was a \"powerful influence\" on the filmmaker, according to Fellini biographer Peter Bondanella. Comics historian R. C. Harvey has called McCay \"the first original genius of the comic strip medium\" and in animation. Harvey said that McCay's contemporaries lacked the skill to continue with his innovations, so that they were left for future generations to rediscover and build upon.McCay's work has inspired cartoonists from Carl Barks to Art Spiegelman. Robert Crumb called McCay a \"genius\" and one of his favorite cartoonists. Art Spiegelman's 1974 \"Real Dream\" strip was partially inspired by Rarebit Fiend, and his In the Shadow of No Towers in 2004 appropriated some of McCay's imagery, and included a page of Little Nemo in its appendix. Maurice Sendak's children's book In the Night Kitchen (1970) was an homage to McCay's work, as was Rick Veitch' comic book series Roarin' Rick's Rarebit Fiends (1994\u201396). Kim Deitch and Simon Deitch's graphic novel The Boulevard of Broken Dreams revolved around a character named Winsor Newton, based on an aged McCay. Cartoonist Berke Breathed lamented that the conditions of newspaper cartooning had devolved to such a degree since McCay's time that, had he worked later in the century, he would not have been allotted space sufficient for his expansive full-page fantasies.\nAs Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams first appeared in print in 1899, McCay's major dream strips work have invited speculation of a Freudian influence. But it can be proved that McCay's influence, at least in a secondhand manner, reached Freud: Hungarian artist N\u00e1ndor Honti, heavily inspired by McCay's Rarebit Fiend, which he had seen when he lived in the United States from 1903 to about 1907, created a comic page titled \"A Francia Bonne \u00c1lma\" (\"A French Nanny's Dream\", often called \"A French Nurse's Dream,\" 1911), which was passed to Sigmund Freud by the Hungarian psychoanalyst S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi. Freud then included the comic in the 1914 edition of his book. Honti's comic strongly resembles the work of McCay in its theme, pacing, Art Nouveau style, and closing panel of the dreamer awakening in bed.\nThe Winsor McCay Award was established in 1972 to recognize individuals for lifetime or career contributions in animation, and is presented as part of the Annie Awards. The Hammer Museum in Los Angeles devoted a room to McCay's work as part of the Masters of American Comics exhibit in 2005. German publisher Taschen published a complete, boxed, full-size edition of Little Nemo in two volumes in 2014 entitled The Complete Little Nemo.The American astronomer Roy A. Tucker named the asteroid 113461 after McCay in 2002.Despite dispute over his birthplace, a public park and historical marker honor McCay in Spring Lake, Michigan. The marker, unveiled in 2009, is located in Winsor McCay Park. Winsor McCay Park is the modern-day location of where Union School once stood, wherein McCay \"illustrated his first 'commercial' for-sale illustration\" in 1880. Developers have been working since 2009 to develop the park into a more sophisticated memorial to McCay including \"a large Gertie the Dinosaur statue at the entrance of the park...a bronze statue of Winsor McCay that will be placed next to the historical marker/sign [and] Gertie the Dinosaur stepping-stone footprints [that] will meander through the park, leading back to a scaled-down replica of Union School.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_19588", "text": "Self-conscious and introverted in private, McCay was nevertheless a charismatic showman and self-promoter, and maintained several lifelong friendships. McCay was a light but frequent drinker; he drank for camaraderie rather than for a love of drinking. To his wife's chagrin, McCay was a smoker of cigars and cigarettes. He was self-taught at the piano, and was an avid reader of poetry, plays and novels; he admired W. B. Yeats, knew the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats, and could quote the Bible and Shakespeare.McCay stood barely five feet (150 cm) tall, and felt dominated by his wife, who was nearly as tall as he was. McCay married Maude Leonore Dufour, the youngest of three daughters of French-Canadian carriage painter John Dufour. About a decade separated the couple's ages: Maude was 14 when they married. Biographer Canemaker speculates this may explain the lack of certainty behind McCay's birthdate, even by McCay himself, as he may have claimed to be younger than he was to justify marrying a teenaged girl. Maude was also age-conscious: she preferred her grandchildren to call her \"Nan\" instead of \"Grandma\" and dyed her hair as she got older. The McCays took on the traditional roles of a married couple of the time, in that Winsor was the breadwinner and Maude the homemaker. Neither spouse got along well with the other's mother.\nThe couple had two children: Robert Winsor, born June 21, 1896; and Marion Elizabeth, born August 22, 1897. McCay was said to be easy-going with the children, and left discipline to their stern mother. Marion felt domineered by her mother and perceived that her brother was her mother's favorite; she was closer to her father and often appeared in public with him. Robert looked up to his father and became an artist himself. He was proud to have served as the model for Little Nemo.The McCays lived lavishly. McCay disliked driving, so kept a chauffeur who also served as bodyguard, as the editorial cartoons McCay drew for Hearst sometimes attracted threatening letters. Maude made daily trips by limousine to shop in upscale downtown Brooklyn with other well-to-do wives. Maude often complained to her husband, but he refused to discuss matters with her.McCay's politics are unclear, and it is disputed whether he sympathized with the views displayed in his editorial cartoons. He was agnostic and believed in reincarnation. He was a Freemason, whose ranks he may have joined as early as when he was living in Chicago. His father had also been a Freemason, and was buried in 1915 with full Masonic rites, with funerals arranged by his Masonic lodges in both Woodstock, Ontario, and Edmore, Michigan. His mother often visited him in Brooklyn, and attended Little Nemo's Philadelphia premiere. She died in Edmore, Michigan, in 1927.McCay's brother Arthur was placed in a mental hospital in Traverse City, Michigan on March 7, 1898, where he stayed until his death from bronchopneumonia and arteriosclerosis on June 15, 1946. He never received family visits. McCay never let his children know about his brother, nor did they know about the existence of his sister Mae, who died in 1910.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_19589", "text": "In 1937, McCay's son Robert attempted to carry on his father's legacy by reviving Little Nemo. Comic book packager Harry \"A\" Chesler's syndicate announced a Sunday and daily Nemo strip, credited to \"Winsor McCay Jr.\" Robert also drew a comic book version for Chesler called Nemo in Adventureland starring grown-up versions of Nemo and the Princess. Neither project lasted long. In 1947, Robert and fabric salesman Irving Mendelsohn organized the McCay Feature Syndicate, Inc. to revive the original Nemo strip from McCay's original art, modified to fit the size of modern newspaper pages. This revival also did not last.\n\nMcCay's original artwork has been poorly preserved. McCay insisted on having his originals returned to him, and a large collection that survived him was destroyed in a fire in the late 1930s. His wife was unsure how to handle the surviving pieces, so his son took on the responsibility and moved the collection to his own house. The family sold off some of the artwork when they were in need of cash. Responsibility for it passed to Mendelsohn, then later to daughter Marion. By the early twenty-first century, most of McCay's surviving artwork remained in family hands.McCay destroyed many of his original cans of film to create more storage space. Of what film he kept, much has not survived, as it was photographed on 35mm nitrate film, which decomposes and is highly flammable. Mendelsohn's son and a friend, both young animators, discovered the film in Mendelsohn's possession in 1947 and rescued what they could. In some cases, such as The Centaurs, only fragments could be saved. A negative and incomplete positive was discovered of Performing Animals, a film of animals playing instruments that may have been intended for McCay's vaudeville act; it was deemed unsalvageable and destroyed.In 1966, cartoonist Woody Gelman discovered the original artwork for many Little Nemo strips at a cartoon studio where McCay's son Robert had worked. Many of the recovered originals were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art under the direction of curator A. Hyatt Mayor. In 1973, Gelman published a collection of Little Nemo strips in Italy.

In 1753, Graff started studying painting at the art school of Johann Ulrich Schellenberg in Winterthur. After three years he left Winterthur for Augsburg. There he worked with the etcher Johann Jakob Haid. However, only one year later he was forced to leave Augsburg. He was too successful. The members of the local painters guild feared his competition. With a letter of recommendation from Johann Jakob Haid, he moved to Ansbach where he found employment with the court painter Leonhard Schneider until 1759. Graff travelled frequently to Munich to study the paintings in the different collections. In 1759, he went back to Augsburg and later moved to Regensburg. In 1765 he went back to Winterthur and Zurich. It was there where he received an invitation from Christian Ludwig von Hagedorn, the newly appointed Director of the recently established Dresden Art Academy, to apply for a post at the Dresden Art Academy. Graff hesitated to do so. He thought he was not good enough to work for the princely court of Saxony. To give Hagedorn an impression of his talent he sent a self-portrait to Dresden. The self-portrait arrived on 16 January 1766, in Dresden. It was so well received that only one day later Hagedorn worked out Graff's employment contract. On 7 April 1766, Graff arrived in Dresden where he was appointed court painter and teacher for portrait painting at the Dresden Art Academy, a post he kept for life although he got better paid offers at other academies, among others in Berlin. In early 1788, the Prussian Minister Friedrich Anton von Heynitz made Graff the financially very attractive offer to work for the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. On 7 May 1789, Graff informed Count Camillo Marcolini, general director of the Dresden Art Academy, about this. Marcolini reacted straight away. On 20 June 1789, Graff was appointed Professor for portrait painting at the Dresden Art Academy.Graff made portraits of nearly 1,000 of his contemporaries and was the leading portrait painter in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th century. Graff was also the main portrait painter of German poets between the Enlightenment and the early Romantic periods. Many of them were also his friends, like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe whom he met in Dresden in 1768. Graff was the favourite portrait painter of the German, Russian, Polish and Baltic nobility. Among others he portrayed Stanislaw Kostka Potocki. His most important clients included Catherine the Great of Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia. His portrait of Frederick the Great is regarded as his masterpiece. The painting is exhibited at Schloss Charlottenburg. Frederick the Great never posed for Graff. However, Graff received authorization to watch Frederick at a military parade in 1781. This gave Graff the chance to study the physiognomy of the King, and was therefore the basis for his portrait.Graff was also very popular with the landed gentry, diplomats, musicians and scholars. He portrayed many of them. While painting a portrait, Graff always focused the light on the person's face. In Graff's portraits it was always the face that got the attention and the light, except when the sitter was a lady. In that case he also focused on the lady's d\u00e9collet\u00e9. Graff was a master of light and shadow. His role model in this context was J\u00e1n Kupeck\u00fd whose works he studied in the collections of Ansbach. In comparison with the calmness of the ladies the gentlemen in his portraits often appear serious and reserved.\nHe also knew how to paint dresses and draperies of different materials and colours in a natural way. His role model in this field was the French court painter Hyacinthe Rigaud. In 1765/66 Graff portrayed Elisabeth Sulzer in a blue silk dress with silver laces and fur collar and borders.\nIn his early years, Graff did hardly ever paint any background details in his portraits. He usually kept the background monochrome. However, in his later years he also paid more attention to the background. Usually he painted the sitter in outdoor surroundings, as was the fashion at that time in England. The price for a portrait by Graff was calculated by size and details of the sitter's clothes. That it was not always easy for Graff to portrait the famous of the time shows the remark he made while painting Friedrich Schiller: \"He cannot sit still.\" Graff was much in demand. He could live a comfortable life with his income.\nIn 1769 Graff met Philipp Erasmus Reich, a well known bookseller and publisher in Leipzig. Reich became a good friend of Graff. He engaged him to portrait his scholar friends. In September 1771, Graff travelled to Berlin and portrayed Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in Johann Georg Sulzer's apartment. Lessing's comment on his portrait was: \"Do I really look that terribly nice?\" In Berlin Graff also portrayed Moses Mendelssohn and Johann Georg Sulzer, his future father-in-law.\nIn his later years Graff turned to painting landscapes and developed further a sparkling manner of painting that anticipated Impressionism. Philipp Otto Runge and Caspar David Friedrich were influenced by his work.\nGraff was a sociable person. He cultivated friendships with many of his sitters, business partners and colleagues such as the Polish engraver Daniel Chodowiecki, the Swiss painters Salomon Gessner and Adrian Zingg and the Saxon engraver Johann Friedrich Bause. Bause reproduced many of Graff's portraits as engravings. This made Graff's name and his artworks also well known within the general public.\nGraff travelled quite often to Berlin. His father-in-law, Johann Georg Sulzer, introduced him to members of the Prussian court. He became very popular with the Prussian nobility and they were good customers of him. He never forgot how well he was received within the Prussian society. In 1778 he closed the short autobiography with the sentence: \"Berlin habe ich viel zu verdanken\" (I owe Berlin much).On 16 October 1771, Anton Graff married Elisabetha Sophie Augusta Sulzer, called \"Guste\". Graff and his wife had 5 children. The first daughter, Johanna Catharina Henrietta, died the same year she was born in 1772. Another daughter was born in 1779 and died only a few months later. His second son, Georg, died in 1801. In 1803 Graff underwent cataract surgery. His wife Elisabeth died in 1812. Graff himself died of typhoid fever in the evening of 22 June 1813, at around 8pm in Dresden. He was 76 years old.

Among the greatest of the Victorian art-architects, he sought in his work to escape from both nineteenth-century industrialisation and the Neoclassical architectural style and re-establish the architectural and social values of a utopian medieval England. Burges stands within the tradition of the Gothic Revival, his works echoing those of the Pre-Raphaelites and heralding those of the Arts and Crafts movement.\nBurges's career was short but illustrious; he won his first major commission for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral in Cork in 1863 when he was 35. He died in 1881 at his Kensington home,  The Tower House aged only 53. His architectural output was small but varied. Working with a long-standing team of craftsmen, he built churches, a cathedral, a warehouse, a university, a school, houses and castles.\nBurges's most notable works are Cardiff Castle, constructed between 1866 and 1928, and Castell Coch (1872\u201391), both of which were built for John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. Other significant buildings include Gayhurst House, Buckinghamshire (1858\u201365), Knightshayes Court (1867\u201374), the Church of Christ the Consoler (1870\u201376), St Mary's, Studley Royal (1870\u201378), in Yorkshire, and Park House, Cardiff (1871\u201380).\nMany of his designs were never executed or were subsequently demolished or altered. His competition entries for cathedrals at Lille (1854), Adelaide (1856), Colombo, Brisbane (1859), Edinburgh (1873), and Truro (1878) were all unsuccessful. He lost out to George Edmund Street in the competition for the Royal Courts of Justice (1866\u201367) in The Strand. His plans for the redecoration of the interior of St Paul's Cathedral (1870\u201377) were abandoned and he was dismissed from his post. Skilbeck's Warehouse (1865\u201366) was demolished in the 1970s, and work at Salisbury Cathedral (1855\u201359), Worcester College, Oxford (1873\u201379), and at Knightshayes Court had been lost in the decades before.\nBeyond architecture, Burges designed metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, furniture and stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, a series of lectures he gave to the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. The revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth century led to a renewed appreciation of Burges and his work.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_19726", "text": "Burges was born on 2 December 1827, the son of Alfred Burges (1796\u20131886), a wealthy civil engineer. Alfred amassed a considerable fortune, which enabled his son to devote his life to the study and practice of architecture without requiring that he actually earn a living.\nBurges entered King's College School, London, in 1839 to study engineering, his contemporaries there including Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti. He left in 1844 to join the office of Edward Blore, surveyor to Westminster Abbey. Blore was an established architect, having worked for both William IV and Queen Victoria, and had made his reputation as a proponent of the Gothic Revival. In 1848 or 1849, Burges moved to the offices of Matthew Digby Wyatt. Wyatt was as prominent an architect as Blore, evidenced by his leading role in the direction of The Great Exhibition in 1851. Burges's work with Wyatt, particularly on the Medieval Court for this exhibition, was influential on the subsequent course of his career. During this period, he also worked on drawings of medieval metalwork for Wyatt's book, Metalwork, published in 1852, and assisted Henry Clutton with illustrations for his works.Of equal importance to Burges's subsequent career was his travelling. Burges believed that all architects should travel, remarking that it was \"absolutely necessary to see how various art problems have been resolved in different ages by different men.\" Enabled by his private income, Burges moved through England, then France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and finally into Turkey. In total, he spent some 18 months abroad developing his skills and knowledge by sketching and drawing. What he saw and drew provided a repository of influences and ideas that he used and re-used for the whole of his career.Although he never went beyond Turkey, the art and architecture of the East, both Near and Far, had a significant impact on him; his fascination with Moorish design found ultimate expression in the Arab Room at Cardiff Castle, and his study of Japanese techniques influenced his later metalwork. Burges received his first important commission at the age of 35, but his subsequent career did not see the development that might have been expected. His style had already been formed over the previous twenty years of study, thinking and travelling. J. Mordaunt Crook, the foremost authority on Burges, writes that, \"once established, after twenty years' preparation, his 'design language' had merely to be applied, and he applied and reapplied the same vocabulary with increasing subtlety and gusto.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_19727", "text": "In 1856 Burges established his own architectural practice in London at 15 Buckingham Street, The Strand.

His early architectural career produced nothing of major note, although he won prestigious commissions, which remained unbuilt, for Lille Cathedral, the Crimea Memorial Church and the Bombay School of Art.His failed entry for the Law Courts in the Strand, if successful, would have given London its own Carcassonne, the plans being described by the architectural writers Dixon and Muthesius as \"a recreation of a thirteenth-century dream world [with] a skyline of great inventiveness.\" In 1859, he submitted a French-inspired design for St John's Cathedral in Brisbane, Australia, which was rejected. He also provided designs for Colombo Cathedral in Ceylon and St Francis Xavier's Cathedral, Adelaide, without success.In 1855, however, he obtained a commission for the reconstruction of the chapter house of Salisbury Cathedral. Henry Clutton was the lead architect but Burges, as assistant, contributed to the restoration of the sculpture and to the general decorative scheme. Much was lost in restorations of the 1960s.

Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple. The listed status of the Maison Dieu was reclassified as Grade I in 2017 and Dover District Council, the building's owner, is seeking grant funding to enable a restoration, focussing on Burges's work.In 1859\u201360, Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter, working with Poynter's son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher. He commissioned Edward Burne-Jones of James Powell & Sons to make three stained-glass windows for the east end, representing the Tree of Jesse. The Abbey is a demonstration of Burges's skills as a restorer, with \"a profound sensitivity towards medieval architecture.\" Mordaunt Crook wrote of Burges's interior that, \"it meets the Middle Ages as an equal.\"\nIn 1861\u20132, Burges was commissioned by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, to build All Saints Church, Fleet, as a memorial to Lefroy's wife. She was the daughter of James Walker, who established the marine engineering company of Walker and Burges with Burges's father Alfred, and this family connection brought Burges the commission. Pevsner says of Fleet that \"it has no shape, nor character nor notable buildings, except one,\" that one being All Saints. The church is of red brick and Pevsner considered it \"astonishingly restrained.\" The interior too is simply decorated but the massive sculpture, particularly of the tomb of the Lefroys and of the gabled arch below which the tomb originally stood, is quintessentially Burges, Crook describing it as \"not so much muscular (gothic) as muscle-bound.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_19726", "text": "Burges was born on 2 December 1827, the son of Alfred Burges (1796\u20131886), a wealthy civil engineer. Alfred amassed a considerable fortune, which enabled his son to devote his life to the study and practice of architecture without requiring that he actually earn a living.\nBurges entered King's College School, London, in 1839 to study engineering, his contemporaries there including Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti. He left in 1844 to join the office of Edward Blore, surveyor to Westminster Abbey. Blore was an established architect, having worked for both William IV and Queen Victoria, and had made his reputation as a proponent of the Gothic Revival. In 1848 or 1849, Burges moved to the offices of Matthew Digby Wyatt. Wyatt was as prominent an architect as Blore, evidenced by his leading role in the direction of The Great Exhibition in 1851. Burges's work with Wyatt, particularly on the Medieval Court for this exhibition, was influential on the subsequent course of his career. During this period, he also worked on drawings of medieval metalwork for Wyatt's book, Metalwork, published in 1852, and assisted Henry Clutton with illustrations for his works.Of equal importance to Burges's subsequent career was his travelling. Burges believed that all architects should travel, remarking that it was \"absolutely necessary to see how various art problems have been resolved in different ages by different men.\" Enabled by his private income, Burges moved through England, then France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and finally into Turkey. In total, he spent some 18 months abroad developing his skills and knowledge by sketching and drawing. What he saw and drew provided a repository of influences and ideas that he used and re-used for the whole of his career.Although he never went beyond Turkey, the art and architecture of the East, both Near and Far, had a significant impact on him; his fascination with Moorish design found ultimate expression in the Arab Room at Cardiff Castle, and his study of Japanese techniques influenced his later metalwork. Burges received his first important commission at the age of 35, but his subsequent career did not see the development that might have been expected. His style had already been formed over the previous twenty years of study, thinking and travelling. J. Mordaunt Crook, the foremost authority on Burges, writes that, \"once established, after twenty years' preparation, his 'design language' had merely to be applied, and he applied and reapplied the same vocabulary with increasing subtlety and gusto.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_19727", "text": "In 1856 Burges established his own architectural practice in London at 15 Buckingham Street, The Strand.

Rivera reportedly told Alfredo Cristiani, the President of El Salvador to post soldiers outside his offices.  \"Don't get me wrong\", Rivera then told the president. \"It's not that I trust the soldiers. But if I'm killed, I want it clear who did it.\"The UCA massacre put pressure on the government to end the war and sign a peace deal.  Rivera moderated the negotiations of the final Peace Accords signed between the Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN) and the Salvadoran government in 1992.  In the final years of his ministry, Rivera eagerly instituted a canonization process for his martyred predecessor.Rivera died on 26 November 1994. During a 1996 visit to the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Holy Savior (Catedral Metropolitana de San Salvador) where Rivera and his predecessors are buried, Pope John Paul II said that Rivera \"entered into eternity after having seen the peace, for which he and the other bishops of El Salvador had worked tirelessly, burst over the horizon.\"\n\n\n== Footnotes ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

Among the important international venues at which he sang were La Scala, Milan, (in 1923-26) and the New York Metropolitan Opera (in 1923-25). Additionally, in 1926, he had the honour of creating the role of Calaf in Puccini's posthumously-premiered final opera, Turandot, at the insistence of La Scala's principal conductor, Arturo Toscanini. But this taxing dramatic role took him to the limit of his resources and he did not attempt it again.\nFleta made his operatic debut in Trieste in 1919, having previously studied voice at the Madrid conservatory. Successful engagements in Rome followed, leading to his La Scala and Met debuts. He quit the Met in acrimonious circumstances, however, and the resultant legal action stopped him performing again in the United States.\nHe was celebrated during his best years for the finesse with which he used his rich, flexible voice. The most notable aspect of his performance style was the nimbleness of his bel canto technique. This enabled him to produce spectacular messa di voce and pianissimo effects. Unfortunately, Fleta's singing became increasingly self-indulgent as his career progressed. By the late 1920s, as recordings show, his voice had deteriorated badly, with his vibrato loosening to an undesirable extent.\nFleta died in straitened circumstances in 1938.

The catheter is used to monitor heart conditions, especially in intensive care units.  Ganz was also one of the first cardiologists to use enzymes to open clogged arteries, which can lead to heart attacks.Ganz was born in Kosice, Czechoslovakia, located in modern-day Slovakia, in 1919. He enrolled at the Charles University School of Medicine in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1938. The school was closed in 1940 following the start of Nazi Germany's occupation Czechoslovakia.  Ganz, who was Jewish, was sent to a Nazi labor camp in Hungary during World War II. He was scheduled to be sent to Auschwitz in 1944, but escaped and went into hiding. After World War II, Ganz graduated from Charles University in 1947 at the top of his class.Ganz worked in Czechoslovakia, which was under Communist rule at the time.  In 1966, Ganz was permitted to take his wife, Magda, and the couple's two sons on a vacation to Italy. Instead, the family went to Vienna, Austria, where they applied for a visa to the United States. He had relatives in Los Angeles, which allowed the family to move to the United States.  Ganz gained a position at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he remained for the rest of his career.Ganz and Dr. Jeremy Swan first developed the idea for the pulmonary artery catheter in 1970.  A balloon is placed at the end of a flexible catheter, which is inserted into the pulmonary artery.  Additionally, Ganz had a role in the development of thrombolysis, in which enzymes break down blood clots.Ganz died of natural causes on November 11, 2009, at the age of 90.  He was survived by his sons, Dr. Peter Ganz, a cardiologist at UCSF, and Dr. Tomas Ganz, a pulmonologist at UCLA.  His wife, Magda Ganz, died in 2005.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

An outfielder and first baseman, he played the last five seasons of his 11-year professional career after being diagnosed with leukemia while serving in the United States Army in 1962. Bond died of the disease in the closing weeks of the 1967 baseball season \u2014 a year during which he had made the Twins' roster coming out of spring training.\nThe native of Denmark, Tennessee, attended Lane College; he stood 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall and weighed 228 pounds (103 kg), threw right-handed and batted left-handed. With his imposing size, he was an effective power hitter who also batted for average (.299) during his minor league career, and brief Negro leagues career with the Kansas City Monarchs. In 1962, the year of his diagnosis, Bond batted .320 in 132 games for the Salt Lake City Bees of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. Then, in a 12-game September stint with the Indians, Bond hit six home runs in only 50 at bats, drove in 17 runs, batted .380 and slugged .800.  Yet he could not make the 1963 Indians roster and spent that campaign in Triple-A.\nOn December 19, 1963, he was acquired by Houston. The Colt .45s' general manager, Paul Richards, was aware of Bond's illness, but the team doctor examined Bond and determined his leukemia was in remission.  Bond then turned in his best major league season as the starting first baseman for the 1964 Colt .45s, leading Houston in home runs (20) and runs batted in (85), and appearing in 148 games. The following year, Bond held onto his starting job, but his production slumped with the team's move into the Astrodome; some teammates later speculated that his leukemia had recurred that season, affecting his play.

Dolci became a kind of cult hero in the United States and Northern Europe; he was idolised, in particular by idealistic youngsters, and support committees were formed to raise funds for his projects.In 1958 he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize, despite being an explicit non-communist. He was twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), which in 1947 received the Nobel Peace Prize along with the British Friends Service Council, now called Quaker Peace and Social Witness, on behalf of all Quakers worldwide.

He served President Mobutu Sese Seko as his personal physician, pilot, director of security, and was Surgeon General of the nation's army. He developed a hospital ship that traveled the Congo, bringing medical care, and, more importantly, medical education to remote village healers. Medical research at the Mama Yemo Hospital was very important to the understanding of the HIV-AIDS disease, and changed the worldwide practice of always repeating C-Section deliveries.In the mid-1970s, the Ebola virus broke out at a missionary hospital in rural Yambuku, near the Ebola River. The disease, which was characterized by severe sore throat, rash, abdominal pain, and bleeding from multiple sites, had killed 11 of the 17 medical staff at the hospital, forcing it to close. Panic was in the air, with roads blocked, river traffic stopped, and commercial air travel restricted. The army would not enter the area and President Mobutu was said to have left the country and fled to France, in the face of fears that the disease could spread to others, as those infected with the disease tried to escape the center of the outbreak.On his way back home to the United States for a home leave, Dr. Close returned to Kinshasa from Geneva, discussing the issue on the flight with two physicians from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Joel G. Breman and Peter Piot, who discovered the Ebola virus. Back in Zaire, Close obtained airplanes and pilots from the Ministry of Health to transport medical equipment to the affected area, using his personal connection to President Mobutu to obtain the access he needed. Close coordinated efforts in the area, ensuring that medical supplies were directed to where they were most needed. After providing protective equipment for hospital workers, sterilizing medical supplies, and quarantining patients, the team was able to break the chain of transmission of the virus, with almost 90% of the 318 people infected left dead.Blood samples that Close had collected in the 1970s were used to investigate the progress of the AIDS pandemic, showing that the rate of infection had been stable at 0.8% by comparing new samples to the older ones that had been collected in Zaire, one of the few sets of historical specimens available to perform this analysis.

He served President Mobutu Sese Seko as his personal physician, pilot, director of security, and was Surgeon General of the nation's army. He developed a hospital ship that traveled the Congo, bringing medical care, and, more importantly, medical education to remote village healers. Medical research at the Mama Yemo Hospital was very important to the understanding of the HIV-AIDS disease, and changed the worldwide practice of always repeating C-Section deliveries.In the mid-1970s, the Ebola virus broke out at a missionary hospital in rural Yambuku, near the Ebola River. The disease, which was characterized by severe sore throat, rash, abdominal pain, and bleeding from multiple sites, had killed 11 of the 17 medical staff at the hospital, forcing it to close. Panic was in the air, with roads blocked, river traffic stopped, and commercial air travel restricted. The army would not enter the area and President Mobutu was said to have left the country and fled to France, in the face of fears that the disease could spread to others, as those infected with the disease tried to escape the center of the outbreak.On his way back home to the United States for a home leave, Dr. Close returned to Kinshasa from Geneva, discussing the issue on the flight with two physicians from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Joel G. Breman and Peter Piot, who discovered the Ebola virus. Back in Zaire, Close obtained airplanes and pilots from the Ministry of Health to transport medical equipment to the affected area, using his personal connection to President Mobutu to obtain the access he needed. Close coordinated efforts in the area, ensuring that medical supplies were directed to where they were most needed. After providing protective equipment for hospital workers, sterilizing medical supplies, and quarantining patients, the team was able to break the chain of transmission of the virus, with almost 90% of the 318 people infected left dead.Blood samples that Close had collected in the 1970s were used to investigate the progress of the AIDS pandemic, showing that the rate of infection had been stable at 0.8% by comparing new samples to the older ones that had been collected in Zaire, one of the few sets of historical specimens available to perform this analysis. This showed that HIV infection rates could have been stable in rural Africa before it spread throughout the world.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Finney was of Scotch-Irish descent; he was named in memory of Louis Klopsch, a German-American immigrant and founder of The Christian Herald magazine, who died in 1910.  An older brother, Hal, was also a Major League player, a catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nLou Finney's professional baseball career began in the minor leagues in 1930; the next season, he was called up to the pennant-bound Athletics in September, and he batted .375 in nine games\u2014including back-to-back three-hit outings against the Cleveland Indians on September 14\u201315.  He did not appear in the 1931 World Series, which Philadelphia lost to the St. Louis Cardinals, and spent 1932 with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League, batting .351 with 268 hits.\nFinney then split 1933 between the Athletics, getting into 74 games as a back-up outfielder, and the top-level Montreal Royals of the International League.  In 1934, he made the Athletics for good, but the Mackmen were beginning a 13-year streak of futility that would see them plummet to the bottom of the American League standings nine times, including 1935, 1936 and 1938.  Finney was the club's regular first baseman in both 1936 and 1938, batting .302 with 197 hits in the former year.\nThen, on May 8, 1939, his contract was purchased by the first division Red Sox.  With Boston, Finney benefited from the batting tips offered by Hall of Famer Hugh Duffy, a veteran Red Sox scout and hitting instructor.  He hit .325 in part-time service in 1939, then took over as the Red Sox' regular right fielder in 1940, with Ted Williams shifting to left field. Finney batted .320 with 171 hits, and was named to the 1940 American League All-Star Team.\nFinney held onto the Red Sox' right-fielder job in both 1941 and 1942, although his batting average dipped below .290 each season. With World War II raging, he spent the 1943 campaign working his Alabama farm before returning to the Majors for two full seasons (1944\u201345) and parts of 1946 and 1947.\nIn 15 Major League seasons, Finney played in 1,270 games and had 4,631 at bats, 643 runs scored, 1,329 hits, 203 doubles, 85 triples, 31 home runs, 494 runs batted in, 39 stolen bases, 329 bases on balls, a .287 batting average, .336 on-base percentage, .388 slugging percentage, 1,795 total bases and 63 sacrifice hits.

In addition to being a six-time winner of France's most important race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Boussac's horses also won the prestigious Epsom Derby, Epsom Oaks, 2,000 Guineas, St. Leger Stakes, Ascot Gold Cup and others in the United Kingdom.\n\nWith the Fall of France in the Second World War, Boussac paid a British Royal Air Force officer on secret business to fly him from Paris to the UK. This caused the officer Sidney Cotton to be removed from his position. During the German occupation of France in World War II, the Nazis seized some of the best racehorses in the country. They shipped more than six hundred of them out of the country, some to Hungary but most back to Germany for racing or for breeding at the German National Stud.

The Mon king reputedly rejected Anawrahta's request, saying that the uncultured Burmans of the north were not worthy of the religion. This refusal was used by Anawrahta as pretense to invade and conquer the Mon kingdom. Despite this account, it is more likely Anawrahta conquered Thaton in order to check the westward advance of Khmer Empire in the Tenasserim coast. Still according to traditional belief, Manuha and his family along with some 30,000 monks and artisans, were brought back to Pagan (Bagan). Between 1050 and about 1085, Mon craftsmen and artisans helped to build some two thousand monuments at Pagan, the remains of which today rival the splendors of Angkor Wat.However, recent research\u2014still a minority view\u2014argues that Mon influence on the interior after Anawrahta's conquest is a greatly exaggerated post-Pagan legend, and that Lower Burma in fact lacked a substantial independent polity prior to Pagan's expansion.

He is known for his scientific contributions to theory of chemical equilibria via the mechanism of reverse chemical reactions, and for his contribution to modern chemical nomenclature.

Berthollet's great new developments in works regarding chemistry made him, in a short period of time, an active participant of the Academy of Science in 1780.\nBerthollet, along with Antoine Lavoisier and others, devised a chemical nomenclature, or a system of names, which serves as the basis of the modern system of naming chemical compounds.\nHe also carried out research into dyes and bleaches, being first to introduce the use of chlorine gas as a commercial bleach in 1785. He first produced a modern bleaching liquid in 1789 in his laboratory on the quay Javel in Paris, France, by passing chlorine gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as \"Eau de Javel\" (\"Javel water\"), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. Another strong chlorine oxidant and bleach which he investigated and was the first to produce, potassium chlorate (KClO3), is known as Berthollet's Salt.\nBerthollet first determined the elemental composition of the gas ammonia, in 1785.\nBerthollet was one of the first chemists to recognize the characteristics of a reverse reaction, and hence, chemical equilibrium.\nBerthollet was engaged in a long-term battle with another French chemist, Joseph Proust, on the validity of the law of definite proportions. While Proust believed that chemical compounds are composed of a fixed ratio of their constituent elements irrespective of the methods of production, Berthollet believed that this ratio can change according to the ratio of the reactants initially taken. Although Proust proved his theory by accurate measurements, his theory was not immediately accepted partially due to Berthollet's authority. His law was finally accepted when Berzelius confirmed it in 1811, but it was found later that Berthollet was not completely wrong because there exists a class of compounds that do not obey the law of definite proportions.

Berthollet's great new developments in works regarding chemistry made him, in a short period of time, an active participant of the Academy of Science in 1780.\nBerthollet, along with Antoine Lavoisier and others, devised a chemical nomenclature, or a system of names, which serves as the basis of the modern system of naming chemical compounds.\nHe also carried out research into dyes and bleaches, being first to introduce the use of chlorine gas as a commercial bleach in 1785. He first produced a modern bleaching liquid in 1789 in his laboratory on the quay Javel in Paris, France, by passing chlorine gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as \"Eau de Javel\" (\"Javel water\"), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. Another strong chlorine oxidant and bleach which he investigated and was the first to produce, potassium chlorate (KClO3), is known as Berthollet's Salt.\nBerthollet first determined the elemental composition of the gas ammonia, in 1785.\nBerthollet was one of the first chemists to recognize the characteristics of a reverse reaction, and hence, chemical equilibrium.\nBerthollet was engaged in a long-term battle with another French chemist, Joseph Proust, on the validity of the law of definite proportions. While Proust believed that chemical compounds are composed of a fixed ratio of their constituent elements irrespective of the methods of production, Berthollet believed that this ratio can change according to the ratio of the reactants initially taken. Although Proust proved his theory by accurate measurements, his theory was not immediately accepted partially due to Berthollet's authority. His law was finally accepted when Berzelius confirmed it in 1811, but it was found later that Berthollet was not completely wrong because there exists a class of compounds that do not obey the law of definite proportions.

In 1582 St Carlo Borromeo, the cardinal archbishop of Milan, ordered a canonical recognition of Simplicianus' remains who were tumulated under the major altar and then his holy relics were translated during a solemn procession to the odiern temple.\n\n\n== Notes ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Count became one of Sigismund's most powerful advisers,  and it was easy for him to obtain the bishopric of Freising for his son Hermann when it suddenly fell vacant.\nAt this time Hermann was studying in Bologna, when on 26 July 1412 Pope John XXII, on the intervention of the German emperor Sigismund, named him Bishop of Freising. As he was still too young to be consecrated a bishop, he received a papal dispensation allowing him to rule in Freising. He had to borrow 10,000 Gulden from his father to pay the annates due to the papacy. On 8 September 1413 he was anointed bishop.\nThe cathedral chapter of Freising was entirely taken by surprise by the sudden death of Bishop Konrad von Hebenstreit and the equally sudden nomination of Hermann, which prevented it from exercising its right of election.\nFrom 1414 to 1418 Hermann took part in the Council of Constance, where he represented the interests of king Sigismund. In the summer of 1419 he agreed an alliance with the bishops of the ecclesiastical province of Salzburg, under the leadership of the Archbishop, for the protection of their spiritual Immunit\u00e4tsrechte with the promise of mutual support against the territorial princes.\nBecause of their good relations with the king the family was able to persuade Pope Martin V to transfer him to the seat of the Prince-Bishop of Trent, vacant since the banishment of George of Lichtenstein in August 1419. The Papal nomination took place on 29 March 1421, but Martin V was oblige to rescind it on 13 September 1421, as the cathedral chapter of Trent were not willing to accept Hermann, because of his severe hernia. In order to regain Trent he returned to Cilli in late autumn and underwent an operation, which he did not survive.\nHe died on 13 December 1421 and was buried in the parish church of Celje, now Celje Cathedral.

Travelling through Italy he visited Vicenza, Verona, Mantua and Venice, the places where he made the longest stays. He made drawings of the Greek temples at Paestum (Loukomski 1928) and finally arrived in Rome in 1763, at a moment when Neoclassicism was being developed in advanced artistic circles. He studied painting with Anton Raphael Mengs, then with Stefano Pozzi, later moving to study architecture (1767\u201369) with a traditionalist Late Baroque architect Paolo Posi.\nThen he came upon a copy of Andrea Palladio's Quattro Libri d'archittetura. \"You could never believe,\" he wrote to his friend and long-term correspondent Marchesi, \"the impression that this book made. Then it struck me that I had every reason to consider myself badly guided\" before that point (Loukomsky 1928). He turned for new, Neoclassical instruction to Antoine Decrezet, a friend of Winckelmann, and the former's pupil Niccola Giansimoni, measuring and drawing the antiquities of Rome.\nIn Venice (1771\u20131772), where he was studying the works of Palladio, Quarenghi came into contact with a British lord passing through there on the Grand Tour. It was through him that the architect secured a few minor English commissions, such as garden pavilions, chimney pieces (Loukomsky 1928), and an altar for the private Roman Catholic chapel of Henry Arundell at New Wardour Castle. Designs for a country house for Lord Whitworth were exhibited at Venice in 1967. His first major commission (1771\u20137) was the internal reconstruction of the monastery of Santa Scholastica at Subiaco. For the Venetian cardinal Rezzonico, the nephew of Pope Clement XIII, he designed a decor for a Music Room in the Campidoglio, and designs for Clement's tomb (later executed by Antonio Canova).\nHis work in Italy and for English clients formed enough of a reputation that in 1779 he was selected by the Prussian-born count Rieffenstein, who had been commissioned by Catherine II of Russia to send her two Italian architects to replace her French ones (Loukomsky 1928). Despite having just designed a manege in Monaco and a dining hall for the Archduchess of Modena, 35-year-old Quarenghi seems to have felt himself underemployed, given the number of architects then working in Italy and the dearth of commissions from the church and nobility.

Reggi, himself a student of Tiepolo. Young Quarenghi was well-educated and widely read. Travelling through Italy he visited Vicenza, Verona, Mantua and Venice, the places where he made the longest stays. He made drawings of the Greek temples at Paestum (Loukomski 1928) and finally arrived in Rome in 1763, at a moment when Neoclassicism was being developed in advanced artistic circles. He studied painting with Anton Raphael Mengs, then with Stefano Pozzi, later moving to study architecture (1767\u201369) with a traditionalist Late Baroque architect Paolo Posi.\nThen he came upon a copy of Andrea Palladio's Quattro Libri d'archittetura. \"You could never believe,\" he wrote to his friend and long-term correspondent Marchesi, \"the impression that this book made. Then it struck me that I had every reason to consider myself badly guided\" before that point (Loukomsky 1928). He turned for new, Neoclassical instruction to Antoine Decrezet, a friend of Winckelmann, and the former's pupil Niccola Giansimoni, measuring and drawing the antiquities of Rome.\nIn Venice (1771\u20131772), where he was studying the works of Palladio, Quarenghi came into contact with a British lord passing through there on the Grand Tour. It was through him that the architect secured a few minor English commissions, such as garden pavilions, chimney pieces (Loukomsky 1928), and an altar for the private Roman Catholic chapel of Henry Arundell at New Wardour Castle. Designs for a country house for Lord Whitworth were exhibited at Venice in 1967. His first major commission (1771\u20137) was the internal reconstruction of the monastery of Santa Scholastica at Subiaco. For the Venetian cardinal Rezzonico, the nephew of Pope Clement XIII, he designed a decor for a Music Room in the Campidoglio, and designs for Clement's tomb (later executed by Antonio Canova).\nHis work in Italy and for English clients formed enough of a reputation that in 1779 he was selected by the Prussian-born count Rieffenstein, who had been commissioned by Catherine II of Russia to send her two Italian architects to replace her French ones (Loukomsky 1928). Despite having just designed a manege in Monaco and a dining hall for the Archduchess of Modena, 35-year-old Quarenghi seems to have felt himself underemployed, given the number of architects then working in Italy and the dearth of commissions from the church and nobility. He accepted Rieffenstein's offer without hesitation and left with his pregnant wife for St Petersburg.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_19952", "text": "Quarenghi's first important commission in Russia was the English Palace in Peterhof, a magnificent rectangular edifice with a Corinthian portico.

In 1783 Quarenghi settled with his family in Tsarskoe Selo, where he would supervise the construction of the Alexander Palace, the most ambitious of his undertakings to date.\nAppointed to the post of Catherine II's court architect, Quarenghi went on to produce a prodigious number of designs for the Empress, her successors and members of her court: houses, summerhouses, bridges, theatres, hospices, a market, a bank building, interior decorations and garden designs.

Thurber established the National Conservatory of Music of America in 1885\u2014the first of its kind and an endeavor that some say ushered in the first orchestral music with a distinctively American sound. But in a very radical stance for the day, Thurber championed the rights of women, people of color and the handicapped to attend her school, sometimes on full scholarship. This was 1885\u2014two decades since the end of the American Civil War\u2014and her school was racially integrated, promoted women, and had an inclusive stance toward the handicapped.\nThurber founded the school in part because of her belief that a nation should cultivate its own unique music\u2014an unusual stance when the prevailing attitude was that all cultured art, especially orchestral music, came from Germany or Italy. While running the school, she sponsored competitions for American musicians to develop American music.\n\nThe National Conservatory of Music of America was the outstanding institution for professional musical preparation in the United States for some 25 years or more. At its height in the 1890s it boasted a faculty of international renown ... and initiated a course of studies whose features became a basis for the curriculum now taken for granted in the colleges and conservatories of this country. Its achievements resulted from the endeavors of a single visionary: Jeannette M Thurber, a wealthy, idealistic New Yorker who devoted most of her life to the school ... Although her innovative design for the Conservatory was influential in shaping the course of American music for the 20th century, Mrs. Thurber and her school have slipped into undeserved obscurity.\"", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_20039", "text": "Jeannette Meyers was the daughter of Henry Meyers, an immigrant violinist from Copenhagen, Denmark, and Annamarie Coffin Price. She was educated at the Paris Conservatory, which inspired her to advocate for government funding of her school, as was done in France. On September 15, 1869, at the age of 19, she married Francis Beatty Thurber (Delhi, November 13, 1842 \u2013 Manhattan, July 4, 1907), who would later become a millionaire grocery wholesaler. The couple had two daughters, Marianne and Jeannette. The family had a summer home at Onteora Park in the Catskill Mountains.\nIn 1884 Thurber sponsored New York City's first Wagner festival. In 1885 she founded the National Conservatory of Music of America and its adjunct American Opera Company, both in New York. In 1888/89 she sponsored the New York debut of the Boston Symphony. But the Conservatory seemed to be her real love, and she grew it from 84 students when it opened to 3,000 students in 1900. Her success was due, in part, to her conviction that her school required an outstanding and publicly-celebrated faculty: its first director was Jacques Bouhy, a world-renowned baritone.In 1892, she was responsible for bringing the Czech composer Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to the United States to head her conservatory, where he remained until 1895. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, who refused her offer several times, was ultimately persuaded by his wife, Anna Dvorak, when she learned of the staggering annual salary of $15,000, which was 25 times his current income. He was to receive four months' summer leave in exchange for three hours of daily teaching and six annual concerts. It was there that he met 26-year-old African-American student Harry Burleigh. Burleigh, who mopped floors to pay for his tuition, sang spirituals as he worked and drew the interest of Dvorak. Burleigh's rendering of African-American spirituals had a profound effect on Dvorak's compositions and served as the basis for one of his best-known symphonies, (with a title suggested by Thurber, it is said), \"From the New World\". Dvorak said, \"In the Negro melodies of America I discover all that is needed for a great and noble school of music.\" Burleigh went on to assist Dvorak in copying sections of his work as his amanuensis, and ultimately became a well-known baritone and composer in his own right, as well as a faculty member at the Conservatory.\nIn addition to race and gender issues, Thurber championed the idea of a federally-funded conservatory and was very pointed about the fact that the United States was the only industrialized nation that did not provide government monies for the arts. Thurber \"precipitated public debate over the appropriateness of a federally funded Conservatory of music in a capitalist society\". In fact, the Institute of Musical Art of the City of New York, chartered in 1904 with the backing of Andrew Carnegie, was a privately funded institution and became her chief competition, and there is no indication in the public record that they accepted blacks, the handicapped or even women. The school ultimately morphed into the Juilliard School. (Carnegie also was a founding patron of Thurber's Conservatory though some research suggests that other than a small amount from L. Horton and Andrew Carnegie, Thurber is the only one who contributed financial backing.)\n\nThurber's continuing difficulties in securing funding for her school\u2014either public or private\u2014and her flagging energy as she grew older, contributed to the demise of the school, but her success did as well: music schools started springing up, competing for faculty and students.

He succeeded the pioneering work of Henri-Gustave Delvigne and Louis-\u00c9tienne de Thouvenin.\nMini\u00e9 served in a number of African campaigns with the Chasseurs, after which he was eventually promoted to captain.  In 1846 he designed the Mini\u00e9 ball, a cylindrical bullet with a conical hollow in the base which expanded when fired.  This projectile, combined with his rifle, resulted in a major improvement in firearm accuracy.\nThe French government rewarded Mini\u00e9 with some 20,000 francs and installed him as a member of the staff at the Vincennes military school. In 1858 he retired from the Imperial Russian Army with the rank of colonel and later served as a military instructor for the khedive of Egypt and as a manager at the Remington Arms Company in the United States.

That same year, his former teacher Benvenuti hired him as an assistant.\nIn 1836, he began another series of frescoes at the Palazzo Pitti, with scenes from the life of Julius Caesar. Two years later, on a commission from Prince Anatoly  Demidov, he created a large canvas depicting the discovery of King Manfred's body after the Battle of Benevento. In 1839, he decorated a lunette for the new Tribune of Galileo at the National History Museum with a scene showing Galileo experimenting with gravity.This work resulted in his becoming a professor at the Academy in 1844, to replace the late Benvenuti. During this period, he focused on commissioned portraits, including politicians such as Bettino Ricasoli, and writers such as Giuseppe Giusti. In 1853, a portrait of the recently deceased Austrian general, Julius Jacob von Haynau, created some controversy, as he had been involved in violently suppressing some of the Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states. His last exhibition was at the Exposition Universelle of 1855, where he presented several paintings with religious themes. \nAmong his pupils at the Academy were Giovanni Fattori, Giuseppe Raggio, Enrico Pollastrini, Carlo Ademollo, Giuseppe Pierotti, Stefano Ussi, Silvestro Lega, and Adeodato Malatesta; as well as the Americans William Edward West and Edwin White.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He rivals Antonio Stradivari (1644\u20131737) with regard to the respect and reverence accorded his instruments, and for many prominent players and collectors his instruments are the most coveted of all. Instruments made by Guarneri are often referred to as Del Ges\u00f9s.\nGuarneri is known as del Ges\u00f9 (literally \"of Jesus\") because his labels after 1731 incorporated the nomen sacrum, IHS (iota-eta-sigma) and a cross fleury. His instruments diverged significantly from family tradition, becoming uniquely his own style. They are considered equal in quality to those of Stradivari, and claimed by some to be superior. Guarneri's violins often have a darker, more robust, and more sonorous tone than Stradivari's. Fewer than 200 of Guarneri's instruments survive. They are all violins, although one cello bearing his father's label, dated 1731, seems to have been completed by del Ges\u00f9. The quality and scarcity of his instruments have resulted in sale prices in excess of $10 million USD.\nAn asteroid has been named 19185 Guarneri in his honour.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_20131", "text": "The most illustrious member of the house of Guarneri, Bartolomeo was the son of Giuseppe Giovanni Battista, thus the grandson of Andrea Guarneri, both noted violin makers themselves. Andrea learned his trade as an apprentice of Nicol\u00f2 Amati, to whom Stradivari was also apprenticed. Undoubtedly, Giuseppe learned the craft of violinmaking in his father's shop.\nGiuseppe Guarneri's style has been widely copied by luthiers since the 19th century. Guarneri's career is a great contrast to that of Stradivari, who was stylistically consistent, very careful about craftsmanship and finish, and evolved the design of his instruments in a deliberate way over seven decades. Guarneri's career was short, from the late 1720s until his death in 1744. Initially he was thought to be a man of restless creativity, judging by his constant experimentation with f-holes, arching, thicknesses of the top and back and other design details. However, what has become clear is that, like other members of his family, he was so commercially overshadowed by his illustrious and business-savvy neighbor, Antonio Stradivari, that he was unable to command prices commensurate with his rival, hence needed to make more instruments and work hastily. Indeed, two of the five violin makers of the Guarneri family, the two Pietros\u2014of different generations\u2014left Cremona, the first for Mantua, the second for Venice, apparently because business prospects in Cremona were so stunted by the presence of Stradivari. From the 1720s until about 1737, Guarneri's work is quick and accurate, although he was not overly concerned with quality of finish. However, from the late 1730s until his death, his work shows increasing haste and lack of patience with the time needed to achieve a high quality finish. Some of his late violins from circa 1742 to 1744 have scrolls that can be crudely carved, the purfling hastily inserted, the f-holes unsymmetrical and jagged.Nonetheless, many of these late violins, in spite of the seeming haste and carelessness of their construction, possess a glorious tone and have been much coveted by soloists. His output falls off rather dramatically in the late 1730s, and the eccentricity of the works following that period gave rise to the romantic notion that he had been imprisoned for killing a rival violin maker (actually it was one of the Lavazza brothers in Milan to whom this occurred), and even the unlikely fiction that he made violins in prison. Such stories were invented during the nineteenth century and were repeated by the biographers of the Guarneri family, the Hills, in their 1931 work; while the Hills did not take them at face-value (this is an understatement borderline misrepresentative  of what the Hills wrote p89 of The Violin-Makers of the Guarneri Family (1626\u20131762): Their Life and Work,  they treat those stories as \"gossip\" \"pretty legend\" by \"Cozio embroidered by Fetis\" \"superficial and inaccurate\" ) , it did feed into their idea that Giuseppe Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 must have been temperamental and mercurial, rather than simply overworked and commercially unsuccessful (p.91 of The Violin-Makers of the Guarneri Family (1626\u20131762): Their Life and Work  the Hills state that  IF you were to trust the stories gathered from the last  Bergonzi (not the one from Cozio) them you would have a reasonable explanation ).

There is thus the possibility that the odd qualities of finish in his later instruments\u2014ironically, those most highly prized and expensive\u2014were due not only to stress and haste but also to encroaching illness. It is also worth noting that the tone of both Stradivari and Guarneri did not come into their own until late in the 18th century, that the high-built instruments of Amati and Stainer were the only ones prized during the 18th century. While it is true that players, then as now, preferred old instruments, Stradivari made one of the handsomest livings of all violin makers during his lifetime.

At the beginning of the First Empire, his mother pleaded his cause before Napoleon, who decided to name him \u00e9cuyer (\"squire\") to Madame M\u00e8re. At the age of 29, he married the daughter of a senator, and composed a tragedy, Charlemagne, which was declined by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais. In 1811 Napoleon appointed him as a master (auditeur) at the Council of State, then as an intendant in the Spanish army. He participated in the Spanish campaign and was present at the capture of Tarragona.\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, he succeeded in ingratiating himself with Louis XVIII, who named him Master of Requests. He bought a chateau and adopted the title of viscount. In 1818, he orchestrated a huge publicity campaign for the publication of his epic poem, Charlemagne, ou la Carol\u00e9ide, and presented himself before the Academy, where his candidature obtained exactly one vote. Undiscouraged, he began work on a novel which he believed would bring him as great a reputation as Chateaubriand's.\nLe Solitaire appeared in 1821 and achieved an \"extraordinary, even colossal, celebrity.\" In the space of several months, the book was reprinted a dozen times; it was translated into ten languages; there were no fewer than seven operas based on its story, and twice as many dramatic adaptations; and it was the subject of innumerable songs, parodies, paintings and lithographs. The success of his next three novels, Le Ren\u00e9gat in 1822, Ipsibo\u00e9 in 1823, and L'\u00c9trang\u00e8re in 1825, was almost as great.\nAdulated above all by his female readership, who saw him as \"the new Ossian\", he was harpooned by critics. His plot points were judged impossible, his characters cardboard, and his imagery grotesque. His taste for syntactic inversions, with which he generously adorned his prose, led to the nickname \"the inversive Viscount\", and the result was memorably parodied in Illusions perdues by Balzac (who, nevertheless, was strongly influenced in his first works by the gothic style of d'Arlincourt). The Academic Charles-Marie de F\u00e9letz wrote that \"Le Solitaire has so far been translated into every single known language, except of course French.\" Later assessments were no more favourable. His novels, now classified as \"gothic\", were then labelled fr\u00e9n\u00e9tique: \"containing a mysterious intrigue centred on some illustrious and guilty wretch who traipses through a thousand violent incidents towards a bloody catastrophe.\"\nD'Arlincourt's vanity and egocentricity were the subject of many anecdotes, including a story of his attempts to persuade his portrait-painter, Robert Lef\u00e8vre, to make his eyes look larger and larger, until they were \"like those of an ox\"; the result was still considered unsatisfactory by his wife, who confronted the painter, turning to her husband and telling him to \"Do that thing with your eyes.\" (Mon ami, fais tes yeux.) He also posed for Jean-Baptiste Isabey.\nD'Arlincourt frequently defended himself in print, explaining that it was his goal to \"spiritualize all the impressions of existence\"; he presented a play he wrote in his youth, Le Si\u00e8ge de Paris, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais in 1826, but it was promptly torn to pieces by the critics. Not always justly: some of the most ridiculed extracts are not in fact by him.\nHe made two long journeys through Europe, in 1841 and 1844, visiting exiled princes, and on his return presented a new play, La Peste noire, which was received no more favourably than the first. In 1848, outraged by the events of June, he published Dieu le veut! (\"God wills it!\"), a pamphlet which led to legal troubles for the author but also increased his popularity. In 1850 he published L'Italie rouge, a hostile account of the Risorgimento. In the last years of his life, still \"avid for acclaim\", he was a frequent guest of salons.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Brabant has more sun and more comfort; Teniers, in consequence, is silvery and sparkling, and the people he paints are fair specimens of their culture. Holland, in the vicinity of Haarlem, seems to have suffered much from war; the air is moist and hazy, and the people depicted by Ostade are short and ill-favoured, marked with adversity's stamp in feature and dress.Brouwer, who painted the peasant in his frolics and passions, brought more of the spirit of Frans Hals into his depictions than did his colleague; but the type is the same as Ostade's. During the first years of his career, Ostade tended toward the same exaggeration and frolic as his comrade, though he is distinguished from his rival by a more general use of light and shade, especially a greater concentration of light on a small surface in contrast with a broad expanse of gloom. The key of his harmonies remained for a time in the scale of greys, but his treatment is dry and careful in a style which shuns no difficulties of detail.

He gave the magic light of a sun-gleam to their lowly sports, their quarrels, even their quieter moods of enjoyment; he clothed the wreck of the cottages with colourful vegetation.It was natural, given the tendency to effect which marked Ostade from the first, that he should have been fired by emulation to rival the masterpieces of Rembrandt. His early pictures are not so rare but that we can trace how he glided from one period to the other. Before the dispersal of the Jakob Gsell collection at Vienna in 1872, it was easy to study the steel-grey harmonies, the exaggerated caricature of his early works between 1632 and 1638.

Ostade, however, did not succeed here in giving dramatic force and expression; his shepherds were without much emotion, passion or surprise. His picture was an effect of light, and masterly as such, in its sketchy rubbings of dark brown tone relieved by strongly impasted lights, but without the very qualities which made his usual subjects attractive.In 1642 he painted the beautiful interior at the Louvre: a mother tending her cradled child, her husband sitting nearby, beside a great chimney; the darkness of a country loft dimly illumined by a sunbeam shining on the casement. One might think the painter intended to depict the Nativity; but there is nothing holy in the surroundings, nothing attractive, indeed, except the wonderful Rembrandtesque transparency, the brownish tone, and the admirable keeping of the minutest parts.

Almost innumerable are the more familiar themes to which he devoted his brush during this interval: from small single figures, representing smokers or drinkers, to allegories of the five senses (Hermitage and Brunswick galleries), half-lengths of fishmongers and bakers, cottage brawls, scenes of gambling, itinerant players and quacks, and ninepins players in the open air.\nThe humor in some of these pieces is contagious, as in the Tavern Scene of the La Caze Collection (Louvre, 1653).

Known for his dexterous bass playing and booming baritone voice, Wetton first began to gain fame in 1971 when he joined Family for a short time before joining King Crimson in 1972.After the breakup of King Crimson at the end of 1974, Wetton spent the next seven years as a member of several other progressive rock and hard rock bands, Roxy Music (1974\u20131975), Uriah Heep (1975\u20131976), U.K. (1977\u20131980) and Wishbone Ash (1980\u20131981). In 1981, he became the co-founder, singer and principal songwriter of supergroup Asia, which proved to be his biggest commercial success. The debut Asia album sold ten million copies worldwide and was Billboard magazine's number one album of 1982.\nHe later formed the duo Icon with his Asia bandmate (and songwriting partner) Geoff Downes. From the 1990s he had a successful solo career. Wetton signed his name with his left hand but played bass right-handed.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_20255", "text": "Wetton was born in Willington, Derbyshire, and grew up in Bournemouth, Dorset, where he attended Bournemouth School. His elder brother Robert was a classical organist and choirmaster, and while practising organ would have John play the bass parts on a piano, since their home organ did not have a pedalboard. Wetton recalled that during these practices, \"I got to like bass lines, because Bach bass lines are incredibly interesting. So I thought, this is good, I like bass lines, that's me.\" Though an enthusiast of classical music since childhood, he opted to go into rock and roll instead in order to avoid being compared with his brother. He played bass and sang in a number of early bands with Richard Palmer-James, including The Corvettes, The Palmer-James Group, Tetrad, and Ginger Man. A key early band was the jazzy Mogul Thrash; after live work with Renaissance, he joined Family and also did various recording sessions.Wetton's big break came when his fellow Dorset native Robert Fripp invited him to join King Crimson in late 1972. This incarnation of the band also included violinist David Cross, former Yes drummer Bill Bruford, and percussionist Jamie Muir. His time in the band would allow Wetton to come into his own as a lead singer and writer. Wetton's old friend Richard Palmer-James also worked with the band as their primary lyricist. Wetton remained with the band until Fripp unexpectedly disbanded it in 1974. King Crimson maintained their interest in improvisation throughout this period, but moved away from the classical, jazz and English folk leanings of their earlier work. The 1972\u20131974 period featured a more aggressive fusion/avant-rock sound, led by Wetton's thunderous, melodic bass lines \u2013 whose \"roaring and crunching\" sound (enhanced with effects pedals and a rotating Leslie speaker cabinet, the latter of which was traditionally used with a Hammond organ) often verged on heavy metal. Fripp once compared playing onstage with Wetton and drummer Bill Bruford to working with \"a flying brick wall\".After the dissolution of King Crimson, Wetton continued to work on various projects, including a tour with Roxy Music and two albums with Uriah Heep. While still with King Crimson, Wetton had been asked by Roxy Music to \"sit in\" on their auditions for a replacement bass player and give his recommendations; dissatisfied with all the applicants, he offered to do the 1975 tour with the group himself so as to give them time to find a good bassist. In 1977, after failed attempts to reunite King Crimson and to create a new band with Rick Wakeman, Wetton formed U.K. with his King Crimson rhythm section partner Bill Bruford. Wetton recruited Roxy Music keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson, while Bruford brought in innovative guitarist Allan Holdsworth from his solo group. U.K. adopted a more composition-driven approach than King Crimson, per Wetton's preference.After the break-up of U.K., Wetton released his first solo album, Caught in the Crossfire (1980). Later that year he had a brief stint in Wishbone Ash, appearing on their album Number the Brave (1981). In late 1981 he had a meeting with Geffen Records' boss John Kalodner who took him to task for playing bass in Bryan Ferry's backing band, feeling he should be fronting a group himself. At Kalodner's insistence, Wetton started writing with former Yes guitarist Steve Howe, with a view to forming their own band. Joined by keyboardist Geoff Downes, and drummer Carl Palmer (of Emerson, Lake & Palmer), this band would become Asia, and they produced one of the bestselling albums of the 1980s. Their self-titled debut album Asia sold over 10 million copies worldwide, making the band a household name across the globe. Wetton worked with Asia until 1983, when he was fired (at the insistence of Geffen Records) for then-unknown reasons, but at least in part due to lower-than-expected sales of the Alpha (1983) album. He returned to Asia in 1985 (with Mandy Meyer replacing Steve Howe on guitar) to complete Astra (1985).In the late 1980s, a collaboration between Wetton and Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera was released as Wetton/Manzanera (1986). Around this time, Wetton began working with Geoff Downes and Carl Palmer to restart Asia. Some of the material they recorded was featured on 1990's Then & Now CD, including a radio hit in \"Days Like These\".\nThe 1990s saw Wetton mostly focusing on his solo career. In 1999, an aborted attempt to reform Asia resulted in Wetton and Carl Palmer forming a short-lived progressive group dubbed Qango with John Young and Dave Kilminster. Qango performed several shows in the UK, and recorded a live album, Live in the Hood, before disbanding.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Wetton reunited with Geoff Downes for Icon.

After the fall of Santa Anna in the 1854-55 Revolution of Ayutla that brought the liberals to power, M\u00e1rquez supported the conservative government in the Reform War (1858\u201360) against the liberal government of Benito Ju\u00e1rez. With Miguel Miram\u00f3n, the leading general of the conservatives, M\u00e1rquez initially found success against the liberal army, but the tide turned in 1860, and the liberals won on the battle field. He was called \"The Tiger of Tacubaya\", alluding to the Battle of Tacubaya (11 April 1859) where he ordered liberal officers and some medical personnel to be executed.  M\u00e1rquez pursued guerrilla warfare in the Sierra Gorda after the defeat of the conservatives on the battlefield; he is blamed for the murders of the prominent liberals Melchor Ocampo and General Leandro Valle.In 1862, he supported the conservatives' invitation to Maximilian Hapsburg to become the emperor of Mexico, although he did not participate in conservative politicians' plans for it. He did join the French forces under General Charles de Lorencez in the initial invasion. In 1864, M\u00e1rquez was given a mission to Constantinople. Meanwhile, in Mexico, the war led by the French was turning as Liberals were starting to win back their territory and the French emperor was now considering the pros and cons of the war in general.\nIn October 1866, Maximilian made him a division commander of forces around Mexico City, but he was unaware that M\u00e1rquez was causing dissension by forced conscription (leva) of troops and exacting protection money from residents of the capital.  French general Bazaine condemned M\u00e1rquez's methods of recruitment.

With Miguel Miram\u00f3n, the leading general of the conservatives, M\u00e1rquez initially found success against the liberal army, but the tide turned in 1860, and the liberals won on the battle field. He was called \"The Tiger of Tacubaya\", alluding to the Battle of Tacubaya (11 April 1859) where he ordered liberal officers and some medical personnel to be executed.  M\u00e1rquez pursued guerrilla warfare in the Sierra Gorda after the defeat of the conservatives on the battlefield; he is blamed for the murders of the prominent liberals Melchor Ocampo and General Leandro Valle.In 1862, he supported the conservatives' invitation to Maximilian Hapsburg to become the emperor of Mexico, although he did not participate in conservative politicians' plans for it.

His older brother was Henry (Heinrich) I of Westerburg (who would be killed at the Battle of Worringen in 1288).Siegfried was consecrated Archbishop of Cologne in March 1275 in Lyon. The city of Cologne since 1268 had been under excommunication, and was therefore deemed an unsuitable place for consecration. In July 1275, as the new Archbishop of Cologne, Siegfried lifted the city\u2019s excommunication and signed a friendship treaty with the city.  In October 1279 in Pingsheim (now part of N\u00f6rvenich), he concluded the Peace of Pingsheim with the Counts of J\u00fclich. On 27 April 1285 he awarded Br\u00fchl, situated south of Cologne, town and market rights.\nAround 1283, Siegfried took the side of Count Reinoud I of Guelders in the War of the Limburg Succession. In March 1287, he led the opposition the taxation of the clergy proposed by the cardinal legate Giovanni Boccamazza at the Synod of W\u00fcrzburg. In July 1287, he freed the city of Cologne, after receiving a loyalty oath from its citizens, from paying duties to finance his war expenses in the Limburg succession conflict.\nHis involvement in the Limburg succession dispute led to the Battle of Worringen on 5 June 1288. Siegfried lost the battle, which also involved citizens from Cologne led by Gerhard Overstolzen and from Berg under the leadership of Walter Dodds. Siegfried was taken prisoner by Duke John I of Brabant and delivered over to Count Adolf VIII of Berg. After first spending a night confined in the Schelmenturm at Monheim, he was subsequently brought to Schloss Burg.\nSiegfried was released on 6 July 1289 but had fallen ill during the time of his difficult captivity. He earlier had to conclude peace treaties with the victors of Worringen on 19 May 1289. He had to pay reparations of 12,000 marks (about three tons of silver) to the Count of Berg, cede areas (among others, L\u00fcnen with all episcopal rights, Westhofen, Brackel, Werl, Menden, Isenberg, and Raffenberg) and the (sub-) Vogtship over the Diocese of Essen to Eberhard II, Count of the Mark (who thereby benefited most from the victory at Worringen), pledge the town of Deutz and some castles, and tear down other castles like Worringen, Zons, and Volmarstein. The Duchy of Limburg was occupied Duke John I of Brabant.\nAs a consequence of his defeat, on 18 June 1288 he had to recognize in a contract 'the sovereignty of the city' of Cologne. However on 18 January 1290, Pope Nicholas IV relieved him of all the promises which he had given to Cologne. On 31 January the Pope even called for the Archbishops of Mainz and Trier to help Siegfried recover the Cologne Archbishopric\u2019s possessions.\nAfter his release, the Elector preferred to make his residence in Bonn. The archbishop's mint in Cologne ceased operations and Siegfried made Bonn his new mint city. As a challenge to Cologne, he chose the name \u201cVerona\u201d for Bonn, and issued his coins with the inscription \"Beata Verona Vince\u201d (\u201cYou, Happy Verona will win\"). In 1286 Siegfrid introduced the first town constitution in Bonn. It specified that the distinguished citizens (oppidani maiores) should choose twelve suitable men, the best the city had to offer, whose decisions would be binding for the whole citizenry.\nIn the upcoming election of the King of Germany in 1292, Siegfried favored Count Adolf of Nassau, his brother-in-law, to enable the Archbishop to recover from his vast concessions. In the Treaty of Andernach on 27 April 1292, Adolf of Nassau agreed to all of Siegfried\u2019s demands, including the transfer to the Archbishopric of imperial cities like Dortmund and Duisburg, imperial castles and estates, and the Vogtship of Essen. On 5 May 1292, Siegfried saw to the successful election of Adolf of Nassau, and crowned him on 24 June 1292 in Aachen.\nSiegfrieds restoration policy, however, was doomed to fail, because of the opposition of the \"Coalition of Worringen.\" He could neither restore the link between his Rhenish and Westphalian possessions, nor re-integrate the city of Cologne into the Diocese. Because of the non-fulfillment of the requirements of the Treaty of Andernach, the kingdom of Adolf of Nassau then collapsed as well.\nSiegfried died on 7 April 1297 in Bonn and was buried in the Bonn Minster.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

He rose to power as Regent Plenipotentiary of Ethiopia (Enderase) for Empress Zewditu from 1916 until 1930. Haile Selassie is widely considered a defining figure in modern Ethiopian history, and the major figure of Rastafari, a religious movement in Jamaica that emerged shortly after he became emperor in the 1930s. Before he rose to power he defeated Ras Gugsa Welle Bitul (nephew of Empress Taytu) of Begemder at the Battle of Anchem in 1928. He was a member of the Solomonic dynasty, which claims to trace lineage to Emperor Menelik I, a legendary figure believed by the claimants to be the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, who they name as Makeda.\nHaile Selassie attempted to modernise the country through a series of political and social reforms, including the introduction of the 1931 constitution, its first written constitution, and the abolition of slavery. He led the failed efforts to defend Ethiopia during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and spent most of the period of Italian occupation exiled in the United Kingdom. In 1940, he travelled to the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to assist in coordinating the anti-fascist struggle in Ethiopia and returned to his home country in 1941 after the East African campaign. He dissolved the Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea, which was established by the UN General Assembly in 1950, and annexed Eritrea into Ethiopia as one of its provinces, while fighting to prevent secession.Haile Selassie's internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the United Nations. In 1963, he presided over the formation of the Organisation of African Unity, the precursor of the African Union, and served as its first chairman. In 1974, he was overthrown in a military coup by a Marxist\u2013Leninist junta, the Derg. On 27 August 1975, Haile Selassie was assassinated by Derg military officers, a fact that was only revealed in 1994.Among some members of the Rastafari movement, Haile Selassie is referred to as the returned messiah of the Bible, God incarnate. This distinction notwithstanding, he was a Christian and adhered to the tenets and liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. He has been criticised by some historians for his suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy (the mesafint), which consistently opposed his changes. Some critics have also criticised Ethiopia's failure to modernise rapidly enough. During his rule the Harari people were persecuted and many left the Harari Region. His administration was also criticised by human rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch, as autocratic and illiberal. Although some sources state that late during his administration the Oromo language was banned from education, public speaking and use in administration, there was never an official law or government policy that criminalised any language. The Haile Selassie government relocated numerous Amharas into southern Ethiopia where they served in government administration, courts, and church.

She claimed in interviews (and in her book No Woman, No Cry) that she saw a stigmata print on the palm of Haile Selassie's hand as he waved to the crowd, which resembled the markings on Christ's hands from being nailed to the cross\u2014a claim that was not supported by other sources, but was used as evidence for her and other Rastafari to suggest that Haile Selassie I was indeed their messiah. Rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world due to the popularity of Bob Marley.Bob Marley's posthumously released song \"Iron Lion Zion\" may refer to Haile Selassie.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He engraved and designed many prints which were published by prominent Antwerp printers such as van Meurs, the Plantin Press and Martinus van den Enden the Elder. He had a close relationship with the workshop of the leading Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens and collaborated on various projects under the direction of Rubens.  In the 1630s van Diepenbeeck started to create monumental paintings.  His work was influenced by Rubens and Anthony van Dyck.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_20437", "text": "Van Diepenbeeck was born in 's-Hertogenbosch as the son of the glass painter Jan Roelofsz. van Diepenbeeck.  The early Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken alleged that van Diepenbeeck was in Italy to study glass painting likely in the late 1610s or early 1620s. Modern scholarship has cast some doubt on this study time in Italy. It is believed that he studied with his father and left 's-Hertogenbosch for Antwerp after his father's death in 1620.  It is possible that his move from his home town in 1621 was related to the war negotiations that were underway that year, which particularly threatened the northern border provinces of the Southern Netherlands, where 's Hertogenbosch was located.\nHe was registered in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a glass painter ('gelaesschryver') in the guild year 1622\u201323. It is believed that in the years 1626-1627 he assisted,  along with the workshop of Rubens, with the cartoons for the tapestry series of The Adoration of the Eucharist.  In 1627 he designed on the instruction of Rubens drawing for the frontispiece of the book Vitae patrum. De vita et verbis seniorum, sive, Historiae eremiticae libri X. Auctoribus suis et nitori pristino nestituti, ac notationibus illustrati, opera et studio Heriberti Ros-weydi Vltraiectini, e soc. Jesu theologi published in 1628 by the Plantin Press in Antwerp. Around 1632 Rubens requested van Diepenbeeck to travel to France to make drawings after frescoes by Francesco Primaticcio (1504\u2013157) and Nicol\u00f2 dell'Abate (ca. 1509\u20131571) in Paris and Fontainebleau.\nHe became a member of the Sodality of the Unmarried Men of Age ('Sodaliteit der bejaerde jongmans') in April 1634 and a consultor of this Sodality in September 1634 and September 1636. On 4 January 1636 he was registered as a poorter (citizen) of Antwerp.  He married in June 1637 Catharina Heuvick, daughter of Luc Heuvick, notary of Antwerp and Schelle. The couple had eight children. On 13 June 1639 he became consultor of the Sodality of the Married Men of Age ('Sodaliteit der getrouwden'). He became a master painter and glass painter of the Guild of St. Luke in the Guild year 1638\u20131639. Van Diepenbeeck had his whole career great difficulties with the Guild and many of his colleagues.   He was elected, against his own wishes, to serve as the dean of the guild during the guild year 1642\u20131643. He refused to present the annual accounts of the guild for that year which were then prepared by Guillam Leestens in his stead. He employed the engraver Hendrik Snijders II on 1 September 1642.In 1648 the Antwerp painter Gonzales Coques undertook to supply a series of monumental paintings on the life of Psyche for the Huis Honselaarsdijk, a palace of the Stadtholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange (1584\u20131647). The paintings in the series were to be made after designs by van Diepenbeeck and were executed by other painters from Antwerp. As in 1652 Van Diepenbeeck had still not been paid the financial compensation for his work he filed a lawsuit against Coques.

The early Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken alleged that van Diepenbeeck was in Italy to study glass painting likely in the late 1610s or early 1620s. Modern scholarship has cast some doubt on this study time in Italy. It is believed that he studied with his father and left 's-Hertogenbosch for Antwerp after his father's death in 1620.  It is possible that his move from his home town in 1621 was related to the war negotiations that were underway that year, which particularly threatened the northern border provinces of the Southern Netherlands, where 's Hertogenbosch was located.\nHe was registered in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a glass painter ('gelaesschryver') in the guild year 1622\u201323. It is believed that in the years 1626-1627 he assisted,  along with the workshop of Rubens, with the cartoons for the tapestry series of The Adoration of the Eucharist.  In 1627 he designed on the instruction of Rubens drawing for the frontispiece of the book Vitae patrum. De vita et verbis seniorum, sive, Historiae eremiticae libri X. Auctoribus suis et nitori pristino nestituti, ac notationibus illustrati, opera et studio Heriberti Ros-weydi Vltraiectini, e soc. Jesu theologi published in 1628 by the Plantin Press in Antwerp. Around 1632 Rubens requested van Diepenbeeck to travel to France to make drawings after frescoes by Francesco Primaticcio (1504\u2013157) and Nicol\u00f2 dell'Abate (ca. 1509\u20131571) in Paris and Fontainebleau.\nHe became a member of the Sodality of the Unmarried Men of Age ('Sodaliteit der bejaerde jongmans') in April 1634 and a consultor of this Sodality in September 1634 and September 1636.

He became a master painter and glass painter of the Guild of St. Luke in the Guild year 1638\u20131639. Van Diepenbeeck had his whole career great difficulties with the Guild and many of his colleagues.

He employed the engraver Hendrik Snijders II on 1 September 1642.In 1648 the Antwerp painter Gonzales Coques undertook to supply a series of monumental paintings on the life of Psyche for the Huis Honselaarsdijk, a palace of the Stadtholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange (1584\u20131647).

Other sources say Banks was noticed by Cool Papa Bell of the Monarchs.In 1951, Banks was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in Germany during the Korean War. He served as a flag bearer in the 45th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion at Fort Bliss, where he played with the Harlem Globetrotters on a part-time basis. In 1953, he was discharged from the army and joined the Monarchs for the remainder of that season, achieving a .347 batting average. Banks later said, \"Playing for the Kansas City Monarchs was like my school, my learning, my world. It was my whole life.\" Banks hosted a program on 1450 WHFC in the late 1950s.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_20474", "text": "In 1953, after returning from military service in Germany, Banks married his first wife Mollye Ector. He proposed to her in a letter from Germany. Although he filed for divorce two years later, the couple briefly reconciled in early 1959. By that summer, they agreed on a divorce settlement that would pay $65,000 to Ector in lieu of alimony. Shortly thereafter, Banks eloped with Eloyce Johnson. The couple had twin sons within a year and a daughter four years after that. Ector filed suit against Banks in 1963 for failure to make payments on a life insurance policy agreed upon in their divorce settlement.Banks was a lifelong Republican \u2013 and he also once stated that \"I'm not goin' anywhere I'm not wanted\" \u2013 prompting critics to claim that he was \"soft\" on Jim Crow; he ran for alderman in Chicago in 1963. He ran in the 8th Ward against Democratic incumbent James A. Condon. In the Feb. 26 primary, Banks finished a distant third, garnering just 12% of the vote (Condon won re-election with 55%; Gerald Gibbons drew 25%). He later said, \"People knew me only as a baseball player. They didn't think I qualified as a government official and no matter what I did I couldn't change my image ... What I learned, was that it was going to be hard for me to disengage myself from my baseball life and I would have to compensate for it after my playing days were over.\" Banks endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004.In 1966, Banks worked for Seaway National Bank in the off-season and enrolled in a banking correspondence course. He bought into several business ventures, including a gas station, during his playing career. Though he had been paid modestly in comparison to other baseball stars, Banks had taken the advice of Wrigley and invested much of his earnings. He later spent time working for an insurance company and for New World Van Lines. Banks began building assets that would be worth an estimated $4 million by the time he was 55 years old.Banks and Bob Nelson became the first black owners of a U.S. Ford Motor Company dealership in 1967, Ernie Banks Ford on Chicago's south side. Nelson had been the first non-white commissioned officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II; he operated an import car dealership before the venture with Banks. Banks was appointed to the board of directors of the Chicago Transit Authority in 1969. On a trip to Europe, Banks visited the Pope, who presented him with a medal that became a prized possession.Banks was divorced from Eloyce in 1981. She received several valuable items from his playing career as part of their divorce settlement, including his 500th home run ball. She sold the items not long after the divorce. He remarried in 1984. In 1993, his third wife Marjorie was part of a group that met with MLB executives to discuss race relations in baseball after allegations of racial slurs surfaced against Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott. Banks married Liz Ellzey in 1997 and Hank Aaron served as his best man. In late 2008, Banks and Ellzey adopted an infant daughter.Banks's nephew, Bob Johnson, was a major league catcher and first baseman for the Texas Rangers between 1981 and 1983. His great nephew, Acie Law, is a professional basketball player who attended Texas A&M University before playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Born in Copenhagen, Denmark, he was the youngest son of the diplomat Sir Andrew Buchanan, 1st Baronet and Frances, daughter of the Very Rev Edward Mellish by Elizabeth Leigh.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_20493", "text": "Buchanan entered diplomatic service in 1876 and served as Second Secretary in Tokyo, Vienna and Bern and as Secretary in Rome. By 1899, he was serving on the Venezuelan Boundary Commission and later that year was appointed charg\u00e9 d'affaires at Darmstadt and Karlsruhe. In late 1901, he moved to Berlin, where he was appointed First Secretary at the British embassy. From 1903 to 1908, he was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Bulgaria, and in 1909, he was appointed as Minister to the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Invested with the Knight's Grand Cross of Royal Victorian Order in 1909, he was next sworn to the Privy Council. In 1910, Buchanan was appointed as the British Ambassador to Russia. He kept abreast of the political developments in Russia and met some of the leading liberal reformists in the country.\nWhen the Dardanelles were guaranteed by Germany to the Ottoman Empire, Italy sent two secret documents via the British diplomatic corps from Sir Michael Rodd to Buchanan at St Petersburg. They were the evidence that Russia needed to persuade Italy to support its Serbian policy in the Balkans. On 4 March 1915, Imperiali, the Italian envoy to London, presented the documents to Sir Edward Grey on the 16 February authority from Italian Foreign Minister Sonnino. France attached great importance to Italy's decision to join the Allies.  Buchanan brought Count Sazonov to the negotiating table.\nIt has been suggested that to have been secretly encouraged by the then Liberal government in London:\n\nThe British Ambassador George Buchanan was only too aware of the court's 'pro-German sympathies'. He complained to the Duma President, M.V. Rodzianko, in November 1916 that he found it difficult to get an audience at court, and expressed his view 'that Germany is using Alexandra Fedorovna to set the Tsar against the Allies'. Elsewhere, however, Buchanan stated his view that the Empress was 'the unwitting instrument of Germany'.\nBuchanan had developed a strong bond with Tsar Nicholas II and attempted to convince him that granting some constitutional reform would stave off revolution. Buchanan actively supported the Duma in its efforts to change Russia's stately system during wartime. Nicholas's opinion of him was under the Tsarina's sway.  Knowing that there were plots to stage a palace coup to replace him, Buchanan formally requested an audience with the Tsar in the troubled early days of 1917.  At his last meeting with Nicholas, Buchanan pleaded with him in 'undiplomatic' language: \"I can but plead as my excuse the fact that I have throughout been inspired by my feelings of devotion for Your Majesty and the Empress. If I were to see a friend walking through a wood on a dark night along a path which I knew ended in a precipice, would it not be my duty, sir, to warn him of his danger?  And is it not equally my duty to warn Your Majesty of the abyss that lies ahead of you? You have, sir, come to the parting of the ways, and you have now to choose between two paths. The one will lead you to victory and a glorious peace \u2013 the other to revolution and disaster. Let me implore Your Majesty to choose the former.\"Although the Tsar was touched by the Ambassador's devotion, he allowed his wife's malevolent attitudes to outweigh the sensible advice that he had been given. After the collapse of the autocracy (see Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia), he developed close relations with the liberal Provisional Government, which was led initially by George Lvov and later by Alexander Kerensky and was formed after the February Revolution. At the same time, Buchanan developed a fear of the dangers of Bolshevism and its growing support. He feared that the Russian Provisional Government would be toppled and tried to warn of the fragility of the government and the dangers of a Bolshevik revolution.  Buchanan had reported to London: \"They are more active and better organized than any other group, and until they and the ideas which they represent are finally squashed, the country will remain a prey to anarchy and disorder. If the Government are not strong enough to put down the Bolsheviks by force, at the risk of breaking altogether with the soviet, the only alternative will be a Bolshevik Government.\" However, after the events of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks' ascension to power, Buchanan was widely criticized for failing to ensure that Tsar and his family were evacuated from Russia before their execution by the Bolsheviks at Ekaterinburg in 1918. It is now known that was not the fault of Buchanan but that of the Tsar's first cousin, King George V, who feared revolutionary trends in Britain and the stability of his own throne and so persuaded the Lloyd George government to rescind the offer that had made to provide sanctuary for the Imperial Family.Buchanan was disappointed that the fledgling democracy offered by the Provisional Government was strangled by the Bolshevik coup.\nIn early December 1918, Buchanan fell ill and for the good of his health agreed that it was best for him to leave Russia. His family left St Petersburg on 26 December 1918 and arrived back in Leith, in Scotland, on 17 January 1919. His health soon collapsed, which forced him to spend time recovering in Cornwall.\nAfter his recovery, he was disappointed that after all of his years of service, he was not given a peerage and offered only a two-year ambassadorship in Rome. He accepted the post and served as ambassador to the Kingdom of Italy from 1919 to 1921.

By 1899, he was serving on the Venezuelan Boundary Commission and later that year was appointed charg\u00e9 d'affaires at Darmstadt and Karlsruhe. In late 1901, he moved to Berlin, where he was appointed First Secretary at the British embassy. From 1903 to 1908, he was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Bulgaria, and in 1909, he was appointed as Minister to the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Invested with the Knight's Grand Cross of Royal Victorian Order in 1909, he was next sworn to the Privy Council. In 1910, Buchanan was appointed as the British Ambassador to Russia. He kept abreast of the political developments in Russia and met some of the leading liberal reformists in the country.\nWhen the Dardanelles were guaranteed by Germany to the Ottoman Empire, Italy sent two secret documents via the British diplomatic corps from Sir Michael Rodd to Buchanan at St Petersburg. They were the evidence that Russia needed to persuade Italy to support its Serbian policy in the Balkans. On 4 March 1915, Imperiali, the Italian envoy to London, presented the documents to Sir Edward Grey on the 16 February authority from Italian Foreign Minister Sonnino. France attached great importance to Italy's decision to join the Allies.  Buchanan brought Count Sazonov to the negotiating table.\nIt has been suggested that to have been secretly encouraged by the then Liberal government in London:\n\nThe British Ambassador George Buchanan was only too aware of the court's 'pro-German sympathies'. He complained to the Duma President, M.V. Rodzianko, in November 1916 that he found it difficult to get an audience at court, and expressed his view 'that Germany is using Alexandra Fedorovna to set the Tsar against the Allies'. Elsewhere, however, Buchanan stated his view that the Empress was 'the unwitting instrument of Germany'.\nBuchanan had developed a strong bond with Tsar Nicholas II and attempted to convince him that granting some constitutional reform would stave off revolution. Buchanan actively supported the Duma in its efforts to change Russia's stately system during wartime. Nicholas's opinion of him was under the Tsarina's sway.  Knowing that there were plots to stage a palace coup to replace him, Buchanan formally requested an audience with the Tsar in the troubled early days of 1917.  At his last meeting with Nicholas, Buchanan pleaded with him in 'undiplomatic' language: \"I can but plead as my excuse the fact that I have throughout been inspired by my feelings of devotion for Your Majesty and the Empress. If I were to see a friend walking through a wood on a dark night along a path which I knew ended in a precipice, would it not be my duty, sir, to warn him of his danger?  And is it not equally my duty to warn Your Majesty of the abyss that lies ahead of you? You have, sir, come to the parting of the ways, and you have now to choose between two paths. The one will lead you to victory and a glorious peace \u2013 the other to revolution and disaster. Let me implore Your Majesty to choose the former.\"Although the Tsar was touched by the Ambassador's devotion, he allowed his wife's malevolent attitudes to outweigh the sensible advice that he had been given. After the collapse of the autocracy (see Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia), he developed close relations with the liberal Provisional Government, which was led initially by George Lvov and later by Alexander Kerensky and was formed after the February Revolution. At the same time, Buchanan developed a fear of the dangers of Bolshevism and its growing support. He feared that the Russian Provisional Government would be toppled and tried to warn of the fragility of the government and the dangers of a Bolshevik revolution.  Buchanan had reported to London: \"They are more active and better organized than any other group, and until they and the ideas which they represent are finally squashed, the country will remain a prey to anarchy and disorder. If the Government are not strong enough to put down the Bolsheviks by force, at the risk of breaking altogether with the soviet, the only alternative will be a Bolshevik Government.\" However, after the events of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks' ascension to power, Buchanan was widely criticized for failing to ensure that Tsar and his family were evacuated from Russia before their execution by the Bolsheviks at Ekaterinburg in 1918. It is now known that was not the fault of Buchanan but that of the Tsar's first cousin, King George V, who feared revolutionary trends in Britain and the stability of his own throne and so persuaded the Lloyd George government to rescind the offer that had made to provide sanctuary for the Imperial Family.Buchanan was disappointed that the fledgling democracy offered by the Provisional Government was strangled by the Bolshevik coup.\nIn early December 1918, Buchanan fell ill and for the good of his health agreed that it was best for him to leave Russia. His family left St Petersburg on 26 December 1918 and arrived back in Leith, in Scotland, on 17 January 1919. His health soon collapsed, which forced him to spend time recovering in Cornwall.\nAfter his recovery, he was disappointed that after all of his years of service, he was not given a peerage and offered only a two-year ambassadorship in Rome. He accepted the post and served as ambassador to the Kingdom of Italy from 1919 to 1921. While in Italy his wife was found to have terminal cancer and died in April 1921, soon after the family's return to England.Buchanan's autobiography, My Mission to Russia and Other Diplomatic Memories, was published in 1923.

B. Bennett.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_20514", "text": "He was born in Guelph, Canada West, the son of Donald Guthrie, and studied there and at Osgoode Hall, becoming a barrister. Guthrie was named a King's Counsel in 1902. He married Maude Henrietta, the daughter of Guelph businessman Thomas H. Scarff.\nGuthrie was first elected to the House of Commons as a Liberal in 1900 from the riding of Wellington South. He sat in Wilfrid Laurier's caucus for 17 years, but crossed the floor to join the Unionist government of Robert Borden as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1917. The former Liberal backbencher became a leading light in his new party, serving as solicitor general under Borden. With the end of World War I, most Liberal-Unionists either rejoined the Liberal Party or joined the new Progressive Party. Guthrie, however, stayed with the Conservatives, becoming minister of militia and defence and running for re-election as a Conservative in the 1921 election. After the election, he joined the Conservatives on the Opposition benches.\nAs a result of the 1926 \"King-Byng Affair\", Meighen's Conservatives formed a government in which Guthrie served as Minister of Justice and Minister of National Defence (acting until July 13). This second stint in Cabinet ended with the defeat of the Meighen government in that fall's election. Meighen lost his seat, and Guthrie served as Leader of the Opposition and interim leader of the Conservative Party for a full year.\nGuthie sought the party leadership at the leadership convention that the party held in 1927, but was defeated by R.B. Bennett. John Diefenbaker was a delegate to that convention and he wrote in his memoirs that Guthrie's candidacy was hurt when the former Liberal absent-mindedly declared in his speech to delegates that the Conservative meeting was the \"greatest Liberal convention in history\".\nBennett led the Conservatives to victory in the 1930 election, and Guthrie was appointed Minister of Justice and Attorney General. In 1931, he led the Canadian delegation to the League of Nations. In 1933, he introduced legislation making it illegal to carry a concealed weapon without authorization. In 1935, he clashed with opposition Member of Parliament Agnes Macphail who demanded an inquiry into inhumane conditions in Canada's prisons such as the whipping of prisoners.\n\nAs the Great Depression worsened and millions were unemployed, the government became increasingly concerned about political instability and the growth of radical movements. Guthrie's department was responsible for the persecution of the Communist Party of Canada, and the arrest and incarceration of Communists, including leader Tim Buck, for sedition.\nIn 1933,Tim Buck was shot at by soldiers in an apparent assassination attempt while he was in his cell during a prison riot. Guthrie was forced to admit that the attack was deliberate, but claimed the intent was only to frighten him; however, the public outcry at this incident lead to Buck being released.\nIn 1935, unemployed workers in British Columbia deserted the remote relief camps established by the Bennett government, and began the \"On to Ottawa Trek\". Thousands of unemployed workers hopped on freight trains heading east intending to converge in Ottawa and press their demands on the government. Bennett's cabinet saw this as an insurrectionary movement and panicked. In the House of Commons, Guthrie charged that the protesters \"were a distinct menace to the peace, order and good government of Canada.\"\nAs the protesters entered Saskatchewan, Guthrie had the Trek banned, over the objections of Saskatchewan Premier James G. Gardiner. He and Bennett ordered the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to use tear gas and revolvers to break up the Trek when it entered Regina.

Guthrie was named a King's Counsel in 1902. He married Maude Henrietta, the daughter of Guelph businessman Thomas H. Scarff.\nGuthrie was first elected to the House of Commons as a Liberal in 1900 from the riding of Wellington South. He sat in Wilfrid Laurier's caucus for 17 years, but crossed the floor to join the Unionist government of Robert Borden as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1917. The former Liberal backbencher became a leading light in his new party, serving as solicitor general under Borden. With the end of World War I, most Liberal-Unionists either rejoined the Liberal Party or joined the new Progressive Party. Guthrie, however, stayed with the Conservatives, becoming minister of militia and defence and running for re-election as a Conservative in the 1921 election. After the election, he joined the Conservatives on the Opposition benches.\nAs a result of the 1926 \"King-Byng Affair\", Meighen's Conservatives formed a government in which Guthrie served as Minister of Justice and Minister of National Defence (acting until July 13). This second stint in Cabinet ended with the defeat of the Meighen government in that fall's election. Meighen lost his seat, and Guthrie served as Leader of the Opposition and interim leader of the Conservative Party for a full year.\nGuthie sought the party leadership at the leadership convention that the party held in 1927, but was defeated by R.B. Bennett. John Diefenbaker was a delegate to that convention and he wrote in his memoirs that Guthrie's candidacy was hurt when the former Liberal absent-mindedly declared in his speech to delegates that the Conservative meeting was the \"greatest Liberal convention in history\".\nBennett led the Conservatives to victory in the 1930 election, and Guthrie was appointed Minister of Justice and Attorney General. In 1931, he led the Canadian delegation to the League of Nations. In 1933, he introduced legislation making it illegal to carry a concealed weapon without authorization. In 1935, he clashed with opposition Member of Parliament Agnes Macphail who demanded an inquiry into inhumane conditions in Canada's prisons such as the whipping of prisoners.\n\nAs the Great Depression worsened and millions were unemployed, the government became increasingly concerned about political instability and the growth of radical movements. Guthrie's department was responsible for the persecution of the Communist Party of Canada, and the arrest and incarceration of Communists, including leader Tim Buck, for sedition.\nIn 1933,Tim Buck was shot at by soldiers in an apparent assassination attempt while he was in his cell during a prison riot. Guthrie was forced to admit that the attack was deliberate, but claimed the intent was only to frighten him; however, the public outcry at this incident lead to Buck being released.\nIn 1935, unemployed workers in British Columbia deserted the remote relief camps established by the Bennett government, and began the \"On to Ottawa Trek\". Thousands of unemployed workers hopped on freight trains heading east intending to converge in Ottawa and press their demands on the government. Bennett's cabinet saw this as an insurrectionary movement and panicked. In the House of Commons, Guthrie charged that the protesters \"were a distinct menace to the peace, order and good government of Canada.\"\nAs the protesters entered Saskatchewan, Guthrie had the Trek banned, over the objections of Saskatchewan Premier James G. Gardiner. He and Bennett ordered the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to use tear gas and revolvers to break up the Trek when it entered Regina. The city was but under siege with hundreds of police officers moved in blocking all exits from the city.

The History employed the finest artists and critics of the period; Grabar personally wrote the issues on architecture that set an unsurpassed standard of understanding and presenting the subject. Concurrently, he wrote and published a series of books on contemporary and historic Russian painters. In 1913, he was appointed executive director of the Tretyakov Gallery and launched an ambitious reform program that continued until 1926.

Between the ages of 8 and 9, he showed precocious talent in the fields of music, poetry and painting. In 1913 he met the Futurists.\nHis attraction to the latest innovations was expressed in almost completely Futurist forms in his drawings, while he developed a unique style in his painting that was a mixture of Art Nouveau, Fauvism, Expressionism and Orphism. It was not until 1917, after meeting with Giacomo Balla in Rome, and with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in Naples (who later enthusiastically praised Conti's book Imbottigliature which was about to be printed) that Conti became part of the Futurist movement. His contribution to the movement was not only his literary works but also the paintings and drawings he produced between 1917 and 1919\u2014the years in which his work was taking on the metaphysical style.\nThe 1920s were a complex period for Conti. He explored Mannerism, Exoticism, Pittura Metafisica, and great historical and religious painting, covering a vast area that can be compared with his keen interest in the theatrical and literary world of Luigi Pirandello, Massimo Bontempelli and Enrico Pea, which led him to found the Viareggio Prize in 1929.\nThe 1930s brought a series of alternating events that created problems in his private life and led to his celebrative paintings. The decade also saw his enforced adhesion to Fascism (joining the Partito Nazionale Fascista), and his inner rebellion against it which transpired from his refusal to join Margherita Sarfatti's Novecento Italiano group and from other episodes when he stepped out of line. New prospects were only opened up to him when he became involved in designing stage sets for the opera house with the foundation of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino.\nBy the 1940s, long before the official rediscovery (20 years later) of the Futurist movement, Conti was again working on Futurist subjects and experiments. From 1948 to 1963 he followed the rules of the Order of the Franciscans, though he still continued to paint.\nMany of his works are housed in the Museo Primo Conti (Primo Conti Foundation Museum [1]) in the Villa le Coste at Fiesole (near Florence).", "hasanswer": true}]}

He was very serious with his tutoring and by 1622, at the age of seventeen, de Bruyns made a portrait of Franquart on a silver plate. Franquart also introduced de Bruyns to the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, showing the future Netherlandish sovereign the portrait de Bruyns made of her. Isabella was so impressed with the portrait that Anna was commissioned to create fifteen small paintings of the Mysteries of the Rosary, which were sent as a gift to Pope Paul V. After De Bruyns marriage to Isaac Bullart in 1628, it became much harder for her to find time to paint, but she still managed to produce a significant number of paintings over her lifetime.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In a movie short from the 1940s featuring Ray Noble and Buddy Clark (one of his most popular band singers), Ray Noble is asked by the announcer to play one of his most popular hits. He sits down at the piano and plays \"Goodnight, Sweetheart\".\nRay Noble provided music for many radio shows such as The Chase and Sanborn Hour, The Charlie McCarthy Show, Burns and Allen and On Stage with Cathy and Elliott Lewis and also guest-appeared in some of their films. He worked with Bergen for nearly fifteen years, playing the foil to McCarthy and the slow-witted Mortimer Snerd, and his orchestra appeared with Edgar Bergen in the 1942 film Here We Go Again. He also provided the orchestration for the 1942 Lou Gehrig biopic The Pride of the Yankees starring Gary Cooper.

Gegenbaur noted that the most reliable clue to evolutionary history is homology, the comparison of anatomical parts which have a common evolutionary origin.Gegenbaur had been a student of Albert von K\u00f6lliker, Rudolf Virchow, Heinrich M\u00fcller and Franz Leydig (1821\u20131908).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_20734", "text": "Carl Gegenbaur was born in W\u00fcrzburg, Bavaria in 1826, and he entered the University of W\u00fcrzburg as a student in 1845.

He did graduate work at Strasbourg and then studied under the chemist Wilhelm Ostwald at Leipzig, from which he was granted a PhD in 1893.  He worked at the USDA Bureau of Soils from 1902 to 1906 as a soil physicist. He worked at the (US) National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST) 1906\u20131937. His fields of expertise included soil physics, gas properties, acoustics, fluid mechanics, and blackbody radiation.  He is also the originator of the Buckingham \u03c0 theorem in the field of dimensional analysis.In 1923, Buckingham published a report which voiced skepticism that jet propulsion would be economically competitive with prop driven aircraft at low altitudes and at the speeds of that period.Buckingham's first work on soil physics is on soil aeration, particularly the loss of carbon dioxide from the soil and its subsequent replacement by oxygen. From his experiments he found that the rate of gas diffusion in soil was not dependent significantly on the soil structure, compactness or water content of the soil. Using an empirical formula based on his data, Buckingham was able to give the diffusion coefficient as a function of air content. This relation is still commonly cited in many modern textbooks and used in modern research. The outcomes of his research on gas transport were to conclude that the exchange of gases in soil aeration takes place by diffusion and is sensibly independent of the variations of the outside barometric pressure.\nBuckingham then worked on soil water, research for which he is now renowned. Buckingham's work on soil water is published in Bulletin 38 USDA Bureau of Soils: Studies on the movement of soil moisture, which was released in 1907. This document contained three sections, the first of which looked at evaporation of water from below a layer of soil. He found that soils of various textures could strongly inhibit evaporation, particularly where capillary flow through the uppermost layers was prevented. The second section of Bulletin 38 looked at the drying of soils under arid and humid conditions. Buckingham found evaporative losses were initially higher from the arid soil, then after three days the evaporation under arid conditions became less than under humid conditions, with the total loss ending up greater from the humid soil. Buckingham believed this occurred due to the self-mulching behaviour (he referred to it as the soil forming a natural mulch) exhibited by the soil under arid conditions.\nThe third section of Bulletin 38 contains the work on unsaturated flow and capillary action for which Buckingham is famous. He firstly recognized the importance of the potential of the forces arising from interactions between soil and water. He called this the capillary potential, this is now known as the moisture or water potential (matric potential). He combined capillary theory and an energy potential in soil physics theory, and was the first to expound the dependence of soil hydraulic conductivity on capillary potential. This dependence later came to be known as relative permeability in petroleum engineering. He also applied a formula equivalent to Darcy's law to unsaturated flow.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_20824", "text": "1887 \u2013 Graduated from Harvard with a degree in physics\n1893 \u2013 Received a Ph.D. from the University of Leipzig\n1893 \u2013 Began teaching physical chemistry and physics at Bryn Mawr College\n1897\u20131899 \u2013 Wrote a textbook on thermodynamics\n1899 \u2013 Left Bryn Mawr and worked at a mining camp in Morenci, Arizona\n1901 \u2013 Married Elizabeth Holstein in Texas\n1901 \u2013 Started as an instructor in physics at the University of Wisconsin\n1902\u20131906 \u2013 Worked at the USDA Bureau of Soils, where he wrote and published two papers on the dynamics of gas and water in soils.\n1907 \u2013 Began working at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS)\n1917, served as president of the Philosophical Society of Washington\n1918\u20131919 \u2013 Worked a stint as associate science attach\u00e9 to the U.S. Embassy in Rome\n1923 \u2013 First NBS researcher to be given independent status, meaning he was freed of all administrative duties\n1937 \u2013 Retired from the NBS at the mandatory age of 70, however continued to work there on research problems\n1940 \u2013 Died in Washington DC on April 29", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_20824", "text": "1887 \u2013 Graduated from Harvard with a degree in physics\n1893 \u2013 Received a Ph.D. from the University of Leipzig\n1893 \u2013 Began teaching physical chemistry and physics at Bryn Mawr College\n1897\u20131899 \u2013 Wrote a textbook on thermodynamics\n1899 \u2013 Left Bryn Mawr and worked at a mining camp in Morenci, Arizona\n1901 \u2013 Married Elizabeth Holstein in Texas\n1901 \u2013 Started as an instructor in physics at the University of Wisconsin\n1902\u20131906 \u2013 Worked at the USDA Bureau of Soils, where he wrote and published two papers on the dynamics of gas and water in soils.\n1907 \u2013 Began working at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS)\n1917, served as president of the Philosophical Society of Washington\n1918\u20131919 \u2013 Worked a stint as associate science attach\u00e9 to the U.S. Embassy in Rome\n1923 \u2013 First NBS researcher to be given independent status, meaning he was freed of all administrative duties\n1937 \u2013 Retired from the NBS at the mandatory age of 70, however continued to work there on research problems\n1940 \u2013 Died in Washington DC on April 29", "hasanswer": false}]}

His family had a soap-making business in the town. After he finished his secondary education at the Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium, he worked briefly as a volunteer at a newspaper in Cannstatt. He then studied German, art history, comparative literature, theater, and journalism at the universities of T\u00fcbingen, Munich, Halle, and Leipzig, receiving his doctorate in 1938 from Leipzig University.Bayer served as a reserve lieutenant in the German army, the Wehrmacht, from 1938. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, in the autumn of 1939, he applied to, and eventually, in the autumn of 1940, was accepted into the army's propaganda troops, the PK (Propagandakompanien), which were under the command of the Wehrmachtpropaganda department of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (the army's supreme command), and politically controlled by the Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. At their peak the PK comprised some 30 companies and 15,000 soldiers with backgrounds as journalists, photographers, artists, and film and radio personnel, who were charged with the task of recording their experiences and observations on the front in a form suitable for dissemination in the Nazi-controlled media.After a three-month training period, in Potsdam, Bayer served as a PK reporter from 1941 to 1945. He was stationed at first in Poland, in January 1941, and in June his unit moved to the Soviet Union, on the Eastern Front. A report he wrote on the Warsaw Ghetto, which he visited a number of times, was used as the text for a photo essay published in the Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung. Much of his work was published in military newspapers, including reports from the Soviet Union about the daily life of the German soldiers, and the impoverished condition of the Russian population. He also wrote feature articles, including humorous and satirical pieces. After a sojourn in southern Germany and Berlin from the end of 1942 to August 1943, he was assigned to a different PK unit and served as editor of the army newspaper Der Sieg (The Victory) through its closure in early 1945, part of the time while based in Warsaw.In his postwar life, Bayer avoided reference to his career as a PK war correspondent; decades later he stated obliquely that he looked back \"with deep shame\" on what he had seen and experienced in the war.Bayer spent the end of the war in an English prisoner-of-war camp in Putlos, in the vicinity of Oldenburg in Holstein, in spring to summer 1945, and while there directed the camp's theatre. Later that year, he married the journalist Elfriede Berger. The couple had one daughter but divorced a few years later. He then married another journalist, Susanne Ulrici Bayer, and had two more daughters.\nAfter the war, Bayer worked as a journalist and co-founded with comedian Werner Finck, Das Wespennest (The Wasp's Nest), Germany's first post-war satirical magazine. (The magazine ceased publication in 1949.) Bayer was a correspondent for Der Spiegel from 1947 to 1951, but during that time he also began a career as a free-lance writer. He adopted the pseudonym \"Thadd\u00e4us Troll\" in 1948, the name under which he is primarily known and chosen because he wanted his books to be on library shelves near those of his role model Kurt Tucholsky.In the ensuing years he published prolifically\u2014poems, plays, novels, short-stories, theatre criticism, and satirical essays\u2014often written in Swabian dialect. He also wrote scripts for the D\u00fcsseldorf cabaret Kom(m)\u00f6dchen, articles on wine and cookery, and a sex education book in Swabian on the model of Peter Mayle's Where Did I Come From?. His poetry was based on everyday life but had a political dimension in common with many post-war German poets. According to Wolfgang Beutin writing in A History of German Literature, Troll's playful linguistic use of dialect was simultaneously a \"confrontation with social convention and a criticism of social rigidity,\" a trait akin to concrete poetry and one which he shared with the Franconian dialect poet Fitzgerald Kusz.Although he was a supporter of the Social Democrat politicians Gustav Heinemann and Willy Brandt, Troll's approach to politics was essentially non-partisan and, like his poetry, was often playful. In 1950 he became one of the founding members of Werner Finck's Radikale Mitte (Radical Middle) party. Describing themselves as an \"Association for Combating the Deadly Seriousness of the Time\" and a \"Parody Party\", they were in favour of radicalism but opposed to extremism of both the Left and the Right. The party's symbol was a safety pin. In his later years Troll was an active campaigner for libraries and for support, pension rights, and fair publishing contracts for authors. He was one of the founders of the F\u00f6rderkreis deutscher Schriftsteller, an organization that supports and sponsors writers in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and served as its first chairman from 1968 to 1977. He also served on the executive councils and committees of Verband deutscher Schriftsteller (General Association of German Writers) and S\u00fcddeutschen Rundfunk (South German Radio). In 1978 he was elected vice-president of the German branch of PEN International.After a lengthy and severe depression, Thadd\u00e4us Troll committed suicide in his Stuttgart apartment with an overdose of sleeping pills on 5 July 1980. He was 66 years old and had planned his own funeral before his death. At his wake the mourners were served his favourite dumplings and Trollinger wine. A Dixieland band accompanied him to his grave in the Steigfriedhof cemetery in Bad-Cannstatt. He specified no lengthy graveside sermons, only the Lord's Prayer and a reading of his self-written obituary. In the year following his death, the F\u00f6rderkreis deutscher Schriftsteller established a literary award in his honour, the Thadd\u00e4us-Troll-Preis.

His family had a soap-making business in the town. After he finished his secondary education at the Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium, he worked briefly as a volunteer at a newspaper in Cannstatt. He then studied German, art history, comparative literature, theater, and journalism at the universities of T\u00fcbingen, Munich, Halle, and Leipzig, receiving his doctorate in 1938 from Leipzig University.Bayer served as a reserve lieutenant in the German army, the Wehrmacht, from 1938. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, in the autumn of 1939, he applied to, and eventually, in the autumn of 1940, was accepted into the army's propaganda troops, the PK (Propagandakompanien), which were under the command of the Wehrmachtpropaganda department of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (the army's supreme command), and politically controlled by the Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. At their peak the PK comprised some 30 companies and 15,000 soldiers with backgrounds as journalists, photographers, artists, and film and radio personnel, who were charged with the task of recording their experiences and observations on the front in a form suitable for dissemination in the Nazi-controlled media.After a three-month training period, in Potsdam, Bayer served as a PK reporter from 1941 to 1945. He was stationed at first in Poland, in January 1941, and in June his unit moved to the Soviet Union, on the Eastern Front. A report he wrote on the Warsaw Ghetto, which he visited a number of times, was used as the text for a photo essay published in the Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung. Much of his work was published in military newspapers, including reports from the Soviet Union about the daily life of the German soldiers, and the impoverished condition of the Russian population. He also wrote feature articles, including humorous and satirical pieces. After a sojourn in southern Germany and Berlin from the end of 1942 to August 1943, he was assigned to a different PK unit and served as editor of the army newspaper Der Sieg (The Victory) through its closure in early 1945, part of the time while based in Warsaw.In his postwar life, Bayer avoided reference to his career as a PK war correspondent; decades later he stated obliquely that he looked back \"with deep shame\" on what he had seen and experienced in the war.Bayer spent the end of the war in an English prisoner-of-war camp in Putlos, in the vicinity of Oldenburg in Holstein, in spring to summer 1945, and while there directed the camp's theatre. Later that year, he married the journalist Elfriede Berger. The couple had one daughter but divorced a few years later. He then married another journalist, Susanne Ulrici Bayer, and had two more daughters.\nAfter the war, Bayer worked as a journalist and co-founded with comedian Werner Finck, Das Wespennest (The Wasp's Nest), Germany's first post-war satirical magazine. (The magazine ceased publication in 1949.) Bayer was a correspondent for Der Spiegel from 1947 to 1951, but during that time he also began a career as a free-lance writer. He adopted the pseudonym \"Thadd\u00e4us Troll\" in 1948, the name under which he is primarily known and chosen because he wanted his books to be on library shelves near those of his role model Kurt Tucholsky.In the ensuing years he published prolifically\u2014poems, plays, novels, short-stories, theatre criticism, and satirical essays\u2014often written in Swabian dialect. He also wrote scripts for the D\u00fcsseldorf cabaret Kom(m)\u00f6dchen, articles on wine and cookery, and a sex education book in Swabian on the model of Peter Mayle's Where Did I Come From?. His poetry was based on everyday life but had a political dimension in common with many post-war German poets. According to Wolfgang Beutin writing in A History of German Literature, Troll's playful linguistic use of dialect was simultaneously a \"confrontation with social convention and a criticism of social rigidity,\" a trait akin to concrete poetry and one which he shared with the Franconian dialect poet Fitzgerald Kusz.Although he was a supporter of the Social Democrat politicians Gustav Heinemann and Willy Brandt, Troll's approach to politics was essentially non-partisan and, like his poetry, was often playful. In 1950 he became one of the founding members of Werner Finck's Radikale Mitte (Radical Middle) party. Describing themselves as an \"Association for Combating the Deadly Seriousness of the Time\" and a \"Parody Party\", they were in favour of radicalism but opposed to extremism of both the Left and the Right. The party's symbol was a safety pin. In his later years Troll was an active campaigner for libraries and for support, pension rights, and fair publishing contracts for authors. He was one of the founders of the F\u00f6rderkreis deutscher Schriftsteller, an organization that supports and sponsors writers in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and served as its first chairman from 1968 to 1977. He also served on the executive councils and committees of Verband deutscher Schriftsteller (General Association of German Writers) and S\u00fcddeutschen Rundfunk (South German Radio). In 1978 he was elected vice-president of the German branch of PEN International.After a lengthy and severe depression, Thadd\u00e4us Troll committed suicide in his Stuttgart apartment with an overdose of sleeping pills on 5 July 1980. He was 66 years old and had planned his own funeral before his death. At his wake the mourners were served his favourite dumplings and Trollinger wine. A Dixieland band accompanied him to his grave in the Steigfriedhof cemetery in Bad-Cannstatt. He specified no lengthy graveside sermons, only the Lord's Prayer and a reading of his self-written obituary. In the year following his death, the F\u00f6rderkreis deutscher Schriftsteller established a literary award in his honour, the Thadd\u00e4us-Troll-Preis.

He later retired from the army as a kapten. Together with Claes Egnell, Willie Grut and Gustaf Lindh he competed in the 1948 Winter Olympics in the winter pentathlon, which was contested as a demonstration event. As an excellent skier, he won both the downhill and the 10 km cross country disciplines, but lagged behind in shooting, fencing and horse riding. He finished third overall and won the bronze medal. Fellow countrymen Lindh and Grut took the first and second place respectively.Since the winter pentathlon would have no other appearances at the Olympic Games, Haase turned to the modern pentathlon. He was selected for the 1956 Summer Olympics and finished 17th individually. In the team contest Sweden was the favourite as it included Bj\u00f6rn Thofelt and the individual Olympic champion Lars Hall. In the first event, horse riding, Thofelt had drawn the lot for a very peculiar horse and eventually suffered from a concussion, after he fell off twice and had to withdraw. Consequently, the Swedish team was not ranked.Hasse was also successful at the world championships. He won the team title in 1950, with Lars Hall and Thor Henning, and placed third in 1954, with \u00c5ke Julin and Thofelt. Haase's home club was Studenternas Idrottsf\u00f6rening Stockholm. He completed an engineering study at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm with a focus on metallurgical and then worked in the metallurgical industry in Fagersta, where he resided until his death in July 2014.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

These views were expressed in his A Vindication of Natural Society (1756). He criticised the actions of the British government towards the American colonies, including its taxation policies. Burke also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority, although he opposed the attempt to achieve independence. He is remembered for his support for Catholic emancipation, the impeachment of Warren Hastings from the East India Company, and his staunch opposition to the French Revolution.\nIn his Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of \"good\" society and traditional institutions of state and society, and he condemned the persecution of the Catholic Church that resulted from it. This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the Whig Party which he dubbed the Old Whigs as opposed to the pro\u2013French Revolution New Whigs led by Charles James Fox.In the 19th century, Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals.

He was the founder of both the Missionaries of Saint Charles (also known as the Scalabrinians) and the Mission Sisters of Saint Charles.Scalabrini's rise to the rank of bishop came at a rapid pace due to a series of lectures he gave on the First Vatican Council in 1872 and his staunch dedication to catechism, which led Pope Pius IX to dub him the \"Apostle of the Catechism\"; successive popes Leo XIII and Pius X held him in high esteem and both failed to convince him to accept appointments as head of an archdiocese or as a cardinal. He made five pastoral visits across his diocese which proved to be an exhaustive but effective mission of evangelization and his efforts at reforming seminaries and pastoral initiatives earned him praise even from the secular detractors who criticized him for his strict obedience to the pope.His tenure as bishop resulted in the establishment of the \"Saint Raphael Association\" dedicated to the care of Italian migrants. This solidified through the actions of his twin religious congregations and his visits to both Brazil and the United States, where he went to meet Italian immigrants. He also dealt with the Paolo Miraglia-Gulotti schism that took place in his diocese and had known the faux-bishop after ordaining him in 1879. Scalabrini also held three important episcopal gatherings in his diocese that revitalized parish and diocesan practices and made his diocese the ground for the first-ever National Catechetical Congress in 1899; he was in the process of planning another before his death that was later celebrated in 1910.Scalabrini's holiness was renowned across the Italian peninsula and there were countless who attested to his saintliness in an ensuing canonization process; his first title at the outset of the process was that of a Servant of God that Pope Pius XI bestowed upon him on 30 June 1926 while the confirmation of his heroic virtue allowed for Pope John Paul II to title him as Venerable on 16 March 1987.

After practising some time at Nemours, he abandoned law, took holy orders, and was appointed tutor to one of Richelieu's nephews, the duc de Fronsac. This patronage secured for him the abbeys of Aubignac and of Mainac. The death of the duc de Fronsac in 1646 put an end to hopes of further preferment, and Ambroise Par\u00e9d'Aubignac retired to Nemours, occupying himself with literature till his death.He energetically participated in the literary controversies of his time. Against Gilles M\u00e9nage he wrote T\u00e9rence justifi\u00e9 (1656); he laid claim to having originated the idea of the Carte de tendre of Mlle de Scud\u00e9ry's Cl\u00e9li\u00e9; and after being a professed admirer of Corneille, he turned against Corneille for having neglected to mention the abb\u00e9 in his Discours sur le po\u00e8me dramatique. He was the author of four tragedies: La Cyminde (1642), La Pucelle d'Orl\u00e9ans (1642), Z\u00e9nobie (1647) and Le Martyre de Sainte Catherine (1650). Z\u00e9nobie was written with the intention of affording a model in which the strict rules of the drama, as understood by the theorists, were served.In choosing subjects for his plays, d'Aubignac seems to have been guided by a desire to illustrate the various kinds of tragedy\u2014patriotic, antique and religious themes. In return, the dramatic authors whom he was in the habit of criticizing were quick to take advantage of the opportunity for retaliation offered by the production of these plays.It is as a theorist that d'Aubignac is still remembered. The credit of having been the first to play so large a part in the history of the French stage belongs to Jean Chapelain; but the laws of dramatic method and construction generally were codified by d'Aubignac in his Pratique du th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The book was only published in 1657, but he had begun writing it under Richelieu's urging as early as 1640.\nHis Conjectures acad\u00e9miques ou dissertation sur l'Iliade d'Hom\u00e8re, which was not published until nearly forty years after his death, threw doubts on the existence of Homer, and anticipated in some sense the conclusions of Friedrich August Wolf in his Prolegomena ad Homerum (1795).The contents of the Pratique du th\u00e9\u00e2tre were summarized by Ferdinand Bruneti\u00e8re in his notice of d'Aubignac in the Grande Encyclop\u00e9die.

Like his brothers John F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy, he was a prominent member of the Democratic Party and is an icon of modern American liberalism.Kennedy was born into a wealthy, political family in Brookline, Massachusetts. After serving in the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1944 to 1946, Kennedy returned to his studies at Harvard University, and later received his law degree from the University of Virginia. He began his career as a correspondent for The Boston Post and as a lawyer at the Justice Department, but later resigned to manage his brother John's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1952. The following year, he worked as an assistant counsel to the Senate committee chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He gained national attention as the chief counsel of the Senate Labor Rackets Committee from 1957 to 1959, where he publicly challenged Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa over the union's corrupt practices. Kennedy resigned from the committee to conduct his brother's successful campaign in the 1960 presidential election. He was appointed United States attorney general at the age of 35, one of the youngest cabinet members in American history. He served as his brother's closest advisor until the latter's assassination in 1963.His tenure is known for advocating for the civil rights movement, the fight against organized crime and the Mafia, and involvement in U.S. foreign policy related to Cuba. He authored his account of the Cuban Missile Crisis in a book titled Thirteen Days. As attorney general, he authorized the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference on a limited basis. After his brother's assassination, he remained in office during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson for several months. He left to run for the United States Senate from New York in 1964 and defeated Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating, overcoming criticism that he was a \"carpetbagger\" from Massachusetts. In office, Kennedy opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and raised awareness of poverty by sponsoring legislation designed to lure private business to blighted communities (i.e., Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration project). He was an advocate for issues related to human rights and social justice by traveling abroad to eastern Europe, Latin America, and South Africa, and formed working relationships with Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, and Walter Reuther.\nIn 1968, Kennedy became a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the presidency by appealing to poor, African American, Hispanic, Catholic, and young voters. His main challenger in the race was Senator Eugene McCarthy. Shortly after winning the California primary around midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, allegedly in retaliation for his support of Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War.

He studied violin and piano at the Naples Conservatory as a teenager, and then joined an operetta troupe with which he toured Italy and the Middle East. The music publisher Giulio Ricordi allegedly heard him and advised him to undergo vocal instruction with Luigi Mancinelli, one of Italy's leading conductors.\nAccording to some sources, Anselmi's first appearance on stage in an operatic role happened as early as 1896, when he sang Turiddu (Cavalleria rusticana) in Greece. His Italian operatic debut took place in Genoa in 1900, and his career took off quickly from there. He appeared initially at the Teatro San Carlo, Naples, in late December of that year and, in 1901, at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London. Engagements at La Scala, Milan, and the Monte-Carlo Opera ensued in 1904 and 1908, respectively.

These 850 words, together with its five combinatory rules, were designed to do the work of some 20,000 English words, which appealed to many of the leading communications philosophers and theorists of the time, including Otto Neurath and Willard C. Brinton. To promote Basic English, Ogden in 1927 founded the Orthological Institute, from orthology, the abstract term he proposed for its work (see orthoepeia). Its headquarters were on King's Parade in Cambridge. From 1928 to 1930 Ogden set out his developing ideas on Basic English and Jeremy Bentham in Psyche.In 1929 the Orthological Institute published a recording by James Joyce of a passage from a draft of Finnegans Wake. In summer of that year Tales Told of Shem and Shaun had been published, an extract from the work as it then stood, and Ogden had been asked to supply an introduction.

A controversial literary figure of the early and mid-twentieth century, he was the earliest and most enthusiastic representative and promoter of Italian pragmatism. Papini was admired for his writing style and engaged in heated polemics. Involved with avant-garde movements such as futurism and post-decadentism, he moved from one political and philosophical position to another, always dissatisfied and uneasy: he converted from anti-clericalism and atheism to Catholicism, and went from convinced interventionism \u2013 before 1915 \u2013 to an aversion to war. In the 1930s, after moving from individualism to conservatism, he finally became a fascist, while maintaining an aversion to Nazism.\nAs one of the founders of the journals Leonardo (1903) and Lacerba (1913), he conceived literature as \"action\" and gave his writings an oratory and irreverent tone. Though self-educated, he was an influential iconoclastic editor and writer, with a leading role in Italian futurism and the early literary movements of youth. Working in Florence, he actively participated in foreign literary philosophical and political movements such as the French intuitionism of Bergson and the Anglo-American pragmatism of Peirce and James. Promoting the development of Italian culture and life with an individualistic and dreamy conception of life and art, he acted as a spokesman for Roman Catholic religious beliefs.\nPapini's literary success began with Il crepuscolo dei filosofi (\"The Twilight of the Philosophers\"), published in 1906, and his 1913 publication of his autobiographical novel Un uomo finito (\"A finished man\").\nDue to his ideological choices, Papini's work was almost forgotten after his death, although it was later re-evaluated and appreciated again: in 1975, the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges called him an \"undeservedly forgotten\" author.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_21071", "text": "Born in Florence as the son of a modest furniture retailer (and former member of Giuseppe Garibaldi's Redshirts) from Borgo degli Albizi, Papini was baptized in secret by his mother to avoid the aggressive anti-clericalism of his father.

A follower of Thelema, the new religious movement established by the English occultist Aleister Crowley, she was married to rocket pioneer and fellow Thelemite Jack Parsons.\nBorn in Belle Plaine, Iowa, Cameron volunteered for service in the United States Navy during the Second World War, after which she settled in Pasadena, California. There she met Parsons, who believed her to be the \"elemental\" woman that he had invoked in the early stages of a series of sex magic rituals called the Babalon Working. They entered into a relationship and were married in 1946. Their relationship was often strained, although Parsons sparked her involvement in Thelema and occultism. After Parsons' death in an explosion at their home in 1952, Cameron came to suspect that her husband had been assassinated and began rituals to communicate with his spirit. Moving to Beaumont, she established a multi-racial occult group called The Children, which dedicated itself to sex magic rituals with the intent of producing mixed-race \"moon children\" who would be devoted to the god Horus. The group soon dissolved, largely because many of its members became concerned by Cameron's increasingly apocalyptic predictions.\nReturning to Los Angeles, Cameron befriended the socialite Samson De Brier and established herself within the city's avant-garde artistic community. Among her friends were the filmmakers Curtis Harrington and Kenneth Anger. She appeared in two of Harrington's films, The Wormwood Star and Night Tide, as well as in Anger's film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. In later years, she made appearances in art-house films created by John Chamberlain and Chick Strand. Rarely remaining in one place for long, during the 1950s and 1960s she lived in Joshua Tree, San Francisco and Santa Fe. In 1955, she gave birth to a daughter, Crystal Eve Kimmel. Although intermittent health problems prevented her from working, her art and poetry resulted in several exhibitions. From the late 1970s until her death from cancer in 1995, Cameron lived in a bungalow in West Hollywood, where she raised her daughter and grandchildren, pursued her interests in esotericism, and produced artwork and poetry.\nCameron's recognition as an artist increased after her death, when her paintings made appearances in exhibitions across the U.S. As a result of increased attention on Parsons, Cameron's life also gained greater coverage in the early 2000s.

He attended Adrian College and enlisted at thirteen in the Sixteenth Regiment of the Michigan Volunteer Infantry in the Army of the Potomac during the American Civil War. At Gaines' Mill, a musket ball struck him in the breast; he was taken prisoner and held for six weeks at Libby Prison before being exchanged. Later he served at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, and, after re-enlisting in 1864, took part in the Petersburg campaign. Over three years, from 1862 to 1865, he was wounded five times, and rose to the rank of major by the time he was seventeen. His two brothers both died in the war. He graduated from the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and was admitted to the bar.\nHe set up practice in Hastings, Nebraska, in 1872 and was a member of the Nebraska constitutional convention of 1875. He was elected as a Republican to fill the newly created 2nd district seat to the U.S. House of Representatives to the Forty-eighth United States Congress. He supported the moderate coinage of silver and favored revision of the high protective tariff, but not to the extent that would make him support either the Morrison tariff bill of 1886 or the Mills tariff bill of 1888. In that respect, he stayed safely in the good graces of the national party, and beat Democratic challengers easily, even with Prohibition third party candidates carrying somewhere between three and ten percent of the vote in a congressional race. As a member of the Military Affairs Committee, he pushed through a bill to make provision for homes for disabled soldiers in every state in the Union. He also served on the Pensions committee. As one senator said later, \"No ex-soldier ever appealed to him in vain, and his generous nature could refuse nothing to the suffering or dependent.\" Breaking with other members of the Republican party, Laird strove to clear the name of General Fitz John Porter, who had been his old commanding general. \"There was in his voice the sound of the ring of the saber,\" Congressman Byron Cutcheon of Michigan commented, \"there was in his utterances the rattle of small arms in battle.\" Certainly one fellow congressman had cause to feel so that summer, when Laird took out a grievance by socking him in the mouth.He was re-elected three times serving from March 4, 1883, but after his re-election in 1888 had a nervous breakdown, complicated by insomnia; as a result, he never took his seat in the lame-duck session of the Fiftieth Congress and had no chance to attend the Congress that followed it. He died on August 17, 1889, in Hastings, aged 40. Laird is buried in Hastings' Parkview Cemetery.\nLaird is the namesake of the community of Laird, Colorado.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Nauhtla was a border city of the Aztec Empire, the garrison there exerting Aztec dominion over the local population, who were largely Totonac in ethnic origin. The province had only recently been added to the Aztec Empire through conquest, and when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s arrived in the region (now the Mexican state of Veracruz) in 1519, one of his first acts was to overthrow Aztec dominion by seizing Aztec tribute collectors in the town of Quiahuiztlan and only returning them after a personal request from the Aztec Emperor. He then routed the Aztec garrison at the town of Tizapancingo and returned the state to the native Totonacs under their leader Tlacochcalcatl of Cempoala.To restore the province to Aztec control, Moctezuma despatched Qualpopoca with instructions to defeat the Totonacs and their Spanish allies. Arriving in October 1519, Qualpopoca demanded that the Totonac towns pay their regular tribute to the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. The towns appealed to the Spanish garrisons at Villa Rica and Veracruz and Juan de Escalante, the conquistador then in command, warned Qualpopoca not to threaten the Totonacs and demanded gold as recompense. Qualpopoca took no notice and continued to organise reprisals against Totonac villages that had not paid tribute. Escalante counterattacked with an army of conquistadors and Totonac warriors and met Qualpopoca in a battle near Nauhtla.The battle was short, the Totonac forces routing early on and Escalante forced to withdraw under heavy attack, leaving Nauthla in flames. During the retreat, Escalante was mortally wounded, five Spaniards were killed and one, Juan de Arg\u00fcello, captured. As was traditional in Aztec society, Arg\u00fcello and the captured Totonacs were sacrificed, the Spaniard's head being sent to Moctezuma as a trophy.

The presence of the Spanish and their traditional enemies the Tlaxcalans caused unease in the city, especially following their massacre of the population of Cholula a few weeks earlier.

Nauhtla was a border city of the Aztec Empire, the garrison there exerting Aztec dominion over the local population, who were largely Totonac in ethnic origin. The province had only recently been added to the Aztec Empire through conquest, and when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s arrived in the region (now the Mexican state of Veracruz) in 1519, one of his first acts was to overthrow Aztec dominion by seizing Aztec tribute collectors in the town of Quiahuiztlan and only returning them after a personal request from the Aztec Emperor. He then routed the Aztec garrison at the town of Tizapancingo and returned the state to the native Totonacs under their leader Tlacochcalcatl of Cempoala.To restore the province to Aztec control, Moctezuma despatched Qualpopoca with instructions to defeat the Totonacs and their Spanish allies. Arriving in October 1519, Qualpopoca demanded that the Totonac towns pay their regular tribute to the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. The towns appealed to the Spanish garrisons at Villa Rica and Veracruz and Juan de Escalante, the conquistador then in command, warned Qualpopoca not to threaten the Totonacs and demanded gold as recompense. Qualpopoca took no notice and continued to organise reprisals against Totonac villages that had not paid tribute. Escalante counterattacked with an army of conquistadors and Totonac warriors and met Qualpopoca in a battle near Nauhtla.The battle was short, the Totonac forces routing early on and Escalante forced to withdraw under heavy attack, leaving Nauthla in flames. During the retreat, Escalante was mortally wounded, five Spaniards were killed and one, Juan de Arg\u00fcello, captured. As was traditional in Aztec society, Arg\u00fcello and the captured Totonacs were sacrificed, the Spaniard's head being sent to Moctezuma as a trophy.

After the Continuation War Virolainen moved to Lohja, but he remained one of the leaders of the evacuated Karelians, and never gave up the hope that Soviet Union and later Russia would return Finnish Karelia to Finland. After World War II Virolainen became the first president of the Maaseudun Nuorten Liitto later known as Finnish Centre Youth, which has been educating tens of ministers and hundreds of members of the Finnish Parliament.He was also famous as a teetotaller, saying that the only circumstance where he would countenance downing a toast would be if Karelia was ceded back to Finland. He was fond of repeating the line, and it has been claimed that he said it to, among others, Nikita Khrushchev and Anastas Mikoyan on the Soviet side, to fend off needling by them for lacking the Soviet style of social graces.\nA member of the Agrarian League (later the Centre Party), Virolainen was a Member of Parliament 1945\u20131983 and 1987\u20131991.He had a long ministerial career, serving as Assistant Minister of the Interior 1950\u20131951; Minister at the Council of State Chancellery 1951, and 1956\u20131957; Minister of Education 1953, 1954, 1956\u20131957, and 1968\u20131970; Minister of Foreign Affairs 1954\u20131956, 1957, and 1958; Deputy Prime Minister 1957, 1958, 1962\u20131963, 1968\u20131970, and 1977\u20131979; Minister of Agriculture 1961\u20131963; Minister of Finance 1972\u20131975; and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry 1976\u20131979.Virolainen was Prime Minister from 1964\u20131966, presiding over a coalition government comprising the Centre Party, National Coalition Party, Swedish People's Party, and Finnish People's Party. He also served as Speaker of the Parliament from 1966\u20131968 and 1979\u20131983. Virolainen is considered one of the strongest Centre Party leaders in the post-war era, second only to Urho Kekkonen.\nVirolainen had a variable, often tense relationship with President Kekkonen, who considered him an unreliable, too frequently opinion-changing politician (Juhani Suomi, \"A Ski Trail Being Snowed In:  Urho Kekkonen 1976-1981\" / Umpeutuva latu.  Urho Kekkonen 1976-1981, Helsinki:  Otava Publishing Ltd., 2000).  Virolainen himself claimed that the two basic reasons for their tense relationship were that he had never been a member of the right-wing, nationalist Academic Karelia Society (Kekkonen had, until 1932), and that he was a teetotaller (Kekkonen drank and at times smoked).  Moreover, Kekkonen was unconvinced that Virolainen always supported his official foreign policy toward the Soviet Union.  In June 1979, he publicly rebuked Virolainen, who was then Speaker of Parliament, for \"bearing a false testimony\" about Finland's foreign policy, and for harming Finland's international relations.  Shortly before this harsh accusation, Virolainen had suggested in an interview by the Suomen Kuvalehti magazine that the National Coalition Party had remained in the opposition despite its major victory in the 1979 parliamentary elections because of \"general reasons\" or foreign policy.\nAfter Kekkonen resigned in October 1981, Virolainen became the Centre Party's presidential candidate, but he was handily defeated in the 1982 presidential elections by the Social Democratic candidate, Mauno Koivisto.  In the 1983 parliamentary elections, Virolainen was one of the major-party deputies to lose their seats because of allegations that he had illegally received the parliamentary daily allowance for commuting between Helsinki and his official hometown.  Determined to finish his parliamentary career in style, he was re-elected to Parliament in the 1987 parliamentary elections.  During his last electoral term, Virolainen supported constitutional amendment proposals that reduced the President's power.During his nine-year retirement from Parliament, Virolainen still actively followed the Finnish political affairs and sometimes gave interviews on current topics (the Finnish broadcasting corporation YLE \"Living Archives\" / El\u00e4v\u00e4 arkisto, search words:  \"Johannes Virolainen\").  He also wrote some volumes of political memoirs, including \"A Defence of Politics\" (Politiikan puolustus), \"From the Path\" (Polun varrelta), and \"The Pictures Move\" (Kuvat kulkevat).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_21271", "text": "Virolainen Cabinet\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_21271", "text": "Virolainen Cabinet\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

Dellenback's defeat is largely attributed to the anti-Republican mood of the electorate in the wake of the Watergate scandal.\nAfter leaving Congress, Dellenback was appointed by President Gerald Ford as director of the Peace Corps, where he served from 1975 to 1977. From 1977 to 1988, Dellenback was president of the Christian College Coalition (now called the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities.Dellenback died in Medford, Oregon of viral pneumonia in 2002.To date, he is the last Republican to serve as representative from Oregon\u2019s 4th congressional district.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Also referred to as the \"romanticist on the throne\", he was deeply religious and believed that he ruled by divine right. He feared revolutions, and his ideal state was one governed by the Christian estates of the realm rather than a constitutional monarchy.\nIn spite of his conservative political philosophy, he initially pursued a moderate policy of easing press censorship, releasing political prisoners and reconciling with the Catholic population of the kingdom. During the German revolutions of 1848\u20131849, he was initially forced to accommodate the people's revolutionary sentiments, although he rejected the title of Emperor of the Germans offered by the Frankfurt Parliament in 1849, believing that it did not have the right to make such an offer. In December 1848 he dissolved the Prussian National Assembly when he found its constitutional proposals too radical. At the urging of his ministry, which wanted to prevent a renewal of unrest, he imposed a constitution with a parliament and a strong monarch. He then used the Prussian military to help put down revolutionary forces throughout the German Confederation.\nFrederick William IV had an artistic nature and an interest in architecture. He extended the building ensembles of the Berlin-Potsdam Residence Landscape, Museum Island, and the cultural landscape of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley, and he supported the completion of the Cologne Cathedral.

He was the son and successor of Marinus I.\nAt the beginning of his reign, he warred against the Saracens and then made a treaty with them after they appeared beneath his walls in 929. He then allied with Lombards Atenulf III of Benevento, with whom he signed a pact, and Landulf I, joint-prince of Benevento, against the Byzantines. A Greek force was sent to Apulia and the rebellious vassals were constrained to recognise the authority of the emperor in Constantinople. John then confirmed a treaty with the princes salve fidelitate sanctorum imperatorum.\nIn 946, he allied with Landulf II of Benevento in an invasion of Salerno with the intent of deposing Prince Gisulf I. They were defeated by an army of Mastalus I of Amalfi and John retired to Naples. Landulf turned around and joined with Gisulf in attacking the Neapolitan duchy. They took Nola.\nIn 949, John made a donation to the church of Saints Severinus and Sossus, which had possibly been founded by one of his predecessors. In 950, he himself founded the church of Saint Michael Porta Nova in Naples. In 955, he attempted again to throw off the imperial yoke and again an army was sent to Italy under the strategos of Calabria and Langobardia, Marianos Argyros. Refused entry into Naples, it landed in the harbour and pillaged the city, forcing John to submit. In 962, however, John switched his allegiance to the new emperor in the West, Otto I. In 958, Naples was subject to another Muslim siege.\nJohn's wife was the Roman senatrix Theodora, daughter of the famous Theodora and Theophylact I, Count of Tusculum. John was thus related by marriage to the famed Marozia. He sent his son Landulf to be raised in Rome by Marozia. His sister Orania married Docibilis II of Gaeta, cementing alliance between Gaeta and Naples. His elder son, Marinus, would succeed him in Naples. In 944, Marinus was appointed co-duke, and, in that same year, Odo of Cluny visited and influenced John to affirm the possessions of the monasteries in his domains.\nJohn was a man of letters and an amateur philosopher. He and Theodora commissioned the archpriest Leo to go to Constantinople as ambassador and bring back as many Greek manuscripts as possible. Leo returned with the Chronographia of Theophanes, the Antiquities of the Jews by Flavius Josephus, De Prodigiis by Livy, the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and the Historia Alexandri Magni. After Theodora's death, John took to reading and theorising, contemplation and translation into Latin, according to Leo.\nAn interesting anecdote is told of this duke by Peter Damian. The legend probably dates from 981 and may have basis in historical fact. In a vision, John saw a group of devils leading a line of horses drawing carts full of hay for the purpose of burning Pandulf Ironhead, the deceased prince of Capua, and himself, still very alive. John decided then and there to abdicate, but only with the permission of the Emperor Otto II first. This he died before receiving.", "hasanswer": true}]}

From 1908 to 1923, he was president of the Reichsbank and his signature appears on German Reichsbank notes from 1908 to 1923.\nHavenstein played an important part in the hyperinflationary process in Germany since he subscribed to the widespread belief then present in Germany that the inflation was caused by the fall in the external value of the mark against foreign currencies and that the role of the Reichsbank was to print sufficient money to sustain the higher price levels.  The more money that was printed the higher the price level became, so the Reichsbank then printed even more money and so on.  In other words, rather than following the Quantity Theory of Money in ascribing inflation to the excessive printing of money, Havenstein believed that money had to be printed to feed the rising demand for money within the German economy as prices were driven up by the fall in the exchange rate.  It was Havenstein's death in November 1923 that helped to bring this policy to an end and, with it, the hyperinflation.Havenstein was involved in the introduction of war bonds at the beginning of the First World War.\nHe died in Berlin and is buried in St. Anne's Cemetery in Berlin-Dahlem.", "hasanswer": true}]}

De Ner\u00e9e's literary writing and art work was very much inspired by decadent and symbolist authors such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine or Gabriele d'Annunzio, and artists as de Feure, Goya, Johan Thorn Prikker, and Jan Toorop. He more and more focused on his art. Only posthumously, in 1916, two poems were publiced in a French periodical.\nIn 1901, the Ner\u00e9e worked in Madrid for Foreign Affairs He caught TBC, a disease that would determine his further life. In Madrid De Ner\u00e9e was visited by his friend Henri van Booven, the future biographer of Louis Couperus, who later gave a thinly veiled report of this visit in his novel Een liefde in Spanje ('A Love in Spain', 1928). De Ner\u00e9e also inspired Van Booven to write his volume of (prose) poems Witte Nachten ('White Nights', 1901) and the novel Tropenwee ('Tropical Agony', 1904), the latter being a Conrad-like report of his traumatic visit to the Belgian Congo.\nIn his turn Van Booven gave De Ner\u00e9e The Early Work (1899) by Aubrey Beardsley. This was obviously great influence  on De Ner\u00e9e's style of drawing.  Later, around 1904-1905, he developed his own unique style. The themes, usually 'femmes fatales' or clownesque figures, gold nuances and symbolism of these works often recall associations with the best wor He is one of the few 'decadent' Dutch representatives of the European symbolist movement.During his life he did not exhibit; he was a well-known society figure. Sometimes he gave friends drawings and around 1905 he sold several works to mainly German collectrots. \nDue to his poor health, drawing and painting became ever more difficult after 1906-1907. The little known works from his later period are characterized by their colors and modernist compositions. He died on 19 October 1909 at 29 years of age, in the southern German town of Todtmoos. He was buried in Clarens, near Montreux.\nThe nature of his work, the Beardsley-replication and the somewhat 'decadent' character, set de Ner\u00e9e naturally in a somewhat isolated position in art history.

In 1914-1915, he informed the German government about Lenin\u00b4s plans and intended to use Bolshevik agitation to replace the Russian empire with a number of national states. Some earlier scholarship expressed skepticism, but other research has indicated that between 200,000 - 500,000 German Reichsmark was passed to Lenin by Germany using Kesk\u00fcla as a conduit.\nMichael Futrell interviewed Kesk\u00fcla whilst researching his book 1958-63. Here, Futrell records that although Kesk\u00fcla had only minimal contact with Lenin, he nevertheless passed money to him through another Estonian, Arthur Siefeldt, who drip fed the money into Bolsheviks hands by making a series of small secret donations. Other researches claim Kesk\u00fcla had given the Germans little of substance and he did not deliver any significant sums to the Bolsheviks.In 1918, he founded the Estonian Office in Stockholm to seek the support of the Entente states for Estonian independence. He acted in such status, until the official Estonian delegation forbade him to do that. The Estonian delegation was skeptical about Kesk\u00fcla and considered him a German agent.\nCentral in Kesk\u00fcla's thought was the region of Baltic Sea. According to Kesk\u00fcla's approach, Estonia had originally belonged to the Nordic region, but as a result of the German conquest in the 13th century it was included in the alien Central European cultural space. It then re-established its Nordic heritage in the 16-17th centuries and in the 18th century fell under the yoke of the even more alien Eastern European (Russian) sphere. Kesk\u00fcla thought that Estonia should separate from Russia and restore its place among the Nordic countries that were becoming increasingly unified.\nIn his later years, Kesk\u00fcla acted as the teacher of politics for several young Spanish scientists.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

He participated in several competitions and was active primarily in residential construction.\nIn 1911 Karplus was sworn in as Imperial Royal court expert and appraiser and became construction director of a building construction company in Vienna, a position he held until the liquidation of the company in 1927. In the First World War Karplus was first commissioned as a lieutenant and then as a captain, involved in the establishment of military utility buildings.In 1927, Arnold Karplus established his independent architectural studio. One of his better known works was the Ditteshof communal apartment complex built in 1928/29 in Vienna's 19th district. It consisted of 279 apartments around a landscaped courtyard and included shops, a nursery, a bathhouse and a community hall. From 1934 to 1938 his son Gerhard Karplus joined the studio.\nWith the occupation and annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, Arnold and Else Karplus moved to New York in 1939, following their son Gerhard and their daughter Ruth.

His monograph \"Triode and tetrode microwave frequency generators\" was awarded the Stalin Prize of the 3rd degree in 1952 and published also in German and Chinese.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Neiman proposed the new principle for broadband antennas free from the reflection phenomena and called \"antennas of smooth radiation\", and also the new method of calculating the power and radiation resistance of metallic antennas based on the calculation of emission of electrons moving in metal. He generalized the theory of contours and lines on the vibrational, channelizing and emitting electromagnetic microwave systems, which became the basis for the design of a wide class of microwave systems (monograph \"A generalization of the theory of chains on the wave systems\"). He developed the theory of transverse joints in waveguide systems, proposed a number of methods for design and analysis of triode, tetrode, pentode, klystron, platinotron, magnetron and reznatron amplifiers and oscillators, carried out studies of surface electromagnetic waves. In the book \"Automatic processes and phenomena\" he proposed a number of original provisions of the general theory of automatic processes. Also conducted several studies in the field of computer science: explored theoretical issues of radiopulse fast discrete automation systems, stated principal considerations for the automation of research, automation of programming of ultrafast computing systems.\nIn 1964-65, Neiman published original ideas and principal considerations of radical miniaturization on elements for recording, storing and retrieving of digital information to the molecular-atomic level, including the use of structures similar to DNA molecules.\nSimilar ideas were also expressed by the American scientists R.F. Feynman and N. Wiener. Practical applications of using artificial DNA to store large amounts of information appeared only in the late 20th - early 21st century (see DNA digital data storage for more details).\nIn 1966-67, Neiman generalized negentropy principle of information to digital data processing systems, and defined the relation restrictions between their speed and energy level of the functioning of their elements. He made a number of fundamental assumptions of the theory of extracting information from the objective processes, identified the cause of her contradictions and paradoxes. Also he worked on the history and prospects of development of radioelectronics.\nNeiman published over 90 scientific papers, including six books and textbook for higher school, which was released in two editions. For fruitful scientific, pedagogical and social activities, Neiman was awarded the Order \"Badge of Honor\" (1953) and three medals, in 1962 he was awarded the title \"Honored Personality of Science and Technics of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

He joined the Admiralty, where with a team of mathematicians and engineers he was charged with developing sonar, to detect midget submarines, and new types of mines.\nIn 1947, Crosfield founded J F Crosfield Ltd. (later Crosfield Electronics Ltd.) to develop press control equipment, beginning with the Autotron, that enabled magazines to print economically in colour.  Following this, the company played a leading role in the introduction of colour scanning in 1958, phototypesetting and later the automated composition of pages incorporating pictures and text, a 1970s precursor to Photoshop.  He founded Crosfield Business Machines Ltd in 1966 to develop and produce banknote inspection, counting and sorting machines. The companies won 4 Queens Awards for Technology and Exports.

He installed an electron-microscope in his studio, using it to scan and image microscopic insect and plant life from his garden. He used these images as the inspiration for surreal but fascinating paintings.\nCrosfield was noted for his generosity, giving away most of the fruits of his success in his lifetime.

In 1941 the family was evacuated deep into the USSR and returned in 1945. In 1947, he finished school and dreamed of becoming an actor, particularly a cinema actor. He had to accept, however, his awkwardness in such things and so chose another direction: physics. In 1947, Gribov enrolled in the Physical Faculty of Leningrad University, graduating in 1952 with diploma cum laude.Despite his ability, the official antisemitism of the time meant he was only able to find employment as a physics teacher at an evening school for adults, a job with low prestige and salary. He spent two years doing this, but in 1954, after Stalin's death, he joined the Ioffe Institute in Leningrad (then called the Physical-Technical Institute, PTI), and soon became the de facto leader of the theoretical department.In the late 1950s, he participated in Lev Landau's famous weekly seminars in Moscow, where he met Isaak Pomeranchuk, whom he greatly admired and with whom he collaborated intensely. When the PTI theory department where Gribov worked, became a part of the Leningrad Institute for Nuclear Physics (LNPI) in 1971, Gribov became a leader of a seminar on quantum field theory and elementary particle physics.

In 1941 the family was evacuated deep into the USSR and returned in 1945. In 1947, he finished school and dreamed of becoming an actor, particularly a cinema actor.

In 1947, Gribov enrolled in the Physical Faculty of Leningrad University, graduating in 1952 with diploma cum laude.Despite his ability, the official antisemitism of the time meant he was only able to find employment as a physics teacher at an evening school for adults, a job with low prestige and salary. He spent two years doing this, but in 1954, after Stalin's death, he joined the Ioffe Institute in Leningrad (then called the Physical-Technical Institute, PTI), and soon became the de facto leader of the theoretical department.In the late 1950s, he participated in Lev Landau's famous weekly seminars in Moscow, where he met Isaak Pomeranchuk, whom he greatly admired and with whom he collaborated intensely.

In Berlin he could not reach a postdoctoral lecturer qualification because of his Jewish origin, so he became a private lecturer (Privatdozent) for political science and international law in Heidelberg.\nBut his inclinations to journalism soon won the upper hand, and, his living assured by his family, he gave up teaching.He was very much taken by the questions surrounding the movements of 1848.  His feeble attempts at practical politics nevertheless foundered and left him more and more to make himself known through his pen and his theories.  He spoke at the agitated mass meeting at Unter den Zelten where the legislature's petition to the king regarding the wishes of the people was discussed.  He became one of the chief editors, with Arnold Ruge and Eduard Meyen, of \u201cDie Reform\u201d (The Reform) which soon came under the oversight of several democratic groups. Among his other co-workers on this paper were Mikhail Bakunin, Karl Heinzen and Georg Herwegh. Oppenheim sought a seat in the National Assembly. He thought it sufficient to refer to his writings in \u201cDie Reform\u201d where he developed his premise \u201cthat only with freedom did the people become mature enough for freedom,\u201d but the people of Berlin had no patience with a candidate who campaigned only with his pen. This experience convinced him even more he that he was suited to a writing career, as he did not seem suited to speaking.He went to Baden and, looking for secrets, broke into the private files of the departed archduke.  Lorenzo Brentano, the leader of the provisional government, put him in charge of the government newspaper, the \u201cKarlsruher Zeitung\u201d.  When a schism broke out between Brentano's moderates and Gustav Struve's terrorists, Oppenheim worked for the latter, and was dismissed from the newspaper when they failed.  He then traveled to Switzerland, France, the Netherlands and England. He returned in 1850 and continued to publish works on democratic ideas.  He denounced the democrats for the victories of the Reaction, but thought the latter were ultimately to blame because they turned to raw despotic power rather than continuing with their phony constitutionalism.In 1861 Oppenheim joined the German Progress Party and edited the Yearbook for Politics and Literature which was banned soon afterwards. He also became a member of the Congress of German Economists, as he was known as an excellent economist and supporter of free trade. He also paid attention to social matters.\nThe occurrences of 1866 worked a great transformation in Oppenheim.  He greeted the new order with joy while other liberals were more skeptical.  Oppenheim joined the National Liberals and supported Bismarck's strategy for national unification. He wrote two flyers for the elections, one of which only saw limited distribution since the leaders saw it as too radical.  After 1870, for the first time he directly discussed practical questions, writing on poor laws and economics.  He was also critical of \u201cfanciful thinkers about the future among the teachers in the universities.\u201dIn the 1874 election, he was elected Member of the Reichstag representing Reu\u00df \u00e4. L. and took his seat as an expert on the 1869 changes to commercial regulations.  In 1877 he lost his seat to a social democrat.  In reaction to Bismarck's protectionist policy he split with his party in 1880.\nOppenheim's philosophical work is concentrated on parliamentarism the idea of common welfare.

Inspired by the work of Sappho, Barney began publishing love poems to women under her own name as early as 1900. Writing in both French and English, she supported feminism and pacifism. She opposed monogamy and had many overlapping long and short-term relationships, including on-and-off romances with poet Ren\u00e9e Vivien and courtesan Liane de Pougy and longer relationships with writer \u00c9lisabeth de Gramont and painter Romaine Brooks. \nBarney hosted a salon at her home in Paris for more than 60 years, bringing together writers and artists from around the world, including many leading figures in French, American, and British literature. Attendees of various sexualities expressed themselves and mingled comfortably at the weekly gatherings. She worked to promote writing by women and hosted a \"Women's Academy\" (L'Acad\u00e9mie des Femmes) in her salon as a response to the all-male French Academy. The salon closed for the duration of World War II while Barney lived in Italy with Brooks. She initially espoused some pro-fascist views, but supported the Allies by the end of the war. After the war, she returned to Paris, resumed the salon, and continued influencing or inspiring writers such as Truman Capote.\nBarney had a wide literary influence. Remy de Gourmont addressed public letters to her using the nickname l'Amazon (the Amazon), and Barney's association with both de Gourmont and the nickname lasted until her death.

As a professional baseball player, his major league career spanned from 1899 to 1914 in which he played mainly in the National League for seven teams over 12 seasons. His most notable time was with the New York Giants, where he starred in the outfield for John McGraw's 1904 pennant winners and 1905 World Series champions. One of the finest hitters of the dead-ball era, his .333 career batting average ranks 28th all time and he finished in the top three in batting five times. In each of those same seasons, he also finished in the top ten in the league in on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and home runs.\nDonlin, who was given the nickname \"Turkey Mike\" for his unique strut, was a controversial character\u2014 his entertaining personality, flamboyant style of dress, and prodigious talent as a hitter caused him to be lionized as \"the baseball idol of Manhattan.\" However, alcoholism led to friction with club officials and incarceration. Donlin attempted to leverage his popularity as an athlete to launch a career in Broadway theatre where he met and married vaudeville comedian Mabel Hite in 1906. Together, they performed in the baseball-themed play Stealing Home for about three years.\nBetween the waning popularity of the play in 1911 and Hite's death the following year, Donlin attempted short-lived comebacks with the Giants, Boston Rustlers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. His forays into acting cut short an undeniable talent that could have been a much more successful major league career; he reached 100 games in just five of his major league seasons. After convincing McGraw to sign him for the last time in 1914, Donlin endured a disappointing 35-game cameo with the Giants, leading him to devote his efforts to launch his acting career.

His name is sometimes written Lansberg, and his first name is sometimes given as Philip or  Johannes Philippus.  He published under the Latin name Philippus Lansbergius.\nHe is best known as the author of a set of astronomical tables, Tabulae motuum coelestium perpetu\u00e6, for predicting planetary positions.  These were later found to contain certain errors, in part because he (erroneously) did not accept Kepler's discovery of elliptical orbits. He served as a Protestant clergyman.\nMartinus Hortensius was one of his students, and Landsberge subsequently collaborated with his former pupil.\nHe was born in Ghent in modern-day Belgium in 1561. He grew up in France and studied in England. After the Fall of Antwerp in 1585, he moved to the northern part of the Netherlands. He stayed in Leiden for a short time, and then he went to Goes to become a preacher. Lansbergen lived there until 1613. In that year, he was fired because he did not agree with a mayoral election. The fifty-two-year-old Lansbergen decided to move to Middelburg to devote himself to astronomical research, which he did until the end of his life.\nLansbergen supported the heliocentric theory of Copernicus, who claimed that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This theory was controversial in both Catholic and Protestant circles, where the geocentric theory had been more widely held.\nHe married Sara Lievaerts in 1586 and they had six sons and four daughters. He had a great reputation, because of his rare knowledge and expertise. Not only in matters of the church, but even more in mathematics and physics. In 1611, his son Pieter (1587) became a preacher in Goes. Jacob, another son, moved to Goes as well, but became a medical doctor. Lansbergens' oldest son, also called Philippus, was a preacher in Kloetinge and died there in 1647.\nLansbergen wrote several books. One of those, \"Considerations about the daily and yearly movements of the Earth\", became a best-seller. One could say that Lansbergen was the first Dutch author that wrote a popular book about the movements of the planets around the Sun.\nKepler and Galileo, who lived in the same period, were very interested in the work of Lansbergen. Based on his tables, they could predict the movements of the planets more accurately.Lansbergen probably lived in the \"Spanjaardstraat\" in Middelburg. He had frequent contacts with sympathizers, like the Dutch poet Jacob Cats. Cats wrote three poems about the \"very wise, famous, and honored Philippus Lansbergen\".\nHe died in Middelburg in December 1632.\nThe Philippus Lansbergen Public Observatory in Middleburg is named after him, and so is the lunar crater Lansberg.", "hasanswer": true}]}

His career initially developed in an inverse pattern to that of his close friend Philip Larkin. Before becoming known as a poet, Larkin had published two novels; Amis originally sought to be a poet and turned to novels only after publishing several volumes of verse. He continued throughout his career to write poetry in a straightforward, accessible style that often masks a nuance of thought.\nAmis's first novel, Lucky Jim (1954), satirises the highbrow academic set of an unnamed university through the eyes of a struggling young lecturer of history. It was widely perceived as part of the Angry Young Men movement of the 1950s, in reacting against stultification of conventional British life, although Amis never encouraged this interpretation. Amis's other novels of the 1950s and early 1960s likewise depict contemporary situations drawn from his experience.\nThat Uncertain Feeling (1955) features a young provincial librarian (perhaps with an eye to Larkin working as a librarian in Hull) and his temptation to adultery. I Like It Here (1958) takes a contemptuous view of \"abroad\", after Amis's own travels on the Continent with a young family. Take a Girl Like You (1960) steps away from the immediately autobiographical, but remains grounded in the concerns of sex and love in ordinary modern life, tracing a young schoolmaster's courtship and ultimate seduction of the heroine.\nWith The Anti-Death League (1966), Amis begins to show some of the experimentation \u2013 in content, if not style \u2013 that marked much of his work in the 1960s and 1970s. His departure from the strict realism of his early comedic novels is not so abrupt as it might first appear. He had been avidly reading science fiction since a boy and developed that interest in the Christian Gauss Lectures of 1958, while visiting Princeton University. These were published that year as New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction, giving a serious yet light-handed treatment of what the genre had to say about man and society.\nAmis was especially keen on the dystopian works of Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth, and in New Maps of Hell coined the term \"comic inferno\" to describe a type of humorous dystopia exemplified by the work of Robert Sheckley. He further displayed his devotion to the genre in editing, with the Sovietologist Robert Conquest, the science-fiction anthology series Spectrum I\u2013V, which drew heavily upon 1950s numbers of the magazine Astounding Science Fiction.\nThough not explicitly science fiction, The Anti-Death League takes liberties with reality not found in Amis's earlier novels. It introduces a speculative bent that continued to develop in others of his genre novels, such as The Green Man (1969) (mystery/horror) and The Alteration (1976) (alternative history). Much of this speculation concerned the improbability of the existence of any benevolent deity involved in human affairs.\nIn The Anti-Death League, The Green Man, The Alteration and elsewhere, including poems such as \"The Huge Artifice: an interim assessment\" and \"New Approach Needed\", Amis showed frustration with a God who could lace the world with cruelty and injustice, and championed the preservation of ordinary human happiness \u2013 in family, in friendships, in physical pleasure \u2013 against the demands of any cosmological scheme. Amis's religious views appear in a response reported in his Memoirs. To the Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko's question, \"You atheist?\", Amis replied, \"It's more that I hate Him.\"\nDuring this time, Amis had not turned completely away from the comedic realism of Lucky Jim and Take a Girl Like You. I Want It Now (1968) and Girl, 20 (1971) both depict the \"swinging\" atmosphere of late-1960s London, in which Amis certainly participated, though neither book is strictly autobiographical. Girl, 20, for instance, is set in the world of classical (and pop) music, in which Amis had no part. The book's noticeable command of music terminology and opinion shows Amis's amateur devotion to music and almost journalistic capacity to explore a subject that interested him. That intelligence is similarly displayed in the ecclesiastical matters in The Alteration; Amis was neither a Roman Catholic nor a devotee of any church.\nThroughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Amis regularly produced essays and criticism, principally for periodical publication. Some were collected in 1968 into What Became of Jane Austen? and Other Essays, in which Amis's wit and literary and social opinions were displayed on books such as Colin Wilson's The Outsider (panned), Iris Murdoch's d\u00e9but novel Under the Net (praised), and William Empson's Milton's God (inclined to agreement). Amis's opinions on books and people tended to appear, and often were, conservative, and yet, as the title essay of the collection shows, he was not merely reverent of \"the classics\" and of traditional morals, but more disposed to exercise his own rather independent judgement in all things.\nAmis became associated with Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, which he admired, in the late 1960s, when he began composing critical works connected with Bond, either under a pseudonym or uncredited. In 1965, he wrote the popular James Bond Dossier under his own name. The same year, he wrote The Book of Bond, or, Every Man His Own 007, a tongue-in-cheek how-to manual about being a sophisticated spy, under the pseudonym \"Lt Col. William ('Bill') Tanner\", Tanner being M's chief of staff in many of Fleming's novels. In 1968 Amis wrote Colonel Sun, which was published under the pseudonym \"Robert Markham\".\nAmis's literary style and tone changed significantly after 1970, with the possible exception of The Old Devils, a Booker Prize winner. Several critics found him old-fashioned and misogynistic. His Stanley and the Women, an exploration of social sanity, could be said to instance these traits. Others said that his output lacked his earlier work's humanity, wit and compassion.\nThis period also saw Amis as an anthologist, displaying a wide knowledge of all kinds of English poetry. The New Oxford Book of Light Verse (1978), which he edited, was a revision of an original volume done by W. H. Auden. Amis took it in a markedly new direction: Auden had interpreted light verse to include \"low\" verse of working-class or lower-class origin, regardless of subject matter, while Amis defined light verse as essentially light in tone, though not necessarily simple in composition. The Amis Anthology (1988), a personal selection of his favourite poems, grew out of his work for a London newspaper, in which he selected a poem a day and gave it a brief introduction.Amis was shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times, for Ending Up (1974) and Jake's Thing (1978), and finally, as prizewinner, for The Old Devils in 1986.In 2008, The Times ranked Amis 13th on its list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_21629", "text": "Kingsley Amis was born on 16 April 1922 in Clapham, south London, the only child of William Robert Amis (1889\u20131963), a clerk \u2013 \"quite an important one, fluent in Spanish and responsible for exporting mustard to South America\" \u2013 for the mustard manufacturer Colman's in the City of London, and his wife Rosa Annie (n\u00e9e Lucas).

He continued throughout his career to write poetry in a straightforward, accessible style that often masks a nuance of thought.\nAmis's first novel, Lucky Jim (1954), satirises the highbrow academic set of an unnamed university through the eyes of a struggling young lecturer of history. It was widely perceived as part of the Angry Young Men movement of the 1950s, in reacting against stultification of conventional British life, although Amis never encouraged this interpretation. Amis's other novels of the 1950s and early 1960s likewise depict contemporary situations drawn from his experience.\nThat Uncertain Feeling (1955) features a young provincial librarian (perhaps with an eye to Larkin working as a librarian in Hull) and his temptation to adultery. I Like It Here (1958) takes a contemptuous view of \"abroad\", after Amis's own travels on the Continent with a young family. Take a Girl Like You (1960) steps away from the immediately autobiographical, but remains grounded in the concerns of sex and love in ordinary modern life, tracing a young schoolmaster's courtship and ultimate seduction of the heroine.\nWith The Anti-Death League (1966), Amis begins to show some of the experimentation \u2013 in content, if not style \u2013 that marked much of his work in the 1960s and 1970s. His departure from the strict realism of his early comedic novels is not so abrupt as it might first appear. He had been avidly reading science fiction since a boy and developed that interest in the Christian Gauss Lectures of 1958, while visiting Princeton University. These were published that year as New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction, giving a serious yet light-handed treatment of what the genre had to say about man and society.\nAmis was especially keen on the dystopian works of Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth, and in New Maps of Hell coined the term \"comic inferno\" to describe a type of humorous dystopia exemplified by the work of Robert Sheckley. He further displayed his devotion to the genre in editing, with the Sovietologist Robert Conquest, the science-fiction anthology series Spectrum I\u2013V, which drew heavily upon 1950s numbers of the magazine Astounding Science Fiction.\nThough not explicitly science fiction, The Anti-Death League takes liberties with reality not found in Amis's earlier novels. It introduces a speculative bent that continued to develop in others of his genre novels, such as The Green Man (1969) (mystery/horror) and The Alteration (1976) (alternative history). Much of this speculation concerned the improbability of the existence of any benevolent deity involved in human affairs.\nIn The Anti-Death League, The Green Man, The Alteration and elsewhere, including poems such as \"The Huge Artifice: an interim assessment\" and \"New Approach Needed\", Amis showed frustration with a God who could lace the world with cruelty and injustice, and championed the preservation of ordinary human happiness \u2013 in family, in friendships, in physical pleasure \u2013 against the demands of any cosmological scheme. Amis's religious views appear in a response reported in his Memoirs. To the Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko's question, \"You atheist?\", Amis replied, \"It's more that I hate Him.\"\nDuring this time, Amis had not turned completely away from the comedic realism of Lucky Jim and Take a Girl Like You. I Want It Now (1968) and Girl, 20 (1971) both depict the \"swinging\" atmosphere of late-1960s London, in which Amis certainly participated, though neither book is strictly autobiographical. Girl, 20, for instance, is set in the world of classical (and pop) music, in which Amis had no part. The book's noticeable command of music terminology and opinion shows Amis's amateur devotion to music and almost journalistic capacity to explore a subject that interested him. That intelligence is similarly displayed in the ecclesiastical matters in The Alteration; Amis was neither a Roman Catholic nor a devotee of any church.\nThroughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Amis regularly produced essays and criticism, principally for periodical publication. Some were collected in 1968 into What Became of Jane Austen? and Other Essays, in which Amis's wit and literary and social opinions were displayed on books such as Colin Wilson's The Outsider (panned), Iris Murdoch's d\u00e9but novel Under the Net (praised), and William Empson's Milton's God (inclined to agreement). Amis's opinions on books and people tended to appear, and often were, conservative, and yet, as the title essay of the collection shows, he was not merely reverent of \"the classics\" and of traditional morals, but more disposed to exercise his own rather independent judgement in all things.\nAmis became associated with Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, which he admired, in the late 1960s, when he began composing critical works connected with Bond, either under a pseudonym or uncredited. In 1965, he wrote the popular James Bond Dossier under his own name. The same year, he wrote The Book of Bond, or, Every Man His Own 007, a tongue-in-cheek how-to manual about being a sophisticated spy, under the pseudonym \"Lt Col. William ('Bill') Tanner\", Tanner being M's chief of staff in many of Fleming's novels. In 1968 Amis wrote Colonel Sun, which was published under the pseudonym \"Robert Markham\".\nAmis's literary style and tone changed significantly after 1970, with the possible exception of The Old Devils, a Booker Prize winner. Several critics found him old-fashioned and misogynistic. His Stanley and the Women, an exploration of social sanity, could be said to instance these traits. Others said that his output lacked his earlier work's humanity, wit and compassion.\nThis period also saw Amis as an anthologist, displaying a wide knowledge of all kinds of English poetry. The New Oxford Book of Light Verse (1978), which he edited, was a revision of an original volume done by W. H. Auden. Amis took it in a markedly new direction: Auden had interpreted light verse to include \"low\" verse of working-class or lower-class origin, regardless of subject matter, while Amis defined light verse as essentially light in tone, though not necessarily simple in composition. The Amis Anthology (1988), a personal selection of his favourite poems, grew out of his work for a London newspaper, in which he selected a poem a day and gave it a brief introduction.Amis was shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times, for Ending Up (1974) and Jake's Thing (1978), and finally, as prizewinner, for The Old Devils in 1986.In 2008, The Times ranked Amis 13th on its list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In fact, a number of other Europeans had already learned to roll a kayak, but Pawlata is widely credited with the feat.\nBorn 19 February 1900 in Vienna, Pawlata had a passion for paddling the faltbooten or folding kayaks that were popular in Europe after World War I. He studied written accounts of the kayaks and skills of the Greenlandic Inuit, especially the work of Knud Rasmussen, Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen. From his research, he designed a folding kayak which he believed was \"purebred\" and more faithful to the original Arctic boats. The 4.9 metre long kayak was built for him by the firm of Otto Hartel in Graz, and he called it \"Aijuk\". On 30 July 1927, on the Weissensee, he publicly demonstrated his ability to capsize his kayak and right it again without leaving the cockpit. The method he devised, which involved gripping the far end of the paddle blade, is now known as the Pawlata roll and is still used as a training or sea kayaking technique. In the following year, he published a book called \"Kipp kipp hurra! Im reinrassigen Kajak. Eine ausf\u00fchrliche Anleitung zum Sichwiederaufrichten im Kajak (Faltboot)\" (\"Tip tip hooray! In a purebred kayak. A detailed manual for righting oneself in a kayak (folding kayak)\") In it he says:\n\n\"Quite contrary to the expectations of the old experienced paddler, on 30 July 1927, I succeeded as the first European sportsman to right himself again after capsizing in a kayak. Thus was the curse of the centuries-old Eskimo secret broken and kayaking ceased to exist in name only.\"Actually, a number of European missionaries and explorers had previously learned how to roll from the Inuit of Greenland, Paul Egede probably being the first in the 1730s. Rolling was demonstrated in 1889 at Sandviken, Norway by Oluf Dietrichson, a member of Nansen's 1888 Greenland expedition.Pawlata died in Vienna on 13 December 1966.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

Gaynor was that great rarity in American political history: a judge who actually believed in the Bill of Rights. When he sat on the bench in Brooklyn he tried to enforce it to the letter, to the natural scandal of his brethren of the ermine. Scarcely a day went by that he did not denounce the police for their tyrannies. He turned loose hundreds of prisoners, raged and roared from the bench, and wrote thousands of letters on the subject, many of them magnificent expositions of Jeffersonian doctrine.  Unfortunately, his strange ideas alarmed the general run of respectable New Yorkers quite as much as they alarmed his fellow judges, and so he was always in hot water. When Tammany, with sardonic humor, made him mayor, he began an heroic but vain effort to give New York decent government....In the end, worn out and embittered by the struggle, he died unlamented, and today political historians scarcely mention him. Yet he was a great political philosopher and a great soul. It is the tragedy of the Republic that such men are so few, and that their efforts, when they appear, go for so little.\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

He went to study law in Toulouse.\nIn 1887\u20131888, at the instigation of Laurent Tailhade, Gheusi worked on the revue Le D\u00e9cadent, but his literary career struggled to take off, despite the recommendations of \u00c9mile Zola and Catulle Mend\u00e8s.\nGheusi was involved in republican politics and joined the electoral campaign of Jaur\u00e8s in the legislative elections of 1889 in Castres. In the following years, the government called on his services from time to time. In 1897, Ernest Constans sent him on an inspection tour of Christian schools in Palestine. After a short period at the Minist\u00e8re des Colonies in 1906, beside Georges Leygues (also from south west France), he was charged by Jean Cruppi, then minister of Foreign Affairs, to work in 1911 for the restoration of diplomatic relations between France and Venezuela.\nIn 1894, he married Adrienne Willems, ni\u00e8ce of the painter Florent Willems and frequented, alongside many free-thinkers and free-masons, the Luscrambo, an association which grouped the Toulousains of Paris, founded by the singer and future director of the Op\u00e9ra Pedro Gailhard.\nHis novel Gaucher Myrian, written in collaboration with the Bordeaux intellectual and musicologist Anatole Loquin was published in 1893, and attests to his interest in catharism. In 1906, he became a member of the Eglise gnostique catholique, alongside L\u00e9once-Eug\u00e8ne Fabre des Essarts and Gabriel Faur\u00e9.\nIn 1897, Arthur Meyer entrusted him with the direction of the illustrated literary supplement of the Gaulois which had just been created with the title Le Gaulois du dimanche. In 1899, he bought the Nouvelle Revue from Juliette Adam. Under his direction, this periodical enjoyed a particularly brilliant period.\nIn 1911, he acquired the castle of the Baron, Albert de L'Esp\u00e9e, at Ilbarritz, by Biarritz at auction, and envisaged making a golf course; the 1914 war stopped the works and he transformed the house into a hospital for repatriated injured soldiers during the First World War. He himself served as subalterne/officier d'ordonnance of Gallieni.\nPedro Gailhard had called him to serve in the direction of the Paris Op\u00e9ra in 1906 and in 1914, he became director of the l'Op\u00e9ra Comique, alongside \u00c9mile and Vincent Isola. He was suddenly removed in 1918 by his sworn enemy Clemenceau. After a short time running the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique du Vaudeville (1919\u20131920), he became editor of Figaro and soon was promoted to administrative director. He was especially entrusted by the new proprietor, Fran\u00e7ois Coty, with organizing the merger with Le Gaulois in 1929, before leaving in 1932.\nIn that year Anatole de Monzie, Minister of Public Instruction and Beaux-Arts, nominated him again Director of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique which was in a financial crisis. Gheusi used his own funds to assist the theatre, but he was forced to resign at the time of the strikes of 1936.He died in Paris on 30 January 1943.

Lavigerie promoted Catholicism among the peoples of North Africa, as well as the Black natives further south. He was equally ardent to transform them into French subjects.\nHe crusaded against the slave trade, and he founded the order of priests called the White Fathers, so named for their white cassocks and red fezzes. He also established similar orders of brothers and nuns. He sent his missionaries to the Sahara, Sudan, Tunisia, and Tripolitania. His efforts were supported by the Pope and the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.\nAlthough anti-clericalism was a major issue in France, the secular leader L\u00e9on Gambetta proclaimed, \"Anti-clericalism is not an article for export\", and he supported Lavigerie's work.Lavigerie died in 1892 at the age of 67.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_21722", "text": "Born in Bayonne, he was educated at St Sulpice, Paris.

C'est l\u00e0, he wrote, que j'ai connu enfin ma vocation (\"It was there that I learned my calling\"). In 1860, as Director for oriental schools, he travelled to Lebanon and Syria to administer relief to Christians there, following the massacre by the Druze.\nActivity in missionary work, especially in alleviating the distresses of the victims of the Druzes, soon brought him prominently into notice. He was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor and, in October 1861, shortly after his return to Europe, was appointed French auditor at Rome.Two years later he was raised to the see of Nancy, where he remained for four years, during which the diocese became one of the best administered in France. He declined the appointment of Archbishop of Lyons, requesting instead an appointment to the see of Algiers, just raised to an archbishopric. Lavigerie landed in Africa on 11 May 1868, when the great famine was already making itself felt, and he began in November to collect the orphans into villages.This action, however, did not meet with the approval of Marshal MacMahon, governor-general of Algeria, who feared that the natives would resent it as an infraction of the religious peace, and he thought that the Muslim faith, being a state institution in Algeria, ought to be protected from proselytism; so it was intimated to the prelate that his sole duty was to minister to the colonists.

He gained a degree at the university of Giessen and then, accused by authorities in the Grand Duchy of Hesse of being subversive, he fled, first to Zurich, where he received a degree in medicine before being expelled in 1836 for politics and duelling; in 1837 he arrived in London, where he eked out a living teaching German, but gained a reputation by his contributions to medical and scientific journals and made friendships with geologists Charles Lyell and Richard Owen among others. Recommendations put him aboard the Tory bound for New Zealand, travelling in the capacity of surgeon, surveyor and naturalist.\nDuring the 1840s he was a correspondent of Charles Darwin, whose Journal of Researches Dieffenbach translated into German and published, with Darwin's notes and corrections, as Naturwissenschaftliche Reisen (Brunswick, 1853). Darwin knew Dieffenbach's paper on the Chatham Islands, contributed to the journal of the Royal Geographical Society, and he particularly noted Dieffenbach's commentary on the differences between the species of birds there and in New Zealand. Dieffenbach also translated the Geological Manual of Henry De la Beche. Partly as a result of these efforts, in 1850 he was named adjunct professor of geology at Giessen, a post he held until his death there.\nThe extinct Dieffenbach's rail (Gallirallus dieffenbachii) a flightless rail formerly endemic to the Chatham Islands, was named after him.

Her film work includes North Korea's Southern Army (1990), My Love, My Bride (1990), Susanne Brink's Arirang (1991) and The Letter (1997). Widely regarded as the most popular actress of her time, she led the entertainment industry in terms of commercial success across film, television, and advertising. She played leading roles in 18 films and 20 television dramas, appeared in hundreds of advertisements, and won several awards. She was 39 when she died by suicide by hanging on October 2, 2008, at her home in Seoul.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_21847", "text": "Choi was born as the first child to her parents Choi Guk-hyeon and Jung Ok-suk on December 24, 1968, in Seoul. Her mother separated from her father in 1985 and divorced him in 1998. She had a younger brother, Choi Jin-young, who was an actor and singer, and two elder half-brothers, brought in by her father from a previous relationship. Her mother only knew of the other children after marrying her father.When she was two years old, her father, a taxi driver, contracted tuberculous pleurisy and was unable to work, selling the taxi he owned. At the age of four, she lived with her extended family\u2014father, mother, younger brother, three aunts, three uncles, and a grandmother\u2014in a rundown three-room shack in the mountain village of Gupabal. Her poverty-stricken mother took Choi and her younger brother up a hill to commit suicide, but the attempt failed and they returned home crying. When she was ten, her father went to work as a laborer in the Middle East, and her family moved to Bulgwang-dong, Eunpyeong-gu. She attended Dongmyeong Girls' Middle School while actress Kang Soo-yeon attended Dongmyeong Girls' High School, and both schools are located within the same fence. Choi admired Kang, who started her career as a child actress in the 1970s. She used to secretly watch the actress outside her class and even sat in her seat when no one else was in the room. She showed aptitude for physical education and was especially talented in art, winning various competitions, and her teacher encouraged her to go to art school.Her family was so poor that her mother once managed the household by running a pojangmacha (a small street stall selling foods) when her father ran away from home. She gave up going to art school and it was only through her blind (habitual) \"going to school,\" and the support of friends and teachers that she was able to graduate from high school. A biology teacher even paid Choi's tuition out of his own salary. She dreamed of becoming a star to escape poverty. She said in talk shows her nickname during her school days was \"Choisujebi\" because she used to eat sujebi (a dumpling soup) instead of ordinary meals due to the home environment. Although she later became the highest taxpayer among celebrities, she was known for frugality, even receiving Presidential Commendations for her savings activity.She and her younger brother worked on their acting skills together and they passed the KBS Talent Recruitment Test in 1986. However, their mother did not want her to enter the entertainment industry, and she was unable to pay for her training at the broadcaster, so her dreams of becoming an actress were put on hold.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_21848", "text": "After the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the Korean economy took a leap forward, color TVs became widespread, and Choi's image on screen was exquisite. With the success of the Samsung Electronics commercial in 1988, she turned the relationship between advertising model and actor upside down. While commercial modeling was often a sideline after an actor gained recognition through the success of a drama, Choi's commercials gave her the same recognition that an actor gained through a drama, showing that the advertising world could be an equally stately stage for an actor. Her swift rise to stardom coincided with the dramatic changes in South Korea's political, economic, social, and cultural landscape. Samsung Electronics used the 1988 Seoul Olympics to boost the popularity of color TVs, and Choi helped the company beat out its competitors to the top spot in home appliance sales, appearing in commercials for most of their products.Choi believed that commercials, even as 30-second videos, have an aesthetic that captures the spirit of the times, and that they are an integration of artistic activities; from basic visual arts, marketing techniques and image-making that borrowed from psychology, to the brilliant slogans and dialogue. In an interview with CyberTimes.TV, Choi said that she considers her commercials as part of her work as an actress. Her success as an advertising model was apparent in her endorsements for South Korean giants Samsung, LG, Lotte, KIA Motors, Hyundai, Korea Telecom, and various clothing and cosmetics brands, among others. She maintained a relationship with KT and Samsung throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and was a contributor for the latter's increase in market share. As an expression of goodwill, she filmed a free commercial for KIA Motors when the company was facing bankruptcy due to the Asian financial crisis.In October 1992, Choi became the first celebrity to throw out the first pitch in the KBO League Korean Series. In a public opinion poll on 'Advertising Model Preference' conducted by the Korea Broadcast Advertising Corporation, she ranked first overall with 52% of the votes, while Yoo In-chon ranked first among male advertising models with 13%. She consistently topped consumer preference surveys and is the most-loved advertising model of her time. In the same month, she was invited to the Blue House luncheon hosted by President Roh Tae-woo as a person of merit in saving. In December 1992, she was awarded the inaugural Star of the Year Award by the weekly broadcast information magazine TV Journal.Ma Jung-mi, a culture researcher and advertising critic, published a book called The Choi Jin-sil Syndrome (Chungha, 1993; ISBN 978-89-403-0163-0). The book analyzes \"Choi Jin-sil and eroticism\", \"The product aesthetic of Choi Jin-sil\", \"The new generation theory symbolized by Choi Jin-sil,\" and \"The relationship between commercials featuring Choi Jin-sil and capitalism\". Ma's cultural analysis focuses on the post-war period as 'before' and the early 1990s as 'after', when Choi began her career as an entertainer. The book, which studied popularity factors for a celebrity, broke new ground in the field of theoretical books analyzing influential stars in popular culture.In April 1993, MBC conducted a poll among students to determine 'Korea's Top 100 Stars', including all public figures such as politicians, actors, singers, comedians, athletes, etc. President Kim Young-sam topped the list and Choi was number two, at a time when the president's popularity was soaring due to the crackdown on bribery and the disclosure of public officials' assets. Choi became the face of the real-name financial system the following year in 1994 and was invited by President Kim to a luncheon at the Blue House.She worked at MBC from 1988 until 1993. In February 1994, she signed an exclusive contract with SBS for 100 episodes, and became the highest paid actor at the time of her move to the new network, which was known in the industry for offering huge contracts to secure big-name talents. She spent the next two years appearing in SBS dramas such as Scent of Love, Asphalt Man, and Jazz, helping raise the profile of the network. However, before completing 100 episodes, she was offered a role at MBC in 1995 and was cast in the MBC weekend drama Apartment. Her appearance in Apartment was an indication of her status, in that MBC brought back an SBS-exclusive actress despite the fact that she had left MBC, and in that SBS was willing to allow her to appear on another network, even though she still had an exclusive contract with SBS. In March 1996, SBS re-signed Choi an exclusive contract. She was offered several drama roles but had repeatedly declined, saying, \"The role is not right.\" Since she was occupied with films and CFs, she also had to turn down offers due to scheduling conflict. A year later in 1997, MBC offered her a role in a drama, and she decided to appear in MBC's Star in My Heart. When SBS filed for a preliminary injunction, then MBC President Lee Deuk-ryul reportedly went to the top management of SBS and asked for leniency. MBC executives also personally visited SBS executives. Unlike in 1995, SBS demanded a penalty fee from Choi as per the contract, and MBC agreed to pay the penalty instead.In late 1994, MBC's The New Human Era surveyed stars in various fields for a New Year's special titled '50 Leading Koreans', and Choi was ranked first in the actress category. On November 29, 1994, the city of Seoul held an event to bury a time capsule to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the establishment of Seoul as the capital in 1394, and also included an interview with Choi, who said, \"I want to be someone who will go down in history. Please remember me. Thank you.\" The time capsule will be opened 400 years later in 2394.\nIn March 1996, she became the face of the ruling New Korea Party, the first time in the history of South Korean politics that a celebrity has been the face of a political party. The New Korea Party was founded in December 1995, dropping the name Democratic Liberal Party in an attempt to shed its military image. The party selected Choi to be the face of its newspaper advertisements in an effort to break down the rigid public image of existing political parties and make them more approachable to the people. The New Korea Party said, \"Choi Jin-sil, who is popular with almost all voters from those in their 20s to those in their 60s, will help enhance the image of the party. It was a choice to break away from the politics of the authoritarian era,\" and added, \u201cOur party will do our best to avoid compromising Choi Jin-sil\u2019s popularity.\u201dIn a 1997 survey of public figures who fulfilled their ambitions, Choi was ranked as the number one celebrity, along with then president Kim Young-sam as the number one politician, Hyundai Group founder Chung Joo-young as the number one businessman, and baseball player Park Chan-ho as the number one sportsman. In October 1997, Samsung Economic Research Institute published a report titled Star Power Analysis of Korean Movie Stars, analyzing the power of 50 leading actors in 529 films released in Seoul from 1988 to 1995. Choi was selected as the movie star with the best audience mobilization power along with actor Choi Min-soo. In December 1997, Choi and comedian Lee Kyung-kyu visited the 15th president-elect Kim Dae-jung at his home for an interview.In March 1998, Korea Telecom released a public phone card modeled after Choi for a campaign to overcome the economic crisis. In August 1998, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the nation, Gallup Korea conducted a survey on \u2018Top Celebrities of the 50 Years of the Founding of the Republic of Korea'. Choi ranked first overall in the talent and actor category for all age groups combined, beating out the most popular actors of the past and of her time. The poll surveyed men and women aged between 11 and 59 across the country. In the same month, she appeared in a national promotional campaign alongside President Kim Dae-jung. Although Choi was not in politics, her image as the \"soft power of the masses\" was used to represent the current post-authoritarian and post-military government at the time. Her success as a commercial model made her the embodiment of the zeitgeist of the populus, where politics needed to be advertised anew.In December 1999, MBC produced a documentary that looked at modern Korean history in the 20th century, featuring 60 people, including Choi in the \"Heroes and Idols\" category. The program featured 20 people in each of three categories: \"Leaders and Revolutionaries\", \"Women\", and \"Heroes and Idols\"; and showcased these individuals who have had a significant impact on history or society in general, or who have worked to break new ground. Sunday Night, the longest-running South Korean television entertainment program, conducted a poll of 1,000 Seoul citizens on the \u2018Best Star of the 20th Century\u2019 in each field of the entertainment industry. Choi was voted the best star among television actors.In October 2003, Nielsen Media Research conducted a survey on the most popular South Korean leading actors based on the top 50 television dramas with the highest viewership ratings of all time. Choi was recorded as the most prolific actor with lead roles in six TV dramas, including Promise (1992), Jealousy (1992), Season of Storms (1993), You and I (1997), Star in My Heart (1997), and Roses and Bean Sprouts (1999). Her Jealousy co-star Choi Soo-jong came in second with lead roles in five dramas.In 2005, Choi was voted as the most popular talent among men and women according to a survey by Gallup Korea. From the result of the survey conducted among 1,502 adult men and women aged 20 and older across the country, Choi ranked first with 18.2% of the votes. She received the full support of female viewers in their 20s and 40s.In 2010, leading Chinese portal Wang Yi selected the 'Top 10 Female Protagonists in Korean Dramas', and posted photos of actresses along with nicknames based on each actress' characteristics. Choi was voted the number one female protagonist, with netizens giving her the nickname \"Eternal Cinderella\" for her starring role in Star in My Heart.In 2011, Ezday surveyed netizens about the most memorable dramas from the 1990s. Jealousy starring Choi Jin-sil and Choi Soo-jong was voted as the most memorable drama by 20% of respondents, followed closely by Star in My Heart also starring Choi and Ahn Jae-wook with 19% of the votes. For 'Best Actress of the 1990s', Choi took the top spot by a wide margin with 34% of respondents, followed by Kim Hee-sun, Shim Eun-ha, Shin Ae-ra, Lee Seung-yeon, and Jeon Do-yeon. For 'Best Actor of the 1990s', Jang Dong-gun was chosen by 21% of respondents.On November 15, 2014, she received the Achievement Award at the 3rd Asia Pacific Actors Network (APAN) Star Awards for her contribution to the development of Korean dramas as a first-generation Hallyu actress.In a 2015 survey for the 30th anniversary of The Daily Sports Seoul, 30 entertainment industry experts from broadcasting, film, and music were asked to reflect on 30 years of Korean entertainment. Choi was chosen as the best actress of the past 30 years, with Sports Seoul writing, \"Among actresses, the most prominent is the now-deceased Choi Jin-sil. As she was voted by 10 respondents, the vacancy she left felt even bigger\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_21847", "text": "Choi was born as the first child to her parents Choi Guk-hyeon and Jung Ok-suk on December 24, 1968, in Seoul. Her mother separated from her father in 1985 and divorced him in 1998. She had a younger brother, Choi Jin-young, who was an actor and singer, and two elder half-brothers, brought in by her father from a previous relationship. Her mother only knew of the other children after marrying her father.When she was two years old, her father, a taxi driver, contracted tuberculous pleurisy and was unable to work, selling the taxi he owned. At the age of four, she lived with her extended family\u2014father, mother, younger brother, three aunts, three uncles, and a grandmother\u2014in a rundown three-room shack in the mountain village of Gupabal. Her poverty-stricken mother took Choi and her younger brother up a hill to commit suicide, but the attempt failed and they returned home crying. When she was ten, her father went to work as a laborer in the Middle East, and her family moved to Bulgwang-dong, Eunpyeong-gu. She attended Dongmyeong Girls' Middle School while actress Kang Soo-yeon attended Dongmyeong Girls' High School, and both schools are located within the same fence. Choi admired Kang, who started her career as a child actress in the 1970s. She used to secretly watch the actress outside her class and even sat in her seat when no one else was in the room. She showed aptitude for physical education and was especially talented in art, winning various competitions, and her teacher encouraged her to go to art school.Her family was so poor that her mother once managed the household by running a pojangmacha (a small street stall selling foods) when her father ran away from home. She gave up going to art school and it was only through her blind (habitual) \"going to school,\" and the support of friends and teachers that she was able to graduate from high school. A biology teacher even paid Choi's tuition out of his own salary. She dreamed of becoming a star to escape poverty. She said in talk shows her nickname during her school days was \"Choisujebi\" because she used to eat sujebi (a dumpling soup) instead of ordinary meals due to the home environment. Although she later became the highest taxpayer among celebrities, she was known for frugality, even receiving Presidential Commendations for her savings activity.She and her younger brother worked on their acting skills together and they passed the KBS Talent Recruitment Test in 1986. However, their mother did not want her to enter the entertainment industry, and she was unable to pay for her training at the broadcaster, so her dreams of becoming an actress were put on hold.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_21848", "text": "After the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the Korean economy took a leap forward, color TVs became widespread, and Choi's image on screen was exquisite. With the success of the Samsung Electronics commercial in 1988, she turned the relationship between advertising model and actor upside down. While commercial modeling was often a sideline after an actor gained recognition through the success of a drama, Choi's commercials gave her the same recognition that an actor gained through a drama, showing that the advertising world could be an equally stately stage for an actor. Her swift rise to stardom coincided with the dramatic changes in South Korea's political, economic, social, and cultural landscape. Samsung Electronics used the 1988 Seoul Olympics to boost the popularity of color TVs, and Choi helped the company beat out its competitors to the top spot in home appliance sales, appearing in commercials for most of their products.Choi believed that commercials, even as 30-second videos, have an aesthetic that captures the spirit of the times, and that they are an integration of artistic activities; from basic visual arts, marketing techniques and image-making that borrowed from psychology, to the brilliant slogans and dialogue. In an interview with CyberTimes.TV, Choi said that she considers her commercials as part of her work as an actress. Her success as an advertising model was apparent in her endorsements for South Korean giants Samsung, LG, Lotte, KIA Motors, Hyundai, Korea Telecom, and various clothing and cosmetics brands, among others. She maintained a relationship with KT and Samsung throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and was a contributor for the latter's increase in market share. As an expression of goodwill, she filmed a free commercial for KIA Motors when the company was facing bankruptcy due to the Asian financial crisis.In October 1992, Choi became the first celebrity to throw out the first pitch in the KBO League Korean Series. In a public opinion poll on 'Advertising Model Preference' conducted by the Korea Broadcast Advertising Corporation, she ranked first overall with 52% of the votes, while Yoo In-chon ranked first among male advertising models with 13%. She consistently topped consumer preference surveys and is the most-loved advertising model of her time. In the same month, she was invited to the Blue House luncheon hosted by President Roh Tae-woo as a person of merit in saving. In December 1992, she was awarded the inaugural Star of the Year Award by the weekly broadcast information magazine TV Journal.Ma Jung-mi, a culture researcher and advertising critic, published a book called The Choi Jin-sil Syndrome (Chungha, 1993; ISBN 978-89-403-0163-0). The book analyzes \"Choi Jin-sil and eroticism\", \"The product aesthetic of Choi Jin-sil\", \"The new generation theory symbolized by Choi Jin-sil,\" and \"The relationship between commercials featuring Choi Jin-sil and capitalism\". Ma's cultural analysis focuses on the post-war period as 'before' and the early 1990s as 'after', when Choi began her career as an entertainer. The book, which studied popularity factors for a celebrity, broke new ground in the field of theoretical books analyzing influential stars in popular culture.In April 1993, MBC conducted a poll among students to determine 'Korea's Top 100 Stars', including all public figures such as politicians, actors, singers, comedians, athletes, etc. President Kim Young-sam topped the list and Choi was number two, at a time when the president's popularity was soaring due to the crackdown on bribery and the disclosure of public officials' assets. Choi became the face of the real-name financial system the following year in 1994 and was invited by President Kim to a luncheon at the Blue House.She worked at MBC from 1988 until 1993. In February 1994, she signed an exclusive contract with SBS for 100 episodes, and became the highest paid actor at the time of her move to the new network, which was known in the industry for offering huge contracts to secure big-name talents. She spent the next two years appearing in SBS dramas such as Scent of Love, Asphalt Man, and Jazz, helping raise the profile of the network. However, before completing 100 episodes, she was offered a role at MBC in 1995 and was cast in the MBC weekend drama Apartment. Her appearance in Apartment was an indication of her status, in that MBC brought back an SBS-exclusive actress despite the fact that she had left MBC, and in that SBS was willing to allow her to appear on another network, even though she still had an exclusive contract with SBS. In March 1996, SBS re-signed Choi an exclusive contract. She was offered several drama roles but had repeatedly declined, saying, \"The role is not right.\" Since she was occupied with films and CFs, she also had to turn down offers due to scheduling conflict. A year later in 1997, MBC offered her a role in a drama, and she decided to appear in MBC's Star in My Heart. When SBS filed for a preliminary injunction, then MBC President Lee Deuk-ryul reportedly went to the top management of SBS and asked for leniency. MBC executives also personally visited SBS executives. Unlike in 1995, SBS demanded a penalty fee from Choi as per the contract, and MBC agreed to pay the penalty instead.In late 1994, MBC's The New Human Era surveyed stars in various fields for a New Year's special titled '50 Leading Koreans', and Choi was ranked first in the actress category. On November 29, 1994, the city of Seoul held an event to bury a time capsule to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the establishment of Seoul as the capital in 1394, and also included an interview with Choi, who said, \"I want to be someone who will go down in history. Please remember me. Thank you.\" The time capsule will be opened 400 years later in 2394.\nIn March 1996, she became the face of the ruling New Korea Party, the first time in the history of South Korean politics that a celebrity has been the face of a political party. The New Korea Party was founded in December 1995, dropping the name Democratic Liberal Party in an attempt to shed its military image. The party selected Choi to be the face of its newspaper advertisements in an effort to break down the rigid public image of existing political parties and make them more approachable to the people. The New Korea Party said, \"Choi Jin-sil, who is popular with almost all voters from those in their 20s to those in their 60s, will help enhance the image of the party. It was a choice to break away from the politics of the authoritarian era,\" and added, \u201cOur party will do our best to avoid compromising Choi Jin-sil\u2019s popularity.\u201dIn a 1997 survey of public figures who fulfilled their ambitions, Choi was ranked as the number one celebrity, along with then president Kim Young-sam as the number one politician, Hyundai Group founder Chung Joo-young as the number one businessman, and baseball player Park Chan-ho as the number one sportsman. In October 1997, Samsung Economic Research Institute published a report titled Star Power Analysis of Korean Movie Stars, analyzing the power of 50 leading actors in 529 films released in Seoul from 1988 to 1995. Choi was selected as the movie star with the best audience mobilization power along with actor Choi Min-soo. In December 1997, Choi and comedian Lee Kyung-kyu visited the 15th president-elect Kim Dae-jung at his home for an interview.In March 1998, Korea Telecom released a public phone card modeled after Choi for a campaign to overcome the economic crisis. In August 1998, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the nation, Gallup Korea conducted a survey on \u2018Top Celebrities of the 50 Years of the Founding of the Republic of Korea'. Choi ranked first overall in the talent and actor category for all age groups combined, beating out the most popular actors of the past and of her time. The poll surveyed men and women aged between 11 and 59 across the country. In the same month, she appeared in a national promotional campaign alongside President Kim Dae-jung. Although Choi was not in politics, her image as the \"soft power of the masses\" was used to represent the current post-authoritarian and post-military government at the time. Her success as a commercial model made her the embodiment of the zeitgeist of the populus, where politics needed to be advertised anew.In December 1999, MBC produced a documentary that looked at modern Korean history in the 20th century, featuring 60 people, including Choi in the \"Heroes and Idols\" category. The program featured 20 people in each of three categories: \"Leaders and Revolutionaries\", \"Women\", and \"Heroes and Idols\"; and showcased these individuals who have had a significant impact on history or society in general, or who have worked to break new ground. Sunday Night, the longest-running South Korean television entertainment program, conducted a poll of 1,000 Seoul citizens on the \u2018Best Star of the 20th Century\u2019 in each field of the entertainment industry. Choi was voted the best star among television actors.In October 2003, Nielsen Media Research conducted a survey on the most popular South Korean leading actors based on the top 50 television dramas with the highest viewership ratings of all time. Choi was recorded as the most prolific actor with lead roles in six TV dramas, including Promise (1992), Jealousy (1992), Season of Storms (1993), You and I (1997), Star in My Heart (1997), and Roses and Bean Sprouts (1999). Her Jealousy co-star Choi Soo-jong came in second with lead roles in five dramas.In 2005, Choi was voted as the most popular talent among men and women according to a survey by Gallup Korea. From the result of the survey conducted among 1,502 adult men and women aged 20 and older across the country, Choi ranked first with 18.2% of the votes. She received the full support of female viewers in their 20s and 40s.In 2010, leading Chinese portal Wang Yi selected the 'Top 10 Female Protagonists in Korean Dramas', and posted photos of actresses along with nicknames based on each actress' characteristics. Choi was voted the number one female protagonist, with netizens giving her the nickname \"Eternal Cinderella\" for her starring role in Star in My Heart.In 2011, Ezday surveyed netizens about the most memorable dramas from the 1990s. Jealousy starring Choi Jin-sil and Choi Soo-jong was voted as the most memorable drama by 20% of respondents, followed closely by Star in My Heart also starring Choi and Ahn Jae-wook with 19% of the votes. For 'Best Actress of the 1990s', Choi took the top spot by a wide margin with 34% of respondents, followed by Kim Hee-sun, Shim Eun-ha, Shin Ae-ra, Lee Seung-yeon, and Jeon Do-yeon. For 'Best Actor of the 1990s', Jang Dong-gun was chosen by 21% of respondents.On November 15, 2014, she received the Achievement Award at the 3rd Asia Pacific Actors Network (APAN) Star Awards for her contribution to the development of Korean dramas as a first-generation Hallyu actress.In a 2015 survey for the 30th anniversary of The Daily Sports Seoul, 30 entertainment industry experts from broadcasting, film, and music were asked to reflect on 30 years of Korean entertainment.

One of the Five Members whose attempted arrest in January 1642 was a major step in sparking the First English Civil War, his use of procedure to out manoeuvre opponents was unusual for the period. Though this meant he was respected by contemporaries rather than admired, in 1895 historian Goldwin Smith described him as \"the greatest member of Parliament that ever lived\".Pym's father died when he was seven months old, and he was raised by his stepfather Sir Anthony Rous, from whom he inherited his Puritan views and deep opposition to the reforms of Archbishop William Laud. He was also a leading member of the Providence Island Company, which attempted to establish a Puritan colony in Central America.\nDescribed as 'a true revolutionary', he led the opposition to arbitrary rule first under James I, then Charles I. His leadership in the early stages of the war was essential to the Parliamentarian cause, particularly his role in negotiating the Solemn League and Covenant with the Scots Covenanters; his death from cancer in December 1643 was considered a major blow.Originally buried in Westminster Abbey,  after the Stuart Restoration in 1660, his body was dumped in a pit at nearby St Margaret's, Westminster along with those of other Parliamentary leaders.

Among the musicians who passed through the Five Pennies were clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, violinist Joe Venuti, bass saxophonist Adrian Rollini, tuba and bass player Joe Tarto, trombonist Glenn Miller, and extra trumpeters such as Leo McConville and Charlie Teagarden.\nWhen Jack Teagarden arrived in New York in 1928, he replaced Mole as the role model for trombonists, with a more legato, blues-oriented approach. Having started working for radio in 1927 (at WOR), Mole changed his focus to working with NBC (1929\u20131938). In 1938\u20131940, he was a member of Paul Whiteman's orchestra, but his style by then had changed under the influence of Teagarden. In 1942\u20131943, Mole played in Benny Goodman's orchestra, and between 1942 and 1947 he led dixieland bands. He worked in Chicago in 1947\u20131954.Due to bad health, Mole played sporadically during his last years. He died in New York City on April 29, 1961. A benefit to raise money for his medical expenses was scheduled too late. He was interred in the family plot in Greenfield Cemetery, Hempstead, Long Island, New York.\nMole's solo style, which included octave-leaps, shakes, and rapid-fire cadenzas, had a profound effect on jazz trombone playing in his time. Among those who emulated Mole's playing were trombonists Bill Rank, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Jimmy Harrison. His 1928 recording of \"Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble\" with the Little Molers (Okeh), was used in the soundtrack to the Russell Crowe movie Cinderella Man (2005).\nIn 2008, his composition \"There'll Come a Time (Wait and See)\", written with Wingy Manone, was on the soundtrack to the Academy Award-nominated movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "20_21935", "text": "Miff Mole's compositions included \"Slippin' Around\", \"There'll Come a Time (Wait and See)\" with Wingy Manone, \"Hangover\" with Red Nichols, \"Worryin' the Life Out of Me\" with Frank Signorelli and Sidney Keith 'Bob' Russell, and \"Miff's Blues\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Historian Michael Joseph Corcoran has stated that she was \"The Mother of Tejano Music\", an art form that is the uniquely Texas cultural amalgamation of traditional Mexican, Spanish, German, and Czech musical roots. She recorded on numerous labels over the course of her six-decade career of live performing. The aggregate total of her records numbers an estimated 200 different Spanish-language songs on at least 50 LP record albums. In 1977, she performed at the Inauguration of President Jimmy Carter, as part of the line-up for the Inaugural Folk Dance and Concert. Her most well-known tune was \"Mal Hombre\" (Bad Man), a song she had heard as a child.\nShe was born in Houston, Texas, into a Mexican musical family originally from San Luis Potos\u00ed. The family had fled Mexico at the onset of the Mexican Revolution, after which they returned home for two years. When she was four years old, the family once again immigrated to Texas. Although she lived most of her life in the United States, primarily Texas, she never spoke any language but Spanish. The family moved frequently to find work and entertained other migrant workers wherever they went.\nMendoza was known by many nicknames, such as \"La Alondra de la Frontera\" (The Meadowlark of the Border). In their early years of performing, \"La Familia Mendoza\" (the Mendoza family) would hitchhike around south Texas, performing for farm laborers. Answering an advertisement in a Spanish-language newspaper resulted in their first recording sessions with Okeh Records. She was only 12 years old, but Lydia provided vocals and played the mandolin for the recordings. They eventually caught the notice of San Antonio radio personality Manuel J. Cortez and were offered a recording contract with the RCA Victor subsidiary of Bluebird Records. During World War II, and for several years afterward, Mendoza and her sisters Juanita and Marie performed as Las Hermanas Mendoza (the Mendoza sisters). She fairly quickly emerged as the headliner of the group, but her family continued to perform with her as she toured. Not only did she perform throughout the United States, but also in Canada and Latin America, where her attendance records were estimated to be 20,000.\nShe was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1984, she was inducted into the Tejano Music Hall of Fame, and in 1991, into the Conjunto Music Hall of Fame. For her contributions to the performing arts, she was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. In 1999, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts by First Lady Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton, and in 2003 she was bestowed with the Texas Cultural Trust's Texas Medal of Arts. She designed and sewed her own stage costumes, and at one point was an instructor at California State University, Fresno. Mendoza was married twice and the mother of three daughters.

Here he met his youth curiosity. Andersen broke new ground both methodologically and theoretically with this work. He developed a method for stereoscopic analysis of aerial photos in the assessment of moraines. During the 1950s and 1960s he assessed the moraines in most of Norway, from Lindesnes to Troms. The assessment of the moraines of J\u00e6ren and the rest of the south coast of Norway was the basis of his PhD thesis \"S\u00f8rlandet i sen- og postglacial tid\" (The Norwegian South Coast in late and postglacial time), under guidance of Olaf Holtedahl, defended in 1960.\nAndersen discovered an until then unknown area of Rogaland containing rock of the Cambrian-Silurian age on a much lower level than the surrounding bedrock. His collected fossiles from this area were deposited in the Paleontologic Museum at T\u00f8yen in Oslo. In this material Professor Gunnar Henningsmoen discovered an until then unknown trilobite species, which was given the name (Ptychparia anderseni) for Andersen. During this fieldwork in the Lysefjord area, Andersen developed a method for determination of climatic conditions from the reconstruction of Ice Age glaciers which is still used by geologists and geographers.\nAndersen's first paper  is one of the most basic papers in Norwegian glacial geology, even though it was published before C-14 dating was available. The Younger Dryas glacier of the Lysefjord was reconstructed in three dimensions and compared with the glaciers in Greenland today. Further, the highest side moraines were used to determine the equilibrium line of the paleo-glaciers and thus its lowering by comparison with today's glaciers.

His students and the university benefited from his international contacts and he conducted filed trips to the Antarctic, South America and New Zealand. Most of all his contribution was to reveal the foundation of Scandinavian landscapes.\n\nAndersen's first expedition to the South Pole came in a period of small Norwegian interest in the Antarctic after the great achievements of Roald Amundsen in 1911\u20131912. Andersen was the second Norwegian to visit the Pole after the Amundsen expedition. An American expedition which reached the Pole a week before him honored his achievements by naming a mountain escarpment Andersen Escarpment after him.During the fieldworks for his Master's thesis \"Om isens tilbaketrekking i omr\u00e5det mellom Lysefjorden og J\u00f8senfjorden i Ryfylke\" (On the glacial retreat in the area between the Lysefjorden and J\u00f8senfjorden in Ryfylke), with Werner Werenskiold as advisor, he found among other things that Trollgaren was a moraine, and that it was formed in the early Holocene, probably about 11,000 years ago. Here he met his youth curiosity. Andersen broke new ground both methodologically and theoretically with this work. He developed a method for stereoscopic analysis of aerial photos in the assessment of moraines. During the 1950s and 1960s he assessed the moraines in most of Norway, from Lindesnes to Troms. The assessment of the moraines of J\u00e6ren and the rest of the south coast of Norway was the basis of his PhD thesis \"S\u00f8rlandet i sen- og postglacial tid\" (The Norwegian South Coast in late and postglacial time), under guidance of Olaf Holtedahl, defended in 1960.\nAndersen discovered an until then unknown area of Rogaland containing rock of the Cambrian-Silurian age on a much lower level than the surrounding bedrock. His collected fossiles from this area were deposited in the Paleontologic Museum at T\u00f8yen in Oslo. In this material Professor Gunnar Henningsmoen discovered an until then unknown trilobite species, which was given the name (Ptychparia anderseni) for Andersen. During this fieldwork in the Lysefjord area, Andersen developed a method for determination of climatic conditions from the reconstruction of Ice Age glaciers which is still used by geologists and geographers.\nAndersen's first paper  is one of the most basic papers in Norwegian glacial geology, even though it was published before C-14 dating was available. The Younger Dryas glacier of the Lysefjord was reconstructed in three dimensions and compared with the glaciers in Greenland today. Further, the highest side moraines were used to determine the equilibrium line of the paleo-glaciers and thus its lowering by comparison with today's glaciers. In this way he was able to estimate the decrease of summer temperature with surprising accuracy. These decreased temperatures were in compliance with the findings of botanist Knut F\u00e6gri at the Younger Dryas glacier of J\u00e6ren.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A survey conducted in the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) found Misirkov to be \"the most significant Macedonian of the 20th century\". For his efforts to codify a standard Macedonian language, he is often considered \"the founder of the modern Macedonian literary language\".On the other hand, he was one of the founders of the pro-Bulgarian Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Circle established in 1900 in St. Petersburg. In 1905 he began publishing predominantly articles, written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective in the IMARO-affiliated press. In his diary written during the Balkan Wars, he espoused pro-Bulgarian views. During the First World War, he became a member of the local parliament in Bessarabia as a representative of the Bulgarian minority there. During the 1920s he encouraged the Macedonian Slavs to adopt a Bulgarian national identity. Misirkov returned to Macedonian nationalism for a period in 1914 and again in 1924 and 1925. Misirkov died in 1926 and was buried in the Sofia Central Cemetery with the financial support from the Ministry of Education, as an honoured Bulgarian educator.\nBecause Misirkov expressed conflicting views about the national identity of the Macedonian Slavs at different points in his life, his national affiliation and legacy remain a matter of dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia. While Misirkov's work and personality remain highly controversial and disputed, there have been attempts among international scholars to reconcile the conflicting and self-contradictory statements made by Misirkov. According to historian Ivo Banac, Misirkov viewed both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians, and espoused pan-Bulgarian patriotism in a larger Balkan context. However, in the context of the larger Bulgarian unit/nation, Misirkov sought both cultural and national differentiation from the other Bulgarians and called both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia, Macedonians.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "20_21976", "text": "During the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the idea of a separate Macedonian ethnicity was as of yet promoted by small circles of intellectuals.

Together with Bona Sforza (1494\u20131557), she is regarded as one of the most influential and powerful queen consorts of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nBorn in Nevers to Charles I, Duke of Mantua and Catherine of Guise, Marie was brought up at the French court as the future bride of Duke Gaston of Orl\u00e9ans.

After his death in 1648, the widowed queen married his half-brother and successor, John II Casimir. Marie Louise exuded considerable influence over her second husband and dictated the political course in the country. An ambitious and energetic woman, she was a strong supporter of an absolute monarchy for which she was reviled by certain spheres of the Polish nobility. She, nevertheless, remained active in the Commonwealth's politics and co-sponsored the foundation of the first Polish newspaper, Merkuriusz Polski Ordynaryjny (Polish Mercury Ordinary), in 1661 as well as other public institutions.\nWhile her role is regarded as crucial in repulsing the foreign forces out of Poland-Lithuania during the Swedish Deluge (1655\u20131660), she became increasingly unpopular for her absolutist policies and her intention of nominating her niece's husband, Henri Jules, the future Prince of Cond\u00e9, the heir apparent to the Polish throne. That resulted in a military conflict with the internal opposition, which ended with the defeat of the royal army in 1666, during the Lubomirski rebellion.
