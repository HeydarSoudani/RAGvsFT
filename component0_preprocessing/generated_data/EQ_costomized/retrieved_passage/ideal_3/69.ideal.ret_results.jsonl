He is known for his measurements of the energy of black-body radiation which led Max Planck to the discovery of his radiation law. This was the genesis of quantum theory.\nAfter having attended realgymnasium  W\u00f6hlerschule in Frankfurt am Main, he started in 1884 to study electrical engineering at the technical universities in Darmstadt and Berlin. The following year he switched to physics at the University of Berlin which was more to his liking. After just one semester there he transferred to Strasbourg. There he benefited much from the lectures by August Kundt who in 1888 took over the vacant position of Hermann Helmholtz at the University of Berlin. Rubens followed after and got his doctors degree there the same year. In the period 1890\u20131896 he was employed as an assistant at the physics institute and made his habilitation in 1892. He was then a privatdozent and was allowed to teach. Already then he was praised for his experimental investigations of infrared radiation.\nRubens got a permanent position in 1896 as docent at the Technical University of Berlin in Berlin-Charlottenburg. He could continue his experimental research at the nearby Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt. It was there he in 1900 did his important measurements of black-body radiation which made him world-famous. He was promoted to professor the same year.\nAfter Paul Drude retired in 1906 from his professorship at the University in Berlin, the position was given to Rubens. He was at the same time appointed director of the physics institute. In this way he could influence and lead a large group of colleagues and students. The year after he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences and became in 1908 a corresponding member G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He participated at the two first Solvay conferences after having received the Rumford Medal in 1910  \"on the ground of his researches on radiation, especially of long wave length.\".\nHeinrich Rubens died in 1922 after a longer illness. At a memorial meeting in the science academy the following year Max Planck said about him:\nWithout the intervention of Rubens the formulation of the radiation law and thereby the foundation of quantum theory would perhaps have arisen in quite a different manner, or perhaps not have developed in Germany at all.\nHe is buried at the Alter St.-Matth\u00e4us-Kirchhof in Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg with his wife Marie. She took her life in 1941 for fear of being deported and killed by the Nazis. The burial place is near that of Gustav Kirchhoff, who founded spectroscopy and formulated the first laws of black-body radiation.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "69_2821", "text": "Already as a student was Rubens fascinated by electromagnetic radiation as theoretically described by Maxwell and experimentally demonstrated by Hertz. Through the influence of Kundt he had become interested in understanding the optical properties of different materials. In his doctoral work he showed that reflection of light increases with increasing wavelengths into the infrared region. As a related result he could present an experimental verification of Maxwell's theory for electromagnetic waves in different media. This effort also turned into a demonstration of the validity of these equations for infrared radiation. Rubens succeeded in this for wavelengths up to 10 \u03bcm.Through the improvements of instruments and invention of new techniques he could measure infrared radiation for larger and larger wavelengths. One of his goals was to better understand the reflexion of radiation by metals and crystals. It was known that this became stronger for wavelengths which were absorbed. This lead him to a new, powerful method by selective reflexion from several crystals to isolate a narrow range of infrared wavelengths from a broader spectrum of radiation. Using such Reststrahlen he could in 1898 detect wavelengths of sizes around 60 \u03bcm.Together with Ferdinand Kurlbaum he started the same year to measure the energy content of black-body radiation in the far infrared region using this technique. For a fixed value of the wavelength they found that the energy increased linearly with the temperature. This was in disagreement with the ruling Wien's radiation law, but consistent with an alternative law proposed by Lord Rayleigh.\nOn 7 October 1900 Rubens and his wife were invited to dinner by Max Planck. Rubens told then his host about the new measurements done at a wavelength 51 \u03bcm. After the guests had left Planck managed to derive a new formula for the radiation energy which was consistent with the new results. He wrote it down on a postcard which Rubens received the following day. A few days later Rubens reported back that it seemed to fit all his measurements.

This enabled him also to make more and more accurate tests of Plancks new radiation theory and related studies of matter which soon could be described by quantum mechanics. He was loved by his students and colleagues for his care and accuracy in all experimental work.

He and his twin brother, Robert H. Hume, became famous in 1944 and 1945 as the \u201cdead heat twins\u201d due to their practice of finishing their races hand-in-hand in an intentional effort to finish each race tied for the win.  During the 1944 track season, the Hume twins tied for the win in nine straight mile races, including the Big Ten Conference and NCAA championships.  They were co-winners in every mile event they entered in 1944 except one.  The exception occurred at a dual meet in which \"a meticulous official ruled that one of the Humes beat the other across the finish line by a couple of inches although they were hand in hand at the wire.\"  Their best time in a \u201cdead heat\u201d mile with hands clasped was 4:14.6 at the Central Collegiate Conference meet in 1944; the time broke a school record of 4:16.4 that had been set by H.L. Carroll 28 years earlier in 1916.The Hume twins were raised in Canonsburg, a small town in Pennsylvania\u2019s soft coal region, not far from Pittsburgh.  Robert Hume set the school record for the mile, and Ross set the record in the half mile.   After graduating from Canonsburg High School, the Hume twins enrolled at the University of Michigan to run track under Coach Ken Doherty.  One sports columnist in 1945 noted that the Humes were \u201ctwins in every possible manner, facial resemblance, running style, the clothes they wear, and the courses they are taking.\u201dIn his track career at Michigan, Ross Hume won three NCAA championships and six Big Ten Conference championships.  He won the 1944 NCAA outdoor mile run in a dead heat with his brother.  And in 1945, he won NCAA individual championships in both the outdoor mile run and the outdoor 880-yard run.  He won six Big Ten championships from 1943-1946.  His  Big Ten championships included the indoor and outdoor mile runs in 1944 and 1945, all four of which were shared \u201cdead heat\u201d wins with his brother.  He also won Big Ten championships in the two-mile run in the 1944 outdoor and 1945 indoor conference championship meets.   Ross was named an NCAA All-American three times and was selected as the captain of Michigan\u2019s track team in 1945.\n\nThe Hume twins\u2019 practice of interlocking hands in \u201cdead heat\u201d wins drew national publicity and also controversy.  Associated Press columnist Jimmy Jordan dubbed them the \u201cdead heat twins.\u201d  Another writer referred to them as the \u201cDead Heat Kids.\u201d  The publicity peaked in June 1944 when \u201cMichigan's famous distance running twins raced to their ninth straight dead-heat victory in the mile run of the 23rd National Collegiate Athletic Association track and field championship meet tonight, finishing hand-in-hand more than 100 yards ahead of the next runner.\u201d  A columnist in Massachusetts wrote: \u201dAs the twins finished their sophomore year at Michigan, [Coach Ken] Doherty decided to run them in the mile and two mile races together \u2026 this proved to be a happy solution \u2026 the twins like to run together .. they\u2019ve been doing that since before their school days .. furthermore, they usually finish so far in front that the last 50 yards finds that they are clasping hands and hit the tape together.\u201d\nUnited Press columnist Bob Meyer noted that they \u201cdeliberately have finished in a dead heat for first place in every mile except one in which both were entered this year,\u201d and suggested that the twins \u201cpossibly may forget their sentimental trick of locking hands for a dead-heat finish in order to defeat a tough field and slice another second or 2 off their CCC time.\u201dAs a result of the Humes\u2019 practice, the NCAA passed a rule in 1946 stating that athletes would no longer be able to tie in any track meets.After graduating from Michigan, Ross Hume became an orthopedic surgeon.

{"id": "69_117", "question": "Where was Matthew Hale educated?", "ctxs": [{"id": "69_3075", "text": "Sir Matthew Hale  (1 November 1609 \u2013 25 December 1676) was an influential English barrister, judge and jurist most noted for his treatise Historia Placitorum Coron\u00e6, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown.\nBorn to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was 5, Hale was raised by his father's relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his faith. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father, thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628, he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. \nDespite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas.\nHale sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676.\nHale's published works were particularly influential in the development of English common law. His Historia Placitorum Coron\u00e6, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \"of the highest authority\", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \"appeal to reason\" and John Selden's \"appeal to contract\", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. Hale wrote that a man could not be charged with marital rape, and that view was widely held until the 1990s. However, he eliminated the previous rape defence that existed in English law for an unmarried man cohabiting with a woman.\nModern scholars also offer criticism of Hale for his execution of at least two women for witchcraft in the Bury St Edmunds witch trials and his belief that capital punishment should extend to those as young as fourteen.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "69_3076", "text": "Hale's views on rape, marriage and abortion have had a long legacy not only in Britain's legal system, but also in those of the British Colonies.According to Edward Foss in 2000, Hale was widely considered an excellent judge and jurist, particularly through his writings: he was an \"eminent judge, whom all look up to as one of the brightest luminaries of the law, as well for the soundness of his learning as for the excellence of his life\". Similarly, John Campbell in his Lives of the Chief Justices of England, wrote that Hale was \"one of the most pure, the most pious, the most independent, and the most learned\" of judges.In 1908, Henry Flanders, described Hale in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, during his lifetime as \"the most learned, the most able, the most honorable man to be found in the profession of the law\".Hale's writings have been cited by the US Supreme Court on numerous occasions. Justice Harry Blackmun cited Hale in \"Roe v. Wade\". Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer in \"Kahler v. Kansas\". In 2022, Hale's opinion on abortion was cited by Samuel Alito in his opinion of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, generating political controversy.In 1993, in the case of R v Kingston, the Court of Appeal relied on his statement that \"drunkenness is not a defence\" to uphold a conviction. William Holdsworth argued in 1923 that it was his learning in Roman law and jurisprudence which allowed him to work so effectively; because he had seen other legal systems at work, he \"could both criticise the defects of English law and state its rules in a more orderly form than they had ever been stated before\". Hale's political neutrality and personal integrity has been attributed by Berman in 1994 to his Puritanism, and his support of the common law; \"Regimes come and go, the common law abides...For Hale...legal continuity was vital for civic identity\".Hale has frequently been compared with Edward Coke. Campbell considered Hale to be the superior lawyer, because while he failed to engage in public life he treated law as a science, and maintained judicial independence and neutrality. In 2002, Hostettler said, while considering Hale a better lawyer than Coke and more influential, that Coke was better overall. While Hale was in possession of judicial impartiality, and his written works are considered highly important, his lack of venture into public affairs limited his progressive influence.

Similarly, John Campbell in his Lives of the Chief Justices of England, wrote that Hale was \"one of the most pure, the most pious, the most independent, and the most learned\" of judges.In 1908, Henry Flanders, described Hale in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, during his lifetime as \"the most learned, the most able, the most honorable man to be found in the profession of the law\".Hale's writings have been cited by the US Supreme Court on numerous occasions. Justice Harry Blackmun cited Hale in \"Roe v. Wade\". Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer in \"Kahler v. Kansas\". In 2022, Hale's opinion on abortion was cited by Samuel Alito in his opinion of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, generating political controversy.In 1993, in the case of R v Kingston, the Court of Appeal relied on his statement that \"drunkenness is not a defence\" to uphold a conviction. William Holdsworth argued in 1923 that it was his learning in Roman law and jurisprudence which allowed him to work so effectively; because he had seen other legal systems at work, he \"could both criticise the defects of English law and state its rules in a more orderly form than they had ever been stated before\". Hale's political neutrality and personal integrity has been attributed by Berman in 1994 to his Puritanism, and his support of the common law; \"Regimes come and go, the common law abides...For Hale...legal continuity was vital for civic identity\".Hale has frequently been compared with Edward Coke. Campbell considered Hale to be the superior lawyer, because while he failed to engage in public life he treated law as a science, and maintained judicial independence and neutrality. In 2002, Hostettler said, while considering Hale a better lawyer than Coke and more influential, that Coke was better overall. While Hale was in possession of judicial impartiality, and his written works are considered highly important, his lack of venture into public affairs limited his progressive influence. Coke's active intervention allowed him to \"breath new life into medieval law and use it to oppose conciliar justice\", encouraging judges to be more independent and \"unfettered except by the common law whose supremacy it was their duty to uphold\".J.H.

He was recruited by several top college programs and chose to accept a scholarship to play for coach Charley Pell at the University of Florida.Peace became the Gators' starting quarterback just five games into his freshman season of 1980 when a knee injury to starter Bob Hewko propelled the rookie into the lineup, and he performed well enough to keep the starting job for most of the next three and a half seasons.  Over his career at Florida, Peace lead the Gators to a 28-12-1 record, four bowl games, and their first ever top-10 ranking in the final AP Poll (No. 6 in 1983). He set several individual records as well; his career completion percentage (61.6%) was a school record and his 7,206 passing yards were second in school history when he graduated.  During his junior season in 1982, Peace set an NCAA record for completion percentage (70.7%) which was broken by Steve Young the following year.  Peace appeared on the cover of the September 13, 1982 cover of Sports Illustrated. In one of a series of articles written for The Gainesville Sun in 2006, the Sun sportswriters ranked him as No. 81 all-time greatest Gator of the first 100 years of Florida football.  He was later inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great.\"In the spring of 1984, Peace signed with the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League (USFL), who were coached by former Florida quarterback Steve Spurrier.  Peace played in several games, sharing time under center with another Florida alumnus, John Reaves.  After the league folded, Peace was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the first round of the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players, the second USFL quarterback picked after Steve Young. However, he was waived during preseason camp in August 1985. Peace tried out for several other National Football League (NFL) teams over the next two seasons, signing briefly with the Miami Dolphins and playing in preseason games with the San Diego Chargers, but he did not make a regular season roster and decided to retire from football in late 1986.Peace graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in marketing in 1986.

He was the Court Mathematician of John III Sobieski.Kocha\u0144ski was born in Dobrzy\u0144 nad Wis\u0142\u0105. He began his education in Toru\u0144, and in 1652 he entered the Society of Jesus in Vilnius. He studied philosophy at Vilnius University (then called Vilnius Academy). He also studied mathematics, physics and theology. He went on to lecture on those subjects at several European universities: in Florence, Prague, Olomouc, Wroc\u0142aw, Mainz and W\u00fcrzburg. In 1680 he accepted an offer from John III Sobieski, the king of Poland, returning to Poland and taking the position of the king's chaplain, mathematician, clock maker, librarian, and tutor of the king's son, Jakub.\nHe wrote many scientific papers, mainly on mathematics and mechanics, but also on physics, astronomy and philosophy. The best known of his works, Observationes Cyclometricae ad facilitandam Praxin accommodatae, is devoted to the squaring the circle (or alternatively, the quadrature of the circle) and was published in 1685 in the leading scientific periodical of the time, Acta Eruditorum.

{"id": "69_165", "question": "Where was Richard G. Stern educated?", "ctxs": [{"id": "69_3199", "text": "Richard Gustave Stern (February 25, 1928 \u2013 January 24, 2013) was an American novelist, short story writer, and educator.\nStern was born in New York City on February 25, 1928. He attended the University of North Carolina from which he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude in 1947. After a year working in Indiana, Florida and New York City, he went to Harvard University where he received an MA in English Literature.\nIn 1949, he taught as a Fulbright Scholar in Versailles, France. From 1950 to 1951 he was an assistant professor and taught at Heidelberg University. From 1952 to 1954, he was a member of the Iowa Writer's Workshop and received a PhD from the University of Iowa in 1954. After a year teaching at Connecticut College in New London, he came to the University of Chicago where he taught from 1955 to 2002. He retired as Helen A Regenstein Professor of English and American Literature in 2004.\nDuring his tenure at the University of Chicago, Stern was allegedly involved in the \"suppression\" of the \"beat edition\" of the Chicago Review (winter edition of 1958). At the time the Chicago Review was a student/faculty literary publication published by the University of Chicago. The editor then was Irving Rosenthal. The \"beat edition\" of the Review was to include excerpts from Naked Lunch, by William S. Burroughs, and a few Jack Kerouac stories. According to Rosenthal, Stern, along with Joshua Taylor, another faculty member, wanted to suppress the winter issue, being himself \"so quick to protect the administration.\" (For reference to the case of censorship See The Beats, A Literary Reference, by Matt Theado, pp. 103, 104, 105, under the chapter titled \"The Chicago Review and a Case of Censorship.\")\nStern's own account of the \"so-called suppression\" appeared in \"How I Think I Got to Think the Way I Think\" in The Republic of Letters (reprinted in Still on Call, Stern's  \"orderly miscellany\"). It recounts Stern's successful attempt not only to save the review (the University President at the time, Lawrence A. Kimpton, wished to stop funding the journal) but to keep the following issue from dropping any of the pieces (of Naked Lunch and other \"beat\" works) that had been accepted. Rosenthal and Paul Carroll, the Review's co- editors, founded Big Table, using submissions which Stern and the other student editors claimed belonged to the Review. (Oddly, Stern was invited to and did read at a fund-raiser for Big Table and published what he read in its second issue.)  Furthermore, the previous issue of the Review included an excerpt from Naked Lunch along with work by other Beats.\nIn 1960, Stern published his first novel, Golk,  then the novels Europe or Up and Down with Baggish and Schreiber (1961), In Any Case (1962), Stitch (1965), Other Men's Daughters (1973), Natural Shocks (1978), A Father's Words (1986), and Pacific Tremors (2001). There also have been short story collections culminating in his collected stories, Almonds to Zhoof published in 2004, his 21st book. Of this last book, a reviewer in the New Republic called Stern \"the best American author of whom you have never heard.\" This indeed has been the tag associated with Mr. Stern for the last quarter of a century. \"I was a has-been before I'd been a been,\" was a well-known self-deprecation as was the word of Richard Schickel that Mr. Stern \"was almost famous for not being famous\". Stern published another collection of essays, What is What Was, in 2002.  Like his other essay collections, this one demonstrates that his astute observations in fiction are equal to, and derived from, his acute views on news and culture.\nIn 1985, Stern received the Medal of Merit for the Novel, awarded to a novelist every six years by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Among his many other awards was the Heartland Award for the best work of non-fiction which Stern received for his memoir, Sistermony, published in 1995. Stern has been praised by many of the great writers and critics of the last fifty years, among them Anthony Burgess, Flannery O'Connor, Howard Nemerov, Thomas Berger, Hugh Kenner, Sven Birkerts, and Richard Ellmann, as well as his close friends Tom Rogers, Saul Bellow, Donald Justice, and Philip Roth (see Stern's essay \"Glimpse, Encounter, Acquaintance, Friendship\" in Sewanee Review, Winter 2009).  He also enjoyed literary acquaintances and friendships with such figures as Samuel Beckett, Ezra Pound, Robert Lowell, Lillian Hellman, and Jorge Luis Borges.  Some of Stern's students at the University of Chicago went on to become distinguished writers themselves such as Douglas Unger, Robert Coover, Austin Wright, Campbell McGrath, Peter LaSalle, and Alane Rollings, as well as the well-known journalists Seymour Hersh, David Brooks and Mike Taibbi.\nAt 80, Stern continued to write, and his books remain in print through Northwestern University Press and University of Chicago Press.  From 2006 onwards he maintained a blog with The New Republic.\nThe most recent book about Stern and his work was published in 2001: The Writings of Richard Stern: The Education of an Intellectual Everyman, by David Garrett Izzo (McFarland Publishing).

He then attended Moscow Conservatory and in 1955, a year before graduating, he won the gold medal at the World Festival of Youth and Students in Warsaw.\nWhile studying at the Moscow Conservatory he became a soloist for the Alexandrov Ensemble 1949-1956. This involved lessons at the Conservatory, exams and rehearsals, performances and concert tours with the choir in the Soviet Union, foreign tours and mandatory daily rehearsals with an accompanist. He was also preparing for big solo performances at major concert halls in Moscow. He became well-known and often appeared on radio. Following this he gained fame on the international opera circuit after a successful 1956 debut as Don Basilio in The Barber of Seville. He was praised in the American, British and Japanese press.

Elected to a fourth term in November 1946, he died before his inauguration, scheduled for January 1947. Only Talmadge and Joe Brown, in the mid-19th century, have been elected four times as governor of Georgia.\nA member of the Democratic Party, he is known for having actively promoted segregation and white supremacy, and for advocating for racism in the University System of Georgia.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "69_3217", "text": "Eugene Talmadge was born in 1884 in Forsyth, Georgia, to Thomas and Carrie (Roberts) Talmadge. He attended the University of Georgia and graduated from the university's law school. While at UGA, he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society and Sigma Nu fraternity.\nTalmadge set up a law practice in Telfair County, Georgia and joined the Democratic Party. He twice ran for the Georgia state legislature and lost both times. He was elected as state agriculture commissioner in 1926. Talmadge was re-elected commissioner in 1928 and 1930.In 1908, the Democratic-dominated legislature passed a constitutional amendment that effectively disenfranchised most African Americans in Georgia. This institutionalized the Democratic Party's dominance in the state, in a pattern that had been repeated across most of the former Confederate states since 1890, when Mississippi was the first to pass such legislation.\nAs commissioner, Talmadge used the newspaper of his department to give advice to farmers and promote  his political views, extolling the virtues of a laissez-faire economic policy and individual action to improve the well-being of farmers. He maintained widespread support among Georgia's rural white communities.\nThe State Senate concluded that Talmadge violated a state law requiring that fertilizer fees collected by the agriculture department be deposited in the state treasury.  He was criticized for paying himself and family members more than $40,000 in salaries and expenses, and using department funds to make trips to the Kentucky Derby.  Accused of \"stealing\" $20,000 in order to raise the price of hogs, Talmadge told one group of farmers, \"Sure, I stole it!  But I stole it for you.\" The State House declined requests to impeach Talmadge but agreed to sue him to recover state funds spent on the hog price manipulation scheme.  When Governor Richard B. Russell Jr. referred the suit to the state attorney general, however, the request to sue Talmadge was rejected.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_3218", "text": "In 1932, Governor Richard B. Russell, Jr. ran as a candidate for the United States Senate. Talmadge ran for governor, appealing to white rural Georgia by idealizing the small farmer, and preaching what he said were the true values of rural America, such as rugged individualism, frugality, governmental economy, segregation, limited government, and low taxes. Talmadge won a majority of the county unit votes and therefore the primary. Winning the nomination of the Democratic Party was tantamount to automatic victory in the general election. The Republican Party in the state had been essentially hollowed out and made non-competitive by the effective disenfranchisement of African-American voters after 1908.\nBecause all counties were given equal weight, the County Unit System gave outsized power to the rural counties, which were Talmadge's base. He boasted, \"I can carry any county that ain't got street cars.\"  He made twelve campaign promises, the most controversial of which was to lower the price of an automobile license to $3, putting them within reach of the poorest farmers.  The state legislature intensely debated the $3 license fee issue, but did not pass it. After it adjourned, Talmadge fixed the $3 fee by proclamation.During the Great Depression of the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt developed the New Deal with programs to hire unemployed men to work on various public works projects. These were often for needed infrastructure identified by the states. In the South, these jobs offered higher wages than men could obtain in the private sector, and black men were paid the same rate as white men. Many of the wealthy white land-owning families in Georgia soon complained to Talmadge that their sharecroppers preferred to work on the better-paying New Deal public works projects rather than as sharecroppers, and asked the governor to intercede with the president.In 1933, one sharecropper wrote to Talmadge: \"I wound't [wouldn't] plow nobody's mule from sunrise to sunset for 50 cents a day when I could get $1.30 for pretending to work on a DITCH\". A disgusted Talmadge forwarded the letter to Roosevelt, together with his own letter that stated: \"I take it that you approve of paying farm labor 40 to 50 cents per day\". Roosevelt wrote back: \"Somehow I cannot get into my head that wages on such a scale make possible a reasonable American standard of living\".For all his populism and his self-image as the defender of the small white farmers of Georgia, Talmadge tended to side with the interests of the wealthier land-owning families of the state. He was strongly opposed to Roosevelt's efforts to raise wages in the South, believing that this would undercut the South's only economic advantage, namely of having the lowest wages in the United States. Roosevelt by contrast believed that raising wages would increase consumption and hence spur the economy out of the Great Depression.When Georgia textile workers went on strike on September 1, 1934, Talmadge declared martial law during the third week of the strike. He directed four thousand National Guard troops to arrest all picketers throughout the state. He ordered the prisoners to be held behind the barbed wire of a former World War I prisoner of war camp for trial by a military tribunal. While the state interned about one hundred or so picketers, the show of force effectively ended picketing throughout most of the state. When Talmadge discovered that one of the employers had hired the notorious strikebreaker Pearl Bergoff, he had Bergoff and his two hundred men detained by the Georgia National Guard and deported to New York City.Although often tied to both controversy and corruption, Talmadge was re-elected in 1934, carrying every county but three in the state's Democratic primary. When the Public Service Commission, a body elected by the voters, refused to lower utility rates, he appointed a new board to get it done.  When the Highway Board resisted his efforts to control it, Talmadge declared martial law and appointed more cooperative members to the board. When the state treasurer and comptroller general refused to cooperate, the governor ordered state police to remove them physically from their offices in the state capitol. Critics denounced him as a dictator, a demagogue, and a threat to the tranquility of the state. His supporters considered him to be a friend of the \"common man\" and one of the state's most outstanding governors.\nIn October 1934, Talmadge ousted John Cohen, the pro-New Deal chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, and replaced him with Hugh Howell, a Talmadge partisan. Roosevelt met with Talmadge to ask him to save Cohen's job, a request that was refused, leading the president to suspect that this was the first step by Talmadge toward a possible presidential run in 1936. By late 1934, Talmadge's relationship with Roosevelt was fraying. In December 1934, when Roosevelt decided to spend Christmas at Warm Springs, Georgia, Talmadge sent a note requesting a private meeting with the president. His staff responded by a note apologizing for Roosevelt not having the time to see the governor, and vaguely promising him a private meeting at the White House sometime in 1935.By early 1935, Talmadge was working on an alliance with US Senator Huey Long (D-Louisiana), who was planning on running against Roosevelt in 1936. When asked what was discussed at his meetings with Long, Talmadge replied: \"We both cussed Roosevelt\". But, Long had a low opinion of Talmadge's intelligence, saying: \"That Talmadge ain't got the brains to match his ambition\". Beyond a shared antipathy to Roosevelt, the two had almost nothing in common politically. Long, a left-wing populist, had the slogan of \"share the wealth\", promising if elected president he would confiscate all the wealth of the richest Americans and redistribute it to the poor, whereas Talmadge was essentially an old-fashioned Southern conservative. Long criticized Roosevelt for not going far enough with the New Deal, while Talmadge had felt he had gone too far. Finally, both men wanted to run for president and wanted the other to serve as vice president, which proved to be the issue that ended their alliance and made them enemies.Talmadge governed as a Southern conservative, vehemently attacking the nationalization of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. He objected to policies favorable to black people (President Roosevelt did not introduce any civil rights measures), the farm programs, and relief-work programs such as the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps. Talmadge believed the New Deal relief programs were encouraging people to be lazy, telling a reporter: \"The way to handle a relief program was like how Mussolini was handling it in Italy, namely to line these people up and take the troops and make them work\".Talmadge tried to build a region-wide coalition, making a national speaking tour in preparation for a challenge to FDR in 1936. Talmadge's main allies were the Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith, who had been the principal organizer of Long's Share Our Wealth Clubs; John Henry Kirby, a wealthy Texas businessman who had been a leading Long supporter; and novelist Thomas Dixon Jr., a white supremacist whose books glorifying the Ku Klux Klan were very popular at the time. Talmadge's bid was being financed with some $41,000 dollars contributed by Alfred Sloan, CEO of General Motors, together with money from the Raskob and du Pont families.His Southern Committee to Uphold the Constitution organized a convention in Macon, Georgia, in January 1936 that brought together fragments of the old Huey P. Long coalition. The Macon convention turned out to be a media disaster that ended Talmadge's presidential hopes. The populist platform that Talmadge drafted at his Macon convention, with its call for more silver to be mined to support the silver standard, more protectionism, more states rights, more isolationism, and less immigration was widely mocked as more appropriate for the 19th century than the 20th.Talmadge pledged to defend the \"sovereignty of our states and local self-government\" at the upcoming Democratic National Convention. However, Roosevelt, who visited Warm Springs, Georgia, often because of his past polio, was more popular with the poor farmers. Unable to run for re-election in 1936, Talmadge chose to challenge Senator Russell in the primary, but Russell defeated Talmadge by a landslide and Talmadge's presidential hopes collapsed.  Talmadge's handpicked candidate for governor, Charles Redwine, lost the 1936 Georgia gubernatorial election to pro-New Deal Democrat Eurith D. Rivers by an overwhelming margin.In 1936, according to a United Press (UP) article printed in the Atlanta Constitution on August 21, 1936, titled \"Gene Selects Hitler as Favorite 'Author'\", Talmadge reportedly told a Los Angeles newspaper that while he didn't have time to read many books, he read Adolf Hitler's book Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\") seven times. The Nazi publication Die Bewegung reprinted the interview with Talmadge and praised him, stating that \"Governor Eugene Talmadge, of Georgia, is obviously a very intelligent man.\"In 1938, Talmadge challenged incumbent U.S. senator Walter F. George. Though George had sided with 34 of Roosevelt's 44 New Deal proposals, he refused to support some of the proposals in Roosevelt's second term. The president believed George had been \"put out to pasture\". Roosevelt tried to purge George and campaigned for his own candidate, Lawrence Camp. George, however, refused to criticize Roosevelt during the campaign and blamed the purge on Roosevelt's advisers.  Despite the divide among the New Deal vote, George easily won the renomination, securing 141,922 popular votes and a majority of 246 county unit votes, while Talmadge won just 102,464 popular votes and 148 unit votes. Talmadge's victory over Roosevelt's candidate Camp, who secured just 78,223 popular votes and 16 unit votes, surprised his critics.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_3217", "text": "Eugene Talmadge was born in 1884 in Forsyth, Georgia, to Thomas and Carrie (Roberts) Talmadge.

Talmadge's bid was being financed with some $41,000 dollars contributed by Alfred Sloan, CEO of General Motors, together with money from the Raskob and du Pont families.His Southern Committee to Uphold the Constitution organized a convention in Macon, Georgia, in January 1936 that brought together fragments of the old Huey P. Long coalition. The Macon convention turned out to be a media disaster that ended Talmadge's presidential hopes. The populist platform that Talmadge drafted at his Macon convention, with its call for more silver to be mined to support the silver standard, more protectionism, more states rights, more isolationism, and less immigration was widely mocked as more appropriate for the 19th century than the 20th.Talmadge pledged to defend the \"sovereignty of our states and local self-government\" at the upcoming Democratic National Convention. However, Roosevelt, who visited Warm Springs, Georgia, often because of his past polio, was more popular with the poor farmers. Unable to run for re-election in 1936, Talmadge chose to challenge Senator Russell in the primary, but Russell defeated Talmadge by a landslide and Talmadge's presidential hopes collapsed.  Talmadge's handpicked candidate for governor, Charles Redwine, lost the 1936 Georgia gubernatorial election to pro-New Deal Democrat Eurith D. Rivers by an overwhelming margin.In 1936, according to a United Press (UP) article printed in the Atlanta Constitution on August 21, 1936, titled \"Gene Selects Hitler as Favorite 'Author'\", Talmadge reportedly told a Los Angeles newspaper that while he didn't have time to read many books, he read Adolf Hitler's book Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\") seven times. The Nazi publication Die Bewegung reprinted the interview with Talmadge and praised him, stating that \"Governor Eugene Talmadge, of Georgia, is obviously a very intelligent man.\"In 1938, Talmadge challenged incumbent U.S. senator Walter F. George. Though George had sided with 34 of Roosevelt's 44 New Deal proposals, he refused to support some of the proposals in Roosevelt's second term. The president believed George had been \"put out to pasture\". Roosevelt tried to purge George and campaigned for his own candidate, Lawrence Camp. George, however, refused to criticize Roosevelt during the campaign and blamed the purge on Roosevelt's advisers.  Despite the divide among the New Deal vote, George easily won the renomination, securing 141,922 popular votes and a majority of 246 county unit votes, while Talmadge won just 102,464 popular votes and 148 unit votes. Talmadge's victory over Roosevelt's candidate Camp, who secured just 78,223 popular votes and 16 unit votes, surprised his critics.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The following year he won election to the state legislature, where he served nine annual terms, the last four as Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.  During these years he became politically associated with Calvin Coolidge, who was Senate President and Lieutenant Governor.  Coolidge tapped Cox as his running mate for governor in 1918, and Cox served two one-year terms as lieutenant governor.  Coolidge stepped back to run for Vice President of the United States in 1920.Cox ran for governor in 1920, which was the first two-year term for the office.  His victory over John Jackson Walsh was part of a broad national win for the Republicans, including a sweep of statewide offices in Massachusetts, which was spurred by nativist opposition to Wilson administration policies on immigration.  Cox contributed to the anti-immigrant sentiment in Massachusetts by characterizing discontented immigrants as a \"motley array of questionable groups and influences\".  He won reelection in 1922, in another race against disorganized Democratic opposition.  Although the state was in an economic downturn (an early whisper of the Great Depression), with textile production dropping and wages down, his campaigns emphasized \"economy and sound administration\" in governance, terms which characterized Republican campaigns through the 1920s.  In 1922, Cox defeated former Mayor of Boston John \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald by more than 60,000 votes.As governor, Cox was somewhat more progressive than Coolidge, advancing a variety of modest reforms.  He increased schooling requirements and reduced working hours for children, allowed labor unions to instigate lawsuits against employers, and improved workmen's compensation coverage.  He signed legislation restricting the ability of state banks to engage in speculative investments, and instituted a commission on finance and reform to oversee the state's finances.

The following year he won election to the state legislature, where he served nine annual terms, the last four as Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.  During these years he became politically associated with Calvin Coolidge, who was Senate President and Lieutenant Governor.  Coolidge tapped Cox as his running mate for governor in 1918, and Cox served two one-year terms as lieutenant governor.  Coolidge stepped back to run for Vice President of the United States in 1920.Cox ran for governor in 1920, which was the first two-year term for the office.  His victory over John Jackson Walsh was part of a broad national win for the Republicans, including a sweep of statewide offices in Massachusetts, which was spurred by nativist opposition to Wilson administration policies on immigration.  Cox contributed to the anti-immigrant sentiment in Massachusetts by characterizing discontented immigrants as a \"motley array of questionable groups and influences\".  He won reelection in 1922, in another race against disorganized Democratic opposition.  Although the state was in an economic downturn (an early whisper of the Great Depression), with textile production dropping and wages down, his campaigns emphasized \"economy and sound administration\" in governance, terms which characterized Republican campaigns through the 1920s.  In 1922, Cox defeated former Mayor of Boston John \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald by more than 60,000 votes.As governor, Cox was somewhat more progressive than Coolidge, advancing a variety of modest reforms.  He increased schooling requirements and reduced working hours for children, allowed labor unions to instigate lawsuits against employers, and improved workmen's compensation coverage.  He signed legislation restricting the ability of state banks to engage in speculative investments, and instituted a commission on finance and reform to oversee the state's finances.

He became a corporate lawyer with Sullivan & Cromwell, but found work at the large firm stifling, and left for a smaller practice. He resided in Brooklyn, where he was a trustee of the public library and of the Long Island College of Medicine.In 1938 he was appointed by New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia to the Board of Higher Education, replacing Arthur M. Howe. La Guardia reappointed him for a second term, of nine years, in 1940. By the following year, he was chairman of the conduct committee for the Board, and was elected chairman of the administrative committee of Brooklyn College. His Board of Higher Education duties included leading the investigation for the Rapp-Coudert Committee into the extent of communist influence within the public schools.He resigned his Board of Higher Education position in 1942 to enter the Army as a major. Later that year, he was assigned by the U.S. War Department to be a defense lawyer for eight Nazi saboteurs involved in Operation Pastorius. President Roosevelt had directed that the saboteurs be tried via a military tribunal; Lauson's designated role for the defense was to research whether this was constitutionally permissible. Lauson believed there was a strong possibility that a military trial was unconstitutional, and therefore the defense sought a Supreme Court order declaring as much. With the matter set to come before the Supreme Court as Ex parte Quirin, there was a question as to whether Lauson's father, Chief Justice Harlan Stone, would recuse himself from the case due to his son's involvement with the defense. Harlan did offer to do so, but his recusal was declined by Attorney General Francis Biddle, ostensibly because Lauson's involvement had been limited to the military tribunal, and he had been excused from the matters that were coming before the Supreme Court. Legal scholars have questioned this distinction, citing it as one example among many potential conflicts of interest produced by the case's unique circumstances.In 1944, at age 41, Lauson was promoted to the rank of colonel, and he was later discharged at that rank, after being awarded the Legion of Merit Medal.

However, the judge also ruled that it was the union's prerogative to fire Hunter, but allowed Hunter's claim that he was still owed $10.5 million to continue.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

He was also a member of Logan & Co. for twenty years and president of the Logan Drug Company at the time of his death.\nAfter the adoption of the Virginia Constitution of 1850 led to increased representation of western Virginia in the Virginia General Assembly, Ohio County, which had previously been represented in the Virginia House of Delegates by Charles W. Russell, received two additional seats. Hubbard was elected to fill one of them in 1851, but neither he, John M. Oldham nor Russell was re-elected in 1853. Instead, Ohio County lost one seat, and John C. Campbell and Thomas M. Gally were elected to the remaining seats. Ohio County voters elected Hubbard one of their three delegates to the Virginia convention in Richmond, Virginia in 1861 and opposed secession. He then was elected one of Ohio County's six delegates at the Wheeling Convention of 1861 served as delegate to the West Virginia constitutional convention in Wheeling the same year.\nHubbard then served in the West Virginia senate in 1863 and 1864, and his eldest son William Pallister Hubbard, who had become a lawyer, served as an officer of the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry. Hubbard was an active Republican and partisan of James G. Blaine and served as delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1864 and 1880.\nHubbard was elected as an Unconditional Unionist to the 39th United States Congress and reelected as a Republican to the 40th United States Congress (March 4, 1865 \u2013 March 3, 1869). He served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Interior (Fortieth Congress), but was defeated in the primary in 1868, and so resumed his banking and manufacturing pursuits. He was among the promoters and builders of the Pittsburg, Wheeling & Kentucky Railroad in 1873, becoming president of the road in 1874.An earnest friend of education, Hubbard was a trustee of the Linsly Institute (which his son attended) in 1848, and became its treasurer in 1873. He also helped found the Wheeling Female College, and served as a trustee, and as President of the Board from 1865 up to the sale of the property.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After attending The Hotchkiss School, he graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in comparative literature from Hamilton College in 1985.  Finch then pursued an M.F.A. in sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design, graduating in 1989. The first retrospective of his work, which ended in March 2008, was assembled at MASS MoCA in North Adams, MA. He currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nFinch produces work in a wide variety of mediums, including watercolor, photography, glass, electronics, video and fluorescent lights. He is perhaps best known for dealing with the elusive concepts of memory and perception through light installations. After measuring with a colorimeter the light that exist naturally in a specific place and time, Finch re-constructs the luminosity of the location through artificial means. For example, Moonlight (Luna County, New Mexico, July 13, 2003), replicates the exact light of the full moon that shone over the desert of Luna County, New Mexico on the evening of July 13, 2003.Creative Time, Friends of the High Line, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation commissioned The River That Flows Both Ways to Spencer Finch as the inaugural art installation for the High Line Park. The work is integrated into the window bays of the former Nabisco Factory loading dock, as a series of 700 purple and grey colored glass panes. Each color is exactly calibrated to match the center pixel of 700 digital pictures, one taken every minute, of the Hudson River, therefore presenting an extended portrait of the river that gives the work its name.  Creative Time worked with the artist to realize the site-specific concept that emerged when he saw the rusted, disused mullions of the old factory, which metal and glass specialists Jaroff Design helped to prepare and reinstall.Finch was chosen to create the only work of art commissioned for the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.  For his work, \"Trying To Remember the Color of the Sky on That September Morning,\" Finch hand-painted 2,983 squares of Fabriano paper \u2014 one square in a unique shade of blue for every person killed in the September 11 attacks and in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.", "hasanswer": true}]}

She was born in New York on 11 November 1979, and spent her childhood in Indonesia, America and the UK. She graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art, London, in 2003 and completed her postgraduate degree at Royal Academy of Arts in 2006. In the same year, she was awarded the prestigious Deutsche Bank Award in Fine Art. Highly regarded for her site-specific work in the public realm, she has since undertaken commissions that include the Folkestone Triennial (2017), Songdo Tech City (2016), Liverpool Biennial (2012), The Southbank Centre (2008), and TFL Art on the Underground (2007). She held the inaugural Bridget Riley Fellowship 2016\u201317 at the British School at Rome, is the recipient of the British Council's International Development Award and was shortlisted for the Jerwood Painting Prize. She lives and works between London and Bali.\nTantra's practice is diverse, ranging from painted canvases, to site-specific sculptural interventions, to large-scale public artworks. She describes her work as 'painting on an architectural scale'. Colour is central to her practice, as a 'material which lies between the language of art and industry'. Her distinctive palette is inspired by her Balinese heritage and childhood holidays: 'I remember things through colour \u2013  especially the way in which colours vibrate against each other. I like the idea of \u2018colour semiotics\u2019 and the associations one has to particular colours in relationship to either brand or narrative.'Her work has been described as \"exuberant\", a \"hedonistic celebration of excess and decoration\", and her contribution to public art by transforming spaces with \"chaotic yet captivating images\" has been recognised by collectors and commissioners alike. Her 2010 work Universe of Objects in Archive, Arsenic and Railings praised for lifting the perspective \"like the energy of a released spring and pulses horizontally around the room in endless optical trigonometric fugue\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "69_3475", "text": "Tantra was born on 11 November 1979, in New York, to Balinese parents. Her father worked in finance, while her mother looked after her and her four older siblings. When Tantra was aged 6, the family relocated to the UK. Tantra has said, 'Like many first generation children whose parents migrated, I could never really identify with being from just one particular place. My work explores my identity and the layering of cultures specific to my own experiences. I am inspired by the colours of Bali, an English Heritage palette and 1980s pop Americana.'\nAfter completing a BTEC diploma in Fine Art at Middlesex University in 1999, Tantra took her BA at the Slade School of Fine Art from 2000 to 2003, under the tutor Andrew Stahl, head of Painting. It was here that she met the sculptor Nick Hornby, who she would go on to collaborate with in the future. \nDuring her studies, Tantra was introduced to the work of the conceptual artist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), whose reduction of painting to a 'series of instructions or blueprints' she cites as a \u2018huge\u2019 and enduring influence on her practice. Like LeWitt, Tantra's work lies at the intersection between art and architecture, exceeding the confines of the canvas and of the gallery space. Likewise, Tantra cites the Indonesian painter Mochtar Apin (1923-1944) as an inspiration: 'In my work, there are specific elements inspired by Indonesian patterns. These patterns are reduced, distorted or enlarged to such a scale that the viewer becomes submerged in the decoration itself.'After graduating, Tantra was accepted onto the Royal Academy Fine Art Masters Programme. Her studies were funded by a Paul Smith Postgraduate Scholarship. It was at the RA that Tantra's interest in large-scale artwork in the public realm began. She regards this as a reaction both to the stereotype of female work as modest or decorative. 'Even at art school, painting on canvas didn't really appeal to me- I was more interested in playing with architectural space, injecting colour, line, and form into new environments. Admittedly in the early days, there was also the desire to challenge the gender stereotype, that both men and women could make large scale works.' She describes the expectation of her lecturers and peers that she would create 'something cute and feminine, in small sizes' as fuelling her desire to \u2018consistently create abstract and structured paintings\u2019.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_3476", "text": "Tantra completed her MA in 2006, and that year was awarded the prestigious Deutsche Bank award. She began running a studio space for artists in the London Borough of Camden, organising workshops and community projects. Through her work she made contact with Camden Council, who commissioned her first public art piece, a mural stretching across Regents Park Bridge titled Isokon Dreams (2007). The work was praised by local councillor Flick Rea, who said 'The mural is fantastic. It really brightens the [Regents Park Road] bridge'.Tantra's early work was composed of intricately cut vinyl and painted designs, featuring vibrant colours and geometric shapes. Her work remains recognisable for its distinctive use of colour and pattern: clean lines, geometric abstraction, a preoccupation with decorative symbols, and a bold and arresting choice of colours. Among her first commissions was a 2006 project for Transport For London's Art on the Underground initiative, for which she produced a vinyl installation at the exit of Piccadilly Circus Station. Other early projects include a large mural and stage for the Saison Poetry Library in the Southbank Centre, titled A Good Time and a Half! (2007). Poet Lemn Sissay described it as an 'incredible piece of work', which 'allows for the full breadth of human experience upon the stage [...] brings the entire world into the library'.Since then Tantra has gone on to make increasingly ambitious works, including her painting across the length of the DLR Bridge in Canary Wharf titled A Beautiful Sunset Mistaken for a Dawn, which was commissioned by Canary Wharf Group in anticipation of the 2012 Olympics. Other projects include an installation at the Open Eye Gallery as part of the 2012 Liverpool Biennial.\n2013 saw the first of a series of collaborative projects with the sculptor Nick Hornby. Collaborative Works was held in the lobby of the One Canada Square building. This featured Hornby's marble sculptures overlaid with Tantra's trademark colour abstractions, as well as maquettes for larger sculptures drawing on Tantra's colour compositions. The exhibition was described as 'a radical development' in both their careers.Of public art, Tantra has said: 'There's a sort of \"constructivist\" approach to the entire process which I like [...] there are the practicalities of making the work itself whilst giving the artwork a \"social function\"'.

Her father worked in finance, while her mother looked after her and her four older siblings. When Tantra was aged 6, the family relocated to the UK. Tantra has said, 'Like many first generation children whose parents migrated, I could never really identify with being from just one particular place. My work explores my identity and the layering of cultures specific to my own experiences. I am inspired by the colours of Bali, an English Heritage palette and 1980s pop Americana.'\nAfter completing a BTEC diploma in Fine Art at Middlesex University in 1999, Tantra took her BA at the Slade School of Fine Art from 2000 to 2003, under the tutor Andrew Stahl, head of Painting. It was here that she met the sculptor Nick Hornby, who she would go on to collaborate with in the future. \nDuring her studies, Tantra was introduced to the work of the conceptual artist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), whose reduction of painting to a 'series of instructions or blueprints' she cites as a \u2018huge\u2019 and enduring influence on her practice. Like LeWitt, Tantra's work lies at the intersection between art and architecture, exceeding the confines of the canvas and of the gallery space. Likewise, Tantra cites the Indonesian painter Mochtar Apin (1923-1944) as an inspiration: 'In my work, there are specific elements inspired by Indonesian patterns. These patterns are reduced, distorted or enlarged to such a scale that the viewer becomes submerged in the decoration itself.'After graduating, Tantra was accepted onto the Royal Academy Fine Art Masters Programme. Her studies were funded by a Paul Smith Postgraduate Scholarship. It was at the RA that Tantra's interest in large-scale artwork in the public realm began. She regards this as a reaction both to the stereotype of female work as modest or decorative. 'Even at art school, painting on canvas didn't really appeal to me- I was more interested in playing with architectural space, injecting colour, line, and form into new environments. Admittedly in the early days, there was also the desire to challenge the gender stereotype, that both men and women could make large scale works.' She describes the expectation of her lecturers and peers that she would create 'something cute and feminine, in small sizes' as fuelling her desire to \u2018consistently create abstract and structured paintings\u2019.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_3476", "text": "Tantra completed her MA in 2006, and that year was awarded the prestigious Deutsche Bank award. She began running a studio space for artists in the London Borough of Camden, organising workshops and community projects. Through her work she made contact with Camden Council, who commissioned her first public art piece, a mural stretching across Regents Park Bridge titled Isokon Dreams (2007). The work was praised by local councillor Flick Rea, who said 'The mural is fantastic. It really brightens the [Regents Park Road] bridge'.Tantra's early work was composed of intricately cut vinyl and painted designs, featuring vibrant colours and geometric shapes. Her work remains recognisable for its distinctive use of colour and pattern: clean lines, geometric abstraction, a preoccupation with decorative symbols, and a bold and arresting choice of colours. Among her first commissions was a 2006 project for Transport For London's Art on the Underground initiative, for which she produced a vinyl installation at the exit of Piccadilly Circus Station. Other early projects include a large mural and stage for the Saison Poetry Library in the Southbank Centre, titled A Good Time and a Half! (2007). Poet Lemn Sissay described it as an 'incredible piece of work', which 'allows for the full breadth of human experience upon the stage [...] brings the entire world into the library'.Since then Tantra has gone on to make increasingly ambitious works, including her painting across the length of the DLR Bridge in Canary Wharf titled A Beautiful Sunset Mistaken for a Dawn, which was commissioned by Canary Wharf Group in anticipation of the 2012 Olympics. Other projects include an installation at the Open Eye Gallery as part of the 2012 Liverpool Biennial.\n2013 saw the first of a series of collaborative projects with the sculptor Nick Hornby. Collaborative Works was held in the lobby of the One Canada Square building. This featured Hornby's marble sculptures overlaid with Tantra's trademark colour abstractions, as well as maquettes for larger sculptures drawing on Tantra's colour compositions. The exhibition was described as 'a radical development' in both their careers.Of public art, Tantra has said: 'There's a sort of \"constructivist\" approach to the entire process which I like [...] there are the practicalities of making the work itself whilst giving the artwork a \"social function\"'. She feels that her Balinese heritage has affected her work less in its appearance than in the way that art 'is embedded in life- which is what public art does- and the idea of working together with people [...] I guess that it is like a celebration'.Tantra has held a number of artists residencies, including a 2014 residency with Cemeti Art House and Mes 56 in Yogyakarta, one of the largest creative communities in Indonesia.

Based at Regent Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, Northern Rock was originally a building society. It demutualised and became Northern Rock bank in 1997, when it floated on the London Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NRK. \nDuring the early 2000s the company borrowed substantially to fund mortgages, with the aim of ambitious growth, and also donated large amounts to charitable purposes and communities directly and through sponsorships. The global banking crisis beginning around 2007\u201308 meant that it was unable to produce income as expected from its loans, and was at risk of being unable to repay the amounts it had borrowed. The news that the bank had approached the government for support with its liquidity led within 24 hours to a public lack of confidence and concerns that savings were at risk, and the bank failed following a bank run as people rushed to withdraw their savings. It was the first British bank in 150 years to fail due to a bank run.Unable to find a commercial buyer or secure the further government support needed, it was taken into public ownership in 2008, as an alternative to insolvency. By that point the government had extended liquidity support of tens of billions of pounds to Northern Rock. An inquiry concluded that the board had failed to properly protect the bank from the risks inherent in its strategy, or to restrain the executive directors where required, therefore although the bank had sufficient assets, it had become vulnerable.\nThe branch operations were eventually returned to private ownership when the branches and other retail operations were acquired by Virgin Group in 2012, being rebranded as Virgin Money the same year.

During the following 30 years, Northern Rock expanded through the acquisition of 53 smaller building societies, most notably the North of England Building Society in 1994.Along with many other UK building societies in the 1990s, Northern Rock chose to demutualise as a building society and float on the stock exchange as a bank. Throughout this period an argument against demutualisation was that the assets of a mutual society were built up by its members throughout its history, not just by current members, and that demutualisation was a betrayal of the community that the societies were created to serve. Northern Rock chose to address these concerns by establishing the Northern Rock Foundation, which funded community-based projects. At its Stock Exchange flotation on 1 October 1997 (when it converted from a building society to a bank), Northern Rock distributed shares to members with savings accounts and mortgage loans; the flotation share price was \u00a34.51908.

He was elected Master of University College in March 1610. The Front Quad of the college was rebuilt in stages from 1610, replacing the original medieval buildings, only to be completed much later in 1677. In 1632, he relinquished his position as Master of University College and became Bishop of Oxford.\nBancroft had high church views, and was a friend of Archbishop William Laud. The Puritan William Prynne (in an attack on Laud) wrote that Bancroft was a \"corrupt, unpreaching, popish prelate\".Bancroft's administrative ingenuity is demonstrated by the manor in which he created Cuddesdon Palace as the bishop's palace. As the vicarage of All Saints, Cuddesdon was vacant, and the Bishop of Oxford made the appointment, Bancroft appointed himself to Cuddesdon soon after becoming bishop. He secured a royal warrant to annex the vicarage to the bishopric permanently, also secured a grant of timber from the royal forest of Shotover and an annual 100-shilling rent-charge against the royal forests, and was thus able to build Cuddesdon Palace.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

She enrolled in the University of Oklahoma School of Drama where she studied for one year.After one year of college, Randall moved to Los Angeles with the goal of becoming a movie actress. Once in Los Angeles, Randall moved in with a college friend of her mother's. Randall acquired a talent agent who arranged interviews for her with both Mary Pickford, co-founder of United Artists, and Paramount.Although Randall only had some school stage experience, including the lead in the play Claudia at the University of Oklahomas, Pickford offered Randall $125 a week, a considerable amount, to sign with United Artists. However, Paramount Studios came back with a better offer, which Randall was ready to accept. But another encounter would steer her away from the generous Paramount offer.\nGene's mother's friend was also an acquaintance of the alluring silent film star, Rubye De Remer, which gave Gene the opportunity to meet Rubye and make a marked impression on her as well. On Gene's behalf, Rubye in turn piqued the interest of director Clarence Brown. It was early 1945 when MGM and Clarence Brown first embarked on a nationwide casting search for some fresh talent for The Yearling And now months later, Clarence believed that perhaps the role of Orry Baxter might be suited for Gene. So Rubye contacted Gene the day after the Paramount offer was made and persuaded her to meet with Clarence at MGM that day. Despite the fact that MGM newcomer, Jacqueline White, was actually selected and had filmed some scenes that summer, Clarence was still not convinced that she was the right choice. As a result, Gene was called back three times to test for the role and eagerly awaited to hear from the studio each time. This experience earned her a $250 a week, long-term MGM contract which she signed as herself, Gene Roberts. Ultimately, Gene's youthfulness was the deciding factor that prevented MGM from assigning her this lead role. When production resumed in mid-September 1945, Clarence had chosen 28-year-old Jane Wyman, who was on loan from Warner Brothers, to portray a more mature-looking character with co-star Gregory Peck. The Yearling was released in May 1947 and went on to win multiple Academy Awards and nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Jane Wyman.Gene remained under contract with MGM for nearly two years and found that there were very few roles for young women her age at that time. It wasn't until late October 1946 and over a year since Gene first signed on, that she was cast in a small supporting role. This role placed Gene into the last of Ann Sothern's film series, the final episode entitled Undercover Maisie which was released in May 1947. Next, she was cast in the low-budget Comet Productions film Stork Bites Man where she co-starred with Jackie Cooper, who had resumed his acting career after returning from the war. With production completed in early February 1947 and MGM showing no serious interest in her by that spring, Gene asked for and was granted release from her contract.

Although her family is of primarily Welsh descent, her father favored names of alternate ethnicity  selecting a few for his children rather than Welsh names, breaking away from family tradition.\nDuring World War II, both of Gene's parents were employed as attendants at the Veterans' Administration Hospital in Muskogee, OK. Gene's older brother, Juarez Roberts, was a World War II paratrooper and a graduate from the University of Oklahoma after the war. He found his niche in Hollywood by writing for several television shows during the 1950s until the early 1960s.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_3764", "text": "Most of Randall's schooling was in the Shawnee public schools. The family moved to Muskogee in 1941 and in 1943 at the age of seventeen, Randall graduated from Muskogee High School. She enrolled in the University of Oklahoma School of Drama where she studied for one year.After one year of college, Randall moved to Los Angeles with the goal of becoming a movie actress. Once in Los Angeles, Randall moved in with a college friend of her mother's. Randall acquired a talent agent who arranged interviews for her with both Mary Pickford, co-founder of United Artists, and Paramount.Although Randall only had some school stage experience, including the lead in the play Claudia at the University of Oklahomas, Pickford offered Randall $125 a week, a considerable amount, to sign with United Artists. However, Paramount Studios came back with a better offer, which Randall was ready to accept. But another encounter would steer her away from the generous Paramount offer.\nGene's mother's friend was also an acquaintance of the alluring silent film star, Rubye De Remer, which gave Gene the opportunity to meet Rubye and make a marked impression on her as well. On Gene's behalf, Rubye in turn piqued the interest of director Clarence Brown. It was early 1945 when MGM and Clarence Brown first embarked on a nationwide casting search for some fresh talent for The Yearling And now months later, Clarence believed that perhaps the role of Orry Baxter might be suited for Gene. So Rubye contacted Gene the day after the Paramount offer was made and persuaded her to meet with Clarence at MGM that day. Despite the fact that MGM newcomer, Jacqueline White, was actually selected and had filmed some scenes that summer, Clarence was still not convinced that she was the right choice. As a result, Gene was called back three times to test for the role and eagerly awaited to hear from the studio each time. This experience earned her a $250 a week, long-term MGM contract which she signed as herself, Gene Roberts. Ultimately, Gene's youthfulness was the deciding factor that prevented MGM from assigning her this lead role. When production resumed in mid-September 1945, Clarence had chosen 28-year-old Jane Wyman, who was on loan from Warner Brothers, to portray a more mature-looking character with co-star Gregory Peck. The Yearling was released in May 1947 and went on to win multiple Academy Awards and nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Jane Wyman.Gene remained under contract with MGM for nearly two years and found that there were very few roles for young women her age at that time. It wasn't until late October 1946 and over a year since Gene first signed on, that she was cast in a small supporting role. This role placed Gene into the last of Ann Sothern's film series, the final episode entitled Undercover Maisie which was released in May 1947. Next, she was cast in the low-budget Comet Productions film Stork Bites Man where she co-starred with Jackie Cooper, who had resumed his acting career after returning from the war. With production completed in early February 1947 and MGM showing no serious interest in her by that spring, Gene asked for and was granted release from her contract. She then signed once more as herself, Gene Roberts, with 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation but was overlooked by the studio there as well. After a year had passed, Gene opted out of the 20th Century contract and was on the move again.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His education was at the Crypt Grammar School from where he went to the Cathedral Grammar School, and later was apprenticed to a Dr Buchanan of Gloucester. His uncle, Daniel Ellis, a member of the Royal Society Edinburgh, suggested that he enrol as a medical student at the newly founded University College London. In his vacations he studied in Paris and attended lectures and worked at anatomy in Berlin.\nEllis was Demonstrator of Anatomy under Professor Richard Quain, and succeeded him in the Chair of Anatomy in 1850, retiring as Emeritus Professor in 1877, but always aloof from the professional world. He was succeeded by Sir George Dancer Thane (1850-1930). Ellis was one of the great names of the world of anatomy in England, having given all his working life to the study and teaching of this discipline, and was held in the highest respect. His lectures were conscientiously precise and lucid, so that his students always paid close attention.\nIn 1840 he published \"Demonstrations of Anatomy: being a Guide to the Knowledge of the Human Body by Dissections\", his name becoming a household word among medical students, and his work becoming the standard textbook in England and the United States. The 11th edition of his book was published in 1890.\nUniversity College London in its first thirty-five years of existence, published an extraordinary number of anatomical atlases. Ellis carried on this tradition by collaborating with the South African natural history illustrator, George Henry Ford, to produce some of the best anatomical artwork ever published. They used the relatively new technique of chromolithography for their imperial folio atlas of fifty-eight plates, \"Illustrations of Dissections in a Series of Original Coloured Plates the Size of Life\". The plates were done between 1863 and 1867, with from four to seven completed each year. These plates are considered exceptionally clear and accurate, with an aesthetic depiction of the cadavers, printed by Mintern Bros., and published by James Walton.During Ellis' tenure the University College London was regarded as the pre-eminent centre for the study of anatomy, its spacious and well-lit dissecting room approved of by both staff and students. The College was fortunate in acquiring and retaining the services of an anatomist of Ellis' stature - his culture, zeal, and energy were legendary - receiving only a moderate salary and with no prospect of career improvement. In Ellis' day cadavers were not treated with any preservatives, so that they were often in an advanced state of putrefaction, limiting dissection to the winter months. Several times he acted as Examiner in Anatomy at the University of London, but declined to join the Court of Examiners of the Royal College of Surgeons.\nOn his retirement Ellis came into a small fortune left him by a relative, built himself a house at Minsterworth, 'Severn Bank', and lived there quietly with his younger sister, devoting himself to gardening and apple-growing. He also ran night classes for the older boys of the parish. A few years before his death he became blind and was tended by his sister.\"Ellis' muscle\", the Corrugator cutis ani muscle, is named after him.", "hasanswer": true}]}

When she was eighteen, she enrolled in the Art Students League of New York where she took classes from John Twachtman and George Bridgman.  She then traveled to Paris in 1902 to continue her studies at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian where she was the first woman to be awarded the Concours Julian-Smith in 1904.On her return to the United States, she began to earn commissions mainly for her meticulous illustrations in magazines and books, like those she drew for Helen Hay Whitney's book of poems, entitled Herbs and Apples (1910). In San Antonio, Texas, she helped form the San Antonio Conversation Society in 1924.  In 1926 she met Diego Rivera. As Rivera was finishing his mural project at the Ministry of Education in Mexico City, Mrs. Van Horn joined him and other artists in the production of the work.  Rivera painted her face in one of the murals on the third floor of the building.For four years (1928\u20131932), she and her husband lived in Berkeley, California where she joined various art leagues and worked with prominent artists in the Bay Area, including John Emmett Gerrity, David Park and Galka Scheyer who represented The Blue Four:  European abstractionists, Feininger, Kandinsky, Jawlensky and Klee. She also became a member of the San Francisco Art Association and the Society of Women Artist, won several notable awards, and was included in a major international retrospective at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco as one of thirty-five American artists.During a trip to Mexico is 1926, Van Horn met and befriended Diego Rivera. He was working on a mural for the Ministry of Education in Mexico city at the time. During her time in Mexico, Van Horn was greatly influenced by Rivera which led to a major transformation in her work. Her subject matter became mostly native peasant women, pictured in an outside setting and much more simplified than her earlier works.She returned to Berkeley in 1941 after her husband died. She contacted an old Berkeley colleague, Marjorie Eaton who lived in Palo Alto on the Juana Briones Ranch, owned by Ms. Eaton's mother. There she spent the last twenty-eight years of her life. \nMrs. Van Horn's life was peripatetic and at times difficult.  Her mother died when she was three, and shortly after moved from her family's sugar plantation on the Mississippi River to New Orleans.  When she fourteen, she went to live in Washington, D.C., with her socially and politically involved aunt and uncle, Martha and Herbert Wadsworth.\nIn Washington she met Douglas MacArthur, who fell in love with her, as evidenced by a recently discovered cache of letters written to her by him. Around the same time she met her husband Robert Osborn Van Horn; they were married in 1908. Van Horn was also a military officer who subsequently served under MacArthur during the First World War and retired as a brigadier general in 1940.\nDuring her married years, Van Horn lived in many places: Cuba, Georgia, Kansas, Texas, and California. She and her husband had two daughters: Margaret born in 1909 and Lucretia in 1916. When Margaret contracted tuberculosis and died in 1932, Van Horn, devastated by the loss, left her family for some time.  It is not clear where she went or for how long.\nVan Horn's artistic evolution went through at least three distinctive phases.

Oberholtzer attended Harvard University and received a bachelor of arts degree, but left after one year of graduate study in landscape architecture.  He made his first trip to the Minnesota-Ontario border lakes in 1906.\nIn 1909 he took his first extended canoe voyage through the border lakes and the Rainy Lake watershed, traveling 3,000 miles that summer.  During the period from 1908 to 1915, Oberholtzer wrote a number of articles and short stories, some under the penname Ernest Carliowa.  Many of the stories and articles were based on his canoe trip experiences.  In 1913, Oberholtzer moved to Rainy Lake.  He purchased Mallard Island in 1922; the tiny island would be his home for more than 50 years.\nAfter plans were announced by business mogul Edward Backus to construct a series of dams to harness the Rainy Lake watershed for power generation, Oberholtzer spoke in opposition at a hearing of the International Joint Commission held at International Falls in September 1925.  As a result of meetings with Minneapolis businessmen who were similarly opposed to industrialization of the area, the Quetico-Superior Council was formed in 1928.  Oberholtzer served as its first president.  His activities for the council included lobbying United States Congress and the Minnesota legislature, testifying before the International Joint Commission and building public support for the council's program.  In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the President's Quetico-Superior Committee to advise and coordinate government activity concerning the Quetico-Superior area. Oberholtzer was its first chairman, and served as a member until 1968.\nOberholtzer was one of the eight founding members of The Wilderness Society and served on its executive council from 1937 until 1967.  His addition to The Wilderness Society lent national stature to the group.  In addition to his wilderness campaigning, he spoke fluent Ojibwe and was a fervent student of their culture.  He never married and died in 1977 after a long period of ill health.\nOberholtzer is recognized today as a leading advocate for the preservation of the Quetico-Superior lake area, as well as an advocate of the Native American culture in that region.

Balfour Gardiner educated?", "ctxs": [{"id": "69_3874", "text": "Henry Balfour Gardiner (7 November 1877 \u2013 28 June 1950) was a British musician, composer, and teacher.He was born at Kensington (London), began to play at the age of 5 and to compose at 9. Between his conventional education at Charterhouse School and New College, Oxford, where he obtained only a pass degree, Gardiner was a piano student at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, where he was taught by Iwan Knorr and Lazzaro Uzielli, who had been a pupil of Clara Schumann. He belonged to the Frankfurt Group, a circle of composers who studied at the Hoch Conservatory in the late 1890s. With George Gardiner (no relation) he collected folk songs in Hampshire (1905\u20131906), taught music briefly at Winchester College (1907), and composed. His works included compositions in a variety of genres, including two symphonies (No 2 premiered at the Proms in 1908), but many of his scores, including the symphonies, are lost and only a very limited amount of his music survives.\nHis best-known work Evening Hymn (1908), a setting of the compline hymn \"Te lucis ante terminum\", is a lush, romantic work for eight-part choir and organ, of dense harmonies. For most of the time, it sits in four parts, though the treble, alto, tenor, and bass parts all subdivide at various points. It is considered a classic of the English choral repertoire and is still regularly performed as an anthem at Evensong in Anglican churches.The fame of this work has overshadowed his surviving orchestral works, which include Overture to a Comedy (1906, revised 1911), the Percy Grainger-like Shepherd Fennell's Dance (1911) (once a favourite at the Proms, chalking up 35 performances between 1911 and 1951), and the Delius-like A Berkshire Idyll, the latter written in 1913 at Field House, Ashampstead Green in Berkshire, where he lived between 1911 and 1930. The first performance of the Idyll (along with two other unpublished pieces, Philomela and the choral setting April), took place on 6 May 1955 at the Royal Festival Hall, 42 years after its completion. It was recorded in 2017 for the first time.Also surviving are a number of short piano works and songs. There is also the one movement String Quartet in Bb major, composed in 1905 and premiered that year on 28 February by the Cathie String Quartet at the Aeolian Hall. It has been recorded by the Tippett Quartet.Gardiner's most important work, possibly, was his promotion of the music of contemporary British and colonial composers, particularly through a series of concerts he personally financed at Queen's Hall London in 1912 to 1913. The composers represented included Arnold Bax, Frederic Austin, Gustav Holst, Percy Grainger, Roger Quilter, Cyril Scott and Norman O'Neill. (The last four had also studied with him at Frankfurt.) Gardiner was very generous with his personal fortune, paying for a private benefit performance of The Planets for Holst in 1918 and purchasing Frederick Delius's house at Grez-sur-Loing to enable him to continue living in it at the end of his life. In the early 1920s he also became a patron of Charles Kennedy Scott, conductor and founder of the Philharmonic Choir which was the predecessor of the present London Philharmonic Choir.Gardiner gave up composing in 1925 largely because he was intensely self-critical: much of his lost music was probably destroyed by him. Thereafter, he devoted himself to a pioneering afforestation programme on his Dorset pig farm. He died in hospital in Salisbury after suffering a stroke.He was the great-uncle of the conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He states that he often \"pay(s) less attention to narrative flow and storyline and put(s) more emphasis on sight, sound and spectacle\" to create a movie that is \"like a live punk/hardcore show.\" The works themselves are often absurdist comedies that feature actress, co-writer, stylist, and wife, Amy Davis.

Rosenthal and co-produced by Andrea Sperling, was shot by Todd Verow in 16mm.\nIt featured a dream sequence set in garden of meat, which was filmed in Rosenthal's garage with 800 pounds of raw, rotting beef. After wrapping, and in the middle of post-production in 1993, Moritsugu received word that he had received a grant from ITVS to create a PBS television show. He says: \"I completed (the script) in 42 hours... and it got the green light. So right after shooting Mod Fuck Explosion, I got $360,000 to shoot Terminal USA.Terminal USA, filmed in Panavision 16mm, was a vicious sitcom parody laying to waste the studious image of the \"model minority\". The director himself played twins - a drug-dealing son and a repressed and closeted math nerd - in a radically dysfunctional Asian American family. The movie was an extreme challenge for Moritsugu, who again worked with producer Andrea Sperling and director of photography Todd Verow. In addition to complications with insurance, payroll, salaries and a large unionized cast and crew, the production itself was fraught with problems including a major outbreak of scabies on the set. Executive produced by James Schamus (former CEO of Focus Features), Moritsugu stated: \"I sort of blew it. I was young, full of myself, no one could help me. I basically spit in his face\". When Terminal USA was completed, it caused a firestorm of controversy with the conservative right because it had been funded with taxpayer money. It screened at the Toronto and Rotterdam Film Festivals and was broadcast on television in over 200 cities across America.After a European promotional tour and American appearances to support Terminal USA, Moritsugu resumed post-production work on Mod Fuck Explosion. \"A defiantly rough-hewn return to barely-aboveground roots despite some overlaps with Terminal USA,\" it was completed in 1994 and won \"Best Feature\" Award at the New York Underground Film Festival. It played the film fest circuit and received tremendous attention, with Moritsugu saying, \"Mod Fuck blew-up in Germany, Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries\u2014they really responded to the angst, death, and Amy as a hot blonde walking on raw meat.\" In America, the movie opened in a number of cities including a 13-week engagement in Los Angeles at the Laemmle Sunset 5 and sold-out runs in Seattle and Baltimore. Giant Robot said about the movie: \"Jon Moritsugu hit some weird epiphany during the making of this film, which was his first mass-watchable work. Jon's wife Amy Davis plays a performance art girl who's caught in a rumble between a small group of mods and a Japanese motorcycle gang. [...] The performances are weird, intentionally screwed up, and dumb, but that's part of the film's brilliance. If you're a fan of strange flicks, you'll start remembering the lines and using them. [...] Awesome soundtrack by Unrest and Karyo Tengoku\". The movie was picked by the readers of Wired as one of the \"Wildest Exploitation Movies,\" sharing the honor with Eraserhead, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead and Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!.Moritsugu's next feature was 1997's Fame Whore, which reprised sitcom mockery and absurdism in service of three parallel stories critiquing fame and featuring Amy Davis as a stoner, trust-fund brat. Produced again by Andrea Sperling, the 16mm movie was a recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation Award. It received \"Best Feature\" and \"Festival Choice\" honors at the New York Underground Film Festival and the Los Angeles Times said of it, \"Fame Whore is crude, edgy and energetic, and its stars throw themselves into their roles with welcome gusto.\" The movie opened theatrically throughout the US and Europe, screening at Lincoln Center in NYC and running for 5 weeks in Los Angeles.Fame Whore was considered for an Academy Award in 1999, but it was rejected on a technicality because it had opened in Los Angeles in 16 mm, and at the time, all Academy Award considerations had to be shown in 35 mm.\nIn late 1999 Moritsugu started work on his next feature, Scumrock, produced once again by Andrea Sperling. He stated: \"The original plan was for Scumrock to be a $2 million, 35mm picture. I thought it was totally do-able, what with the success of Fame Whore. This budget proved to be elusive so we cut it down to $50,000. And alas, we ended up shooting Scumrock for $5,000 using a $150 camcorder.\" Starring Amy Davis (who also was co-writer and director of photography), James Duval (\"Frank the Bunny\" from Donnie Darko), and Kyp Malone (who would later join the band TV on the Radio), the movie was a deadpan comedy capturing the lives of fringe-art rebels dealing with the perils of turning 30 with little to show for their avant-gardness. After receiving a post-production grant from Creative Capital, the movie's footage was decimated and completely degenerated, Moritsugu's intent being to drag it into the gutter and destroy any sheen or aura of a \"pristine digital look\". Scumrock was edited on a VHS cuts-only system and upon completion in 2002, it won the \"Best Feature\" Award at the Chicago Underground Film Festival, following that up with a \"Best Feature\" Award at the 2003 New York Underground Film Festival. It was selected by The Village Voice Film Critics Poll as \"Best of 2003\" and then opened theatrically in the US and Canada in 2004, receiving rave reviews from the Los Angeles Times, LA Weekly and E!.After Scumrock, Moritsugu took a break from \"cinema\", focusing on musical and other creative outlets and moving with Davis to Honolulu, Seattle, and finally Santa Fe.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_3888", "text": "Moritsugu started filmmaking in high school in the early 1980s and then attended Brown University, where he studied semiotics and critical theory.

Rosenthal and co-produced by Andrea Sperling, was shot by Todd Verow in 16mm.\nIt featured a dream sequence set in garden of meat, which was filmed in Rosenthal's garage with 800 pounds of raw, rotting beef. After wrapping, and in the middle of post-production in 1993, Moritsugu received word that he had received a grant from ITVS to create a PBS television show. He says: \"I completed (the script) in 42 hours... and it got the green light. So right after shooting Mod Fuck Explosion, I got $360,000 to shoot Terminal USA.Terminal USA, filmed in Panavision 16mm, was a vicious sitcom parody laying to waste the studious image of the \"model minority\". The director himself played twins - a drug-dealing son and a repressed and closeted math nerd - in a radically dysfunctional Asian American family. The movie was an extreme challenge for Moritsugu, who again worked with producer Andrea Sperling and director of photography Todd Verow. In addition to complications with insurance, payroll, salaries and a large unionized cast and crew, the production itself was fraught with problems including a major outbreak of scabies on the set. Executive produced by James Schamus (former CEO of Focus Features), Moritsugu stated: \"I sort of blew it. I was young, full of myself, no one could help me. I basically spit in his face\". When Terminal USA was completed, it caused a firestorm of controversy with the conservative right because it had been funded with taxpayer money. It screened at the Toronto and Rotterdam Film Festivals and was broadcast on television in over 200 cities across America.After a European promotional tour and American appearances to support Terminal USA, Moritsugu resumed post-production work on Mod Fuck Explosion. \"A defiantly rough-hewn return to barely-aboveground roots despite some overlaps with Terminal USA,\" it was completed in 1994 and won \"Best Feature\" Award at the New York Underground Film Festival. It played the film fest circuit and received tremendous attention, with Moritsugu saying, \"Mod Fuck blew-up in Germany, Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries\u2014they really responded to the angst, death, and Amy as a hot blonde walking on raw meat.\" In America, the movie opened in a number of cities including a 13-week engagement in Los Angeles at the Laemmle Sunset 5 and sold-out runs in Seattle and Baltimore. Giant Robot said about the movie: \"Jon Moritsugu hit some weird epiphany during the making of this film, which was his first mass-watchable work. Jon's wife Amy Davis plays a performance art girl who's caught in a rumble between a small group of mods and a Japanese motorcycle gang. [...] The performances are weird, intentionally screwed up, and dumb, but that's part of the film's brilliance. If you're a fan of strange flicks, you'll start remembering the lines and using them. [...] Awesome soundtrack by Unrest and Karyo Tengoku\". The movie was picked by the readers of Wired as one of the \"Wildest Exploitation Movies,\" sharing the honor with Eraserhead, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead and Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!.Moritsugu's next feature was 1997's Fame Whore, which reprised sitcom mockery and absurdism in service of three parallel stories critiquing fame and featuring Amy Davis as a stoner, trust-fund brat. Produced again by Andrea Sperling, the 16mm movie was a recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation Award. It received \"Best Feature\" and \"Festival Choice\" honors at the New York Underground Film Festival and the Los Angeles Times said of it, \"Fame Whore is crude, edgy and energetic, and its stars throw themselves into their roles with welcome gusto.\" The movie opened theatrically throughout the US and Europe, screening at Lincoln Center in NYC and running for 5 weeks in Los Angeles.Fame Whore was considered for an Academy Award in 1999, but it was rejected on a technicality because it had opened in Los Angeles in 16 mm, and at the time, all Academy Award considerations had to be shown in 35 mm.\nIn late 1999 Moritsugu started work on his next feature, Scumrock, produced once again by Andrea Sperling. He stated: \"The original plan was for Scumrock to be a $2 million, 35mm picture. I thought it was totally do-able, what with the success of Fame Whore. This budget proved to be elusive so we cut it down to $50,000. And alas, we ended up shooting Scumrock for $5,000 using a $150 camcorder.\" Starring Amy Davis (who also was co-writer and director of photography), James Duval (\"Frank the Bunny\" from Donnie Darko), and Kyp Malone (who would later join the band TV on the Radio), the movie was a deadpan comedy capturing the lives of fringe-art rebels dealing with the perils of turning 30 with little to show for their avant-gardness. After receiving a post-production grant from Creative Capital, the movie's footage was decimated and completely degenerated, Moritsugu's intent being to drag it into the gutter and destroy any sheen or aura of a \"pristine digital look\". Scumrock was edited on a VHS cuts-only system and upon completion in 2002, it won the \"Best Feature\" Award at the Chicago Underground Film Festival, following that up with a \"Best Feature\" Award at the 2003 New York Underground Film Festival. It was selected by The Village Voice Film Critics Poll as \"Best of 2003\" and then opened theatrically in the US and Canada in 2004, receiving rave reviews from the Los Angeles Times, LA Weekly and E!.After Scumrock, Moritsugu took a break from \"cinema\", focusing on musical and other creative outlets and moving with Davis to Honolulu, Seattle, and finally Santa Fe.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was born in Velyka Znamianka, Ukraine in a poor Jewish family as the 9th child. He completed secondary education in Kherson, Ukraine; then studied for a year in Rostov, Russia and moved to Saint Petersburg seeking university degree. There he studied in several technical universities. Engineering however did not attract Shatunovsky and he dedicated himself to mathematics, voluntarily attending lectures by Chebyshev. Shatunovsky could not complete any university program due to lack of funds. He later attempted to obtain a university degree in Switzerland, but failed for the same reason. After returning from Switzerland, he lived in small Russian towns, earning by private lessons. In the meantime, he wrote his first mathematical papers and sent some of them to Odesa University. Their quality was acknowledged; Shatunovsky was admitted to the university, received financial support, obtained a degree and was appointed as staff member in 1905. In 1917, he became a professor and continued working at the Odesa University through the rest of his life.Shatunovsky focused on several topics in mathematical analysis and algebra, such as group theory, number theory and geometry. Independently from Hilbert, he developed a similar axiomatic theory and applied it in geometry, algebra, Galois theory and analysis. However, most of his activity was devoted to teaching at Odesa University and writing associated books and study materials.Shatunovsky died in 1929 from stomach cancer two days after his 70th birthday. Despite severe pain associated with his illness, he kept his usual sense of humor and continued to lecture almost until the day he died. He was remembered by his students and colleagues for his original approach to mathematical problems and ability to popularize the most complex mathematical ideas.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

In 1926, in Clearwater, Florida, when Berryman was 11 years old, his father shot and killed himself. Smith was jobless at the time, and he and Martha were filing for divorce. Berryman was haunted by his father's death for the rest of his life and wrote about his struggle to come to terms with it in much of his poetry.\nIn \"Dream Song #143\", he wrote, \"That mad drive [to commit suicide] wiped out my childhood.

Although his stepfather later divorced his mother, Berryman and his stepfather stayed on good terms. With both his mother and stepfather working, his mother decided to send him to the South Kent School, a private boarding school in Connecticut. Berryman then attended Columbia College, where he was president of the Philolexian Society, joined the Boar's Head Society, edited The Columbia Review, and studied under the literary scholar and poet Mark Van Doren. Berryman later credited Van Doren with sparking his interest in writing poetry seriously. For two years, Berryman also studied overseas at Clare College, Cambridge, on a Kellett Fellowship from Columbia.

One of the other young poets included in the book was Randall Jarrell.\nBerryman published some of this early verse in his first book, Poems, in 1942. His first mature collection of poems, The Dispossessed, appeared six years later, published by William Sloane Associates. The book received largely negative reviews from poets like Jarrell, who wrote, in The Nation, that Berryman was \"a complicated, nervous, and intelligent [poet]\" whose work was too derivative of W. B. Yeats. Berryman later concurred with this assessment of his early work, saying, \"I didn't want to be like Yeats; I wanted to be Yeats.\"In October 1942, Berryman married Eileen Mulligan (later Simpson) in a ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral, with Van Doren as his best man. The couple moved to Beacon Hill, and Berryman lectured at Harvard. The marriage ended in 1953 (the divorce was formalized in 1956), when Simpson finally grew weary of Berryman's affairs and acting as \"net-holder\" during his self-destructive personal crises. Simpson memorialized her time with Berryman and his circle in her 1982 book Poets in Their Youth.In 1947, Berryman started an affair with a married woman named Chris Haynes, documented in a long sonnet sequence that he refrained from publishing in part because that would have revealed the affair to his wife. He eventually published the work, Berryman's Sonnets, in 1967. It includes over one hundred sonnets.In 1950, Berryman published a biography of the fiction writer and poet Stephen Crane, whom he greatly admired. The book was followed by his next significant poem, Homage to Mistress Bradstreet (1956), which featured illustrations by the artist Ben Shahn and was Berryman's first poem to receive \"national attention\" and a positive response from critics. Edmund Wilson wrote that it was \"the most distinguished long poem by an American since T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land.\" When Homage to Mistress Bradstreet and Other Poems was published in 1959, the poet Conrad Aiken praised the book's shorter poems, which he found superior to \"Homage to Mistress Bradstreet\".Despite his third book of verse's relative success, Berryman's great poetic breakthrough occurred with 77 Dream Songs (1964). It won the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for poetry and solidified Berryman's standing as one of the most important poets of the post-World War II generation that included Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, and Delmore Schwartz. Soon thereafter, the press began to give Berryman a great deal of attention, as did arts organizations and even the White House, which sent him an invitation to dine with President Lyndon B. Johnson (though Berryman declined because he was in Ireland at the time). Berryman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1967, and that same year Life magazine ran a feature story on him.

He is an ordained Church of England minister and holds a doctorate in neuroscience. He has written several Christian books and is a regular speaker at Word Alive and other conferences.As an 18-year-old Sach was an atheist and viewed Christians as \"naive, superstitious and ignorant\". Whilst reading Natural Sciences as an undergraduate at St John's College, University of Cambridge, Sach was contacted by the Christian Union who challenged him to think about whether or not the resurrection of Jesus Christ was a historical fact or not. He eventually concluded that it was, and became a Christian. After his degree, Sach worked as an apprentice for a year at the church of St Andrew the Great, Cambridge.\nSach then did a doctorate in neuroscience at the University of York. He published three scientific papers on auditory spatial attention.He then worked for St Helen's Bishopsgate in London for three years. Whilst there he studied part-time at the Cornhill Training Course. From there went to Oak Hill Theological College (with a six-month exchange to Moore Theological College, Sydney) to train for ordination in the Church of England. He then worked as a curate at St Helens for several years, leading the 6pm and then the 10:30am congregations.Sach is currently a minister at Grace Church Greenwich and a tutor on the Cornhill Training Course.Sach has co-authored a number of books on biblical exegesis in the \"Dig Deeper\" series. He authored a booklet titled \"Has Science Disproved God?\"  published by UCCF, which aimed to \"explain why I think it is reasonable to believe in God in the face of science\".Sach opposes Neo-Darwinian evolution viewing it at variance with the first books of the Bible. Sach, however, challenges the notion that the Hebrew word \"Yom\" (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd) in the creation account, according to Genesis, refers to a literal day (24 hours), therefore denying that creation occurred in a period of six days (6 x 24 hours). Rather, Sach proposes that the Genesis creation account is a poetic way of speaking about the careful ordered way in which God made the universe.In 2014, at the Christian youth festival Newday, Sach was questioned by the scholar Thomas Alberto on his knowledge of the Hebrew language regarding the first book of the Bible, Genesis.

{"id": "69_541", "question": "Where was John Sutherland educated?", "ctxs": [{"id": "69_4120", "text": "John Sutherland (December 1808 \u2013 14 July 1891) was a physician and promoter of sanitary science.\nSutherland was born in Edinburgh, where he completed his high school studies. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1827, and graduated M.D. at the university in 1831.\nHe was married to Sarah Elizabeth Cowie (1808\u201395), daughter of a Lancashire merchant. There were no children. Mrs Sutherland became a friend of Florence Nightingale, and assisted her with practical matters, when he became Nightingale's closest collaborator. Mrs Sutherland shared their concerns about public health; she was an active member of the Ladies' Sanitary Association.\nAfter spending much time on the continent he practised for a short period in Liverpool, where he edited 'The Liverpool Health of Towns' Advocate' in 1846. In 1848, at the request of the Earl of Carlisle, he entered the public service as an inspector under the first board of health. He conducted several special inquiries, notably one into the cholera epidemic of 1848\u20139 (Parl. Papers, 1850 No. 1273, 1852 No. 1523). He was the head of a commission sent to foreign countries to inquire into the law and practice of burial. In 1851, Sutherland was appointed as the British medical delegate to the first International Sanitary Conference (aka Cholera Conference or Quarantine Conference). Louis Napoleon conferred him the Order of the Legion of Honour for services in producing a new International Sanitary Regulation.\nIn 1855 he was engaged at the Home Office in bringing into operation the act for abolishing intramural interments (ib. 1856, No. 146). He was also doing duty in the reorganised general board of health when, at the request of Lord Palmerston and Lord Panmure, he became the head of the Sanitary Commission sent to the Crimean War to deal with the massive sanitary defects of the war hospitals. This commission's mandate was not only to investigate but to implement changes. It started work in March 1855 on the worst Scutari hospitals and succeeded in bringing down the death rates. With Sutherland was a leading civil engineer, Robert Rawlinson, and members of the pioneering Sanitary Department at Liverpool, who did the cleaning out of the sewers and drains.  \nOn 25 August 1855 he came to England for consultation, and was summoned to Balmoral to inform the Queen of the steps that had been taken for the benefit of the troops.\nAfter the war he and Nightingale, with many others, tried to get the planned Royal Victoria Hospital at Netley cancelled (it was drastically redesigned). He and Nightingale jointly produced a confidential report on it for the war secretary.He took an active part in the preparation of the report of the royal commission on the health of the army dated 1858 (ib. 1857\u201358, No. 2318), and also of the report on the state of the army in India, dated 19 May 1863 (ib. 1863, No. 3184). Both reports were of vast importance to the welfare of the soldiers, and most of Sutherland's recommendations were carried out. One of these was the appointment of the barrack and hospital improvement commission, with Sidney Herbert as president and Captain (afterwards Sir) Douglas Galton, Dr. Burrell of the army medical department, and Sutherland as members. This committee visited every barrack and hospital in the United Kingdom, and the sanitary arrangements of each were reported on. Defects were brought to light and remedied, and the health of the troops consequently improved (ib. 1861, No. 2839). Subsequently, Dr. Sutherland and Captain Galton visited and made reports on the Mediterranean stations, including the Ionian Islands (ib. 1863, No. 3207).\nAs a member of the Royal Commission on the Crimean War, Sutherland worked up the considerable amount of evidence for it. He also gave his own evidence to it. He then became the \"active member\" of the four sub-commissions set up within the War Office, after the Crimean War, to ensure that the recommendations of the Royal Commission were implemented. Further, again according to Nightingale, not only was he a member of the Royal Commission on India, he \"wrote nearly the whole\" of the report on it. That work benefited as well as the British Army, \"the whole native population\u2014all that has been done for them sprang from this commission\".In 1862 the barrack and hospital improvement commission was reconstituted with the quartermaster-general as president and Sutherland as a prominent member. The title was altered to the army sanitary committee in 1865 (ib. 1865, No. 424). Two Indian officers were added, and all sanitary reports were submitted to the committee and suggestions for improving Indian stations prepared. This arrangement remained in force until Sutherland's retirement on 30 June 1888, when he was appointed a medical superintending inspector-general of the board of health and home office.\nNightingale considered that Dr Sutherland received so little recognition for his work: no honours from the UK, although the French gave him the Legion of Honour.\nNightingale and Sutherland formed an effective public health reform team. They shared a common philosophy, of the application of the best available science, to be applied to the problem at hand, then ongoing monitoring to ensure that the results were beneficial. Sutherland acted sometimes as Nightingale\u2019s research assistant, finding crucial material for her\u2014he was a doctor and well connected internationally with public health and military experts. Sometimes he was her secretary, reading correspondence and drafting replies for her. They shared a Christian faith and ambitious, faith-based, goals for reform. Sutherland drafted some of Nightingale\u2019s boldest statements about quality hospital care being available to the poorest\u2014as good as that received by private patients.\nSutherland continued his beneficent work to within a few years of his death, which took place at Oakleigh, Alleyne Park, Norwood, Surrey, on 14 July 1891. Sutherland\u2019s last words to his wife were for Nightingale: \u201cGive her my love and my blessing\u201d. Nightingale insisted that a full obituary to her friend and collaborator appeared in The Times. Sutherland was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.Eight volumes of notes and correspondence between Sutherland and Nightingale are at the British Library.", "hasanswer": true}]}

To avoid persecution in the largely non-Jewish K\u00f6slin, his family placed him in the Jewish Orphanage Berlin-Pankow in Berlin in 1936. In 1938, at age 13, to escape the rising anti-Semitism of the Sturmabteilung (Storm Troopers) and teachers, Brent was sent to England on the first of the Kindertransports and became a pupil at Anna Essinger's Bunce Court School. His parents and older sister stayed behind in Germany. Because his status as a German national would have made him liable to execution in the event of capture, he was advised to change his name. After the war, he found out that his parents were sent to Riga, Latvia, and executed. There are three stolpersteine for his parents and sister in Berlin.

While on summer vacation in Avalon (New Jersey), after attending Swarthmore College for a year, she met and eloped with Richard J. Westcott in 1931, the couple then residing in Camden (New Jersey) where Jan Westcott became a \"stay at home mom\" to the couple's two sons. Her longstanding interest in history, passed down from her father, was reinforced by the outbreak of World War II. After her husband left to join the army in 1943, Westcott tried her hand at writing a historical novel, which she worked on while her sons were at school and after putting them to bed. The resultant novel, The Border Lord, was published in 1946.Divorcing her first husband in 1947, Westcott in 1954 married Robert Phelps Barden, the chief radiologist of Chestnut Hill Hospital (Philadelphia). The couple, who had met while both were summering in Avalon, subsequently resided for many years in Philadelphia's Chestnut Hill neighborhood. Westcott, whose fifth novel: The Walsingham Woman, had been published in 1953, had a lower-volume writing career during her second marriage with her eleventh and final novel: A Woman of Quality, being published in 1978, thirty-two years after Westcott's inaugural novel and thirty-three years before the author's passing at age 99.\n\nWhile promoting her 1969 novel The White Rose \u2013 the result of three years' work \u2013 Westcott asserted having done thorough research for her novels via the UPenn library.

In 2012, Cruz was elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first Hispanic-American to serve as a U.S. senator from Texas. In the Senate, he has taken consistently conservative positions on economic and social policy; he played a leading role in the 2013 United States federal government shutdown, seeking to force Congress and President Barack Obama to defund the Affordable Care Act. He was reelected in a close Senate race in 2018 against Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke.\nOn March 23, 2015, Cruz announced he was running for president. Despite having only been a senator for two years, he emerged as a serious contender in the Republican primaries. The competition for the Republican presidential nomination between Cruz and front-runner Donald Trump was heated and characterized by a series of public personal attacks. After Trump won the nomination, Cruz initially declined to endorse him, but he became a staunch supporter of Trump during his presidency. After the January 2021 Capitol attack, Cruz received widespread political and popular backlash for objecting to the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election and giving credence to the false claim that the election was fraudulent.Cruz is running for reelection to the Senate in 2024 against Democratic nominee Colin Allred and other third-party candidates.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "69_4296", "text": "Rafael Edward Cruz was born on December 22, 1970, at Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to Eleanor Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Darragh) Wilson and Rafael Cruz.

As a school boy, he conducted water analysis with the Leeds City Analyst. He was taught chemistry by Julius B. Cohen at the University of Leeds, and then he worked with Albrecht Kossel on arginase at the University of Heidelberg. He joined Columbia University in 1905, working in the lab of Christian Herter. During his work on amino acids he obtained his PhD from Leeds. In 1905, he was one of the first scientists to successfully synthesise adrenaline in the laboratory (see: History of catecholamine research).\nIn 1914 he went back to England to offer his service with the war effort. Due to a request for a chemist by Alexis Carrel to the Rockefeller Institute, Dakin joined Carrel in 1916 at a temporary hospital in Compi\u00e8gne. There they developed the Carrel\u2013Dakin method of wound treatments. This consisted of intermittently irrigating the wound with Dakin's solution, a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite (the active ingredient in common liquid bleach products) and boric acid.  In the process, he analyzed more than 200 candidate substances, and developed quantitative methods to evaluate their effectiveness for disinfection and wound healing. The solution is still widely used for that purpose, as of 2013. The World War I era Rockefeller War Demonstration Hospital (United States Army Auxiliary Hospital No. 1) was created, in part, to promote the Carrel\u2013Dakin method:\n\"The war demonstration hospital of the Rockefeller Institute was planned as a school in which to teach military surgeons the principles of and art of applying the Carrel-Dakin treatment.\"\nAfter he married the widow of Christian Herter in 1916, he worked in his private laboratory in Scarsdale, New York and had several close collaborations with other scientists. His main working fields were amino acids and enzymes. The extraction of amino acids from hydrolyzed peptides by butanol was invented by him. He also was interested in organic chemistry and synthesis, and devised the Dakin reaction and the Dakin\u2013West reaction.\nHe died shortly after the death of his wife in early 1952.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He believed vegetables and starchy foods produced poisonous substances in the digestive system which were responsible for heart disease, tumors, mental illness and tuberculosis. He believed that human dentition demonstrated that humans were meant to eat meat, and sought to limit vegetables, fruit, starches, and fats to one-third of the diet.The Salisbury steak, his means of achieving this goal, is ground beef flavored with onion and seasoning and then broiled and covered with gravy or brown sauce. It was introduced in 1888. Salisbury saw beef as an excellent defense against many different physical problems. He suggested that Salisbury steak should be eaten three times a day, with much hot water to cleanse the digestive system. He was an early American proponent of a low-carbohydrate diet for weight loss, and he promoted his diet for that purpose. His diet became known as the \"Salisbury diet\".

He posited that certain dietary choices could impact well-being. He believed vegetables and starchy foods produced poisonous substances in the digestive system which were responsible for heart disease, tumors, mental illness and tuberculosis. He believed that human dentition demonstrated that humans were meant to eat meat, and sought to limit vegetables, fruit, starches, and fats to one-third of the diet.The Salisbury steak, his means of achieving this goal, is ground beef flavored with onion and seasoning and then broiled and covered with gravy or brown sauce. It was introduced in 1888. Salisbury saw beef as an excellent defense against many different physical problems. He suggested that Salisbury steak should be eaten three times a day, with much hot water to cleanse the digestive system. He was an early American proponent of a low-carbohydrate diet for weight loss, and he promoted his diet for that purpose. His diet became known as the \"Salisbury diet\". It has been described as an early example of a fad diet. The Salisbury diet was promoted by Elma Stuart in her book What Must I do to Get Well?, that went through at least 32 editions.Salisbury steak is similar to a number of other dishes made of ground beef. Its name caught on partly because World War I inspired a movement in English-speaking nations to avoid German-sounding terms such as \"hamburger\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

They lived on Sherrif Brae. His early education was spent at Leith Grammar School, after which he became the apprentice of the Leith surgeon John Cheyne (father of John Cheyne), with the aim of going to sea.

His father's brother Robert Jameson, was also a physician and lived with them on Rotten Row.By 1793, influenced by the Regius Professor of Natural History, John Walker (1731\u20131803), Jameson abandoned medicine and the idea of being a ship's surgeon, and focused instead on science, particularly geology and mineralogy. It is worth noting that Walker was a presbyterian Minister who had actually combined the Regius Professorship with a period of service as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1790.\nIn 1793, Jameson was given the responsibility of looking after the University's Natural History Collection.

After stages in Moscow (1992 \u2013 1996) and Brussels (1996 \u2013 1998), she has been making her home in Cologne and is working as a freelance writer.\nIn her novel Emmas Gl\u00fcck (Emma\u2019s Bliss) of 2003, translated into nine languages, she included motifs from her hometown in northern Hesse. It has been her most successful work so far. With its crisp and witty sentences, its deadpan presentation of the improbable and eccentric and its deep sympathy for its cast of misfits, Schreiber's style in this book somewhat recalls that of Heinrich B\u00f6ll.

Innes was bishop for over seven years, and died at Elgin on 2 August 1414. Innes has been traditionally credited with supervising much of the rebuilding to Elgin Cathedral.

Gompert (1875 -1946) was the Architect and Superintendent of School Buildings for the New York City Board of Education. According to research [1] published by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Gompert was educated at Adelphi Academy,\nPratt Institute, and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. The Landmarks Commission report on Gompert was included in its study of its decision to grant landmark status to the building that once housed The High School of Music & Art. It states:\n\"After employment in the firms of McKim, Mead & White, Maynicke & Franke, and George Edward Harding & Gooch, he established his own practice around 1906 and specialized in the design of commercial and institutional buildings. He was elected president of the Brooklyn chapter of the\nAmerican Institute of Architects in 1923. Gompert was hired in February 1923 by the New York City Board of Education as an expert to assist in the reorganization of the Bureau of Construction and Maintenance and to facilitate the construction of public schools; his initial six-month contract gave him the 'powers and duties of Superintendent of School Buildings.'\n\"According to The New York Times, Gompert had 'much experience in the directing of large building construction enterprises.' After a six-month extension of his contract, Gompert was appointed in January 1924 to the position of Architect and Superintendent of School Buildings for the Board of Education, and became the third-highest paid official in the administration of Mayor John Francis Hylan.\n\"Gompert was the first successor to the noted Charles B.J. Snyder, Superintendent of School Buildings from 1891 until January 1, 1923, who had been responsible for the vast school construction program following the consolidation of New York City in 1898, and had been 'virtually forced out of the post under pressure by. . . Mayor Hylan.'\n\"To alleviate the serious overcrowding in the schools caused by immigration after World War I,\nNew York City undertook another extensive program of school construction in the mid-1920s. Gompert was forced to contend with a significant shortage of bricklayers in the citywide building industry, as well as a lack of interest on the part of major construction firms in bidding on public\nschool construction projects. He attempted to bring about economy and change in the process of school construction, including standardizing design and construction, employing general contracts instead of individual construction contracts, and instituting double shifts to shorten construction time. In 1925, however, charges began to surface, first by a mayoral candidate, that many of the schools constructed under Gompert were defective. By the end of 1927, three separate investigations were underway and Gompert resigned in December. Former Mayor Hylan responded to critics that\nGompert was under attack because he had 'built too many schools to suit those that do not want the\nchildren educated.'\n\"The Board of Education's Joint Committee of Architects and Engineers issued\nits report in 1928 and called Gompert's schools 'in general honest, safe, efficient and appropriate to the purpose.'\n\"In his nearly five years as school architect,Gompert was credited with overseeing the design\nand construction of some 170 new schools and\nadditions, including The High School of Music & Art (in 1924), DeWitt Clinton High School and Theodore Roosevelt High School (1929), the Bronx; James Madison High School (1926), Brooklyn; and\nJamaica High School (1927) and Far Rockaway High School (1929), Queens, in austere versions of\nsuch contemporary institutional styles as Collegiate Gothic, Georgian, and Spanish Colonial.

He was educated at Repton School, before matriculating to Trinity College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, Fry played first-class cricket for Oxford University Cricket Club, making his debut for the club against Yorkshire at Oxford in 1959. He scored 576 runs at an average of 26.18 in debut season, including a maiden century against the Free Foresters, sharing an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 256 with Abbas Ali Baig which remained a first-class record for the fifth wicket for Oxford until 2017, when it was broken by Dan Escott's and Matthew Naylor's partnership of 267. He gained his blue in this season, when he played against Cambridge University in The University Match at Lord's. The Oxford side of 1959 was considered the last great Oxford University side, with E. W. Swanton proffering that it was good enough to finish in the top half of the County Championship.The following season, Fry made fifteen first-class appearances for Oxford in 1960 and made his second appearance in The University Match, which gained him his second blue. In his season, he scored 642 runs for Oxford and made his second century. Later in the season, he made five first-class appearances for Hampshire in the County Championship, scoring 134 runs with a highest score of 38. Against Sussex at Bournemouth, he was notably bowled by Robin Marlar, who would later become one of his successors to the presidency of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He followed in the footsteps of both his father and grandfather, C. B. Fry in playing for Hampshire. As of 2024, this remains the only instance of three generations of one family playing for the county. Fry did not, however, feature for Hampshire in their County Championship winning campaign the following season.\nFry played his third and final season for Oxford University in 1961, making twelve appearances and scoring 358 runs at an average of 18.84; his highest score in this season was 61. In his final year, he made his third appearance in The University Match and thus, gained his third blue. 41 of his 50 first-class appearances came for Oxford, with him scoring 1,576 runs for the university at an average of 24.24. The following season, having graduated from Oxford, he appeared twice for Northamptonshire against Cambridge University at Northampton, and Essex in the County Championship at Colchester. He later appeared twice for the Free Foresters in first-class cricket, against Oxford University in 1964 and 1968. Fry has had a long association with the MCC, succeeding Sir Tim Rice as its president in 2003. His tenure was not without controversy, with critics in the MCC claiming he ran club affairs akin to a dictator. At the end of his twelve-month presidency, he was succeeded by Tom Graveney, who was the first ex-professional to hold the post.

As foreign secretary in the Lloyd George ministry, he issued the Balfour Declaration of 1917 on behalf of the cabinet, which supported a \"home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine.Entering Parliament in 1874, Balfour achieved prominence as Chief Secretary for Ireland, in which position he suppressed agrarian unrest whilst taking measures against absentee landlords. He opposed Irish Home Rule, saying there could be no half-way house between Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom or becoming independent. From 1891 he led the Conservative Party in the House of Commons, serving under his uncle, Lord Salisbury, whose government won large majorities in 1895 and 1900. An esteemed debater, he was bored by the mundane tasks of party management.\nIn July 1902, he succeeded his uncle as prime minister. In domestic policy he passed the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903, which bought out most of the Anglo-Irish land owners. The Education Act 1902 had a major long-term impact in modernising the school system in England and Wales and provided financial support for schools operated by the Church of England and by the Catholic Church. Nonconformists were outraged and mobilised their voters, but were unable to reverse it. In foreign and defence policy, he oversaw reform of British defence policy and supported Jackie Fisher's naval innovations. He secured the Entente Cordiale with France, an alliance that ended centuries of intermittent conflict between the two states and their predecessors. He cautiously embraced imperial preference as championed by Joseph Chamberlain, but resignations from the Cabinet over the abandonment of free trade left his party divided. He also suffered from public anger at the later stages of the Boer War (counter-insurgency warfare characterised as \"methods of barbarism\") and the importation of Chinese labour to South Africa (\"Chinese slavery\"). He resigned as prime minister in December 1905 and the following month the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 election, in which he lost his own seat. He soon re-entered Parliament and continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition throughout the crisis over Lloyd George's 1909 budget, the narrow loss of two further General Elections in 1910, and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911. He resigned as party leader in 1911.\nBalfour returned as First Lord of the Admiralty in Asquith's Coalition Government (1915\u20131916). In December 1916, he became foreign secretary in David Lloyd George's coalition. He was frequently left out of the inner workings of foreign policy, although the Balfour Declaration on a Jewish homeland bore his name. He continued to serve in senior positions throughout the 1920s, and died in 1930, aged 81, having spent a vast inherited fortune. He never married.

His father Simkha Leibovich (also known as Semyon Lvovich) was a banker and his mother was Tsetsilia Moiseevna.Vygotsky was raised in the city of Gomel, where he was homeschooled until 1911 and then obtained a formal degree with distinction in a private Jewish gymnasium, which allowed him entrance to a university. In 1913, Vygotsky was admitted to the Moscow University by mere ballot through a \"Jewish Lottery\": at the time a three percent Jewish student quota was administered for entry in Moscow and Saint Petersburg universities. He had an interest in the humanities and social sciences, but at the insistence of his parents he applied to the medical school at Moscow University. During the first semester of study, he transferred to the law school. In parallel, he attended lectures at Shanyavsky Moscow City People's University. Vygotsky's early interests were in the arts and, primarily, in the topics of the history of the Jewish people, the tradition, culture and Jewish identity.\nIn January 1924, Vygotsky took part in the Second All-Russian Psychoneurological Congress in Petrograd (soon thereafter renamed Leningrad). After the Congress, Vygotsky met with Alexander Luria and with his help received an invitation to become a research fellow at the Psychological Institute in Moscow which was under the direction of Konstantin Kornilov. Vygotsky moved to Moscow with his new wife, Roza Smekhova, whom he would have two children with. He began his career at the Psychological Institute as a \"staff scientist, second class\". He also became a secondary teacher, covering a period marked by his interest in the processes of learning and the role of language in learning.By the end of 1925, Vygotsky completed his dissertation titled \"The Psychology of Art\", which was not published until the 1960s, and a book titled \"Pedagogical Psychology\", which apparently was created on the basis of lecture notes that he prepared in Gomel while he was a psychology instructor at local educational establishments.

His demonstration of the golden rule savings rate, a concept related to work by John von Neumann, started a wave of research on how much a nation should spend on present consumption rather than save and invest for future generations.\nPhelps was at the University of Pennsylvania from 1966 to 1971 and moved to Columbia University in 1971. His most seminal work inserted a microfoundation, one featuring imperfect information, incomplete knowledge and expectations about wages and prices, to support a macroeconomic theory of employment determination and price-wage dynamics. That led to his development of the natural rate of unemployment: its existence and the mechanism governing its size. In the early 2000s, he turned to the study of business innovation.\nHe is the founding director, since 2001, of Columbia's Center on Capitalism and Society.

In 1951, he went to Amherst College for his undergraduate education. At his father's advice, Phelps enrolled in his first economics course in his second year at Amherst. Economist James Nelson gave the course, which was based on the famous textbook Economics by Paul Samuelson. Phelps was strongly impressed with the possibility of applying formal analysis to business. He quickly became aware of an important unsolved problem with the existing economic theory and the existing gap between microeconomics and macroeconomics.\nAfter receiving his B.A. at Amherst in 1955, Phelps went to Yale University for graduate studies. At Yale, he studied under future Nobel laureates James Tobin and Thomas Schelling, among others. Phelps was also strongly influenced by William Fellner whose course emphasized the expectations of agents. Phelps received his Ph.D. in Economics from Yale in 1959.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_4676", "text": "After receiving his Ph.D., Phelps went to work as an economist for the RAND Corporation. However, feeling he could not pursue macroeconomics at RAND (which focused on defense work), Phelps decided to return to the academic world. In 1960, he took a research position at the Cowles Foundation while he was also teaching at Yale. At the Cowles Foundation, his research focused mainly on neoclassical growth theory, following the seminal work of Robert Solow. As part of his research, in 1961 Phelps published a famous paper on the Golden Rule savings rate, one of his major contributions to economic science. He also wrote papers dealing with other areas of economic theory, such as monetary economics or Ricardian equivalence and its relation to optimal growth.\nHis position at Cowles gave Phelps the chance to interact with Arthur Okun and other notables in the field. He was able to collaborate with other top economists working on growth theory, including David Cass and fellow Nobelist Tjalling Koopmans. During the 1962\u201363 academic year, Phelps visited MIT, where he was in contact with future Nobel Prize winners Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow and Franco Modigliani.In 1966, Phelps left Yale and moved to the University of Pennsylvania to take up a tenured position as a professor of economics. At Penn, Phelps's research focused mainly on the link between employment, wage setting and inflation, leading to his influential 1968 paper \"Money-Wage Dynamics and Labor Market Equilibrium\" and others. The research contributed important insights in the microeconomics of the Phillips curve, including the role of expectations (in the form of adaptive expectations) and imperfect information in the setting of wages and prices. It also introduced the concept of the natural rate of unemployment and argued that labor market equilibrium is independent of the rate of inflation and so there is no long-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. That, if accurate, would have the crucial implication that the Keynesian policy of demand management has only transitory effects and so cannot be used to control the long-term rate of unemployment in the economy. In January 1969, Phelps organized a conference at Penn in support of the research on the microfoundations of inflation and employment determination.

In 1951, he went to Amherst College for his undergraduate education. At his father's advice, Phelps enrolled in his first economics course in his second year at Amherst. Economist James Nelson gave the course, which was based on the famous textbook Economics by Paul Samuelson. Phelps was strongly impressed with the possibility of applying formal analysis to business. He quickly became aware of an important unsolved problem with the existing economic theory and the existing gap between microeconomics and macroeconomics.\nAfter receiving his B.A. at Amherst in 1955, Phelps went to Yale University for graduate studies. At Yale, he studied under future Nobel laureates James Tobin and Thomas Schelling, among others. Phelps was also strongly influenced by William Fellner whose course emphasized the expectations of agents.

However, feeling he could not pursue macroeconomics at RAND (which focused on defense work), Phelps decided to return to the academic world. In 1960, he took a research position at the Cowles Foundation while he was also teaching at Yale. At the Cowles Foundation, his research focused mainly on neoclassical growth theory, following the seminal work of Robert Solow. As part of his research, in 1961 Phelps published a famous paper on the Golden Rule savings rate, one of his major contributions to economic science. He also wrote papers dealing with other areas of economic theory, such as monetary economics or Ricardian equivalence and its relation to optimal growth.\nHis position at Cowles gave Phelps the chance to interact with Arthur Okun and other notables in the field. He was able to collaborate with other top economists working on growth theory, including David Cass and fellow Nobelist Tjalling Koopmans. During the 1962\u201363 academic year, Phelps visited MIT, where he was in contact with future Nobel Prize winners Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow and Franco Modigliani.In 1966, Phelps left Yale and moved to the University of Pennsylvania to take up a tenured position as a professor of economics. At Penn, Phelps's research focused mainly on the link between employment, wage setting and inflation, leading to his influential 1968 paper \"Money-Wage Dynamics and Labor Market Equilibrium\" and others. The research contributed important insights in the microeconomics of the Phillips curve, including the role of expectations (in the form of adaptive expectations) and imperfect information in the setting of wages and prices. It also introduced the concept of the natural rate of unemployment and argued that labor market equilibrium is independent of the rate of inflation and so there is no long-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. That, if accurate, would have the crucial implication that the Keynesian policy of demand management has only transitory effects and so cannot be used to control the long-term rate of unemployment in the economy. In January 1969, Phelps organized a conference at Penn in support of the research on the microfoundations of inflation and employment determination. The conference papers were published the next year in a book that had a strong and lasting influence; it became known as the \"Phelps volume\".

He previously served as the eighth United States secretary of state from 1817 to 1825. During his long diplomatic and political career, Adams served as an ambassador and also as a member of the United States Congress representing Massachusetts in both chambers. He was the eldest son of John Adams, who served as the second president of the United States from 1797 to 1801, and First Lady Abigail Adams. Initially a Federalist like his father, he won election to the presidency as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and later, in the mid-1830s, became affiliated with the Whig Party.\nBorn in Braintree, Massachusetts, Adams spent much of his youth in Europe, where his father served as a diplomat. After returning to the United States, Adams established a successful legal practice in Boston. In 1794, President George Washington appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands, and Adams would serve in high-ranking diplomatic posts until 1801, when Thomas Jefferson took office as president. Federalist leaders in Massachusetts arranged for Adams's election to the United States Senate in 1802, but Adams broke with the Federalist Party over foreign policy and was denied re-election. In 1809, President James Madison, a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to Russia. Multilingual, Adams held diplomatic posts for the duration of Madison's presidency, and he served as part of the American delegation that negotiated an end to the War of 1812. In 1817, President James Monroe selected Adams as his secretary of state. In that role, Adams negotiated the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, which provided for the American acquisition of Florida. He also helped formulate the Monroe Doctrine, which became a key tenet of U.S. foreign policy. In 1818, Adams was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.Adams, Andrew Jackson, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay\u2014all members of the Democratic-Republican Party\u2014competed in the 1824 presidential election. Because no candidate won a majority of electoral votes, the House of Representatives held a contingent election, which Adams won with the support of Speaker of the House Henry Clay, whom Adams would controversially appoint as his secretary of state. As president, Adams called for an ambitious agenda that included federally funded infrastructure projects, the establishment of a national university, and engagement with the countries of Latin America, but Congress refused to pass many of his initiatives. During Adams's presidency, the Democratic-Republican Party split into two major camps: the National Republican Party, which supported Adams, and Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party. The Democrats proved to be more effective political organizers than Adams and his National Republican supporters, and Jackson soundly defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, making Adams the second president to fail to win re-election (his father being the first).\nRather than retiring from public service, Adams won election to the House of Representatives, where he would serve from 1831 until his death in 1848. He remains the only former president to be elected to the chamber. After narrowly losing his bids for Governor of Massachusetts and Senate re-election, Adams joined the Anti-Masonic Party in the early 1830s before joining the Whig Party, which united those opposed to President Jackson. During his time in Congress, Adams became increasingly critical of slavery and of the Southern leaders whom he believed controlled the Democratic Party. He was particularly opposed to the annexation of Texas and the Mexican\u2013American War, which he saw as a war to extend slavery and its political grip on Congress. He also led the repeal of the \"gag rule\", which had prevented the House of Representatives from debating petitions to abolish slavery. Historians concur that Adams was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of state in American history; they typically rank him as an average president, as he had an ambitious agenda but could not get it passed by Congress. By contrast, historians also view Adams in a more positive light during his post-presidency because of his vehement stance against slavery, as well as his fight for the rights of women and Native Americans.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "69_4689", "text": "John Quincy Adams was born on July 11, 1767, to John and Abigail Adams (n\u00e9e Smith) in a part of Braintree, Massachusetts, that is now Quincy.

He was the son of Charles Cecil Byers (1888\u20131957), a Lloyd's underwriter, who was Liberal candidate for Westbury at the 1935 general election. He moved with the family to Potters Bar and was educated at Westminster School, followed by Christ Church, Oxford, where he won a Blue for athletics.  At Oxford he was president of the Union of Liberal Students and president of the University Liberal Club.  His treasurer was Harold Wilson, later Labour Party prime minister.\nByers was also an exchange scholar at Milton Academy, Massachusetts. While at the University of Oxford, where he gained his degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, he met Joan Oliver, whom he married in 1939. They had a son and three daughters. Joan Oliver was a committed Liberal in her own right and was a constant help to her husband during his political career.\nByers was admitted to Gray's Inn after university, but broke off his legal education to enlist. During the Second World War, Byers served in the Royal Artillery, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and for a time serving on Field Marshal Montgomery's staff.  He was mentioned in dispatches three times, was created a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. In 1944 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.In the 1945 general election, Byers gained the formerly Conservative seat of North Dorset, with the absence of a Labour candidate being a key factor in this success. In 1946 Byers was appointed Liberal Chief Whip and gained a reputation for hard work and effective organisation both in parliament and at Liberal Party headquarters.

After the end of the war, Flinn took a history degree at the University of Manchester before spending two years as a grammar school teacher while writing a postgraduate dissertation in his spare time. In 1959, he began lecturing at the University of Edinburgh, writing an introductory school textbook for history in 1961, which was still in print at his death. He was awarded a D. Litt by Edinburgh in 1965, and two years later was appointed to a Personal Chair in Social History. After his retirement in 1978, he lectured in the United States and continental Europe, serving as president of the Economic History Society from 1980 to 1983, when he died in Stroud, Gloucestershire.Flinn established a remarkable academic reputation in less than 20 years as a university teacher, for he was already in his forties when appointed to a full-time teaching post at Edinburgh.His magnum opus, The History of the British Coal Industry.

Stoker, was commissioned as part of the National Coal Board's five volume history of the industry from the middle ages to the present time.  It was glowingly reviewed.  John Benson said \"Flinn's history is based on a prodigious amount of archival research in libraries and record offices across the British Isles [yet] this great mass of material never threatens to become overpowering\"..\nFor M.J.

We have lost not only the author of weighty contributions to industrial, social, and population history but also a man whose excellence as a teacher led to valuable works for students and whose administrative ability was devoted to his presidency of the Economic History Society; a man of great kindness, geniality and wit.For William J. Hausman, Flinn's book \"will be the standard history of the coal industry of that period for a long time\", while Arthur J.

In the 1950s, he studied painting and film while at the University of Minnesota before moving to Hollywood to become an apprentice film editor. He moved into work as a sound engineer in 1958, and apprenticed at Gotham Recording Studios, where he first started composing; he also worked for Terrytoons alongside Gene Deitch. From 1961 to 1962, when Deitch directed thirteen new Tom and Jerry shorts, Dockstader was responsible for creating the unusual, heavily reverberated sound effects heard throughout them; he also wrote the shorts Mouse into Space and Landing Stripling.\nDockstader's first record, Eight Electronic Pieces, was released in 1960, and segments were later used as the soundtrack to Italian film director Federico Fellini's Fellini Satyricon (1969). He continued to create music throughout the first half of the decade, working principally with tape manipulation effects. In 1966, Owl Records released four albums of his work from this period, including Quatermass. He achieved modest recognition and radio play alongside the likes of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Edgard Var\u00e8se, and John Cage.\nIn 1961, he applied to use the facilities at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center and was denied access in separate rejection letters penned by Vladimir Ussachevsky and Milton Babbitt. Ussachevsky\u2019s official reason was the \u201coverstrained\u201d scheduling of the studios, although it was suspected that Dockstader's lack of academic training was a factor in the decision. After leaving Gotham Recording Studios in the late 1960s, he formed the audio-visual service Westport Communications Group along with business partner, and former Gotham executive, Fred Hertz. The company focused on corporate clients and produced award-winning educational films for the American Heritage series.\nDockstader was also a prolific writer, with several articles published by Electronic Music Review and The Musical Quarterly.\nIn the early 1990s, Starkland re-released most of the content of Dockstader\u2019s out-of-print Owl records, along with previously unreleased material.

In the 1950s, he studied painting and film while at the University of Minnesota before moving to Hollywood to become an apprentice film editor. He moved into work as a sound engineer in 1958, and apprenticed at Gotham Recording Studios, where he first started composing; he also worked for Terrytoons alongside Gene Deitch. From 1961 to 1962, when Deitch directed thirteen new Tom and Jerry shorts, Dockstader was responsible for creating the unusual, heavily reverberated sound effects heard throughout them; he also wrote the shorts Mouse into Space and Landing Stripling.\nDockstader's first record, Eight Electronic Pieces, was released in 1960, and segments were later used as the soundtrack to Italian film director Federico Fellini's Fellini Satyricon (1969). He continued to create music throughout the first half of the decade, working principally with tape manipulation effects. In 1966, Owl Records released four albums of his work from this period, including Quatermass. He achieved modest recognition and radio play alongside the likes of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Edgard Var\u00e8se, and John Cage.\nIn 1961, he applied to use the facilities at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center and was denied access in separate rejection letters penned by Vladimir Ussachevsky and Milton Babbitt. Ussachevsky\u2019s official reason was the \u201coverstrained\u201d scheduling of the studios, although it was suspected that Dockstader's lack of academic training was a factor in the decision. After leaving Gotham Recording Studios in the late 1960s, he formed the audio-visual service Westport Communications Group along with business partner, and former Gotham executive, Fred Hertz. The company focused on corporate clients and produced award-winning educational films for the American Heritage series.\nDockstader was also a prolific writer, with several articles published by Electronic Music Review and The Musical Quarterly.\nIn the early 1990s, Starkland re-released most of the content of Dockstader\u2019s out-of-print Owl records, along with previously unreleased material.

Within 3 months she was in Delano, California, working for Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers (UFW). She later worked in organizing grape and lettuce boycotts in Detroit and Cleveland in support of agricultural labor strikes in California. In 1972 Loesch became one of the founding members of the Pax (Peace) Center in Erie, Pennsylvania, joining Sr. Mary Lou Kownacki, OSB, in forming a Catholic feminist peace community. This group, comprising Benedictine Sisters and lay associates, was organized more or less on the Catholic Worker model, combining activism with the Works of Mercy (soup kitchen, homeless shelter work. etc.) The Pax Center, together with other Catholic antiwar activist groups, soon morphed into Pax Christi USA, the American affiliate of Pax Christi, an international Catholic peace movement.\nIn the late 1970s, Loesch became an activist associated with the \"Mobilization for Survival\", a coalition which opposed nuclear weapons. She became convinced that abortion and the nuclear arms race were moral equivalents, and advocated partnership between the peace and anti-abortion movements. In 1979, she founded the \"bridge\" organization Prolifers for Survival, which operated until 1987. She has written extensively on these and related subjects. The larger Consistent Life Ethic movement grew partly out of her writing and activism. Her articles or essays (many searchable via \"Juli Loesch\" or \"Juli Loesch Wiley\") have appeared in, among other publications, the New Oxford Review, the National Catholic Reporter, the National Catholic Register, Consistent Life, Commonweal, Sojourners, Caelum et Terra, and Touchstone.

Sharif was elected Prime Minister in 1990, but Khan dismissed his government on similar charges three years later. The Supreme Court overturned the dismissal, but the gridlock ultimately led to both men resigning in 1993.

He was born at Nuremberg, and died at Weimar.\nHe studied philology, especially Oriental, and philosophy at Altdorf from 1664 to 1669, in which year he went to Jena and became a disciple of the celebrated Johannes Mus\u00e4us, the representative of the middle party in the Syncretistic Controversy, whose daughter he married in 1674. Taking his doctor\u2019s degree the same year, in 1675 he became professor of church history at the university, and lectured with great success on several different branches of theology.\nIn 1682 he was chosen to represent the Protestant side in the negotiations with the papal legate Nicolas Steno, bishop of Titiopolis, for reunion of the Churches. He was three times rector at Jena before he was called by the elector Frederick III, in 1694, as professor and provisional rector to the new university of Halle. Here his devotion to strict orthodoxy brought him into conflict with some of his colleagues, and the pietistic movement also gave him trouble, so that after a year he was glad to accept the combined positions of chief court preacher,  superintendent, and pastor at Weimar \u2014 which, however, he held only a few months until his death.\nHe left a name in the history of theology, especially by his dogmatic compendium, which still preserves the early Protestant traditions among High Lutherans, especially in America. The Jena theologians, and Johannes Musaeus in particular, had been asked by Ernest the Pious to draw up such a work, to take the place of the antiquated Hutter, and Mus\u00e6us urged his son-in-law to do it. The first edition appeared in 1686, the second, enlarged, in 1691, and it has been frequently reprinted since. It was commended for general use as a textbook by its method, its conciseness, and its absence of mere polemics. It was obviously, however, intended by its author as a vindication of the Jena theology, which had been sharply attacked from Wittenberg, and lay under some suspicion of syncretism. Its dependence upon Mus\u00e6us is really the distinguishing feature of the book, which is largely a compilation from him. Baier\u2019s other works include polemical writings against Erbermann, a convert to Roman Catholicism and a Jesuit, and against the Quakers; and three other\ncompendiums, published after his death (1698), one of exegetical, and one of moral theology, as well as one of the history of dogma. His read significance lies in the fact that he handed on and popularized the theology of Mus\u00e6us; and his work was continued by Buddeus, whom he left at Halle as professor of moral philosophy.", "hasanswer": true}]}

After receiving a BA from Tulane University in 1966 and an MA from the University of California, Berkeley in 1968, he arrived in the former Soviet Union for the first time in 1970 as a graduate student starting work in architectural photography, although he did not seriously study the craft of photography until 1974. Brumfield earned a Ph.D in Slavic studies at the University of California, Berkeley in 1973 and held a position of assistant professor at Harvard University in 1974\u20131980.In 1983 Brumfield, formerly a generalist of Slavic studies, established himself in the history of architecture with his first book, Gold in azure: one thousand years of Russian architecture. It was followed by The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture (1991), Russian housing in the modern age: design and social history (1993), A History of Russian Architecture (1993, Notable Book of that year and a best seller\naccording to The New York Times), Lost Russia: Photographing the Ruins of Russian Architecture (1995), Landmarks of Russian Architecture: A Photographic Survey (1997) and Commerce in Russian urban culture: 1861-1914 (English edition 2001, Russian edition 2000).\nIn 1986 Brumfield organized the first exhibit of photographic prints from the Prokudin-Gorsky Collection at the Library of Congress. Since that time Brumfield has been actively engaged in the study of Prokudin-Gorsky's photographs, including several publications for the site \"Russia Beyond the Headlines\".Brumfield lived in the former Soviet Union and Russia for a total of fifteen years, doing postgraduate research with Moscow State University and Saint Petersburg State University, but mostly travelling through the northern country, surveying and photographing the surviving relics of vernacular architecture. In a 2005 interview Brumfield, asked to tell which of those journeys stood out, picked a photo survey of Varzuga, a remote village connected to civilization by 150 kilometers of a sandy clay track. Brumfield donated a collection of around 1,100 photographs of northern Russian and Siberian architecture taken in 1999\u20132003 to the Library of Congress. Part of his archive was digitized with assistance of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the University of Washington Library. The basic collection of Brumfield's photographic work is held in the Department of Images Collections at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. The William C. Brumfield Collection at the National Gallery of Art consists of 12,500 black-and-white 8\" x 10\" photographic prints, 40,000  negatives and over 89,000 digital files, most of which are in color (nearly 149,000 in total).In 2000 Brumfield was selected a Guggenheim Fellow for Humanities - Russian History. He has been a full member of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences (RAASN) since 2002 and an honorary fellow of the Russian Academy of the Arts since 2006. He currently holds the record for most domes captured in a single photograph.\nIn 2014 the D. S. Likhachev Foundation in St. Petersburg awarded Brumfield the D. S. Likhachev Prize \"for outstanding contributions to the preservation of the historic and cultural heritage of Russia.\"In 2019 Brumfield was awarded the Order of Friendship, \u201cfor the merits in strengthening friendship and cooperation between peoples, fruitful activities for the rapprochement and mutual enrichment of cultures of nations and nationalities.\u201dIn 2021 Brumfield launched a virtual exhibition entitled \"Lost America,\" which is based on photography done in the United States primarily in the 1970s.

On 10 June 1721 he matriculated to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in 1724. He became a fellow of Trinity College in 1727, and a member of Gray's Inn the same year. Clarke was evidently knowledgeable in Roman law, and was mentioned in a poem called the causidicade as a possible Solicitor General in 1742. He became a King's Counsel (KC) in 1740, and in 1742 left Gray's Inn to join Lincoln's Inn, which he became a bencher of in 1754.In 1747 he was elected a Member of Parliament for St Michael's, and in 1754 was returned for Lostwithiel. After the death of the Master of the Rolls, Sir John Strange, Clarke was offered the position. The job was originally offered to William Murray, later Lord Mansfield, but he turned it down. If he had accepted, Clarke might instead have succeeded Murray as Attorney General for England and Wales. Clarke was officially appointed on 25 May 1754, and was knighted at the same time. In June 1754 he was invested as a Privy Councillor (PC). Clarke evidently discharged his duties \"with great credit\" for ten years, until his death in office on 13 November 1764. He was buried in the Rolls Chapel, now the main library of King's College London.Clarke was a close friend of the second Earl of Macclesfield, and this friendship combined with his unclear parentage started rumours that Clark was in fact Macclesfield's son. \"He left a large fortune behind him, which he had acquired solely by the practice of his profession, the greater part of it being bequeathed by him to the third earl of Macclesfield, the grandson of his old benefactor.\" In his will, Clarke left his Flitcroft-designed home, Branch Hill Lodge, to Macclesfield.

His father, James V. Campbell, was a New York native who came to Detroit at age three in 1826. His father was a regent and law professor at the University of Michigan and a member of the Michigan Supreme Court. His mother, Cornelia (Hotchkiss) Campbell, was also a native of New York.Campbell attended the public schools and high schools in Detroit, graduating in 1876. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1876 and completed \"the Latin and scientific course.\" While studying at Michigan, Campbell played at the halfback position for the 1879 Michigan Wolverines football team, the first football team to represent the University of Michigan. The first football game for the University of Michigan was a May 30, 1879, game against Racine at White Stockings field in Chicago. Campbell took the opening kickoff in that first football game, a play described in a newspaper the next day as follows:\n\nThe University team won the choice and let the Racine team have the kick. Johnston made a fair kick which was caught by Campbell and carried forward some distance by good runs and skilled throwing to others of our team.\nCampbell was also a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity while at Michigan. A notebook kept by Campbell while he was a student at Michigan from 1879 to 1880, which includes lecture notes from James B. Angell's courses in political economy and international law, is maintained in the collections of the University of Michigan's Bentley Historical Library. Campbell received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree from the University of Michigan in 1880.Campbell studied law at the office of Alfred Russell starting in 1880, and was admitted to the Michigan Bar in 1882. He went into practice with Russel at the firm of Russell & Campbell in 1886. The firm later became known as Russell, Campbell & Bulkley (1905\u20131907), and later as Russell, Campbell, Bulkley & Ledyard (1907\u20131912), and eventually Campbell, Bulkley & Ledyard (after 1912). Campbell specialized in conveyancing and trusts. In his history of the City of Detroit, Clarence M. Burton wrote: \"For many years Mr. Campbell has been recognized as one of the most eminent members of the Michigan bar.\"Campbell was also active in Detroit's civic affairs. In 1920, he was selected as the president of the Detroit Board of Commerce. He also served as the secretary of the Woodlawn Cemetery Association, trustee of Detroit's famed Mariners' Church, treasurer and director of the River Rouge Improvement Co., and a member of the board of trustees of the Protestant Episcopal diocese of Michigan.\nIn the 1910s, Campbell lived in the Pasadena Apartments, then one of the most fashionable apartment houses in Detroit.

He established that lead was the final decay product of uranium, noted that the lead-uranium ratio was greater in older rocks and, acting on a suggestion by Ernest Rutherford, was the first to measure the age of rocks by the decay of uranium to lead, in 1907. He got results of ages of 400 to 2200 million years, the first successful use of radioactive decay by Pb/U chemical dating. More recently, older mineral deposits have been dated to about 4.4 billion years old, close to the best estimate of the age of Earth.His work with the uranium decay series led to the discovery of the parent of radium, a new element that he named ionium. Once the existence of isotopes was established, ionium was shown to in fact be thorium-230.

She was instrumental in the creation of the Canaveral National Seashore in 1975, and the Spruce Creek Preserve, renamed the Doris Leeper Spruce Creek Preserve in memoriam. She founded the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1982. She was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 1999.\nLeeper was born on April 4, 1929, in Charlotte, North Carolina. She attended Duke University, originally intending to become a brain surgeon \u2013 the origin of her nickname \"Doc.\" She eventually graduated in 1951 with a degree in art history.In 1958, while working in the field of commercial art, she moved to the small isolated community of Eldora, Florida, situated on a barrier island between New Smyrna Beach and Titusville, Florida, along Mosquito Lagoon. As a result of her presence there, Leeper became increasingly interested in environmental preservation. By 1961, she had become a full-time artist, specializing in painting and sculpture. Her work is in over 100 collections in the U.S. and abroad.By the early 1970s, Leeper was a well-known figure in the Florida environmental movement, as an advocate for protection of Mosquito Lagoon and opposition to major development on the barrier island around Eldora. She used her growing influence to advocate for the 1975 creation of the Canaveral National Seashore (CANA), which encompassed 58,000 acres including the barrier island and Mosquito Lagoon.  Rep. Lou Frey, one of the sponsors of the Congressional authorization called Leeper \"the driving force behind the establishment of Canaveral National Seashore.\" Afterwards she was appointed to the Canaveral National Seashore Advisory Commission and founded Friends of Canaveral where she pushed for wilderness protection for the seashore.Leeper conceived of the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1977, envisioning it as a Florida artist-in-residence program in which artists of all disciplines could work with current prominent artists in a supportive and creative environment. Leeper saw the potential for an artist's residency as a place for ideas to be created, shared, and come into fruition. She soon persuaded friends and community members to join in her vision. In 1979, she convinced the Rockefeller Foundation to provide a challenge grant that soon was matched. This $25,000 in seed money was the unofficial inception of the ACA. When a prime piece of property became available on the shores of Turnbull Bay, a tidal estuary west of New Smyrna Beach, Leeper raised the $50,000 necessary to buy the ten-acre plot. Three years later, five main buildings were completed. Over the years, five more buildings were constructed and an additional 59 acres were purchased as preserve land.\nThe ACA officially opened in 1982 for the first residency with author James Dickey, sculptor Duane Hanson, and composer David Del Tredici. Since then, over 155 interdisciplinary residencies have taken place, featuring over 430 Master Artists and over 3,500 Associate Artists from around the world.\nBeginning in 1987, Leeper pushed for conservation of lands adjacent to ACA on Turnbull Bay and Spruce Creek. She founded Friends of Spruce Creek Preserve, and actively engaged in the protection of over 2,000 acres of scrub, wetlands, and archaeological sites, now known as Doris Leeper Spruce Creek Preserve.Leeper was awarded honorary doctorates from Duke and from Stetson University. She was named Florida ambassador of the arts, and inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 1999.  A 45-year retrospective of her work was held at Cornell Fine Arts Museum in 1995.When Canaveral National Seashore was established, the National Park Service bought out all of the private property owners in Eldora including Leeper who retained a life estate in her property.

Intra-action, a neologism introduced by Barad, signals an important challenge to individualist metaphysics. For Barad, phenomena or objects do not precede their interaction, rather, \"objects\" emerge through particular intra-actions. Thus, apparatuses, which produce phenomena, are not assemblages of humans and nonhumans (as in actor-network theory). Rather, they are the condition of possibility of \"humans\" and \"non-humans\", not merely as ideational concepts, but in their materiality. Apparatuses are \"material-discursive\" in that they produce determinate meanings and material beings while simultaneously excluding the production of others. What it means to matter is therefore always material-discursive. Barad takes their inspiration from physicist Niels Bohr, one of the founders of quantum physics. Barad's agential realism is at once an epistemology (theory of knowing), an ontology (theory of being), and an ethics. For this, Barad introduces the neologism \"ontoepistemology\". Because specific practices of mattering have ethical consequences, excluding other kinds of mattering, onto-epistemological practices are always in turn ethico-onto-epistemological.\nMuch of Barad's scholarly work has revolved around their concept of \"agential realism,\" and their theories hold importance for many academic fields, including science studies, STS (Science, Technology, and Society), feminist technoscience, philosophy of science, feminist theory, and, of course, physics. In addition to Bohr, their work draws on the works of thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, and Walter Benjamin, among others. \nBarad's original training was in theoretical particle physics and quantum field theory.  Their book, Meeting the Universe Halfway, (2007), includes a chapter that contains an original discovery in theoretical physics, which is largely unheard of in books that are usually categorized as \"gender studies\" or \"cultural theory\" books. In this book, Barad also argues that \"agential realism,\" is useful to the analysis of literature, social inequalities, and many other things. This claim is based on the fact that Barad's agential realism is a way of understanding the politics, ethics, and agencies of any act of observation, and indeed any kind of knowledge practice.  According to Barad, the deeply connected way that each \"thing\" is entangled with everything else in materially specific ways means that all intra-actions reconfigure the entanglements. Barad's innovative and far-reaching formulation of intra-action, which challenges the usual notion of interaction which assumes a metaphysics of individualism, offers a new formulation of causality. There are not things that interact but rather through and within intra-actions there is a differentiating-entangling so that an agential cut is enacted that cuts things together-apart (one move) such that differences exist not as absolute separations but in their inseparability (i.e., \"agential separability\" as Barad calls it). Nothing is inherently separate from anything else, but separations are enacted within phenomena. This view of knowledge provides a framework for thinking about how culture and habits of thought can make some things visible and other things easier to ignore or to never see.  For this reason, according to Barad, agential realism is useful for feminist analysis and other forms of political and social thought, even if the connection to science is not apparent.\nBarad's framework makes several other arguments, and some of them are part of larger trends in fields such as science studies and feminist technoscience (all can be found in their 2007 book, Meeting the Universe Halfway):\n\nThey define agency as a relationship and not as something that one \"has.\"\nThe scientist and the social are always part of the apparatus, and one needs to take account of this in its inseparability in analyzing the system. This differs from the view that political critiques of science seek to undermine the credibility of science; instead, Barad argues that this kind of critique actually makes for better, more credible science.\nThey argue that politics and ethical issues are always part of scientific work, and only are made to seem separate by specific historical circumstances that encourage people to fail to see those connections. One example they discuss is the ethics of developing nuclear weapons to argue this point, by claiming that the ethics and politics are part of how such weapons were developed and understood, and therefore part of science, and not merely of the \"philosophy of science\" or the \"ethics of science.\"  This differs from the usual view that one can strive for a politics-free, bias-less science.\nNevertheless, they argue against epistemological relativism, and offer an important alternative to the usual conception of objectivity.\nThey also reject the idea that science is \"only\" a language game or set of fictions produced only by human constructions and concepts. Although the scientist is part of the \"intra-action\" of the experiment, humans (and their cultural constructs) do not have complete control over everything that happens.
