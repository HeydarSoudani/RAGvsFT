It is the second largest tyre manufacturer in the world behind Bridgestone and larger than both Goodyear and Continental. In addition to the Michelin brand, it also owns the Kl\u00e9ber tyres company, Uniroyal-Goodrich Tire Company, SASCAR, Bookatable and Camso brands. Michelin is also notable for its Red and Green travel guides, its roadmaps, the Michelin stars that the Red Guide awards to restaurants for their cooking, and for its company mascot Bibendum, colloquially known as the Michelin Man, who is a humanoid consisting of tyres.\nMichelin's numerous inventions include the removable tyre, the pneurail (a tyre for rubber-tyred metros) and the radial tyre. Michelin manufactures tyres for Space Shuttles, aircraft, automobiles, heavy equipment, motorcycles, and bicycles.  In 2012, the group produced 166 million tyres at 69 facilities located in 18 countries.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "159_65262", "text": "In 1889, two brothers, \u00c9douard Michelin (1859\u20131940) and Andr\u00e9 Michelin (1853\u20131931), ran a farm implement business in Clermont-Ferrand, France.  One day, a cyclist whose pneumatic tyre needed repair turned up at the factory.  The tyre was glued to the rim, and it took over three hours to remove and repair the tyre, which then needed to be left overnight to dry.  The next day, \u00c9douard Michelin took the repaired bicycle into the factory yard to test.  After only a few hundred metres, the tyre failed.  Despite the setback, \u00c9douard was enthusiastic about the pneumatic tyre, and he and his brother worked on creating their own version, one that did not need to be glued to the rim. Michelin was incorporated on 28 May 1889.  In 1891 Michelin took out its first patent for a removable pneumatic tyre which was used by Charles Terront to win the world's first long-distance cycle race, the 1891 Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Michelin operated large rubber plantations in Vietnam. Conditions at these plantations led to the famous labour movement Phu Rieng Do.\nIn 1934, Michelin introduced a tyre which, if punctured, would run on a special foam lining, a design now known as a run-flat tyre (self-supporting type).\nMichelin developed and patented a key innovation in tyre history, the 1946 radial tyre, and successfully exploited this technological innovation to become one of the world's leading tyre manufacturers. The radial was initially marketed as the \"X\" tyre. It was developed with the front-wheel-drive Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant and Citro\u00ebn 2CV in mind. Michelin had bought the then-bankrupt Citro\u00ebn in the 1930s. Because of its superiority in handling and fuel economy, use of this tyre quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. In the U.S., the outdated bias-ply tyre persisted, with a market share of 87% in 1967.In 1966, Michelin partnered with Sears to produce radial tyres under the Allstate brand and was selling 1 million units annually by 1970.In 1968, Michelin opened its first North American sales office, and was able to grow that market for its products rapidly; by 1989 the company had a 10% market share for OEM tyres purchased by American automobile makers.Also in 1968, Consumer Reports, an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of the radial construction, setting off a rapid decline in Michelin's competitor technology. In the U.S., the radial tyre now has a market share of 100%.In addition to the private label and replacement tyre market, Michelin scored an early OEM tyre win in North America, when it received the contract for the 1970 Continental Mark III, the first American car with radial tyres fitted as standard.In 1989, Michelin acquired the recently merged tyre and rubber manufacturing divisions of the American firms B.F. Goodrich Company (founded in 1870) and Uniroyal, Inc. (founded in 1892 as the United States Rubber Company) from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.  Uniroyal Australia had already been bought by Bridgestone in 1980. This purchase included the Norwood, North Carolina manufacturing plant which supplied tyres to the U.S. Space Shuttle Program.As of 1 September 2008, Michelin is again the world's largest tyre manufacturer after spending two years as number two behind Bridgestone. Michelin produces tyres in France, Serbia, Poland, Spain, Germany, the US, the UK, Canada, Brazil, Thailand, Japan, India, Italy and several other countries.

In 2019, Michelin announced that plants in Germany and France are to be closed soon.Michelin also controls 90% of Taurus Tyre in Hungary, as well as Kormoran, a Polish brand.\nIn December 2018, Michelin acquired Camso, a manufacturer of off-the-road tyres, tracks, and accessories for power sports, agriculture, material handling and construction markets.On 22 January 2019, it was announced that Michelin had acquired Indonesian manufacturer Multistrada Arah Sarana, which produces Achilles Radial and Corsa tyres.

In the U.S., the outdated bias-ply tyre persisted, with a market share of 87% in 1967.In 1966, Michelin partnered with Sears to produce radial tyres under the Allstate brand and was selling 1 million units annually by 1970.In 1968, Michelin opened its first North American sales office, and was able to grow that market for its products rapidly; by 1989 the company had a 10% market share for OEM tyres purchased by American automobile makers.Also in 1968, Consumer Reports, an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of the radial construction, setting off a rapid decline in Michelin's competitor technology. In the U.S., the radial tyre now has a market share of 100%.In addition to the private label and replacement tyre market, Michelin scored an early OEM tyre win in North America, when it received the contract for the 1970 Continental Mark III, the first American car with radial tyres fitted as standard.In 1989, Michelin acquired the recently merged tyre and rubber manufacturing divisions of the American firms B.F. Goodrich Company (founded in 1870) and Uniroyal, Inc. (founded in 1892 as the United States Rubber Company) from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.  Uniroyal Australia had already been bought by Bridgestone in 1980. This purchase included the Norwood, North Carolina manufacturing plant which supplied tyres to the U.S. Space Shuttle Program.As of 1 September 2008, Michelin is again the world's largest tyre manufacturer after spending two years as number two behind Bridgestone. Michelin produces tyres in France, Serbia, Poland, Spain, Germany, the US, the UK, Canada, Brazil, Thailand, Japan, India, Italy and several other countries. On 15 January 2010, Michelin announced the closing of its Ota, Japan plant, which employs 380 workers and makes the Michelin X-Ice tyre. Production of the X-Ice will be moved to Europe, North America, and elsewhere in Asia. In 2019, Michelin announced that plants in Germany and France are to be closed soon.Michelin also controls 90% of Taurus Tyre in Hungary, as well as Kormoran, a Polish brand.\nIn December 2018, Michelin acquired Camso, a manufacturer of off-the-road tyres, tracks, and accessories for power sports, agriculture, material handling and construction markets.On 22 January 2019, it was announced that Michelin had acquired Indonesian manufacturer Multistrada Arah Sarana, which produces Achilles Radial and Corsa tyres.

The eighth-largest American manufacturing company in 1941 and the ninth largest in 1979, Gulf Oil was one of the Seven Sisters oil companies. Prior to its merger with Standard Oil of California, Gulf was one of the chief instruments of the Mellon family fortune; both Gulf and Mellon Financial had their headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with Gulf's headquarters, the Gulf Tower, being Pittsburgh's tallest building until the completion of the U.S. Steel Tower.\nGulf Oil Corporation (GOC) ceased to exist as an independent company in 1985, when it merged with Standard Oil of California (SOCAL), with both re-branding as Chevron in the United States. Gulf Canada, Gulf's main Canadian subsidiary, was sold the same year with retail outlets to Ultramar and Petro-Canada and what became Gulf Canada Resources to Olympia & York. However, the Gulf brand name and a number of the constituent business divisions of GOC survived. Gulf has experienced a significant revival since 1990, emerging as a flexible network of allied business interests based on partnerships, franchises and agencies.\nGulf, in its present incarnation, is a \"new economy\" business. It employs very few people directly and its assets are mainly in the form of intellectual property: brands, product specifications and scientific expertise. The rights to the brand in the United States are owned by Gulf Oil Limited Partnership (GOLC), which operates over 2,100 service stations and several petroleum terminals; it is headquartered in Wellesley, Massachusetts. The corporate vehicle at the center of the Gulf network outside the United States, Spain and Portugal is Gulf Oil International, a company owned by the Hinduja Group. The company's focus is primarily in the provision of downstream products and services to a mass market through joint ventures, strategic alliances, licensing agreements, and distribution arrangement. In Spain and Portugal, the Gulf brand is now owned by TotalEnergies SE.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "159_65266", "text": "By 1980, Gulf exhibited many of the characteristics of a giant corporation that had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 was in the early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.Its undoing as an independent company began in 1982 when T. Boone Pickens, an Amarillo, Texas, oilman and corporate raider (or greenmailer), and owner of Mesa Petroleum, made an offer for the comparatively larger (but still considered \"non-major\" oil company) Cities Service Company (more generally known by the name Citgo) from Tulsa, Oklahoma which was then trading in the low 20s. Pickens first privately offered $45 a share for a friendly takeover and then later made a $50 a share public offer when Cities' CEO rejected the friendly offer. Gulf forestalled Mesa's takeover attempt by offering $63 a share in a friendly offer which Cities (by then trading at $37) accepted. Cities then bought out Pickens for $55 a share. Once Pickens was gone, Gulf reneged on its buyout offer, supposedly over a dispute regarding accuracy of Cities Service's reserves, and the stock price of Cities plunged, triggering stockholder lawsuits as well as distrust for Gulf's management on Wall Street and among financing investment banks who bet big in assisting Gulf to defeat Mesa only to be left broke when Gulf backed out. Cities Service was ultimately sold to Occidental Petroleum, and the retail operations were resold to Southland Corporation, the operators of 7-Eleven stores. Gulf's termination of the Cities Service acquisition resulted in more than 15 years of shareholder litigation against Gulf (and later Chevron).\nWith declining margins in the industry and left without Citgo's reserves, Mesa and its investor partners kept hunting for a takeover target, only to discover while fighting Gulf for Citgo how increasingly top-heavy its portfolio and declining reserves were undervaluing its overall assets. They subtly but quickly acquired 4.9 percent of Gulf Oil's stock by early fall 1983, just shy of having to declare themselves and their intent at 5 percent to the SEC.  In the ten days allowed to prepare the SEC filing, Mesa and its investor partners accelerated buying to 11 percent of the company's stock, larger than the founding Mellon family's share, by October 1983. Gulf responded to Mesa's interest by calling a shareholders' meeting for late November 1983 and subsequently engaged in a proxy war on changing the corporation's by-laws to minimize arbitrage. Pickens made loud criticisms of the existing Gulf management and offered an alternative business plan intended to release shareholder value through a royalty trust that management argued would \"slim down\" Gulf's market share. Pickens had acquired the reputation of being a corporate raider whose skill lay in making profits out of bidding for companies but without actually acquiring them. During the early 1980s alone, he made failed bids for Cities Service, General American Oil, Gulf, Phillips Petroleum and Unocal. The process of making such bids would promote a frenzy of asset divestiture and debt reduction in the target companies. This is a standard defensive tactic calculated to boost the current share price, although possibly at the expense of long-term strategic advantage. The target shares would rise sharply in price, at which point Pickens would dispose of his interest at a substantial profit.Gulf management and directors took the view that the Mesa bid represented an undervaluation of the Gulf business as a long-term going concern and that it was not in the interest of Gulf shareholders. James Lee, Gulf's CEO and Chairman, even claimed during the November 1983 shareholders meeting to address the Mesa ownership that Pickens' royalty trust idea was nothing more than a \"get-rich-quick scheme\" that would undermine the corporation's profit potential in the coming decades. Gulf, therefore, sought to resist Pickens by various means, including refiling as a Delaware corporation, voiding the ability of shareholders to cumulatively vote (fearing that Pickens would use his shares to gain control of the board) and listening to offers from Ashland Oil (which would double Gulf's price from its pre-Mesa level), General Electric (two years before it took over the media company NBC/RCA) and finally Chevron to act as its white knight in 1984. Gulf divested many of its worldwide operating subsidiaries and then merged with Chevron by the spring of 1985. The Mesa group of investors was reported to have made a profit of $760 million ($2,153 million today) when it assigned its Gulf shares to Chevron.  Pickens has claimed that after realizing a more than doubling of stock appreciation for Gulf shareholders (as well as its management that fought him at every turn), Mesa's shares were the last to be paid out by Chevron.\nThe forced merger of Gulf and Chevron was controversial, with the U.S. Senate considering legislation to freeze oil industry mergers for a year\u2014before the Reagan administration made it known it opposed government intervention in the matter and would veto any bill.  However, Pickens and Lee (Gulf's CEO) were summoned to testify before the Senate months before the merger was hammered out and the matter was referred to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC only approved the deal subject to strict conditions. Never before had a \"small operator\" successfully taken apart a Fortune 500 corporation, or in Gulf's case a \"Fortune 10\" corporation. The merger sent even deeper shock waves through the long-time exclusive \"Seven Sisters\" club of major integrated oil companies that defined themselves as elevated from the \"non-major independents\". A board member of Exxon even admitted in the mid-1980s that \"mostly all we talk about in board meetings anymore is T. Boone Pickens\".  Chevron, to settle with the government antitrust requirements, sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States to British Petroleum (BP) and Cumberland Farms in 1985 as well as some of the international operations.\nThe effect on the Pittsburgh area was severe as close to 900 PhD and research jobs and 600 headquarters (accounting, law, clerical) jobs were transferred to California or cut, a payroll of $54 million ($158.4 million today) and corporate charity to 50 Western Pennsylvania organizations worth $2 million/year ($5.9 million/year today). These losses were mitigated some with the donation of Gulf Labs in suburban north Pittsburgh to the University of Pittsburgh to be used as a research business incubator along with $5 million ($14.2 million today) in maintenance and seed money.

In 1968, the Baruch School of Business was spun off as Baruch College, an independent senior college in the CUNY system.The first president of the new college (1969\u20131970) was the previous Federal Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Robert C. Weaver. In 1971, the college appointed Clyde Wingfield, a noted educator, as its president. He was succeeded by economist Joel Edwin Segall in 1977. Segall recruited several well-known faculty members to the School of Business and established the college's permanent home on Lower Lexington Avenue. Matthew Goldstein was president of the school from 1991 to 1998 (he later went on to serve as the Chancellor of CUNY from 1999 to 2013). He was responsible for raising admissions requirements and creating the School of Public Affairs in 1994. Edward Regan, former comptroller of New York state, served as president from 2000 to 2004. During his tenure, test scores rose, student retention rates increased, and many new faculty members were hired. In 2001, the Vertical Campus opened and Baruch College accepted its first students from the CUNY Honors College, now known as the Macaulay Honors College. The college also implemented a common core curriculum for all undergraduates.Kathleen Waldron became the president in 2004. Under Waldron, Baruch College received large donations from its alumni, which resulted in the Vertical Campus, 23rd Street building, and Performing Arts complex being renamed in honor of the three largest donors respectively. Alumni giving has increased under \"Baruch Means Business,\" a $150 million capital campaign. In August 2009, Waldron resigned from her position to become a University Professor at the Graduate Center. Stan Altman, the former dean of the School of Public Affairs from 1999 to 2005, was named interim president.On February 22, 2010, Mitchel Wallerstein, Dean of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, was appointed as the president of the college. He took office on August 2, 2010, and remained until June 30, 2020, after which he became a University Professor at CUNY. Under his leadership, Baruch College established degree programs with universities globally, ranked as a top college for social mobility, and achieved the best graduation rate within the CUNY system.Baruch College was the scene of student protests in 2011 as a result of tuition hikes.

The United States, keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO.Further Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led Danish Prime Minister Hans Hedtoft to propose, on 13 August 1951, a consultative interparliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden during a meeting in Copenhagen on 15\u201316 March 1952. The council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president.

Any telecommunication regulation was transferred to the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC).\nThe junta appointed General Saprang Kalayanamitr as the new chairman of the board of directors for both CAT and TOT.

The total amount paid by the private telecom firms did not change.  The Surayud government's excise tax cancellation meant that TOT and CAT would receive their full concession payments.  However, TOT and CAT were then forced to increase their dividends to the Ministry of Finance to account for their increased income.On 30 November 2013, during the mass protests going on in Bangkok, a group of unidentified protesters infiltrated CAT's headquarter, which hosted its data center, to cut off its electricity.

It became a public company (with 100% of shares held by the Thai government) with its name CAT, where CAT is no longer an abbreviation for the Communications Authority of Thailand. Any telecommunication regulation was transferred to the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC).\nThe junta appointed General Saprang Kalayanamitr as the new chairman of the board of directors for both CAT and TOT.  Saprang was accused by the founders of PTV, a new satellite television station, of being behind CAT's refusal to grant an internet link from Bangkok to a satellite up-link station in Hong Kong.  PTV was established by some previous executives of the Thai Rak Thai party.  CAT, however, claimed that it never received PTV's application for internet access.The junta also canceled the Thaksin government's telecom excise tax policy. The Thaksin government imposed an excise tax on private fixed and cellular services, and then allowed telecom companies to deduct the amount they paid in excise tax from concession fees to TOT and CAT.  The total amount paid by the private telecom firms did not change.  The Surayud government's excise tax cancellation meant that TOT and CAT would receive their full concession payments.  However, TOT and CAT were then forced to increase their dividends to the Ministry of Finance to account for their increased income.On 30 November 2013, during the mass protests going on in Bangkok, a group of unidentified protesters infiltrated CAT's headquarter, which hosted its data center, to cut off its electricity. This affected roughly 92,000 clients of the company and resulted in about 300 million baht ($10 million) in lost transactions. Upon the system shut down, internet was inaccessible, phone lines were down, and ATMs were out of service.CAT is a network operator that hosts mobile virtual network operators (MVNO). CAT has two MVNOs operating on its 850 MHz network:\nTruemove H, a subsidiary of True Corporation\n168, formerly known as 365 3G CommunicationsOn 7 January 2021, CAT Telecom agreed to merge with TOT Public Company Limited into a new company, National Telecom Public Company Limited (NT) according to the cabinet resolution by Ministry of Digital Economy and Society under Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The group formed in New York City in 1985, born out of a picket against the Museum of Modern Art the previous year. The core of the group's work is bringing gender and racial inequality into focus within the greater arts community and society at large.  The Guerrilla Girls employ culture jamming in the form of posters, books, billboards, lectures, interviews, public appearances and internet interventions to expose disparities, discrimination, and corruption (the latter includes conflicts of interest within museums). They also often use humor in their work to make their serious messages engaging. The Guerrilla Girls are known for their \"guerrilla\" tactics, hence their name, such as hanging up posters or staging surprise exhibitions. To remain anonymous, members don gorilla masks. To permit individual identities in interviews, they use pseudonyms that refer to deceased female artists such as Frida Kahlo, K\u00e4the Kollwitz, and Alice Neel, as well as writers and activists, such as Gertrude Stein and Harriet Tubman.

Grimsby Town is the most successful team of the three professional clubs in historic Lincolnshire, being the only one to play top-flight English football. It is also the only club of the three to reach an FA Cup semi-final (doing so on two occasions, both times during the 1930s). It has also spent more time in the English game's first and second tiers than any other club from Lincolnshire. Notable former managers include Bill Shankly, who went on to guide Liverpool to three League titles, two FA Cups and a UEFA Cup triumph, and Lawrie McMenemy who, after securing promotion to the then Third Division in 1972, moved to Southampton where he won the FA Cup in 1976. Alan Buckley is the club's most successful manager; he had three spells between 1988 and 2008, guiding the club to three promotions and two appearances at Wembley Stadium during the 1997\u201398 season, winning both the Football League Trophy and the Football League Second Division play-off Final. In 2008, Buckley took Grimsby to the capital again, but lost out to MK Dons in the final of the Football League Trophy. The Mariners had also reached the Football League Two play-off Final in 2006 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, but lost the match 1\u20130 to Cheltenham Town, Later trips to Wembley in 2013 and 2016 saw them defeated in the FA Trophy final by Wrexham and FC Halifax Town respectively, having also lost at the venue in the 2015 National League play-off final to Bristol Rovers before finally gaining promotion by winning the 2016 final against Forest Green Rovers. Grimsby were again relegated out of the Football League in 2021, but secured an immediate promotion at the first attempt with victory over Solihull Moors in the 2022 National League play-off final at the London Stadium.

There have been numerous delays to the development of the new stadium. The plans have been met with resistance from many residents of the local area surrounding the proposed stadium site, but other factors have also slowed progress. One of the most notable difficulties for the club was in demonstrating how it planned to finance the scheme. As a result, they later amended their proposal to include a retail park on the site, which would help to fund the development. This raised other problems, due to a rival proposal by the property developer Henry Boot, who are continuing with plans for their own retail park, which will be in direct competition with the Grimsby Town site and which has also been approved by the local council. Henry Boot attempted to have the football team's development plan stopped, by asking for it to be sent for judicial review by the Government, however their attempt failed.

Situated inside the Findus Stand at Blundell Park, is \"McMenemy's Function Suite\", named after former manager Lawrie McMenemy.\nSince the late 1990s, there have been plans for a new 20,200-seat stadium at nearby Great Coates \u2013 tentatively titled the Conoco Stadium after a naming rights deal with the American energy corporation ConocoPhillips. There have been numerous delays to the development of the new stadium. The plans have been met with resistance from many residents of the local area surrounding the proposed stadium site, but other factors have also slowed progress. One of the most notable difficulties for the club was in demonstrating how it planned to finance the scheme. As a result, they later amended their proposal to include a retail park on the site, which would help to fund the development. This raised other problems, due to a rival proposal by the property developer Henry Boot, who are continuing with plans for their own retail park, which will be in direct competition with the Grimsby Town site and which has also been approved by the local council. Henry Boot attempted to have the football team's development plan stopped, by asking for it to be sent for judicial review by the Government, however their attempt failed. Currently, the Grimsby Town stadium development proposal has satisfied all the conditions that were imposed by planning officials and consent for the project has been granted. Initial estimates had suggested that the club would be able to move to the new stadium for the start of the 2011\u201312 season. However, as a result of the ongoing global recession, the club has halted all progress on the new development and it is unlikely that any work will begin until an upturn in the economy.\nAs of the 2012\u201313 season, the GTFC Supporters Trust known as the 'Mariners Trust' has taken over responsibility for the operation of most of the bars at the stadium, which hopefully will lead to refurbishment, and new ideas from fans as to how the bars operate.\nPlans were underway to relocate the club to land at the side of the Peaks Parkway in Grimsby. As of 2020, new plans have been agreed with the council, Grimsby Town FC and The Freemen of Grimsby to build the stadium on recently cleared land off Freeman Street.", "hasanswer": false}]}

BSB had been aware of the impending launch of Astra when it submitted its proposal to the IBA in 1986 but had discounted it, partly on advice from the IBA that it would not have been possible for Sky to securely scramble an analogue PAL signal and a prediction that satisfactory reception from a medium-powered satellite such as Astra would not be possible with a dish of under 1.2 metres, which would require individual planning permission for each customer. Lazard Brothers, the Pearson subsidiary responsible for BSB's first fundraising memorandum, reportedly regarded Astra as technology-led rather than programming-led and, therefore, an unlikely threat.\nThe stage was set for a dramatic confrontation: BSB, expecting to be the United Kingdom's only satellite service, was faced with an aggressive drive by Murdoch's Sky to be the first service to launch. As Britain's official satellite television provider, BSB had high hopes as the company planned to provide a mixture of highbrow programming and popular entertainment, from arts and opera to blockbuster movies and music videos. The service would also be technically superior, broadcasting in the D-MAC (Multiplexed Analogue Components type D) system dictated by the European Union regulations with potentially superior picture sharpness, digital stereo sound, and the potential to show widescreen programming; rather than the existing PAL system. BSB claimed that Sky's PAL pictures would be too degraded by satellite transmission, and that in any case, BSB would broadcast superior programming. SES (later operators of the O3b data satellites and others with names including AMC, Ciel, NSS, QuetzSat, YahSat and SES, and formerly at that time, the Astra TV satellite operator), had no regulatory permission to broadcast, had plans (initially) for only one satellite with no backup, and the European satellite launch vehicle Ariane suffered repeated failures. However, SES used the resulting delay time to re-engineer the satellite to reduce the dish size needed, which would otherwise have been larger than 60 cm (24\").\nTo distance itself from Sky and its dish antennas, BSB announced a new type of flat-plate satellite antenna called a \"squarial\" (i.e., \"square aerial\").

Founded in 1996 in San Marcos, California, it is the largest brewery in Southern California. Based on 2020 sales volume it is the ninth largest craft brewery in the United States.The brewery's first beer was Stone Pale Ale, which was considered to be its flagship ale until it was retired in 2015. The company's best known brand is Arrogant Bastard Ale, which has been described as a \"watershed beer\" that \"put San Diego on the craft brew map.\" Most of Stone's beers are characteristic of west-coast craft brews, meaning that they have a high hop content. Compared to the macro-produced lagers, many Stone brews feature alcohol percentages that are well above average, ranging from 4.8% to 13%.Stone Brewing is rated as a \"world class brewery\" by the two largest beer enthusiast websites, RateBeer and BeerAdvocate. Stone Brewing has been voted by the readers of Beer Advocate as the #1 \"All Time Top Brewery on Planet Earth.\"In June 2022, Stone and Sapporo Breweries announced that they had reached an agreement for Sapporo to purchase Stone Brewing, with the purchase expected to close in August 2022.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "159_65428", "text": "Stone opened in San Marcos in 1996 at the location currently home to Port Brewing Company and The Lost Abbey.

Historically, Ajax (named after the legendary Greek hero) is the most successful club in the Netherlands, with 36 Eredivisie titles and 20 KNVB Cups. It has continuously played in the Eredivisie since the league's inception in 1956, and along with Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven, it is one of the country's \"big three\" clubs that have dominated that competition.\nAjax was one of the most successful clubs in the world in the 20th century. According to the International Federation of Football History & Statistics, Ajax was the seventh-most successful European club of the 20th century and The World's Club Team of the Year in 1992. According to German magazine Kicker, Ajax was the second-most successful European club of the 20th century. The club is one of five teams that have earned the right to keep the European Cup and to wear a multiple-winner badge. In 1972, they completed the continental treble by winning the Eredivisie, KNVB Cup, and the European Cup. They also won the first (albeit unofficial) European Super Cup against Rangers in January 1973. Ajax's most recent international trophies are the 1995 Intercontinental Cup, 1995 UEFA Super Cup and the 1995 Champions League, where they defeated Milan in the final; they lost the 1996 Champions League final on penalties to Juventus. In 1995, Ajax was crowned as World Team of the Year by World Soccer magazine.\nAjax is also one of four teams to win the continental treble and the Intercontinental Cup or Club World Cup in the same season/calendar year; this was achieved in the 1971\u201372 season.

The club achieved promotion to the highest level of Dutch football in 1911 and had its first major success in 1917, winning the KNVB Beker, the Netherlands' national cup. The following season, Ajax became national champion for the first time. The club defended its title in 1918\u201319, becoming the only team to achieve an unbeaten season in the Netherlands Football League Championship.Throughout the 1920s, Ajax was a strong regional power, winning the Eerste Klasse West division in 1921, 1927 and 1928, but could not maintain its success at the national level. This changed in the 1930s, with the club winning five national championships (1931, 1932, 1934, 1937, 1939), making it the most successful Dutch team of the decade. Ajax won its second KNVB Cup in 1942\u201343, and an eighth Dutch title in 1946\u201347, the last season the club was managed by Englishman Jack Reynolds, who, up to this point, had overseen all of its national championship successes as well as its 1917 KNVB Cup win.In 1956, the first season of the Netherlands' new professional league, the Eredivisie, was played with Ajax participating as a founding member. The Amsterdam club became the first national champions under the new format and made its debut in the European Champion Clubs' Cup the following year, losing to Hungarian champions Vasas SC 6\u20132 on aggregate at the quarter-final stage. The team was again Eredivisie champions in 1960 and won a third KNVB Cup in 1961.\nIn 1965, Rinus Michels, who had played for the club between 1946 and 1958, was appointed manager of Ajax, implementing his philosophy of Total Football which was to become synonymous with both Ajax and the Netherlands national team. A year earlier, Johan Cruyff, who would go on to become widely regarded as the greatest Dutch footballer of all-time, made his debut. Between them, Michels and Cruyff led Ajax through the most successful period in its history, winning seven Eredivisie titles, four KNVB Cups and three European Cups.\nAjax won the Dutch championship in 1966, 1967 and 1968, and reached the 1969 European Cup final, losing to Milan. During the 1966\u201367 season, Ajax scored a record 122 goals in an Eredivisie season and also won the KNVB Cup to achieve its first league and cup double. In 1969\u201370, Ajax won a fourth Dutch league championship and second league and cup double in five seasons, winning 27 out of 34 league matches and scoring 100 goals.The 1970\u201371 season saw Ajax retain the KNVB Cup and reach the 1971 European Cup final, where they defeated Panathinaikos 2\u20130 with goals from Dick van Dijk and Arie Haan to become continental champions for the first time, with Cruyff being named European Footballer of the Year. After this success, Michels departed to become manager of Barcelona and was replaced by the Romanian \u0218tefan Kov\u00e1cs. In Kov\u00e1cs' first season, Ajax completed a treble of the European Cup, the Eredivisie and a third consecutive KNVB Cup. The following season, the team beat Argentine Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente to win the 1972 Intercontinental Cup and retained their Eredivisie and European Cup titles, becoming the first club to win three consecutive European Cups since Real Madrid in the 1950s.\nIn 1973, Michels' Barcelona broke the world transfer record to bring Cruyff to Catalonia. Kov\u00e1cs also departed to become manager of the France national team, signalling the end of this period of international success.In 1976\u201377, Ajax won its first domestic championship in four seasons and recorded a double of the Eredivisie and KNVB Cup two years later.\nThe early 1980s saw the return of Cruyff to the club, as well as the emergence of young players Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard. The team won back-to-back Eredivisie titles in 1982 and 1983, with all three playing a significant role in the latter. After Cruyff's sale to rivals Feyenoord in 1983, van Basten became Ajax's key player, top scoring in the Eredivisie for four seasons between 1983\u201384 and 1986\u201387.\nIn 1985, Cruyff returned to Ajax as manager and the team ended his first season in charge with 120 goals from 34 matches. However, Ajax still finished as runner-up to PSV by eight points. The following season, Ajax again lost out on the Eredivisie title to PSV, but won the European Cup Winners' Cup, its first continental trophy in 14 years. After this, Cruyff left the club to become manager of Barcelona and Rijkaard and van Basten were sold to Sporting CP and Milan respectively. Despite these losses, Ajax reached a second consecutive Cup Winners' Cup final in 1988, where they lost to Belgian club KV Mechelen.The 1988\u201389 season saw Dennis Bergkamp, a young forward who had first appeared under Cruyff in 1986, establish himself as a regular goalscorer for Ajax. Bergkamp helped Ajax to the Eredivisie title and was the top scorer in the division in 1990\u201391, 1991\u201392 and 1992\u201393. Under the management of Louis van Gaal, Ajax won the UEFA Cup in 1992 to become the second club, after Juventus, to have won all three major European club competitions.After the sale of Bergkamp to Internazionale in 1993, van Gaal re-signed the experienced Rijkaard to complement his young Ajax team featuring academy graduates Frank and Ronald de Boer, Edwin van der Sar, Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Michael Reiziger and Winston Bogarde, as well as mercurial foreign talents Finidi George, Nwankwo Kanu and Jari Litmanen, and veteran captain Danny Blind. The team regained the Dutch championship in 1993\u201394, and won it again in 1994\u201395 and 1995\u201396 to become the first Ajax side to win three back-to-back championships since 1968. The height of van Gaal's success came in 1994\u201395, where Ajax became the first, and to date only, team to complete an entire Eredivisie season unbeaten. The team also won its first European Cup since its 1970s era, defeating Milan in the 1995 UEFA Champions League final 1\u20130, with the winning goal scored by 18-year-old Patrick Kluivert. Ajax again reached the final one year later, and was defeated on penalties by Juventus.\nAjax's return as a European force was short-lived, as van Gaal and several members of the squad soon departed to some of the continent's biggest clubs. The 2000s was a lean decade for the club, with only two Eredivisie championships won. However, Ajax's academy continued to produce star players such as Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart.\nIn 2010, Frank de Boer was appointed manager of Ajax and led the club to its first league title in seven years, and record 30th title overall, in the 2010\u201311 season. This was followed by back-to-back wins in 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313 to match his three consecutive titles as a player in the 1990s. In 2013\u201314, Ajax was again Eredivisie champions, winning four consecutive league titles for the first time in club history. After finishing as runner-up to PSV in both 2014\u201315 and 2015\u201316, de Boer resigned as Ajax head coach in May 2016.Peter Bosz took over the club and led them to the 2017 UEFA Europa League final, their first European final in 21 years. They lost to Manchester United with a lineup that was the youngest ever in a European final, averaging an age of 22 years and 282 days. For the third consecutive season, they finished runner-up in the Eredivisie, this time to Feyenoord.\nThe 2018\u201319 season for Ajax involved a remarkable run in the UEFA Champions League. Due to their runner-up finish in the 2017\u201318 Eredivisie, Ajax entered the tournament in the second qualifying round. After successive victories against Sturm Graz, Standard Li\u00e8ge and Dynamo Kyiv, they qualified for the group stage. Ajax was drawn in a group with German champions Bayern Munich, Portuguese side Benfica and Greek champions AEK Athens. Ajax finished runner-up in this group, qualifying for the knockout stages, where it was drawn against three-time defending champions Real Madrid. After losing 1\u20132 in the first leg, they defeated Real Madrid 4\u20131 in the away match, stunning the defending champions in their own stadium, the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, with an aggregate score of 5\u20133. Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107 was awarded a perfect score of 10 by L'\u00c9quipe following the match.Thus, Ajax progressed to the quarter-finals and was drawn with Italian champions Juventus. In the first leg in the Johan Cruyff Arena, they drew 1\u20131. In the second leg at the Juventus Stadium, Ajax came from behind to win 2\u20131 and 3\u20132 on aggregate. Matthijs de Ligt scored the winning goal for Ajax to help the team advance to its first Champions League semi-final since 1997. There, they would face English side Tottenham Hotspur.\nIn the first leg of the semi-final, Ajax beat Tottenham 1\u20130 away from home. In the second leg, Ajax scored twice in the first half to generate a 3\u20130 lead on aggregate. However, in the second half, Lucas Moura scored three times, including in the 6th minute of added time, resulting in Ajax losing via the away goals rule.Ajax was in first place on goal difference when the Eredivisie was declared void, preventing them being Dutch champions for the 35th time, but still qualified for the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "159_65475", "text": "The club is also particularly famous for its renowned youth programme that has produced many Dutch talents over the years \u2013 Johan Cruyff, Edwin van der Sar, Gerald Vanenburg, Frank Rijkaard, Dennis Bergkamp, Rafael van der Vaart, Patrick Kluivert, Marco van Basten, Wesley Sneijder, Maarten Stekelenburg, Nigel de Jong, Frenkie de Jong, and Matthijs de Ligt have come through the ranks and are just some of the talents who have played for Ajax.

The 2000s was a lean decade for the club, with only two Eredivisie championships won. However, Ajax's academy continued to produce star players such as Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart.\nIn 2010, Frank de Boer was appointed manager of Ajax and led the club to its first league title in seven years, and record 30th title overall, in the 2010\u201311 season. This was followed by back-to-back wins in 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313 to match his three consecutive titles as a player in the 1990s. In 2013\u201314, Ajax was again Eredivisie champions, winning four consecutive league titles for the first time in club history. After finishing as runner-up to PSV in both 2014\u201315 and 2015\u201316, de Boer resigned as Ajax head coach in May 2016.Peter Bosz took over the club and led them to the 2017 UEFA Europa League final, their first European final in 21 years. They lost to Manchester United with a lineup that was the youngest ever in a European final, averaging an age of 22 years and 282 days. For the third consecutive season, they finished runner-up in the Eredivisie, this time to Feyenoord.\nThe 2018\u201319 season for Ajax involved a remarkable run in the UEFA Champions League. Due to their runner-up finish in the 2017\u201318 Eredivisie, Ajax entered the tournament in the second qualifying round. After successive victories against Sturm Graz, Standard Li\u00e8ge and Dynamo Kyiv, they qualified for the group stage. Ajax was drawn in a group with German champions Bayern Munich, Portuguese side Benfica and Greek champions AEK Athens. Ajax finished runner-up in this group, qualifying for the knockout stages, where it was drawn against three-time defending champions Real Madrid. After losing 1\u20132 in the first leg, they defeated Real Madrid 4\u20131 in the away match, stunning the defending champions in their own stadium, the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, with an aggregate score of 5\u20133. Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107 was awarded a perfect score of 10 by L'\u00c9quipe following the match.Thus, Ajax progressed to the quarter-finals and was drawn with Italian champions Juventus. In the first leg in the Johan Cruyff Arena, they drew 1\u20131. In the second leg at the Juventus Stadium, Ajax came from behind to win 2\u20131 and 3\u20132 on aggregate. Matthijs de Ligt scored the winning goal for Ajax to help the team advance to its first Champions League semi-final since 1997. There, they would face English side Tottenham Hotspur.\nIn the first leg of the semi-final, Ajax beat Tottenham 1\u20130 away from home. In the second leg, Ajax scored twice in the first half to generate a 3\u20130 lead on aggregate. However, in the second half, Lucas Moura scored three times, including in the 6th minute of added time, resulting in Ajax losing via the away goals rule.Ajax was in first place on goal difference when the Eredivisie was declared void, preventing them being Dutch champions for the 35th time, but still qualified for the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "159_65475", "text": "The club is also particularly famous for its renowned youth programme that has produced many Dutch talents over the years \u2013 Johan Cruyff, Edwin van der Sar, Gerald Vanenburg, Frank Rijkaard, Dennis Bergkamp, Rafael van der Vaart, Patrick Kluivert, Marco van Basten, Wesley Sneijder, Maarten Stekelenburg, Nigel de Jong, Frenkie de Jong, and Matthijs de Ligt have come through the ranks and are just some of the talents who have played for Ajax.

The company's history can be traced back to 1835, when the Bounty Land Register was one of four newspapers in Illinois. Over the next century, a number of mergers followed. The company moved into radio in 1947 and began television broadcasts in 1953.\nThe company was owned by the Oakley and Lindsay families of Quincy.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "159_65563", "text": "The corporation was formed in Quincy on June 1, 1926, as Quincy Newspapers after the merger of the Quincy Herald, direct descendant of the Illinois Bounty Land Register first published in Quincy in 1835, and the Quincy Whig-Journal, descendant of the Quincy Whig founded in 1838. The two papers were combined to form a single daily paper, the Quincy Herald-Whig.The Herald was purchased in September 1891 by three men from Rockford, Charles L. Miller, Hedley John Eaton and Edmund Botsford. Miller had earlier founded the Rockford Daily Register, that city's oldest newspaper. Subsequently, Miller brought to the Herald his brother-in-law and nephew, respectively, Aaron Burr Oakley and Ray M. Oakley, the first two generations of the Oakleys in the newspaper business in Quincy. Miller spent four years in Quincy, returning to Rockford in 1896 to join Harry M. Johnson in ownership of the Rockford Republic. He retired as editor of the Republic in 1913 and died in 1921. Hedley Eaton retired in 1913 and died in 1936. Eaton's son John Dewitt Eaton stayed with the paper as Advertising Manager until his retirement in 1955.\nTwo brothers from Decatur, Frank M. Lindsay, Sr. and Arthur O. Lindsay, Sr. bought the Quincy Whig in 1915, with Arthur Lindsay taking up residence in Quincy as president and manager. Frank Lindsay remained in Decatur with the Decatur Herald and formed an association with another Illinois newspaper family, the Schaubs. In 1920, the Lindsays consolidated the Whig and The Quincy Journal, founded in 1883.\nQNI entered broadcasting in 1947, the year it started Quincy's first commercial FM station, WQDI. The following year QNI purchased Quincy Broadcasting Co. to operate WGEM, the city's second AM station. WQDI became WGEM-FM in 1953.\n\nQuincy Broadcasting produced the Quincy region's first television broadcast on September 4, 1953, with the launch of WGEM-TV, the area's NBC affiliate. The building containing the ground floor studios of the WGEM stations was also the former home of the Tremont Hotel, and Quincy Media continues to operate it as the New Tremont Apartments, containing both long-term and extended stay accommodations.\nIn 1969, QNI and six other newspaper entities formed American Newspapers Inc., which bought The New Jersey Herald in Newton, New Jersey, converting the semi-weekly to a daily and Sunday publication in 1970. QNI acquired controlling interest in American Newspapers in 1980 and became sole owner in 1986.\nBeginning in the 1970s, QNI began a major expansion into television. WSJV in Elkhart, Indiana (serving South Bend) was acquired in 1974; KROC-TV (renamed KTTC) in Rochester, Minnesota in 1976; WHIS-TV (renamed WVVA) in Bluefield, West Virginia in 1979; KTIV in Sioux City, Iowa in 1989; and WREX-TV in Rockford in 1995. All of the stations were also NBC affiliates at their acquisitions except for WSJV and WREX, which were ABC affiliates; however, in 1995, WSJV dropped ABC for Fox, and soon thereafter WREX joined NBC. Also in 1995, The Merchant, a weekly shopper in Quincy was purchased by the company.\nIn June 2001, QNI purchased from Shockley Communications five ABC affiliates in Wisconsin: WKOW-TV in Madison, WAOW-TV in Wausau; WYOW in Eagle River (a satellite of WAOW); WXOW-TV in La Crosse; and WQOW-TV in Eau Claire (a semi-satellite of WXOW). Also purchased from SCC at the time was ProVideo of Wisconsin, Inc. consisting of a component digital online suite and a fully integrated non-linear online suite in Madison, Wisconsin. Concurrent with the Shockley purchase, KTTC entered into a shared services agreement with KXLT-TV, the Fox affiliate in Rochester, Minnesota. KTTC provides all services for KXLT excluding sales, traffic, and programming.\n\nOn July 1, 2006, QNI purchased KWWL, the NBC affiliate in Waterloo, Iowa, from Raycom Media. In February 2009, QNI purchased Crandon, Wisconsin's WBIJ from the widow of the station's founder, with the intention to operate the station as a satellite station of WAOW; QNI subsequently renamed the station WMOW to conform with its other Wisconsin properties.\nOn February 11, 2014, Quincy announced plans to acquire a number of small and mid-market stations from Granite Broadcasting, including WEEK-TV in Peoria, KBJR-TV in Superior, Wisconsin, KRII in Chisholm, Minnesota (a satellite of KBJR), and WBNG-TV in Binghamton, New York (the company's first CBS affiliate; WEEK and KBJR/KRII are NBC affiliates). As part of the deal, Quincy originally planned to purchase WPTA, the ABC affiliate in Fort Wayne, Indiana, from Malara Broadcast Group, and provide services to ABC affiliate WHOI and MyNetworkTV affiliate WAOE in Peoria, NBC affiliate WISE-TV in Fort Wayne, and CBS affiliate KDLH in Duluth, Minnesota. In November 2014, the deal was reworked so that Quincy would acquire WISE and provide services to WPTA, retaining the arrangement between the stations established by Granite. In July 2015, the deal was reworked yet again; Quincy would, yet again, acquire WPTA instead of WISE, and Malara's stations would be acquired by SagamoreHill Broadcasting. Quincy also proposed to wind down its shared services agreements with WISE and KDLH within nine months of the sale's completion: both stations would move their existing network affiliations to WPTA and KBJR, and become independently-operated stations airing The CW. On September 15, 2015, the FCC approved the deal.In 2015, the company's flagship title dropped Quincy from its masthead and became simply the Herald-Whig. In 2016, the Herald-Whig and Quincy Media applied for a demolition permit for the historic Morgan-Wells House in Quincy for expansion of their offices. The NRHP-listed local landmark was the home of notable Quincy residents and institutions for over a century, now demolished.In January 2016, the company changed its name to Quincy Media.On May 21, 2018, it was announced that Quincy Media would acquire KDLH outright for $792,557 and WISE for $952,884. While the FCC normally prohibits one company from owning two television licenses in the same market when both are among the top four rated stations, Quincy submitted a filing saying that during the November 2017 \"sweeps\" period KBJR-TV was the top ranked station while KDLH placed fifth, and that WPTA was the second ranked station while WISE-TV placed fifth. The sale was completed on August 1.On August 29, 2018, Quincy Media's stations were pulled from Dish Network after failing to reach a new retransmission fee agreement. On October 12, Quincy Media reached a new agreement with Dish Network to continue carrying Quincy Media stations.On October 29, 2018, Quincy announced it would be acquiring KVOA in Tucson, Arizona, from Cordillera Communications for $70 million as a side deal of the latter company's acquisition by the E.

On April 29, it was announced that Allen Media Group will purchase 10 Quincy stations not being acquired by Gray Television for $380 million. The newspapers were sold to another family-owned publishing company, Phillips Media Group of Harrison, Arkansas, in a separate transaction. The transaction was completed on August 2.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "159_65563", "text": "The corporation was formed in Quincy on June 1, 1926, as Quincy Newspapers after the merger of the Quincy Herald, direct descendant of the Illinois Bounty Land Register first published in Quincy in 1835, and the Quincy Whig-Journal, descendant of the Quincy Whig founded in 1838. The two papers were combined to form a single daily paper, the Quincy Herald-Whig.The Herald was purchased in September 1891 by three men from Rockford, Charles L. Miller, Hedley John Eaton and Edmund Botsford. Miller had earlier founded the Rockford Daily Register, that city's oldest newspaper. Subsequently, Miller brought to the Herald his brother-in-law and nephew, respectively, Aaron Burr Oakley and Ray M. Oakley, the first two generations of the Oakleys in the newspaper business in Quincy. Miller spent four years in Quincy, returning to Rockford in 1896 to join Harry M. Johnson in ownership of the Rockford Republic. He retired as editor of the Republic in 1913 and died in 1921. Hedley Eaton retired in 1913 and died in 1936. Eaton's son John Dewitt Eaton stayed with the paper as Advertising Manager until his retirement in 1955.\nTwo brothers from Decatur, Frank M. Lindsay, Sr. and Arthur O. Lindsay, Sr. bought the Quincy Whig in 1915, with Arthur Lindsay taking up residence in Quincy as president and manager. Frank Lindsay remained in Decatur with the Decatur Herald and formed an association with another Illinois newspaper family, the Schaubs. In 1920, the Lindsays consolidated the Whig and The Quincy Journal, founded in 1883.\nQNI entered broadcasting in 1947, the year it started Quincy's first commercial FM station, WQDI. The following year QNI purchased Quincy Broadcasting Co. to operate WGEM, the city's second AM station. WQDI became WGEM-FM in 1953.\n\nQuincy Broadcasting produced the Quincy region's first television broadcast on September 4, 1953, with the launch of WGEM-TV, the area's NBC affiliate. The building containing the ground floor studios of the WGEM stations was also the former home of the Tremont Hotel, and Quincy Media continues to operate it as the New Tremont Apartments, containing both long-term and extended stay accommodations.\nIn 1969, QNI and six other newspaper entities formed American Newspapers Inc., which bought The New Jersey Herald in Newton, New Jersey, converting the semi-weekly to a daily and Sunday publication in 1970. QNI acquired controlling interest in American Newspapers in 1980 and became sole owner in 1986.\nBeginning in the 1970s, QNI began a major expansion into television. WSJV in Elkhart, Indiana (serving South Bend) was acquired in 1974; KROC-TV (renamed KTTC) in Rochester, Minnesota in 1976; WHIS-TV (renamed WVVA) in Bluefield, West Virginia in 1979; KTIV in Sioux City, Iowa in 1989; and WREX-TV in Rockford in 1995. All of the stations were also NBC affiliates at their acquisitions except for WSJV and WREX, which were ABC affiliates; however, in 1995, WSJV dropped ABC for Fox, and soon thereafter WREX joined NBC. Also in 1995, The Merchant, a weekly shopper in Quincy was purchased by the company.\nIn June 2001, QNI purchased from Shockley Communications five ABC affiliates in Wisconsin: WKOW-TV in Madison, WAOW-TV in Wausau; WYOW in Eagle River (a satellite of WAOW); WXOW-TV in La Crosse; and WQOW-TV in Eau Claire (a semi-satellite of WXOW). Also purchased from SCC at the time was ProVideo of Wisconsin, Inc. consisting of a component digital online suite and a fully integrated non-linear online suite in Madison, Wisconsin. Concurrent with the Shockley purchase, KTTC entered into a shared services agreement with KXLT-TV, the Fox affiliate in Rochester, Minnesota. KTTC provides all services for KXLT excluding sales, traffic, and programming.\n\nOn July 1, 2006, QNI purchased KWWL, the NBC affiliate in Waterloo, Iowa, from Raycom Media. In February 2009, QNI purchased Crandon, Wisconsin's WBIJ from the widow of the station's founder, with the intention to operate the station as a satellite station of WAOW; QNI subsequently renamed the station WMOW to conform with its other Wisconsin properties.\nOn February 11, 2014, Quincy announced plans to acquire a number of small and mid-market stations from Granite Broadcasting, including WEEK-TV in Peoria, KBJR-TV in Superior, Wisconsin, KRII in Chisholm, Minnesota (a satellite of KBJR), and WBNG-TV in Binghamton, New York (the company's first CBS affiliate; WEEK and KBJR/KRII are NBC affiliates). As part of the deal, Quincy originally planned to purchase WPTA, the ABC affiliate in Fort Wayne, Indiana, from Malara Broadcast Group, and provide services to ABC affiliate WHOI and MyNetworkTV affiliate WAOE in Peoria, NBC affiliate WISE-TV in Fort Wayne, and CBS affiliate KDLH in Duluth, Minnesota. In November 2014, the deal was reworked so that Quincy would acquire WISE and provide services to WPTA, retaining the arrangement between the stations established by Granite. In July 2015, the deal was reworked yet again; Quincy would, yet again, acquire WPTA instead of WISE, and Malara's stations would be acquired by SagamoreHill Broadcasting. Quincy also proposed to wind down its shared services agreements with WISE and KDLH within nine months of the sale's completion: both stations would move their existing network affiliations to WPTA and KBJR, and become independently-operated stations airing The CW. On September 15, 2015, the FCC approved the deal.In 2015, the company's flagship title dropped Quincy from its masthead and became simply the Herald-Whig. In 2016, the Herald-Whig and Quincy Media applied for a demolition permit for the historic Morgan-Wells House in Quincy for expansion of their offices. The NRHP-listed local landmark was the home of notable Quincy residents and institutions for over a century, now demolished.In January 2016, the company changed its name to Quincy Media.On May 21, 2018, it was announced that Quincy Media would acquire KDLH outright for $792,557 and WISE for $952,884. While the FCC normally prohibits one company from owning two television licenses in the same market when both are among the top four rated stations, Quincy submitted a filing saying that during the November 2017 \"sweeps\" period KBJR-TV was the top ranked station while KDLH placed fifth, and that WPTA was the second ranked station while WISE-TV placed fifth. The sale was completed on August 1.On August 29, 2018, Quincy Media's stations were pulled from Dish Network after failing to reach a new retransmission fee agreement. On October 12, Quincy Media reached a new agreement with Dish Network to continue carrying Quincy Media stations.On October 29, 2018, Quincy announced it would be acquiring KVOA in Tucson, Arizona, from Cordillera Communications for $70 million as a side deal of the latter company's acquisition by the E. W. Scripps Company. Two days later, on October 31, Quincy announced that it would be acquiring WSIL-TV in Harrisburg, Illinois and KPOB, Poplar Bluff, MO, from Mel Wheeler, Inc. for $24.5 million.On May 10, 2019, Quincy announced it would purchase the Hannibal Courier-Post from GateHouse Media, marking its first daily newspaper expansion since 1969.

Since 2006, KUKA Systems is operating its own body shell factory in Toledo, Ohio, and produces the bodywork for the Jeep Wrangler by Chrysler.\nIn the course of internationalisation and expansion of business units and technologies such as reshaping, tooling, bonding, sealing, etc., KUKA Schweissanlagen GmbH became KUKA Systems GmbH in 2007. In 2010, KUKA presented a newly developed standardised cell concept for welding machines, KUKA flexibleCUBE.\nIn the automation sector, KUKA Systems offers standard and customised products for industrial production automation; joining technologies and component handling are amongst their activity. The technologies are tested and the production processes are fully optimised prior to the development. In addition, KUKA Systems offers engineering and individual counselling.In June 2016, Midea Group offered to buy Kuka for about \u20ac4.5 billion ($5 billion).

The company is known for producing low-budget, direct-to-video films, in particular mockbusters, which capitalize on the popularity of major studio films with similar titles and premises. The Asylum's business model revolves around producing as many low-budget films as quickly as possible, and earn around $150,000 to $250,000 in profit. Since the company produces dozens of films every year, this model generates millions of dollars, and the company claims to have never lost money on a film. The Asylum spends around 4-6 months making a film, and since the company is not affiliated with any industry guilds other than SAG-AFTRA, this means their employees will sometimes work upwards of 22 hours a day.\nInitially founded as a distribution company for low-budget drama films, The Asylum switched to in-house productions in the mid-2000s due to competition from larger studios like Lionsgate Films. In 2005, The Asylum released the film H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds the day before Steven Spielberg film War of the Worlds. Blockbuster ordered 100,000 copies, which inspired The Asylum to focus on mockbusters. This led to a partnership with the television channel Syfy, and with the rise of video on demand (VOD) services in the early 2010s, partnerships with Pluto TV and Tubi. The Asylum's greatest success came in 2013 with the film Sharknado, which is about a waterspout that lifts sharks out of the ocean and drops them over Los Angeles. The over-the-top premise went viral, and led to the creation of the Sharknado franchise. In response to the popularity of Sharknado, Syfy commissioned The Asylum to produce a zombie television series called Z Nation, which ran for five seasons.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "159_65797", "text": "The Asylum's business model revolves around producing as many low-budget films as quickly as possible.

Despite the similar titles, the scripts for Asylum mockbuster films often have little to nothing to do with the larger film they are based on. Rolf Potts of The New York Times noted that although The Asylum film Transmorphers was a clear imitation of Transformers, Transmorphers only occasionally features shape-shifting robots and devotes more time to a lesbian subplot.

Following Riot Games' first world championship event in 2011, a small affair at a conference in Sweden, the company decided to turn their tournaments into professional sports-like events. It invested in broadcasting equipment, hired sports programming producers, and trained pro gamers to be \"TV-ready\".

On May 10, 2010, Riot Games announced that they would take over distribution and operation of their game in Europe; to do so, Riot Games relocated their European headquarters in Brighton to new offices in Dublin. In February 2011, Tencent invested $400 million for a 93 percent stake in Riot Games. Tencent bought the remaining 7 percent on December 16, 2015; the price was not disclosed.In 2012, in response to toxicity and harassment in League of Legends, Riot Games launched a \"player behavior team\" of psychologists to combat harassment on its platform. Riot Games' tactics to address issues on League of Legends, which included an opt-in chat function between opposing players, informing banned players of the reasoning behind the ban, as well as creating a tribunal of players to weigh in on bans, resulted in a 30 percent drop in reported harassment behavior. The efficacy of their results has been questioned by players and the gaming press. By 2013, League of Legends was the most-played multiplayer PC game in the world. By 2016, Inc. reported the game had over 100 million monthly players.Riot Games relocated to a new building on a 20-acre (8 hectare) campus in western Los Angeles in 2015. In March 2016, Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment, another developer who was working on Rising Thunder and Stonehearth at the time. Rising Thunder was effectively canceled following the acquisition, with the game's team allocated to a new project. On October 13, 2017, Beck and Merrill announced that they were returning their focus to developing games, aiming to create new experiences for video game and esports players. Beck and Merrill handed over the day-to-day operations and overall management of the League of Legends team to three longtime employees: Dylan Jadeja, Scott Gelb, and Nicolo Laurent, who previously served as chief financial officer (CFO), chief technology officer (CTO) and president, respectively. Subsequently, Gelb and Laurent assumed roles as chief operating officer (COO) and chief executive officer (CEO), respectively, while Beck and Merrill became the Riot Games' chairmen. As of May 2018, Riot Games employed 2,500 people, operating 24 offices around the world.In October 2019, Riot Games announced several new games: a version of League of Legends for mobile devices and consoles called League of Legends: Wild Rift, a standalone mobile version of the Teamfight Tactics mode from League of Legends, and the digital collectible card game titled Legends of Runeterra, with all three scheduled for a 2020 release. The company also teased further games \u2014 Project A, a tactical shooter; Project L, a fighting game with League of Legends characters; and Project F, a multiplayer game set in Runeterra \u2013 that were not detailed outside of genre descriptions and brief gameplay clips. Project A was later revealed to be Valorant, which entered closed beta on April 7, 2020 and was officially released on June 2, 2020.\nIn December 2019, Riot Games announced Riot Forge, a publishing label headed by Leanne Loombe. The label partners with smaller game development studios for the creation of League of Legends games, with some games of this type already being in development. Two titles from Riot Forge were announced at The Game Awards 2019: Ruined King: A League of Legends Story by Airship Syndicate, and Convergence: A League of Legends Story by Double Stallion Games. Another division, Riot Tabletop, was announced in January 2020, to producing tabletop games; the first was Tellstones: King's Gambit, released in 2020.Riot acquired Hypixel Studios in April 2020, which they had been investing in over the previous eighteen months to help them publish Hytale, a voxel-based sandbox game. Also in April, Riot announced plans to establish a Singapore office later that year. Riot Games Singapore is to support Riot's existing titles and will have a major focus on developing the company's newer titles. Jason Bunge was hired as Riot Games' chief marketing officer in October 2020. In October 2021, the company bought Kanga, a services firm involved in \"fan hubs\", merchandising, and content aggregation.Riot Games collaborated with French animation studio Fortiche to release an animated series, Arcane. The series was released worldwide in November 2021 on Netflix, and by parent company Tencent in China, and received a favorable critical reception. In March 2022, Riot Games announced that it had invested in Fortiche and, as a result, its chief content officer Brian Wright and director of corporate development Brendan Mulligan were joining Fortiche's board of directors. That same month, Riot also hired executives from Netflix, Paramount, and HBO Max to head development of film, TV, and music endeavors built around the company's intellectual property.In October 2022, Riot acquired Wargaming Sydney\u2014a subsidiary of Cyprus-based Wargaming that had originally developed the MMO middleware BigWorld\u2014for an undisclosed amount, and renamed it Riot Sydney. The acquisition excludes rights to the BigWorld technology itself, as well as its publishing arm.In January 2023, Riot Games cut 46 employees in a round of layoffs. In the same month, it suffered a cyberattack that stole source code for League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, and an anti-cheat platform. The hackers in question put the stolen data up for sale on the dark web for US$700,000. In 2023, several games under the Riot Forge label were released, including The Mageseeker by Digital Sun, and Song of Nunu by Tequila Works.In September 2023, Dylan Jadeja became company CEO.Riot announced in January 2024 that it would be laying off 530 employees, or about 11% of its workforce, as well as sunsetting the Riot Forge effort as well as its planned Twitch competitor, Riot Esports Network (REN). Jadeja stated the rationale for the layoffs: \"A decision like this has a massive impact on people's lives and on the culture of Riot. We're not doing this to appease shareholders or to hit some quarterly earnings number \u2013 we've made this decision because it's a necessity. It's what we need to do in order to maintain a long-term focus for players.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "159_66226", "text": "Riot Games operates esports leagues worldwide. This includes the League of Legends Championship Series, comprising leagues in North America and Europe. In total, there are more than 100 teams in Riot Games' 12 regional leagues around the world. Teams compete over the course of a season separated into two seasonal splits. Teams earn championship points to qualify for two major international competitions: the Mid-Season Invitational and the League of Legends World Championship. Riot Games' World Championship is the annual professional tournament at the conclusion of each season.During 2010 and 2011, the Riot Games team developed new content for League of Legends; it was during this time that the company realized that people also liked to watch the game being played. As a result, Riot Games established its own League of Legends esports leagues which produce weekly broadcasts and create a professional game schedule. Following Riot Games' first world championship event in 2011, a small affair at a conference in Sweden, the company decided to turn their tournaments into professional sports-like events. It invested in broadcasting equipment, hired sports programming producers, and trained pro gamers to be \"TV-ready\". In 2012, Riot Games held its tournament at University of Southern California's Galen Center, offering $1 million in prize money. Riot Games has since held tournaments in Berlin, Seoul, Madison Square Garden in New York City, and the Staples Center in Los Angeles.The company sells corporate sponsorships, merchandise, and streaming rights for its esports league. In 2015, investors bought stakes in teams and began building their own squads. Among the team owners in Riot Games' leagues are the owners of the Washington Wizards, Cleveland Cavaliers, Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Dodgers, AOL co-founder Steve Case, and life coach Tony Robbins. Inc. cited the growth of the leagues and high-profile ownership as part of its reasoning for making Riot Games its 2016 Company of the Year. Following debates over whether pro players and coaches should have a greater share of Riot Games' esports revenue and concerns raised about the company making in-game changes prior to matches, the company issued an open letter in 2016 promising higher revenue shares and more collaboration with professional teams. In 2017, Riot Games held the League of Legends World Championship in China, with the finals taking place in Beijing. The same year, the company announced it would franchise its ten-team North American League of Legends Championship Series, which cost at least $10 million to enter.In November 2020, Riot Games announced the first Valorant Champions Tour, the global competitive tournament for Valorant.In 2021, Riot began building out three new \"remote broadcast centers\" in Asia, North America (Seattle), and Europe (Dublin), as part of an effort to improve the scale of its esports productions using a centralized production model with regional hubs. The facilities would be capable of both on-site productions, and allowing regional productions to connect to the facilities' datacenters and use their infrastructure as part of remote productions. The three locations were chosen as their time zones are each eight hours apart, allowing them to \"work a full shift and then shut down and throw control for the next productions to the next facility.\" The first RBC in Dublin, Ireland, opened in July 2022, in a building formerly housed by the nightclub The Wright Venue in Swords; it has an IP-based infrastructure, six studios, and preserves the nightclub's disco ball (which had been promoted as the largest in Europe).As part of their buildout of the LoL series, Riot partnered with the FTX cryptocurrency exchange in August 2021 for a seven-year deal.

The founding meeting was held in April 1990 in Helsinki, following the publishing of the April Declaration, which stated the party's ideals.\nThe party's history has been characterised by internal disputes and bickering, as it was formed via people with very different views on society. There have been several defections from the Left Alliance to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the newly formed Communist Party of Finland. In 2005, the party's former secretary and Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions's assistant head Matti Viialainen formed a group to promote a merger between the two largest Finnish left-wing political parties, the Left Alliance and the SDP. This caused an outrage within the Left Alliance, and Viialainen was condemned for wanting to break up the party. Viialainen subsequently left the party and ran for parliament on the SDP ticket in 2007.In 2006, the party's leader Suvi-Anne Siimes announced her resignation from the post and the party as a result of long-standing feuds with the leftist section of the party. On 13 May 2006, Martti Korhonen was elected as the new party leader. He was followed by Paavo Arhinm\u00e4ki in June 2009, following the party's bad performance in the 2009 EU parliamentary election, in which the party lost its only seat.\nIn the 2011 election, the party won 14 seats and became a partner in the six-party \u201drainbow\u201d coalition cabinet led by Jyrki Katainen. The decision to join the government created a split in the party, leading to the expulsion of two MPs from the parliamentary group. In 2014, the Left Alliance left the cabinet over a dispute on a package of spending cuts and tax hikes. In 2014 European Parliament election, the party regained their lost seat.\nIn the 2015 parliamentary election, the party received 211,615 votes, 7.1% of the total, and won 12 seats in the parliament. In April 2016, Arhinm\u00e4ki announced that he wouldn't seek another term as the party leader. On 11 June 2016, Arhinm\u00e4ki was succeeded by Li Andersson.

The car had an eight-in-line engine with a displacement of no less than 12,760 cc, delivering 80 bhp (60 kW) at 1300 rpm. The event was a total failure for the Dufaux brothers as their car with the number 7 not even could start because of a broken wheel. This car still exists and is permanently exhibited at the Mus\u00e9e Nationale de l'automobile (Collection Schlumpf / Cit\u00e9 de l'Automobile) in Mulhouse (France). As Frenchman L\u00e9on Th\u00e9ry on Richard-Brasier won the race, France had to organize the cup for 1905.Later, the brothers won a race at Geneva over a distance of one kilometer at an average speed of 72 mph (116 km/h).\nAt a second race in Paris, the brothers came in second place. The car had actually been driven from Switzerland to Paris in less than 10 hours.\nThe official Gordon Bennett homepage mentions an 80 HP Dufaux with a straight eight-cylinder engine entering the 1905 event. The race was held in the Auvergne near Paris. As the result list neither mentions the Dufaux brother nor their car, it is safe to conclude that they didn't make it to the start. Again, L\u00e9on Th\u00e9ry on Richard-Brasier won the cup. This was the last Gordon Bennett cup for automobiles.Another model built by the brothers was given a monstrous four-cylinder engine with 26,400 cc. This big engine gave more than 150 bhp (110 kW). Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dufaux broke with this car the world record on 13 November 1905 at a speed of 98 mph (158 km/h) . He completed a kilometer in just 23 seconds.In 1906, more cars were built. Most of them had a smaller four-cylinder engine. An eight-cylinder with 120 bhp (89 kW) was also built. In a hill climb in Marchairuz in 1906, four Dufaux models took place in the starting line. Two of them were eight-cylinders with 12,760 cc and 14,449 cc, respectively, and one a more modern four-cylinder with 4,400 cc.\nUnfortunately, manufacturing of race cars became too expensive, so they ceased production in 1907.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region, initially with the East Indies (the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia), and later with East Asia. The company gained control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent and colonised parts of Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. At its peak, the company was the largest corporation in the world by various measures and had its own armed forces in the form of the company's three presidency armies, totalling about 260,000 soldiers, twice the size of the British army at the time.Originally chartered as the \"Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies\", the company rose to account for half of the world's trade during the mid-1700s and early 1800s, particularly in basic commodities including cotton, silk, indigo dye, sugar, salt, spices, saltpetre, tea, and later, opium. The company also initiated the beginnings of the British Empire in India.The company eventually came to rule large areas of India, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions. Company-ruled areas in India gradually expanded after the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and by 1858 most of modern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh was either ruled by the company or princely states closely tied to it by treaty. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown assuming direct control of India in the form of the new British Raj.\nThe company subsequently experienced recurring problems with its finances, despite frequent government intervention. The company was dissolved in 1874 under the terms of the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act enacted one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete.

Elector Frederick William developed it into a viable standing army, while King Frederick William I of Prussia dramatically increased its size and improved its doctrines. King Frederick the Great, a formidable battle commander, led the disciplined Prussian troops to victory during the 18th-century Silesian Wars and greatly increased the prestige of the Kingdom of Prussia.\nThe Prussian army had become outdated and under-resourced by the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars, and France defeated Prussia in the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806. However, under the leadership of Gerhard von Scharnhorst, Prussian reformers began modernizing the Prussian Army, which contributed greatly to the defeat of Napoleon during the War of the Sixth Coalition. Conservatives halted some of the reforms, however, and the Prussian Army subsequently became a bulwark of the conservative Prussian government.\nIn the 19th century, the Prussian Army fought successful wars against Denmark, Austria, and France, allowing Prussia to unify Germany, establishing the German Empire in 1871.

His friend, Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, served as the royal drill sergeant for the Prussian Army. Leopold introduced the iron ramrod, increasing Prussian firepower, and the slow march, or goose-step. He also vastly increased the role of music in the Army, dedicating a large number of musician-troops, especially drummers and fifers, to use music for increasing morale in battle. The usefulness of music in battles was first recognized in the Thirty Years' War by the Brandenburger and Swedish armies. The new king trained and drilled the army relentlessly, focusing on their flintlock muskets' firing speed and formation maneuverability. The changes gave the army flexibility, precision, and a rate of fire that was mostly unequalled for that period.

The camera used standard 828 rollfilm packaged in a proprietary snap-in cartridge which had to be returned to the company for processing. It was aimed mainly at women, marketed as a \"goof-proof\" alternative to traditional cameras.Although innovative, the Fotron was also extremely expensive, unwieldy, and reportedly suffered from poor optical quality. Introduced at a list price of $139.95, by 1971 the camera was selling for $520 (equivalent to $3,912 in 2023), plus $3.98 per 10-exposure roll for film and processing (equivalent to $30 in 2023). Despite this, Traid claimed the cameras were sold at a loss and only the film processing operation was able to turn a profit.

This season, the Vladimir players played two matches with Premier League clubs: in the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup with FC Zenit (0:2) and in a friendly game with FC Spartak Moscow (0:3). In 2010, Torpedo won the tournament in the West zone of the Second Division and earned the right to participate in the First Division.\nDuring the first 11 rounds of the 2011/12 season, five coaches of Torpedo rivals were dismissed in direct or indirect connection with the games with the club from Vladimir. In this regard, Evgeny Durnev was called \"the executioner of the FNL coaching workshop\". In July 2011, Torpedo, having beaten Spartak-Nalchik, reached the 1/8 finals of the Russian Cup, where they lost to Terek Grozny. Torpedo finished the first round of the FNL championship in 10th place, but after the 32nd round, having a series of seven matches without victories in the liabilities, the club fell into the \"relegation zone\". On 18 October 2011, Evgeny Durnev submitted his resignation, and his assistant Alexander Akimov was appointed acting head coach. After the final match of the first stage, in which Torpedo defeated Torpedo Moscow, Akimov was approved as head coach. At the second stage of the FNL championship, they significantly improved their standings and, after defeating Baltika in the penultimate round, secured a place in the FNL for the next year.\nOn 5 July 2012, the Torpedo management announced that there were no financial opportunities to participate in the FNL-2012/13 and that the club was deprived of its professional status. In 2012, Torpedo played in the Golden Ring zone of the Russian Championship among amateur clubs. In May 2013, Torpedo passed the certification in the PFL and received the right to play in the Second Division in the 2013/14 season.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "159_66508", "text": "As of 27 March 2024, according to the official Second League website.\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Godfrey secured financial backing from a U.S. private equity firm, the Manhattan-based hedge fund GoldenTree Asset Management\u2014which owns 35 per cent\u2014as well as IJNR Investment Trust, Nyppex and  other investors. The group completed a $1.1 billion transaction to acquire the chain from Canwest on July 13, 2010.On October 6, 2014, Postmedia's CEO Godfrey announced a deal to acquire the English-language operations of Sun Media. The purchase received regulatory approval from the federal Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015, even though the company manages competitive papers in several Canadian cities; while the Sun Media chain owns numerous other papers, four of its five Sun-branded tabloids operate in markets where Postmedia already publishes a broadsheet competitor. Board chair Rod Phillips has cited the Vancouver market, in which the two main daily newspapers, the Vancouver Sun and The Province, have had common ownership for over 30 years, as evidence that the deal would not be anticompetitive. The purchase did not include Sun Media's now-defunct Sun News Network. The acquisition was approved by the Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015, and closed on April 13.In 2016, the company sought to restructure its compensation plans and reduce spending by as much as 20%, after reporting a net loss of $99.4 million, or 35 cents per diluted share, in the fourth-quarter ended Aug 31, compared with a $54.1 million net loss, or 19 cents per diluted share, in the same period a year earlier.

Along with the universities of St Andrews, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, the university was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century.\nThe university as it is currently constituted was formed in 1860 by a merger between King's College and Marischal College, a second university founded in 1593 as a Protestant alternative to the former. The university's iconic buildings act as symbols of wider Aberdeen, particularly Marischal College in the city centre and the crown steeple of King's College in Old Aberdeen. There are two campuses; the predominantly utilised King's College campus dominates the section of the city known as Old Aberdeen, which is approximately two miles north of the city centre. Although the original site of the university's foundation, most academic buildings apart from the King's College Chapel and Quadrangle were constructed in the 20th century during a period of significant expansion. The university's Foresterhill campus is next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and houses the School of Medicine and Dentistry as well as the School of Medical Sciences.

Since Kocaeli is a near neighbor of Istanbul, many of its students come from Istanbul.\nThe university has established a department of international relations that monitors Bologna developments closely and oversees KOU's participation in the Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci student mobility schemes. With membership in the European University Association, KOU is aiming for greater international recognition of its academic work.\nThe university, while focusing on technical and engineering subjects, offers an extensive selection of courses in social sciences and arts as well.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Eber Brock Ward, a wealthy steamboat owner from Detroit, Michigan, who organized the Detroit Copper Mining Co with Miles Joy as manager.  Ward died January 2, 1875, in Detroit before substantial work began.  His managers did patent the richest claims, the Arizona Central, Copper Mountain, Montezuma, and Yankee.\nIn the late 1870s William Church, a mine speculator from Denver, Colorado, negotiated the purchase of the company stock.  Church became the true father of the camp.  . With a loan from the partners in Phelps, Dodge, during 1882 he erected furnaces, opened the mines, and began shipping copper east. As a reflection of frontier conditions of the times, he was attacked by Apaches at his smelter in 1882, and twice robbed at gunpoint in his office during the early 1880s.  On the advice of Dr. James Douglas (businessman), consultant for Phelps Dodge, the smelter was relocated from the San Francisco River to the mines. The first concentrator was built and a \"baby\" gauge railroad connected the DCC mines with the transport system of the neighboring Arizona Copper Company, which connected to the transcontinental Southern Pacific Railroad. Church had made his DCC into one of the early, respectable copper operations in the territory. In 1897, he sold his 55% interests in the DCC to Phelps Dodge for a reported $800,000, retired to his stone mansion in Denver's capitol hill neighborhood, and earned a reputation as philanthropist and real estate baron.James Douglas became president and general manager of the operation for Phelps Dodge, which increased the DCC capital stock from $500,000 to one million dollars, and over the next four years greatly expanded DCC operations with a new rail connection, concentrator, and improved, rebuilt smelter. Metallurgist and Douglas protege, Dr. L.D. Ricketts designed the 600 ton Yankee concentrator, one of the most innovative of the time, and the first of many modern, ever enlarging plants built in the district (steel beams with iron sheeting, Wilfley tables, vanners and jigs for gravity concentration, which could work ores under 3% copper). The Morenci Southern narrow gauge railroad, completed in 1901, connected the mines via five loops over itself in the 18 miles of rails down the mountainside to a junction with the New Mexico & Arizona line. A network of \"baby\" gauge railroad tracks connected the mine works, plants, and the Morenci Southern. Under Dr. Douglas, the smelter was rebuilt with five blast furnaces and Bessemer converters which produced a purer copper for the market. At its peak, Detroit Copper Co. consisted of 145 mining claims at Morenci.Detroit Copper Co. founded the town of Morenci (originally named Joy's camp after Ward's first local manager) to supply housing and services to workers employed by the company. After a devastating fire in 1897, Morenci was relocated three quarters of a mile down the canyon. DCC managers organized the Morenci Improvement Company to help rebuild the town and construct better housing. In time, DCC or the improvement company owned a large store, a hotel, and considerable amounts of additional property in the town of Morenci. DCC also funded a free public library, gymnasium and improved schools for workers and their families. At the beginning of the twentieth century the town of Morenci had distinctive southwestern architecture, with Spanish mission style and rustic stone buildings used by the company around a central camp plaza. (The original \"Hell's Half Acre\" of saloons and brothels were re-built away from the plaza). DCC also established a water pumping plant on the San Francisco River seven miles away. The nearby smelter town of Clifton was settled to provide additional housing, and eventually eclipsed the camp becoming Greenlee county seat.The company employed mostly Mexican miners, who were paid about half what Caucasian miners earned. During the Church era, Mexican miners were paid with company script, or paper \"boletas, which could only be spent at the company store, a base for contention between miners and the company. The boleta system was eased out after the DCC was acquired by Phelps Dodge. As with many mines in Arizona and New Mexico at the time, the Detroit Copper Co. saw several waves of labor union organizing as well as strikes from 1900 onward. DCC used labor spies to infiltrate nascent unions and stop organizing campaigns.A significant problem in early copper camps were disputes over ownership of ore bodies based on the 1872 Mining Law's \"rule of the apex.\" This was defined where the company which owned the apex (or outcrop) of an ore body could mine ore across mine claim boundaries following vein \"dips, spurs, and angles\u201d. Church was able to avoid a potential lawsuit with neighboring claim holders by agreeing to ignore the rule of the apex and use British common law, whereby the companies extracted ore from only within their claim boundaries. In May 1882, Church's company agreed to co-develop the \"Detroit lode\" with the Longfellow Copper Mining Company (later purchased by the Arizona Copper Company). Although federal and state law provided that the company which accessed the lode had the right to develop the entire deposit, Detroit Copper lacked the capital to do so and agreed to permit Longfellow Copper to mine the lode as well, up to their agreed claim boundaries. This shift away from the rule of the apex to common law was followed later in other Arizona copper districts, most notably at Bisbee, Arizona.After the 1917 reorganization of the Phelps Dodge & Co holding company into the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the Detroit Copper Company ceased to exist. The operation was then known as \"Phelps Dodge Corporation, Morenci Branch.\" In 1921, Phelps Dodge acquired the mines of the adjacent Arizona Copper Company, Ltd, creating a world class copper operation, which is now one of the largest copper producers in the United States.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "159_66862", "text": "Prospectors had searched this mineralized Clifton-Morenci region for a decade before staking claims to what would become the central holdings of Capt.

In 1897, he sold his 55% interests in the DCC to Phelps Dodge for a reported $800,000, retired to his stone mansion in Denver's capitol hill neighborhood, and earned a reputation as philanthropist and real estate baron.James Douglas became president and general manager of the operation for Phelps Dodge, which increased the DCC capital stock from $500,000 to one million dollars, and over the next four years greatly expanded DCC operations with a new rail connection, concentrator, and improved, rebuilt smelter. Metallurgist and Douglas protege, Dr. L.D. Ricketts designed the 600 ton Yankee concentrator, one of the most innovative of the time, and the first of many modern, ever enlarging plants built in the district (steel beams with iron sheeting, Wilfley tables, vanners and jigs for gravity concentration, which could work ores under 3% copper). The Morenci Southern narrow gauge railroad, completed in 1901, connected the mines via five loops over itself in the 18 miles of rails down the mountainside to a junction with the New Mexico & Arizona line. A network of \"baby\" gauge railroad tracks connected the mine works, plants, and the Morenci Southern. Under Dr. Douglas, the smelter was rebuilt with five blast furnaces and Bessemer converters which produced a purer copper for the market. At its peak, Detroit Copper Co. consisted of 145 mining claims at Morenci.Detroit Copper Co. founded the town of Morenci (originally named Joy's camp after Ward's first local manager) to supply housing and services to workers employed by the company. After a devastating fire in 1897, Morenci was relocated three quarters of a mile down the canyon. DCC managers organized the Morenci Improvement Company to help rebuild the town and construct better housing. In time, DCC or the improvement company owned a large store, a hotel, and considerable amounts of additional property in the town of Morenci. DCC also funded a free public library, gymnasium and improved schools for workers and their families. At the beginning of the twentieth century the town of Morenci had distinctive southwestern architecture, with Spanish mission style and rustic stone buildings used by the company around a central camp plaza. (The original \"Hell's Half Acre\" of saloons and brothels were re-built away from the plaza). DCC also established a water pumping plant on the San Francisco River seven miles away. The nearby smelter town of Clifton was settled to provide additional housing, and eventually eclipsed the camp becoming Greenlee county seat.The company employed mostly Mexican miners, who were paid about half what Caucasian miners earned. During the Church era, Mexican miners were paid with company script, or paper \"boletas, which could only be spent at the company store, a base for contention between miners and the company. The boleta system was eased out after the DCC was acquired by Phelps Dodge. As with many mines in Arizona and New Mexico at the time, the Detroit Copper Co. saw several waves of labor union organizing as well as strikes from 1900 onward. DCC used labor spies to infiltrate nascent unions and stop organizing campaigns.A significant problem in early copper camps were disputes over ownership of ore bodies based on the 1872 Mining Law's \"rule of the apex.\" This was defined where the company which owned the apex (or outcrop) of an ore body could mine ore across mine claim boundaries following vein \"dips, spurs, and angles\u201d. Church was able to avoid a potential lawsuit with neighboring claim holders by agreeing to ignore the rule of the apex and use British common law, whereby the companies extracted ore from only within their claim boundaries. In May 1882, Church's company agreed to co-develop the \"Detroit lode\" with the Longfellow Copper Mining Company (later purchased by the Arizona Copper Company). Although federal and state law provided that the company which accessed the lode had the right to develop the entire deposit, Detroit Copper lacked the capital to do so and agreed to permit Longfellow Copper to mine the lode as well, up to their agreed claim boundaries. This shift away from the rule of the apex to common law was followed later in other Arizona copper districts, most notably at Bisbee, Arizona.After the 1917 reorganization of the Phelps Dodge & Co holding company into the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the Detroit Copper Company ceased to exist. The operation was then known as \"Phelps Dodge Corporation, Morenci Branch.\" In 1921, Phelps Dodge acquired the mines of the adjacent Arizona Copper Company, Ltd, creating a world class copper operation, which is now one of the largest copper producers in the United States.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Many 19th-century writers such as Ambrose Bierce, Yda Addis, Emma Frances Dawson, and Gertrude Atherton appeared regularly in its pages.

Originally based in Froland, since 1969 it operated out of Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik. Agderfly was owned by Ola Rustenberg, who was also chief instructor.  From 1989 to 1992 the company was split into three, with one part responsible for scheduled services. It operated two Dornier 228 and flew services from Kristiansand to Gothenburg, Billund and Bremen.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "159_67276", "text": "Agderfly was established by Ola Rustenberg when he bought a Jodel D.120 in 1966. The airline was initially based at Trevann in Froland. Two years later it bought a second aircraft, a Malm\u00f6 MFI-9B and started using it for pilot training. Agderfly relocated to Kjevik in 1969.An accident in 1974 caused Agderfly to replace its MFI with a Beagle Pup. It was replaced with a Robin DR400 three years later. It was supplemented with a Piper Cherokee in 1979. The same year the company built a hangar. This allowed the operations to expand. First a Partenavia P.68 was bought, then replaced with two Piper Seneca. Agderfly signed a contract to fly patients from Vest-Agder Central Hospital to Oslo in 1980.During the early 1980s Agderfly shifted its business model. A cooperation was started with Skjelbreds Rederi and the aviation company changed its name to A/S Nortrans Agderfly. During this period the Senecas were sold and replaced with a Piper Navajo and a Piper Aztec. For a period it also leased a Mitsubishi MU-2. Rustenstad bought back the part of the company he didn't own in 1985 and changed the name back to Agderfly. The MU2 was sold in 1987 and replaced with a Grumman Cougar, a Bellanca Super Decathlon and a Socata Rallye. During this period the pilot school specialized in converting military pilots to civilian certificates, and offered commercial B, C and D licenses.The partnership with Skjelbred resulted in Agderfly seeking to establish itself as a scheduled airline. It applied in for concession to operate to Gothenburg from Kristiansand. This was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in 1986, citing Scandinavian Airlines System's monopoly on inter-Scandinavian routes. However, the regulations were gradually being deregulated an on 13 November 1987 the airline was granted its concession.Agderfly went through a major restructuring to operate the service. It was split into three operating companies, one for the school, one for the mechanical services and one for the passenger flights. This resulted in the ownership in the flight company being spread out between a series of local investors. Svein Gr\u00f8dum had in late 1989 a 40-percent ownership, while Thor Tj\u00f8ntveit owned 30 percent. Minor owners were Leif Hubert, Oddleiv Eidjord and Einar \u00d8grey. Twice in 1989 the company issued new shares, increasing its share capital from 1 to 2 million Norwegian krone (NOK).It opted in late 1988 to buy two Dornier 228 for Norving for the route. The same year it received permission to operate a route to Billund Airport in Denmark. The service to G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport commenced on 26 September 1989, followed by the Billund route on 2 October.Eidjord became the majority shareholder of the flight company in September 1990, after buying shares from among others Tj\u00f8ntveit and Gr\u00f8dum. Agderfly received concession to operate from Kristiansand to Bremen Airport and started these flights in early 1991. In early 1991 the airline wet leased its aircraft to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to fly relief aid to Turkey and Iran. This and other chapter operations were profitable for the company, while the scheduled services ran at a loss.Eidfjord sold his share of the company and Air Express to Petter Ringvold in May 1991. He reorganize the companies so that Agderfly became a subsidiary of Air Express. By September only the Gothenburg route was still being flown, and even it was incurring a loss of NOK 100,000 per month. The airline was futile in its attempts to receive municipal subsidies to cover the operating losses. Agderfly's flight company filed for bankruptcy on 21 November 1991, citing that it was operating with a loss. At the time it had fourteen employees.Agderfly's school program was based on that the first part of the theory was taken as correspondence and the second part at the school, a system that had been in place since 1977. The Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) reacted to this in 1990, stating that the correspondence system was not in line with regulations.

The airline was initially based at Trevann in Froland. Two years later it bought a second aircraft, a Malm\u00f6 MFI-9B and started using it for pilot training. Agderfly relocated to Kjevik in 1969.An accident in 1974 caused Agderfly to replace its MFI with a Beagle Pup. It was replaced with a Robin DR400 three years later. It was supplemented with a Piper Cherokee in 1979. The same year the company built a hangar. This allowed the operations to expand. First a Partenavia P.68 was bought, then replaced with two Piper Seneca. Agderfly signed a contract to fly patients from Vest-Agder Central Hospital to Oslo in 1980.During the early 1980s Agderfly shifted its business model. A cooperation was started with Skjelbreds Rederi and the aviation company changed its name to A/S Nortrans Agderfly. During this period the Senecas were sold and replaced with a Piper Navajo and a Piper Aztec. For a period it also leased a Mitsubishi MU-2. Rustenstad bought back the part of the company he didn't own in 1985 and changed the name back to Agderfly. The MU2 was sold in 1987 and replaced with a Grumman Cougar, a Bellanca Super Decathlon and a Socata Rallye. During this period the pilot school specialized in converting military pilots to civilian certificates, and offered commercial B, C and D licenses.The partnership with Skjelbred resulted in Agderfly seeking to establish itself as a scheduled airline. It applied in for concession to operate to Gothenburg from Kristiansand. This was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in 1986, citing Scandinavian Airlines System's monopoly on inter-Scandinavian routes. However, the regulations were gradually being deregulated an on 13 November 1987 the airline was granted its concession.Agderfly went through a major restructuring to operate the service. It was split into three operating companies, one for the school, one for the mechanical services and one for the passenger flights. This resulted in the ownership in the flight company being spread out between a series of local investors. Svein Gr\u00f8dum had in late 1989 a 40-percent ownership, while Thor Tj\u00f8ntveit owned 30 percent. Minor owners were Leif Hubert, Oddleiv Eidjord and Einar \u00d8grey. Twice in 1989 the company issued new shares, increasing its share capital from 1 to 2 million Norwegian krone (NOK).It opted in late 1988 to buy two Dornier 228 for Norving for the route. The same year it received permission to operate a route to Billund Airport in Denmark. The service to G\u00f6teborg Landvetter Airport commenced on 26 September 1989, followed by the Billund route on 2 October.Eidjord became the majority shareholder of the flight company in September 1990, after buying shares from among others Tj\u00f8ntveit and Gr\u00f8dum. Agderfly received concession to operate from Kristiansand to Bremen Airport and started these flights in early 1991. In early 1991 the airline wet leased its aircraft to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to fly relief aid to Turkey and Iran. This and other chapter operations were profitable for the company, while the scheduled services ran at a loss.Eidfjord sold his share of the company and Air Express to Petter Ringvold in May 1991. He reorganize the companies so that Agderfly became a subsidiary of Air Express. By September only the Gothenburg route was still being flown, and even it was incurring a loss of NOK 100,000 per month. The airline was futile in its attempts to receive municipal subsidies to cover the operating losses. Agderfly's flight company filed for bankruptcy on 21 November 1991, citing that it was operating with a loss. At the time it had fourteen employees.Agderfly's school program was based on that the first part of the theory was taken as correspondence and the second part at the school, a system that had been in place since 1977. The Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) reacted to this in 1990, stating that the correspondence system was not in line with regulations. They did not react to that part of the courses were taken as correspondence, but rather the amount of the material which followed this material. They therefore withdrew Agderfly's approval in 1990.

It currently holds 19 of the 128 seats in Lebanon's parliament and is therefore the largest party in parliament.\nThe organization was created in 1976 by Pierre and Bachir Gemayel, Camille Chamoun, and other party leaders during the Lebanese Civil War. It was initially an umbrella organization coordinating all the right-wing party militias of the Lebanese Front and served as the main resistance force of the front. The Kataeb Regulatory Forces provided the largest share of fighters, and the Kataeb Party had the largest share on the council. Despite its original creation from party militias, the Lebanese Forces accepted new recruits without any specific party allegiance.\nDuring the civil war, the Lebanese Forces fought different opponents at different times: the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the Lebanese National Movement, the Lebanese National Resistance Front, the Syrian Army, the Druze-dominated Progressive Socialist Party in the Chouf, and the Lebanese Army loyal to General Michel Aoun. After the assassination of its leader, Bachir Gemayel, in 1982, political friction within the Lebanese Front resulted in growing distance between the Kataeb militants and the rest of the Lebanese Forces. In the end, the Lebanese Forces and Kataeb became two separate forces within the Lebanese Front. A few uprisings led to Lebanese Forces commander-in-chief Samir Geagea taking over and dissolving the Lebanese Front in the late 1980s.\nAfter the civil war ended, Geagea created the Lebanese Forces Party. In 1994, while Lebanon was under Syrian occupation, the party was banned, Geagea imprisoned and the activities of its militants repressed by the Lebanese services in Lebanon. The Lebanese Forces returned as a political force after the Cedar Revolution in early 2005, which resulted in a withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.

The CBC also operates digital services including CBC.ca/Ici.Radio-Canada.ca, CBC Radio 3, CBC Music/ICI.mu, and Ici.TOU.TV.\nCBC/Radio-Canada offers programming in English, French, and eight indigenous languages on its domestic radio service, and in five languages on its web-based international radio service, Radio Canada International (RCI). However, budget cuts in the early 2010s have contributed to the corporation reducing its service via the airwaves, discontinuing RCI's shortwave broadcasts as well as terrestrial television broadcasts in all communities served by network-owned rebroadcast transmitters, including communities not subject to Canada's over-the-air digital television transition.\nThe CBC's federal funding is supplemented by revenue from commercial advertising on its television broadcasts. The radio service employed commercials from its inception to 1974, but since then its primary radio networks have been commercial-free. In 2013, the CBC's secondary radio networks, CBC Music and Ici Musique, introduced limited advertising of up to four minutes an hour, but this was discontinued in 2016.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "159_67347", "text": "In 1929, the Aird Commission on public broadcasting recommended the creation of a national radio broadcast network.

Graham Spry and Alan Plaunt lobbied intensely for the project on behalf of the Canadian Radio League. In 1932 the government of R. B.

The network was used to broadcast programming to riders aboard its passenger trains, with coverage primarily in central and eastern Canada. On November 2, 1936, the CRBC was reorganized under its present name. While the CRBC was a state-owned company, the CBC was a Crown corporation on the model of the British Broadcasting Corporation, which had been reformed from a private company into a statutory corporation in 1927. Leonard Brockington was the CBC's first chairman.For the next few decades, the CBC was responsible for all broadcasting innovation in Canada. This was in part because, until 1958, it was not only a broadcaster but the chief regulator of Canadian broadcasting. It used this dual role to snap up most of the clear-channel licences in Canada. It began a separate French-language radio network in December 1937. It introduced FM radio to Canada in 1946, though a distinct FM service was not launched until 1960.Television broadcasts from the CBC began on September 6, 1952, with the opening of a station in Montreal, Quebec (CBFT), and a station in Toronto, Ontario (CBLT) opening two days later. The CBC's first privately owned affiliate television station, CKSO in Sudbury, Ontario, launched in October 1953. At the time, all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC, a condition that relaxed in 1960\u201361 with the launch of CTV.\nFrom 1944 to 1962, the CBC split its English-language radio network into two services known as the Trans-Canada Network and the Dominion Network. The latter, carrying lighter programs including American radio shows, was dissolved in 1962, while the former became known as CBC Radio.

Designed by scale model artist Jean-Paul Boileau, it consisted of the legends \"CBC\" and \"Radio-Canada\" overlaid on a map of Canada. For French programming, the \"Radio-Canada\" was placed on top.\nThe \"Butterfly\" logo was designed for the CBC by Hubert Tison in 1966 to mark the network's progressing transition from black-and-white to colour television, much in the manner of the NBC peacock logo. It was used at the beginning of programs broadcast in colour and was used until all CBC television programs had switched to colour. A sketch on the CBC Television program Wayne & Shuster once referred to this as the logo of the \"Cosmic Butterfly Corporation\".The fourth logo, known internally as \"the gem\", was designed for the CBC by graphic artist Burton Kramer in December 1974, and it is the most widely recognized symbol of the corporation. The main on-air identification featured the logo kaleidoscopically morphing into its form while radiating outward from the center of the screen on a blue background.

In the U.S. he continued his career as an on-air personality at a New York radio station after arriving in the United States before being promoted to programming director. He subsequently owned a recording studio and advertising agency before borrowing $3.5 million USD to purchase the first SBS radio station, WSKQ-AM (La Super 1380) in 1983 with his son, Ra\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n Jr. Alarc\u00f3n Sr. would serve as SBS Chairman of the board of directors, while his son would serve as an account executive in the sales department.SBS generated sales of about $20 million in its first year, confirming the influence of the growing Spanish-speaking audience. Ra\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n Jr. became President of SBS and a director in October 1985. In 1988 SBS purchased its first FM station, regional Mexican KLAX 97.9 FM in Los Angeles. The company went public in the fall of 1991, raising $435.8 million by selling 21.8 million shares at $20 per share. SBS bought its third station, New York's WSKQ-FM, in 1989. In 1993 Alfredo Alonso was hired and reformatted it as Mega 97.9, La Mega, surpassing the market's longtime leader, the light rock station WLTW-FM, by 1998. A major turning point for Spanish radio occurred that year when media researchers at Arbitron rated La Mega's morning show number one over that of the radio personality Howard Stern. \n\nIn 2002 the company created SBS Entertainment, a concert production arm. It also diversified by purchasing 80 percent of JuJu Media, the operator of the Spanish-English Web site LaMusica.com, which offered Latin music, entertainment, news, and culture. Later that year, at the insistence of Alarc\u00f3n Jr., SBS launched KZAB-FM (La Sabrosa 93.5), targeting the Central American population in Los Angeles. In 2003, WSKQ was the most listened-to Spanish-language radio station in the United States.

In the U.S. he continued his career as an on-air personality at a New York radio station after arriving in the United States before being promoted to programming director. He subsequently owned a recording studio and advertising agency before borrowing $3.5 million USD to purchase the first SBS radio station, WSKQ-AM (La Super 1380) in 1983 with his son, Ra\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n Jr. Alarc\u00f3n Sr. would serve as SBS Chairman of the board of directors, while his son would serve as an account executive in the sales department.SBS generated sales of about $20 million in its first year, confirming the influence of the growing Spanish-speaking audience. Ra\u00fal Alarc\u00f3n Jr. became President of SBS and a director in October 1985. In 1988 SBS purchased its first FM station, regional Mexican KLAX 97.9 FM in Los Angeles. The company went public in the fall of 1991, raising $435.8 million by selling 21.8 million shares at $20 per share. SBS bought its third station, New York's WSKQ-FM, in 1989. In 1993 Alfredo Alonso was hired and reformatted it as Mega 97.9, La Mega, surpassing the market's longtime leader, the light rock station WLTW-FM, by 1998.

Under the new settlement, credit-reporting firms are required to use trained employees to respond when a consumer flags a mistake on their file. These employees are responsible for communicating with the lender and resolving the dispute.In January 2017, TransUnion was fined $5.5 million and ordered to pay $17.6 million in restitution, along with Equifax, by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The federal agency fined the companies \"for deceiving consumers about the usefulness and actual cost of credit scores they sold to consumers\". The CFPB also said the companies \"lured consumers into costly recurring payments for credit-related products with false promises\". Credit bureaus had the most complaints of all companies filed with the CFPB by consumers in 2018, with 34% of all complaints directed at TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian that year.In June 2017, a California jury ruled against TransUnion with a $60 million verdict in the largest Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) verdict in history.\nThe San Francisco federal court jury awarded $60 million in damages to consumers who were falsely reported on a government list of terrorists and other security threats. The plaintiffs' team of attorneys at Francis & Mailman, P.C. partnered with another California-based firm in the class action.\nFollowing up on this, in April 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said TransUnion is \"incapable of operating its businesses lawfully\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

They used to play their football at Cardiff Athletics Stadium in Leckwith. \nThe Quins were formed in 1935, and progressed in the 1990s from 'parks' football into the Welsh League, via the FAW Pyramid system. The club won the Welsh League Challenge Cup in 1995.\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, they played in the Welsh Premier League. However, a lack of finances and fan support led to the departure of key players, leaving the club to rely on youth and reserve players.

A second relegation followed in 2006\u201307, and the club's prospects of returning to the Premier in the short term looked slim.With the demolition of the old Cardiff Athletics Stadium in 2007 Grange Quins lost their home ground. Because a replacement was not due to be completed until late 2009 the Quins had nowhere to play and, in any case, were considering withdrawing from the Welsh League because of the far higher costs of playing at the new Cardiff International Sports Stadium.The club had a long-standing rivalry with fellow Cardiff side Cardiff Corinthians which dated back to the 1980s, when both clubs were fierce cross-city rivals and took part in some mouth-watering fixtures. Both clubs have rarely been in the same division, but the rivalry resumed in 2014\u201315 with the Corinthians relegation to Division 3.\nIn 2014\u201315 the Cardiff Grange Harlequins resigned from the Welsh League towards the end of the season and their record was expunged.\nThe team continued to play in the Cardiff & District League for a season, though with none of the players that played in the Welsh League, using the park facilities at Pontcanna Fields as their home ground.

HP developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components, as well as software and related services to consumers, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health, and education sectors. The company was founded in a one-car garage in Palo Alto by Bill Hewlett and David Packard in 1939, and initially produced a line of electronic test and measurement equipment. The HP Garage at 367 Addison Avenue is now designated an official California Historical Landmark, and is marked with a plaque calling it the \"Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'\".\nThe company won its first big contract in 1938 to provide the HP 200B, a variation of its first product, the HP 200A low-distortion frequency oscillator for Walt Disney's production of the animated film Fantasia, which allowed Hewlett and Packard to formally establish the Hewlett-Packard Company on July 2, 1939. The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its products. HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 until the second quarter of 2013, when Lenovo moved ahead of HP. HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware; designing software; and delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software, and a range of printers and other imaging products. The company directly marketed its products to households; small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises, as well as via online distribution; consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers; software partners; and major technology vendors. It also offered services and a consulting business for its products and partner products.\nIn 1999, HP spun off its electronic and bio-analytical test and measurement instruments business into Agilent Technologies; HP retained focus on its later products, including computers and printers. It merged with Compaq in 2002, and acquired Electronic Data Systems in 2008, which led to combined revenues of $118.4 billion that year and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009. In November 2009, HP announced its acquisition of 3Com, and closed the deal on April 12, 2010. On April 28, 2010, HP announced its buyout of Palm, Inc. for $1.2 billion. On September 2, 2010, HP won its bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07 billion), which Dell declined to match.On November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard was split into two separate companies; its enterprise products and services business were spun-off to form Hewlett Packard Enterprise, while its personal computer and printer businesses became HP Inc.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "740_17546", "text": "Bill Hewlett and David Packard graduated with degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1935.

Owner Al Copeland (1944\u20132008) wanted to compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken, but his restaurant failed after several months. Copeland reopened the restaurant four days later as Popeyes Mighty Good Chicken. By 1975, the company had been renamed as Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken. Copeland started franchising his restaurant in 1976, beginning in Louisiana. The chain expanded to Canada in 1984, and opened its 500th restaurant in 1985. B. P.

Two hundred additional locations were added during a period of slower expansion.By 1990, Copeland Enterprises was in default on $391 million in debts it had taken on in its 1989 purchase of Church's, a rival fast food chain also focusing in fried chicken, and by April 1991, the company filed for bankruptcy protection. In October 1992, the court approved a plan by a group of Copeland's creditors that resulted in the creation of America's Favorite Chicken Company, Inc. (AFC) to serve as the new parent company for Popeyes and Church's. AFC went public in 2001 with initial public offering (IPO) of $142,818,479.

The party was founded with the active sponsorship of the Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) in May 1977 from anti-communist dissidents opposed to Mozambique's ruling FRELIMO party. RENAMO was initially led by Andr\u00e9 Matsangaissa, a former senior official in FRELIMO's armed wing, and was composed of several anti-communist dissident groups which appeared immediately prior to, and shortly following, Mozambican independence. Matsangaissa, who died in 1979, was succeeded by Afonso Dhlakama, who led the organization until his death in 2018. He was succeeded by Ossufo Momade.Critics of RENAMO frequently described the movement as a proxy of Rhodesia and latterly, South Africa's apartheid government. It has been theorised that RENAMO was formed for the sole purpose of countering FRELIMO support for the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). On the other hand, RENAMO was also reflective of FRELIMO's own splintering support base and dwindling popularity in the immediate post-independence era. Its political programme centered around the abandonment of FRELIMO's socialist policies, the adoption of a free market economy, and more traditionalist concerns such as the reinstatement of tribal leaders to positions of authority. RENAMO's ranks included a number of Mozambican political exiles who genuinely opposed FRELIMO on principle, including FRELIMO defectors disillusioned with its Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology, but also large numbers of recruits conscripted by force.With Rhodesian support, RENAMO commenced an insurgency against the FRELIMO government in 1977, sparking the Mozambican Civil War. The war was characterised by severe human rights violations on both sides and crippled the already debilitated Mozambican economy. RENAMO and FRELIMO acceded to the Rome General Peace Accords in October 1992, which ended FRELIMO's oneparty state and introduced multi-party democratic elections. In return, RENAMO pledged to abandon its armed struggle and conduct its future activities by political means within the framework of the new electoral system. Following the end of the war, RENAMO was responsible for promoting constitutional reforms as well as the promotion of a strong domestic private sector.Renewed clashes broke out between RENAMO's militant forces and the FRELIMO government in 2013. RENAMO resumed its insurgency, citing state corruption and electoral fraud perpetuated by FRELIMO officials. A second peace agreement was reached between RENAMO and FRELIMO in August 2019, resulting in the virtual end of the insurgency. A RENAMO splinter group known as the RENAMO Military Junta (RMJ) was quickly formed from party dissidents opposed to the peace process; the RMJ continued to carry out minor guerrilla operations until December 2021, when the last of its members surrendered to Mozambican security forces.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "159_67710", "text": "In October 2012, RENAMO's headquarters were relocated near Casa Banana (also named Sathunjira, RENAMO's former guerrilla base in the 1980s) in Gorongosa, where a training camp was set up for around 800 partially armed followers.

The Brothers Radi\u0107 believed that the realization of Croatian statehood was possible within Austria-Hungary, but that it had to be reformed as a Monarchy divided into three equal parts \u2013 Austria, Hungary, Croatia. After the creation of Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1918, Party requested for the Croatian part of the Kingdom to be based on self-determination. This brought them great public support which culminated in 1920 parliamentary election when HPSS won all 58 seats assigned to Croatia.\nIn 1920, disgruntled with a bad position of Croats in the Kingdom, the party changed its name into Croatian Republican Peasant Party (HRSS) and started advocating secession from the Kingdom and the establishment of \"peaceful peasant Republic of Croatia\". On 1923 and 1925 election, HRSS doubled the number of won votes, and has thus become the second largest party in the Parliament.\nIn 1927, faced with a constant prosecution by the regime, HRSS was forced to soften its policy, change its name into Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), recognize the Vidovdan Constitution and form a coalition with Serbian People's Radical Party. This resulted in HSS losing its popularity which was seen in 1927 election when it lost almost third of votes won in the previous elections. After the termination of the coalition agreement with the Radicals, HSS formed Peasant-Democratic Coalition with Pribi\u010devi\u0107's Independent Democratic Party. In 1928, Vladko Ma\u010dek become the new president of HSS after the assassination of Stjepan Radi\u0107.\nAfter King Alexander declared dictatorship in 1929, HSS was banned and its members prosecuted. HSS participated in the 1935 and 1938 election as a part of the United opposition coalition which helped it to regain its influence. In 1939, Cvetkovi\u0107\u2013Ma\u010dek Agreement helped in the establishing of the HSS-governed Banovina of Croatia. After the establishment of Nazi-puppet state, the so-called Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in 1941, HSS was banned once again, with half of its members joining either Usta\u0161e or Partisans, and part staying loyal to Ma\u010dek who believed that the victory of Allies would bring liberal democracy into Croatia and that HSS would return to power. In May 1945, Ma\u010dek left the country, while HSS split into two fractions which boycotted the 1945 election because of their opposition to the Communists. During the period of SFR Yugoslavia (1945\u20131991), HSS was active abroad.\nOn 25 May 1991, HSS was restored under the leadership of Drago Stipac at the so-called Assembly of Unification. The party first entered Government after 2000 elections, on which it participated as part of liberal coalition (HSS-IDS-HNS-LS-SDA), with Ivica Ra\u010dan (SDP) serving as Prime Minister and its president Zlatko Tom\u010di\u0107 as Parliament Speaker. After HSS lost 2003 election, it moved to the opposition. In 2007 election, HSS formed yet another liberal coalition (HSLS-PGS-ZDS-ZS) and eventually ended up leading Ministries of Tourism and Agriculture in the Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II, and Ministries of Tourism and Regional Development in the Cabinet of Jadranka Kosor. In 2011 election, the party won only one seat in the Parliament as has moved to the opposition. In 2015 election HSS won one seat as part of the conservative Patriotic Coalition, and supported Tihomir Ore\u0161kovi\u0107 as Prime Minister.

Highlighting its plans to offer the Voice and Data phone (predecessor to the smartphone), his Racal-Millicom joint-venture was renamed Vodafone.On 12 October 1983, Millicom Inc. created China Telecom Systems (HK), a joint-venture with partners China Resources Ltd. and Comvik, a Swedish mobile firm also controlled by Jan Stenbeck. China Telecom Systems (HK) held the first cellular telephone contract in China, making its service available to the public on 20 May 1985. In December 1989, Millicom set up Microtel Communications Ltd. by teaming up with Pacific Telesis and British Aerospace (later bought out by Hutchison Telecom.) Microtel was awarded a personal communication network (PCN) license to compete with Vodafone in the United Kingdom, a service launched on 28 April 1994 under its brand name, Orange. This venture was acquired in October 1999, at which time Orange and its new parent, Mannesmann, were in turn both taken over by Vodafone. At a value of $202 billion, the takeover of Mannesmann by Vodafone was the largest transaction in corporate history. Orange (formerly Microtel) was then sold to France Telecom, which subsequently changed its corporate name to Orange.To better manage their respective mobile interests, Millicom Inc. combined with Comvik's international cellular operations to become Millicom International Cellular SA in 1990, which now operates under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. In 2000, Millicom started investing in three continents: Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In 2004, Millicom conceptualized the TIGO brand.

Millicom completed the sale of its Asian business segment in 2011 with the sale of Laos. It previously operated in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. With the sale of its last remaining Asian operation, Millicom shifted its focus to Latin America and Africa.\nMillicom launched its first 4G high-speed internet services in Colombia in 2014, followed by Bolivia later in the year, and the remaining markets soon after. In 2014, Millicom launched the TIGO Sports Television channel in Paraguay and Bolivia.In 2012, Millicom partnered with UNICEF to protect children's rights, later renewing the partnership in 2020 to cover child online protection, and as virtual education gained prominence during the COVID-19 global pandemic.  In 2016, Millicom partnered with Microsoft to provide cloud services to its Tigo Business customers in eight markets in Latin America. In 2017, Millicom launched TIGO ONEtv, the first Next Generation TV (NGTV) service for LATAM customers, integrating traditional linear television content with over-the-top platforms, as well as video on-demand. In 2018, Millicom acquired Cable Onda in Panama.  In 2019, Millicom expanded its Latin American presence, acquiring subsidiaries of Telef\u00f3nica in Central America (Panama and Nicaragua). In addition, in 2019, Millicom common shares started trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market in the United States under the symbol TIGO.

The trust was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2009.The former Harvest Energy Trust's oil fields are mainly in Alberta, with two in Saskatchewan; it also has assets in northern British Columbia known as the Hay River Field.  Oil sand deposits and all natural gas properties were in Alberta.  As of the end of 2007, Harvest claimed a production of 61,000 BOE/d (barrels or equivalent per day), and a probable lifespan of existing assets of about ten years, before depletion.  It claims a total original oil in place (OOIP) amount of 2 billion barrels (320,000,000 m3), and another 1 billion barrels (160,000,000 m3) in oil sands.

The company was co-founded by Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson in 1957. Olsen was president until he was forced to resign in 1992, after the company had gone into precipitous decline.\nThe company produced many different product lines over its history. It is best known for the work in the minicomputer market starting in the mid-1960s. The company produced a series of machines known as the PDP line, with the PDP-8 and PDP-11 being among the most successful minis in history. Their success was only surpassed by another DEC product, the late-1970s VAX \"supermini\" systems that were designed to replace the PDP-11. Although a number of competitors had successfully competed with Digital through the 1970s, the VAX cemented the company's place as a leading vendor in the computer space.\nAs microcomputers improved in the late 1980s, especially with the introduction of RISC-based workstation machines, the performance niche of the minicomputer was rapidly eroded. By the early 1990s, the company was in turmoil as their mini sales collapsed and their attempts to address this by entering the high-end market with machines like the VAX 9000 were market failures. After several attempts to enter the workstation and file server market, the DEC Alpha product line began to make successful inroads in the mid-1990s, but was too late to save the company.\nDEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. During the purchase, some parts of DEC were sold to other companies; the compiler business and the Hudson Fab were sold to Intel. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence.

In the mid-20th century, it abandoned butter production and expanded to the entire state of Texas and soon much of the Southern United States. The company's corporate headquarters are located at the \"Little Creamery\" in Brenham, Texas. Since 1919, it has been in the hands of the Kruse family. As of 2015, Blue Bell was the #2 selling ice cream manufacturer in the United States.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "740_18807", "text": "The company has its roots in the Brenham Creamery Company, which opened in 1907 to purchase excess cream from local dairy farmers and sell butter to people in Brenham, Texas, a town situated approximately 70 miles (110 km) northwest of Houston. In 1911, the creamery began to produce small quantities of ice cream.By 1919, the Creamery was in financial trouble and considered closing its doors. The board of directors hired E.F. Kruse, a 23-year-old former schoolteacher, to take over the company on April 1, 1919. Kruse refused to accept a salary for his first few months in the position so that the company would not be placed in further debt.  Under his leadership, the company expanded its production of ice cream to the surrounding Brenham area and soon became profitable. At his suggestion, the company was renamed Blue Bell Creameries in 1930 after Kruse's favorite wildflower the Texas bluebell, which, like ice cream, thrives during the summer.Until 1936, the creamery made ice cream by the batch. It could create a 10-US-gallon (38 L) batch of ice cream every 20 minutes. That same year, in 1936, the company purchased its first continuous ice cream freezer, which could make 80 US gallons (300 L) of ice cream per hour. The ice cream would run through a spigot, allowing it to be poured into any size container.Kruse was diagnosed with cancer in 1951 and died within 8 weeks. His sons Ed and Howard took over leadership of the company. By the 1960s, the company completely abandoned the production of butter and began focusing solely on ice cream. After many years of selling ice cream only in Brenham, the company began selling its ice cream in the Houston area, eventually expanding throughout most of Texas including the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex and the state capital of Austin. By the end of the 1970s, sales had quadrupled, and by 1980 the creamery was producing over 10 million gallons (37,850,000 liters) of ice cream per year, earning $30 million annually.In 1989, Blue Bell began selling its ice cream in Oklahoma, and throughout the 1990s expansion pushed throughout the South Central and Southern United States, eventually expanding out to New Orleans and Jackson, Mississippi. In 1992, Blue Bell built a new manufacturing facility in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.  Four years later, in 1996, Blue Bell opened a third manufacturing facility in Sylacauga, Alabama, southeast of Birmingham, and eventually expanded into Atlanta and Miami. Once Blue Bell establishes itself within a market, word-of-mouth usually ensures that consumers in adjacent areas become aware of the brand. Blue Bell has been slow to expand: company executives say they thoroughly research each new market and ensure that all employees in the new markets are fully trained in Blue Bell practices so that product quality can be upheld. Blue Bell often tends to expand to markets during March each year, expanding to Colorado on March 14, 2011, followed by the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas of Virginia in 2013, and Las Vegas in 2014. These expansions are accompanied with the purchase and/or construction of distribution centers in new markets that serve areas within a 75-mile (121 km) radius.\nIn 2015, Blue Bell issued a series of recalls (see below for more on this) that eventually shut down production and led to all of its products being recalled on April 20, culminating in job cuts and furloughs (as well as the reduction of its 23-state sales territory) resulting from the shutdown the following May. In conjunction with factory cleanup procedures and agreements with state and federal authorities, the company returned to production three months later on a limited basis, returning its products to the market on August 31 in portions of Texas and Alabama as part of a five-phase plan to return to much of its pre-recall distribution territory, which has been reduced to 21 states based on Blue Bell's limited distribution capabilities in the near term.\nIn 2018, children of an interracial family posted an open letter on Facebook addressed to Blue Bell asking that the flavor \"The Great Divide\" (equal halves of chocolate and vanilla ice cream) be changed to \"Better Together\". While Blue Bell spokespersons reacted positively to the name change proposal, the post became controversial among some Facebook users who dismissed the original name as inoffensive.\nIn July 2019, The Blue Bell Creameries faced an issue that went viral after a teenage female licked one of their ice cream tubs at a Walmart in Lufkin, Texas, then placed it back in the freezer. She was later arrested. After the incident, multiple copycats were committed, and some were jailed.

These facilities employed a combined 2,800 employees, with 850 of the employees working out of Brenham. In 2006, annual sales exceeded $400 million.Blue Bell retains control over all aspects of its business, primarily to ensure quality control and the use of the freshest ingredients available.  The Kruses claim \"the milk we use is so fresh it was grass only yesterday.\"  The company uses milk from approximately 60,000 cows each day, and the cream used during each day's production run is always less than 24 hours old.

Drivers of delivery vehicles personally stock store shelves so they can ensure it is handled properly.According to figures gathered by Statista, a market data and statistics portal, while combined private labels sold more, in 2014 Blue Bell was the best-selling ice cream brand in the United States. The sales area is primarily concentrated in the Southern United States, and has been sold as far west as Las Vegas, as far north as Indianapolis and Denver, and as far east as Richmond, Virginia.

For example, in its home state of Texas, the company has a 52% market share. Within five months of its entry into Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the company had garnered 35% of the ice cream market. People living outside the sales area can have the ice cream shipped to them (although this has temporarily been halted while the company is ramping up production after the recalls), and former President George W.

The sales area is primarily concentrated in the Southern United States, and has been sold as far west as Las Vegas, as far north as Indianapolis and Denver, and as far east as Richmond, Virginia. Overall, this area comprises only 20% of the United States. By comparison, each of Blue Bell's top four competitors sells its products in 100% of the United States. To become one of the three biggest ice cream manufacturers, Blue Bell has consistently been the top seller in the majority of the markets the company has entered. For example, in its home state of Texas, the company has a 52% market share. Within five months of its entry into Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the company had garnered 35% of the ice cream market. People living outside the sales area can have the ice cream shipped to them (although this has temporarily been halted while the company is ramping up production after the recalls), and former President George W. Bush (a former Governor of Texas) often had the ice cream shipped to Camp David during his administration. In 2006 and 2012, astronauts aboard the International Space Station were also treated to Blue Bell ice cream \"to help out (the crew's) happiness quotient.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is located in the village of Brummana, situated in Metn, Mount Lebanon, 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) east of the capital city Beirut.\n\nThis school was established in 1873, by the Quaker Theophilus Waldmeier (a Swiss missionary).  Historically Quakers were among the pioneers in developing a modern form of learner-centred education which prized the worth and development of the whole child and student. With other educators, Quakers recognised that schooling involved far more than academic study. Today much internationally accepted good practice in education follows these principles. BHS remains a school which aims to follow the ideals and values of its Quaker founders.\nBrummana High School has been licensed and accredited by the Lebanese Ministry of Education to be a coeducational, boarding and day school for students in the classes of the infant, primary, intermediate and secondary schools in 1947.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "159_67816", "text": "Theophilus Waldmeier, a German-Swiss missionary, first came to Mount Lebanon in 1867, during the time of the Ottoman rule, and was engaged as inspector of branch schools in Beirut, the mountains, and Damascus.\nSome time between 1869 and 1874, Elijah G. Saleeby opened the first school in Brummana, a remote village overlooking Beirut (three hours from Beirut on horseback), called the \"Darlington Station\" because it was backed with Quaker (Religious Society of Friends) subscriptions from Darlington, England.\nIn 1873, Theophilus Waldmeier opened a girls' school in Brummana, with money sent to him by his friends in Switzerland. Before the end of the year he was sent further money from Switzerland to open a boys' school at Brummana. Many of the buildings of Brummana date to the time period; they were made of local stone and red tile.In 1874, Theophilus Waldmeier visited England to raise money for the school from the Society of Friends, and he himself became a Quaker. When he returned, he purchased 20,000 square yards of land called \"Berket al-Ghanem\" (The Pool of the Conqueror) which was a hillside of pine, fig, and mulberry trees with two fountains of water on the edge of Brummana.\nThe Friends' Syrian Mission (a committee of English and American Friends) approved the purchase and authorised the building  of a boys' school. In this same year, Elijah G. Saleeby handed over the \"Darlington Station\" school to Theophilus Waldmeier.\nIn 1876, the Boys' Training Home (now Brummana High School) was opened in a leased house in Brummana until the new building was ready. The land name was changed from \"Berket al-Ghanem\" to \"Ayn al-Salam\" (The Fountain of Peace). Within five years, the school had grown to 300 students, bringing literacy and new ideas to the isolated mountain area.\nWhen in 1878 the new Boy's Training Home building came into use, it housed the only dispensary in Mount Lebanon. As the medical work increased, in 1881 alternative accommodation was found in an old silk factory which was converted into a hospital with 15 beds on the ground floor and a dispensary and outpatient accommodation in the upper storey.\nIn 1882, the Girls' Training Home at Brummana was opened.\nEducation at Brummana High School was based on the principles of the Society of Friends, which stress non-violence, equality, the spirit of service and encouragement of the pursuit of higher standards through enlightened methods.\nIn 1889, the village of Brummana was linked by a new carriage road down the hill to Beirut below, but many students still arrived at the school gates by foot or donkey. At the turn of the century, BHS built the first tennis court in the Middle East.\nBy 1902, the Boys' Training Home had adopted the name Boys' High School. During that year, BHS became co-educational. It was one of the few fully co-educational schools.When in 1914 World War I began, the Ottomans took over the school hospital and occupied the school buildings which were not re-opened until 1919.  Despite the famine relief operation set up in the school's kitchens, approximately 400 out of 2000 Brummana villagers died in the great famine of 1915-18 (compared to 50% of the population of Lebanon).\nAfter the war, Lebanon was put under French mandate, and two decades of peace and prosperity followed. In 1928, new classrooms were constructed, in 1930, a new hospital pavilion to accommodate 36 beds was completed, and in 1936, the BHS Old Scholars Association was set up.\nIn 1920 Farideh Arkle joined the staff.

The Second World War seriously affected the life of the school.  The French followed by the British took over the school hospital. The British made the school their military headquarters for a year. Despite the war, the school stayed open with 22 boarders and 100 day students.\nLebanon became independent in 1943, and during the peace of the next three decades, the school's reputation for excellence and friendly diversity became known throughout the entire region.

(stylized as SiliconGraphics before 1999, later rebranded SGI, historically known as Silicon Graphics Computer Systems or SGCS) was an American high-performance computing manufacturer, producing computer hardware and software. Founded in Mountain View, California in November 1981 by James Clark, its initial market was 3D graphics computer workstations, but its products, strategies and market positions developed significantly over time.\nEarly systems were based on the Geometry Engine that Clark and Marc Hannah had developed at Stanford University, and were derived from Clark's broader background in computer graphics. The Geometry Engine was the first very-large-scale integration (VLSI) implementation of a geometry pipeline, specialized hardware that accelerated the \"inner-loop\" geometric computations needed to display three-dimensional images. For much of its history, the company focused on 3D imaging and was a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market.\nSilicon Graphics reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 1990. Through the mid to late-1990s, the rapidly improving performance of commodity Wintel machines began to erode SGI's stronghold in the 3D market. The porting of Maya to other platforms was a major event in this process. SGI made several attempts to address this, including a disastrous move from their existing MIPS platforms to the Intel Itanium, as well as introducing their own Linux-based Intel IA-32 based workstations and servers that failed in the market. In the mid-2000s the company repositioned itself as a supercomputer vendor, a move that also failed.\nOn April 1, 2009, SGI filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to Rackable Systems, a deal finalized on May 11, 2009, with Rackable assuming the name Silicon Graphics International.

SN, for Scalable Node, is a technology developed by SGI in the mid-1990s that uses cache-coherent non-uniform memory access (cc-NUMA). In an SN system, processors, memory, and a bus- and memory-controller are coupled together into an entity called a node, usually on a single circuit board. Nodes are connected by a high-speed interconnect called NUMAlink (originally marketed as CrayLink). There is no internal bus, and instead access between processors, memory, and I/O devices is done through a switched fabric of links and routers.\nThanks to the cache coherence of the distributed shared memory, SN systems scale along several axes at once: as CPU count increases, so does memory capacity, I/O capacity, and system bisection bandwidth. This allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single OS image using standard shared-memory synchronization methods. This makes an SN system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustained-to-peak performance than non-cache-coherent systems like conventional clusters or massively parallel computers which require applications code to be written (or re-written) to do explicit message-passing communication between their nodes.\nThe first SN system, known as SN-0, was released in 1996 under the product name Origin 2000. Based on the MIPS R10000 processor, it scaled from 2 to 128 processors and a smaller version, the Origin 200 (SN-00), scaled from 1 to 4. Later enhancements enabled systems of as large as 512 processors.\nThe second generation system, originally called SN-1 but later SN-MIPS, was released in July 2000, as the Origin 3000. It scaled from 4 to 512 processors, and 1,024-processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers. A smaller, less scalable implementation followed, called Origin 300.\nIn November 2002, SGI announced a repackaging of its SN system, under the name Origin 3900. It quadrupled the processor area density of the SN-MIPS system, from 32 up to 128 processors per rack while moving to a \"fat tree\" interconnect topology.\nIn January 2003, SGI announced a variant of the SN platform called the Altix 3000 (internally called SN-IA).

At the time it was released, it was the world's most scalable Linux-based computer, supporting up to 64 processors in a single system node.

E.V.V. started to play in the Brabantse Voetbalbond, a regional league, but after a couple of years joined the NVB, the National League.

It was acquired by Dolby Laboratories, Inc. in April 2007 for US$28 million.The chief executive officer of BrightSide Technologies Inc. was Richard MacKellar. The   chief technology officer was Helge Seetzen, who went on to join Dolby as becoming director of HDR Technology at Dolby (2008 to 2010), before going on to found TandemLaunch, a Montreal-based technology incubator.\nThe main electronic display technology developed by BrightSide was based on IMLED-LCD which consisted of a LCD with an array of individually modulated LED semiconductors as the backlights, instead of cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) that diffuse light in a layer of plastic. Each LED has 256 brightness steps, where step 0 switches the LED off and step 255 switches it to maximum luminance. As a result, the device can display true black and very bright white, with a contrast ratio technically of infinity, where minimal luminance is 0 cd/m2 (the denominator) and maximal luminance is almost 4,000 cd/m2. To address the confusion that may accompany a display with a quoted contrast ratio of infinity, Brightside calculates its quoted contrast ratio using the next-darkest level available on the display to arrive at a contrast ratio of 200,000:1.\nBrightSide produced a prototype display to showcase their technology: the DR37-P. Targeted industries include the medical field, CAD, film post-production, geophysical data and satellite imaging.\nOn April 25, 2007 Dolby Laboratories, Inc. announced that it completed the acquisition of Brightside Technologies.

In 1920 he bought a partnership in a woodworking and furniture factory in Queen Street, Scarborough. In 1930 Slingsby was one of the founders of the Scarborough Gliding Club. After repairing some of the club's gliders, Slingsby's business built its first aircraft, a German designed RRG Falke which flew in 1931. By late 1933 Slingsby was advertising training gliders for sale. In 1934, encouraged by a local landowner, the business moved to Kirkbymoorside, some 30 miles from Scarborough, operating as Slingsby, Russell & Brown Ltd. As demand for gliders built up, a new factory was needed and built in Welburn, just outside Kirkbymoorside. This opened in July 1939, when Slingsby Sailplanes Ltd was founded. The best selling Slingsby glider in the pre-World War II period was the Primary.During the war Slingsby built parts for other company's aircraft as well as their own military glider, the Slingsby Hengist, though the latter did not see action. Towards the end of the war and afterwards the company produced large numbers of training gliders for the Air Training Corps (ATC). After the war Slingsby continued to make increasingly refined gliders for civilian use in clubs and competitions. Their greatest success was with the Sky at the 1952 World Gliding Championships, which finished in first, third and fourth place. The later Slingsby Skylark series was their post war best seller.

Slingsby\u2019s last glider, which was also their last original design, was the GRP Slingsby T.65 Vega.

A Clean Water Act amendment added regulation of storm-water runoff, and the Rock Creek Facility achieved 99% removal of ammonia nitrogen. In 1988, the Tualatin Valley Water Quality Endowment Fund was established by the Northwest Environmental Defense Center lawsuit.\nUSA worked to maintain the quality of the Tualatin River by establishing Surface Water Management (SWM) utility for water quality and drainage in 1990, and began a $200 million facility expansion and upgrade program to meet compliance deadlines. That same year, the agency established the River Rangers program. USA began consumption-based rates and combined billing with water providers in 1994.\nIn July 2001, the Unified Sewerage Agency renamed itself as Clean Water Services at a cost of $60,000. Clean Water Services' Operations Building opened in 2003, which is used as a showcase of low impact development. The same year, the Administrative Building Complex opened. It was the first LEED Gold certified public building in Washington County. In 2004, the agency began a program to add shade along the watershed's streams and river by planting trees and shrubs to lower temperatures of the waterways. This program received approval from environmental regulators and was in lieu of spending $150 million to build chilling systems at the four treatment facilities.The agency's Rock Creek facility won an EPA National Clean Water Act Recognition Award in 2006, and in 2008 the Durham facility's Influent Pump Station was the first to earn LEED Silver certification. The following year the Durham plant became the United States' first wastewater treatment plant to produce commercial fertilizer. In 2010, the Clean Water Institute was established by the agency.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "159_68109", "text": "Clean Water Services provides stormwater and wastewater services in partnership with 12 member cities that include; Beaverton, Tigard, Tualatin, Hillsboro, King City, Forest Grove, Sherwood, Cornelius, Banks, Gaston, Durham, and North Plains.\nClean Water Services is a special service district that serves as a separately managed and financed public utility. The Washington County Commissioners serve as the board of directors for Clean Water Services.As a wastewater utility, Clean Water Services cleans more than 60 million US gallons (230,000 m3) of wastewater a day. The wastewater treatment process uses physical, biological, and chemical treatment to clean wastewater to some of the highest standards in the nation. The cleaned wastewater is then released into the Tualatin River. The wastewater is collected by a vast network of more than 800 miles (1,300 km) of sewer lines and 39 pump stations and routed to one of four treatment plants\u2014Durham, Rock Creek, Hillsboro and Forest Grove.\nTen percent of the wastewater treated by Clean Water Services is used for irrigation and in area wetlands during the summer months. Biosolids recovered through the treatment process are sold to farmers in the region as fertilizer. Additionally, the Durham Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facility is the first in the nation to recover fertilizer from a natural byproduct of wastewater treatment. In 2007 the Durham facility began working with Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies to construct a $2.5 million multi-reactor plant  that allows the Durham facility to run part of its waste stream through special reactors that transform potentially damaging nutrients into environmentally friendly fertilizer, which Ostara sells commercially.As a surface water management utility, The District's Stormwater Management (SWM) program improves water quality, protects fish habitat and manages drainage by operating and maintaining the stormwater conveyance system, establishing design and construction standards, regulating activities that can impact the watershed and enhancing streams and floodplains. Clean Water Services is the regional SWM utility for urban Washington County. In cooperation with Washington County and the 12 member cities Clean Water Services maintains and enhances the public drainage system to meet public needs and to comply with strict water quality regulations set for the Tualatin River drainage area by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).Clean Water Services offers a classroom educational program called River Rangers geared toward 4th-grade students.  Environmental educators interactively teach students about the water cycle, watersheds, surface water pollution, water conservation and wastewater treatment.  The 45-minute presentation is used to educate students about how people impact water quality through use of sewer and storm systems.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The club management hugely emphasized providing memberships to the youth and maintained a strict code of conduct with an avowed objective of producing excellent sportsmen and imbuing them with impeccable moral and social values.At the first-anniversary assembly, the Presidency College students and members of the club invited their professor, F. J. Rowe, to attend. Rowe pointed out the inappropriate naming of the club and suggested replacing \"Sporting\" with \"Athletic\" since the club didn't indulge in sporting activities, like angling or rifle shooting. Thus, the members agreed and renamed the club as Mohun Bagan Athletic Club.The second-anniversary assembly was presided by Sir Thomas Holland, who later became a member of the Executive Council of Governor-General of India. In 1891, with the help of the Maharaja Durga Charan Laha of Shyampukur, the club ground was relocated within his residential estate, now known as Laha Colony. The club ground was later relocated to Shyam Square in Bagbazar, with the help of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation chairman, Henry Lee.

In 2012, Cognita staff were instructed to impersonate parents and take tours of competing schools in Wales. This conduct was defended as a \"normal\" way of assessing the competition.In 2012, Judge Robert Reid QC ruled that the Cognita-owned Milbourne Lodge in Esher, Surrey, had acted unfairly in removing two children, aged eight and six, without warning after the children's parents criticized the school's parents' association, the Friends of Milbourne Lodge, for lack of transparency in its fundraising and spending. The judge said that the parents' association was \"somewhat shadowy\" and a \"shambles\".Cognita's management of Southbank International School was criticised in 2011, with parents groups claiming it had \"no serious interest in maximising the educational experience of ... children if it impacts on their bottom line\". Then Chairman Chris Woodhead denied the allegations, claiming that its profits were in line with others in the sector.In 2014, the same school was accused of inadequately vetting staff after a former teacher, William Vahey, was found to have abused pupils over several years. In an article in The Guardian, the school's incoming chairman of governors, Sir Chris Woodhead was interviewed: \"The school said it had carried out checks dating back 17 years on Vahey, who had taught in international schools in eight countries. But they did not pick up on a 1969 conviction for child molestation in California. Vahey's CV showed he had been registered as a teacher in the state of New Jersey in 1986, and Woodhead said it was reasonable to have assumed that would not have been the case if he had been convicted of child molestation. 'The system in America broke down,' he said.\" Regulatory and statutory bodies have since praised the transformation of safeguarding practices and processes in the school as \"comprehensive and robust\".Parents at Cognita's Saint Andrews Sukhumvit 107 School in Bangkok, Thailand, prepared a petition containing an open email to Sir Chris Woodhead in 2012, alleging lack of transparency and a disdain for parental views following a decision by Brian Rogove, Cognita's former Asia Pacific CEO, to change the leadership of the school.In 2012, Cognita's director of education, Geraint Jones, was quoted as saying \"13 weeks' paid holiday is enough compensation for hard work during term time\" and that \"teachers have a duty to go beyond their classroom duties\", indicating that putting up wall displays, collecting dinner money, performing lunch duties and providing cover are vital tasks of the teaching job and should not be delegated to assistants. Jones also criticised the inefficiency of state schools, saying \"it makes me sick\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

He took over a team that lost 8 players from the most used starting lineup in 2019, and due to a strict economy Skeid only signed new players from 2. and 3. Division.\nThe season was put on a hold at the start of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and did not start until July, when it started with a reduced schedule. During the season, Skeid played homegames at 3 different venues due to problematic circumstances regarding the artificial turf at Nordre \u00c5sen.\nNonetheless, Holme led Skeid to a promotion playoff in his first season, witch the lost against Asker on penalties after both games ended 1-1.\nSkeid lost a couple of key players before the 2021 season when Idar Nordby Lysg\u00e5rd (Mj\u00f8ndalen), Henning T\u00f8nsberg Andresen (Ull/Kisa), Taofeek Ismaheel (Fredrikstad) and Hassan Yusuf (Grorud) all left the team, while legendary player Daniel Braathen hang up his boots after a great career.\nThe \u201dnew\u201d team started the season strong, and it looked like Skeid would challenge for promotion with Arendal and Egersund as their greatest rivals. Head coach Gard Holme also changed the formation from the previous year and played more of a 3-4-3 / 3-5-2-formation this season.\nTop scorer Johnny Buduson got injured midway through the season, and Holme chose to play youngster Abel Stensrud at his spot for the rest of the season. That turned out to be a great choice, as Stensrud scoret 19 goals on the last 12 games and ended up top scorer in the division.\nIn the end of October Skeid clinched promotion back to the OBOS-ligaen (Division 1) after a 12-0-win over Rosenborg 2 in front of over 800 people in the crowd at Nordre \u00c5sen. It had been a tough season with both Egersund and Arendal fighting for promotion, but in the end Skeid ended up on top.\nSkeid started the year of 2022 rough as top scorer Abel Stensrud and Simen Hestnes both left the team when their contracts expired, and they signed for Odd and KFUM Oslo shortly after. Head Coach Holme brought in Bendik Rise (H\u00f8dd), Morten Ren\u00e5 Olsen (Str\u00f8mmen) and Sulayman Bojang (FK Haugesund) to the during the winter.\nSkeid started the season badly, and halfway through the season Skeid was on 15.place in the table with only Stj\u00f8rdals-Blink behind them and Grorud a couple of points in front of them. During the summer break Skeid brought in a couple of players on loan: Kristoffer Hoven (Sogndal) and Simen Kvia-Egeskog (Viking) where both loaned in, while Maxwell Effiom (Sandnes Ulf) and Per-Magnus Steiring (Kongsvinger) signed on, Effiom for two years while Steiring signed on for the remainder of the season.\nAfter the summer break, things turned for Skeid, and they got 22 points from the remaining games, and ended the season on 14.place, witch meant relegation playoff against Arendal from division 2. Skeid went on to beat Arendal 6-0 at home and 2-1 away to remain in OBOS-ligaen another year.\nDuring the winter break before the 2023 season Skeid again lost a couple of key players when captain Fredrik Berglie departed for Sandefjord while young talent Jakob Napoleon Romsaas departed for Troms\u00f8 up north. Skeid brought in Fredrik Flo (Sandefjord) and Torje Naustdal (FK Haugesund) to bolster the squad, while Kristoffer Hoven and Per Magnus Steiring both signed two year deals the 2022 season concluded.

It emerged from his 1973 Mujama al-Islamiya Islamic charity affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian legislative election by campaigning on clean government without corruption, combined with affirmation of Palestinians\u2019 right to armed struggle against the Israeli occupation, thus winning a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council. In 2007, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip from rival Palestinian faction Fatah, which it has governed since separately from the Palestinian National Authority. This was followed by an Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip with Egyptian support, and multiple wars with Israel, including in 2008\u201309, 2012, 2014, and 2021. The ongoing 2023 war began after Hamas launched an attack, killing both civilians and soldiers, and taking hostages back to Gaza. The attack has been described as the biggest military setback for Israel since the 1973 Arab\u2013Israeli War, which Israel has responded to in an ongoing ground invasion of Gaza.Hamas promotes Palestinian nationalism in an Islamic context. While initially seeking a state in all of Mandatory Palestine, Hamas began acquiescing to 1967 borders in the agreements it signed with Fatah in 2005, 2006 and 2007 In 2017, Hamas released a new charter that supported a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders without recognizing Israel. Hamas's repeated offers of a truce (for a period of 10\u2013100 years) based on the 1967 borders are seen by many as consistent with a two-state solution. Others say that Hamas retains the long-term objective of establishing one state in former Mandatory Palestine. The 1988 Hamas charter was widely described as antisemitic. The revised 2017 Hamas Charter stated that Hamas's struggle was with Zionists, not Jews.Hamas has carried out attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians, including suicide bombings and indiscriminate rocket attacks. These actions have led human rights groups to accuse it of war crimes.
