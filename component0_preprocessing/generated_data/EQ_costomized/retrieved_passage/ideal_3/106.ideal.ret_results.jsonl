{"id": "106_1", "question": "What kind of work does Epicurus do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_36447", "text": "Epicurus (, EH-pih-KURE-\u0259s; Greek: \u1f18\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 Epikouros; 341\u2013270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and sage who founded Epicureanism, a highly influential school of philosophy. He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as \"the Garden\", in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects. He openly allowed women and slaves to join the school as a matter of policy. Of the over 300 works said to have been written by Epicurus about various subjects, the vast majority have been destroyed. Only three letters written by him\u2014the letters to Menoeceus, Pythocles, and Herodotus\u2014and two collections of quotes\u2014the Principal Doctrines and the Vatican Sayings\u2014have survived intact, along with a few fragments of his other writings. As a result of his work's destruction, most knowledge about his philosophy is due to later authors, particularly the biographer Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, the Epicurean Roman poet Lucretius and the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus, as well as the hostile but largely accurate accounts by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and the Academic Skeptic and statesman Cicero.\nEpicurus asserted that philosophy's purpose is to attain as well as to help others attain happy (eudaimonic), tranquil lives characterized by ataraxia (peace and freedom from fear) and aponia (the absence of pain). He advocated that people were best able to pursue philosophy by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that the root of all human neuroses is denial of death and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. According to Epicurus, death is the end of both the body and the soul and therefore should not be feared. Epicurus taught that although the gods exist, they have no involvement in human affairs. He taught that people should act ethically not because the gods punish or reward them for their actions but because, due to the power of guilt, amoral behavior would inevitably lead to remorse weighing on their consciences and as a result, they would be prevented from attaining ataraxia. \nEpicurus derived much of his physics and cosmology from the earlier philosopher Democritus (c. 460\u2013c. 370 BC). Like Democritus, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal and that all matter is made up of extremely tiny, invisible particles known as atoms. All occurrences in the natural world are ultimately the result of atoms moving and interacting in empty space. Epicurus deviated from Democritus by proposing the idea of atomic \"swerve\", which holds that atoms may deviate from their expected course, thus permitting humans to possess free will in an otherwise deterministic universe.\nThough popular, Epicurean teachings were controversial from the beginning. Epicureanism reached the height of its popularity during the late years of the Roman Republic. It died out in late antiquity, subject to hostility from early Christianity. Throughout the Middle Ages Epicurus was popularly, though inaccurately, remembered as a patron of drunkards, whoremongers, and gluttons. His teachings gradually became more widely known in the fifteenth century with the rediscovery of important texts, but his ideas did not become acceptable until the seventeenth century, when the French Catholic priest Pierre Gassendi revived a modified version of them, which was promoted by other writers, including Walter Charleton and Robert Boyle. His influence grew considerably during and after the Enlightenment, profoundly impacting the ideas of major thinkers, including John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Jeremy Bentham, and Karl Marx.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Born in Kilkenny, Ireland, O'Reily studied for the priesthood in Dublin.  Upon his ordination in 1869, he migrated to Western Australia, serving as a parish priest in Fremantle, and founding a Catholic newspaper there.  When the Diocese of Port Augusta was established in 1887, Pope Leo XIII named O'Reily as its first bishop.  Concerned about the financial position of the diocese (which had inherited significant debt from the Diocese of Adelaide), he accepted the posting reluctantly.  As bishop, he greatly improved the financial position of the new diocese, reducing its debt by half and earning a reputation as a competent administrator.\nIn 1894, O'Reily was appointed to replace the deceased Christopher Reynolds as Archbishop of Adelaide.  The archdiocese he inherited was burdened with substantial debt, again left over from the old Diocese of Adelaide. Through the sale of church assets and a fundraising campaign, O'Reily was able to eliminate most of the Archdiocese's liabilities while still investing in church infrastructure.  He also actively participated in public discussions relating to education policy at a time when the role of the state in supporting religious education was topical.  O'Reily publicly advocated government assistance for religious schools, stating that it was unfair Catholics paid taxes to support state schools, but received no funding for their own.  In the later years of his life, poor health forced him to spend less time attending to his episcopal duties, and from 1905, he largely retreated from public life.  At his request, Robert Spence was appointed as his coadjutor and successor in 1914, and on 6 July 1915, he died at his house in Adelaide.  O'Reily was highly regarded by many in South Australian society, with Adelaide's daily newspapers praising his character, administrative ability and positive relations with non-Catholics.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "106_36545", "text": "O'Reily was born John O'Reilly on 19 November 1846, in Kilkenny, Ireland, the son of Michael, a military officer, and Anne, n\u00e9e Gallagher. He completed his primary education at the parochial school of St. John's Parish, and spent six and a half years at St Kieran's College. Due to poor health, he decided against pursuing a military career, and in 1864 he entered All Hallows College in Dublin to study for the priesthood. He learnt Irish, and studied mental philosophy, mathematics and ecclesiastical studies, achieving first prize in each of his classes. After being ordained on 21 June 1869, he left Ireland for Western Australia in October, arriving in January 1870. Having served briefly in Newcastle (present day Toodyay) and Northam, he became a parish priest in Fremantle, establishing the West Australian Catholic Record in 1874 and serving as its publisher, editor and printer from 1883.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_36546", "text": "Following a recommendation from the first plenary council of Australia and New Zealand in 1885, in May 1887 Pope Leo XIII elevated the Diocese of Adelaide to an Archdiocese and metropolitan see.  As a suffragan diocese to Adelaide, the Pope established the rural Diocese of Port Pirie, naming O'Reilly as its inaugural bishop. Upon his appointment, O'Reilly travelled to Adelaide, where he met with the Archbishop of Adelaide Christopher Reynolds and the Cardinal of Sydney Patrick Moran to discuss the formation of the new diocese.  The poor financial state of the Archdiocese made the discussions contentious, with O'Reilly concerned about the amount of debt Port Augusta would inherit from Adelaide. To ensure a sufficiently large population for the new diocese, Moran suggested that its boundaries be altered from those drawn up by the Pope, but Reynolds opposed this plan. Dissatisfied with the outcome of the discussions, O'Reilly decided to travel to Sydney to deliberate further with the Cardinal, prompting Reynolds to write to Moran:\n\n\"If the Holy See would think well of giving the entire colony of South Australia to the care of Dr O'Reily,[sic] I would offer no opposition to it and would gladly enter a monastery and spend my few remaining years in preparation for the end!\"\nOn 27 October, O'Reilly wrote to Pope Leo XIII requesting permission to reverse his decision to accept the appointment to Port Augusta, believing he would be unable to administer a diocese with such significant debt and such a small, impoverished population.  In addition, he wrote, he had no personal wealth to contribute to the finances of the diocese. The concerns O'Reilly raised prompted Cardinal Simeoni of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith to call for an official church inquiry into the financial situation of the South Australian dioceses. The report found a total of almost \u00a338,000 of debt, with the new Port Augusta diocese bearing \u00a318,000. Following the report, O'Reilly's request was refused, and on 1 May 1888, he was consecrated in St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. Later that year, in an effort to save time while signing documents, O'Reilly removed an \"l\" from his surname.Although the Sisters of St. Joseph operated eight primary schools in the Diocese of Port Augusta, it was without a Catholic high school\u2014boarding or otherwise.  Accordingly, while he was staying in Sydney for his consecration, O'Reily sought to establish a convent for the Sydney-based Sisters of the Good Samaritan in Port Pirie.  At the bishop's expense, the order's Mother-General spent two months in Port Pirie, and once she had found appropriate living quarters, a school was established, teaching over 100 students.  A convent for the sisters was completed in 1890 on the same block as the school.Upon his return to South Australia, O'Reily immediately set about improving the financial situation of the Diocese of Port Augusta. He requested financial assistance from the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, and divided the diocese into fund-raising districts, campaigning for contributions in each of them. With the permission of Archbishop Thomas Carr in Melbourne, O'Reily toured parishes in Victoria asking for funds for his new diocese. By 1893, he had reduced the diocesan debt by half, with his peers describing him as a \"practical, clear-headed man of business\" due to his administrative ability.While Bishop of Port Augusta, O'Reily showed an interest in education policy. He authored a pastoral letter on the matter in March 1889, and the next year gave a speech criticising the lack of government funding for Catholic schools.

Due to poor health, he decided against pursuing a military career, and in 1864 he entered All Hallows College in Dublin to study for the priesthood. He learnt Irish, and studied mental philosophy, mathematics and ecclesiastical studies, achieving first prize in each of his classes. After being ordained on 21 June 1869, he left Ireland for Western Australia in October, arriving in January 1870. Having served briefly in Newcastle (present day Toodyay) and Northam, he became a parish priest in Fremantle, establishing the West Australian Catholic Record in 1874 and serving as its publisher, editor and printer from 1883.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_36546", "text": "Following a recommendation from the first plenary council of Australia and New Zealand in 1885, in May 1887 Pope Leo XIII elevated the Diocese of Adelaide to an Archdiocese and metropolitan see.  As a suffragan diocese to Adelaide, the Pope established the rural Diocese of Port Pirie, naming O'Reilly as its inaugural bishop. Upon his appointment, O'Reilly travelled to Adelaide, where he met with the Archbishop of Adelaide Christopher Reynolds and the Cardinal of Sydney Patrick Moran to discuss the formation of the new diocese.  The poor financial state of the Archdiocese made the discussions contentious, with O'Reilly concerned about the amount of debt Port Augusta would inherit from Adelaide. To ensure a sufficiently large population for the new diocese, Moran suggested that its boundaries be altered from those drawn up by the Pope, but Reynolds opposed this plan. Dissatisfied with the outcome of the discussions, O'Reilly decided to travel to Sydney to deliberate further with the Cardinal, prompting Reynolds to write to Moran:\n\n\"If the Holy See would think well of giving the entire colony of South Australia to the care of Dr O'Reily,[sic] I would offer no opposition to it and would gladly enter a monastery and spend my few remaining years in preparation for the end!\"\nOn 27 October, O'Reilly wrote to Pope Leo XIII requesting permission to reverse his decision to accept the appointment to Port Augusta, believing he would be unable to administer a diocese with such significant debt and such a small, impoverished population.  In addition, he wrote, he had no personal wealth to contribute to the finances of the diocese. The concerns O'Reilly raised prompted Cardinal Simeoni of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith to call for an official church inquiry into the financial situation of the South Australian dioceses. The report found a total of almost \u00a338,000 of debt, with the new Port Augusta diocese bearing \u00a318,000. Following the report, O'Reilly's request was refused, and on 1 May 1888, he was consecrated in St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. Later that year, in an effort to save time while signing documents, O'Reilly removed an \"l\" from his surname.Although the Sisters of St. Joseph operated eight primary schools in the Diocese of Port Augusta, it was without a Catholic high school\u2014boarding or otherwise.  Accordingly, while he was staying in Sydney for his consecration, O'Reily sought to establish a convent for the Sydney-based Sisters of the Good Samaritan in Port Pirie.  At the bishop's expense, the order's Mother-General spent two months in Port Pirie, and once she had found appropriate living quarters, a school was established, teaching over 100 students.  A convent for the sisters was completed in 1890 on the same block as the school.Upon his return to South Australia, O'Reily immediately set about improving the financial situation of the Diocese of Port Augusta. He requested financial assistance from the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, and divided the diocese into fund-raising districts, campaigning for contributions in each of them. With the permission of Archbishop Thomas Carr in Melbourne, O'Reily toured parishes in Victoria asking for funds for his new diocese. By 1893, he had reduced the diocesan debt by half, with his peers describing him as a \"practical, clear-headed man of business\" due to his administrative ability.While Bishop of Port Augusta, O'Reily showed an interest in education policy. He authored a pastoral letter on the matter in March 1889, and the next year gave a speech criticising the lack of government funding for Catholic schools.

He was the seventh and youngest child of Emery and Loretto (n\u00e9e Quirk) Comartin. His older siblings were Lucille, Agnes, Rosemary, Alice, Kathleen, and Edward. Emery was a French American born in North Dakota. Emery wandered the Midwestern United States during the Great Depression, eventually settling in Detroit after getting a job there as an autoworker. Loretto was an Irish Canadian from London, Ontario who moved to Detroit to care for her sick aunt. The two met through Detroit's Irish American community and married. Emery continued to work in Detroit, but the family also purchased a plot of land to farm in Stoney Point.Emery died of stomach cancer when Joe was a year old and when Loretto was pregnant with an eighth child, who was named Emery after his father. Following the senior Emery's death, Loretto began teaching at an elementary school to supplement meager social assistance, financial support from family, and charity from the local community. She later remarried to Adelard Gagnon, a car salesman from Belle River, Ontario.Comartin developed an early love for reading as a child, and he often read while in the branches of an apple tree. During his education he often had to work two or three jobs at a time to help support his family, with his first job being at a grocery store in Belle River. Comartin attended F.J. Brennan Catholic High School in Windsor, Ontario. At his mother's urging Comartin originally intended to become a priest, but at 16 he decided that he did not want to be celibate. Instead, he decided he wanted to become a lawyer, believing it to be a similar form of public service. While at Brennan, Comartin was elected the eleventh grade male representative on the student council. He was appointed as the male representative on the school's awards committee after the twelfth grade male representative proved unable to fill the role. The twelfth grade female representative was Comartin's future wife, Maureen Granger. Granger was already in a relationship at the time, and she and Comartin did not begin dating until a few years later. Comartin was elected student president in his final year at Brennan.Following his high school graduation Comartin attended the University of Windsor, where he completed an undergraduate in political science in 1968, and law school in 1971. Unlike most of his older siblings, Comartin was able to attend university because of the creation of the Canada Student Loan Program. While at university Comartin was an engaged student activist; he attended a student strike where he briefly met then-Member of Provincial Parliament Hugh Peacock, and was a founding member of the Windsor chapter of the Canadian Environmental Law Association.Two years after completing law school, Comartin established a private legal practice in Windsor. During this time, he specialised in civil litigation and representing low-income women in family law cases. In the late 1970s, Comartin sued brake manufacturer Bendix on behalf of widow Lucie Dunn to have her husband's death by mesothelioma recognised as a compensable injury.In 1984, Comartin left his private legal practice to become a lawyer for the Windsor branch of the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) and the managing director of its legal services.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_36569", "text": "The Comartin family had traditionally supported the Liberal Party, especially prominent local member Paul Martin Sr. At the encouragement of his sister, Comartin joined the Liberal Party and campaigned for her friend Mark MacGuigan in the 1968 Canadian federal election, in which Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was elected for the first time. Despite his initial support, Comartin quickly grew to dislike Trudeau for his arrogance, and he switched parties to the NDP the next year after concluding they better aligned with his values. Comartin went on to become heavily involved with the regional riding associations of the NDP and Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP).\nIn 1981, Comartin was appointed co-chair of the Mayor's Committee on Services for the Unemployed by Bert Weeks.Following Weeks' retirement, Comartin worked as the campaign manager for Elizabeth Kishkon's successful bid to succeed him in the 1982 Windsor municipal election. Comartin also campaigned for city alderman Howard McCurdy's successful bid to be elected MP for Windsor\u2014Walkerville in the 1984 Canadian federal election. After McCurdy's election, there was a controversy over whether his replacement as city alderman would be appointed or if a by-election would be held. Comartin was considered a contender to replace McCurdy, but ultimately former mayor Michael J. Patrick was appointed instead. Comartin was the ONDP campaign manager for Windsor\u2014Walkerville in 1985 and 1987, working on behalf of unsuccessful candidates Gary Parent and Donna Champagne.While otherwise a supporter, Comartin was highly critical of Leader of the NDP Ed Broadbent's conduct in the 1988 Canadian federal election. Comartin believed that Broadbent had unwisely focused on nationwide campaigning rather than targeting winnable ridings. Comartin also believed that Broadbent had failed to capitalise on the NDP's traditionally protectionist trade policy amidst widespread opposition to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, which the Liberals had made a major campaign issue. Local NDP MPs Howard McCurdy and Steven Langdon both agreed with Comartin's assessment. Broadbent chose to resign as Leader shortly after the election, and both McCurdy and Langdon ran to replace him in the 1989 New Democratic Party leadership election. McCurdy and Langdon's rivalry as leadership candidates was exacerbated by the fact that they came from neighbouring ridings and had to compete for support in their home county. Comartin supported McCurdy, who made a surprisingly poor showing of fifth place on the first ballot of the leadership convention. On the second ballot, McCurdy withdrew and endorsed Langdon. Following McCurdy's withdrawal Comartin supported Langdon, even after McCurdy changed his endorsement to Audrey McLaughlin, the eventual winner, on the third ballot.In the lead-up to the 1990 Ontario general election, Donna Champagne surprisingly chose not to run again. Champagne endorsed the relatively unknown Wayne Lessard, who became the ONDP nominee in Windsor\u2014Walkerville in her stead. Comartin campaigned for Lessard, but was out of the country for part of the election season. Before leaving the country, Comartin predicted that the ONDP would do about as well as it had in the previous election, and expected the party to win about 17 seats in the Legislative Assembly. After returning to Canada, Comartin found that support for the party had surged, and the ONDP went on to form government for the first time in Ontarian history. Leader of the ONDP Bob Rae became Premier of Ontario. In Windsor\u2014Walkerville, Lessard defeated Liberal incumbent Mike Ray.\nComartin declined to run for mayor in the 1991 Windsor municipal election.In 1992, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made his second attempt at constitutional reform, known as the Charlottetown Accord. Approval of the Accord was subject to a nationwide referendum, with Canada's three major parties, the Progressive Conservatives, the Liberals, and the New Democrats all supporting its ratification. Comartin was made campaign manager for the 'Yes' campaign in Windsor, and directed all three parties' riding associations in the area. Despite massive institutional support, Windsor voted against ratifying the Accord by a nearly two-to-one margin.Comartin did a great deal of lobbying on behalf of Windsor's unions to convince the Rae Government to build Ontario's first casino in Windsor. Comartin's efforts were supported by Dave Cooke, a fellow Windsorite and a senior member of Rae's cabinet. The lobbying was a success, resulting in the eventual construction of Caesars Windsor. Comartin was appointed to the Ontario Casino Corporation (OCC) board of directors in 1993.Rae's ONDP government was defeated in a landslide in the 1995 Ontario general election by the Progressive Conservatives, led by Mike Harris. Shortly after being elected, the Harris Government removed Comartin from his position on the board of the OCC before his term had expired, which was widely seen as politically motivated. The removal caused an uproar in Windsor, as it deprived the city of any representation on the board of the OCC despite having (at the time) the only casino in the province.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_36568", "text": "Joseph John \"Joe\" Comartin was born on December 26, 1947, in Stoney Point, Ontario, a small Franco-Ontarian community.

She later remarried to Adelard Gagnon, a car salesman from Belle River, Ontario.Comartin developed an early love for reading as a child, and he often read while in the branches of an apple tree. During his education he often had to work two or three jobs at a time to help support his family, with his first job being at a grocery store in Belle River. Comartin attended F.J. Brennan Catholic High School in Windsor, Ontario. At his mother's urging Comartin originally intended to become a priest, but at 16 he decided that he did not want to be celibate. Instead, he decided he wanted to become a lawyer, believing it to be a similar form of public service. While at Brennan, Comartin was elected the eleventh grade male representative on the student council. He was appointed as the male representative on the school's awards committee after the twelfth grade male representative proved unable to fill the role. The twelfth grade female representative was Comartin's future wife, Maureen Granger. Granger was already in a relationship at the time, and she and Comartin did not begin dating until a few years later. Comartin was elected student president in his final year at Brennan.Following his high school graduation Comartin attended the University of Windsor, where he completed an undergraduate in political science in 1968, and law school in 1971. Unlike most of his older siblings, Comartin was able to attend university because of the creation of the Canada Student Loan Program. While at university Comartin was an engaged student activist; he attended a student strike where he briefly met then-Member of Provincial Parliament Hugh Peacock, and was a founding member of the Windsor chapter of the Canadian Environmental Law Association.Two years after completing law school, Comartin established a private legal practice in Windsor. During this time, he specialised in civil litigation and representing low-income women in family law cases. In the late 1970s, Comartin sued brake manufacturer Bendix on behalf of widow Lucie Dunn to have her husband's death by mesothelioma recognised as a compensable injury.In 1984, Comartin left his private legal practice to become a lawyer for the Windsor branch of the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) and the managing director of its legal services.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_36569", "text": "The Comartin family had traditionally supported the Liberal Party, especially prominent local member Paul Martin Sr. At the encouragement of his sister, Comartin joined the Liberal Party and campaigned for her friend Mark MacGuigan in the 1968 Canadian federal election, in which Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was elected for the first time. Despite his initial support, Comartin quickly grew to dislike Trudeau for his arrogance, and he switched parties to the NDP the next year after concluding they better aligned with his values. Comartin went on to become heavily involved with the regional riding associations of the NDP and Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP).\nIn 1981, Comartin was appointed co-chair of the Mayor's Committee on Services for the Unemployed by Bert Weeks.Following Weeks' retirement, Comartin worked as the campaign manager for Elizabeth Kishkon's successful bid to succeed him in the 1982 Windsor municipal election. Comartin also campaigned for city alderman Howard McCurdy's successful bid to be elected MP for Windsor\u2014Walkerville in the 1984 Canadian federal election. After McCurdy's election, there was a controversy over whether his replacement as city alderman would be appointed or if a by-election would be held. Comartin was considered a contender to replace McCurdy, but ultimately former mayor Michael J. Patrick was appointed instead. Comartin was the ONDP campaign manager for Windsor\u2014Walkerville in 1985 and 1987, working on behalf of unsuccessful candidates Gary Parent and Donna Champagne.While otherwise a supporter, Comartin was highly critical of Leader of the NDP Ed Broadbent's conduct in the 1988 Canadian federal election. Comartin believed that Broadbent had unwisely focused on nationwide campaigning rather than targeting winnable ridings. Comartin also believed that Broadbent had failed to capitalise on the NDP's traditionally protectionist trade policy amidst widespread opposition to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, which the Liberals had made a major campaign issue. Local NDP MPs Howard McCurdy and Steven Langdon both agreed with Comartin's assessment. Broadbent chose to resign as Leader shortly after the election, and both McCurdy and Langdon ran to replace him in the 1989 New Democratic Party leadership election. McCurdy and Langdon's rivalry as leadership candidates was exacerbated by the fact that they came from neighbouring ridings and had to compete for support in their home county. Comartin supported McCurdy, who made a surprisingly poor showing of fifth place on the first ballot of the leadership convention. On the second ballot, McCurdy withdrew and endorsed Langdon. Following McCurdy's withdrawal Comartin supported Langdon, even after McCurdy changed his endorsement to Audrey McLaughlin, the eventual winner, on the third ballot.In the lead-up to the 1990 Ontario general election, Donna Champagne surprisingly chose not to run again. Champagne endorsed the relatively unknown Wayne Lessard, who became the ONDP nominee in Windsor\u2014Walkerville in her stead. Comartin campaigned for Lessard, but was out of the country for part of the election season. Before leaving the country, Comartin predicted that the ONDP would do about as well as it had in the previous election, and expected the party to win about 17 seats in the Legislative Assembly. After returning to Canada, Comartin found that support for the party had surged, and the ONDP went on to form government for the first time in Ontarian history. Leader of the ONDP Bob Rae became Premier of Ontario. In Windsor\u2014Walkerville, Lessard defeated Liberal incumbent Mike Ray.\nComartin declined to run for mayor in the 1991 Windsor municipal election.In 1992, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made his second attempt at constitutional reform, known as the Charlottetown Accord. Approval of the Accord was subject to a nationwide referendum, with Canada's three major parties, the Progressive Conservatives, the Liberals, and the New Democrats all supporting its ratification. Comartin was made campaign manager for the 'Yes' campaign in Windsor, and directed all three parties' riding associations in the area. Despite massive institutional support, Windsor voted against ratifying the Accord by a nearly two-to-one margin.Comartin did a great deal of lobbying on behalf of Windsor's unions to convince the Rae Government to build Ontario's first casino in Windsor. Comartin's efforts were supported by Dave Cooke, a fellow Windsorite and a senior member of Rae's cabinet. The lobbying was a success, resulting in the eventual construction of Caesars Windsor. Comartin was appointed to the Ontario Casino Corporation (OCC) board of directors in 1993.Rae's ONDP government was defeated in a landslide in the 1995 Ontario general election by the Progressive Conservatives, led by Mike Harris. Shortly after being elected, the Harris Government removed Comartin from his position on the board of the OCC before his term had expired, which was widely seen as politically motivated. The removal caused an uproar in Windsor, as it deprived the city of any representation on the board of the OCC despite having (at the time) the only casino in the province.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is best known as the creator of musical revues and operettas, such as The White Horse Inn (Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl) and The Congress Dances (Der Kongress tanzt).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "106_36601", "text": "Charell was born as Erich Karl L\u00f6wenberg in Breslau. He was the first child of Jewish parents Markus L\u00f6wenberg and Ida Korach. He also had a sister, Betti, who was born in 1886, and a younger brother named Ludwig, who was born in 1889 and later became Charell's manager.\nCharell studied dance in Berlin. He was discovered, according to his own account, by the press in 1913 during a performance of the ballet-pantomime Venezianische Abenteuer eines jungen Mannes by playwright Karl Vollm\u00f6ller in a production of director Max Reinhardt at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. He founded his own company, the Charell-Ballett, and toured Europe during and after the World War I. The musical director of his company was the young Friedrich Hollaender (later a famous film composer.) In two silent movies, Paul Leni's Prince Cuckoo (1919) and Richard Oswald's Figures of the Night (1920) he demonstrated his brilliance as an actor. Reinhardt appointed Charell as assistant stage manager for the tour production of Vollm\u00f6ller's The Miracle in New York in 1923. After his return to Germany in 1924, Charell and his brother Ludwig were offered to take over the management of the Gro\u00dfes Schauspielhaus in Berlin, which belonged to Reinhardt's theatre empire, the so called Reinhardt B\u00fchnen.\nIn 1924 Charell presented his first revue, An Alle. He managed to engage the \"Tiller Girls\", an internationally famous girl group from London. His aim was to mix German operetta with exotic ingredients such as jazz, \"negro music\" and \"the most enchanting Dancing-Girls with divine legs\", in order to show that revue made in Berlin could be \"as contemporary as the jazz band, that turns the Siegmund-jodeling and Siegfried-screaching to laughter\" and is \"as modern as Mozart or the mini-automobile\", as Charell's personal friend and PR genius Alfred Flechtheim phrased it in the 1924 article \"Vom Ballet zur Revue\" in the magazine Der Querschnitt. \"Charell wants us to witness the many different facets from all around the world\".This show was followed by the revues F\u00fcr Dich (1925) and Von Mund zu Mund (1926), which were arranged by composer Ralph Benatzky and contained music by Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern and many others.\nAfter the series of revues, Charell began adapting classic operettas such as The Mikado, Wie einst im Mai, Madame Pompadour and Die lustige Witwe and turned them into modern jazzy revue operettas, claiming that he needed a plot line for his show, that had been missing in the pure revues before. A few years later, he decided to create his very own operettas with composer Ralph Benatzky. Together they wrote the trilogy of historical revue-operettas, which made Charell famous to this day: Casanova (1928), Die drei Musketiere (1929) and The White Horse Inn (Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6\u00dfl, 1930). Especially The White Horse Inn was one of the most successful creations of Charell's career. In the following years he himself staged the show in London (1931), Paris (1932) and New York (1936), where each production was newly conceived, the script translated differently, and new music and instrumentation were added in some parts.\nMany actors and singers, such as Marlene Dietrich, Joseph Schmidt, Max Hansen and Camilla Spira, who all became famous later, first appeared in major roles in Charell productions. Charell also discovered the boy group Comedian Harmonists and presented them for the first time in Casanova at the Gro\u00dfe Schauspielhaus. The reaction of the international press was positive, the New York Times noting that \"Erik Charell seems to have done it again. 'Casanova', his latest operetta production at the Grosses Schauspielhaus, is filling this huge circus to its stylized rafters\". \nAfter this string of stage successes, Charell moved on to the new and innovative genre of sound film operetta. In 1931, Universum Film AG (Ufa) producer Erich Pommer invited Charell to direct Der Kongre\u00df tanzt, (sets by Ernst Stern, music by Werner Richard Heymann), one of the most successful films of the early era of sound film, with one review in the New York Times saying that \"[it] is a stupendous pictorial film. [...] it is [...] an exceptional film entertainment. The director, Erik Charell, is the Ziegfeld of the German musical comedy stage\" and another noting that \"It is a charming spectacle of Vienna in 1814, filled with tuneful melodies that one likes to remember and blessed with pleasing light comedy\". The international success of Der Kongre\u00df tanzt led to an engagement in Hollywood, where Charell directed the movie Caravan, again with sets by Ernst Stern and music by Werner Richard Heymann.\nWhen the Nazis took over in January 1933, the Ufa immediately annulled their contract with Charell because of his Jewish descent. They also cancelled all plans for two further contractually agreed upon film projects, one a film operetta based on the Odyssey with Hans Albers in the male lead. Three years later a German court even sentenced Charell to return the 26.000 Reichsmark, which had been paid to him as an advance.\nWhen Caravan flopped in the US and internationally, his Hollywood career and all other American film projects came to an immediate halt. The New York Times noted \"If lyric loveliness and photographic charm were all a picture needed to keep an audience enthralled, Mr. Charell could be toasted in good tokay this morning, and 'Caravan' could be applauded until the bottle is dry. But the sober fact is that the new film is an exceptionally tedious enterprise\". One of the cancelled projects was a film about ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). It would have been an interesting project, since Charell in his dancing days was often compared by the German press to Nijinsky.\nIn 1936, Charell staged a successful Broadway production of White Horse Inn. The New York Times noted that it \"involves mountain scenery and hotel architecture, costumes beautiful and varied enough to bankrupt a designer's imagination, choruses that can do anything from the hornpipe to a resounding slap-dance, grand processionals with royalty loitering before the commoners, a steamboat, a yacht, a char-\u00e0-banc, four real cows and a great deal more of the same. Indeed, the enthusiasm with which 'White Horse Inn' has been created has virtually transformed the enormous Center Theatre into a Tyrol village\". The Daily Mirror mentioned that \"it is difficult to give you an idea of the immensity of 'White Horse Inn'. It is gargantuan. It is the Queen Mary of extravaganzas. [...] It boasts acres of settings, hundreds of performers. It is a grand and glittering sight for the eyes.\" There was even talk of a film version with Eddie Cantor as the head waiter. (Warner Brothers were co-producers of the Broadway staging.)\nSpurred by the success of White Horse Inn, Charell adapted Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream as a jazz operetta and presented it as Swinging the Dream on Broadway at the Center Theatre in 1939. It was a daring and innovative production, because Charell used only black actors and singers, including Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Maxine Sullivan, Moms Mabley, Dorothy Dandridge and Butterfly McQueen. Furthermore, the stage sets were based on Walt Disney motifs. Music was written for the production by Jimmy van Heusen but songs included in the show came from the greatest African-American composers and songwriters in jazz: W. C. Handy, Thomas \"Fats\" Waller, Count Basie and many others.Benny Goodman conducted his own sextet and the choreography was by Agnes de Mille. But the production closed after only 13 performances, mainly because white Broadway audiences (and, perhaps more importantly, racist reviewers) of the time were not \"ready\" for an all-black cast. A review in the New York Times described the show as a \"negro carnival\", noting that \"between Shakespeare and Goodman, Goodman wins\".  It's likely that the timing of the opening had a great deal to do with the lack of success of \"Swingin'\"; by opening night - 29 November 1939 - World War II was in full swing; it would have been difficult for audiences to enjoy an escapist musical fantasy while events in Europe were becoming more and more horrifying with every passing hour.  [A re-creation of the show was streamed online during the COVID-19 pandemic in a collaboration between the Royal Shakespeare Company and Young Vic of London, England and Theatre for a New Audience of New York, New York on 9 January 2021.]\nAfter the war, Charell returned to Europe. In Munich he had a big success with the musical comedy Feuerwerk (music by Paul Burkhard) at the Staatstheater am G\u00e4rtnerplatz. The song O mein Papa became an international hit. In the 1950s, Charell created a stage version of Der Kongre\u00df tanzt, which was performed in France, but the French public was not enthusiastic. His two big film productions were The White Horse Inn with Nazi operetta star Johannes Heesters in 1952, and Fireworks with Lilli Palmer and the young Romy Schneider in 1954.\nAfter failing to write a sequel to The White Horse Inn with his original librettist Robert Gilbert, Charell spend most of his time of the 1960s buying and selling art. Together with his brother Ludwig he owned a collection of Toulouse-Lautrec-lithographs, which was exhibited in Canada in 1953 and in other major museums of the world.\nIn 1969 he received the German movie prize, the Filmband in Gold, for his \"excellent works and outstanding contributions to the history of the German movie\".\nHe died on 15 July 1974 in Munich and was cremated on the Eastern cemetery. In his obituary it says: \"28 friends gave him the last farewell in the city, to which he had a special love. A movie producer spoke to his memories, and to honour this charmer, who consciously and prudently managed his graceful talents, the triumph march of Verdi's opera 'Aida' sounded across the cemetery\". The urn was interred in a cemetery in Gr\u00fcnwald near Munich. Charell's partner Friedrich Zanner and Dr. Wolf Schwarz, a lawyer and friend, were appointed to manage the estate and the personal property.His collection of Lautrec-lithographs was sold by Sotheby's in 1978.\nThe Schwules Museum Berlin dedicated an exhibition to Charell and his work from 7 July to 27 September 2010. It was curated by Kevin Clarke.\nOn 18 November 2015, Friedrichstadt-Palast Berlin inaugurated a memorial at Friedrichstra\u00dfe 107 dedicated to the theatre's founders, Max Reinhardt, Hans Poelzig and Erik Charell.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_36602", "text": "When Charell visited New York for the first time, working at the Century Theatre for Max Reinhardt, he was impressed and inspired by the American revues, especially the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway. He decided, upon his return to Berlin, to combine European operetta music with the music and ideas of the American music theatre, to create a more 'cosmopolitan German' style. He established a revue style in which \"word, sound, image, costume, colour, the art of illumination [work together] as a single rousing burning mirror\". Charell wanted to make \"modern\" pieces and bring them to Germany to challenge the conservative mindset, which still prevailed in Europe after the First World War (\"Germany is still suffering from the blockage. After being isolated from the rest of the world for ten years, it finally needs to breathe freely and realize what was going on in those ten long years, not only in science [...], but also in things, which take a look on the bright side of life\"). His way of using contemporary syncopated music \u2013 from the German charts and the USA (the first European performance of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue took place within Charell's first revue, An Alle) \u2013,the risqu\u00e9 jokes and the inclusion of attractive boy groups (dancing and singing) in addition to the then standard heterosexual display of female nudity were all new to the Berlin theatre scene. He also presented renowned Lesbian stars such as Claire Waldoff to draw in additional crowds.\nEspecially the sexually provocative sketches between the songs made his reviews and revue operettas famous. The comedians Claire Waldoff and Wilhelm Bendow were hired to perform slapstick and dialectic humour similar of the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Karl Valentin. They provided an ironic view on different topics and cheeky 'hidden' references to e.g. sex practices of heteros and homosexuals. Besides, there were also jokes about sexuality woven into the song texts by the lyricists. This made the heterosexual audience laugh, especially those who understood the insider jokes, and it especially catered to the homosexual crowd. Bendow was particularly famous for his camp acting and double entendres. Furthermore, on Charell used sexually suggestive imagery, like in Von Mund zu Mund in which ancient Roman soldiers were portrayed semi-naked holding lances and swords.Charell revolutionized the German musical theatre by developing the idea of 'staged nudity' further than had been standard until then. He discovered modern female chorus lines in New York and was the first to bring them to Berlin, where they fuelled his stunning success. When the other theatre managers tried to copy Charell and also hired female chorus groups, they presented them as nude as possible. While the fight over who had the 'most naked' women in Berlin was raging, Charell's staging of nudity moved into a wholly different direction: when the audience became tired and bored of a straightforward display of naked bodies (\"Yes, we are all pretty tired of those flesh exhibitions. The audience is sated with thighs. Not to mention, how fed up we are of the mass display of female bosoms.\"), he started to artfully arrange the nudity. Charell wanted \"to reawaken aesthetic feelings\" in the spectator \"by artistic composition\".\nIn addition and as a contrast to the omnipresent female nudity, Charell also hired boy groups, e.g. the Tyrolean dancers, the \"Schuhplattler and Watschent\u00e4nzer\", for Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl, or the \"Jackson\" and the \"Sunshine Boys\". In the first case homoeroticism is quite obvious, the tabloid newspaper BZ am Mittag noting \"juicy guys in leather trousers, who slap each other in time. [...] My God, they have the right cheeks for it!\"\nCharell also used famous male sex symbols in his operettas, like Alfred Jerger, Max Hansen and Siegfried Arno, the latter doing a famous striptease in The Three Musketeers when comparing his battle wounds with the others, critic Erich Urban noted that \"when [Arno] unveils his perforated body to Hansen [...] the whole theatre screams and gasp, not just the upper balconies\". Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl contains a similar scene, in which Arno presents himself as a \"gorgeous bathing beauty\" and undresses, before plunging into the Wolfgangsee.\nEven though Charell's revues were inspired by America and England, this kind of nudity and sexual liberation was only found in Berlin during the Roaring Twenties. After 1933, the Nazis suppressed such most of the sexual freedom in operetta, because it was seen as \"Jewish\" and \"degenerate\". Unfortunately, 1945 the German operetta scene never returned to the liberated ideals of the 1920s and adapted many of the famous shows from that era to fit the new 'innocent' style of the post-war period. This eventually led Charell to leave the theatre and film business entirely, and focus on his art collection instead.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_36601", "text": "Charell was born as Erich Karl L\u00f6wenberg in Breslau. He was the first child of Jewish parents Markus L\u00f6wenberg and Ida Korach. He also had a sister, Betti, who was born in 1886, and a younger brother named Ludwig, who was born in 1889 and later became Charell's manager.\nCharell studied dance in Berlin. He was discovered, according to his own account, by the press in 1913 during a performance of the ballet-pantomime Venezianische Abenteuer eines jungen Mannes by playwright Karl Vollm\u00f6ller in a production of director Max Reinhardt at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. He founded his own company, the Charell-Ballett, and toured Europe during and after the World War I. The musical director of his company was the young Friedrich Hollaender (later a famous film composer.) In two silent movies, Paul Leni's Prince Cuckoo (1919) and Richard Oswald's Figures of the Night (1920) he demonstrated his brilliance as an actor. Reinhardt appointed Charell as assistant stage manager for the tour production of Vollm\u00f6ller's The Miracle in New York in 1923. After his return to Germany in 1924, Charell and his brother Ludwig were offered to take over the management of the Gro\u00dfes Schauspielhaus in Berlin, which belonged to Reinhardt's theatre empire, the so called Reinhardt B\u00fchnen.\nIn 1924 Charell presented his first revue, An Alle. He managed to engage the \"Tiller Girls\", an internationally famous girl group from London. His aim was to mix German operetta with exotic ingredients such as jazz, \"negro music\" and \"the most enchanting Dancing-Girls with divine legs\", in order to show that revue made in Berlin could be \"as contemporary as the jazz band, that turns the Siegmund-jodeling and Siegfried-screaching to laughter\" and is \"as modern as Mozart or the mini-automobile\", as Charell's personal friend and PR genius Alfred Flechtheim phrased it in the 1924 article \"Vom Ballet zur Revue\" in the magazine Der Querschnitt. \"Charell wants us to witness the many different facets from all around the world\".This show was followed by the revues F\u00fcr Dich (1925) and Von Mund zu Mund (1926), which were arranged by composer Ralph Benatzky and contained music by Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern and many others.\nAfter the series of revues, Charell began adapting classic operettas such as The Mikado, Wie einst im Mai, Madame Pompadour and Die lustige Witwe and turned them into modern jazzy revue operettas, claiming that he needed a plot line for his show, that had been missing in the pure revues before. A few years later, he decided to create his very own operettas with composer Ralph Benatzky. Together they wrote the trilogy of historical revue-operettas, which made Charell famous to this day: Casanova (1928), Die drei Musketiere (1929) and The White Horse Inn (Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6\u00dfl, 1930). Especially The White Horse Inn was one of the most successful creations of Charell's career. In the following years he himself staged the show in London (1931), Paris (1932) and New York (1936), where each production was newly conceived, the script translated differently, and new music and instrumentation were added in some parts.\nMany actors and singers, such as Marlene Dietrich, Joseph Schmidt, Max Hansen and Camilla Spira, who all became famous later, first appeared in major roles in Charell productions. Charell also discovered the boy group Comedian Harmonists and presented them for the first time in Casanova at the Gro\u00dfe Schauspielhaus. The reaction of the international press was positive, the New York Times noting that \"Erik Charell seems to have done it again. 'Casanova', his latest operetta production at the Grosses Schauspielhaus, is filling this huge circus to its stylized rafters\". \nAfter this string of stage successes, Charell moved on to the new and innovative genre of sound film operetta. In 1931, Universum Film AG (Ufa) producer Erich Pommer invited Charell to direct Der Kongre\u00df tanzt, (sets by Ernst Stern, music by Werner Richard Heymann), one of the most successful films of the early era of sound film, with one review in the New York Times saying that \"[it] is a stupendous pictorial film. [...] it is [...] an exceptional film entertainment. The director, Erik Charell, is the Ziegfeld of the German musical comedy stage\" and another noting that \"It is a charming spectacle of Vienna in 1814, filled with tuneful melodies that one likes to remember and blessed with pleasing light comedy\". The international success of Der Kongre\u00df tanzt led to an engagement in Hollywood, where Charell directed the movie Caravan, again with sets by Ernst Stern and music by Werner Richard Heymann.\nWhen the Nazis took over in January 1933, the Ufa immediately annulled their contract with Charell because of his Jewish descent. They also cancelled all plans for two further contractually agreed upon film projects, one a film operetta based on the Odyssey with Hans Albers in the male lead. Three years later a German court even sentenced Charell to return the 26.000 Reichsmark, which had been paid to him as an advance.\nWhen Caravan flopped in the US and internationally, his Hollywood career and all other American film projects came to an immediate halt. The New York Times noted \"If lyric loveliness and photographic charm were all a picture needed to keep an audience enthralled, Mr. Charell could be toasted in good tokay this morning, and 'Caravan' could be applauded until the bottle is dry. But the sober fact is that the new film is an exceptionally tedious enterprise\". One of the cancelled projects was a film about ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). It would have been an interesting project, since Charell in his dancing days was often compared by the German press to Nijinsky.\nIn 1936, Charell staged a successful Broadway production of White Horse Inn. The New York Times noted that it \"involves mountain scenery and hotel architecture, costumes beautiful and varied enough to bankrupt a designer's imagination, choruses that can do anything from the hornpipe to a resounding slap-dance, grand processionals with royalty loitering before the commoners, a steamboat, a yacht, a char-\u00e0-banc, four real cows and a great deal more of the same. Indeed, the enthusiasm with which 'White Horse Inn' has been created has virtually transformed the enormous Center Theatre into a Tyrol village\". The Daily Mirror mentioned that \"it is difficult to give you an idea of the immensity of 'White Horse Inn'. It is gargantuan. It is the Queen Mary of extravaganzas. [...] It boasts acres of settings, hundreds of performers. It is a grand and glittering sight for the eyes.\" There was even talk of a film version with Eddie Cantor as the head waiter. (Warner Brothers were co-producers of the Broadway staging.)\nSpurred by the success of White Horse Inn, Charell adapted Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream as a jazz operetta and presented it as Swinging the Dream on Broadway at the Center Theatre in 1939. It was a daring and innovative production, because Charell used only black actors and singers, including Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Maxine Sullivan, Moms Mabley, Dorothy Dandridge and Butterfly McQueen. Furthermore, the stage sets were based on Walt Disney motifs. Music was written for the production by Jimmy van Heusen but songs included in the show came from the greatest African-American composers and songwriters in jazz: W. C. Handy, Thomas \"Fats\" Waller, Count Basie and many others.Benny Goodman conducted his own sextet and the choreography was by Agnes de Mille. But the production closed after only 13 performances, mainly because white Broadway audiences (and, perhaps more importantly, racist reviewers) of the time were not \"ready\" for an all-black cast. A review in the New York Times described the show as a \"negro carnival\", noting that \"between Shakespeare and Goodman, Goodman wins\".  It's likely that the timing of the opening had a great deal to do with the lack of success of \"Swingin'\"; by opening night - 29 November 1939 - World War II was in full swing; it would have been difficult for audiences to enjoy an escapist musical fantasy while events in Europe were becoming more and more horrifying with every passing hour.  [A re-creation of the show was streamed online during the COVID-19 pandemic in a collaboration between the Royal Shakespeare Company and Young Vic of London, England and Theatre for a New Audience of New York, New York on 9 January 2021.]\nAfter the war, Charell returned to Europe. In Munich he had a big success with the musical comedy Feuerwerk (music by Paul Burkhard) at the Staatstheater am G\u00e4rtnerplatz. The song O mein Papa became an international hit. In the 1950s, Charell created a stage version of Der Kongre\u00df tanzt, which was performed in France, but the French public was not enthusiastic. His two big film productions were The White Horse Inn with Nazi operetta star Johannes Heesters in 1952, and Fireworks with Lilli Palmer and the young Romy Schneider in 1954.\nAfter failing to write a sequel to The White Horse Inn with his original librettist Robert Gilbert, Charell spend most of his time of the 1960s buying and selling art. Together with his brother Ludwig he owned a collection of Toulouse-Lautrec-lithographs, which was exhibited in Canada in 1953 and in other major museums of the world.\nIn 1969 he received the German movie prize, the Filmband in Gold, for his \"excellent works and outstanding contributions to the history of the German movie\".\nHe died on 15 July 1974 in Munich and was cremated on the Eastern cemetery. In his obituary it says: \"28 friends gave him the last farewell in the city, to which he had a special love. A movie producer spoke to his memories, and to honour this charmer, who consciously and prudently managed his graceful talents, the triumph march of Verdi's opera 'Aida' sounded across the cemetery\". The urn was interred in a cemetery in Gr\u00fcnwald near Munich. Charell's partner Friedrich Zanner and Dr. Wolf Schwarz, a lawyer and friend, were appointed to manage the estate and the personal property.His collection of Lautrec-lithographs was sold by Sotheby's in 1978.\nThe Schwules Museum Berlin dedicated an exhibition to Charell and his work from 7 July to 27 September 2010. It was curated by Kevin Clarke.\nOn 18 November 2015, Friedrichstadt-Palast Berlin inaugurated a memorial at Friedrichstra\u00dfe 107 dedicated to the theatre's founders, Max Reinhardt, Hans Poelzig and Erik Charell.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_36602", "text": "When Charell visited New York for the first time, working at the Century Theatre for Max Reinhardt, he was impressed and inspired by the American revues, especially the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway.

He established a revue style in which \"word, sound, image, costume, colour, the art of illumination [work together] as a single rousing burning mirror\". Charell wanted to make \"modern\" pieces and bring them to Germany to challenge the conservative mindset, which still prevailed in Europe after the First World War (\"Germany is still suffering from the blockage.

It is possible that he was the son of the nephew of the Count of Brittany, however it is much more likely that he came from a family of the name based on the lower Seine valley. William was likely the nephew of Samson de Malveisin, Archbishop of Rheims from 1140 to 1161. In this context, William's career can come as no surprise.\nWilliam appears in Scottish records for the first time in the 1180s, appearing as a royal clerk. In 1193, the royal patronage he had earned brought him his first known ecclesiastical post, as Archdeacon of Lothian. He was made the king's Chancellor probably on 8 September 1199, and was elected to the Bishopric of Glasgow in October the same year. He was consecrated at Lyon by Renaud de Forez, Archbishop of Lyon, in September 1200. However, two years later in the same month, he was translated to the higher ranking Bishopric of St. Andrews. William got into a little trouble for exercising his episcopal powers before his episcopate had been confirmed by the Pope, then Innocent III; a charge was brought against him by one of his canons, a man named Eustace. The charge was heard by the Papal legate, John of Salerno, who held a council at Perth in December 1201, before leaving for business in Ireland. Legate John once again visited Scotland on his way back from Ireland, staying for more than fifty days at Melrose. However, nothing came of the charge.Walter Bower relates that William received the permission of King William to visit his relatives in France. This was perhaps between May 1212 and Spring 1213, when Bishop William disappears from the records. When not visiting home, Bishop William, like most other Bishops of St. Andrews, was keen to expand the power of the bishopric. In one instance, when Gille \u00cdsu, the hereditary priest of Wedale (Peebleshire) died, he took the opportunity to absorb the church into his diocese. Bishop William enjoyed good relations with the native Scottish clerical order of his diocese, the people \"qui Keledei vulgariter appellantur\" (commonly called C\u00e9li D\u00e9, Gaelic for \"Vassals of God\"). At some point between 1206 and 1216, and again in 1220, he managed to obtain absolution from the sentence of excommunication bestowed on the C\u00e9li D\u00e9 by the Pope; it may be that Bishop William's patronage ensured the opening priesthoods of its church, the Church of St Mary on the Rock at St. Andrews, to non-native clergy, to men such as Henry de Weles, and encouraged the order to consolidate its position vis-\u00e0-vis the papacy.According to the arguments of D.D.R. Owen, William was not only a bishop, but an author of Arthurian romance. The author of the romance known to us as the Roman de Fergus identifies himself as Guillaume le Clerc, or William the Clerk. In the words of Owen, \"it is most reasonable to keep our eyes open for any French clerk by the name of William (Guillaume)\" in the period concerned, and Owen uses textual and contextual evidence to show that William de Malveisin is one of the most likely known candidates.Bishop William died at a place called \"Inchemordauch\" (Inis Muiredaich), one of the Bishopric's manors, in 1238, probably on 9 July. The next consecrated Bishop of St. Andrews was David de Bernham.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He joined the French Communist Party at the age of 17 in 1939 when the Communist Party was banned for supporting the German-Soviet pact. In July 1940, he created a student club, the Centre la\u00efque des auberges de la jeunesse (Claj), which served as a legal screen for the clandestine Union of Communist Students.When David Rousset (1912-1997) spoke out about Stalin's vast system of prison camps, Daix attacked him as a liar, denying that the GULAG system existed in the Soviet Union, in a 16 page article in Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises, entitled \"Pourquoi M. David Rousset a-t-il invent\u00e9 les camps sovi\u00e9tiques?\". Rousset brought libel charges against Daix and there was a public trial in France, which Rousset, who had told the truth about the camps, won in 1950.  As a French communist, Daix continued his uncritical support for the Soviet Union for many years, though late in life he admitted he had been wrong.From 1980 to 1985, he was a journalist for Le Quotidien de Paris.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

Puri\u0107's cabinet was composed of nonpolitical appointees. Puri\u0107, alike the previous prime ministers of the government-in-exile supported the Chetniks (the Serbian nationalist movement in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia), and their leader, Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 remained Minister of Defence in Puri\u0107's cabinet. Chetnik collaboration with Italians and the Germans, as well as fighting against the Partisan resistance movement caused the British to pressure the Yugoslav government to remove Mihailovi\u0107 from office. After Puri\u0107 assumed office this pressure became more intense as creating a strong resistance in Yugoslavia became imperative for reducing pressure on Allied forces fighting in Italy.

The government moved to Cairo, a move which was suggested by the British during Trifunovi\u0107's tenure. It was decided that Bogoljub Jevti\u0107 should become Yugoslav ambassador to London and King Peter was given permission to marry Princess Alexandra which was opposed by the previous Prime Ministers.On 7 December 1943, Anthony Eden talked for the first time with Puri\u0107 since the Tehran conference, where it was decided that Allies should support Yugoslav Partisans.

He also expressed concern that Allied military support to Partisans would cause conservative elements of the population to collaborate with the Germans. This confirmed suspicions of the Chetnik collaboration with the Germans, despite Puri\u0107 likely not knowing about non-aggression pacts concluded between the Chetniks and Germans few weeks prior.In March 1944, the Allies decided to withdraw aid and recognition from the Chetniks after a period of worsening relations between the British and the Chetniks.

In November that year, to assuage Uebelhoer's qualms about ghetto arson started by Gypsies, Heinrich Himmler advised Uebelhoer to shoot ten Gypsies for every fire that broke out within the ghetto.  Those Gypsies who did not perish in the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto were killed by gas vans in January 1942 in Che\u0142mno.Uebelhoer was dismissed from his post as governor of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in December 1942 after being accused of embezzlement by Arthur Greiser. The charges were ultimately unproven, but the suspicion damaged his reputation and halted his advancement in the SS. He would return in January 1944 in the lesser role of governor of the Merseburg district.Uebelhoer disappeared in the latter days of the Second World War and remained unaccounted for. He was declared legally dead in 1950.", "hasanswer": false}]}

LeDoux served as mayor of the Kodiak Island Borough March 2001 through October 2004. LeDoux was then elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 2004. Taking office in January 2005, she served two terms in the Alaska State Legislature, through January 2009 and was a recipient of the Toll Fellowship in 2006. While in the legislature LeDoux served as co-chair of both the Fisheries and the Community and Regional Affairs Committees. She was also a member of the Labor and Commerce, and Resources committees.In October 2007, LeDoux announced her candidacy for the United States House of Representatives in Alaska's At-large congressional district in 2008, challenging 18-term congressman Don Young and Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell. LeDoux was dubbed a spoiler and placed a distant third in the primary, garnering less than 10 percent of the vote. The only part of the state she carried was her former legislative district, by a plurality. Ledoux said in July 2009 that she would not run again in 2010 if Young sought re-election.After her second term in the house ended in January 2009, LeDoux moved to east Anchorage from Kodiak Island in 2009, and ran for State House in her new district in the 2010 elections. She lost to Pete Petersen in the general election by 5 percent (47 percent to 52 percent). In 2012, LeDoux's presumptive Democratic opponent withdrew after winning an uncontested primary, and was replaced by Kay Rollison. LeDoux beat Rollison in the general election. She defeated retired colonel Laurie Hummel to represent District 15 (East Anchorage) in 2014 (52 percent to 47 percent). LeDoux is her own single largest campaign contributor, by a factor of more than 10 times.After being elected in 2016 to her 5th non-consecutive term in the state house, LeDoux joined a majority coalition of Democrats, Independents and two other Republicans, with an avowed goal of ameliorating the state's budget deficit, the latter a product of declining oil revenues, budgeting, and prior taxation restructuring. LeDoux was chosen to chair the house Rules Committee. Alaska state Republican Party chair, Tuckerman Babcock, informed LeDoux by letter that the party will recruit and support a primary opponent against her in 2018. After joining the majority coalition in 2016, LeDoux expressed confidence that she would be representing the needs of her constituents saying \"We're hired to do a job, and the purpose of our job is not to keep our job.

He was re-elected to the Parliament in 1992 and 1996 on the list of the ruling Liberal Democracy of Slovenia.

Thaler's term in office was marked by tensions with neighbouring Italy, which had already begun in the previous years. The disagreements between the two countries were mostly centered around the issue of property restitution to Italian refugees from Yugoslavia from the late 1940s. Thaler was involved in several negotiations with the Italian Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli, in which he unblocked the Italian veto to Slovenia's access to the European Union. The Italian counterpart demanded that Slovenia changed its constitutional provisions which prevented foreign citizens to acquire real estates in Slovenia. In 1996, Slovenia agreed to the so-called \"Spanish compromise\", in which Slovenia promised to liberalize its property market regulations, allowing Italian and other EU citizens to purchase real estate in Slovenia. This resulted in the unblock of the Italian veto to Slovenia's access to the European Union. The deal made it possible for Slovenia to sign the Association Agreement with the EU on 10 June 1996 in Luxembourg and formally apply for membership in the EU the same day.\nIn May 1996, Thaler was impeached by the Parliament. In the final impeachment vote, a part of the ruling coalition (MPs from the Slovene Christian Democrats) joined the two major opposition forces (the Slovenian People's Party and the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia).In December 1996, Thaler was re-elected to Parliament on the list of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia. In 1997 he became again Minister of Foreign Affairs in Janez Drnov\u0161ek's third cabinet. During his mandate, the Parliament ratified the Association Agreement with the EU, after having changed the Constitution a day earlier in accordance with the Spanish compromise. The European Commission gave a positive opinion on the Slovenian application for membership shortly afterwards. After that achievement Thaler left politics for business. Between 2004 and 2006, he served as chairman of Si.mobil, Slovenia's second largest mobile operator.\nIn 2009, he headed the list of the Social Democrats for the European Parliament, not being a member of the party and was elected on 7 June 2009. As a member of the European Parliament, Thaler was EP Rapporteur for Macedonia, vice-chairman of the EP Delegation for the South Caucasus, and a member of EP Foreign Affairs Committee.\nIn March 2011, The Sunday Times implicated Thaler among other members of the European Parliament in a cash-for-laws scandal. Rupert Murdoch's Sunday Times also provided edited video of Thaler discussing adding amendments to EU laws with undercover journalists.On 21 March he resigned as a member of the European Parliament.

In the final impeachment vote, a part of the ruling coalition (MPs from the Slovene Christian Democrats) joined the two major opposition forces (the Slovenian People's Party and the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia).In December 1996, Thaler was re-elected to Parliament on the list of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia. In 1997 he became again Minister of Foreign Affairs in Janez Drnov\u0161ek's third cabinet. During his mandate, the Parliament ratified the Association Agreement with the EU, after having changed the Constitution a day earlier in accordance with the Spanish compromise. The European Commission gave a positive opinion on the Slovenian application for membership shortly afterwards. After that achievement Thaler left politics for business. Between 2004 and 2006, he served as chairman of Si.mobil, Slovenia's second largest mobile operator.\nIn 2009, he headed the list of the Social Democrats for the European Parliament, not being a member of the party and was elected on 7 June 2009. As a member of the European Parliament, Thaler was EP Rapporteur for Macedonia, vice-chairman of the EP Delegation for the South Caucasus, and a member of EP Foreign Affairs Committee.\nIn March 2011, The Sunday Times implicated Thaler among other members of the European Parliament in a cash-for-laws scandal. Rupert Murdoch's Sunday Times also provided edited video of Thaler discussing adding amendments to EU laws with undercover journalists.On 21 March he resigned as a member of the European Parliament. European Anti-fraud Office \u2013 OLAF investigated the case. In January 2012 OLAF concluded the investigation with the decision that there was \"no infringement\" on Thaler's side.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

Dagelet's astronomical sightings gave precision to the maps posthumously published in the official Atlas du Voyage de la Perouse (Paris: L'Imprimerie de la Republique, An V, 1797).\nYoung Dagelet arrived in Paris in 1767, welcomed by his uncles the renowned clockmakers Jean-Andr\u00e9 and Jean-Baptiste Lepaute, who held the brevet horlogers du Roi. Through his aunt, Nicole-Reine Lepaute, wife of Jean-Andr\u00e9, he discovered his aptitude for astronomy. From his arrival until 1772 he studied in the observatory of the Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin, where he was guided by Joseph J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lefran\u00e7ois de Lalande.\nIn 1773 he departed for the South Seas with the expedition of Yves Joseph de Kerguelen de Tr\u00e9marec; on his return he was made professor of mathematics at the \u00c9cole Militaire, Paris.\nDagelet is known particularly for having calculated the distance between the center of Mercury and the Sun and for his map of the solar eclipse of 1778. Dagelet discovered WY Sagittae, a nova in Sagitta (27-29 July 1783) and was a scientific observer of the balloon ascent of Jacques Alexandre C\u00e9sar Charles from the Champ de Mars, Paris, 27 August 1783.\nHe presented his observations of the planets and stars to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences and was received as adjoint and then named astronomer to the Academy in 1785, the year he embarked at Brest on the fatal expedition.\nAfter extensively mapping and recording the coastlines of North America, Japan, Korea and Siberia, Lap\u00e9rouse was directed by the French government to go to Botany Bay to observe the founding of the British Colony by the First Fleet. On 26 January 1788 Lap\u00e9rouse arrived at Botany Bay, just as the British were leaving for Port Jackson. The French ships stayed at Botany Bay for six weeks and built a stockade, observatory and a garden for fresh produce on the La Perouse peninsula. At Botany Bay Dagelet undertook calculations on map position of Botany Bay, carried out astronomical observations and met with William Dawes at Port Jackson. Dawes volunteered for service with the First Fleet and sailed on the Sirius. From February 1788, he was employed on shore to build an observatory at Dawes Point. Following this meeting Dagelet sent a letter to Dawes (1762-1836) with advice to Dawes on setting up his observatory, recent work on the fluctuations of the Earth's magnetic field and calculations on maps positions of Botany Bay.The island of Dagelet, named in his honour, is now known by its Korean name, Ulleungdo.

The track brought him recognition after it was included on the label's showcase album Fast Money, a 1986 compilation featuring Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's debut recording and a track by hip hop pioneer Disco Dave.In 1987, Positive K signed to Nat Robinson's First Priority Music under the management of Lumumba Carson (the son of activist Sonny Carson) who would later become better known as X-Clan founding member Professor X The Overseer. With the guidance and production skills of Grand Puba of Brand Nubian and Daddy-O of Stetsasonic, Positive K released a number of songs that appeared on various underground compilations. His 1989 duet with MC Lyte \"I'm Not Havin' It\" was Positive K's first song to land on a Billboard music chart and it helped further establish his reputation in hip hop. Positive K soon left First Priority Music, feeling there was favoritism happening with the owner's relatives on the label.After leaving First Priority Music, Positive K began working closely with Big Daddy Kane, whom he'd met through a mutual friend. He would bring Positive K on stage to freestyle with Jay-Z and Sauce Money. Guest spots on Brand Nubian\u2019s One for All and Grand Puba's Reel to Reel along with his self-released, Big Daddy Kane-produced single \"Nightshift\" generated enough interest to land him a major record label deal.\nThe Skills Dat Pay Da Bills, Positive K's 1992 full-length debut on Island Records, balanced themes of Nation of Gods and Earths with gangsta-isms and more pop-based moments. The album's most successful single was \"I Got a Man,\" a track loosely based on his earlier duet with MC Lyte \"I'm Not Havin' It.\" This time, however, he pitch-shifted his own vocals to perform the lines of the track's female rapper himself. \"I Got A Man\" reached #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1993. Meanwhile, he kept his Creative Control label in operation, signing and cultivating new talent.\nLater that year, Positive K was featured in a remix of the song \"Come To Butt-head\" with Beavis and Butt-head on the soundtrack album for the film The Beavis and Butt-head Experience. The song is hidden at the end of the album on the same track as \"I Got You Babe,\" performed by Beavis and Butt-head with Cher. The same year, Positive K briefly appeared in the Robert De Niro film A Bronx Tale as an angry protester and was featured on WYBE's Old School Show, where he was awarded the #3 slot on the list of early hip hop pioneers.\nAfter touring extensively to promote The Skills Dat Pay Da Bills, Positive K focused his efforts on other interests. Island Records had wanted him to record a full album with Grand Puba, but only one song, \"Back Together Again,\" was recorded and the track never saw release. Instead, he started a promotion company, handling record promotions for Def Jam Recordings and London Records, and booked acts in his Harlem studio. During this time, he also worked with Outkast, Rampage and Puff Daddy. Eventually he became fed up with the music business and took a short break from it.In late 1996, Positive K re-emerged and told Billboard Magazine that his sophomore album, due out in February 1997, would be named Straight To The Moon. He explained the album, like his debut, would be released on both his personal record label Creative Control as well as Island Records, and would feature guest appearances by Al Green and Harry Connick Jr. Its Teddy Riley-produced lead single \"Black Cinderella\" saw an independent label 1996 release on PosK Records but the full album never materialized.\nPositive K has continued to release music over the last 20+ years without duplicating his earlier success of \"I Got a Man,\" earning him the status of one hit wonder. In 2007, he appeared on Nas' track \"Where Are They Now ('90s Remix).\" In 2008, a compilation album Back to the Old School was released under the EchoVista label.

Gibson's first musical endeavor was a short-lived rap group with his family named Disco Cousins, and he rapped under the name Baby Breeze.Later, while a member of the Five-Percent Nation, Gibson joined the rap group Almighty God Committee from Queens, rapping under the name Positive Knowledge Allah. However, after their DJ played the wrong side of a record at a televised rap contest and the rest of the group walked offstage, Gibson continued on as a solo act under the shortened name Positive K.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_37365", "text": "Glenn Toby, a fellow Queens rapper known as Mr Sweety G, produced Positive K's first solo record \"Getting Paid\" for the short-lived independent label Star Maker Records. The track brought him recognition after it was included on the label's showcase album Fast Money, a 1986 compilation featuring Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's debut recording and a track by hip hop pioneer Disco Dave.In 1987, Positive K signed to Nat Robinson's First Priority Music under the management of Lumumba Carson (the son of activist Sonny Carson) who would later become better known as X-Clan founding member Professor X The Overseer. With the guidance and production skills of Grand Puba of Brand Nubian and Daddy-O of Stetsasonic, Positive K released a number of songs that appeared on various underground compilations. His 1989 duet with MC Lyte \"I'm Not Havin' It\" was Positive K's first song to land on a Billboard music chart and it helped further establish his reputation in hip hop. Positive K soon left First Priority Music, feeling there was favoritism happening with the owner's relatives on the label.After leaving First Priority Music, Positive K began working closely with Big Daddy Kane, whom he'd met through a mutual friend. He would bring Positive K on stage to freestyle with Jay-Z and Sauce Money. Guest spots on Brand Nubian\u2019s One for All and Grand Puba's Reel to Reel along with his self-released, Big Daddy Kane-produced single \"Nightshift\" generated enough interest to land him a major record label deal.\nThe Skills Dat Pay Da Bills, Positive K's 1992 full-length debut on Island Records, balanced themes of Nation of Gods and Earths with gangsta-isms and more pop-based moments. The album's most successful single was \"I Got a Man,\" a track loosely based on his earlier duet with MC Lyte \"I'm Not Havin' It.\" This time, however, he pitch-shifted his own vocals to perform the lines of the track's female rapper himself. \"I Got A Man\" reached #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1993. Meanwhile, he kept his Creative Control label in operation, signing and cultivating new talent.\nLater that year, Positive K was featured in a remix of the song \"Come To Butt-head\" with Beavis and Butt-head on the soundtrack album for the film The Beavis and Butt-head Experience. The song is hidden at the end of the album on the same track as \"I Got You Babe,\" performed by Beavis and Butt-head with Cher. The same year, Positive K briefly appeared in the Robert De Niro film A Bronx Tale as an angry protester and was featured on WYBE's Old School Show, where he was awarded the #3 slot on the list of early hip hop pioneers.\nAfter touring extensively to promote The Skills Dat Pay Da Bills, Positive K focused his efforts on other interests. Island Records had wanted him to record a full album with Grand Puba, but only one song, \"Back Together Again,\" was recorded and the track never saw release. Instead, he started a promotion company, handling record promotions for Def Jam Recordings and London Records, and booked acts in his Harlem studio. During this time, he also worked with Outkast, Rampage and Puff Daddy. Eventually he became fed up with the music business and took a short break from it.In late 1996, Positive K re-emerged and told Billboard Magazine that his sophomore album, due out in February 1997, would be named Straight To The Moon. He explained the album, like his debut, would be released on both his personal record label Creative Control as well as Island Records, and would feature guest appearances by Al Green and Harry Connick Jr. Its Teddy Riley-produced lead single \"Black Cinderella\" saw an independent label 1996 release on PosK Records but the full album never materialized.\nPositive K has continued to release music over the last 20+ years without duplicating his earlier success of \"I Got a Man,\" earning him the status of one hit wonder. In 2007, he appeared on Nas' track \"Where Are They Now ('90s Remix).\" In 2008, a compilation album Back to the Old School was released under the EchoVista label. In 2015, Positive K teamed with Greg Nice on his song \"Make It Happen\" which led to a pairing that would result in a full-length album in 2017, preceded by its lead single was \"Bring It.\" The pair refer to themselves individually as PK Dolla and N.I. and collectively as Gr8te Mindz, but the album is sold online under the artist name \"Positive K and Greg Nice.\"\nPositive K told Unkut in 2013 that his next solo effort would be titled Pos K In The Extreme, but it has yet to surface.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Internationally, his fame arises chiefly from his extensive body of choral music, which exceeds 500 individual choral songs, most of it a cappella. The great majority of these pieces are based on traditional ancient Estonian folksongs (regilaulud), either textually, melodically, or merely stylistically.\nHis composition most often performed outside Estonia, Curse Upon Iron (Raua needmine) (1972), invokes ancient Shamanistic traditions to construct an allegory about the evils of war. Some of his works were banned by the Soviet government, but because folk music was fundamental to his style most of his compositions were accepted by the censors.\nMore recently, Tormis' works have been performed and recorded by T\u00f5nu Kaljuste with the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, and others. In the 1990s, Tormis began to receive commissions from some a cappella groups as the King's Singers and the Hilliard Ensemble.\nTormis famously said of his settings of traditional melodies and verse: \"It is not I who makes use of folk music, it is folk music that makes use of me.\" His work demonstrates his conviction that traditional Estonian and other Balto-Finnic music represents a treasure which must be guarded and nourished, and that culture may be kept alive through the medium of song.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "106_37484", "text": "Born in Kuusalu in 1930, Tormis had a profound experience with choral music starting at an early age.

Felton, president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, to investigate secessionist activity and threats of damage to the railroad in Maryland. Pinkerton went to work placing agents at various points in Maryland to investigate this potential activity. As the investigation proceeded, Pinkerton became aware that the activity in Maryland did not just end with the railroad; it also included the president-elect, Abraham Lincoln. Pinkerton received permission to continue his investigation and focus on the possible assassination plot. Warne was one of five agents sent to Baltimore, Maryland, on February 3, 1861, to investigate the hotbed of secessionist activity.During the investigation, evidence unveiled a plot to assassinate Lincoln on his way to take office. Under the aliases Mrs. Cherry and Mrs. M. Barley (M.B.), Warne tracked suspicious movement among the Baltimore secessionists. It was in part through her undercover work in the guise of a wealthy Southern lady visiting Baltimore \"with a thick southern accent\", allowing her to infiltrate secessionist social gatherings in the Baltimore area. This included the classy Barnum Hotel, also known as Barnum's City Hotel, allowing her to verify a plot to assassinate Lincoln and develop details of how the assassination was going to occur. Pinkerton had agents across Maryland, but it was Warne specifically who supplied many of the key details that led Pinkerton to believe that the plot was imminent. Warne had befriended secessionists in Maryland and collected many details about the plot to assassinate Lincoln.The president-elect, Abraham Lincoln, was traveling from his home in Springfield, Illinois, to the Capital via a train tour that was to stop at notable cities along the way. His published program showed that Lincoln's last leg of the journey was from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Washington, D.C. Due to the configuration of the rail system, all southbound trains required a transfer to be made in Baltimore, Maryland. The tracks from points north ended at Calvert Street and the tracks heading south started at Camden Street (now the Camden Yards station). The distance between these two stations was about a mile by carriage ride. The secessionist plot to kill Lincoln was said to be that when Lincoln was passing through part of Calvert St. Station, a row or fight would occur, resulting in police officers rushing out, leaving Lincoln \"entirely unprotected and at the mercy of a mob of Secessionists\" that would then surround him. It was further alleged that a small steamship had been charted, sitting in a nearby river, on which the murderers would flee, and travel immediately to the state of Virginia.After seeing the pieces of the plot coming together, Pinkerton directed Kate Warne to take the 5:10 evening train to New York City on the morning of February 18. Once there, she was to set up a meeting with Norman B. Judd and give him a letter from Pinkerton outlining the known details of the assassination attempt. After receiving the details of the Baltimore Plot from Warne, Judd set up a meeting between himself, Pinkerton, and Lincoln on February 21. At this meeting, Lincoln was doubtful of the existence of an assassination plot or that if such a plot existed that it should be taken seriously.\nHowever, a second independent source confirmed the plot by way of Frederick W. Seward, son of William H. Seward (the secretary of state\u2013designate). From this point, Lincoln agreed that the assassination plot was plausible enough to take action. Lincoln decided to avoid hazard where it was not necessary; however, he refused to cancel any of his scheduled plans in Harrisburg. His agenda included: giving three speeches, raising of the American flag at Independence Hall, and attending a high-profile dinner.Train arrangements were made accordingly that allowed Lincoln to fulfill his scheduled duties in Harrisburg. It was not until 5:45 at night that there was any deviation from his schedule. John George Nicolay, Lincoln's private secretary, interrupted the dinner party to excuse the president-elect. Lincoln then changed into a traveling suit and a soft felt cap. He carried a shawl upon one arm to play the role of an invalid.

Allegedly the producers had all but given up on the show, because they did not feel that they had found a suitable actress for the part, until they discovered Alexander.  She was actually younger than actress Barbara Llewellyn, who played her stepdaughter Meg in the series, but producers and audiences felt that they were both convincing in their roles.\nThe ten-part series delivered huge ratings when it was broadcast in 1973, and was also the first ABC series to enjoy international acclaim. It went on to win three Australian Film Institute Awards and four Penguins, including best drama series and the 1974 George Wallace Memorial Logie for Best New Talent for Alexander as the sweet-tempered Esther.  The series is now available on DVD.\nAlexander had a recurring guest role in the high rating Australian medical drama All Saints as the viper-like Dr. Alison Newell, ex-wife of Dr. Frank Campion, played by John Howard.  She was not initially written as his ex-wife, as her character appeared before Howard joined the cast.  Apparently, it was the sharp onscreen dynamic between Alexander and Howard in their early scenes together that made the writers decide to write this history into Alexander's character.\nOther television credits include:  Home and Away (she played Christine Jones, the overprotective conservative mother of Melody Jones), Silent Number, Special Squad, Chopper Squad, Farscape, Murder Call, Seven Deadly Sins (Pride), Salem's Lot and Time Trax, a science fiction series in which she starred as a computer hologram alongside Dale Midkiff.\nHer film work includes: the lead role in The Killing of Angel Street (which won an award at the Berlin Film Festival) opposite John Hargreaves, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, Summerfield with Nick Tate and John Waters, Sebastian and the Sparrow and The Journalist with Sam Neill.  2010 saw her appear in a thriller called The Clinic and in 2011 she made an appearance in Fred Schepisi's The Eye of the Storm.\nHer theatre credits are also numerous and include:  Hermione in The Winter's Tale, Portia in The Merchant of Venice for which she received glowing reviews, Martha in the Sydney Theatre Company's production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? for which she again received extremely positive reviews, Kate in another STC production of Harold Pinter's Old Times and many more.

However, it was straight from graduating at National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) that she got her big break with the part of Esther Wolcott in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) series Seven Little Australians.  Allegedly the producers had all but given up on the show, because they did not feel that they had found a suitable actress for the part, until they discovered Alexander.  She was actually younger than actress Barbara Llewellyn, who played her stepdaughter Meg in the series, but producers and audiences felt that they were both convincing in their roles.\nThe ten-part series delivered huge ratings when it was broadcast in 1973, and was also the first ABC series to enjoy international acclaim. It went on to win three Australian Film Institute Awards and four Penguins, including best drama series and the 1974 George Wallace Memorial Logie for Best New Talent for Alexander as the sweet-tempered Esther.  The series is now available on DVD.\nAlexander had a recurring guest role in the high rating Australian medical drama All Saints as the viper-like Dr. Alison Newell, ex-wife of Dr. Frank Campion, played by John Howard.  She was not initially written as his ex-wife, as her character appeared before Howard joined the cast.  Apparently, it was the sharp onscreen dynamic between Alexander and Howard in their early scenes together that made the writers decide to write this history into Alexander's character.\nOther television credits include:  Home and Away (she played Christine Jones, the overprotective conservative mother of Melody Jones), Silent Number, Special Squad, Chopper Squad, Farscape, Murder Call, Seven Deadly Sins (Pride), Salem's Lot and Time Trax, a science fiction series in which she starred as a computer hologram alongside Dale Midkiff.\nHer film work includes: the lead role in The Killing of Angel Street (which won an award at the Berlin Film Festival) opposite John Hargreaves, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, Summerfield with Nick Tate and John Waters, Sebastian and the Sparrow and The Journalist with Sam Neill.  2010 saw her appear in a thriller called The Clinic and in 2011 she made an appearance in Fred Schepisi's The Eye of the Storm.\nHer theatre credits are also numerous and include:  Hermione in The Winter's Tale, Portia in The Merchant of Venice for which she received glowing reviews, Martha in the Sydney Theatre Company's production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? for which she again received extremely positive reviews, Kate in another STC production of Harold Pinter's Old Times and many more.  She also played anthropologist Margaret Mead in David Williamson's play Heretic.  The play, based on Mead's life and work, was the subject of much debate and controversy due to the very public row between the writer, Williamson, and the director Wayne Harrison over the play's production.Alexander has also directed a number of plays and written several screenplays, including a short film titled Memento (which was sold to Village Roadshow) which she also directed, about the emotional problems caused by the return of a father to his family, a young boy and his mother.

Amongst his other honours include the Kalaimamani Award from the Government of Tamil Nadu in 2004 and an honorary doctorate by the Popular University of Milan in May 2011. Vikram is the first Indian actor to receive the Doctorate in the history of the European Universities in acting. Based on the earnings of Indian celebrities, Vikram was included in the Forbes India Celebrity 100 list for 2016 and 2018.Vikram debuted with the romance En Kadhal Kanmani (1990) followed by his major breakthrough with his portrayal of a rogue-turned-lover in Bala's tragedy film Sethu (1999) and next appeared in hit films like Dhill (2001), Gemini (2002), Dhool (2003), Saamy (2003), Anniyan (2005), Raavanan (2010), Deiva Thirumagal (2011) and Iru Mugan (2017).

In 2016, he produced and directed the video to the flood relief anthem, Spirit of Chennai, as a tribute to the city's volunteers following the 2015 South Indian floods.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "106_37747", "text": "Vikram was born as Kennedy John Victor on 17 April 1966 to a Christian father and a Hindu mother. His father, John Victor (alias Vinod Raj) was a native of Paramakudi and ran away from home to start a career in films, but worked only in minor roles. Vikram's mother, Rajeshwari, was a government officer who reached the rank of sub-collector. Rajeshwari was born in a Hindu family with film connections. Her brother, Thiagarajan, is an established director-actor in the Tamil film industry; he is the father of actor Prashanth, making him Vikram's first cousin (although the two have never openly acknowledged this relationship). Vikram has two siblings, both younger to him. His brother, Arvind, appeared in the low-budget Tamil film, Eppo Kalyanam (2022). His sister, Anitha, is a teacher.\nVikram's father, Vinod Raj, was a small time actor who did not fare successfully in films and only managed to act in supporting roles in Tamil films and television serials. This inspired Vikram to take theatre lessons and become professionally trained in classical and cinema dance forms to ensure that he became a leading actor. Vikram decided to use a screen name because he disliked his original name, Kennedy, and he also felt that such a foreign name was not a fit name for an actor in Tamil films. He took the name Vikram (a Hindu name) which means \"man who does great deeds.\" In one interview, he said that he was also inspired to take the name because it was a mixture of several names dear to him: \"Vi\" from his father's name (Vinod), \"K\" from Kennedy, \"Ra\" from his mother's name (Rajeshwari) and \"ram\" from his sun sign, Aries.Vikram was educated at Montfort School, Yercaud (a boarding school in a hill station near Salem) and graduated in 1983. He has mentioned that he used his opportunities at school well by taking part in karate, horseback riding and swimming and noted that such early exposure to activities gave him confidence as a youngster. Vikram lurked in the fringes of the school's theatre club for a long period and often took part in backstage work before being handed the lead role in a school adaptation of Moli\u00e8re's The Doctor in Spite of Himself after the original lead had contracted chicken pox. Despite expressing his interest to join films after school, his father forced him to go through education and Vikram subsequently graduated from Loyola College, Chennai with a degree in English Literature and worked halfway towards an MBA programme. Through the prolific dramatics club, Vikram appeared in stage productions including college adaptations of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial and Peter Shaffer's Black Comedy, receiving best actor awards for his performances.

His father, John Victor (alias Vinod Raj) was a native of Paramakudi and ran away from home to start a career in films, but worked only in minor roles. Vikram's mother, Rajeshwari, was a government officer who reached the rank of sub-collector. Rajeshwari was born in a Hindu family with film connections. Her brother, Thiagarajan, is an established director-actor in the Tamil film industry; he is the father of actor Prashanth, making him Vikram's first cousin (although the two have never openly acknowledged this relationship). Vikram has two siblings, both younger to him. His brother, Arvind, appeared in the low-budget Tamil film, Eppo Kalyanam (2022). His sister, Anitha, is a teacher.\nVikram's father, Vinod Raj, was a small time actor who did not fare successfully in films and only managed to act in supporting roles in Tamil films and television serials. This inspired Vikram to take theatre lessons and become professionally trained in classical and cinema dance forms to ensure that he became a leading actor. Vikram decided to use a screen name because he disliked his original name, Kennedy, and he also felt that such a foreign name was not a fit name for an actor in Tamil films. He took the name Vikram (a Hindu name) which means \"man who does great deeds.\" In one interview, he said that he was also inspired to take the name because it was a mixture of several names dear to him: \"Vi\" from his father's name (Vinod), \"K\" from Kennedy, \"Ra\" from his mother's name (Rajeshwari) and \"ram\" from his sun sign, Aries.Vikram was educated at Montfort School, Yercaud (a boarding school in a hill station near Salem) and graduated in 1983. He has mentioned that he used his opportunities at school well by taking part in karate, horseback riding and swimming and noted that such early exposure to activities gave him confidence as a youngster. Vikram lurked in the fringes of the school's theatre club for a long period and often took part in backstage work before being handed the lead role in a school adaptation of Moli\u00e8re's The Doctor in Spite of Himself after the original lead had contracted chicken pox. Despite expressing his interest to join films after school, his father forced him to go through education and Vikram subsequently graduated from Loyola College, Chennai with a degree in English Literature and worked halfway towards an MBA programme. Through the prolific dramatics club, Vikram appeared in stage productions including college adaptations of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial and Peter Shaffer's Black Comedy, receiving best actor awards for his performances.

Stewart was succeeded by Trevor Noah, whose tenure began on September 28, 2015. Under the different hosts, the show has been formally known as The Daily Show with Craig Kilborn from 1996 to 1998, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from 1999 until 2015, and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah from 2015 to 2022.

She now lives in Hailey, Idaho, with her husband Bob, a hunter/jumper and trainer. Debbie trains and teaches riders on Peggy and E. Parry Thomas's River Grove Farm in Sun Valley, Idaho.\nMcDonald's first mount was an $800 pony. She agreed that she would pay for board if her parents bought it for her. Shortly thereafter Debbie managed to find a gaited horse trainer near her hometown who allowed her to groom horses and clean stalls in exchange for board.  At age 14,  when Debbie went to turn her pony out, she discovered a strange man in his stall, beating him. She went running for help and ran into a young trainer and her future husband, Bob McDonald, who ran a hunter/jumper farm and hired her as a stable hand.  It was at this facility that she began her career.McDonald began her career in show jumping. However, she switched to dressage after a serious fall in which her horse somersaulted over her breaking ribs, rupturing her spleen, and fracturing a vertebra in her neck,   She first met Parry and Peggy Thomas when she got a catch ride at a dressage show in Las Vegas on one of their horses whose rider was not available.The Thomases also became the owners of Brentina, a chestnut Hanoverian mare that became McDonald's primary mount. McDonald and her husband obtained the mare at an auction in Germany in 1994.  Brentina, foaled in 1991, had a suitable temperament to respect McDonald, who is only five feet tall, and the team established a partnership that took them to the Olympics. McDonald and Brentina began by winning the Individual and Team Gold medals at the 1999 Pan American Games.  In recognition of this accomplishment, McDonald was named the 1999 Equestrian of the Year by the United States Equestrian Federation and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) Female Equestrian Athlete of the Year.   In 2003, McDonald become the first American rider to win the Dressage World Cup, and the pair placed third at the 2005 World Cup. As members of the United States Equestrian Team they won a team silver and team bronze at the 2002 and 2006 World Equestrian Games.  At the 2004 Athens Olympics, the pair won the team bronze and were individually fourth overall, and McDonald was dubbed  \"First Lady of American Dressage.\"Brentina was named the 2005 Farnam/Platform USEF Horse of the Year. After the 2008 Olympics, where the mare had an uncharacteristically poor performance, she was retired to the Thomas' farm. While McDonald went on to compete with other horses, Brentina developed an impaction in early 2009 and underwent colic surgery to remove a fecalith from her small colon.  She has since recovered and attended a retirement ceremony at the 2009 FEI World Cup Dressage Finals in Las Vegas.On January 22, 2010 McDonald was named the U.S. Equestrian Federation's Developing Dressage Coach, a role designed to identify and cultivate future US Dressage stars.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He created the Collegium Musicum there, developing his interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, later expanding his activities to include the Classical and early Romantic eras. He is now in demand as a fortepianist in concert halls across Europe, where he is known for his refined sensitivity to the rhetorical aspects of music and for his skills in improvisation. (His cadenzas were singled out in reviews of his Beethoven concerto recordings.) Over the years, he has acquired a unique collection of period keyboard instruments, which travel with him for concerts and CD recordings.\nIn 1977, he attracted international attention when he conducted Monteverdi's L'Orfeo in the former Royal Flemish Opera House in Antwerp. This series of 18 performances established a new standard which remains to this day.\nFrom 1980 to 1985, he was the artistic director of the Sweelinck Conservatory of Amsterdam.\nIn 1987 Van Immerseel established the \"period instrument\" ensemble Anima Eterna, which he continues to lead. This ensemble has become well-known and achieved a world-wide reputation particularly for the CD series of Mozart's complete piano concerti (with van Immerseel as soloist and conductor).\nDuring 1999 they toured Europe with performances of Beethoven symphonies.\nIn addition to his concertising, Van Immerseel is professor at the Antwerp Conservatory, where he uses historical instruments from the nearby Vleeshuis Museum to give masterclasses. He has also taught at the Sweelinck Conservatorium in Amsterdam and the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur in Paris, as well as given masterclasses at festivals in La Roque-d'Anth\u00e9ron, Utrecht, Sopron and Ancona.\nVan Immerseel appears on Sony Classical's Vivarte imprint as a solo performer, as a soloist with Tafelmusik and as a participant in chamber music. Among his partners were: Midori Seiler (violin), Claire Chevallier (piano duo), Lisa Shklyaver (clarinet), Thomas Bauer (baritone), Yeree Suh (soprano), and Chouchane Siranossian (violin).\nSince winning first prize at the inaugural Paris International Harpsichord Competition in 1973, Jos Van Immerseel has established an international career as a fortepianist and conductor specializing in music of the Baroque and Classical eras. Accomplished on the organ and piano as well as harpsichord and fortepiano, Van Immerseel has in particular gained a reputation for his performances of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert on Sony Classical. Most recently he has appeared on Vivarte with Anner Bylsma in performances of Beethoven's complete cello sonatas (S2K 60761) and with L'Archibudelli in performances of Schubert's \"Trout\" Quintet and \"Arpeggione\" Sonata (SK 63361). His recent cycle of Beethoven Piano concertos with Tafelmusik and Bruno Weil (Nos. 1 and 2: SK 68250; Nos. 3 and 4: SK 62824; No. 5: SK 63365) elicited praise for his stylistic sensitivity and his musical sensibility. His recording of Mozart's late piano works, Mozart: The Vienna Years (S2K 62879), prompted Classic CD to write that Van Immerseel is \"among the most winning and authoritative champions of the fortepiano\".\nSince 2002 he has been artistic director of the Collection Anima Eterna for the Parisian label Zig-Zag Territories.\nIn 2010, the city of Bremen awarded him the Prize of the Musikfest Bremen for his career.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, and, after the war, was educated at Harvard University, where he excelled academically. He later became a professor of government at the university and earned an international reputation as an expert on nuclear weapons and foreign policy. He frequently acted as a consultant to government agencies, think tanks, and the presidential campaigns of Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Nixon before being appointed national security advisor.\nKissinger pioneered the policy of d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union, orchestrated an opening of relations with China, engaged in \"shuttle diplomacy\" in the Middle East to end the Yom Kippur War, and negotiated the Paris Peace Accords, which ended American involvement in the Vietnam War. For his role in negotiating the end of the Vietnam War, he was awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize under controversial circumstances. A practitioner of a pragmatic approach to politics called Realpolitik, he has been widely considered by scholars to have been an effective secretary of state.Kissinger is also associated with controversial U.S. policies, including its bombing of Cambodia, involvement in the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat, support for Argentina's military junta in its Dirty War, support for Indonesia in its invasion of East Timor, and support for Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War and Bangladesh genocide. He was accused of war crimes for the civilian death toll of the policies he pursued, his role in facilitating U.S. support for dictatorial regimes, and willful ignorance towards human rights abuses committed by the United States and its allies.After leaving government, Kissinger founded Kissinger Associates, an international geopolitical consulting firm.

He had a younger brother, Walter (1924\u20132021), who was a businessman. Kissinger's family was German-Jewish. His great-great-grandfather Meyer L\u00f6b adopted \"Kissinger\" as his surname in 1817, taking it from the Bavarian spa town of Bad Kissingen. In his childhood, Kissinger enjoyed playing soccer. He played for the youth team of SpVgg F\u00fcrth, which was one of the nation's best clubs at the time.In a 2022 BBC interview, Kissinger vividly recalled being nine years old in 1933 and learning of Adolf Hitler's election as Chancellor of Germany, which proved to be a profound turning point for the Kissinger family. During Nazi rule, Kissinger and his friends were regularly harassed and beaten by Hitler Youth gangs. Kissinger sometimes defied the segregation imposed by Nazi racial laws by sneaking into soccer stadiums to watch matches, often resulting in beatings from security guards. As a result of the Nazis' anti-Semitic laws, Kissinger was unable to gain admittance to the Gymnasium and his father was dismissed from his teaching job.On August 20, 1938, when Kissinger was 15 years old, he and his family fled Germany to avoid further Nazi persecution. The family briefly stopped in London before arriving in New York City on September 5. Kissinger later downplayed the influence his experiences of Nazi persecution had had on his policies, writing that the \"Germany of my youth had a great deal of order and very little justice; it was not the sort of place likely to inspire devotion to order in the abstract.\" Nevertheless, many scholars, including Kissinger's biographer Walter Isaacson, have argued that his experiences influenced the formation of his realist approach to foreign policy.Kissinger spent his high-school years in the German-Jewish community in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. Although Kissinger assimilated quickly into American culture, he never lost his pronounced German accent, due to childhood shyness that made him hesitant to speak. After his first year at George Washington High School, he began attending school at night while working in a shaving brush factory during the day.Following high school, Kissinger studied accounting at the City College of New York, excelling academically as a part-time student while continuing to work.

In 1952, while still a graduate student at Harvard, he served as a consultant to the director of the Psychological Strategy Board, and founded a magazine, Confluence. At that time, he sought to work as a spy for the FBI.\nKissinger's doctoral dissertation was titled Peace, Legitimacy, and the Equilibrium (A Study of the Statesmanship of Castlereagh and Metternich). Stephen Graubard, Kissinger's friend, asserted that Kissinger primarily pursued such endeavor to instruct himself on the history of power play between European states in the 19th century. In his doctoral dissertation, Kissinger first introduced the concept of \"legitimacy\", which he defined as: \"Legitimacy as used here should not be confused with justice. It means no more than an international agreement about the nature of workable arrangements and about the permissible aims and methods of foreign policy\". An international order accepted by all of the major powers is \"legitimate\" whereas an international order not accepted by one or more of the great powers is \"revolutionary\" and hence dangerous. Thus, when after the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the leaders of Britain, France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia agreed to co-operate in the Concert of Europe to preserve the peace after Austria, Prussia, and Russia participated in a series of three Partitions of Poland, in Kissinger's viewpoint this international system was \"legitimate\" because it was accepted by the leaders of all five of the Great Powers of Europe.

During 1955 and 1956, he was also study director in nuclear weapons and foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. He released his book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy the following year. The book, which criticized the Eisenhower administration's massive retaliation nuclear doctrine, caused much controversy at the time by proposing the use of tactical nuclear weapons on a regular basis to win wars. That same year, he published A World Restored, a study of balance-of-power politics in post-Napoleonic Europe.\nFrom 1956 to 1958, Kissinger worked for the Rockefeller Brothers Fund as director of its Special Studies Project.

He studied at the Soeurs de la Providence and at the Notre-Dame-du-Saint-Rosaire school in Montreal, the Sacre-C\u0153ur college in Montmagny and the Seminaire de Qu\u00e9bec. His first wife was C\u00e9cile Collin, deceased in 1957, with whom he had 6 daughters and one adopted son. In 1959, he married Simone Ouellet who already had 4 children.\nAt the young age of 16, Andr\u00e9 Rousseau began work in one of his father's companies. His father, Lacasse, has been recognized as a pioneer in the development of electricity in the Montmagny\u2014L'Islet region. From 1935 to 1940, Andr\u00e9 Rousseau worked at Dufresne Engineering and was in charge of overseeing the electrification project during the construction of the Wellington tunnel that passed under the Lachine Canal and the Pierre Le Gardeur Bridge in Montreal. From 1940 to 1950, he was Vice President of Electrical Manufacturing Limited in Montmagny, a company also founded by his father, (which later became Montel).\nIn 1950, after relocating to Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, Andr\u00e9 Rousseau rounded Rousseau Metal inc., and  later Moto-Kometik in the 1970s.

In June 1960 at the National Assembly of Quebec, he was elected to serve as a Member of Parliament for the Quebec Liberal Party in the county of Montmagny-L'Islet. In July, he was named Minister of Industry and Commerce under the government of Jean Lesage. During his mandate as Minister, he accomplished many projects. Among these were the creation of an Economic Research Office and a Statistics Office; the funding for creating the Centre de l'organisation scientifique de l'entreprise (Cose); the creation of the Loi des fonds industriels municipaux; the division of Quebec into regions (see List of regions of Quebec) and the installation of delegates of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce into each of these regions; and finally, the creation of Economic Boards, now known as the Conseil regional de d\u00e9veloppement (CRD's). On an international level, he succeeded in giving weight to economic teams of the first delegations outside of Quebec in New York, London and Paris.\nAlthough Rousseau was personally opposed to the nationalization of private electricity companies, he remained faithful to the government, and sought a second mandate at the 1962 Quebec general election. Although defeated on election night,  by Fernand Lizotte of the Union Nationale (Quebec),  Rousseau remained very active in the political arena.

As the feature film evolved in the mid 1910s, he and his team (comprising screenwriter Charles Maigne, art director Ben Carr\u00e9, and cameramen John van den Broek and Lucien Andriot) coupled exceptional technological skill with unique pictorial and architectural sensibilities in their productions, giving their films a visual distinctiveness that met with critical acclaim.\n\nTourneur admired D.W. Griffith and considered the skill level of American actors at the time ahead of their counterparts in Europe. Of the actresses he worked with, he called Mary Pickford the finest screen actress in the world and believed that stage actress Elsie Ferguson was a brilliant artist. However, Tourneur opposed the evolving star system that Carl Laemmle had begun with his advertising campaign for actress Florence Lawrence.\nAfter directing several innovative films for Adolph Zukor's Artcraft Pictures Corporation (which released through Paramount) in 1917 and 1918, Tourneur launched his own production company with the film Sporting Life. In 1921 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. By 1922 he believed that the future of the film industry lay in Hollywood and the following year he was hired by Samuel Goldwyn to go to the West Coast and make a film version of the Hall Caine novel The Christian. However, Tourneur's career in the United States faltered in the 1920s as his pictorialism sometimes hampered the narrative drive of his later films, and he also separated from his wife Fernande in 1923. He was removed from production on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's version of Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island in 1928, and this marked the end of his American career.\nAfter his trouble with MGM, Tourneur decided to move back to his native France. There, he continued to make films both at home and in Germany, easily making the change to talkies. In 1933 he met his second wife, actress Louise Lagrange (1898\u20131979), while shooting his film, L'Homme myst\u00e9rieux. Tourneur went on to direct another two dozen films, several of which were crime thrillers, until a 1949 automobile accident in which he was seriously injured and lost a leg.

He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood.Le Courrier describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society.Maidana is known for \"his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry \"at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\".\nHis first film, The Prophecy of the Lake (La profec\u00eda del lago), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's  first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's Coraz\u00f3n Aymara (1925). The Prophecy of the Lake was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its \"social critique\" and \"because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films, Wara Wara (1930) and Hacia la Gloria (1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and Wara Wara remains \"the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent-film era\". He also made short documentary films, \"before returning to music\".From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad. Among his notable ballets is Amerindia (1940).Maidana was introduced to Dorothy Hood in Mexico. He married Hood in 1946 and during that time, they traveled, following his conducting jobs which took them between Mexico City, New York and Houston, Texas.In the 1960s, Maidana had to quit conducting because he was showing signs of Parkinson's disease.

He was the State Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management from 2015 to 2017. He was the Deputy Minister of Tourism and Sports in the United National Party 100 days government. Senanayake served as acting Foreign Minister when the Minister Ravi Karunanayake resigned on 10 August 2017. Vasantha Senanayake as state minister foreign affairs developed a close friendship with Lord Naseby of the UK House of Lords and supported vociferously the English Peer's condemnation of the characterization of the war and the Sri Lankan military.During the 2018 Sri Lanka constitutional crisis, Senanayake, a Member of Parliament elected on the United National Party's Polonnaruwa District ticket in 2015, switched his alliance on multiple occasions between the two political parties that were battling for power. Initially he pledged his support for Mahinda Rajapaksa who appointed him as Minister of Tourism and Wildlife after controversially dismissing prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Senanayake then returned his alliance to the United National Party, announcing his resignation from his ministerial portfolio, but later supported Rajapaksa again. This turbulence which Senanayake faced in his second term in Parliament moving between the UNP, the party of his ancestors and the Rajapakse camp may be attributed to his dilemma. Which can be attributed to him of wanting to belong to the \u2018Old UNP\u2019 but fiercely attempting to resist and depose its present occupant and leader of four decades Ranil Wickremasinghe. Wickremasinghe remains in office today after leading the UNP to its worst ever defeat in which the party secured no elected seats and Wickremasinghe scrambled in on a single National List seat the party had secured. He went on to be appointed president of Sri Lanka following the peoples uprising and Gotabhaya Rajapaksha\u2019s resignation in 2022.Senanayake suggested early in his parliamentary career that the imposition of an overly powerful executive presidency on a Westminster type parliament was likely to cause repercussions in Parliament's role, human rights and national policy and rule of law. He submitted a model constitution for the reflections of the select committee. In parliament he has been an active lobbyist against the alcohol and tobacco industries. He has been espousing the importance of transforming modern sri lanka in to a commercial trading hub giving emphasis to sri lanka\u2019s geographical position. Senanayake also established strong contacts with many countries and world leaders during his tenure in the foreign ministry.Senanayake did not contest for election in 2020, and has been spending much of his time writing.

Barrett was educated at Ballyea National School and St Flannan's College in Ennis. He studied engineering at University College Galway, though did not complete his studies. He was a cadet in the Irish Army and later worked as a rate collector and an auctioneer.He was elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 14 March 1968 at the by-election in the Clare constituency, held following the death of Fine Gael TD William Murphy. Barrett topped the poll at the general election the following year. At the 1973 general election Fianna F\u00e1il lost office to a Fine Gael\u2013Labour Party coalition government under Liam Cosgrave, and Barrett was appointed to the party's front bench as spokesperson on Transport and Power. After Fianna F\u00e1il's landslide victory at the 1977 general election he was appointed to the cabinet as Minister for the Environment.\nBarrett supported George Colley in the 1979 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election. Charles Haughey was the eventual victor, but Barrett was retained in the cabinet in the Environment position. Following a reshuffle in 1980 he was appointed Minister for Defence. After the February 1982 general election Fianna F\u00e1il were returned to office, but Barrett was not appointed to cabinet. However, he was appointed a Minister of State at the Department of Finance.\nIn October 1982, when Charlie McCreevy put down a motion of no confidence in Haughey's leadership, Barrett was the only Minister of State among the so-called Gang of 22 who supported it; Haughey survived, and did not dismiss Barrett from office.The following month he topped the poll at the November 1982 general election. Fianna F\u00e1il were out of government again, and Barrett was appointed to the front bench as spokesperson on Defence. He remained there until 1984, when he won a seat in the Munster constituency at the European Parliament election and was replaced on the front bench by Noel Treacy. He did not contest either the 1987 general election or the 1989 European Parliament election, and retired from politics. He died on 8 May 2002.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The joint premiers for Canada West during this period were William Henry Draper (1846 to 1847) and then Henry Sherwood (1847).\nPapineau was part of the interconnected Papineau, Viger, and Cherrier families, who were politically active during the early to mid-19th century in Lower Canada (now Quebec).  His father, Joseph Papineau, and his uncle, Andr\u00e9 Papineau, had both been members of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada.  His older brother, Louis-Joseph Papineau, was a leader of the Patriote movement leading up to the Lower Canada Rebellion.

Two years later, in 1844, Viger invited Papineau to join his new government.  Papineau became the Commissioner of Crown Lands with a seat in the Executive Council. When Viger withdrew from politics in 1846, Papineau succeeded him as joint premier from Canada East. Papineau in turn retired from politics late in 1847.\nPrior to his political career, Papineau was involved in various commercial activities. He was the manager of the family seigneury of Petite-Nation, first for his father, then for his brother Louis-Joseph.

Early in the summer Bernart d'Auriac inaugurated the political debate by coming to the defence of the \"three kings\" Philip III of France, Philip of Navarre, and Charles of Valois, who claimed the Crown of Aragon. Under the direction of the French king they invaded Catalonia in the so-called \"Aragonese Crusade\". After Peter III of Aragon responded to Bernart, Pere responded to Peter in the short piece Senher, reys qu'enamoratz par.\nPere appears to have gotten his nickname from his occupation as a caballero salvaje or cavaller salvatge in the king's house. As such, he acted as messenger and herald. Among his duties was directing the battle cry when the king's armies went to war. Pere is first mentioned by name in 1280 as a juglar del rey (\"jongleur of the king\").

He was born in Vienna in 1904 and received his Ph.D. there in 1927.  In the late 1920s he emigrated to the United States.  In 1935 he founded the Saxl Instrument Company, which designed and manufactured tension meters for use in the textile industry, and later in other industries.  The company, which Saxl ran jointly with his wife, Lucretia Hildreth Saxl, from their home in Harvard, Massachusetts, was renamed Tensitron in 1953.  Saxl is reported as having stated that he worked under Albert Einstein.  He died in 1981.Saxl is most well known for a series of controversial experiments in which he measured unexpected changes in the period of a torsion pendulum under various conditions.  In one series of experiments, the period of a torsion pendulum situated inside a Faraday cage, with the pendulum and the cage connected by a conducting path, was observed to increase as the voltage on the cage was increased.  In another experiment, the period of the pendulum was seen to increase during an eclipse.  Saxl is reported to have attempted, without success, to get this work published in the Physical Review; eventually the work was published in Nature.In the early 1960s, Saxl began a collaboration with Mildred Allen of Mount Holyoke College.  In 1971,  Saxl and Allen published a report of  anomalous changes in the period of a torsion pendulum during a solar eclipse in 1970 and hypothesized that \u201cgravitational theory needs to be modified\u201d.  In addition, they observed unexplained diurnal variation in the period of the pendulum.  None of the effects observed by Saxl and Allen have obvious explanations in terms of well-established theories of gravity and electromagnetism.  Although more subtle explanations, still using conventional physical theory, have been proffered there does not appear to be general agreement as to the cause of the anomalies.  Saxl and Allen's claim that general relativity must be modified, and earlier claims of a similar nature by Allais based on observations of anomalies in the behaviour of a paraconical pendulum, have not won acceptance by the physics community, and recent attempts to reproduce the phenomena have not been successful.", "hasanswer": true}]}

During that action, he distinguished himself by capturing the enemy flag and was promoted to lieutenant for his service, receiving a mention in the official report on the battle. Afterwards, Cervera took part in expeditions mapping the hundreds of islands of the Philippine archipelago, which became useful to sailors navigating the area. In 1865 he returned to the Spanish homeland and got married.Due to the political instability that persisted in Spain since Napoleon's invasion, Cervera took part in putting down the Cantonal rebellion during one of the Carlist Wars. He later commanded the schooner Circe and the corvette Santa Lucia back in the Philippines, where Cervera again took part in operations against insurgents. In 1876 the Spanish captain was appointed as the Governor of Jolo, although he later contracted malaria because of the conditions there and barely survived, returning to Madrid to report on the conditions in the Philippines shortly after that at the request of Prime Minister Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo.

Later, Cervera was deployed to the Spanish Philippines, where, under the command of Admiral Casto M\u00e9ndez N\u00fa\u00f1ez, in September 1864 he took part in the storming of Fort Pagalungan against the Moro rebels. During that action, he distinguished himself by capturing the enemy flag and was promoted to lieutenant for his service, receiving a mention in the official report on the battle. Afterwards, Cervera took part in expeditions mapping the hundreds of islands of the Philippine archipelago, which became useful to sailors navigating the area. In 1865 he returned to the Spanish homeland and got married.Due to the political instability that persisted in Spain since Napoleon's invasion, Cervera took part in putting down the Cantonal rebellion during one of the Carlist Wars. He later commanded the schooner Circe and the corvette Santa Lucia back in the Philippines, where Cervera again took part in operations against insurgents. In 1876 the Spanish captain was appointed as the Governor of Jolo, although he later contracted malaria because of the conditions there and barely survived, returning to Madrid to report on the conditions in the Philippines shortly after that at the request of Prime Minister Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo. C\u00e1novas asked Cervera to take up the post of Minister of the Navy, but Cervera refused, saying that he preferred to be at sea rather than at a desk job. In 1879, he was given command of the training corvette Ferolana, where he remained until 1882, when he was transferred to oversee the Cartagena naval base. From 1885 to 1890, he served on the shipbuilding commission of the battleship Pelayo and became its first commander, but had to fight against the bureaucratic procedures of the Spanish Navy that caused delays in her construction.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_38619", "text": "In May 1891, the Queen Regent Mar\u00eda Cristina assigned Cervera to her court as her naval aide-de-camp. A year later the captain was assigned to oversee the construction of several cruisers for the Spanish Navy at the request of the Queen Regent. Around that time multiple politicians wanted Cervera to become the Minister of the Navy, but he continued to resist because he detested politics. Finally, in 1892, Prime Minister Pr\u00e1xedes Mateo Sagasta asked the Queen Regent to compel him to accept the position of naval minister in his government. She did so, and Cervera reluctantly accepted, being promoted to Contraalmirante (rear admiral). But the newly promoted flag officer made the prime minister promise to not lower the naval budget in return, which Mateo accepted. However, it was not long before the prime minister broke that promise and so Cervera resigned from the position in 1892, but not before trying to make efforts to improve the Spanish Navy's efficiency. The rear admiral was appointed as the naval attach\u00e9 in London shortly afterwards, where he witnessed the technical innovations being made by the British Royal Navy, a post he held until the situation in Cuba began escalating around 1896\u201397.", "hasanswer": false}]}

La France de Bordeaux wrote: \"The La Roche-sur-Yon group produced such results that the Nantes group will organize a similar service.\" Le Temps of 18 August published separate press releases from the La Roche Esperanto group and from the Le Mans Esperanto club on the issue of soldiers missing in action.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills, intelligence, and beauty. She overthrew her husband, becoming a \"femme fatale\" figure in plays and literature over the years, usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and manipulative figure.\nIsabella arrived in England at age 12 during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful baronial factions. Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his favourite, Piers Gaveston, but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. After the death of Gaveston at the hands of the barons in 1312, however, Edward turned to a new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and attempted to take revenge on the barons, resulting in the Despenser War and a period of internal repression across England. Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser, and by 1325, her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point.\nTravelling to France on a diplomatic mission, Isabella may have begun an affair with Roger Mortimer, and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small mercenary army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King's forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming regent on behalf of her young son, Edward III. Some believe that Isabella then arranged the murder of Edward II. Isabella and Mortimer's regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the war with Scotland.\nIn 1330, aged 18, Isabella's son, Edward III forcibly asserted his authority. Mortimer was executed, Isabella's regency was ended and she was imprisoned, but soon released.

The French chronicler Guillaume de Nangis and English chronicler Thomas Walsingham describe her as 12 years old at the time of her marriage in January 1308, placing her birth between January 1295 and of 1296. A papal dispensation by Clement V in November 1305 permitted her immediate marriage by proxy, despite the fact that she was probably only 10 years old. Since her brother Charles was born on 18 June 1294, and she had to reach the canonical age of 12 before her marriage in January 1308, the evidence suggests that she was born between April 1295 and January 1296. Her parents were King Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre; her brothers Louis, Philip and Charles became kings of France.Isabella was born into a royal family that ruled the most powerful state in Western Europe. Her father, King Philip, known as \"le Bel\" (the Fair) because of his alleged good looks, was a strangely unemotional man; one contemporary described him as \"neither a man nor a beast, but a statue\"; modern historians have noted that he \"cultivated a reputation for Christian kingship and showed few weaknesses of the flesh\". Philip built up centralised royal power in France, engaging in a sequence of conflicts to expand or consolidate French authority across the region, but remained chronically short of money throughout his reign. Indeed, he appeared almost obsessed about building up wealth and lands, something that his daughter was also accused of in later life. Isabella's mother died when Isabella was still quite young; some contemporaries suspected Philip IV of her murder, albeit probably incorrectly.\nIsabella was brought up in and around the Louvre Palace and the Palais de la Cit\u00e9 in Paris. Isabella was cared for by Th\u00e9ophania de Saint-Pierre, her nurse, given a good education and taught to read, developing a love of books. As was customary for the period, all of Philip's children were married young for political benefit. Isabella was promised in marriage by her father to Edward, the son of King Edward I of England, with the intention to resolve the conflicts between France and England over the latter's continental possession of Gascony and claims to Anjou, Normandy and Aquitaine. Pope Boniface VIII had urged the marriage as early as 1298 but it was delayed by wrangling over the terms of the marriage contract. The renewal of the Anglo-French truce in 1299 led to the marriage of Edward I to Philip's sister Margaret, further anticipating the marriage of Isabella to Edward II.

His father Charles North was a draper who together with his wife Fanny kept a shop in the area. They had three children apart from John \u2013 Charles, Fanny and Alfred. Little is known of John's early schooling, although he claimed to have been an avid reader from the age of 6 years. He left school at the age of 12.\nDue to a downturn in business, John's father was forced to shut up shop and relocate the business to Worthing (on the Sussex coast). After the business failed again, John's parents decided to emigrate with the youngest son Alfred to Canada. It is thought that John (then 14) and his two siblings, Charles and Fanny, were looked after by various relatives including an uncle in Walham Green, and a great uncle who owned a farm near Kimpton in Hertfordshire.\nHe showed artistic ability at a young age and received some training at art school as well as instruction from a local artist called Hackman. At the age of 10 he completed his first watercolour, The Thames from Wandsworth, which was subsequently exhibited by the Royal Watercolour Society in 1919. A number of other watercolours and sketches were also completed in his teens.\nAt the age of 16, he was apprenticed to produce illustrations for the notable London-based wood engraver Josiah Whymper. There North became friends with Frederick Walker, Arthur Boyd Houghton and George John Pinwell, who would later become associated with the Idyllic school. He worked \u2013 using a brush and pencil \u2013 on black and white illustrations for various publications, gaining a reputation for the quality of his landscapes.In 1868 he moved to Somerset, renting a room at Halsway Manor near Crowcombe \u2013 his friend and fellow artist Frederick Walker also lived there. North's vivid watercolour of Halsway Manor, from 1865, is in the  British Museum, London.  In 1866 North's parents returned from Canada and he became the main provider for the whole family. North moved to the village of Woolston in 1869.\nThe period 1860\u201367 brought both artistic success as an illustrator and financial security. North was also developing his skill as a watercolourist, so much so that in 1867 he decided to pursue his painting full-time and abandon his illustration work. He made his debut at the Royal Academy in 1869 with four watercolours, including The Wood Gatherers (1869; Cleveland Museum of Art). In the subsequent years up to 1887, he divided his time painting between Somerset, a studio in London, and a house in Algeria. North exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery and the New Gallery and was a member of Arts Club. He was eventually accepted as a member of the Royal Watercolour Society (RWS) and an associate of the Royal Academy (ARA).\nIn 1884 North married the 21-year-old Selina Weetch at Bicknoller Church in Somerset, setting up home in Beggearn Huish House in Nettlecombe. They went on to have six children, including Roland Arthur Charles North. Selina died in 1898.\nNorth became friends with the essayist Richard Jefferies in 1883 until the latter's death in 1887. Subsequently, North was involved in setting up a fund for Jefferies' widow and family, and invited them to stay at his home in Somerset, even arranging for the education of Jefferies' son Harold.\nIn 1895, North started the O.W. Paper & Arts Co. featuring fine papers for art printing and watercolor.In personality and politics North was a liberal, publicly championing the cause of social justice for the agricultural labouring class. He opposed the enclosure of common lands, campaigned for decent rural sanitation and for social housing.\nNorth died at Stamborough, Somerset in 1924, and is buried in the New Cemetery at Nettlecombe.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_38943", "text": "The term \"idyllist\" is more properly applied to North's earlier black and white landscapes, which were driven by the necessity to illustrate a particular literary narrative.

In this North owed a lot to his friend Richard Jefferies, and biographer Herbert Alexander noted that North had to be in the right state of mind before he would start a painting.In 1895, North helped to develop a new, kind of linen-based art paper that was extraordinarily durable and ideally suited to the demands of the watercolourist. He experimented with this paper for the rest of his life and was able to develop a very detailed painting style using ordinary watercolor paint and no gouache.

It is thought that John (then 14) and his two siblings, Charles and Fanny, were looked after by various relatives including an uncle in Walham Green, and a great uncle who owned a farm near Kimpton in Hertfordshire.\nHe showed artistic ability at a young age and received some training at art school as well as instruction from a local artist called Hackman. At the age of 10 he completed his first watercolour, The Thames from Wandsworth, which was subsequently exhibited by the Royal Watercolour Society in 1919. A number of other watercolours and sketches were also completed in his teens.\nAt the age of 16, he was apprenticed to produce illustrations for the notable London-based wood engraver Josiah Whymper. There North became friends with Frederick Walker, Arthur Boyd Houghton and George John Pinwell, who would later become associated with the Idyllic school. He worked \u2013 using a brush and pencil \u2013 on black and white illustrations for various publications, gaining a reputation for the quality of his landscapes.In 1868 he moved to Somerset, renting a room at Halsway Manor near Crowcombe \u2013 his friend and fellow artist Frederick Walker also lived there. North's vivid watercolour of Halsway Manor, from 1865, is in the  British Museum, London.  In 1866 North's parents returned from Canada and he became the main provider for the whole family. North moved to the village of Woolston in 1869.\nThe period 1860\u201367 brought both artistic success as an illustrator and financial security. North was also developing his skill as a watercolourist, so much so that in 1867 he decided to pursue his painting full-time and abandon his illustration work. He made his debut at the Royal Academy in 1869 with four watercolours, including The Wood Gatherers (1869; Cleveland Museum of Art). In the subsequent years up to 1887, he divided his time painting between Somerset, a studio in London, and a house in Algeria. North exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery and the New Gallery and was a member of Arts Club. He was eventually accepted as a member of the Royal Watercolour Society (RWS) and an associate of the Royal Academy (ARA).\nIn 1884 North married the 21-year-old Selina Weetch at Bicknoller Church in Somerset, setting up home in Beggearn Huish House in Nettlecombe. They went on to have six children, including Roland Arthur Charles North. Selina died in 1898.\nNorth became friends with the essayist Richard Jefferies in 1883 until the latter's death in 1887. Subsequently, North was involved in setting up a fund for Jefferies' widow and family, and invited them to stay at his home in Somerset, even arranging for the education of Jefferies' son Harold.\nIn 1895, North started the O.W. Paper & Arts Co. featuring fine papers for art printing and watercolor.In personality and politics North was a liberal, publicly championing the cause of social justice for the agricultural labouring class. He opposed the enclosure of common lands, campaigned for decent rural sanitation and for social housing.\nNorth died at Stamborough, Somerset in 1924, and is buried in the New Cemetery at Nettlecombe.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_38943", "text": "The term \"idyllist\" is more properly applied to North's earlier black and white landscapes, which were driven by the necessity to illustrate a particular literary narrative. His later watercolour work was certainly not idyllist in the nostalgic, \"chocolate-box art\" sense of the word, but attempted to evoke a sense of spiritual communion with nature. In this North owed a lot to his friend Richard Jefferies, and biographer Herbert Alexander noted that North had to be in the right state of mind before he would start a painting.In 1895, North helped to develop a new, kind of linen-based art paper that was extraordinarily durable and ideally suited to the demands of the watercolourist. He experimented with this paper for the rest of his life and was able to develop a very detailed painting style using ordinary watercolor paint and no gouache. He built up his forms by applying the paints in very small dots and touches of pure colour \u2013 a technique predating pointillism by a decade.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Between 1913 and 1920 William (Bill) worked as a reporter for a Reading, Pennsylvania newspaper.  He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1920 and started work for William Randolph Hearst's International News Service (INS).  As an INS reporter, he covered the John T. Scopes trial, also known as the  Scopes Trial, in Dayton, Tennessee and on July 24, 1925 he was the first reporter to file the dispatch stating the outcome.  A conversation that occurred during the last days of the trial, Scopes said:\n\"There's something I must tell you. It's worried me. I didn't violate the law ...I never taught that evolution lesson. I skipped it. I was doing something else the day I should have taught it, and I missed the whole lesson about Darwin and never did teach it. Those kids they put on the stand couldn't remember what I taught them three months ago. They were coached by the lawyers.\" \"Honest, I've been scared all through the trial that the kids might remember I missed the lesson. I was afraid they'd get on the stand and say I hadn't taught it and then the whole trial would go blooey. If that happened they would run me out of town on a rail.\"When Bill mentioned that would make a great news story, John responded, \"My god no! Not a word of it until the Supreme Court passes my appeal. My lawyers would kill me.\"  In L. Sprague de Camp's book, The Great Monkey Trial, de Camp goes on to say that Bill claimed he overheard Clarence Darrow coaching the students on what to say, however, even with coaching, only one of the students implied that Scopes taught evolution.Bill also covered the national political conventions and events in the Capitol.  In 1939 he was the Bureau Chief of the International News Service in Washington, D.C.  In late 1949, during a game of hearts, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Bill came up with the idea for a list of names, photographs, and descriptions of the ten worst criminals wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  On March 14, 1950, the list was compiled and distributed as the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list.Following his transatlantic solo flight and return to the United States in 1927, Charles Lindbergh gave his flight jacket to Bill.  He wore this jacket on many outings and kept it until his death.  The jacket was then willed to his brother Herb.  By the time of Herb's death in 1986,  the jacket had so deteriorated that it was mistakenly thrown out by someone who did not realize its historic value.Bill was a member of the bar in the District of Columbia and wrote two books, Life and Works of William E. Borah and Ten Days that Changed the World, the latter being an account of the ten days between the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan. For many years he was owner and the Vice President of the Washington Redskins football team.  A World War I veteran, Bill received numerous awards from the Air Force, Army, and Navy for patriotic service.Bill was the president of the Senate Press Gallery for over 20 years.  As a token of appreciation for Bill's aid in having the Congressional press galleries renovated, the standing committee of House and Senate correspondents today presented a silver punch bowl to William K. Hutchinson of International News Service. In the photo, taken at the Capitol on 25-FEB-1938, Hutchinson is shown receiving the bowl from Nathan Robertson (right) of King Features who is Chairman of the committee.He died the day after the announcement of the merger of the International News Service with the United Press to form United Press International.  On May 26, 1958 the funeral was held with Vice President Richard Nixon as one of the pallbearers.  Bill was awarded the lifetime District of Columbia license plate number \"53\" which upon his death in 1958, was willed to John Willard Marriott.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

He held office as the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), of which he was the longest-serving. He was notable for being the head of a reformist and socially progressive administration that ended with his removal as prime minister after controversially being dismissed by the governor-general of Australia, Sir John Kerr, at the climax of the 1975 constitutional crisis. Whitlam is the only Australian prime minister to have been removed from office by the governor-general.\nWhitlam was an air navigator in the Royal Australian Air Force for four years during World War II, and worked as a barrister following the war. He was first elected to the Australian House of Representatives in 1952, becoming a member of parliament (MP) for the division of Werriwa. Whitlam became deputy leader of the Labor Party in 1960, and in 1967, after the retirement of Arthur Calwell, was elected leader of the party and became the Leader of the Opposition. After narrowly losing the 1969 federal election to John Gorton, Whitlam  led Labor to victory at the 1972 election, after 23 years of continuous Coalition government.\nIn its first term, the Whitlam government introduced numerous socially progressive and reformist policies and initiatives, including the termination of military conscription and the end of Australian involvement in the Vietnam War, institution of universal health care and free university education, and the implementation of legal aid programmes. With the opposition-controlled Australian Senate delaying passage of bills, Whitlam called a snap double dissolution election in May 1974 in which he won a slightly reduced majority in the House of Representatives, and picked up three Senate seats to hold equal Senate numbers to the opposition. The Whitlam government then instituted the first and only joint sitting enabled under section 57 of the Australian constitution as part of the double dissolution process. His government's second term was dominated by a declining economy suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and the 1970s global recession, as well as a political scandal known as the Loans affair, which led to the removal of two government ministers. The opposition continued to obstruct Whitlam's agenda in the Senate.\nIn late 1975, the opposition senators refused to allow a vote on the government's appropriation bills, returning them to the House of Representatives with a demand that the government go to an election, thus denying the government supply. Whitlam refused to agree to the request, arguing that his government, which held a clear majority in the House of Representatives, was being held to ransom by the Senate. The crisis ended in mid-November, when governor-general Sir John Kerr dismissed him from office and commissioned the opposition leader, Malcolm Fraser, as caretaker prime minister. Labor lost the subsequent election by a landslide. Whitlam stepped down as leader of the party after losing again at the 1977 election, and retired from parliament the following year. Upon the election of the Hawke government in 1983, he was appointed as Ambassador to UNESCO, a position he filled with distinction, and was elected a member of the UNESCO Executive Board. He remained active into his nineties. The propriety and circumstances of his dismissal and the legacy of his government have been frequently debated in the decades since he left office. Whitlam is often ranked in the upper-tier of Australian prime ministers by political experts and academics, with political journalist Paul Kelly writing in 1994 that \"there is no doubt that in three years his government was responsible for more reforms and innovations than any other government in Australian history\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "106_39060", "text": "Edward Gough Whitlam was born on 11 July 1916 at the family home 'Ngara', 46 Rowland Street, Kew, a suburb of Melbourne, the elder of two children (his sister, Freda, was born four years after him), to Martha (n\u00e9e Maddocks) and Fred Whitlam.

She specifically criticized the ICTY Appeals Chamber for improperly denying victims of mass atrocities the ability to access information critical to their ability to obtain reparations for crimes committed against them and their relatives. She argued that the war documents censored by the ICTY should have been made available during a separate trial at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in which Bosnia unsuccessfully tried to sue Serbia for genocide, because they could not prove a direct link between Belgrade and war crimes committed in Bosnia \u2013 most notably the massacre of up to 8,000 Bosniak men and boys around Srebrenica in 1995.The Tribunal decision to grant confidentiality for the key portions of Belgrade war documents acknowledged that disclosure would harm Serbia's \"vital national interests\" by failing to protect Serbia from having to pay damages to Bosnia in Bosnia's suit then-pending at the ICJ.The issue at trial was whether the information she disclosed \u2013 \"the existence and the purported effect\" of the two impugned confidential decisions of the ICTY Appeals Chamber's dated 20 September 2005 and 6 April 2006 \u2013 was confidential or whether only the key evidence Serbia sought to censor was protected by a Court order.On 14 September 2009, the ICTY found Hartmann guilty of contempt of court and was sentenced to pay a \u20ac7,000 (\u00a36,100) fine for disclosing information relating to the two confidential ICTY Court orders that deprive victims and public from access to documents on Serbia's involvement in planning and executing the Srebrenica genocide in 1995. While the Chamber found that \"some protected information disclosed by the Accused in her publications was indeed in the public domain\", it considered that she disclosed \"more information, notably the legal reasoning applied by the Appeals Chamber in reaching its dispositions, as well as the purported effects of both Appeals Chamber decisions\".She was convicted on these grounds of violating two appellate orders dated 20 September 2005 and 6 April 2006 issued in the Slobodan Milosevi\u0107 case before the ICTY.On 24 September 2009, Hartmann launched an appeal against the conviction. The London-based international NGO called Article 19, which is dedicated to the protection and promotion of freedom of speech submitted an amicus curiae brief, calling the ICTY Appeals Chamber to apply the international standards allegedly disregarded by the Trial Chamber.On 19 July 2011, the ICTY Appeals Chamber dismissed all the grounds of appeal advanced by Hartmann and confirmed the conviction, limiting it exclusively to the \"disclosure of the legal reasoning of the two impugned confidential decisions\". The imposition of the \u20ac7,000 fine was upheld.In March 2011, prior to the issuing of the appeal judgement against Hartmann, the impugned confidential decisions criticized by Hartmann were turned down. Most of the critical documents provided by Belgrade for the trial of Slobodan Milosevi\u0107 in relation to which confidentiality orders had initially been made were released by the ICTY and admitted as public evidence in the ICTY case against Mom\u010dilo Peri\u0161i\u0107, former Yugoslav Army chief of staff. The only information pertaining to the 2005 and 2006 confidentiality Court orders that still remains protected is therefore the Appeals Chamber's legal reasoning. However, no ban was ordered in the ICTY Appeal judgment in relation to the three impugned pages of her book or her articles.In reaction to Hartmann's conviction by the ICTY, several international NGOs have criticized the ICTY for hiding its \"legal reasoning\" while the publicity of criminal proceedings is a general principle of criminal and international law which aim is to guarantee the transparency and public control of judicial proceedings. Reporters Without Borders and Article 19 condemned a conviction contravening international case law relating to freedom of expression.Reporters Without Borders stated that \"it is the duty of the press to highlight how this internationally created system of justice works, to question its procedures and to stimulate public discussion\". \"Article 19 believes that such an insistence on keeping the logic and effect of the ICTY's jurisprudence secret is profoundly undemocratic and manifestly inappropriate for an international criminal court\", adding that \"[t]o impose such a penalty on a journalist for bringing transparency and accountability to the ICTY raises troubling questions about the Tribunal's democratic legitimacy\".The \u20ac7,000 fine was deposited by Hartmann into a French dedicated bank account along with an invitation to the ICTY to seek assistance to the French authorities in order to collect these funds for the purposes of paying the fine. The ICTY Appeals Chamber deemed the money not to have been paid and converted, on 16 November 2011, the \u20ac7,000 fine into a seven-day prison term. An arrest warrant for contempt of court was issued by the ICTY on the same day, ordering France to transfer immediately Hartmann to The Hague and the Netherlands to assist in taking her to the United Nations detention unit. The French government refused to extradite Hartmann and informed the ICTY of this refusal on 27 December 2011.In November 2011, Reporters Without Borders urged the French judiciary to determine the validity of the arrest warrant and to consider the merits of the case in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. \"The European Court of Human Rights has consistently emphasized the public interest in the reporting of legal issues. It would be illogical and dangerous if international justice was exempt.\"On 30 November 2011, Article 19 denounced the unlawfulness of the arrest warrant and \"calls on all states, particularly the French and Dutch authorities, to avoid complicity in this perversion of international justice and to resist carrying out the order\". Article 19 insisted that the human rights guarantees enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should take priority over the ICTY and recalled that under the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, French authorities as well as the authorities of the 46 other member states to the European Convention are obliged to verify the legality of the ICTY orders which they are asked to execute.Hartmann began petitioning Frank La Rue, United Nations Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Opinion and Expression, and Dunja Mijatovi\u0107, the Representative for Freedom of the Media of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), on 30 November. As there is no appeal before an independent jurisdiction from a decision of the ICTY, Hartmann is seeking from the Special Rapporteurs a judgement that the ICTY decision against her violates international standards of protection of the right of freedom of expression and that upholding or executing the arrest warrant against her would constitute a further violation of this right. Reporters Without Borders called on both rapporteurs to remind international courts that they are subject to international norms, especially those concerning freedom of expression, noting that \"[b]eyond the Hartmann case itself, the decision to penalize criticism of an international tribunal is a dangerous precedent for all those working in the media.\"On 24 March 2016, Hartmann was arrested by UN guards as she gave an interview near the war crimes tribunal building.

She specifically criticized the ICTY Appeals Chamber for improperly denying victims of mass atrocities the ability to access information critical to their ability to obtain reparations for crimes committed against them and their relatives.

The period she opened was a booming time for landscape architects with work from country estates with much planning and construction to create outbuildings and large gardens, commissioned by the new rich after World War I. The firm employed a secretary, an assistant, and two drafters and was located in an office in downtown Washington and worked in mostly Virginia, Washington, and Maryland. She designed more than 500 landscapes in her forty-year career, specializing in residential design but emphasized the integral relationship between buildings and their surroundings.Greely worked on the staff of House Beautiful and in 1932, wrote the series \"Why Should the Garden Have Design?\" The series detailed her design philosophy, about Beaux-Art, Arts and Crafts, harmony, regional styles, native plant material and craft details. She felt that planting should echo the character of the architecture and that the landscape should emphasize the dominant points of the house and accentuate the beauty of an architectural element. Greely's designs for small city gardens were enclosed spaces, scaled with the house which made connections with the indoor space. Country estates were designed through a set of \"rooms\" emphasizing the landscape's vastness to create a parklike experience. Her suburban designs frequently featured a step-down entrance on the sidewalk, and a smaller set of \"rooms\" for differing activities.

The firm employed a secretary, an assistant, and two drafters and was located in an office in downtown Washington and worked in mostly Virginia, Washington, and Maryland. She designed more than 500 landscapes in her forty-year career, specializing in residential design but emphasized the integral relationship between buildings and their surroundings.Greely worked on the staff of House Beautiful and in 1932, wrote the series \"Why Should the Garden Have Design?\" The series detailed her design philosophy, about Beaux-Art, Arts and Crafts, harmony, regional styles, native plant material and craft details. She felt that planting should echo the character of the architecture and that the landscape should emphasize the dominant points of the house and accentuate the beauty of an architectural element. Greely's designs for small city gardens were enclosed spaces, scaled with the house which made connections with the indoor space. Country estates were designed through a set of \"rooms\" emphasizing the landscape's vastness to create a parklike experience. Her suburban designs frequently featured a step-down entrance on the sidewalk, and a smaller set of \"rooms\" for differing activities.
