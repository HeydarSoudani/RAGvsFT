The group were among the first African American performers to attain a crossover following.The Jackson 5 performed in talent shows and clubs on the Chitlin' Circuit, then signed with Steeltown Records in 1967 and released two singles. In 1968, they left Steeltown Records and signed with Motown, where they were the first group to debut with four consecutive number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with the songs \"I Want You Back\", \"ABC\", \"The Love You Save\", and \"I'll Be There\". They also achieved sixteen Top-40 singles on the chart. The group left Motown for Epic Records in early 1976, with the exception of Jermaine who was replaced by youngest brother Randy. Changing their name to the Jacksons upon signing with Epic, they released four studio albums and one live album between 1976 and 1981, including the successful albums Destiny (1978) and Triumph (1980) and the singles \"Enjoy Yourself\", \"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\", and \"Can You Feel It\".\nThe brothers also released solo albums, most successfully Michael.

{"id": "740_46", "question": "Where was Locomotive founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_58794", "text": "During 1839, Invicta was withdrawn from use upon the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway as a consequence of the decision to concentrate on using stationary engines for pulling trains instead, which had proved to be both adequate for the line's working and less troubled by a lack of power as the locomotive had been. While she was offered for sale by the company in October 1839, no buyer was ultimately found for it. As a result, Invicta was instead put under cover at Canterbury North Lane station. She came into the ownership of the South Eastern Railway in 1844 and was soon relocated to Ashford Works, minus her original two-wheeled tender. She was thus the first locomotive to be preserved; over the following years, she began to serve as a physical marker of the pioneering days of rail travel. During 1875, Invicta was exhibited at the Golden Jubilee of the Stockton and Darlington Railway; she also made an appearance at the Newcastle Stephenson Centenary in 1881.During 1892, it is believed that work was begun upon its restoration; few details on this process are known. Subsequently, Invicta was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, France, in 1900. In 1906, Invicta was presented to the city of Canterbury by David Lionel Goldsmid-Stern-Salomons, a director of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. For 70 years, Invicta was put on static display in the Dane John Gardens, Canterbury. At some point during this time, it is believed that she was given a red coat of paint. It was not until 1977 that a full cosmetic restoration of the locomotive was undertaken, with help from the National Railway Museum, where she was transported by road. This work included her ironwork being painted black and the installation of timber cladding around the boiler barrel. Following the completion of this restoration, Invicta returned to Canterbury in time for the 150th anniversary of the Canterbury & Whitstable Railway on 3 May 1980.Presently, the cosmetically restored Invicta is owned by the Transport Trust; it had been loaned for many years to the Canterbury Heritage Museum, where it had been on display prior to the museum's closure in 2017. During November 2008, it was announced that a \u00a341,000 Heritage Lottery Fund planning grant had been made to Canterbury City Council to develop a new museum at Whitstable to house Invicta, as well as a stationary winding engine that was built at Robert Stephenson's works. In the months after Canterbury Heritage Museum closed down, the long term residence of Invicta was a topic of considerable debate, during which numerous museums petitioned to have it in their collections. Invicta was lifted in to its new home at the Whitstable Museum and Gallery on 16 June 2019.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1976, Garrie Lammin (Burge's cousin) joined as second guitarist, and the band met with Malcolm McLaren, who was considering managing Cock Sparrer alongside the Sex Pistols.In 1977, the band secured a deal with Decca Records, who were hoping to cash in on the now blooming punk movement. The first Cock Sparrer single was \"Runnin' Riot\", released in May 1977. It did not sell well, nor did the following single (a cover of the Rolling Stones' \"We Love You\"), and Decca dropped the band in 1978. The band members had already recorded an album's worth of material, which was only released in Spain as Cock Sparrer and was not officially issued in the UK until Razor Records released it in 1987 as True Grit.

Their sound mixes a generally punk rock approach to vocals and sound textures with poppy tunes and strong musicianship.Although these three band members have remained fairly constant, they have gone through numerous drummers, including Duff McKagan, later of Guns N' Roses. MTV's web page on the Fastbacks says that estimates at the number of Fastbacks drummers \"range from 12 to 20.\" For much of the band's heyday, Mike Musburger filled this role, but other Fastbacks drummers before him (or when he took occasional breaks) included Bloch himself, Richard Stuverud (perhaps best known from War Babies, Fifth Angel and his collaborations with Pearl Jam's Jeff Ament, including Three Fish, Tres Mts. and RNDM), Nate Johnson and Rusty Willoughby (both of whom also played in both Flop and Pure Joy), John Moen (of the Dharma Bums, later of Steven Malkmus's Jicks and The Decemberists), Jason Finn (of the Presidents of the United States of America), Dan Peters of Mudhoney, and Tad Hutchison of the Young Fresh Fellows. Several of these people also served at times as drummers in The Squirrels, a similarly long-lived band, and the Fastbacks' sometime label-mates on PopLlama Records, who bring a similar mix of strong musicianship and punk attitude to even poppier material.\nContributing to the band's 2001 breakup was Kim Warnick's move to the band Visqueen in 2001 through 2004.

J. Lawson in 1896, which set up its manufacturing base in Coventry. The company bought the right to the use of the Daimler name simultaneously from Gottlieb Daimler and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft of Cannstatt, Germany. After early financial difficulty and a reorganisation of the company in 1904, the Daimler Motor Company was purchased by Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) in 1910, which also made cars under its own name before the Second World War. In 1933, BSA bought the Lanchester Motor Company and made it a subsidiary of the Daimler Company.\nDaimler was awarded a Royal Warrant to provide cars to the British monarch in 1902; it lost this privilege in the 1950s after being supplanted by Rolls-Royce. Daimler occasionally used alternative technology: the Daimler-Knight engine which it further developed in the early twentieth century and used from 1909 to 1935, the worm gear final drive fitted from 1909 until after the Second World War, and their patented fluid flywheel used in conjunction with a Wilson preselector gearbox from 1930 to the mid-1950s.\nDaimler tried to widen its appeal in the 1950s with a line of smaller cars at one end and opulent show cars at the other, stopped making Lanchesters, had a highly publicised removal of their chairman from the board, and developed and sold a sports car and a high-performance luxury saloon and limousine. BSA sold Daimler to Jaguar Cars in 1960, and Jaguar briefly continued Daimler's line adding a Daimler variant of its Mark II sports saloon. Jaguar was then merged into the British Motor Corporation in 1966 and British Leyland in 1968. Under these companies, Daimler became an upscale trim level for Jaguar cars except for the 1968\u20131992 Daimler DS420 limousine, which had no Jaguar equivalent despite being fully Jaguar-based. When Jaguar Cars was split off from British Leyland in 1984, it retained the Daimler company and brand.\nFord bought Jaguar Cars in 1990 and under Ford it stopped using the Daimler marque in 2009 when the last X358 Daimler models were discontinued. The X351 Jaguar XJ took its place and there was no Daimler variant. Jaguar Cars remained in its ownership, and from 2000 accompanied by Land Rover, until they sold both Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors in 2008, who formed Jaguar Land Rover as a subsidiary holding company for them. In 2013, Jaguar Cars was merged with Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover Limited, and the rights to the Daimler car brand were transferred to the newly formed British multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Devices include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Vision Pro, and Apple TV; operating systems include iOS, iPadOS, and macOS; and software applications and services include iTunes, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\nFor most of 2011 to 2024, Apple became the world's largest company by market capitalization until Microsoft assumed the position in January 2024. In 2022, Apple was the largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.3 billion. As of 2023, Apple was the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales, the largest manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company's internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.\nIn 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs's return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\nApple has received criticism regarding its contractors' labor practices, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing.

Paizo publisher Erik Mona is the former editor-in-chief of Dragon, while former editor-in-chief of Dungeon James Jacobs oversees the Pathfinder periodicals.\nThe company started producing a bimonthly magazine called Undefeated in 2003, and in 2004, resurrected the venerable science fiction title Amazing Stories. The two publications were placed on hiatus in 2005, and finally canceled in 2006.In early 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced it would not renew Paizo's license to publish Dragon and Dungeon, leaving a five-year run from September 2002 to September 2007.Paizo's subsequently began the periodical Pathfinder Adventure Path, which continues the concept featured in Dungeon of monthly installments of adventures that tell a self-contained story. These Adventure Paths are set in the world of Golarion, the official Pathfinder campaign setting. \nPaizo announced on March 18, 2008 that they would be launching the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Through the new product line, Paizo would modify and update the System Reference Document version 3.5 under the terms of Wizards of the Coast's Open Gaming License. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game would also support Paizo's Pathfinder campaign setting. In March 2008, Paizo also announced that it was introducing an organized play program called \"Pathfinder Society Organized Play\". The program was loosely modeled on the RPGAs \"Living\" campaigns. Additional products in the Pathfinder line include Pathfinder modules and Pathfinder Tales novels.\nIn May 2016, Paizo announced a new space fantasy role-playing game, Starfinder Roleplaying Game, released in August 2017. It is set in a possible future of the Pathfinder setting where Golarion has disappeared.\nIn May 2018, Paizo announced it was working on a second edition of Pathfinder to refine elements of the rule set to reflect feedback and clarification on the original system over the prior years. The preliminary ruleset was published in August 2018 as Pathfinder Playtest so that players could test out and provide feedback. The final rule set was released on August 1, 2019.On June 15, 2020, Paizo announced CEO Lisa Stevens was going to step down from daily operations in preparation for her retirement.Other Paizo products include the Titanic Games line of board games such as Kill Doctor Lucky, and the Planet Stories line of classic fantasy, science fiction and science fantasy novels.\nOn October 14, 2021, an organization representing over 30 Paizo employees announced the formation of the United Paizo Workers, a labor union allied with the Communications Workers of America, becoming the first such tabletop game company to have such a union. The employees stated that recent issues related to \"managerial impropriety\" was a driver for the unionization effort. Paizo voluntarily agreed to recognize the union, allowing collective bargaining negotiations between the company and union to commence.Leaked documents from Wizard of the Coast in January 2023 suggested that Wizards planned to change the Open Game License (OGL), developed for its Dungeons & Dragons products and which Paizo's products are predicated on, to be more restrictive and potentially harm third-party content creators, including Paizo. In response, Paizo announced plans for a new license called the Open RPG Creative License (ORC). Additional publishers, such as Kobold Press, Chaosium, Green Ronin, Legendary Games, and Rogue Genius Games, will be part of the ORC development process. The ORC will be an open, perpetual, and irrevocable system-agnostic license with legal development paid for by Paizo \"under the legal guidance of Azora Law\", however, the license \"will not be owned by Paizo, nor will it be owned by any company who makes money publishing RPGs\". Paizo plans to find a \"nonprofit with a history of open source values to own this license\" and stated that \"Azora Law's ownership of the process and stewardship should provide a safe harbor against any company being bought, sold, or changing management in the future and attempting to rescind rights or nullify sections of the license\". Polygon reported that \"in the weeks that Hasbro spent publicly flailing, customers spent an extraordinary amount of money investing in its competition\". Paizo stated that it had \"sold through 'an 8-month supply' of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook\" within two weeks; the company also reported high demand for other products such as the Pathfinder Beginner Box.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Shortly after the formation, ex-Nosebleeds drummer Philip \"Toby\" Tomanov and bassist Willie Trotter joined to complete the band. It debuted live at the Factory Club, supporting The Pop Group, in October 1978, recording a studio demo the same month. The following month, Ludus played shows at well-known 'punk' venues like Eric's Club in Liverpool and, travelling with Magazine, The Venue in London.\nSince its live debut at The Factory, Ludus was favourably reviewed in the press. In January 1979, Paul Morley, writing for NME, remarked: \n\nLudus are anything but ordinary. A rich, bewitching quartet, led by the enigmatic Linder, whose maturing, enchanting voice adds layers of mystery, fragility and haunting strength to the esoteric music... Arthur supplies the solids, Linder the shadows; Arthur the rain, Linder the wind. It's a classic combination... The overall mixture is of a precious dance music: Gothic, but not glossily so, like Magazine; impressionistic and expressionistic; compact and exuberant. It's music that chills and warms, with images that scare and comfort... Still young, still unsure onstage, their music is already alone and knowing. And they're getting better all the time. Take good care of them.In February 1979, Ludus returned to the studio to record another demo, produced by Howard Devoto, Linder's boyfriend at the time. Shortly after a brief UK tour supporting Buzzcocks in March 1979, Kadmon and Trotter quit the band. Kadmon later joined The Distractions and Trotter moved onto working in the television industry. Ian Devine replaced them, after which the group began recording for New Hormones and pursued more abstract directions, including jazz, improvisation, and (after moving on to Les Disques du Crepuscule) even French pop. A provocative live performance at The Ha\u00e7ienda club in Manchester on 5 November 1982 saw Linder take the stage dressed in a dress fashioned from raw meat. After a spell in exile in Brussels, the group disbanded in 1983.\nIn October 1985 Morrissey wrote sleevenotes for an (unissued) Crepuscule compilation, and offered this closing eulogy: \"Ludus lay on us the decorative impulses of their music, and nowhere more significantly than on the volume which now lies before you. People who know real genius will love this record... Her singing leaves me out of breath... Linder went to Brussels and I remained stuck in Manchester, battling with the tides of fortune. Our shrill spirits still slide through the ugly streets of Manchester, always wet through, always caught out, always spectating, our hearts damaged by too many air-raids.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Binswanger and Company as an  electrical goods wholesaler based in London. It quickly adopted a then-unorthodox business model of supplying electrical components over the counter. In 1889, the business was incorporated as the General Electric Company Ltd, and became a public limited company 11 years later. During the 1890s and 1900s, the company heavily invested into electric lighting, a sector that would prove to be immensely profitable in the long term. The GEC was heavily impacted by the outbreak of the First World War, supplying various goods to the military, and thus becoming a major player in the electrical industry. In 1921, a new purpose-built company headquarters (Magnet House) was opened in Kingsway, London; two years later, GEC's industrial research laboratories at Wembley (later named the Hirst Research Centre) also opened. In the 1920s, the company was heavily involved in the creation and roll-out of Britain's National Grid.\nDuring the Second World War, GEC made several significant contributions to the Allied war effort, such as the development of the cavity magnetron for radar, various advances in communications technology, and the mass production of valves, lamps, and lighting equipment. In 1961, GEC merged with Radio & Allied Industries. Throughout the mid-to-late 1960s, GEC's new managing director, Arnold Weinstock, sought to rationalise the British electrical industry and boost efficiency via a series of cut-backs and mergers that returned the company to profit. GEC acquired Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) in 1967, and merged with English Electric one year later. The company continued to expand via acquisitions; between 1979 and 1981, GEC acquired W & T Avery, Cincinnati Electronics, and Picker Corporation.\nDuring the 1980s, the company was Britain's largest private employer with over 250,000 employees; becoming one of the first companies in the new FTSE 100 Index in 1984. It made profits in excess of \u00a31 billion per year at its peak in the 1990s. In June 1998, GEC sold its share of the joint venture GEC-Alsthom on the Paris stock exchange. During December 1999, GEC's defence arm, Marconi Electronic Systems (MES), was sold to British Aerospace, forming BAE Systems. The rest of GEC, mainly telecommunications equipment manufacturing, continued as Marconi Communications. After buying several US telecoms manufacturers at the top of the market, losses following the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2001 led to the restructuring in 2003 of Marconi plc into Marconi Corporation plc. During 2005, the company failed to secure any part of BT's 21st Century Network (21CN) programme; that same year, Ericsson acquired the bulk of the company; what was left of the business was renamed Telent.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Founding members Pecknold and Skjelset have been the only constants through the group's history, with the former serving as leader and principal songwriter.\nThe band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP Sun Giant and their eponymous debut album on Sub Pop, both of which met with widespread critical acclaim. Their sophomore album Helplessness Blues (2011) earned further praise and became their greatest commercial success to date, reaching number 4 on the Billboard 200. Following a three-year break, Fleet Foxes reconvened in 2016 to record their third album Crack-Up, which was released the following year on Nonesuch Records. This was followed by 2020's Shore, a de facto Pecknold solo album made without the involvement of his bandmates and released through the Anti- label.\nThough the group has experienced limited commercial success, their work has been consistently lauded by music critics, who have praised their lyricism and production style and often noted the band's use of refined instrumentation and vocal harmonies. The band's debut album was ranked by Rolling Stone among the best of the decade and was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The band has been nominated for two Grammy Awards, the first for Best Folk Album in 2012 for Helplessness Blues and the second for Best Alternative Music Album in 2022 for Shore.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He released the song online under the moniker Bomb the Music Industry!, with the use of the word \"bomb\" deriving from a graffiti term, which was meant by Rosenstock to signify a synthesis between creation and destruction. \"I wrote that song and put it out to see if anybody wanted it. That was how it started, people showed interest and I like recording stuff.\" Rosenstock has cited his frustration with the typical practices of the independent music business as the impetus for trying a different, flexible approach, stating that the \"merchandising aspect of things \u2026 was getting in the way of writing songs.\"Due to the response to this first track, Rosenstock launched the first online donation-based record label, Quote Unquote Records in 2006; the label's inaugural release was the first full-length Bomb the Music Industry full-length record, Album Minus Band. Eschewing traditional music merchandising, the band encouraged fans to bring blank T-shirts to shows, which the band would spray paint for using custom stencils, as well as blank CDs, onto which the band would burn copies of their album; Rosenstock and his collaborators provided these services for free, accepting donations when offered. While the band would eventually decide to engage in traditional merchandise sales as well, the free options remained available, maintaining their reputation for DIY ethics.The first three Bomb the Music Industry! records were almost entirely written, performed, and produced by Rosenstock himself, with early shows featuring Rosenstock either performing solo alongside backing tracks on his iPod, or accompanied by a lineup of sporadic guests varying significantly in lineup size. Several tours featured Rosenstock performing as a duo, either with Mustard Plug bassist Rick Johnson, or collaborator Matt Kurz. The Rosenstock/Johnson iteration toured the United Kingdom as part of the Ska is Dead tour.\nIn 2007, following their performance at SKAppleton, Bomb the Music Industry! embarked on the Real Bands Tour?, featuring a full-band lineup, an approach which was reflected in the production of their 2007 record Get Warmer, and followed for subsequent records. While they continued releasing their records digitally for free via Quote Unquote Records, from Get Warmer onward they partnered with Asian Man Records for physical releases. Their first official music video, for the song \"Wednesday Night Drinkball\" from their 2009 record Scrambles, was directed by Bryan Schlam and premiered after the album's release.Following the release of the album Vacation in 2012, the track \"Can\u2019t Complain\" was featured in an episode of The Office. They also recorded a cover of \"Little Boxes\" which was featured in a season eight opening sequence of Weeds. Later that year, the band announced an indefinite hiatus, stating that their summer US tour would likely be their last, stating that \"the 9 \u2013 10 months of our lives when we are not playing music are not fantastic. ... it seems like it\u2019s just time to see if there\u2019s anything out there that can provide us with full-time joy instead of part-time joy.\" Following an international farewell tour in 2013, the band played their final show in Brooklyn on January 19, 2014.

Billboard recognized them as one of the greatest musical trios of all time; they were also ranked as the third most successful girl group of all time on the Billboard charts, behind TLC and The Supremes. The group's single \"Independent Women\" (2000) ranked second on Billboard's list of the \"Top 40 Biggest Girl Group Songs of All Time on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart\". \"Independent Women\" was also acknowledged by the Guinness World Records as the longest-running number-one song on the Hot 100 by a girl group. The term \"Bootylicious\" (a combination of the words booty and delicious) became popularized by Destiny's Child's single of the same and was later added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006. The term was also used to describe Beyonc\u00e9 during the 2000s decade due to her curvaceous figure. VH1 included \"Bootylicious\" on their \"100 Greatest Songs of the '00s\" list in 2011, and Destiny's Child on their \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list the following year. Additionally, \"Independent Women\" was ranked as one of NME's \"100 Best Songs of the 00s\".

Ciara was inspired to pursue a career in music after seeing Destiny's Child perform on television. Ariana Grande cited Destiny's Child as one of her vocal inspirations, saying that listening to the group's music is how she discovered her range and \"learned about harmonies and runs and ad-libs.\" Meghan Trainor stated that her single \"No\" (2016) was inspired by the late 1990s and early 2000s sounds of Destiny's Child, NSYNC, and Britney Spears. Fifth Harmony cited Destiny's Child as their biggest inspiration, and even paid tribute to the group by performing a medley of \"Say My Name\", \"Independent Women\", \"Bootylicious\" and \"Survivor\" on the television show Greatest Hits.

{"id": "740_181", "question": "Where was Wells Fargo founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_17286", "text": "Henry Wells and William G. Fargo, who founded American Express along with John Butterfield, formed Wells Fargo & Company in 1852 to provide \"express\" and banking services to California, which was growing rapidly due to the California Gold Rush. Its earliest and most significant tasks included transporting gold from the Philadelphia Mint and \"express\" mail delivery that was faster and less expensive than U.S. Mail. American Express was not interested in serving California.\n\nBy the end of the California Gold Rush, Wells Fargo was a dominant express and banking organization in the West, making large shipments of gold and delivering mail and supplies. It was also the primary lender of Butterfield Overland Mail Company, which ran a 2,757-mile route through the Southwest to San Francisco and was nicknamed the \"Butterfield Line\" after the name of the company's president, John Butterfield. In 1860,  Congress failed to pass the annual Post Office appropriation bill, leaving the Post Office unable to pay Overland Mail Company. This caused Overland to default on its debts to Wells Fargo, allowing Wells Fargo to take control of the mail route. Wells Fargo then operated the western portion of the Pony Express.Six years later, the \"Grand Consolidation\" united Wells Fargo, Holladay, and Overland Mail stage lines under the Wells Fargo name.\nIn 1872, Lloyd Tevis, a friend of the Central Pacific \"Big Four\" and holder of rights to operate an express service over the Transcontinental Railroad, became president of the company after acquiring a large stake, a position he held until 1892.In 1905, Wells Fargo separated its banking and express operations, and Wells Fargo's bank merged with the Nevada National Bank to form the Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank.During the First World War, the United States government nationalized Wells Fargo's express business into a federal agency known as the US Railway Express Agency (REA). After the war, the REA was privatized and continued service until 1975.\nIn 1923, Wells Fargo Nevada merged with the Union Trust Company to form the Wells Fargo Bank & Union Trust Company.In 1954, Wells Fargo & Union Trust shortened its name to Wells Fargo Bank. Four years later, it merged with American Trust Company to form the Wells Fargo Bank American Trust Company. It changed its name back to Wells Fargo Bank in 1962.\nIn 1968, Wells Fargo was converted to a federal banking charter and became Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In that same year, Wells Fargo merged with Henry Trione's Sonoma Mortgage in a $10.8 million stock transfer, making Trione the largest shareholder in Wells Fargo until Warren Buffett and Walter Annenberg surpassed him.One year later, Wells Fargo & Company holding company was formed, with Wells Fargo Bank as its main subsidiary.In September 1983, a Wells Fargo armored truck depot in West Hartford, Connecticut, was the victim of the White Eagle robbery. The robbery was organized by Los Macheteros (a guerrilla group seeking Puerto Rican independence from the United States) and involved an insider armored truck guard. It was the largest US bank theft to date with $7.1 million stolen.Throughout the 1980s and '90s, Wells Fargo completed a series of acquisitions. In 1986, it acquired Crocker National Bank from Midland Bank. Then, in 1987 it acquired the personal trust business of Bank of America. In 1988, it acquired Barclays Bank of California from Barclays plc. In 1991, Wells Fargo spent $491 million to acquire 130 branches in California from Great American Bank. In 1996, Wells Fargo acquired First Interstate Bancorp for $11.6 billion. Integration went poorly as many executives left.Wells Fargo became the first major US financial services firm to offer internet banking, in May 1995.After its string of acquisitions, in 1998, Wells Fargo Bank was acquired by Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis, with the combined company assuming the Wells Fargo name.It then began on another set of acquisitions, starting in 2000, when Wells Fargo Bank acquired National Bank of Alaska and First Security Corporation. In late 2001, it acquired H.D. Vest Financial Services for $128 million, but sold it in 2015 for $580 million. In 2007, Wells Fargo acquired Greater Bay Bancorp, which had $7.4 billion in assets, in a $1.5 billion transaction. It also acquired Placer Sierra Bank and CIT Group's construction unit that same year. In 2008, Wells Fargo acquired United Bancorporation of Wyoming and Century Bancshares of Texas.On October 3, 2008, after Wachovia turned down an inferior offer from Citigroup, Wachovia agreed to be bought by Wells Fargo for about $14.8 billion in stock. The next day, a New York state judge issued a temporary injunction blocking the transaction from going forward while the competing offer from Citigroup was sorted out. Citigroup alleged that it had an exclusivity agreement with Wachovia that barred Wachovia from negotiating with other potential buyers. The injunction was overturned late in the evening on October 5, 2008, by the New York state appeals court. Citigroup and Wells Fargo then entered into negotiations brokered by the FDIC to reach an amicable solution to the impasse. The negotiations failed. Citigroup was unwilling to take on more risk than the $42 billion that would have been the cap under the previous FDIC-backed deal (with the FDIC incurring all losses over $42 billion). Citigroup did not block the merger, but sought damages of $60 billion for breach of an alleged exclusivity agreement with Wachovia.On October 28, 2008, Wells Fargo received $25 billion of funds via the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act in the form of a preferred stock purchase by the United States Department of the Treasury. As a result of requirements of the government stress tests, the company raised $8.6 billion in capital in May 2009. On December 23, 2009, Wells Fargo redeemed $25 billion of preferred stock issued to the United States Department of the Treasury. As part of the redemption of the preferred stock, Wells Fargo also paid accrued dividends of $131.9 million, bringing the total dividends paid to $1.441 billion since the preferred stock was issued in October 2008.In April 2009, Wells Fargo acquired North Coast Surety Insurance Services.In 2010, hedge fund administrator Citco purchased the trust company operation of Wells Fargo in the Cayman Islands.In 2011, the company hired 25 investment bankers from Citadel LLC.In April 2012, Wells Fargo acquired Merlin Securities.

They operated out of a red clapboard building in Westminster, Massachusetts. They began manufacture of at least three cracker varieties: \"common crackers, the butter cracker,\" and the oyster cracker. During its early days, the factory's machinery was powered by a horse on a treadmill; steam power followed, and by 1922, the bakery was electrified.In 1909, a photograph of the decorated cracker factory was published in the 150th Anniversary Celebration of the Town of Westminster, Massachusetts by Wilbur F. Whitney. The company's owners, C. C. Dawley & Sons, were participants of that year's float, constituting \"5 decorated teams representing the baking business.\" \"Mrs. C. C. Dawley\" was a member of the parade committee.By Christmas of 1912, the factory was \"turning out 100 bbls [barrels] of crackers daily.\"The 1913 Directory of Massachusetts Manufactures lists the Westminster Bakery as owned by C. C. Dawley & Sons.\nCirca 1922, their slogan was \"Westminster Crackers: As good as can be made.\"Westminster Cracker Company was owned by the Dawley family for more than 100 years. Dawley & Shepard, Inc., headed by President David Dawley, sold its breading factory to the Pillsbury Company in 1982.  The rights to make Westminster Crackers were retained by Peter Dawley who started a new Westminster Cracker company in Rutland in 1988. Historically, the most famous cracker was the common cracker that filled Cracker Barrel country stores in New England.

The band was always distinguished by a festive and irreverent musical fusion, celebrating the culture of the nacos and integrating sketches and albures in its lyrics and concerts. Its style, standard rock, was combined with satirical lyrics that portrayed urban life and popular culture in Mexico City.\nIn their song \"Guaca Rock de la Malinche\", they coined the phrase Todo lo naco es chido (Everything tacky is cool), trying to re-vindicate the popular culture of the lower socio-economic classes. Botellita de Jerez pioneered a lot of trends from contemporary art in Mexico and the United States, since it incorporated motifs from popular use, such as lucha libre, popular dances and slang, which are now commonly used among the upper classes as well.\nThe name of the band comes from a Mexican saying used as rebuttal in an argument: \"Botellita de jerez, todo lo que me digas, ser\u00e1 al rev\u00e9s\", which literally means: \"Bottle of sherry, all you say to me will be otherwise\" However, the equivalent English idiom is: \"I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.\"One of their most notable songs is \"Ni\u00f1a de mis ojos\" included in the LP of the same name, which has been released on the albums \"El Ultimo Guacarrock\" and \"Superespecial Un Plug\".\nThe signature songs of Botellita de Jerez are \"Guacarrock\", \"El Guaca Rock de la Malinche\", \"Alarmala de Tos\", \"Oh Denny's\" and \"Abuelita de Batman\" (The Granny of Batman) which became the first cumbia-rock of the rock band, the song is notable for its parody-music video filmed in Colonia Santa Mar\u00eda la Ribera in Mexico City.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Too late in the bands life came the notion that throwing yourself around the stage and making a racket was great in a club but maybe didn't translate to an arena or stadium crowd. We needed to be more ambitious with our shows. It wasn't just about having a laugh. Being a stadium band was an artform.

Until its closure in 2003, it was one of the world's largest steel-producing and shipbuilding companies. At the height of its success and productivity, the company was a symbol of American manufacturing leadership in the world, and its decline and ultimate liquidation in the late 20th century is similarly cited as an example of America's diminished manufacturing leadership. From its founding in 1857 through its 2003 dissolution, Bethlehem Steel's headquarters and primary steel mill manufacturing facilities were based in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of the United States.\nThe company's steel was used in the construction of many of America's largest and most famed structures. Among major buildings, Bethlehem produced steel for 28 Liberty Street, the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Rockefeller Center, and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City and Merchandise Mart in Chicago. Among major bridges, Bethlehem steel was used in constructing the George Washington Bridge and Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in New York City, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, and the Peace Bridge between Buffalo and Fort Erie, Ontario.\nBethlehem Steel played an instrumental role in manufacturing the U.S. warships and other military weapons used in World War I and later by the Allied forces in ultimately winning World War II. Over 1,100 Bethlehem Steel-manufactured warships were built for use in defeating Nazi Germany and the Axis powers in World War II. Historians cite Bethlehem Steel's ability to quickly manufacture warships and other military equipment as decisive factors in American victories in both world wars.Bethlehem Steel's roots trace to an iron-making company organized in 1857 in Bethlehem, which was later named the Bethlehem Iron Company. In 1899, the owners of the iron company founded Bethlehem Steel Company and, five years later, Bethlehem Steel Corporation was created to be the steelmaking company's corporate parent.\nBethlehem Steel survived the earliest declines in the American steel industry beginning in the 1970s. In 1982, however, the company suspended most of its steelmaking operations after posting a loss of $1.5 billion, attributable to increased foreign competition, rising labor and pensions costs, and other factors. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and final dissolution in 2003 when its remaining assets were sold to International Steel Group.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. At the time they barely knew the rudiments of instrumentation, and actually getting a band off the ground seemed unrealistic. Eventually, Hasula learned how to play a box guitar, later moving on to an electric guitar. In the meantime, schoolmate Dasith Fernando got a drum set and soon they were jamming, with Javeen on vocals. Another schoolmate, Soorya Hasthimuni, joined the band, and the four of them started to cover songs by their favourite bands. Soorya was on lead guitar and Hasula on rhythm guitar. Since they were lacking a bassist, they got another friend to help them on the bass guitar.At the beginning of 2004 the band decided take things more seriously and chose the name \"Tantrum\". They started off practising in cheap studios, since access to cash and good equipment was hard to come-by. The band put together a demo for TNL Onstage, although they were still short of a consistent bassist. Javeen took up bass guitar duties, but found it hard to play and sing at the same time. The band then got a new vocalist, who was also a schoolmate, who agreed to fill in until the band could identify a permanent vox. In the end, the band did not make it in to TNL Onstage 2004 due to the poor quality of the recording submitted as a demo as the band could not afford to record the track in a professional studio.This disappointing incident motivated the members to improve. Soon after, drummer Dasith left the band and other schoolmates filled in on various instruments for a short period, with Sujiv Fonseka and James Mather staying on as permanent drummer and lead guitarist respectively at the end of 2004. With these talented new members admitted to the Tantrum line-up, in the first few months of 2005 Tantrum had a stable line-up and decided to work on developing the original songs the band had composed over the past year. For once, they did not have to depend on many outside practice studio facilities as they practised at the drummer's home.Tantrum recorded and released their first single titled \"The Destroyer\", which instantly made waves in the local music scene with its unique theme, creative riffs and catchy drumming. It reached the number one spot on local TNL Radio's SL Hot 10, which it held for several weeks, and was the first debut track of any local band to reach the Number 1 spot on this much listened to chart-show that highlighted the best of local talent each week.\nThis earned Tantrum some recognition in the music scene. They joined the now defunct Rock Company, which was then the main organisation promoting rock and metal bands in Sri Lanka. Soon afterwards, Tantrum released their second single, titled \"Alone,\"  which although wholly different from The Destroyer in terms of mood and composition, also became a chart topping hit within a few weeks of its debut, and a new favourite among the local rock fans. Tantrum entered TNL Onstage 2005, and won the trophy for the Best Band. This was a good achievement as the band had been unable to even qualify for the competition the previous year. After Onstage and the release of the track \"Alone,\" drummer Sujiv left the band as he was leaving the country. He was replaced by former Hi-Octane drummer Heshan Jayawardena. Soon after Tantrum's first Rock Saturday event, which was also in 2005, Hasula left the band as he was leaving the country. The band that had a unique presence with three guitarists was now down to two, and has remained a four-member line-up ever since.The band also later saw the exit of guitarists Soorya and James who both left the country and were replaced by Malinda Senanayake and Arjun Dhas.

The company started in a garage in Palo Alto during a fellowship they had with past professor Frederick Terman at Stanford during the Great Depression, whom they considered a mentor in forming the company. In 1938, Packard and Hewlett began part-time work in a rented garage with an initial capital investment of US$538 (equivalent to $11,645 in 2023). In 1939, Hewlett and Packard decided to formalize their partnership. They tossed a coin to decide whether the company they founded would be called Hewlett-Packard (HP) or Packard-Hewlett.Hewlett and Packard's first financially successful product was a precision audio oscillator known as the HP 200A, which used a small incandescent light bulb (known as a \"pilot light\") as a temperature dependent resistor in a critical portion of the circuit, and a negative feedback loop to stabilize the amplitude of the output sinusoidal waveform. This allowed the HP 200A to be sold for $89.40 when competitors were selling less stable oscillators for over $200. The 200 series of generators continued production until at least 1972 as the 200AB, still tube-based but improved in design through the years.One of the company's earliest customers was Bud Hawkins, chief sound engineer for Walt Disney Studios, who bought eight HP 200B audio oscillators (at $71.50 each) to be used in the animated film Fantasia. HP's profit at the end of 1939, its first full year of business, was $1,563 (equivalent to $34,236 in 2023) on revenues of $5,369.In 1942, they built their first building at 395 Page Mill Road and were awarded the Army-Navy \"E\" Award in 1943.

In 1795, the trustees formed the Upper Appomattox Company to build dams along the river for industrial use, beginning Dominion's history. In 1901, the water rights passed to the newly formed Virginia Passenger & Power Company.Dominion's closest direct corporate ancestor, Virginia Railway & Power Company, was founded by Frank Jay Gould on June 29, 1909. It bought Virginia Passenger & Power soon afterward. In 1925, the name was changed to the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO), a regulated monopoly. In 1940, VEPCO doubled its service territory by merging with the Virginia Public Service Company. The transit operations were sold in 1944. In 1980, VEPCO began branding itself as \"Virginia Power,\" while branding its North Carolina operations as \"North Carolina Power.\" Three years later, VEPCO reorganized as a holding company, Dominion Resources.By 1985, Dominion split its distribution operations among two operating companies: Virginia Power (operating in Virginia and the Greenbrier Valley of West Virginia) and North Carolina Power (operating in North Carolina). In 1986, Dominion gained territory by expanding in Northern Virginia after purchasing the Virginia distribution territory of Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO). In 1987, the West Virginia assets of Dominion were sold to Utilicorp United becoming branded as West Virginia Power, but Dominion retained ownership of the Mount Storm Power Station in West Virginia. (In 1999, West Virginia Power would be sold to Allegheny Energy and folded into its Monongahela Power subsidiary; it and other Allegheny Energy subsidiaries have since been acquired in 2010 by FirstEnergy.)\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Dominion initiated a series of expansions into regulated and non-regulated energy businesses, both domestically and internationally. During that era, the company also established itself as a world-class operator of nuclear power stations.In 2000, Dominion bought Consolidated Natural Gas Company (CNG) of Pittsburgh, and added natural gas service to its energy delivery network in the energy-intensive markets in the Northeastern quadrant of the U.S. In 2001, Dominion bought Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Company, adding to its natural gas delivery network.Dominion re-branded all of its operations in 2000 to Dominion from Virginia and North Carolina Power as well as Consolidated Gas in order to create a more unified energy company. In 2007, as part of another effort to refocus on core electric and gas operations, Dominion sold most of its Houston-based natural gas and oil exploration and production business for pre-tax proceeds of nearly $14 billion. Its onshore US oil and gas reserves were sold in separate deals to Loews Corporation and to XTO Energy, while its Gulf of Mexico reserves were sold to Eni, and its Canadian reserves were sold to two Canadian trusts. Dominion still retains some production areas in Appalachia, however.In February 2016, Dominion Resources announced that it would be acquiring Questar Corporation.

It was conceived by vocalist Chris Cornell of Soundgarden as a tribute to his friend, the late Andrew Wood, lead singer of the bands Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone. The lineup included Stone Gossard on rhythm guitar, Jeff Ament on bass guitar (both ex-members of Mother Love Bone and future members of Pearl Jam), Mike McCready (later Pearl Jam) on lead guitar, and Matt Cameron (Soundgarden and later Pearl Jam) on drums. Eddie Vedder appeared as a guest to provide some lead and backing vocals and later became lead vocalist of Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam's debut album, Ten, was released four months after Temple of the Dog's only studio album.\nThe band released its only album, the self-titled Temple of the Dog, in April 1991 through A&M Records. The recording sessions took place in November and December 1990 at London Bridge Studio in Seattle, Washington, with producer Rakesh \"Rick\" Parashar. Although earning praise from music critics at the time of its release, the album was not widely recognized until 1992, when Vedder, Ament, Gossard, and McCready had their breakthrough with Pearl Jam (causing Temple of the Dog to sometimes be (retroactively) considered a supergroup). Cameron would later join Pearl Jam, serving as drummer since 1998, following Soundgarden's initial break-up in 1997, making the five members of Pearl Jam after that point identical to the members of Temple of the Dog other than Chris Cornell.\nThe band reformed and toured in 2016 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their self-titled album.

{"id": "740_310", "question": "Where was Zatarain's founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_17655", "text": "Zatarain's was founded by Emile A. Zatarain, Sr. a merchant and entrepreneur of Basque descent. He had 5 sons, all of whom followed him into his business when they finished school.In 1886, Zatarain opened a grocery store with the first National Cash Register in Louisiana. A few months later, he bought a horse and buggy to do deliveries.  The company's big success, at first, was root beer. According to great-great granddaughter Allison Zatarain, \"Emile introduced Papoose Root Beer at 2:30 p.m. on May 7, 1889, at the Louisiana (Purchase) Exposition. The root beer was so successful, that his business grew, and grew, and grew!\"Several years later, Zatarain found that it was more cost effective to sell the root beer blend as an extract. Zatarain formed a company called Papoose Pure Food Products to manufacture the root beer and diversify into other foods and he built a factory at 925 Valmont Street, New Orleans.  He began to import and pack olives, pickles and spices.When the root beer and spice business became more profitable than the grocery store, Zatarain focused on the manufacturing business at Papoose Pure Food Products. His root beer extract sold in barrels to restaurants and markets where it was added to carbonated water.\nSeasonings with a Creole or Cajun flair were among the first of Papoose Pure's products expansions. Next they moved into Creole Mustard and pickled products.On May 29, 1922, as his sons assumed more of the day-to-day operation, Zatarain reincorporated the business as E.A. Zatarain & Sons, Inc. and also did business as Zatarain's Pure Food Products. Emile A. Zatarain, Jr. and his wife Ida May Bennett Zatarain eventually took over the business. Ida May created recipes for their products, like Remoulade Sauce and Olive Salad.In 1963 the family sold the business to James Grinstead Viavant, founder of the Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans, who had sold his ship building business in 1959. Viavant took over the company, which was using outdated packaging technology, and modernized it.\nIn 1963, Viavant merged Zatarain's Papoose Products Co., Inc. and another recently-acquired business, Pelican State Lab, owner of a brand of coated fish frying seasoning mix called Fish-Fri, which was brought under the Zatarain's label, and became a best-seller. He dropped bleach, dyes, and pickles and focused on the profit centers at a new plant with modern equipment on a five-acre campus in Gretna, Louisiana, where he turned Zatarain's into a regionally well-known brand by the early 1970s. Fish-Fri became \"the entre\u00e8\" of litigation in 1983. Zatarain's sued Oak Grove Smokehouse for trademark infringement; Oak Grove sold a competitor \"Fish Fry.\" Although the court determined Fish-Fri qualified for protection, Oak Grove's Fish Fry qualified as a fair use. The case opinion is also notable for its use of puns.With sales now at $10M a year, as Viavant neared retirement, he sold the business to Centra Soya Co. for $24 million in May 1984. Centra increased sales revenues to $14M when it sold Zatarain's to a San Francisco holding company, Wyndham Foods, Inc., 18 months later. Wyndham kept the retail business and expanded the brand into the institutional food business. They rolled out the boxed food products that Zatarains still manufactures, using the term \"Cajun\" on the boxes to capitalize on the trend in cooking popularized by New Orleans chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s. When the fad faded, the company shifted to branding Zatarain's products as \"Louisiana-style\" or \"New Orleans-style\".The company was acquired again in 1987 by a Brentwood, Tennessee company, Martha White Foods, itself a subsidiary of E-II Food Specialties Co., for $35 million. Zatarain's had several more owners over a period of months in the late 1980s, including American Brands of Old Greenwich, Connecticut.\nBy the 1990s, Zatarain's marketed more than 200 products locally and regionally.  It pushed for a national footing with the first national television advertising in 1999.\nThe company was taken private in a leveraged buyout by Citigroup Venture Capital in 1993 as Zatarain's Partnership LP, a partner group of Citigroup Venture Capital and several Zatarain's employees. The product line was expanded to include frozen foods.  It was sold to McCormick on May 9, 1993 for $180M after the company's sales rose 15% annually for the prior five years.In 2017, the New Orleans Pelicans announced Zatarain's as their jersey patch sponsor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Those who were present have told me that they did not think that a horse could come down that cliff, but down that dangerous place this young lady rode at speed; there were lives to be saved, and, with the same fearless and chivalrous bravery that urged Grace Darling to peril her life for fellow creations, and gave her a name in all English history thereafter, Grace Bussell rode down that cliff, urged her horse into boiling surf, and out beyond the second line of roaring breakers, till she reached the boat where the women and children were in such peril. Her horse stumbled over the rope and she was nearly lost, but managed to get alongside the boat, and then with as many women and children clinging to her and the horse as possible, she made for the shore and landed them. A man was left on the boat, and he could not get to shore till Miss Bussell sent her black servant on horseback to aid him. So furious was the surf that it took four hours to land 50 people, and every boat engaged was capsized.According to an account by Isaacs' friend, as recounted by the friend's grandson:\n\n\"She went into the water only once. She rode her horse into the water and Sam had to tell her to be careful; that if she rode her horse in the way she was going, she would kill people or trample them under and drown them. He told her to turn her horse around and swim back. There was a woman and a child who grabbed the horse's tail and the horse towed them ashore. But Sam went in and out several times. By the time he got back with Grace, one man had got ashore and he'd got a rope lifeline from the ships mast and fastened it to the shore and soon there were three or four men ashore. It was a great feat for a girl of 16 but she was later given credit for almost the entire rescue.\"She married Frederick Slade Drake-Brockman (1857\u20131917) in 1880; he served as Surveyor General of Western Australia from 1915 to 1917.

The Gate of Memory, a drawing Rossetti made c. 1854, shows a scene from Rosabell where a prostitute is beginning her evening of work, and views a group of innocent girls \"still at play\" dancing. The drawing may have been intended to illustrate the poem in a book, but was painted as a larger watercolour in 1857, which was repainted in 1864. In 1870 Rossetti published a sympathetic poem about a prostitute, Jenny.\n\nThe artist Alexander Munro's maid Ellen Frazer may have posed for an early head-study for the fallen country girl of Found, and an ink-and-wash study of the composition (now in the British Museum) is dated 1853. Rossetti began work on the painting in the autumn of 1854; this is probably the unfinished version now in Carlisle.On 30 September 1853 Rossetti wrote to his mother and sister describing the type of wall, cart and calf that he wished for them to find as models so that he could begin the painting. The unfinished Carlisle version consists only of these three elements, plus the head of Fanny Cornforth, apparently added later. Ford Madox Brown noted in his diary Rossetti's difficulties in painting the calf in November 1854, \"he paints it in all like Albert Durer (sic) hair by hair & seems incapable of any breadth ... From want of habit I see nature bothers him\u2014but it is sweetly drawn & felt.\"The calf's role in the painting is two-fold. First, it explains why the farmer has come to the city. But more importantly, its situation as \"an innocent animal trapped and on its way to be sold\" parallels the woman's and raises questions on the woman's state of mind. \"Is the prostitute rejecting salvation or is she accepting it; or is she repentant but unable to escape her fate, like the calf?\"In 1855, Rossetti described his work-in-progress in a letter to William Holman Hunt:\n\nI can tell you, on my own side, of only one picture fairly begun\u2014indeed, I may say, all things considered, rather advanced; but it is only a small one. The subject had been sometime designed before you left England and will be thought, by any one who sees it when (and if) finished, to follow in the wake of your \"Awakened Conscience,\" but not by yourself, as you know I had long had in view subjects taking the same direction as my present one. The picture represents a London street at dawn, with the lamps still lighted along a bridge which forms the distant background. A drover has left his cart standing in the middle of the road (in which, i. e. the cart, stands baa-ing a calf tied on its way to market), and has run a little way after a girl who has passed him, wandering in the streets. He has just come up with her and she, recognising him, has sunk under her shame upon her knees, against the wall of a raised churchyard in the foreground, while he stands holding her hands as he seized them, half in bewilderment and half guarding her from doing herself a hurt. These are the chief things in the picture which is to be called \"Found,\" and for which my sister Maria has found me a most lovely motto from Jeremiah ... The calf, a white one, will be a beautiful and suggestive part of the thing, though I am far from having painted him as well as I hoped to do.\nThe motto from Jeremiah 2:2 reads \"I remember Thee; the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy betrothal.\"  and appears on two early compositional studies. Rossetti replaced the word \"espousal\" in the motto as he found it with \"betrothal\", which he felt better translated the sense of the original Hebrew.In 1858, Rossetti met Fanny Cornforth, who soon became his mistress. She later described how he invited her to his studio and \"put my head against the wall and drew it for the head of the calf picture\". He made several pen and ink drawings about this time of the heads of both the male and female subjects.\nA version in oils was commissioned in 1859 by James Leathart, and this version, with the face of Fanny Cornforth, is the painting now in the Delaware Art Museum. Rossetti struggled with Found, abandoning and returning to it intermittently until at least 1881, and leaving it unfinished at his death. His assistants Henry Treffry Dunn and Frederic Shields both helped with the painting, and Dunn and Edward Burne-Jones may have worked on it after Rossetti's death.Rossetti published a poem, also titled \"Found\", as a companion to the painting in 1881 in the volume Ballads and Sonnets.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Void represented the first songwriting effort featuring the band as a whole, as Dunable had written much of the material for Null prior to the other members joining the band.In August 2007, guitarist/vocalist Leon del Muerte left the band to focus on Murder Construct and was replaced by Dave Timnick.  Shortly thereafter Intronaut toured Europe for the first time in support of The Ocean.\nIn January 2008, the band announced that they had signed a worldwide deal with Century Media Records and completed their next album, Prehistoricisms.  As the album was the first without del Muerte - whom the band described as their \"metal riff guy\" - Prehistoricisms took on a more rhythmic quality that was exemplified by the double-drummer ending of \"Any Port\".  They also recorded a cover of Eyehategod's \"Dixie Whiskey\" for Century Media's twentieth anniversary covers album.\nIn April 2009, Intronaut toured with Kylesa and Mastodon.  Later that year, in October 2009, Intronaut played several shows in Kolkata and Pragati Maidan, Delhi for the Great Indian Rock Festival XIII.\nIn the summer of 2010, Intronaut released their third full-length album, Valley of Smoke, featuring a guest appearance from Justin Chancellor from Tool.  The album was characterized by increased use of melody and pitched singing, as well as more concise songs. In late 2010, Intronaut opened for Cynic on the \"Re-Traced/Re-Focused Tour\" of North America.  Shortly thereafter, Intronaut completed another North American tour opening for Helmet.\nIn mid-2011, Intronaut toured Europe with The Ocean and Red Fang, then toured North America with Animals as Leaders, Dead Letter Circus, and Last Chance to Reason, and then toured Europe again with Ghost Brigade and A Storm of Light.\nIn early 2012, Intronaut supported Tool on the first leg of their North American tour. After the tour, they commenced writing for their fourth studio album, Habitual Levitations (Instilling Words with Tones), which was released on March 19, 2013. In April 2014 they supported TesseracT in their North American tour, as well as serving as the live backing band for one man progressive outfit Cloudkicker's live debut.In 2015, the band released their fifth album, \"The Direction of Last Things\".\nIn 2018, Intronaut fired their drummer, Danny Walker, following allegations of domestic abuse.In 2020, after 5 years without new music, the band entered  the studio with Alex R\u00fcdinger performing as a session drummer to fill the vacant spot left by Danny.

{"id": "740_373", "question": "Where was Routledge founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_17816", "text": "The firm originated in 1836, when the London bookseller George Routledge published an unsuccessful guidebook, The Beauties of Gilsland, with his brother-in-law W. H. (William Henry) Warne as assistant. In 1848, the pair entered the booming market for selling inexpensive imprints of works of fiction to rail travellers, in the style of the German Tauchnitz family, which became known as the \"Railway Library\".The venture was a success as railway usage grew, and it eventually led to Routledge, along with W H Warne's brother Frederick Warne, to found the company, George Routledge & Co. in 1851.\nThe following year in 1852, the company gained lucrative business through selling reprints of Uncle Tom's Cabin, (in the public domain in the UK) which in turn enabled it to pay author Edward Bulwer-Lytton \u00a320,000 for a 10-year lease allowing sole rights to print all 35 of his works including 19 of his novels to be sold cheaply as part of their \"Railway Library\" series.\nThe company was restyled in 1858 as Routledge, Warne & Routledge when George Routledge's son, Robert Warne Routledge, entered the partnership. Frederick Warne eventually left the company after the death of his brother W. H. Warne in May 1859 (died aged 37). Gaining rights to some titles, he founded Frederick Warne & Co. in 1865, which became known for its Beatrix Potter books. In July 1865, George Routledge's son Edmund Routledge became a partner, and the firm became George Routledge & Sons.By 1899, the company was running close to bankruptcy. Following a successful restructuring in 1902 by scientist Sir William Crookes, banker Arthur Ellis Franklin, William Swan Sonnenschein as managing director, and others, however, it was able to recover and began to acquire and merge with other publishing companies including J. C. Nimmo Ltd. in 1903. In 1912, the company took over the management of Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner & Co., the descendant of companies founded by Charles Kegan Paul, Alexander Chenevix Trench, Nicholas Tr\u00fcbner, and George Redway.These early 20th-century acquisitions brought with them lists of notable scholarly titles, and from 1912 onward,  the company became increasingly concentrated in the academic and scholarly publishing business under the imprint \"Kegan Paul Trench Trubner\", as well as reference, fiction and mysticism. In 1947, George Routledge and Sons finally merged with Kegan Paul Trench Trubner (the umlaut had been quietly dropped in the First World War) under the name of Routledge & Kegan Paul. Using C. K. Ogden and later Karl Mannheim as advisers the company was soon particularly known for its titles in philosophy, psychology and the social sciences.\nIn 1985, Routledge & Kegan Paul joined with Associated Book Publishers (ABP), which was later acquired by International Thomson in 1987. Under Thomson's ownership, Routledge's name and operations were retained, with the additions of backlists from Methuen, Tavistock Publications, Croom Helm and Unwin Hyman. In 1996, a management buyout financed by the European private equity firm Cinven saw Routledge operating as an independent company once again. In 1997, Cinven acquired journals publisher Carfax and book publisher Spon. In 1998, Cinven and Routledge's directors accepted a deal for Routledge's acquisition by Taylor & Francis Group (T&F), with the Routledge name being retained as an imprint and subdivision.In 2004, T&F became a division within Informa plc after a merger. Routledge continues as a primary publishing unit and imprint within Informa's 'academic publishing' division, publishing academic humanities and social science books, journals, reference works and digital products. Routledge has grown considerably as a result of organic growth and acquisitions of other publishing companies and other publishers' titles by its parent company. Humanities and social sciences titles acquired by T&F from other publishers are rebranded under the Routledge imprint.Routledge  is a signatory of the SDG Publishers Compact, and has taken steps to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The stage is also decorated to match the theme of the evening; sound designs, scenery, costumes are always integral to the show. SEVI's first such concept, the so-called Pirate Show, was developed in order to enhance the audience's experience for the promotional release of What Lies Beyond, the band's debut. Apart from the stylized costumes, the band members had tucked daggers and pistols into their britches, laid down chains, hanged cobwebs, and scattered skulls around the stage, with the beginning of the show being signaled by cannon fire, courtesy of their own, non-deadly but quite LOUD prop cannon. This theme was taken on the road for the \u201cWhat Lies Beyond Tour 2012\u201d.\nA month after the first Pirate Show performance, SEVI returns to the local stage with their second stage design \u201cRoute 66.\u201d The stage being made to look like a small gas station on a US highway going nowhere, the musicians themselves were in full character; dusty and road-weary, looking for a place to lay down their hats and strike a chord or two.\nFollowing this order, SEVI comes up with the idea to rearrange their songs into a multi-genre acoustic performance. Coupled with the video presentation of the song \u201cThe Victim\", SEVI set an intimate stage/scene inviting folks to hear and enjoy the band's softer side. The stage is decorated like a cozy and familiar room, hats and umbrellas hanging on hooks, candles shining a soft light on Svetlana's silhouette, and a chandelier similar to the one used on the video for \"Victim.\"\nOne of SEVI's most notable shows \u2013 \"Last Call for 2013\" \u2013 finds Svetlana in a Steampunk top hat with goggles, leather gloves and chains, with a large metal plate fashioned into the band's logo which adorns her microphone stand. This metal logo remains a constant feature till this day. Guitarist Bobby Zasheff is equally dashing with a leather vest with a pocket watch on a chain peeking out from its pocket.\nWhen it came time to present \u201cOn My Own\", one of the first songs to be featured on SEVI's second release \u2013 The Battle Never Ends, the stage is decorated to resemble a train station, with the musicians acting out bits and scenes from the music video to the delight of fans.

{"id": "740_387", "question": "Where was Positronic founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_17851", "text": "Positronic was founded by Jack Gentry, a former marines officer and a metallurgical engineer. Upon being discharged from the military, Gentry worked for Honeywell as a sales engineer.On a flight from Los Angeles to New York City, Gentry met business manager and philanthropist Harry Gray. Four months later, Gray called Gentry and offered him a job with Litton Industries. During his stay at Litton Industries, Gentry established a plant of the company in Springfield, Missouri. However, feeling that he needed to explore other opportunities, he decided to create his own small company. By October 1966, he had founded Positronic Industries in Springfield, Missouri and initially, the company manufactured electronic components and connectors for the aerospace industry.Eight years later, Positronic moved to Rogersville, Missouri, and in the following years, it progressed and managed three expansions. Tragically, the company's growth was shaken in February 1983, when a fire destroyed its new headquarters and manufacturing plant. Fearing that the company's competitors would take advantage of the situation, Gentry and his employees worked tirelessly to rebuild Positronic. They moved the company back to Springfield, Missouri, where Positronic's headquarters is still located today. And as the company gradually recovered from its losses, Positronic decided to venture overseas. Just months after the fire, the company expanded its operations into Europe. This expansion continued into Puerto Rico in 1991, Singapore in 1995, and India in 2004.Beginning in 1993, Positronic began offering on-the-job training as a part of its apprenticeship program. The program is geared toward high school students seeking jobs in high-tech manufacturing, and it is offered to 17 and 18-year-olds as a school-to-work career opportunity. After graduation, successful apprentices are offered both employment with Positronic and funding for their college education for two years. Positronic also used the Ozarks Technical Community College training program for its own employee co-operative program.In March 1995, employees of the main plant in Springfield were sent home after a chemical accident released a chlorine odor throughout the facility. A treatment plant operator caused the accident by improperly mixing chemicals in a waste treatment holding tank, creating pockets of chlorine gas. No one was harmed in the incident.Despite the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, Positronic opened its 43,000 ft2 assembly plant in Mount Vernon, Missouri in 1999. Although the company had established a presence in Mount Vernon years before on July 5, 1988, the opening of the new facility was a part of Positronic's expansion into the Mount Vernon area. The facility houses the company's plastic molding department.In 2002, less than a year after the September 11 attacks, then-US Senatorial candidate Jim Talent of Missouri visited Springfield. Talent put forward the message that the US government had to increase its military spending, especially in regard to building a strong missile defense system. On his tour of Positronic's facility on North Eldon Avenue, Talent stated that increasing the government's defense spending would produce more jobs for the American people. Positronic, a creator of domestic manufacturing jobs, produces electronic products that are being used in satellites, missiles, and other military equipment.In 2011, Positronic moved eighty-one jobs from the two Springfield manufacturing plants to its Mount Vernon manufacturing plant. The shift was made in order to double the workforce of the Mount Vernon plant and to consolidate the company's two electrical connector assembly lines. With the increase in workforce, the company became one of the largest private employers in Mount Vernon.In the same year, the company provided two $15,000 gift funds to Ozarks Technical Community College.

{"id": "740_397", "question": "Where was The Slip founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_17880", "text": "The band was formed at Tabor Academy in Marion, Massachusetts, in 1989 as a student rock band that toured New England high school campuses. The founding members (guitarist Howard Gould, husband of Court TV anchor Ashleigh Banfield, drummer Mike Johnson, lead guitarist Johnny Myers, bassist Cain Goettleman, and singer Jack Lewin) left the band upon graduating in 1990 and 1991, leaving it in the hands of the three current members. In the early days the band saw members come and go including singer Sally Taylor, the daughter of Carly Simon and James Taylor. All three current members were students and eventual graduates of Tabor Academy.  After attending the Berklee School of Music in Boston for a short time, the trio collectively dropped out in 1996 to push their debut self-released album, From the Gecko.\nFollowing consistent touring, mostly in the Northeast but eventually in the West as well, the band was signed to Butch Trucks's label Flying Frog Records, where they put out Does in 2000. Subsequent years saw continued touring, including their first trip to Japan, and the release of the band's first live album, Live Is My Jumby. The Slip then signed to Rykodisc, releasing Angels Come on Time in 2002.\nIn 2003, the companion live albums Alivelectric and Aliveacoustic were released on the band's own label, 216 Records. The former was a mostly instrumental exploration into experimental noise collages, reminiscent at times of post-rock bands such as Do Make Say Think and Tortoise, or electronic acts like Squarepusher. The latter consisted of Americana-tinged folk songs with an emphasis on lyrics, though some songs such as \"Torque\" and \"Song\" were more reminiscent of earlier, jazz-influenced Slip work.\nStarting in 2004, the band began to focus less energy on touring as The Slip and more on the Surprise Me Mr. Davis side project and the new Slip studio album. In 2005, the song \"Even Rats\", an early cut from the newest studio sessions, was featured on the PlayStation 2 video game Guitar Hero. The song was also released as a single available only online in 2006. Justin Vernon, of Bon Iver, was influenced by the group.During 2005 and 2006, The Slip gained greater recognition after appearances at festivals such as Bonnaroo, SXSW, Bumbershoot, and High Sierra Music Festival. After a long period of record label shopping, \"Even Rats\" and other songs finally saw release on the album Eisenhower, released in November 2006 on Bar/None Records. Eisenhower saw an evolution in their sound, incorporating indie rock influences from bands like Built to Spill and The Flaming Lips. The Slip supported the album by touring throughout the United States and Canada, including a run of dates opening for the indie rock band My Morning Jacket in November and December 2006. The album also placed an emphasis on songwriting over improvisation. On February 5, 2007, the Slip made their national television debut on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, playing \"Children of December\". The following June, they performed at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee for the second time. \nStarting in late 2007, the trio took an unannounced hiatus from regular touring and have since only played occasional gigs as The Slip. The members have been pursuing musical endeavors outside of the band. In 2008 The Slip supported Sonya Kitchell in a tour for her album This Storm. The album is a collaboration between Kitchell, Brad Barr, Andrew Barr, and Malcolm Burn.Brad, Andrew and Marc have continued to play with Nathan Moore and Marco Benevento in the band Surprise Me Mr. Davis. After moving to Montreal in 2005, Brad and Andrew pursued solo projects culminating in The Barr Brothers, also featuring Sarah Page on Harp and multi-instrumentalist Andres Vial. Marc Friedman has performed as a member of Marco Benevento's trio as well as collaborating with San Francisco-based Big Light, producing their upcoming album and subbing for bassist Steve Adams for many gigs.In 2009, The Slip played a short East Coast Summer tour and returned to High Sierra Music Festival in Quincy, California, on July 4 and 5. 2010 saw only a handful of shows in New York, Austin & San Francisco as well as their 13th consecutive year at High Sierra Music Festival, a higher total than any other band in the history of the festival. February 2011 brought the return of The Slip to Japan as well as dates at the Brooklyn Bowl in Williamsburg, New York on July 14, 2011 and The Met in Pawtucket, RI on July 16, 2011. 2012 was rung in with two shows at San Francisco's Cafe Du Nord on December 30 & 31, 2011.The future of The Slip seems to be on hold as the founding members, Brad and Andrew, had been focusing their work into The Barr Brothers as of late. The Slip has reportedly been working on recording a follow-up album to Eisenhower since 2009 and have introduced several new songs as cuts from the supposed album in their latest live performances. Bassist Marc Friedman still resides in California, supposedly working on new material as he explores various musical endeavours. 2013 marked the first in 15 years the group had been absent from the lineup of High Sierra Music Festival. They were absent from the festival lineup in 2014 as well, still focusing more energy into other musical endeavours. In early 2015, The Slip announced a return to the festival for the 2015 lineup. This would be the band's first performance since 2011.\nIn 2021 the band reunited for three sets at LOCKN' Farm as part of Joe Russo's Almost Dead's curated festival in mid-August. Soon after, The Slip announced their first proper tour since 2009. The seven-show-run included stops in Burlington, Providence, Boston, Philly, Brooklyn, and finished up at Levon Helm's barn in Woodstock, New York. The shows saw the trio revisit early material, re-work fan favourites, and debut new songs. On several occasions throughout the tour, lead singer and guitarist Brad Barr acknowledged the band's shape-shifting musical identity, their need for an extended hiatus, and their overall optimism for the future of The Slip.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Tilton, who lived a few doors down the road from Robb, bought a 'Woolworth's special' guitar from a junk shop, while Robb built his own bass guitar out of spare parts and a slab of wood from a local DIY store (along with dustbin lids, the band having no drummer at this stage). They then enlisted a singer Martyn Critchley and Martin Kelly joined on drums. Critchley subsequently left, with Robb and Tilton taking over to share the vocals, Martin Kelly moving to keyboards with a Wasp synthesiser and a 13-year-old called \"Coofy Sid\" (Coulthart) joining on drums.

James claims that the formation of Hacktivist was a \"fluke\", with no intention of developing such a style, but the group was born when peer J Hurley, a local rapper with little history in the metal scene, began recording vocals over some of James' demos. After the demos became very popular online, James decided to recruit a full lineup, bringing in Richard Hawking on drums, Josh Gurner (ex-Sacred Mother Tongue) on bass and Ben Marvin (James's former bandmate in Heart of a Coward) as a second vocalist. In 2012, the band put out a self-titled EP resulting in debut single \"Unlike Us\" reaching No. 2 on the Amazon UK metal chart within 48 hours. Despite being released independently on 12 November 2012, the band's self-titled EP proved popular in the metal media with Metal Hammer in particular giving the band significant coverage and considerable airplay on BBC Radio 1.\nAfter the release of the Hacktivist EP, the band set out to tour. This included supporting slots for acts such as Enter Shikari and Korn and performances in European festivals such as Sonisphere Festival, Download Festival and Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in summer 2013. In April 2013 the group released a new song \"Elevate\", with an accompanying video, for free download and was followed up in August with a cover of \"Niggas In Paris\" (originally by Jay-Z and Kanye West). A video for their cover of \"Niggas In Paris\" was filmed during their set at Download Festival 2013. They also performed a live session for BBC Radio 1 at Maida Vale Studios.\nThe band headed out on a UK headline tour throughout winter 2013, supported by The Algorithm. A re-release of their debut EP with four bonus tracks was released on 11 November 2013.\nThe band has shown support for hacktivism collective Anonymous, and appear to support \"whistle-blowers\" Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning whom they reference in the song 'Cold Shoulders'.\nOn 4 August 2014, Hacktivist released the single and video for \"False Idols\". Many references to activism (especially hacktivist collective Anonymous) are made throughout the video and within hours the song had reached number 1 on the iTunes Metal chart. This release was followed on 12 November by \"Deceive and Defy\" (also accompanied by a video), featuring Charlie Holmes of Heart in Hand on vocals. Hacktivist then toured the UK from November to December, supported by Dead Harts and the One Hundred.\nFollowing the release of the single \"Buszy\" on 17 January 2016, their debut studio album Outside the Box was released on 4 March 2016.On the 20 January 2017, it was announced that Hacktivist and Ben Marvin were parting ways due to Ben's family commitments, and rapper/vocalist Jot Maxi was brought in as the new co-vocalist. In May, the band released '2 Rotten', a heavier remix of 'Rotten' from Outside the Box, with Jot Maxi taking more of a leading role than he had in the original.\nOn the 28th of March 2018, it was announced that Hacktivist and Timfy James had parted ways. Following on from this, the band recruited James Hewitt (of bands 'Invocation' and 'Exist Immortal') as their new guitarist and producer with an official announcement made on the 19 January 2019. Hewitt had been playing live and writing new material with the band since June 2018. As a result, Josh Gurner would provide clean vocals following Timfy James' departure.\nThe band embarked on a headline UK tour in Jan/Feb 2019 and went on to release the single 'Reprogram' with accompanying video on the 10th of April 2019. In 2021, the band released a song titled \"Planet Zero\" with an accompanying music video from their upcoming album Hyperdialect.\nOn June 27, 2023, the band announced that co-lead vocalist Jot Maxi would be stepping down from his role in the band. Two days later on June 29, the band announced that former Borders vocalist Jordan 'JJ' Olifent would be joining the band as the new co-lead vocalist, alongside a new single titled 'Rep the H'.

At that time, the two youngest members of the band were 18 years old. They were offered a chance to play at Cr\u00fce Fest Hollywood in January 2005. The band accepted and traveled to California for the show. Only one disc had been recorded at that time: a four-song demo containing \"No One's Gonna Do It for You\", \"Hard to Be Vain\", \"Heartbreak Suicide\", and \"A.S.A.D.\" Heartbreak Suicide ended up becoming the band's most popular song.\nVains of Jenna captured the attention of Stevie Rachelle (Tuff singer, and the owner of hard rock website Metal Sludge) during their first ever performance in America, playing at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood during the charity event Cr\u00fce Fest Hollywood. Rachelle offered the band a demo deal and a manager's contract 48 hours later. Rachelle booked the band to record at Redrum Studios with his friend former Guns N' Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke producing. The band had only been in Los Angeles for one week when all this took place.After spending the winter in Sweden, they toured the United Kingdom in the spring of 2006. The band lived in guitarist Nicki's Volvo station wagon for a month between playing gigs around London and surrounding cities. In May, the group relocated to California. The band toured coast to coast, and in many cases were not old enough to play bars they were booked in, which had a minimum age of 21. This would sometimes leave half the band in the van outside, only to be let in to load up on stage, play, and then leave at the end of their set. One of these such tours was when Rachelle flew the band to the East Coast in the summer of 2006, where they played 1st slot in support of UK band Teenage Casket Company and The Erotics from New York. During the American East Coast tour in July 2006, the run was cut short, as Bam Margera of the show Jackass had recently signed the band to his Filthy Note Records label. Margera invited the band to his mansion to shoot a video for the song \"No One's Gonna Do It for You\", which Margera produced himself, and used \"Don't Give a Damn\" as the theme song to his upcoming MTV series Bam's Unholy Union. The band was featured in two episodes of the show.\nArticles in Spin, Metal Edge, Revolver, Blender, Hustler, and other international print magazines followed. They found themselves on TV shows such as Jackass Number Two on MTV, and LA Ink, featuring good friend and fan of the band Kat Von D. The band was a guest on her TV show, and at the MusInk Festival in Southern California, where she appeared.\n\nLit Up/Let Down, the band's debut full-length album, was released in stores on 24 October 2006. In early 2007, manager Rachelle called another old friend Bobby Dall of the band Poison. Rachelle had heard about the band's plan to tour in the summer with special guest Ratt. Rachelle pushed Dall to add the young band to the tour. After months of calls, the band was initially added to the side stage on several of the Live Nation produced events. As the tour grew closer, White Lion encountered some legal troubles and had to pull out. Since White Lion had to drop out, Rachelle pressured Dall to move his band onto the main stage for the Summer 2007 tour. After some time, it finally happened, and Vains of Jenna was added to the main stage for the entire North American 2007 summer tour. The band also toured the US on the Viva La Bands Tour along with Cradle of Filth, Gwar, and CKY in fall 2007. In late 2008 and early 2009, the band toured parts of Europe, including the UK, Italy, Scotland, Denmark, and Sweden. This included a spot on the Sweden Rock Festival in June 2009. Vains of Jenna then returned to the United States to record a new album. The new disc was produced by Brent Woods (Wildside). It included a cover of \"Refugee\" by Tom Petty, among other songs. The band released a new song, \"Get It On\", on iTunes in July 2009. On 15 September, Vains of Jenna released their second full-length album, The Art of Telling Lies. The band filmed a video for the first single \"Get It On\", and a second video with director Noah Shulman (Kings of Leon) in New York City for the following single \"Mind Pollution\".\nIn March 2010, frontman Lizzy DeVine announced he was parting ways. Less than a week after Lizzy's departure, the band hired Cast of Kings singer Jesse Forte as the new front man. In August, Vains of Jenna released an EP with a new song, \"We Can Never Die\", and new versions of \"Everybody Loves You When You're Dead\", \"The Art of Telling Lies\", and \"Better Off Alone\". In October 2010, the band returned to the US to begin the \"We Can Never Die\" tour and played shows in South America. In November, the band entered the studio with producer Adam Hamilton to record a \"special edition\" covers album for Deadline Cleopatra Records. The album, Reverse Tripped, was released on 5 April 2011. The first single/video is a cover of Cee Lo Green's \"Fuck You\". A radio edit is included called \"Forget You\". \"Reverse Tripped\" was followed by a 54 city North American Tour, and an equally long European tour.\nOn 21 January 2012, it was announced that Vains of Jenna lead singer Jesse Forte joined Lynch Mob; soon after this announcement their old lead singer returned, leaving Jesse out of Lynch Mob. Several days later, on 26 January, the following message was posted on Vains of Jenna's official Facebook & Myspace pages:\n\"Vains Of Jenna calls it quits.

The military action, along with the subsequent Battle of Tewkesbury, secured the throne for Edward IV. \nOn Sunday 14 April 1471, Easter Day, near Barnet, then a small Hertfordshire town north of London, Edward led the House of York in a fight against the House of Lancaster, which backed Henry VI for the throne. Leading the Lancastrian army was Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, who played a crucial role in the fate of each king. Historians regard the battle as one of the most important clashes in the Wars of the Roses, since it brought about a decisive turn in the fortunes of the two houses. Edward's victory was followed by 14 years of Yorkist rule over England.\nFormerly a key figure in the Yorkist cause, Warwick defected to the Lancastrians over disagreements about Edward's nepotism, secret marriage, and foreign policy. Leading a Lancastrian army, the earl defeated his former allies, forcing Edward to flee to Burgundy in October 1470. The Yorkist king persuaded his host, Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy, to help him regain the English throne. Leading an army raised with Burgundian money, Edward launched his invasion of England, which culminated at the fields north of Barnet. Under cover of darkness, the Yorkists moved close to the Lancastrians and clashed in a thick fog at dawn. As both armies fought, the Earl of Oxford on the Lancastrian right routed the Yorkists opposite under Lord Hastings, chasing them back to Barnet. On their return to the battlefield, Oxford's men were erroneously shot at by the Lancastrian centre commanded by Lord Montagu. As cries of treason (always a possibility in that chaotic period) spread through their line, Lancastrian morale was disrupted and many abandoned the fight. While retreating, Warwick was killed by Yorkist soldiers.\nWarwick had been such an influential figure in 15th-century English politics that, on his death, no one matched him in terms of power and popularity. Deprived of Warwick's support, the Lancastrians suffered their final defeat at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May, which marked the end of the reign of Henry VI and the restoration of the House of York. Three centuries after the Battle of Barnet, a stone obelisk was raised on the spot where Warwick purportedly died.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His son Anton Philipp completed his apprenticeship as a book printer and bookseller and borrowed money to purchase the Literarisches Museum, a lending library in Leipzig-Mitte, Grimmaische Strasse. During the Restoration period and under the terms of the Carlsbad Decrees, it quickly evolved to a centre of intellectual and literary circles of the pre-revolutionary Vorm\u00e4rz era.\nOn 1 October 1828 Anton Philipp Reclam founded his own publishing house, first named Verlag des literarischen Museums. When he sold the library in 1837, the company was renamed Philipp Reclam jun. Two years later, he also acquired a Leipzig printing workshop and he was then able to produce his books in large numbers. However, the liberal leaning tone of his publications earned him a sales ban in the countries of the Austrian Empire and a prison sentence by a Leipzig court for publishing a German translation of Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason (Das Zeitalter der Vernunft).After the failed German revolutions of 1848\u201349, Reclam changed his policies and concentrated on the mass distribution of literary classics. From 1858 to 1865 he published the complete works of William Shakespeare.\nIn 1856 the German Confederation passed a law giving 30 years copyright protection to the works of all authors who had died before 9 November 1837. From 9 November 1867, when all these rights ended, Reclam was able to publish German Enlightenment authors like Goethe, Schiller, Lessing and many others, without needing to pay any royalties, and thus sell them for lower prices. The first title of the Universal-Bibliothek series, Goethe's Faust I, was published on 10 November 1867.The Universal-Bibliothek enabled a wide range of literary texts to be made widely available, contributing significantly to popular education and the promotion of European classical literature. The firm strongly relied on the latest production methods and marketing strategies to attain consistently low sales prices. When Anton Philipp Reclam died in 1896, his Universal-Bibliothek comprised about 3,500 books. Title number 5,000 was published in 1908.\nIn 1912 Reclam became the first company to introduce book vending machines, designed by Peter Behrens, which soon became a great success and were found at train stations, hospitals and army barracks all over Germany. After World War I, it promoted the works of contemporary German-speaking authors, such as Klabund, Thomas Mann, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gerhart Hauptmann, Franz Werfel, Stefan Zweig, Arnold Zweig, and Ricarda Huch. The publisher celebrated its centenary in 1928, with Nobel laureate Thomas Mann delivering the main speech.During Nazi rule in Germany, Reclam was forbidden to publish books by Jewish authors, including Heinrich Heine and Ferdinand Lassalle, and works of 'politically unreliable' writers like Thomas Mann, Stefan Zweig, and Franz Werfel. In an allied bombing raid on Leipzig in World War II on 4 December 1943, its building was severely damaged and 450 tons of books were destroyed.After the partition of Germany in the aftermath of the war, the publishing house was divided after its owner, Ernst Reclam, was partially dispossessed in Leipzig, then part of the Soviet occupation zone. In September 1947, Reclam established a subsidiary in Stuttgart American occupation zone, later part of West Germany), which finally became the new main office in 1950. The original publishing house in Leipzig remained there, but was nationalized by the communist regime of East Germany.Both the West and the East German businesses continued to publish affordable paperback books. Reclam in Stuttgart introduced distinctive yellow covers for its Universal-Bibliothek series of German classics in 1970. In 1980, the company's West German head office moved from Stuttgart to new premises in nearby Ditzingen. After German reunification in 1990, the East German branch in Leipzig was reprivatised.

Vegetarian dim sims normally contain cabbage, carrot, vermicelli, Chinese shiitake mushrooms or other vegetable fillings, along with seasoning, although these are not generally available in commercial outlets.  \nDim sims differ from typical Chinese dumplings in that they are often much larger, have a thicker, doughier skin and are shaped more robustly.\nThey are primarily sold in fish and chip shops, service stations, corner shops, and some Chinese restaurants and takeaway outlets in Australia. Supermarkets, some Chinese yum cha wholesale outlets and Asian frozen food companies also commonly sell this snack frozen for home cooking. They can also be found at Chinese food outlets in New Zealand. \nThe term dim sim dates as far back as 1928, although the modern recipe of the dish most likely was developed in Melbourne's Chinatown in 1945 by entrepreneur William Chen Wing Young for his food processing  company Wing Lee.

The original IBP features prominently in Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation as the company that closed down the Chicago meatpacking district as a result of its industrial practices.\nIn 1967, IBP introduced boxed beef and pork, which were vacuum packed and in smaller portions. It was a new option then, when the traditional method of shipping product was in whole carcass form. The boxed meat also saved energy and transportation costs by eliminating the shipment of fat, bones and trimmings.\nWhen workers in the IBP plant in Dakota City went on strike in 1969, Holman and three top executives held secret meetings with Moe Steinman, a 'labour consultant' with close ties to La Cosa Nostra, in New York, who helped to end the New York butchers' boycott (in support of the meatpackers' strike). After a lengthy investigation of mob involvement in the New York City meat business, Currier J. Holman and IBP were tried and convicted in 1974 for bribing union leaders and meat wholesalers.To reflect the company's multiple operations, the company changed its name to Iowa Beef Processors, Inc. in 1970.

Shortly after, they recorded and released their debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US.

W. Hasselblad and Co. The founder's son, Arvid Viktor Hasselblad, was interested in photography and started the photographic division of the company. Hasselblad's corporate website quotes him as saying, \"I certainly don't think that we will earn much money on this, but at least it will allow us to take pictures for free.\"In 1877, Arvid Hasselblad commissioned the construction of Hasselblad's long-time headquarters building, in use until 2002. While on honeymoon, Arvid Hasselblad met George Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak. In 1888, Hasselblad became the sole Swedish distributor of Eastman's products. The business was so successful that in 1908, the photographic operations were spun off into their own corporation, Fotografiska AB. Operations included a nationwide network of shops and photo labs. Management of the company eventually passed to Karl Erik Hasselblad, Arvid's son (grandson of founder F. W.). Karl Erik wanted his son, Victor Hasselblad, to have a wide understanding of the camera business, and sent him to Dresden, Germany, then the world center of the optics industry, at age 18 (c. 1924).\nVictor spent the next several years studying and working in various photography related endeavors in Europe and the US, including Rochester, New York, with George Eastman, before returning to work at the family business.

Swan & Hunter merged with Wigham Richardson (founded by John Wigham Richardson as Neptune Works in 1860), specifically to bid for the important contract to build RMS Mauretania on behalf of Cunard. Their bid was successful, and the new company, Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd, went on to build what was to become, in its day, the most famous oceangoing liner in the world. Also in 1903, the Company took a controlling interest in the Wallsend Slipway & Engineering Company, which was an early licensed manufacturer of Parsons steam turbine engines, which enabled Mauretania to achieve her great speed. Mauretania was launched from Wallsend on 20 September 1906 by the Duchess of Roxburghe. The firm expanded rapidly in the early part of the twentieth century, acquiring the Glasgow-based Barclay Curle in 1912.In 1966, Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson merged with Smiths Dock Company to form Associated Shipbuilders, which later became Swan Hunter Group. Following the publication of the Geddes Report recommending rationalisation in British shipbuilding, the Company went on to acquire Clelands Shipbuilding Company and John Readhead & Sons in 1967. Meanwhile, Swan Hunter inherited both the Naval Yard at High Walker on the River Tyne of Vickers-Armstrongs and the Hebburn Yard of Hawthorn Leslie in 1968. In 1973 further expansion came with the purchase of Palmers Dock at Hebburn from Vickers-Armstrongs.Then in 1977, Swan Hunter Group was nationalised as part of British Shipbuilders. The former flagship of the Royal Navy, HMS Ark Royal was built at Swan Hunter during this period, entering service in 1985.The Company was privatised again in 1987 but decided to close its Neptune Yard in 1988. It was then forced to call in the receivers when the UK government awarded the contract for HMS Ocean to Kvaerner Govan in 1993. The receiver took steps to break up the business. However, the main shipyard in Wallsend was bought out from receivership by Jaap Kroese, a Dutch millionaire. The yard subsequently undertook several ad-hoc ship repair and conversion projects for private-sector customers.\nIn 2000, Swan Hunter was awarded the contract to design and build two (Auxiliary) Landing Ship Dock ships for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary with two other ships being built by BAE Systems Naval Ships: the cost of the two Swan Hunter ships was to be \u00a3210 million including \u00a362 million for lead yard services, with an inservice date of 2004. By July 2006, the costs had risen to \u00a3309 million and only one ship had been delivered. As a result of this, the second ship RFA Lyme Bay was transferred to BAE Systems Govan in Glasgow for completion.In 2001, Swan Hunter acquired Kv\u00e6rner's Port Clarence offshore yard at Teesside but then in 2006 sold it to Wilton Engineering Group.In November 2006, after the failure to complete Lyme Bay within budget and resulting exclusion from future Royal Navy shipbuilding projects, Jaap Kroese announced that the business was effectively finished and placed the Wallsend Yard's iconic cranes up for sale. He also said that he was actively looking for a buyer for the land. During this time, Lyme Bay's earlier sister ship, Largs Bay, was noted as the last ship to be built and fully completed by Swan Hunter. In April 2007, Swan Hunter's cranes, along with its floating dock and other equipment, were sold to Bharati Shipyards, India's second-largest private-sector shipbuilder. The entire plant machinery and equipment from Swan Hunter was dismantled and transported to India over six months to be rebuilt at Bharati Shipyards.Swan's performed the conceptual design of Pioneering Spirit, provisionally named Pieter Schelte, the world's largest platform installation/decommissioning and pipelay vessel. The basic design of the lifting systems was completed by the end of 2008, and detailed design of the hulls by May 2010.In 2008, the company said it was concentrating on ship design with just under 200 people employed.In 2016, Jaap Kroese died but the company said it would continue with its business of ship design. At the time, the company had 40 employees and contractors.Also in 2016, Swan Hunter was relaunched into the subsea industry by Gerard Kroese, the eldest son of former owner Jaap Kroese. Swan Hunter started to offer specialist equipment, design, engineering & project management services to the offshore renewables and subsea oil & gas energy markets. On 12 October 2016, the company announced the issue of a letter of intent for the design and build of a basket carousel loading tower. The company announced further equipment pool growth through a 15Te tensioner and 450Te reel drive system.

{"id": "740_515", "question": "Where was Change founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "17_48067", "text": "Like other parts of the world, climate in Idaho has changed dramatically over the geologic history of the Earth.  Paleo-climatic records give some indication of these changes.  The longest instrumented records of climate in Idaho extend back to the late 1800s.  Concern over human induced climate change through the emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and methane from agriculture and industry, are driving research efforts across the state at university, state, and federals levels to understand what the implications of climate change could be in Idaho.\nIn the big picture of greenhouse gas emissions, Idaho emits the least carbon dioxide per person of the United States, less than 23,000 pounds a year. It relies mostly on nonpolluting hydroelectric power from its rivers.Like other parts of the world, Idaho has seen significant temperature increases, especially in the last several decades.  From 1971 to 2005 the average annual observed temperature in the Snake River Plain, located in southern Idaho, has increased by 1.4 degrees Celsius based on data from 10 climate stations (Dubois, Ashton, Oakely, Pocatello, Aberdeen, Hazelton, Jerome, Boise, Nampa, and Payette).  Statistically the increasing temperature trends are most significant in the months of January, March, and April.  While precipitation has generally increased since the early 1900s, the high variability in precipitation makes the identification of precipitation trends statistically difficult.\nOver the course of the 21st century, climate in Idaho is expected to experience additional changes due both to 'natural' climate variability and due to feedbacks related to the interaction between climate variability and increasing greenhouse gases. For example, based on projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and results from the United Kingdom Hadley Centre\u2019s climate model (HadCM2), a model that accounts for both greenhouse gases and aerosols, by 2100 temperatures in Idaho could increase by 5 \u00b0F (2.8 \u00b0C) (with a range of 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) to 9 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C)) in winter and summer and 4 \u00b0F (2.2 \u00b0C) (with a range of 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) to 7 \u00b0F (3.9 \u00b0C)) in spring and fall. Precipitation is estimated to change little in summer, to increase by 10% in spring and fall (with a range of 5-20%), and to increase by 20% in winter (with a range of 10-40%). Other climate models may show different results, especially regarding estimated changes in precipitation. The impacts described in the sections that follow take into account estimates from different models. The amount of precipitation on extreme wet or snowy days in winter is likely to increase. The frequency of extreme hot days in summer would increase because of the general warming trend. It is not clear how the severity of storms might be affected, although an increase in the frequency and intensity of winter storms is possible.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It specialises in manufacturing portable radios, tonearms, speakers, and communications equipment. It was later headed by the founder's younger brother Niro Nakamichi. The company was originally established as a research and development firm in electronics and optics but later became known as a manufacturer of quality audio products. While its cassette decks were particularly well known, the company is also credited with audio innovations, such as self-centring record players, high-end DAT recorders, and ultra-compact slot-loading CD changers.\nIn the 1950s, Nakamichi developed one of the first open reel tape recorders in Japan under the Magic Tone brand. In 1957, it developed and made its own magnetic tape heads, as well as launching the Fidela 3-head Open Reel Stereo Tape Deck.\nBecause of its experience in manufacturing magnetic tape heads and equipment, in 1967 the company started making tape decks for a number of foreign manufacturers including Harman Kardon, KLH, Advent, Fisher, ELAC, Sylvania, Concord, Ampex and Motorola.\nFrom 1973, Nakamichi started to sell high-quality stereo cassette decks that benefited from the mass market's move away from reel-to-reel tape recorders to the cassette format. The Nakamichi 1000 and 700, made in the mid-1970s, had three heads, a dual capstan drive that reduced wow and flutter, and Dolby-B noise reduction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The dual capstan drive ensured superior head-to-tape contact, essentially eliminating reliance on the problematic spring pressure pads built into cassette housings. (Later models were fitted with pressure pad lifters that further improved tape travel stability and reduced head wear.) High-end features of these models included adjustable record head azimuth and Dolby calibration. The relatively high retail price of the 1000 and 700 prompted Nakamichi to offer lower-priced two-head models, such as the Nakamichi 500 and the wedge-shaped 600.\n\nThe Nakamichi 550 was a portable cassette recorder that had three microphone inputs: one for left channel, one for right channel, and one for a center blend channel. This recorder could run from batteries or AC and was used to make high quality recordings in the field.\nIn the late 1970s, Nakamichi updated and broadened its model range, with revised products including the Nakamichi 1000-II, the 700-II, and the lower-end 600-II. Nakamichi branched out into other audio components such as pre-amplifiers, power-amplifiers, tuners, receivers and later speakers.\nIn the early 1980s, Nakamichi's top-of-the-line cassette deck was the 1000ZXL, retailing at US$3,800, its price only exceeded by the 1000ZXL Limited at US$6,000. The updated 700ZXL sold for US$3,000, but Nakamichi also offered lower-end cassette decks under US$300. This time marked a peak in the market for cassette recorders, before it lost ground to digital recording media such as CD.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The group earned critical praise for their ethereal, effects-laden sound and the soprano vocals of Fraser, whose lyrics often eschew any recognisable language. They pioneered the 1980s alternative subgenre of dream pop and helped define what would become shoegaze.They signed with the record label 4AD in 1982 and released their debut album Garlands. The addition of Raymonde in 1983 solidified their final lineup, which produced their biggest hit in the UK, \"Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops\", peaking at No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1988 Cocteau Twins signed with Capitol Records in the United States, distributing their fifth album, Blue Bell Knoll, through a major label in the country. After the 1990 release of their most critically acclaimed album, Heaven or Las Vegas, the band left 4AD for Fontana Records, where they released their final two albums.\nAfter nearly 20 years together, the band disbanded in 1997 in part due to issues stemming from the disintegration of Fraser and Guthrie's romantic relationship. In 2005 the band announced that they would reunite to headline Coachella Festival and embark on a world tour but the reunion was cancelled a month later after Fraser \"couldn\u2019t bring herself to work with Guthrie\".

Soon after the coup, the junta of General Surayud Chulanont announced plans to merge CAT with rival state telecom enterprise TOT (Telephone Organization of Thailand).Before 2003, CAT was an abbreviation for Communications Authority of Thailand, a Thai government agency. Despite not having been privatized, CAT was still made into a state-owned enterprise (though without the IPO to Stock Exchange of Thailand). It became a public company (with 100% of shares held by the Thai government) with its name CAT, where CAT is no longer an abbreviation for the Communications Authority of Thailand. Any telecommunication regulation was transferred to the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC).\nThe junta appointed General Saprang Kalayanamitr as the new chairman of the board of directors for both CAT and TOT.  Saprang was accused by the founders of PTV, a new satellite television station, of being behind CAT's refusal to grant an internet link from Bangkok to a satellite up-link station in Hong Kong.  PTV was established by some previous executives of the Thai Rak Thai party.  CAT, however, claimed that it never received PTV's application for internet access.The junta also canceled the Thaksin government's telecom excise tax policy. The Thaksin government imposed an excise tax on private fixed and cellular services, and then allowed telecom companies to deduct the amount they paid in excise tax from concession fees to TOT and CAT.  The total amount paid by the private telecom firms did not change.  The Surayud government's excise tax cancellation meant that TOT and CAT would receive their full concession payments.  However, TOT and CAT were then forced to increase their dividends to the Ministry of Finance to account for their increased income.On 30 November 2013, during the mass protests going on in Bangkok, a group of unidentified protesters infiltrated CAT's headquarter, which hosted its data center, to cut off its electricity. This affected roughly 92,000 clients of the company and resulted in about 300 million baht ($10 million) in lost transactions.

{"id": "740_579", "question": "Where was The Cancer Conspiracy founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_18362", "text": "The Cancer Conspiracy was a progressive rock group from Burlington, Vermont, featuring guitarist Daryl Rabidoux, drummer/keyboardist/saxophonist Greg Beadle, and bassist Brent Frattini.  Rabidoux and Beadle were veterans of the local hardcore scene, and had broken away from their respective bands out of a need to try something new musically. Their initial plans were to find a vocalist and bassist, but after recruiting Frattini, decided to remain an instrumental trio.\nTheir style draws heavily upon 70s progressive rock, particularly King Crimson and Yes, as well as fusion, hardcore, and math rock.  Their first self-titled 3 song EP was released in 2001, consisting of 2 studio tracks and 1 live track. Their 9 song full-length debut The Audio Medium followed in 2002.  The album explored a number of sonic landscapes, and revolved around the concept of the corporate music industry's control of the masses; that people are sheep to what music corporations and radio stations tell them to listen to, unaware of the real music that exists out there.  As in the medical world, a \"cancer conspiracy\" that hides the cure for cancer for the purpose of making money from the sick.  The album booklet contained a letter from a doctor by the name of Dr. Travis John, who shared similar views and who warned the band of the trouble they were getting themselves into.\nThe band toured extensively with bandmates on their label Big Wheel Recreation, and also opened for Oysterhead's first tour. Their shows were sometimes augmented by video projections.  In 2003, while at a show in New York City, their van was stolen, along with all of their equipment.  This was the last and most disastrous in a series of mishaps that had plagued their tours.  They decided to call it a day in late 2003.  There were reports on the Big Wheel Recreation website that they were working on a second album, and songs have surfaced on P2P filesharing programs. The album is now being released by both Gilead and Radar Recordings, after years of legal issues surrounding the intellectual rights of the music.  The album, Omega, was released in January 2008. Rabidoux is now working full-time as an engineer and producer at Strangeways Recording Studio in Providence, Rhode Island.  He has also reunited with Frattini to form Deleted Arrows \"[1]\".  Beadle currently plays in a classic rock inspired band called Township in Roslindale, Massachusetts.\nThe Cancer Conspiracy reunited for the Rocketsled reunion show in Burlington, Vermont on January 21, 2017. The original lineup of Daryl Rabidoux, Greg Beadle, and Brent Frattini played two songs, \"Broken Heartbeats Gathered and Rebroadcast\" and \"Summer of Andy.\" On April 27, 2018 it was announced that the band would perform again, this time as part of a celebration of the life of Cave In bassist Caleb Scofield. The show took place on June 13, 2018, at the Royale in Boston, Massachusetts. Other artists performing include Scofield's own bands Cave In and Old Man Gloom.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Vocalist Paul Davidson, bassist Derek Peace, and drummer Jim Kovach joined with Gorle to form Heir Apparent's original lineup. In July 1984, the band entered Triad Studios in Redmond, WA to record a five-song demo that received local airplay on KISW and KZOK. A month after recording their first demo in 1984 Jim Kovach was replaced by Ray Schwartz (using the name Raymond Black). This lineup recorded Heir Apparent's debut studio album Graceful Inheritance.\nThe album was released for European market in January 1986 by an independent French label Black Dragon Records. Supported by UK's Metal Hammer magazine, Heir Apparent toured France, Netherlands, and Germany in May and June 1986, originally as support act, but ending as headliner on tour with Savage Grace. Germany's Rock Hard gave the album a rating of 49/50 points in the February 1986 issue. Encouraged by good sales, Black Dragon re-released the album in October 1986, this time on CD, making it one of the first CD's released by an independent label in Europe. Graceful Inheritance was never released in the US in the 1980s, the group's home country. Graceful Inheritance was ranked No. 188 in the German hardcover book, Best of Rock and Metal \u2013 Top 500 Albums of All Time, published in 2005.\nFollowing the departure of lead vocalist Paul Davidson in 1987, Steve Benito took over the singing duties. Also, Heir Apparent's lineup was changed into a quintet by adding a keyboard player Mike Jackson. The new lineup recorded Heir Apparent's second studio album One Small Voice, which marked a musical shift towards the more technical sound of progressive metal, compared to the traditional heavy and power metal style of the previous release. In the summer of 1988, Heir Apparent had their first large arena performance, serving as an opening act for David Lee Roth, in the Seattle Center Coliseum. Soon after that, the band had signed a seven-album contract in 1988 in a joint venture with Capitol Records/Metal Blade, but suddenly dissolved even before the official release of One Small Voice in June 1989. Without a concert support, and with the emergence of grunge in the Seattle area, the second album did not reach the debut's underground success and critical acclaim until many years later, compelling the Greek label Arkeyn Steel Records to release a digitally remastered limited edition of One Small Voice with bonus tracks and a live DVD from a 1988 concert video of this lineup in 2010.\nThe Germany's label Hellion Records released the Triad demo compilation album in late 1999, along with the re-issue of the band's first album Graceful Inheritance. The band stayed inactive until 2000 when guitarist Terry Gorle was invited to perform at Wacken Open Air festival. Gorle reunited with the original rhythm section of Ray Schwartz and Derek Peace, with addition of Michael James Flatters on vocals. Following that comeback performance, Terry Gorle led several different lineups in concerts between 2002 and 2004. The 2004 lineup of Terry Gorle (guitar), Bobby Ferkovich (bass), Op Sakiya (keyboards), Jeff McCormack (drums) and Peter Orullian (vocals) reunited to perform in Europe in November 2006, headlining Germany's Keep It True festival, and two additional shows in Greece.\nIn January 2012, Heir Apparent's original musicians (Gorle, Schwartz, and Peace) performed with Jeff Carrell on vocals at the Metal Assault II Festival in Germany, with additional concerts in Athens and Thessaloniki Greece in celebration of the 25th anniversary of Graceful Inheritance.\nIn October 2015, Heir Apparent performed their first concert in Italy at the Play It Loud Festival with vocalist Will Shaw and keyboardist Op Sakiya joining Gorle, Peace, and Schwartz. During 2016, Heir Apparent has co-headlining festival concerts in Greece at Up the Hammers and Germany at Keep It True. 2016 also brought limited edition releases on vinyl of material from the 1983 Nemesis demo, 1984 Inception Day demo, 1987\u201388 Triad demos, and Graceful Inheritance.Heir Apparent's third album, The View from Below, was released worldwide in October 2018 on No Remorse Records with Will Shaw on vocals, Terry Gorle on guitar, Derek Peace on bass, Ray Schwartz on drums, and Op Sakiya on keyboards.

Headquartered in Paris, with \u20ac139.7 billion in sales in 2023, EDF operates a diverse portfolio of at least 120 gigawatts of generation capacity in Europe, South America, North America, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\nIn 2009, EDF was the world's largest producer of electricity. Its 56 active nuclear reactors (in France) are spread out over 18 sites (nuclear power plants). They comprise 32 reactors of 900 MWe, 20 reactors of 1,300 MWe, and 4 reactors of 1,450 MWe, all PWRs.\nEDF was created on 8 April 1946 by the 1945 parliament, from the merging of various divided actors. EDF led France's post-war energy growth, with a unique focus on civil nuclear energy, through reconstruction and further industrialization within the Trente Glorieuses, being a flagship of France's new industrial landscape. In 2004, following integration into the European Common Market, EDF was privatized, although the government of France retained 84% equity. In 2017 EDF took over the majority of the reactor business Areva, in a French government-sponsored restructuring. That same year, following a wish to divest from nuclear energy, the possible closure of 17 of EDF's French nuclear power reactors by 2025 was announced. However, by 2022 this decision had been reversed, with the administration of president Emmanuel Macron announcing plans for a \"nuclear renaissance\", beginning with the projected construction of 6 EPR model 2 reactors with an option for 8 further reactors. Meanwhile, construction is ongoing on EPR model 1 reactors in France and Britain.\nFollowing privatization, decades of under-investment, and the 2021\u20132022 global energy crisis the Government of France announced the full renationalisation of the company for an estimated cost of \u20ac5 billion, which it completed in 2023.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "740_640", "question": "Where was Staedtler founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_18557", "text": "The origins of the brand can be traced since the 17th century, when Friedrich Staedtler took over the totality of the pencil manufacturing process, from the lead to the wood. However, that activity was forbidden by the Council of Nuremberg, which stated that the manufacturing had to be developed by two different experts. Eventually, Staedtler's work helped to abolish that regulation, therefore facilitating the work of other pencil manufacturers in Nuremberg.The company was founded by Johann Sebastian Staedtler in 1835 as a pencil factory, first established in Nuremberg, but the roots of the company go back to 1662, when references to Friedrich Staedtler as a pencil-making craftsman were made in the city annals. Staedtler received permission from the municipal council to produce black lead, red chalk and pastel pencils in his industrial plant. In 1866, the company had 54 employees and produced 15,000 gross (2,160,000 pencils) per year.\nIn 1900, Staedtler registered the Mars brand (which represented the Ancient Roman god of war), using the name for some lines of products, also launching the head of Mars logo, and the Staedtler products are distributed in Italy in the same year. In 1901 the Noris brand was released by the company.In 1922 a United States subsidiary (located in New York) was established, It was followed by a Japanese subsidiary four years later. In 1937 the name was changed to Mars Pencil and Fountain Pen Factory and the product range was expanded to include mechanical writing instruments. In 1949, Staedtler began the production of ballpoint pens, which started to be widely used instead of fountain pens (although Staedtler still produces the latter today).\nIn 1950 propelling pencils (or mechanical pencils) began to be manufactured, the first being made out of wood. Four years later, the \"Lumocolor\" brand was registered. This brand was used to design the wide range of Staedtler markers. The head of Mars became the Staedtler definitive logo in 1958. This logo has had several style modifications since then, the last in 2001.In 1962 the company began producing technical pens. In 1967 the Italian subsidiary, in Milan, was established. In the 1970s, Staedtler bought the Neumarkt factory, which used to be the Eberhard Faber factory. Nevertheless, in 2009 Staedtler sold the rights to the brand \"Eberhard Faber\" to Faber-Castell, although the company kept the Neumarkt factory, where Staedtler makes wood pencils nowadays.As from 2010, Fimo (modelling clay products), Mali, Aquasoft and further brands were marketed under the Staedtler name. In addition, the company celebrated its 175th anniversary that same year.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to Ryan Cooper of About.com and author Doyle Greene, Black Flag is one of the pioneers of the post-hardcore genre for the experimental style they later started playing. Black Flag experimented with a sludge metal sound on their album My War. Black Flag also have used elements of styles such as jazz, blues, spoken word, heavy metal, blues rock, free jazz, math rock, and instrumental music.Throughout their ten-year career as a band, Black Flag's experiences became legendary, especially in the Southern California area. Much of the band's history is chronicled in Henry Rollins' own published tour diary Get in the Van. Black Flag were reportedly blacklisted by the LAPD and Hollywood rock clubs because of the destructiveness of their fans, though Rollins has claimed that police caused far more problems than they solved.\nSST Records, an independent American record label that was initially founded to release Black Flag's debut single, released recordings by influential bands such as Bad Brains, Minutemen, Descendents, Meat Puppets, and H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. As well, SST released some albums by Negativland, Soundgarden,  Sonic Youth, and Saint Vitus.\nSST was founded in 1966 by Greg as Solid State Transmitters \u2013 later rebranded to release Black Flag albums.\n\nBlack Flag's career is chronicled in Our Band Could Be Your Life, a study of several important American underground rock bands. Many members of the grunge scene cited Black Flag's My War album as being influential in their departure from the standard punk model. Steve Turner of Mudhoney stated in an interview, \"A lot of other people around the country hated the fact that Black Flag slowed down ... but up here it was really great \u2013 we were like 'Yay!' They were weird and fucked-up sounding.\"\nKurt Cobain listed both My War and Damaged in his top 50 albums in his journal in 1993. Jeff Hanneman and Dave Lombardo, both known for their work with Slayer, mentioned Black Flag among their influences. Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea has a Black Flag decal on one of his signature Modulus bass guitars, and guitarist John Frusciante has cited Greg Ginn as one of his early influences as a guitar player. British acoustic artist and punk rocker Frank Turner has a Black Flag icon tattoo on his wrist and cites the band as one of his primary inspirations, particularly in regards to their work ethic. With Million Dead, if anything went wrong with their tour, Turner said they would \"Think Black Flag\". Vocalist Maynard James Keenan of the bands Tool and A Perfect Circle, has described seeing Black Flag perform in 1986 as a young punk rocker in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as a \"revelatory and life-changing\" experience. A Perfect Circle also covered the Black Flag song \"Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie\" on their Emotive album. Punk band Rise Against portrayed Black Flag in the 2005 Lords of Dogtown film, and their cover of \"Nervous Breakdown\" is on the Lords of Dogtown soundtrack. Rise Against also does a cover of the Black Flag song \"Fix Me\" in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland. Initial Records released a Black Flag cover album in 2002 (re-released with additional tracks in 2006 by ReIgnition Recordings), Black on Black: A Tribute to Black Flag. The compilation features 15 hardcore and metalcore bands \u2013 including Most Precious Blood, Converge, The Dillinger Escape Plan, American Nightmare, Drowningman, and Coalesce. Bring Me the Horizon frontman Oliver Sykes also mentioned Black Flag as one of his biggest influences. Sykes has also had the tattoo of Black Flag logo showing the love for the band.

In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars. Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The most recent models, the Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market, selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers. Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\" In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries. These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas, instead of near other auto dealerships.\nAnalysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software. The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.Tesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy. Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly. Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Speaking on their different ethnic backgrounds, the two jokingly describe themselves as \"the only successful Arab/Jewish partnership since the dawn of human culture.\"Around the time when they were both 15, Macklovitch joined Gemayel's band. During this time, Macklovitch's younger brother A-Trak (of Duck Sauce) started winning the Disco Mix Club Championships, becoming World Champion in 1997. After the band, Dave 1 and P-Thugg started to produce hip hop music together. Also at this time, Tiga was working with Dave 1 at a record store and asked Dave 1 to work on a project for his label, Turbo. Dave 1 and P-Thugg signed as Chromeo and started creating music together.\nReviews of their 2004 debut album, She's in Control, were mostly favorable. Critics compared the sound to 1980s groups Hall & Oates, Zapp, Prince, Klymaxx and Sylvester. \"Needy Girl\" became a worldwide club hit. According to Dave 1, \"She's in Control didn't blow up. But we had \"Needy Girl\", and \"Needy Girl\" was like a musical passport. That song went all around the world and DJs played it everywhere\". The song \"You're So Gangsta\" was featured as the theme tune for the PC game Space Colony.\nIn 2005, Chromeo released a mix CD of funky dance tracks on Eskimo Belgium records entitled Un Joli Mix Pour Toi (French for: A Nice Mix for You). In 2006, the group was featured in DJ Mehdi's song \"I Am Somebody\". During early 2007, Chromeo supported indie rock group Bloc Party on their British tour.\nAfter a three-year break, they released a second album, Fancy Footwork, which also received positive reviews. In 2008, Chromeo performed with Daryl Hall as a part of his online series Live from Daryl's House. They also performed with Hall at the 2010 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, TN.

Upon formation, the Mentors began to tour the Northwest, playing shows with their trademark executioner hoods (it was the idea of El Duce, who adored a horror movie called Mark of the Devil) and bawdy lyrics. In the early days of the band, El Duce would contact venues saying they were a Kiss cover band and send them a dubbed cassette with Kiss songs on it and say it was them, on one occasion he sent a copy of Deep Purple Live in Japan to what they thought was a club. It was later revealed to be a pizza place and they ended up playing a kid's birthday party, they were forced to stop after one song and were eventually given $50. Broy was in and out of the band during its early career due to his preoccupation with pursuing a degree in engineering. Other bassists from this era include Jeff Dahl, Chris Jacobsen (Jack Shit), and Mike Dewey (Heathen Scum Wezda).Through Mystic Records, the Mentors released their first EP, The Trash Bag, in 1983. Their first live album, Live at the Whiskey/Cathey de Grande, came out the following year; both records were produced by Phillip (Philco) Raves. In 1985, they signed to Death Records, a subsidiary of Metal Blade, and released their debut studio LP, You Axed for It!, with Broy returning on the bass. During this time, Hoke maintained a strong public presence, making a controversial appearance alongside fellow metal band GWAR on The Jerry Springer Show, where Hoke's band, beliefs, and public image were criticized.The Mentors did not achieve true notoriety until the 1985 Congressional hearings orchestrated by Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). The relatively obscure Mentors caught the attention of the PMRC with their song, \"Golden Shower\", prompting a reading of some of its lyrics on the Congressional floor.\nBroy was briefly replaced by bassists Wayne Daddio (\"Ripper\"), Ed Danky (\"Poppa Sneaky Spermshooter\"), Lucinda Rezabek (\"Scum Bitch\"), and\nKeith McAdam (\"Zippy\"), but later returned to the group. In 1989, the Mentors released their third album, Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Roll, a faux-live record. This album caught the attention of the band Revolting Cocks, who invited the Mentors on tour with them.They released Rock Bible in 1990, with Rick Lomas (\"Insect On Acid\") sitting in on drums. To the Max followed the next year. Clark Savage (\"Moosedick\") often filled in for Hoke on drums at live shows, as Hoke's alcoholism had made it difficult for him to play drums and sing simultaneously, eventually taking the position as drummer while Hoke became vocalist exclusively.\nThe Mentors remained sporadically active thereafter. Hoke began a solo career, while Carlson formed the band Jesters of Destiny. In 1997, while being interviewed for the documentary film Kurt and Courtney, Hoke claimed that Courtney Love had offered him $50,000 to kill her husband Kurt Cobain, whose death was ruled a suicide. Two days after being interviewed, Hoke died after being struck by a freight train while intoxicated. His death was alternately described as an accident and a suicide, however, some conspiracy theorists have claimed there is evidence suggesting foul play.Carlson, Broy and Savage continued the band and were joined by guitarist Jeff Solberg (\"Sickie J\") and vocalist Jake Huber (\"El Rapo\"), releasing Over the Top in 2005. In 2006 Singer and drummer Marc DeLeon (\"Mad Dog\"), of the Mentors tribute band The Mantors, replaced Huber and, later, Savage. 2009 saw the release of Ducefixion, their eighth full-length record. DeLeon left the Mentors in 2014 during the making of full-length documentary film called The Mentors: Kings of Sleaze Rockumentary, directed by April Jones.\nOn May 25, 2017, the Mentors released The Illuminaughty, their first studio album in eight years, with Broy and Lomas sharing the vocal duties.\nIn 2019, a documentary about the band and Hoke, The El Duce Tapes, was released to the festival circuit, featuring unreleased interviews with Hoke from 1990-91 and discussing the Mentors in the context of modern-day cancel culture.

{"id": "740_688", "question": "Where was Sobeys founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_18701", "text": "Sobeys was founded in Stellarton, Nova Scotia by John W. Sobey, a former carpenter, in 1907 as a meat delivery business.\nIn 1921, Sobey's son, Frank, became a partner of the company and added six new grocery stores serving the Pictou County and Antigonish County regions. In 1946, Sobey's opened its first supermarket in New Glasgow after purchasing the operations to Barker Store. By this time, Frank was the first president of J. W. Sobey Stores Limited. By late 1977, Sobeys had 65 store locations.The chain eventually expanded throughout Atlantic Canada. During most of the second half of the 20th century, it was the region's dominant grocer. In the 1980s, Sobeys expanded into southern Ontario, challenging Loblaws on its \"home turf\", thereby igniting what came to be a nationwide battle for market supremacy.\nSobeys had significant stakes in New England grocer Hannaford, Quebec grocer Provigo (which owned California grocer Petrini\u2019s), and US wholesaler Nash Finch Company until the 1990s. In 1998, Sobeys became the second-largest grocer in the country after purchasing the Oshawa Group, owners of the IGA franchise across Canada, along with several regional chains in Ontario, in addition to various food service and wholesale companies.\nIn 2002, Sobeys undertook major changes in its store design and customer service policies with the introduction of \"Ready to serve\". This initiative was reportedly an attempt to emulate the successful moves of the Publix supermarket chain in the southern United States.In 2005, Sobeys lost a bidding war with Quebec-based Metro to acquire A&P Canada, operator of several Ontario supermarket chains. The all-cash offer made by Sobeys was reportedly the highest bid for the chain, but the U.S. parent, The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, ultimately accepted Metro's $1.7 billion cash-and-stock offer. It is also suggested that the Sobey family was unwilling to cede any control to the Tengelmann Group, the ultimate parent company of A&P at the time. Though Sobeys remained the second largest grocery chain in Canada, it was the third place chain in most of the provinces outside the Atlantic region, and the successful purchase of A&P Canada would have helped to bolster its position in Ontario.\nIn 2007, Sobeys announced a $253 million takeover offer for the Thrifty Foods chain in British Columbia.In September 2011, Sobeys' wholesale division signed a long-term distribution agreement with American retailer Target for the supply of select food and grocery products to its Canadian stores. In March 2012, Sobeys acquired 236 Shell gas station locations in Quebec and Atlantic Canada.In June 2013, Sobeys announced the purchase of Safeway's Canadian operations for $5.8 billion, subject to regulatory approval. The acquisition added Safeway's 214 locations, primarily located in Western Canada, to its portfolio. As a condition of the deal imposed by the Competition Bureau in October 2013, Sobeys was required to sell 23 of its retail locations to other companies. Sobeys sold 29 of its locations, which included 18 Safeway stores. Fifteen were sold to Overwaitea Food Group (particularly in British Columbia and Alberta), and fourteen were sold to affiliates of Federated Co-operatives (particularly in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) for $430 million in total. In June 2014, Sobeys announced that it would, in the wake of the Safeway purchase, close 50 of its \"underperforming\" locations. The stores affected were primarily in Western Canada, although some in Ontario and the Atlantic region were also affected. In 2015, Sobeys acquired certain assets and select liabilities of Co-op Atlantic.In July 2016, Empire Company CEO Marc Poulin abruptly left the company after Sobeys reported a $942.6 million loss, which was credited to difficulties in integrating the Safeway chain into Sobeys overall operations. The Financial Post also reported that changes made by Sobeys, including the discontinuation of its popular loyalty program, the replacement of Safeway's house brands with Sobeys' brands, reports of poorly stocked inventories at Safeway locations, had impacted the chain's customer loyalty.In January 2018, Sobeys announced an agreement with Ocado to open an e-commerce grocery fulfilment centre in Toronto during late 2020. In contrast, Sobeys-owned Thrifty Foods and IGA use their stores as fulfilment centres for online orders.In late January 2018, Sobeys announced that it would, in the wake of the Safeway purchase, close an additional 10 of its \"underperforming\" locations. The stores affected were in the Fraser Valley Area of British Columbia in Western Canada, and were closed on May 5 with the exception of one of the ten stores that were closed on July 28. Some of the stores affected would reopen as FreshCo. As part of the FreshCo expansion in Western Canada, 22 locations have been confirmed, including the first two Chalo! FreshCo stores out West in Surrey, B.C.\nIn July 2019, Sobeys announced it will be switching from plastic to paper grocery bags in all its stores by the end of 2020.In September 2023, David Sobey, former chief executive and chair of the Sobeys Inc. grocery store chain, died at the age of 92.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "740_691", "question": "Where was Tiger founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "276_13660", "text": "Tiger in a Tropical Storm or  Surprised! is an 1891 oil-on-canvas painting by Henri Rousseau. It was the first of the jungle paintings for which the artist is chiefly known. It shows a tiger, illuminated by a flash of lightning, preparing to pounce on its prey in the midst of a raging gale.\nUnable to have a painting accepted by the jury of the Acad\u00e9mie de peinture et de sculpture, or the Academy of Painting and Sculpture, Rousseau exhibited Tiger in a Tropical Storm in 1891 under the title Surpris!, at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, which was unjuried and open to all artists. The painting received mixed reviews. Rousseau had been a late developer: his first known work, Landscape with a Windmill, was not produced until he was 35, and his work is marked by a na\u00efvet\u00e9 of composition that belies its technical complexity. Most critics mocked Rousseau's work as childish, but F\u00e9lix Vallotton, a young Swiss painter who was later to be an important figure in the development of the modern woodcut, said of it:\n\nHis tiger surprising its prey is a 'must-see'; it's the alpha and omega of painting and so disconcerting that, before so much competency and childish na\u00efvet\u00e9, the most deeply rooted convictions are held up and questioned.\nHe (Rousseau's tiger) is derived from a motif found in the drawings and paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. It was claimed, either by Rousseau himself or by his friends and admirers, that he had experienced life in the jungle during his time in Mexico in 1860, where he had served as a regimental bandsman. In fact he never left France, and it is thought that his inspiration came from the botanical gardens of Paris, such as the Jardin des Plantes (which included zoological galleries with taxidermy specimens of exotic animals), and from prints and books. The fin de si\u00e8cle French populace was captivated by exotic and dangerous subjects, such as the perceived savagery of animals and peoples of distant lands. Tigers on the prowl had been the subject of an exhibition at the 1885 \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. Emmanuel Fr\u00e9miet's famous sculpture of 1887 depicting a gorilla carrying a woman exuded more savagery than anything in Rousseau's canvases, yet was found acceptable as art; Rosseau's poor immediate reception therefore seems the result of his style and not his subject matter.The tiger's prey is beyond the edge of the canvas, so it is left to the imagination of the viewer to decide what the outcome will be, although Rousseau's original title Surprised! suggests the tiger has the upper hand. Rousseau later stated that the tiger was about to pounce on a group of explorers. Despite their apparent simplicity, Rousseau's jungle paintings were built up meticulously in layers, using a large number of green shades to capture the lush exuberance of the jungle. He also devised his own method for depicting the lashing rain by trailing strands of silver paint diagonally across the canvas, a technique inspired by the satin-like finishes of the paintings of William-Adolphe Bouguereau.\nAlthough Tiger in a Tropical Storm brought him his first recognition, and he continued to exhibit his work annually at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, Rousseau did not return to the jungle theme for another seven years, with the exhibition of Struggle for Life (now lost) at the 1898 Salon. Responses to his work were little changed; following this exhibition, one critic wrote, \"Rousseau continued to express his visions on canvas in implausible jungles... grown from the depths of a lake of absinthe, he shows us the bloody battles of animals escaped from the wooden-horse-maker\". Another five years passed before the next jungle scene, Scouts Attacked by a Tiger (1904). The tiger appears in at least three more of his paintings: Tiger Hunt (c. 1895), in which humans are the predators; Jungle with Buffalo Attacked by a Tiger (1908); and Fight Between a Tiger and a Buffalo (1908).\nHis work continued to be derided by the critics up to and after his death in 1910, but he won a following among his contemporaries: Picasso, Matisse, and Toulouse-Lautrec were all admirers of his work. Around 1908, the art dealer Ambroise Vollard purchased Surprised! and two other works from Rousseau, who had offered them at a rate considerably higher than the 190 francs he finally received. The painting was later purchased by the National Gallery, London in 1972 with a contribution from the billionaire philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "740_692", "question": "Where was Marillion founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_18724", "text": "The chief music critic of The Guardian, Alexis Petridis, has described Marillion as \"perennially unfashionable prog-rockers\". On the subject of joining the band in 1989, Steve Hogarth said in a 2001 interview: \"At about the same time, Matt Johnson of The The asked me to play piano on his tour. I always say I had to make a choice between the most hip band in the world, and the least.\" In the same conversation, he said: \"We're just tired of the opinions of people who haven't heard anything we've done in ten years. A lot of what's spread about this band is laughable.\"Much of the band's enduring and unfashionable reputation stems from their emergence in the early 1980s as the most commercially successful band of the neo-prog movement, an unexpected revival of the progressive rock musical style that had fallen out of critical favour in the mid-1970s. Some early critics were quick to dismiss the band as clones of Peter Gabriel-era Genesis due to musical similarities, such as their extended songs, a prominent and Mellotron-influenced keyboard sound, vivid and fantastical lyrics and the equally vivid and fantastical artwork by Mark Wilkinson used for the sleeves of their albums and singles.  Lead singer Fish was also often compared with Gabriel due to his early vocal style and theatrical stage performances, which in the early years included wearing face paint.\n\nAs Jon Wilde summarised in Melody Maker in 1989: At the end of a strange year for pop music, Marillion appeared in November 1982 with \"Market Square Heroes\". There were many strange things about 1982, but Marillion were the strangest of them all. For six years, they stood out of time. Marillion were the unhippest group going.  As punk was becoming a distant echo, they appeared with a sound and an attitude that gazed back longingly to the age of Seventies pomp.  When compared to Yes, Genesis and ELP, they would take it as a compliment. The Eighties have seen some odd phenomena. But none quite as odd as Marillion. Along the way, as if by glorious fluke, they turned out some singles that everybody quietly liked \u2013 \"Garden Party\", \"Punch and Judy\" and \"Incommunicado\". By this time, Marillion did not need the support of the hip-conscious. They were massive. Perhaps the oddest thing about Marillion was that they became one of the biggest groups of the decade. They might have been an anomaly but they were monstrously effective.\nThe band's unfashionable reputation and image has often been mentioned in the media, even in otherwise positive reviews. In Q in 1987, David Hepworth wrote: \"Marillion may represent the inelegant, unglamorous, public bar end of the current Rock Renaissance but they are no less part of it for that. Clutching at Straws suggests that they may be finally coming in from the cold.\" In the same magazine in 1995, Dave Henderson wrote: \"It's not yet possible to be sacked for showing an affinity for Marillion, but has there ever been a band with a larger stigma attached?\" He also argued that if the album Afraid of Sunlight \"had been made by a new, no baggage-of-the-past combo, it would be greeted with open arms, hailed as virtual genius.\" In Record Collector in 2002, Tim Jones argued they were \"one of the most unfairly berated bands in Britain\" and \"one of its best live rock acts.\" In 2004, Classic Rock's Jon Hotten wrote: \"That genre thing has been a bugbear of Marillion's, but it no longer seems relevant. What are Radiohead if not a progressive band?\" and said Marillion were \"making strong, singular music with the courage of their convictions, and we should treasure them more than we do.\" In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, an article on Marillion written by Mick Wall described them as \"probably the most misunderstood band in the world\".\nIn 2007, Stephen Dalton of The Times stated: The band have just released their 14th album, Somewhere Else, which is really rather good. Containing tracks that shimmer like Coldplay, ache like Radiohead and thunder like Muse, it is better than 80 per cent of this month's releases. But you are unlikely to hear Marillion on British radio, read about them in the music press or see them play a major festival. This is largely because Marillion have \u2013 how can we put this kindly? \u2013 an image problem. Their music is still perceived as bloated, bombastic mullet-haired prog-rock, even by people who have never heard it. In fairness, they did once release an album called Script for a Jester's Tear. But, come on, we all had bad hair days in the 1980s.\nDespite publishing a very good review for their 1995 album Afraid of Sunlight and including it in their 50 Best Albums of 1995, Q refused to interview the band or write a feature on them. Steve Hogarth later said: \"How can they say, this is an amazing record... no, we don't want to talk to you? It's hard to take when they say, here's a very average record... we'll put you on the front cover.\"In 2001, the television critic of The Guardian, Gareth McLean, used his review of the Michael Lewis BBC Two documentary, Next: The Future Just Happened, to concentrate on launching a scathing attack on the band, whose appearance only constituted one segment of the programme. He described them as \"once dodgy and now completely rubbish\" and he characterised their fans as \"slightly simple folks\". He also dismissed the band's efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: \"One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion.\"Rachel Cooke, a writer for The Observer and New Statesman, has repeatedly referred negatively to the band and insulted their fans in her articles.\nIn an interview in 2000, Hogarth expressed regret about the band retaining their name after he joined: If we had known when I joined Marillion what we know now, we'd have changed the name and been a new band. It was a mistake to keep the name, because what it represented in the mid-Eighties is a millstone we now carry. If we'd changed it, I think we would have been better off. We would have been judged for our music. It's such a grave injustice that the media constantly calls us a 'dinosaur prog band'. They only say that out of ignorance because they haven't listened to anything we've done for the last 15 bloody years. If you hear anything we've done in the last five or six years, that description is totally irrelevant... It's a massive frustration that no-one will play our stuff. If we send our single to Radio 1 they say: 'Sorry, we don't play music by bands who are over so-many years old... and here's the new U2 single.' I suppose it's something everyone has to cope with \u2013 every band are remembered for their big hit single, irrespective of how much they change over the years. But you can only transcend that by continuing to have hits. It's Catch 22. You know, at some stage, someone has to notice that we're doing interesting things. Someday someone will take a retrospective look at us and be surprised.\nThe 2013 film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa includes a joke reference to a former drummer of the band. The band were quoted: \"We know Marillion are seen as 'uncool' but we were delighted to be a part of it.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Talbot also performed solo with a guitar and phrase-sampling, looping and droning devices.Gravenhurst is described as dark and atmospheric, veering between the noisy shoegazing sound of guitar bands such as My Bloody Valentine, the harmony-laden singer-songwriter territory of Simon and Garfunkel, and the intricate fingerpicking guitar styles of Bert Jansch and Nick Drake. Earlier releases were grounded in acoustic and folk styles, while Fires in Distant Buildings made moves towards psychedelic rock. Flying Saucer Attack, a Bristol outfit who released a series of feedback-drenched, folk-inspired albums in the early 1990s, have been cited by Talbot as a major influence.A constant in the Gravenhurst sound is Talbot's fragile voice and vocal harmonies, intricate guitar work and unsettling and mysterious lyrical themes.Gravenhurst wrote and recorded original soundtrack music for the film Ein Freund von mir. As well as the bespoke \"Song Among the Pine\", the Gravenhurst songs \"Animals\", \"The Velvet Cell\" and \"Song from Under the Arches\" feature prominently in the film.

In the 1830s when it was first discovered, the mosaic was thought to represent a battle scene depicted in the Iliad, but architectural historians have found the mosaic actually depicts the Battle of Issus in 333 BC between Alexander the Great and Darius III of Persia, which took place about 150 years before the House of the Faun was constructed. This mosaic may be inspired by or copied from a Greek painting finished in the late fourth century BC, probably by the artist Philoxenus of Eretria.

{"id": "740_796", "question": "Where was No Kids founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_7364", "text": "In the years following its release, Kid A attracted acclaim. In 2005, Pitchfork wrote that it had \"challenged and confounded\" Radiohead's audience, and subsequently \"transformed into an intellectual symbol of sorts ... Owning it became 'getting it'; getting it became 'anointing it'.\" In 2015, Sheffield likened Radiohead's change in style to Bob Dylan's controversial move to rock music, writing that critics now hesitated to say they had disliked it at the time. He described Kid A as the \"defining moment in the Radiohead legend\". A year later, Billboard argued that Kid A was the first album since Bowie's Low to have moved \"rock and electronic music forward in such a mature fashion\". In an article for Kid A's 20th anniversary, the Quietus suggested that the negative reviews had been motivated by rockism, the tendency among music critics to venerate rock music over other genres.In a 2011 Guardian article about his critical Melody Maker review, Beaumont wrote that though his opinion had not changed, \"Kid A's status as a cultural cornerstone has proved me, if not wrong, then very much in the minority ... People whose opinions I trust claim it to be their favourite album ever.\" In 2014, Brice Ezell of PopMatters wrote that Kid A is \"more fun to think and write about than it is to actually listen to\" and a \"far less compelling representation of the band's talents than The Bends and OK Computer\". In 2016, Dorian Lynskey wrote in The Guardian: \"At times, Kid A is dull enough to make you fervently wish that they'd merged the highlights with the best bits of the similarly spotty Amnesiac ... Yorke had given up on coherent lyrics so one can only guess at what he was worrying about.\"Grantland credited Kid A for pioneering the use of internet to stream and promote music, writing: \"For many music fans of a certain age and persuasion, Kid A was the first album experienced primarily via the internet \u2013 it's where you went to hear it, read the reviews, and argue about whether it was a masterpiece ... Listen early, form an opinion quickly, state it publicly, and move on to the next big record by the official release date. In that way, Kid A invented modern music culture as we know it.\" In his 2005 book Killing Yourself to Live, critic Chuck Klosterman interpreted Kid A as a prediction of the September 11 attacks.Speaking at Radiohead's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2019, David Byrne of Talking Heads, one of Radiohead's formative influences, said: \"What was really weird and very encouraging was that [Kid A] was popular. It was a hit! It proved to me that the artistic risk paid off and music fans sometimes are not stupid.\" In 2020, Billboard wrote that the success of the \"challenging\" Kid A established Radiohead as \"heavy hitters in the business for the long run\".", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "740_797", "question": "Where was Daysend founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_18999", "text": "Daysend were formed in mid-2002 by Aaron Bilbija on guitars, Matt Lamb on drums and Meredith Webster on bass guitar. All three had been members of a thrash metal band, Psi.Kore, which were founded by Lamb's brother Chuck, guitarist Adam Boyle and bassist Lex Dourian in 1996; Lamb had joined in 1997 and Webster took Dourian's place in late 1998. The band recorded an EP with Chatterbox Records in 2000 and toured Australia widely before Bilbija was recruited in early 2002. Relations within the group pushed Chuck Lamb out and the remaining members decided to continue in a slightly different musical direction. In 1995, Bilbija had formed a death metal band called Deadspawn and with the eventual line-up of himself plus Dave Micallef (vocals, guitar), Bob Latsombath (bass) and Wayne Morris (drums), that group had released an album on Warhead Records in 1999 before eventually splitting up when Micallef left in mid-2001. Bilbija now recruited Micallef into his latest band, and Daysend was formed with guitarist Michael Kordek (from a death metal act called Automation and then, briefly, Infernal Method with Bilbija) also coming into the group. The line-up was only together briefly before Matt Lamb left, his place taken by Morris. Lamb has since played in a variety of Sydney rock and metal bands.\nA debut live show with Melbourne death metal band Earth was booked but Micallef quit Daysend before the show; the band played regardless as an instrumental act. Inheriting Psi.Kore's manager, Chatterbox owner Nik Tropiano, who had helped push that group to the verge of major success, Daysend was listed on the bill for the 2002 Metal for the Brain festival and slated to open for Austrian death metal band Pungent Stench shortly afterward, both without so much as having either a recording or a vocalist. However, Metal for the Brain was cancelled due to an insurance cost blow-out and Daysend had still not found a singer in time for the Pungent Stench tour. In January 2003, Simon Calabrese was recruited as lead vocalist. Calabrese had previously been with a nu metal act called Redsands that had recorded an EP before disbanding.\nWith Calabrese in place, Daysend immediately found themselves supporting Sweden's The Haunted in March and then on a national tour with the reformed Melbourne grindcore band Damaged. After that, Daysend spent ten days recording the debut album  Severance, which was released by Chatterbox in October. Severance was voted Best Australian Metal Album in a Triple J listeners poll soon after, an honour it shared with Renascent Misanthropy by Brisbane black metal band Astriaal.\n2004 saw Daysend touring heavily. They supported Slipknot, In Flames, Shadows Fall and Machine Head and toured nationally with Entombed. Severance was released in the United States by Metal Blade Records and by Locomotive in Europe in November. When the Metal for the Brain festival added two extra shows in Brisbane and Perth along with its regular Canberra fixture in February 2005, Daysend appeared at each. Two days before this, however, Kordek suddenly left the band. His replacement was Andrew Lilley, who had most recently served a brief spell with Melbourne thrash band Atomizer. Lilley's addition to Daysend caused some initial surprise as he had been fired from Psi.Kore in mid-2001, then coincidentally joined Infernal Method after Bilbija had left to join Psi.Kore. However, after learning the band's entire set in one emergency rehearsal, he slotted into the Daysend line-up.\nIn May 2005, Daysend toured the US for six weeks with Otep. On returning to Australia, the band split with both its management and with Lilley. Michael Kordek rejoined and some work began on a second album. Further activity was stalled however when Simon Calabrese left Daysend in May 2006. Within a short time, however, ex-Headcage vocalist Mark Halcroft (McKernan) joined the band. Playing just two shows with him, Daysend began recording The Warning in November 2006 with DW Norton, who had also produced the debut. Norton signed the band to his label Faultline and the album was released on 28 May 2007 ahead of Daysend's appearance at Sydney's two-day Come Together Festival. A national tour began soon after but at least one show was cancelled when Morris received an eye injury from a broken drumstick during a show in Sydney on 13 July.\nIn late November 2007, Michael Kordek left the band to follow \"other musical and non-musical interests\". He was replaced by Jason Turnbull in late 2007, playing his first show with the band on New Year's Eve. In July 2008 Daysend then travelled to New Zealand for a small tour with Subtract. August saw Daysend play a string of shows with Perth band Dyscord, and be the direct support for Trivium's one off Australian show at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney. In October, Daysend supported renowned UK metal band Carcass at Sydney's Metro Theatre, before playing a string of New South Wales shows with Dyscord, Psycroptic and the US deathcore band Whitechapel in early January 2009. Following this, Daysend began recording their third album as a four-piece since Turnbull had left the group. Within the Eye of Chaos was released on 19 February 2010, on the Stomp label. A national tour followed with Braithe Selby as a touring member. On 10 July 2010, the band played Utopia Records 30th Anniversary show which marked the return of Jason Turnbull to the line-up.\nDaysend played only a handful of shows throughout the year. In 2011 it was announced that Daysend would be touring Australia with Nevermore in June; however, that tour was cancelled. On 5 May, Daysend announced through their Facebook page that they were disbanding: \"The reason is not due to artistic differences or personal issues but rather that we feel we cannot continue with the band any longer. We would like to extend our sincerest thanks to our family and friends who have supported us over the years and most of all, our loyal fans\". The announcement was carried by various Australian metal websites.\nIn June 2019, Daysend's full discography was added to major music streaming services.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Initially, the group's sound was a fusion of psychedelic rock with traditional folk elements originating from Brazil.Originally, the group only played with Pepeu Gomes and Jorginho Gomes during their live performances. However, as time progressed, Gomes started to gain an increasingly important role in the group. After he married Consuelo, Gomes became a full-fledged member of the group, and began arranging songs along with Moreira.\nIn the early 1970s, the group's music began to gravitate more towards the MPB genre, particularly due to Brazilian musician Jo\u00e3o Gilberto's influence, who frequently visited the group. In 1972, Novos Baianos moved to Cantinho do Vov\u00f4, a property located in Jacarepagu\u00e1, where the group members lived in a communal style. Shortly after moving onto the property, the group began writing and recording material for a new album, which was produced amidst the ongoing military dictatorship in Brazil at the time. As a response to the melancholic sound of their musical contemporaries, the group set out to create a record that would bring a sense of joyfulness to listeners in the face of the authoritarian regime that was in power at the time.\nThese recording sessions produced the group's second studio album, Acabou Chorare. The album was a commercial success, due in part to the extensive airplay of songs on Brazilian radio stations at the time of the album's release. The album contained some of the group's most popular songs, which included 'Brasil Pandeiro', 'Preta Pretinha', 'Mist\u00e9rio do Planeta' and 'Besta \u00e9 tu'. It was released on the Som Livre label in 1972, and years later would be ranked as the best Brazilian music album by Rolling Stone magazine. It was around this time that the group incorporated A Cor do Som as an auxiliary band.\n\nDuring this period, the group lived out of a garage, where they primarily focused on playing soccer and composing music. This period of time influenced the name of their third studio album, Novos Baianos F.C., recorded and released on the Continental label in 1973. The group had a strong hippie image during this time period.\nThe band released numerous records until their break-up in 1978. In 1974, they recorded the first album without Moreira, who decided to start his own solo career in the mid-1970s. As Moreira had previously been the primary composer and arranger of the band's songs (along with Galv\u00e3o and Gomes) throughout their previous albums, it was tremendous loss to the group. The remaining members of the group continued producing music after Moreira's departure, incorporating Gato F\u00e9lix to the group.In 1976, Carvalho left the group to begin recording and releasing original music with A Cor do Som. In his place, Novos Baianos substituted Didi, the brother of Pepeu Gomes, as the group's bassist. However, the group disbanded in 1979 due to various band members starting their own solo careers. Despite the band's dissolution, Novos Baianos' members reunited many times to celebrate special events (most notably in 1997 and 2015).\nIn 1997, Luiz Galv\u00e3o, published Anos 70: Novos e Baianos for Editora 34. In the book, he documents the group's history and its importance to Brazilian music. After Galv\u00e3o released the book, the group reunited, releasing  the live album Infinito Circular in 1997, which was recorded in Metropolitan, Rio de Janeiro. In 2007, Moreira published A Hist\u00f3ria dos Novos Baianos e Outros Versos, a cordel text on the group.\nIn 2009, the band reunited without Moreira to celebrate 40 years of Novos Baianos and their revolutionary role in Brazilian music. The group (with Moreira) later released their second live album in 2017, titled Acabou Chorare - Novos Baianos Se Encontram, which was recorded during the group's 2015-2018 tour.\nMoreira died of a heart attack on 13 April 2020, aged 72. Later that year, the remaining members of the group's original line-up reunited for a show at the Festival Coala music event, as a tribute to Moreira. Galv\u00e3o later died from an undisclosed illness on 22 October 2022, aged 87.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The new company received licenses to key cryptographic patents held by RSA (set to expire in 2000) and a time-limited non-compete agreement. The new company served as a certificate authority (CA) and its initial mission was \"providing trust for the Internet and Electronic Commerce through our Digital Authentication services and products\". Prior to selling its certificate business to Symantec in 2010, Verisign had more than 3 million certificates in operation for everything from military to financial services and retail applications, making it the largest CA in the world.\nIn 2000, Verisign acquired Network Solutions for $21billion, which operated the .com, .net and .org TLDs under agreements with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the United States Department of Commerce. Those core registry functions formed the basis for Verisign's naming division, which by then had become the company's largest and most significant business unit. In 2002, Verisign was charged with violation of the Securities Exchange Act. Verisign divested the Network Solutions retail (domain name registrar) business in 2003 for $100million, retaining the domain name registry (wholesale) function as its core Internet addressing business.For the year ended December 31, 2010, Verisign reported revenue of $681 million, up 10% from $616 million in 2009. Verisign operates two businesses, Naming Services, which encompasses the operation of top-level domains and critical Internet infrastructure, and Network Intelligence and Availability (NIA) Services, which encompasses DDoS mitigation, managed DNS and threat intelligence.\nOn August 9, 2010, Symantec completed its approximately $1.28 billion acquisition of Verisign's authentication business, including the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate Services, the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Services, the Verisign Trust Services, the Verisign Identity Protection (VIP) Authentication Service, and the majority stake in Verisign Japan. The deal capped a multi-year effort by Verisign to narrow its focus to its core infrastructure and security business units. Following ongoing controversies regarding Symantec's handling of certificate validation, which culminated in Google untrusting Symantec-issued certificates in its Chrome web browser, Symantec sold this unit to DigiCert in 2017 for $950 Million.On 14 December 2021, the Ministry of Justice, Communication and Foreign Affairs of the Tuvalu Government announced on Facebook that they have selected GoDaddy Registry as the new registry service provider for the domain after Verisign did not participate in the renewal process.In 2011, Verisign was selected by the General Services Administration (GSA) to operate the registry services for the .gov top-level domain. They continued to operate .gov service until 2023, when Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) chose Cloudflare to replace Verisign as the .gov operator.Verisign's share price tumbled in early 2014, hastened by the U.S. government's announcement that it would \"relinquish oversight of the Internet's domain-naming system to a non-government entity\". Ultimately ICANN chose to continue VeriSign's role as the root zone maintainer and the two entered into a new contract in 2016.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "740_846", "question": "Where was Innocenti founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_19124", "text": "After World War II, the company was famous for many years for Lambretta scooters models such as the Lambretta 48, LI125, LI150, TV175, TV200, SX125, SX150, SX200, GP125, GP150 and GP200.\nFrom 1961 to 1976, Innocenti built under licence the BMC (later the British Leyland Motor Corporation / BLMC) Mini, with 848, 998 cc and 1,275 cc engines, followed by other models, including, from 1973, the Regent (Allegro), with engines up to 1,485 cc. The company of this era is commonly called Leyland Innocenti. The Innocenti Spyder (1961\u201370) was a re-bodied version of the Austin-Healey MKII Sprite (styling by Ghia). The car was produced by OSI, near Milan. In 1972, BLMC took over control of the company.\nIn 1972, the company's land, buildings and equipment were purchased by British Leyland in a deal involving approximately \u00a33 million. The British company had high hopes for its newly acquired subsidiary at a time when, they reported to the UK press, Italian Innocenti sales were second only to those of Fiat and ahead of Volkswagen and Renault: there was talk of further increasing annual production from 56,452 in 1971 to 100,000. However, the peak production under BLMC was 62,834 in 1972, in spite of exports increasing from one car in 1971 to more than 17,000 in 1974. Demonstrating their ambitions, the British company installed as managing director one of their youngest UK based senior executives, the 32-year-old former financial controller Geoffrey Robinson. Three years later, BLMC ran out of money and was nationalised by the UK government.\n\nIn February 1976, the company passed to Alejandro de Tomaso and was reorganised by the De Tomaso Group under the name Nuova Innocenti. Benelli had a share and British Leyland retained five percent with De Tomaso owning forty-four percent with the aid of a rescue plan from GEPI (an Italian public agency intended to provide investment for troubled corporations). Management was entirely De Tomaso's responsibility, however, and later in 1976, GEPI and De Tomaso combined their 95% of Innocenti (and all of Maserati) into one new holding company.However, with the loss of the original Mini, the Austin I5 and the (slow-selling) Regent, sales were in free fall. Production was nearly halved in 1975 and was down to about a fifth of the 1974 levels in 1976. After this crisis, the new Bertone-bodied Mini began selling more strongly and production climbed to a steady 40,000 per annum by the end of the 1970s. The first models had Bertone-designed five-seater bodywork and was available with Leyland's 998 cc and 1,275 cc engines.\nExports, which had been carried out mainly by British Leyland's local concessionaires, began drying up in the early eighties as BL did not want to see internal competition from the Innocenti Mini. Sales to France (Innocenti's biggest export market) ended in 1980, with German sales coming to a halt in 1982. Around the same time, the engine deal with Leyland ended and production soon dropped into the low twenty thousands. Having lost their engine supply as well as their entire export dealer net, Innocenti found themselves without a product and the means of selling it.\nHowever, Daihatsu of Japan were in need of a European partner. In addition to providing drivetrains, Daihatsu gave Innocenti access to their burgeoning sales network, entering France, Belgium and Switzerland at first. Daihatsu gained access to the Italian market, and a means of entry into other European nations with steep barriers for Japanese-made cars. That Innocenti, like Daihatsu, was a small-car specialist only made the marriage even more suitable. And so it was that, from model year 1983 on, the Innocenti was completely re-engineered, now using the Daihatsu Charade's 993 cc three-cylinder engine and an entirely new suspension. The appearance did not change in the least, in spite of it being, in essence, a new car. De Tomaso developed a turbocharged version of this engine for Daihatsu which found use in both Innocenti and Daihatsu cars.In addition to building their own cars, De Tomaso also had Innocenti use their factory capacity in producing bodywork for and providing final assembly of the Maserati Biturbo, Quattroporte and the Chrysler TC by Maserati. As production kept decreasing, and prices vis-\u00e0-vis competing Fiat products increased, Innocenti attempted to stay relevant by adding ever higher and more individual equipment. Innocenti kept building their own cars until early 1993. Beginning in 1990, when Fiat took over, Innocenti also sold Yugo's Koral and Brazilian-sourced versions of the Fiat Uno (Elba station wagon and Uno Mille) in the Italian market. The marque ended when sales of these rebadged models came to a halt in 1996.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Tchort was also the bass player in Emperor in the early 1990s and has been involved with bands like Carpathian Forest and Einherjer. The band soon got in touch with a drummer living in their hometown by the name of Freddy Bols\u00f8, and Blood Red Throne was born. Soon after bassist Erlend Caspersen joined the newly formed group. The band recorded a demo, entitled Deathmix 2000 with Ronni Thorsen from Trail of Tears providing the vocals. This demo got positive feedback and Blood Red Throne got offers from labels right away. \nFinally having recruited long-time friend Mr. Hustler as the permanent frontman, the same line-up recorded the debut Monument of Death and released it through Hammerheart Records in 2001. The limited edition included a package called 'The Suicide Kit', which not only contained the actual album, but also a printed razor blade and a poster. The kits were hand numbered in the band member's own blood. Blood Red Throne never did any live shows with this line up, Freddy Bols\u00f8 moved back to his hometown and the band had to find a new drummer.\nEspen \"Beist\" Antonsen of The Sickening joined and the band recorded Affiliated With The Suffering in 2002 and this was their last album through Hammerheart Records. The band did two European tours and the Inferno Fest with this lineup and Beist left as they were about to record their first album for Earache Records. With the help from Bernt Moen, Blood Red Throne managed to record their third album, Altered Genesis. That album was released in 2005 and after this release, Mr. Hustler had to leave the band due to work commitments and Vald was handed the microphone. To make things easier, Blood Red Throne also had to find a permanent and local drummer, and this led to the recruitment of Anders Haave. He joined the band in 2006 and Blood Red Throne went on a new European tour several live shows until going into the studio to record their fourth album, Come Death, for Earache Records.\nBlood Red Throne released their fifth album, Souls of Damnation, on June 1, 2009, through Earache Records.

More specifically, it has been characterized as an African creole and an African American religion.\nLouisiana Voodoo has also been referred to as New Orleans Voodoo, and\u2014in some older texts\u2014Voodooism. The scholar Ina J. Fandrich described it as the \"Afro-Creole counterculture religion of southern Louisiana\"; it describes a religion that emerged along the banks of the Mississippi River, and especially in the city of New Orleans.Several different spellings of Voodoo have been used; alternatives have included Voudou and Vaudou.\nThe spelling Voodoo is sometimes used for the Louisiana practice to distinguish it from Haitian Vodou.\nIn some sources, practitioners are referred to as Voodoos themselves, and elsewhere as Voodooists. A related term is hoodoo, which may originally have been largely synonymous with Voodoo. Over time, hoodoo came to describe \"the brand of African American supernaturalism found along the Mississippi\", entailing the use of charms and spells that made little reference to deities; in this it differs from the specific religion characterized by the term Voodoo.Louisiana Voodoo is a secretive religion; in 1972, for instance, the historian Blake Touchstone noted that Louisiana Voodoo was then largely being practiced outside the public eye. Among some contemporary practitioners there is a tradition not to speak to non-adherents about Voodoo. Louisiana Voodoo has not remained static, but has adapted and changed over time; in its original form, it probably survived into the early 20th century. In the late 20th century there was a revival of Louisiana Voodoo, creating a tradition that \"more closely resembles\" Haitian Vodou and Cuban Santer\u00eda than the 19th-century Louisiana Voodoo that is described in historical accounts. Some 21st-century practitioners have also sought instruction from West African traditions, for instance, being initiated into West African Vodun.Voodoo is a largely oral tradition. It has no formal creed, not a specific sacred text, and has no unifying organized structure or hierarchy. Practitioners will often adapt Voodoo to suit their specific requirements, in doing so often mixing it with other religious traditions. Throughout its history, many Voodoo practitioners have also practiced Roman Catholicism. While in the 21st century, Voodoo practitioners have for instance combined Voodoo with elements of Judaism and the Kabbalah, or with Hinduism.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Fieseler had been a manager for the Raab-Katzenstein, but when this company went bankrupt, Fieseler bought a sailplane factory in Kassel and quickly turned it to building sports planes.  At the same time, Fieseler still custom-built sailplanes for some of Germany's most prominent designers and pilots, including Wolf Hirth's \"Musterle\" and Robert Kronfeld's \"Wien\" and \"Austria\" (for many years the largest sailplane ever built).\nIn 1934, the company achieved prominence when Fieseler won the World Aerobatics Championship in an aircraft his company had built, the F2 Tiger.  This was followed by the highly successful F5, generally regarded as a classic among sports planes.  Even greater success was to follow in 1936 when an aircraft of Fieseler's own design won a tender over aircraft from both Messerschmitt and Siebel for a new STOL observation and liaison aircraft for the Luftwaffe.  It was designated the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch (Stork), and the company would produce over 3,000 during World War II. In 1937 Fieseler also produced the Fieseler Fi 253.\nOn April 1, 1939 the company name changed to the Gerhard Fieseler Werke GmbH.\nFieseler's other wartime production would largely consist of building other firms' aircraft under licence, including the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190.  In 1941 however, a Fieseler project for an unpiloted flying bomb (Fi 103) attracted the attention of the RLM (Reichsluftfahrtministerium - \"Reich Aviation Ministry\").

{"id": "740_882", "question": "Where was Was (Not Was) founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_14438", "text": "Unlike the majority of Rossetti's work of the 1850s, which were small-scale drawings and watercolours characterised by medieval and early Renaissance revivalism, Found was Rossetti's only attempt at a contemporary subject, prostitution, that was done in oils.Rossetti had addressed the topic of prostitution as early as 1847 in letters to his friend William Bell Scott, who wrote the poem Rosabell in 1846 (later known as Maryanne) on the topic. The Gate of Memory, a drawing Rossetti made c. 1854, shows a scene from Rosabell where a prostitute is beginning her evening of work, and views a group of innocent girls \"still at play\" dancing. The drawing may have been intended to illustrate the poem in a book, but was painted as a larger watercolour in 1857, which was repainted in 1864. In 1870 Rossetti published a sympathetic poem about a prostitute, Jenny.\n\nThe artist Alexander Munro's maid Ellen Frazer may have posed for an early head-study for the fallen country girl of Found, and an ink-and-wash study of the composition (now in the British Museum) is dated 1853. Rossetti began work on the painting in the autumn of 1854; this is probably the unfinished version now in Carlisle.On 30 September 1853 Rossetti wrote to his mother and sister describing the type of wall, cart and calf that he wished for them to find as models so that he could begin the painting. The unfinished Carlisle version consists only of these three elements, plus the head of Fanny Cornforth, apparently added later. Ford Madox Brown noted in his diary Rossetti's difficulties in painting the calf in November 1854, \"he paints it in all like Albert Durer (sic) hair by hair & seems incapable of any breadth ... From want of habit I see nature bothers him\u2014but it is sweetly drawn & felt.\"The calf's role in the painting is two-fold. First, it explains why the farmer has come to the city. But more importantly, its situation as \"an innocent animal trapped and on its way to be sold\" parallels the woman's and raises questions on the woman's state of mind. \"Is the prostitute rejecting salvation or is she accepting it; or is she repentant but unable to escape her fate, like the calf?\"In 1855, Rossetti described his work-in-progress in a letter to William Holman Hunt:\n\nI can tell you, on my own side, of only one picture fairly begun\u2014indeed, I may say, all things considered, rather advanced; but it is only a small one. The subject had been sometime designed before you left England and will be thought, by any one who sees it when (and if) finished, to follow in the wake of your \"Awakened Conscience,\" but not by yourself, as you know I had long had in view subjects taking the same direction as my present one. The picture represents a London street at dawn, with the lamps still lighted along a bridge which forms the distant background. A drover has left his cart standing in the middle of the road (in which, i. e. the cart, stands baa-ing a calf tied on its way to market), and has run a little way after a girl who has passed him, wandering in the streets. He has just come up with her and she, recognising him, has sunk under her shame upon her knees, against the wall of a raised churchyard in the foreground, while he stands holding her hands as he seized them, half in bewilderment and half guarding her from doing herself a hurt. These are the chief things in the picture which is to be called \"Found,\" and for which my sister Maria has found me a most lovely motto from Jeremiah ... The calf, a white one, will be a beautiful and suggestive part of the thing, though I am far from having painted him as well as I hoped to do.\nThe motto from Jeremiah 2:2 reads \"I remember Thee; the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy betrothal.\"  and appears on two early compositional studies. Rossetti replaced the word \"espousal\" in the motto as he found it with \"betrothal\", which he felt better translated the sense of the original Hebrew.In 1858, Rossetti met Fanny Cornforth, who soon became his mistress. She later described how he invited her to his studio and \"put my head against the wall and drew it for the head of the calf picture\". He made several pen and ink drawings about this time of the heads of both the male and female subjects.\nA version in oils was commissioned in 1859 by James Leathart, and this version, with the face of Fanny Cornforth, is the painting now in the Delaware Art Museum. Rossetti struggled with Found, abandoning and returning to it intermittently until at least 1881, and leaving it unfinished at his death. His assistants Henry Treffry Dunn and Frederic Shields both helped with the painting, and Dunn and Edward Burne-Jones may have worked on it after Rossetti's death.Rossetti published a poem, also titled \"Found\", as a companion to the painting in 1881 in the volume Ballads and Sonnets.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Fronted by chief songwriter and lead vocalist Sean Bonniwell, the band cultivated a characteristically dark and rebellious image reflected in an untamed musical approach. Sometimes it made use of distorted guitar lines and hallucinogenic organ parts, punctuated by Bonniwell's distinctively throaty vocals. Although they managed to attain national chart success only briefly with two singles, the Music Machine is today considered by many critics to be one of the groundbreaking acts of the 1960s. Their style is now recognized as a pioneering force in proto-punk; yet within a relatively short period of time, they began to employ more complex lyrical and instrumental arrangements that went beyond the typical garage band format.\nIn 1965, the band came together as a folk rock trio known as the Raggamuffins, before expanding to the quintet that was later rechristened the Music Machine. The group was known for their style of dress, clothing themselves in all-black attire. In 1966, the Music Machine was signed to Original Sound, and released its first single \"Talk Talk\" in the latter half of the year, with it reaching the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. Their debut album (Turn On) The Music Machine and the moderate hit \"The People in Me\" followed. The band's original lineup fragmented in late 1967 after managerial and financial disputes. Bonniwell reassembled the group under the name The Bonniwell Music Machine. In 1968, a second album, The Bonniwell Music Machine appeared, but the group disbanded in early 1969.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The Gate of Memory, a drawing Rossetti made c. 1854, shows a scene from Rosabell where a prostitute is beginning her evening of work, and views a group of innocent girls \"still at play\" dancing. The drawing may have been intended to illustrate the poem in a book, but was painted as a larger watercolour in 1857, which was repainted in 1864. In 1870 Rossetti published a sympathetic poem about a prostitute, Jenny.\n\nThe artist Alexander Munro's maid Ellen Frazer may have posed for an early head-study for the fallen country girl of Found, and an ink-and-wash study of the composition (now in the British Museum) is dated 1853. Rossetti began work on the painting in the autumn of 1854; this is probably the unfinished version now in Carlisle.On 30 September 1853 Rossetti wrote to his mother and sister describing the type of wall, cart and calf that he wished for them to find as models so that he could begin the painting. The unfinished Carlisle version consists only of these three elements, plus the head of Fanny Cornforth, apparently added later. Ford Madox Brown noted in his diary Rossetti's difficulties in painting the calf in November 1854, \"he paints it in all like Albert Durer (sic) hair by hair & seems incapable of any breadth ... From want of habit I see nature bothers him\u2014but it is sweetly drawn & felt.\"The calf's role in the painting is two-fold. First, it explains why the farmer has come to the city. But more importantly, its situation as \"an innocent animal trapped and on its way to be sold\" parallels the woman's and raises questions on the woman's state of mind. \"Is the prostitute rejecting salvation or is she accepting it; or is she repentant but unable to escape her fate, like the calf?\"In 1855, Rossetti described his work-in-progress in a letter to William Holman Hunt:\n\nI can tell you, on my own side, of only one picture fairly begun\u2014indeed, I may say, all things considered, rather advanced; but it is only a small one. The subject had been sometime designed before you left England and will be thought, by any one who sees it when (and if) finished, to follow in the wake of your \"Awakened Conscience,\" but not by yourself, as you know I had long had in view subjects taking the same direction as my present one. The picture represents a London street at dawn, with the lamps still lighted along a bridge which forms the distant background. A drover has left his cart standing in the middle of the road (in which, i. e. the cart, stands baa-ing a calf tied on its way to market), and has run a little way after a girl who has passed him, wandering in the streets. He has just come up with her and she, recognising him, has sunk under her shame upon her knees, against the wall of a raised churchyard in the foreground, while he stands holding her hands as he seized them, half in bewilderment and half guarding her from doing herself a hurt. These are the chief things in the picture which is to be called \"Found,\" and for which my sister Maria has found me a most lovely motto from Jeremiah ... The calf, a white one, will be a beautiful and suggestive part of the thing, though I am far from having painted him as well as I hoped to do.\nThe motto from Jeremiah 2:2 reads \"I remember Thee; the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy betrothal.\"  and appears on two early compositional studies. Rossetti replaced the word \"espousal\" in the motto as he found it with \"betrothal\", which he felt better translated the sense of the original Hebrew.In 1858, Rossetti met Fanny Cornforth, who soon became his mistress. She later described how he invited her to his studio and \"put my head against the wall and drew it for the head of the calf picture\". He made several pen and ink drawings about this time of the heads of both the male and female subjects.\nA version in oils was commissioned in 1859 by James Leathart, and this version, with the face of Fanny Cornforth, is the painting now in the Delaware Art Museum. Rossetti struggled with Found, abandoning and returning to it intermittently until at least 1881, and leaving it unfinished at his death. His assistants Henry Treffry Dunn and Frederic Shields both helped with the painting, and Dunn and Edward Burne-Jones may have worked on it after Rossetti's death.Rossetti published a poem, also titled \"Found\", as a companion to the painting in 1881 in the volume Ballads and Sonnets.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "740_925", "question": "Where was Tages founded?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_19356", "text": "Tages were a Swedish rock band formed in Gothenburg in 1963. The group, whose original line-up consisted of Tommy Blom, G\u00f6ran Lagerberg, Danne Larsson, Anders T\u00f6pel and Freddie Skantze, were one of the most successful Swedish bands of the 1960s. They achieved thirteen top-20 singles on Kv\u00e4llstoppen, such as \"Sleep Little Girl\", \"I Should Be Glad\", \"In My Dreams\", and \"Miss Mac Baren\", as well as having two albums certified gold, Tages (1965) and Tages 2 (1966).\nTages began their recording career as a beat band, heavily influenced and inspired by the Beatles. Initially, the group garnered much criticism from other musicians, who considered them inexperienced. This led to them quickly developing as a group, drawing influences from British mod artists, specifically Small Faces, and like them, were the center of Swedish male fashion from 1965 onward. The band would cover songs from virtually unknown artists in Sweden, such as John Lee Hooker, Willie Dixon and Muddy Waters, but also from competitors, such as the Everly Brothers, the Easybeats and Small Faces.\nBetween 1965 and 1967, Tages managed to record five studio albums, including Extra Extra (1966), which was among the first psychedelic rock albums recorded. During the later part of their career, Tages pioneered a genre of music, combining elements of Swedish folk music with contemporary rock music. In doing so, the group recorded their final studio album, simply titled Studio (1967), which solely contains original material and has often times been considered among the best Swedish albums of the 1960s. In mid-late 1968, Blom departed the band, after which they renamed themselves Blond. After a line-up change leaving Lagerberg the only original member left, they released one album, The Lilac Years, on the Fontana label in 1969.", "hasanswer": true}]}
