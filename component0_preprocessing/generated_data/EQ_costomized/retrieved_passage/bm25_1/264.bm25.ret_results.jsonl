Altogether, James Brown and the Famous Flames numerous R&B hit songs reached the Top 40 on the R&B and pop charts.They also appeared in the Hollywood films T.A.M.I. Show (1964) and Ski Party. Members of the Flames also contributed as songwriters and choreographers. In 2012 the Flames were retroactively inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside Brown. On their Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page, they are described as \"a group of singers, performers and dancers that created the complementary elements of one of the greatest stage shows of all time.\"\nAs of  2020, The Famous Flames were also inducted into The National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame.The Famous Flames are sometimes erroneously identified as James Brown's \"band\", a confusion partly fostered by their record companies' inconsistent labeling credit practices.

Puterbaugh states that it was a perfect record for \"reflecting off of fire escapes and terraces\" as \"it was #1 as the day dawned upon the new rock era\". Cornish states that the song gave the Young Rascals some slight newfound respect amongst underground hippie movements due to the more experimental, laxed nature of it. \"Groovin'\" also prompted the Young Rascals to change up their appearance, switching up their clothing for \"Nehru shirts, beards and beads\", along with prompting them to dropp the 'Young'-prefix from their named.The Young Rascals themselves were scheduled to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show twice owing to the success of \"Groovin'\", performing it live on June 4 and September 10, 1967 respectively.

Johnny Loftus of Allmusic stated that it \"really makes you miss the focused intensity of the band's salad days\", and that because of the stylistic improvisations of the band members' post-At the Drive-In projects The Mars Volta and Sparta \"it's easy to forget about At the Drive-In's capacity for convention. Their spectacular live show was a big part of their success. But as This Station Is Non-Operational continually points out, At the Drive-In wrote incredible songs, too.\" Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound gave the album a perfect score of 10 out of 10, remarking that it \"must be listened to with an absolutely open mind.

After some success with the singles \"You Are The Girl\" (a b-side to The Ethiopians' hit record \"Train to Skaville\") in 1966, he recruited his childhood friends David Webber and Errol Grandison in 1968 to form the original Gladiators vocal group. The group's name was allegedly suggested by a fellow bus passenger during the time of their first recordings.The group's first major success was with the single \"Hello Carol\" in 1968, for producer Coxsone Dodd, which topped the Jamaican music charts.  Shortly afterwards, in 1969, Webber was stricken with illness and was replaced by Clinton Fearon, one of Griffiths' proteges.  Similarly Grandison left the group in 1973 for family commitments and was replaced by Gallimore Sutherland.During the early 1970s the Gladiators cut numerous records for various producers such as, Lloyd Daley and Lee Perry, but it was their recordings for Dodd at Studio One that became the biggest hits.  During this time at Studio One the Gladiators' hits included \"Bongo Red\", \"Jah Jah Go Before Us\", \"Mr. Baldwin\", and \"Roots Natty\".The success of these recordings garnered the attention of Britain-based Virgin Records, who gave the group their first major recording contract in 1976.  Their debut album released on Virgin was the Tony Robinson produced Trenchtown Mix Up (1976), which included revisions of many of their early hits.  They followed this effort with Proverbial Reggae (1978). At the time Gladiators was a band with Albert Griffiths on lead guitar and vocals, Clinton Fearon on bass guitar and vocals, Gallimore Sutherland on rhythm guitar and vocals, Sly Dunbar on drums, Lloyd Parks on bass, Uziah \"Sticky\" Thompson on percussion, Ansel Collins on keyboards and Earl 'Wire' Lindo on synthesizer. Errol Thompson and Joe Gibbs were their engineer and mixer, and Robinson the record producer.\nDodd and Studio One also released Studio One Presenting the Gladiators, (1978) a compilation of some early Gladiators' records released 1968 \u2013 1974. The Gladiators' next two albums on Virgin were Naturality (1978) and Sweet So Till (1979). The group's next album Gladiators was recorded at Coach House Studios in the UK with local producer Eddy Grant.  It was the first Gladiators' album on which no member of the group played any of the instruments, as a few members of the band Aswad were brought in.  The album did worse than their previous work, and they were subsequently dropped from their contract with Virgin.  Virgin subsequently released two compilation albums Vital Selection in 1981 and Dreadlocks The Time Is Now in 1983.At the time, roots reggae was declining. A new type of reggae \u2013 based on drum machine, sampler, synthesizers and organ \u2013 occurred in the 1980s; ragga. One of the reasons for ragga's swift propagation is that it is generally easier, and less expensive to produce, than reggae performed on traditional musical instruments. Nevertheless, the Gladiators released eleven studio albums in the 1980s. They soon found a home at US-based Nighthawk Records and released Symbol of Reality in late 1982 followed by Serious Thing in 1984.  One year later the Gladiators changed labels again, this time moving to Heartbeat Records, where they released albums throughout the latter half of the decade.  In 1987 Fearon left the group after eighteen years, but Griffiths and Sutherland have continued to release albums on various labels since then.\nWith the advent of dancehall in the 1990s, the Gladiators only released three studio albums during that decade. Eventually, the Gladiators, Mighty Diamonds, Bunny Wailer, Heptones and Burning Spear had a renaissance.

Half of it is about my ex-fianc\u00e9 who meant everything to me, so once Motograter had fell apart and then her and I dwindled apart it just took a huge part of my life.

Jim Farber from Daily News noted that Ricky Martin \"provides a textbook example of how to mix Latin beats with pop tunes and rock intonations\". Lucas Villa from Spin wrote about Martin's global success in 1999: \"When the world went loca for Ricky, he led the way for other Latin music superstars like Spain's Enrique Iglesias, Colombia's Shakira and Nuyoricans like Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony to make their marks beyond the Spanish-speaking crowds.\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch critic Kevin C. Johnson described Martin as Latin music's \"pretty-faced poster boy\" who is \"taking the music to places Jon Secada, Selena and Santana never could\".

While avoiding mention of the official song titles, he highlighted Lennon's \"The Void\" for its electronic effects, along with a \"McCartney song about lonely people\" set to string orchestration, and a \"Harrison number on which he plays a long exotic solo on sitar\". In Britain, EMI gradually distributed the album's songs to radio stations throughout July \u2013 a strategy that MacDonald describes as \"building anticipation for what would clearly be a radical new phase in the group's recording career\". Revolver was released there on 5 August and on 8 August in the United States. \"Eleanor Rigby\" was issued as a double A-side single with \"Yellow Submarine\". The pairing of a ballad devoid of any instrumentation played by a Beatle and a novelty song marked a significant departure from the usual content of the band's singles.Schaffner likens the Beatles' 1966 recordings to the moment of transformation in the film The Wizard of Oz, \"where, when Dorothy discovers herself transported from Kansas to Oz, the film dramatically changes from black-and-white to glorious technicolor\". The album appeared a year before psychedelic drugs became a phenomenon in youth culture, and it was the source of confusion for the group's more conservative fans. A female writer later complained in Beatles Monthly that 1966 represented the end of \"The Beatles we used to know before they went stark, raving mad\". In this way, Revolver marked the start of a change in the Beatles' core audience, as their young, female-dominated fanbase gave way to a following that increasingly comprised more serious-minded, male listeners.The release coincided with a period of public relations challenges for the band, the combination of which led to their decision to retire from touring following the end of their North American tour, on 29 August. In the US, the album's release was a secondary event to the controversy surrounding the recent publication there of Cleave's interview with Lennon, in which he remarked that the Beatles had become \"more popular than Jesus\". This episode followed the unfavourable reaction to the Yesterday and Today butcher sleeve, from the press, radio stations and retail outlets. As a result, at press conferences during the tour, questions were typically focused on religious matters rather than the band's new music. In addition, the group were vocal in their opposition to the Vietnam War, a stand that further redefined their public image in the US. The Beatles did not attempt to perform any of the songs from Revolver during the tour.Reporting on \"Swinging London\" for The Village Voice, Richard Goldstein said that, as if in response to the antagonism being shown towards the band in the US, \"British youth has flipped completely over the new Beatle album, Revolver.\" Author Howard Sounes writes that, amid the fine weather of the 1966 summer and England's recent win in the World Cup, Revolver was the nation's \"soundtrack album of the season\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

The 2001 follow up, 'On The Enjoyment of Unpleasant Places', achieved a similar status on its release through the legendary English label Subjugation Records. Initial pressings of the record sold very quickly and, indeed, it remained out of print until a repackaged version (including the Icy You EP) was released in 2004. 2002 saw the release of two EPs by Stapleton; firstly, the 'Icy You' EP, made up of songs from the 'On The Enjoyment' sessions, and secondly, the 'Chez Chef' EP, recorded in London by Pat Collier and Larry Hibbitt. Stapleton toured prolifically around this time, supporting high-profile peers such as Idlewild, Snow Patrol and Hundred Reasons, as well as highly regarded independent touring bands like Lungfish, Weakerthans, Q and not U, Pedro The Lion, Tristeza and Burning Airlines.

His voice reached the register of a countertenor.Following a year and a half of Top 40 non-entries on Billboard's Hot 100, the duo hit big with the late-1964 release of what would become their signature record, \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" \u2013 a transatlantic number one produced by Phil Spector, often considered one of his finest works and a landmark recording in popular music.

There was a period of indecision about what song would be released as the first single; the label wanted to get everything right for the campaign, because the all-girl group format was untested. The group, led by Brown and Halliwell, was adamant that the debut song should be \"Wannabe\", they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and the Girl Power statement. Virgin's executives believed that the first single should either be \"Say You'll Be There\", which they considered a much \"cooler\" track, or \"Love Thing\". At the beginning of 1996 the impasse between the group and their record label about the release of the single was temporarily solved. In March, Fuller announced that he agreed with Virgin in that \"Wannabe\" should not be the first single. The label wanted a song that appealed to the mainstream market, and nothing considered too radical. Halliwell was shocked and furious; she told Fuller, \"It's not negotiable as far as we're concerned. 'Wannabe' is our first single.\" Fuller and the executives at Virgin relented, and the song was chosen as their first single.The trigger for the Spice Girls' launch was the release of the \"Wannabe\" music video in May 1996. Its quick success on the British cable network The Box sparked press interest, despite initial resistance to the all-girl group idea. The same month, their first music press interviews appeared in Music Week, Top of the Pops, and Smash Hits, and their first live TV slot was broadcast on LWT's Surprise Surprise. A month after the video's release, the song was receiving intensive airplay on the main radio stations across the UK, while the group started to appear on television\u2014mainly on kid's programmes such as Live & Kicking\u2014and doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines. A full-page advertisement appeared in the July issue of Smash Hits, saying: \"Wanted: Anyone with a sense of fun, freedom and adventure. Hold tight, get ready! Girl Power is comin' at you\". The group appeared on the television programme This Morning with Richard and Judy, and performed at their first Radio One road show in Birmingham.\"Wannabe\" was first released in Japan on 26 June 1996 as a maxi CD. In the United Kingdom, the song was issued on 8 July 1996 in two single versions. The first one, released in two formats\u2014a standard CD single and a cassette single\u2014include the radio edit of the track, the Motiv 8 vocal slam remix, and the B-side, \"Bumper to Bumper\". The group wrote \"Bumper to Bumper\" with Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins\u2014the songwriter-production duo known as Absolute\u2014and British singer-songwriter Cathy Dennis. The second version, released on maxi single format on 15 July, feature the radio edit, an instrumental version, the Motiv 8 dub slam remix, and the Dave Way alternative mix. This version came with a fold-out postcard inlay and a stickered case.During the weeks following the UK release, the group began promotional visits abroad. They did three trips to Japan and brief visits to Germany and the Netherlands. On a trip to the Far East, they visited Hong Kong, Thailand, and South Korea. In January 1997 they travelled to North America to do a promotional campaign that Phil Quartararo, president of Virgin Records America, described as \"absolutely massive\". In Canada, the group did interviews for newspapers and radio stations, appeared in television programmes such as Hit List, and MusiquePlus, and attended an autograph signing at Montreal's HMV Megastore. During their visit to the US, the group met with influential radio programmers, TV networks, and magazines. In addition, the music video was placed into heavy rotation by MTV.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Eccles had an itinerant childhood due to his father's need to travel Jamaica seeking work. He used to regularly attend church, and he became influenced by spiritual singing; In his words: \"One of my uncles was a spiritual revivalist, who always did this heavy type of spiritual singing, and I got to love that\". Eccles's professional singing career began as a teenager, working the north-coast hotel circuit in the mid-1950s.  In his late teens, he moved to Ocho Rios, where he performed at night in various shows, with artists such as The Blues Busters, Higgs & Wilson and Buster Brown. He moved to Kingston in 1959, where he started his recording career. He first recorded for Coxsone Dodd, who had organised a talent show in which Eccles took part.Eccles had a Jamaican hit in 1961 with the early ska song \"Freedom\", which was recorded in 1959, and was featured on Dodd's sound system for two years before it was released. It was one of the first Jamaican songs with socially oriented lyrics. The song discussed the concept of repatriation to Africa, an idea developed by the growing Rastafari movement. The song became the first Jamaican hit to be used for political purposes; Alexander Bustamante, founder of the Jamaican Labour Party and at that time Chief Minister of Jamaica adopted it for his fight against the Federation of the West Indies in 1960. In the following years, Eccles had other successful songs, mixing boogie/rhythm and blues influences with ska rhythms, such as \"River Jordan\" and \"Glory Hallelujah\".\nIn 1962, he started promoting concerts and set up his Christmas Morning talent show; first with Dodd, then on his own. He organised concerts for The Clarendonians in 1963, and for The Wailers in 1964 and 1965. He launched other talent search contests, with Battle of the Stars, Clancy Eccles Revue, Independent Revue and Reggae Soul Revue, from which emerged stars such as Barrington Levy and Culture.\nStarting in 1963, he recorded with producers such as Charlie Moo (Leslie Kong's business partner) and the husband of Sonia Pottinger, Lyndon. He couldn't make a living from his music, so he quit in 1965 to work as a tailor in Annotto Bay. During this period, he made stage outfits for musicians such as Kes Chin, The Mighty Vikings, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, Carlos Malcolm and The Blues Busters.He went back to music in 1967, producing his own recordings as well as those of other artists. He scored a hit with Eric 'Monty' Morris' reggae song \"Say What You're Saying\", and with his own song \"Feel The Rhythm\", one of several records that were instrumental in the shift from rocksteady to reggae. Eccles has also been credited with deriving the name 'reggae' from streggae', Kingston slang for a good-time girl. Eccles' first hit, \"What Will Your Mama Say\" which was released by the recently created United Kingdom label, Pama Records. In 1968, his song \"Fattie Fattie\" became a skinhead reggae classic, along with his productions of recordings by the toasting DJ King Stitt (\"Fire Corner\", \"Van Cleef\", \"Herbman Shuffle\"). Eccles recorded many organ-led instrumentals with his session band The Dynamites (same band has Derrick Harriott's Crystalites), featuring Jackie Jackson, Hux Brown, Paul Douglas, Winston Wright, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Grennan, Joe Isaacs, and Hugh Malcolm, with Johnny Moore and Bobby Ellis both contributing trumpet in different sessions. In 1970, Eccles helped pave the way to the dub music genre by releasing an instrumental version of \"Herbman Shuffle\" called \"Phantom\", with a mix focusing on the bass line.\nEccles launched different record labels for his works: Clansone, New Beat and Clandisc (the latter also the name of a sub-label set up by Trojan Records for Eccles' UK releases). He recorded artists such as Alton Ellis, Joe Higgs, the Trinidian Lord Creator (\"Kingston Town\"), Larry Marshall, Hemsley Morris, Earl Lawrence, The Beltones, Glen Ricks, Cynthia Richards, Buster Brown and Beres Hammond. Appreciated by musicians for his fairness and sense of equity, he helped Lee Perry set up his Upsetter record label in 1968 after Perry left Dodd's employment, and helped Winston 'Niney' Holmes (later known as 'The Observer') record his first hit as a producer in 1971 (\"Blood & Fire\").A socialist militant, Eccles was appointed as an adviser on the music industry to Michael Manley's People's National Party (PNP) and took part in Jamaica's 1972 prime ministerial elections by organising a \"Bandwagon\" featuring musicians such as Bob Marley & the Wailers, Dennis Brown, Max Romeo, Delroy Wilson and Inner Circle, performing around the island in support of Manley's campaign. Throughout the 1970s, he remained close to Manley and wrote several songs in praise of the PNP program, including his hits \"Power for the People\", \"Rod of Correction\" or \"Generation Belly\".\nEccles' political interests meant that he spent less time on music, although in the late 1970s, Eccles had further success as a producer with recordings by Tito Simon and Exuma the Obeah Man, as well as collaborations with King Tubby. After the 1970s, new Eccles recordings were rare, and he concentrated on live concert promotion and re-issues of his back catalogue. In the 1980s, Eccles slowed down his musical activities, and he never met success again, apart from a few political songs, such as \"Dem Mash Up The Country\" in 1985. Eccles died on 30 June 2005, in Spanish Town Hospital from complications of a heart attack.\nEccles' son, Clancy Eccles Jr., has followed his father into the music business, initially performing as simply \"Clancy\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was commissioned by Catherine Lescuyer as a commemorative piece for her father. Rubens created it as part of an altarpiece in the Church of St. Rombout (Rumbold) in Mechelen. The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas dressed in blue turning back towards the viewer and away from the table. Other than Jesus, the most prominent figure is Judas. Judas holds his right hand to his mouth with his eyes avoiding direct contact with the other figures in the painting creating a nervous expression. Jesus is dressed in red and has a yellow halo surrounding his head with his face tilted upwards. Jesus is located centrally in the painting surrounded by his disciples with six on each side, and he holds a loaf of bread with a cup of wine in front of him. Out of all of the figures, he is the most in the light with the figures to the farthest left being the most in shadow. \u201cThe scene thus represents a perfect conflation of the theological significance of the Last Supper\u201d meaning the conflation between the blessing of the bread and the wine while still being pivotal in the sense of revealing the betrayal.As in many other Northern European depictions, a dog with a bone can be seen in the scene, probably a simple pet. It may represent  faith, dogs are traditionally symbols of and are representing faith. According to J. Richard Judson the dog near Judas perhaps represents greed or evil, as the companion of Judas, as in John 13:27.This painting followed the first unsuccessful attempt by Rubens to produce a Last Supper in 1611, when his patrons backed out the last minute, perhaps due to the high price of 4,000 Guilder asked by Rubens.Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper fresco was a significant influence on Rubens who created an etching after the Davinci Last Supper, which was one of Rubens' first attempts to express the full range of human emotion printed by Pieter Soutman. Rubens was also influenced by his humanist ideals from which he extracts biblical themes.Rubens often made engravings following the completion of his works. Other artists used these engravings to serve as a basis of their own works. These copies were even collected. The engravings and copies helped to lead to the popularity of Rubens\u2019 works during his lifetime.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream critics, the album received a metascore of 64, based on 7 reviews.The album has garnered positive reviews from AbsolutePunk, American Songwriter, The Boston Globe, Entertainment Weekly, Roughstock, Taste of Country, and the USA Today. At AbsolutePunk, Gregory Robson gave the album an 80%, and wrote that \"Kenny Chesney's fifteenth studio album is nowhere near his best and nowhere near his worst. What it is though is occasionally pleasing, horribly derivative and way too self-indulgent.\" Robson went on to state that \"Welcome to the Fishbowl is anything but first-rate. More albums like this though, and Chesney himself just might become a caricature of himself.\" Grady Smith at Entertainment Weekly graded the album to be a B\u2212 effort, and added that \"Chesney's albums have always been considerably more wistful than his radio persona, but Welcome to the Fishbowl's tunes, while well wrought, can be downright dour. The tonal shift is fine \u2014 the problem is that these weepies often come off less like authentic autobiography than downbeat Nashville role-playing. (The too-sleek production and ponderous, stretched-out tempos don't help.)\" In addition, Smith wrote that \"Fishbowl reveals less about the star's true interior life than ever.\"The album received four-out-of-five stars from American Songwriter, Roughstock and Taste of Country. American Songwriter music critic Eric Allen noted that \"Fishbowl displays a serious yearning to stretch and dig a little deeper into life\u2019s foibles, as if Chesney is trying to figure them out himself, but in a good way.\" Furthermore, Allen evoked how \"Welcome to the Fishbowl still manages to sound highly personal and introspective. Chesney has an uncanny knack for finding top-shelf material which sounds autobiographical and mixing it with his own to craft a uniquely distinguishable musical statement.\" Matt Bjorke of Roughstock alluded to how \"Welcome To The Fishbowl should easily join Kenny Chesney's past albums as #1-selling country records and there's no doubt that it's also amongst the best in his career, a career that is as strong now as it was promising 20 years ago\".

Jerry Shirver of the USA Today rated the album a two and a half out of four stars, and said that \"Though the arrangements of these dozen tunes are up to date and his voice retains that bland average-Joe quality that the masses and radio programmers adore, most of the themes are calculated standard issue.\"However, the album received mixed reviews from About.com, Allmusic, BBC Music, Country Weekly, Omaha World-Herald and the Rolling Stone. The worst review for the album came in from Jessica Nicholson of Country Weekly, who based on Metacritic assigned score rated the album a two and a half out of five stars, pointed to how \"the album\u2019s bound to leave some fans hoping Kenny will book another trip to the islands with his trusty acoustic and a cold drink, if only to find a balance between his previously lighthearted fare and the brooding material that abounds on this effort.\" Moreover, Nicholson vowed that \"the superstar delves headlong into melancholy.\"The three out of five star reviews were from About.com, Allmusic, BBC Music, which is based on the Metacritic assigned score, and the Rolling Stone. To this, Robert Silva of About.com highlighted that \"While fans of the more upbeat Chesney may complain, Welcome to the Fishbowl shows Chesney continuing to evolve in ways that are encouraging.\" Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine alluded to how \"this is a far cheerier affair\" that \"the cheeky title suggests\". In closing, Erlewine stated that \"Wedded to this warmth is a crisp clean sheen, a sound so bright that it threatens to get goofy when Chesney and crew rock out \u2013 they're no longer as urgent as they were even five years earlier, which gives the gurgling swing of the title track a stiff white-boy funkiness that isn't necessarily alienating \u2013 but such chipper charm permeates the entirety of Welcome to the Fishbowl, turning it into an everyday feel-good record, the kind that generates moments of warmth when heard fleetingly on the radio, at the grocery store, in a doctor's office, at work, or even at home.\" Leonie Cooper of BBC Music evoked how the album is \"aimed squarely at the mainstream.\" The Rolling Stone music critic Chuck Eddy called this a \"Fairly depressive, in total \u2013 but these days, Chesney sounds more convincing when he's less upbeat.\" At Omaha World-Herald, Kevin Coffey noted how the album \"has the party vibe some Chesney fans will be looking for, but a closer look at the lyrics reveals it\u2019s a rant against paparazzi, celebrities and a culture that glorifies everyone\u2019s 15 minutes of fame.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

After his return he started a band with bassist Tommy Baker and drummer Carl Frye, who began playing the local Arkansas circuits. In 1966, the group traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, and recorded a single, \"My Girl Josephine\" (a hit for Fats Domino the previous decade). The single was initially released in a press run of 500; Jaye shopped the disc to local radio stations, and as the tune began getting airplay, Jaye signed a contract with Hi Records for national distribution. Re-released in 1967, \"My Girl Josephine\" became a hit single in the US, peaking at No. 29 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. A full-length LP, My Girl Josephine, followed, which hit No. 195 in the US, but four further singles from the album failed to make an impact on the charts. During this time Jaye toured with Booker T and the MGs and Lou Rawls among others.\nJaye left Hi Records in 1970 and began recording new material for Nashville's Mega/Raintree. Seven singles were released, some of which found regional success. Between 1974 and 1975 he sang lead with the Bill Black Combo after its founder's death. In 1975, Jaye signed with Columbia Records, first releasing a cover of Tommy Edwards's \"It's All in the Game\". This was followed by two further US Country hits (again with Hi Records) in 1976, \"Honky Tonk Women Love Redneck Men\" (US Country No. 32) and \"Hot and Still Heatin' (US Country No. 78). In 1979 he left Hi again, and began touring the American South with his wife Darlene Battles. Together they released an album on Bejay Records[1] in 1984. Jaye toured Sweden and England in the 1990s, and released another album, One More Time, in 2005.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

In 2005, Pitchfork wrote that it had \"challenged and confounded\" Radiohead's audience, and subsequently \"transformed into an intellectual symbol of sorts ... Owning it became 'getting it'; getting it became 'anointing it'.\" In 2015, Sheffield likened Radiohead's change in style to Bob Dylan's controversial move to rock music, writing that critics now hesitated to say they had disliked it at the time. He described Kid A as the \"defining moment in the Radiohead legend\". A year later, Billboard argued that Kid A was the first album since Bowie's Low to have moved \"rock and electronic music forward in such a mature fashion\". In an article for Kid A's 20th anniversary, the Quietus suggested that the negative reviews had been motivated by rockism, the tendency among music critics to venerate rock music over other genres.In a 2011 Guardian article about his critical Melody Maker review, Beaumont wrote that though his opinion had not changed, \"Kid A's status as a cultural cornerstone has proved me, if not wrong, then very much in the minority ... People whose opinions I trust claim it to be their favourite album ever.\" In 2014, Brice Ezell of PopMatters wrote that Kid A is \"more fun to think and write about than it is to actually listen to\" and a \"far less compelling representation of the band's talents than The Bends and OK Computer\". In 2016, Dorian Lynskey wrote in The Guardian: \"At times, Kid A is dull enough to make you fervently wish that they'd merged the highlights with the best bits of the similarly spotty Amnesiac ... Yorke had given up on coherent lyrics so one can only guess at what he was worrying about.\"Grantland credited Kid A for pioneering the use of internet to stream and promote music, writing: \"For many music fans of a certain age and persuasion, Kid A was the first album experienced primarily via the internet \u2013 it's where you went to hear it, read the reviews, and argue about whether it was a masterpiece ... Listen early, form an opinion quickly, state it publicly, and move on to the next big record by the official release date. In that way, Kid A invented modern music culture as we know it.\" In his 2005 book Killing Yourself to Live, critic Chuck Klosterman interpreted Kid A as a prediction of the September 11 attacks.Speaking at Radiohead's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2019, David Byrne of Talking Heads, one of Radiohead's formative influences, said: \"What was really weird and very encouraging was that [Kid A] was popular. It was a hit!

Rock critic Mikal Gilmore said, \"Led Zeppelin\u2014talented, complex, grasping, beautiful and dangerous\u2014made one of the most enduring bodies of composition and performance in twentieth-century music, despite everything they had to overpower, including themselves\".Led Zeppelin have influenced hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush, Queen, Scorpions, Aerosmith, the Black Crowes, and Megadeth as well as progressive metal bands like Tool and Dream Theater. They influenced some early punk and post-punk bands, among them the Ramones, Joy Division and the Cult. They were also an important influence on the development of alternative rock, as bands adapted elements from the \"Zeppelin sound\" of the mid-1970s, including the Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Bands and artists from diverse genres have acknowledged the influence of Led Zeppelin, such as Madonna, Shakira, Lady Gaga, Kesha, and Katie Melua.\nLed Zeppelin have been credited with a major impact on the nature of the music business, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock. In 1988 John Kalodner, then-A&R executive of Geffen Records, remarked that\n\nIn my opinion, next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They're the ones who did the first real big arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can do as well as them, but nobody surpasses them.\nAndrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, commented on how Led Zeppelin had a major influence on the record business, and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences. In 2007, they were a featured artist in the stadium rock episode of the BBC/VH1 series Seven Ages of Rock.The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide according to some sources, while others state that they have sold in excess of 300 million records, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Led Zeppelin are the third-highest-selling band, the fifth highest selling music act in the US, and one of only four acts to earn five or more Diamond albums. They achieved eight consecutive number-ones on the UK Albums Chart, a record for most consecutive UK number-one albums shared with ABBA. Led Zeppelin remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music.Led Zeppelin also made a significant cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, argues that \"on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement\". Led Zeppelin have also been described as \"the quintessential purveyors\" of masculine and aggressive \"cock rock\", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that \"Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people want a piece of that\".

Asserting that their \"industrial paganism\" was different from most forms of contemporary paganism, Partridge described it as \"confrontational, subversive, experimental and, to a large extent, dystopian\", with it serving as \"an ideological tool\" with which to analyse society \"from its underbelly; an immersion in the dark side; the subversion of Christian hegemony, conservative politics and what nowadays might be described as neoliberalism\". P-Orridge was devoted to the deity Eshu Eleggu\u00e1, an entity from the Afro-Caribbean syncretic religion of Santer\u00eda. P-Orridge also stated disbelief in the literal existence of gods, deeming such entities to instead be \"early attempts at psychology, trying to understand the light and dark side of human nature\".P-Orridge vociferously criticised contemporary Christianity, describing it as \"an incredibly sick social pseudo-religion\", and arguing that it was based upon the tenet of \"Be good now, agree, or else we will punish you forever and ever when you're dead. And we may punish you while you're alive ...\"  P-Orridge maintained that such an attitude was established in Christianity by St. Paul and the early Roman Catholic Church, and that it differed from the \"ecstatic mysticism of the original Christianity, the Gnostic Christianity\".In her memoir, Art Sex Music, former bandmate Cosey Fanni Tutti claimed P-Orridge had been abusive during their relationship.

It received favorable reviews, but sold poorly, reaching number 151 on the US record charts during a four-week stay and becoming the lowest-charting Beach Boys album to that point. \"Add Some Music to Your Day\" was the only single that charted in the US, peaking at number 64. In the UK, the album peaked at number 29.\nWorking titles for the album included Reverberation, Add Some Music, and The Fading Rock Group Revival. The recording sessions began in January 1969, and, after a year-long search for a new record contract, completed in July 1970. In contrast to 20/20, the record featured a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members. About four dozen songs were written for the album, and the label rejected numerous revisions of its track listing before the band presented enough formidable material deemed satisfactory for release. It includes \"This Whole World\", one of Brian Wilson's most complex songs, \"Forever\", regarded as among Dennis Wilson's finest, and \"Cool, Cool Water\", a song that originated from the band's Smile sessions.\n\nFans generally consider Sunflower to be the Beach Boys' finest post-Pet Sounds album. It has appeared in several critics' and listeners' polls for the best albums of all time, including Rolling Stone's 2003 list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The track \"All I Wanna Do\" was later cited as one of the earliest examples of dream pop and chillwave.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine deemed it the point where she \"truly became 'Madonna the superstar'\u2014the endlessly ambitious, fearlessly provocative entertainer that knew how to outrage, spark debates, get good reviews\u2014and make good music while she's at it\". From the BBC, Mark Savage wrote that it established her as \"the first lady of pop\", an opinion that was shared by Peter Piatkowski, who added that it made her the \"dominant face on the Mount Rushmore of 1980s pop\", along with Michael Jackson, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen. In a similar note, Sal Cinquemani said that with True Blue, Madonna joined the ranks of Jackson and Prince and made the transition from \"pop tart to consummate artist\". According to Lucy O'Brien, \"with its sophisticated sheen, [True Blue] took Madonna firmly out of the dance-diva category into a global pop market\". To Matthew Rettenmund, author of Encyclopedia Madonnica, it was the first \"solid proof\" of her artistic and musical talents. Patrick Leonard himself explained: \"The music got more serious, so I think she got taken more seriously [...] [Madonna] took some chances that I don\u2019t know most people would have. There were things [in True Blue] that weren\u2019t normal in pop music at the time\".\n\nSlant Magazine considered True Blue one of the best albums from the 1980s; Jonathan Keefe wrote that it marked the point where \"it became readily apparent that Madonna was more than just a flash-in-the-pan pop star. It's when she began manipulating her image \u2014and her audience\u2014 with a real sense of clarity and purpose\". Piatkowski wrote that it \"set the stage for the exponential ascent of Madonna's brilliance\", that began with 1989's Like a Prayer and reached its peak on 1998's Ray of Light. From music portal Albumism, Justin Chadwick conlcuded that, \"[True Blue] solidified [Madonna's] blonde ambition, cemented her worldwide superstardom, and, once and for all, extinguished any remaining doubts about her potential career longevity\". The album also helped popularize marketing singles, according to Billboard's Paul Grein: \"10 or 20 years ago you would have had two singles from an album at the most. Now we\u2019re in an era where Madonna is on her fifth [from True Blue]\".True Blue was 1986's best-selling album, and the best-selling of the 1980s decade by a female artist, with Madonna being 1986's most successful female. The album held the record for being number one in a total of 28 countries around the world. With over 17 million copies sold, it was named the highest-seller of all time by a female in the 1991 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records; True Blue has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide, and is one of the best-selling albums of all time.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His father worked as a truck driver and also played trumpet and sang in local bands. Freddy grew up listening to the rhythm and blues music of Big Joe Turner, Buddy Johnson and others on the radio, and he learned to play guitar.  After attending Lynn Vocation High School, he made his recording debut as a singer in 1958, singing and playing rhythm guitar on a single, \"Cha-Cha-Do\" by the Spindrifts, which became a local hit.  He had also played lead guitar on a session for an R&B vocal group, the G-Clefs, whose record \"Ka-Ding Dong\" made No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1956. At a young age he joined the National Guard, took a job driving a truck, married, and became a father.Inspired musically by Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little Richard, he formed his own group, Freddy Karmon & the Hurricanes, which became increasingly popular in the Boston area, and began to develop a trademark strained singing style.  He also became a regular on a local TV dance show, Boston Ballroom, and, in 1958, signed up to a management contract with Boston disc jockey Jack McDermott.  With lyrics written by his mother, he prepared a new song which he called \"Rock and Roll Baby\", and he produced a demo which McDermott took to the writing and production team of Bob Crewe and Frank Slay.  They rearranged the song, rewrote the lyrics, and offered to produce a recording in return for two-thirds of the composing credits. The first recording of the song, now titled \"Tallahassee Lassie\", with a guitar solo by session musician Kenny Paulson, was rejected by several record companies, but was then heard by TV presenter Dick Clark who part-owned Swan Records in Philadelphia. \nClark suggested that the song be re-edited and overdubbed to add excitement, by highlighting the pounding bass drum sound and adding hand claps and Freddy's cries of \"whoo!\", which later became one of his trademarks. The single was finally released by Swan Records, with the company president, Bernie Binnick, suggesting Freddy's new stage name of \"Freddy Cannon\". After being promoted and becoming successful in Boston and Philadelphia, the single gradually received national airplay.  In 1959, it peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first of his 22 songs to appear on the Billboard chart, and also reached No. 13 on the R&B singles chart. In the UK, where his early records were issued on the Top Rank label, it reached No. 17. \"Tallahassee Lassie\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.\nHe stayed on the Swan label with producer Frank Slay for the next five years and became known as Freddy \"Boom Boom\" Cannon for the thumping power of his recordings. Dick Clark brought him national exposure through his numerous appearances on his television program, American Bandstand - a record of 110 appearances in total.  In the words of writer Cub Koda:\"Freddy Cannon was a true believer, a rocker to the bone. Freddy Cannon made rock & roll records; great noisy rock & roll records, and all of them were infused with a gigantic drum beat that was an automatic invitation to shake it on down anyplace there was a spot to dance.\"\nHis second single \"Okefenokee\" (credited to Freddie Cannon, as were several of his other records) only made No. 43 on the charts, but the next record, \"Way Down Yonder In New Orleans\", a rocked-up version of a 1922 song, became a gold record and reached No. 3 in the pop charts in both the US and the UK, where it was the biggest of his hits. It also sold over one million copies.  Cannon toured in Britain and, in March 1960, his album The Explosive Freddy Cannon became the first album by a rock and roll singer to top the UK Albums Chart. For the next two years, until early 1962, he continued to have lesser chart hits in the US, in some cases with versions of old standards including \"Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy\" and Edward \"Kid\" Ory's \"Muskrat Ramble\".  His hits also included \"Twistin' All Night Long\", recorded with Danny & the Juniors and also featuring Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons on backing vocals. However, one of his biggest hits came in May 1962 with \"Palisades Park\", written by future TV Gong Show host Chuck Barris. Produced by Slay with overdubbed rollercoaster sound effects, it reached No. 3 on the Hot 100, No. 15 on the R&B chart, and No. 20 in the UK. This release also sold over one million copies, gaining gold disc status.Cannon also appeared with Bobby Vee, Johnny Tillotson and others, in the movie Just for Fun, made in the UK in 1962.  Although his popularity in the US faded, he remained a popular touring act in Britain and elsewhere in the world for some years.  In 1963, he signed for Warner Bros. Records where he recorded his last two US top twenty hits, \"Abigail Beecher\" (No. 16) in 1964 and the following year \"Action\" (No. 13), from Dick Clark's TV show Where the Action Is, which he recorded with top Los Angeles session musicians including Leon Russell, James Burton, Glen Campbell, and David Gates. \"Action\" got a fourth gold disc for Cannon. Also in 1965, Slay acquired Cannon's Swan recordings and sold them to Warner Bros.\nHe appeared, along with the Beau Brummels, in Village of the Giants, a teen movie with early film appearances by Beau Bridges and Ron Howard, and played himself, performing one of his songs, in the final episode of the teen soap opera, Never Too Young, on 24 June 1966. \nAfter leaving Warner Bros. Records in 1967, Cannon released singles on several labels, including Sire, Royal American, Metromedia, MCA, Andee, Claridge, Horn, and Amherst. In the 1970s he recorded and became a promotional man for Buddah Records, but returned to the lower reaches of the charts in 1981 with \"Let's Put the Fun Back in Rock'n'Roll,\" recorded with the Belmonts for MiaSound Records and in 1982 appeared in the independent movie, The Junkman.  Thereafter, he continued to work with Dick Clark at his Bandstand reunion concerts and to tour all over the world.  In 2002, he released an album of seasonal songs, Have A Boom Boom Christmas!!A resident of Tarzana, California, Cannon continues to put on performances at assorted concert venues. He has complete control and ownership of his Swan and Warner Bros. masters.One notable fan of Cannon's was the late Box Tops and Big Star singer Alex Chilton; Chilton reportedly had a portrait of Cannon hanging on the wall of his home in New Orleans and had once offered the following comment about Cannon to a friend: \"Freddy Cannon\u2019s shows always worked, because he moved through life with ease.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The album was credited on the front cover to \"Dean Elliott and His Swinging Big, Big Band\" and on the LP label to \"Dean Elliott and His Orchestra\".  The album was made with the assistance of Phil Kaye, a sound effects virtuoso who worked with Elliott on the Tom and Jerry cartoons.[1]\nThe subtitle that appeared on the front cover of the LP (which also featured three young women striking arguably sultry poses with saxophones and congas atop a cement truck) captured the basic goals, sound, and feel of the album quite well:\n\nA Sonic Spectacular Presenting MUSIC! MUSIC! MUSIC! With these special Percussion Effects!

A track from the album (\"Will You Still Be Mine\") was later anthologized on one of Rhino Records' influential Cocktail Mix CDs.  As the space age pop/lounge revival grew in popularity, two more tracks from the album (\"You're the Top\" and \"The Lonesome Road\") were anthologized on one of the many volumes of Capitol Records' Ultra-Lounge series.The album was out of print for decades and wasn\u2019t officially available on CD until 2001, when Dutch label Basta Music [2], known for their reissues of Raymond Scott material, released what was described as an official, legitimate CD release of Zounds! transferred directly from the Capitol master tapes.[3].

{"id": "264_285", "question": "What music label is The Family That Plays Together represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27485", "text": "Various readings of what the situation in Words and Music might represent have emerged from critical studies of the work:\n\nVivian Mercier treats the three characters as separate beings, Croak being an \"old man who shuffles in\" asking Words and Music to be friends.\nEugene Webb suggests that \"Croak is the name the dialogue directions give to the conscious self of the artist\".\nCharles Lyons says that \"[i]n Words and Music Beckett provides three characters who seem to represent different psychic functions of a single consciousness \u2026 [however] Beckett does not integrate them into the image of a specific, whole person.\" Also a number of times Lyons hints at the autobiographical nature of the piece though without providing any real evidence. It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

In July 1975, the British music magazine NME reported that Negron had been arrested for cocaine possession in Kentucky.

{"id": "264_303", "question": "What music label is All represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27485", "text": "Various readings of what the situation in Words and Music might represent have emerged from critical studies of the work:\n\nVivian Mercier treats the three characters as separate beings, Croak being an \"old man who shuffles in\" asking Words and Music to be friends.\nEugene Webb suggests that \"Croak is the name the dialogue directions give to the conscious self of the artist\".\nCharles Lyons says that \"[i]n Words and Music Beckett provides three characters who seem to represent different psychic functions of a single consciousness \u2026 [however] Beckett does not integrate them into the image of a specific, whole person.\" Also a number of times Lyons hints at the autobiographical nature of the piece though without providing any real evidence. It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

After trying his luck in Los Angeles for five years, McCarthy came back to Chicago in 1984, changed his name to Billy Dior, and founded The Chicago Molls together with Desi Rexx and Lizzy Valentine. The band played hard rock and glam rock. After rehearsing for about a year and performing in The Limelight nightclub in the style of the New York Dolls\u2014even sporting lingerie\u2014the band later toned down this approach when they relocated to Los Angeles at Dior's urging; he found the city to be the best place to pursue a recording contract. Guitarist S. Scot (\"S.S.\") Priest was still under contract with his other band Diamond Rexx, so he could not follow the band there, and instead was replaced by Sean Freehill.Two weeks after arriving in Los Angeles, while the band was recording demos  in a recording studio, they decided to have a few drinks at a pub down the street. There, they met two girls who were friends with an A&R person, and brought the girls back to the studio with them. When the A&R person came looking for the girls, the bandmates played their demos for him. Although seemingly disinterested at first, he agreed to try and get them a recording contract. Eight months later, the band, now under the name D'Molls, signed a contract with Atlantic Records, with Priest rejoining the band at this time.  Two years later, they released their debut album, D'Molls. The video for \"777\" received some airplay on MTV, but album sales failed to prosper. In 1990, the band released their second and final album on the Atlantic label, Warped. Featuring tracks \"Real Love\" and \"Father Time\", it combined simple sounding musical patterns with varying beat speeds. However, vocalist Rexx quit D'Molls and joined The David Lee Roth Band before the album's promotion campaign even got off the ground, and the group disbanded shortly thereafter. They did not release another album until 1996, when Delinquent Records featured the group's third and final album, Beyond D'Valley Of D'Molls, which featured three live tracks as well as previously unreleased studio recordings. There also exists a best of compilation CD, The Best of Everything, which came out in 2007. In 2011 Rexx released Desi Rexx's D'Moll's \"D'Sides\" on FnA Records.Dior and Valentine permanently left D'Molls in 1990 after the band officially disbanded.In 2004, Dior published a thriller novel under his birth name, Billy McCarthy, The Devil of Shakespeare, inspired in part by his experiences with the band and the 1980s Los Angeles glam rock scene. In 2015, he sued Poison for copyright infringement on several Poison hit songs, including, \"Talk Dirty To Me,\" for which the band failed to credit him as co-writer. Dior had played with Poison guitarist C.C. Deville when both were members of Kid Rocker and Screamin' Mimis. Poison ultimately settled with Dior out of court for an undeclared sum. In 2017, McCarthy published his sophomore effort at writing, Beat Me Till I'm Famous, an autobiographical memoir of his rags to rags experience as a professional musician in the 1980s, most of which covers the entire D'Molls story.\nIn 2018, Rexx reformed the band with Jonni Lightfoot (Air Supply 2001 - 2016) under the new name D'Molls 777, in homage to their song \"777\".

His distinctive style of piano playing was influenced by learning to play on an instrument that was missing some keys.He began his career in New Orleans in 1948. Mike Tessitore, owner of the Caldonia Club, gave Longhair his stage name. Longhair first recorded in a band called the Shuffling Hungarians in 1949, creating four songs (including the first version of his signature song, \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\") for the Star Talent record label. Union problems curtailed their release, but Longhair's next effort for Mercury Records the same year was a winner.  Throughout the 1950s, he recorded for Atlantic Records, Federal Records and local labels.\nProfessor Longhair had only one national commercial hit, \"Bald Head\", in 1950, under the name Roy Byrd and His Blues Jumpers. He also recorded his favorites, \"Tipitina\" and \"Go to the Mardi Gras\". He lacked crossover appeal among white and wide audiences. Yet, he is regarded (and was acknowledged) as being a musician who was highly influential for other prominent musicians, such as Fats Domino, Allen Toussaint and Dr. John.After suffering a stroke, Professor Longhair recorded \"No Buts \u2013 No Maybes\" in 1957. He re-recorded \"Go to the Mardi Gras\" in 1959. He first recorded \"Big Chief\" with its composer, Earl King, in 1964. In the 1960s, Professor Longhair's career faltered. He became a janitor to support himself and fell into a gambling habit.After a few years during which he disappeared from the music scene, Professor Longhair's musical career finally received \"a well deserved renaissance\" and wide recognition. He was invited to perform at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1971 and at the Newport Jazz Festival and the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1973. His album The London Concert showcases work he did on a visit to the United Kingdom. That significant career resurrection saw the recording of the album Professor Longhair \u2013 Live on the Queen Mary, which was recorded on March 24, 1975, during a private party hosted by Paul McCartney and Linda McCartney on board the retired RMS Queen Mary.By the 1980s his albums, such as Crawfish Fiesta on Alligator Records and New Orleans Piano on Atlantic Records, had become readily available across America. In 1974 he appeared on the PBS series Soundstage (with Dr. John, Earl King, and The Meters). In 1980 he co-starred (with Tuts Washington and Allen Toussaint) in the film documentary Piano Players Rarely Ever Play Together which was produced and directed by filmmaker Stevenson Palfi. That documentary (which aired on public television in 1982 and was rarely seen since), plus a long interview with Fess (which was recorded two days before his sudden death), were included in the 2018 released project \"Fess Up\".Professor Longhair died in his sleep of a heart attack while the filming of the documentary was under way (and before the live concert, which was planned to be its climax). Footage from his funeral was included in the documentary. He was interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in New Orleans.Professor Longhair's manager through those renaissance years of his career was Allison Miner, of which jazz producer George Wein was quoted saying: \"Her devotion to Professor Longhair gave him the best years of his life.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Epic Records anticipated that both the three-year gap since Combat Rock (1982) along with their updated sound, would result in critical acclaim and high sales. In the promotional lead up, Strummer told journalist Richard Cook that he was not going to release any new material until he knew it could \"last ten years\".

On release, British and American critics alike generally viewed the album in an unfavourable light. Melody Maker and NME both published sharply negative reviews, the latter of which was titled \"No Way, Jose\" in sarcastic reference to the \"Jose Unidos\" production credit.

Music journalist Richard Cromelin found the album's uptempo songs less effective than those on earlier Clash records, but concluded that Strummer's singing is compelling and \"This Is England\" and \"North and South\" make the record \"more than passable\".The absence of Jones and Headon led many to regard it as a Joe Strummer solo album\u2014an impression further solidified by Simonon's involvement being limited only to the pre-production stage. Its shortcomings were often attributed to Strummer's evident disillusionment with the group and the fact that he was grieving over the recent deaths of his parents. Joe Sasfy of The Washington Post wrote that the \"revised version of the Clash sounds like a pale and ghostly facsimile of this once-great band\"; he disliked the \"[tiresome] garbled choruses\" and he found that \"Strummer's attempt to enliven them with horn charts creates an ungainly mess of a sound.\" Similarly, Richard Defendorf of the Orlando Sentinel described the record as a \"sometimes embarrassingly anachronistic ... attempt to rekindle the Clash's punkish, militant energy.\" Music critic Liam Lacey was more favourable and concluded that, given the strength of \"This Is England\", \"in its cheesily self-aggrandizing way, the new Clash may be on to something.\"Cut the Crap has been favourably reevaluated in some retrospective reviews, many praising Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance. The writer Jon Savage praised the album in his influential 1991 book on the history of punk, England's Dreaming, highlighting the \"innovative use of rap rhythm and atmosphere\". Yet its reputation as a failure, or at least as a lost opportunity, has endured. In 2002, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described \"This Is England\" as \"surprisingly nervy\" on a record that, in his view, is otherwise \"formulaic, tired punk rock that doesn't have the aggression or purpose of early Clash records\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "264_378", "question": "What music label is The Good Rats represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_53675", "text": "Formed in 1964, the original group consisted of five students from St. John's University in Queens, New York: Ted Haenlein, Frank Stapleton (Frank never plugged in his bass as he did not play it, but it looked good on stage), Eric Crane, Denny Ryan and Peppi Marchello. The group was originally called the U-Men and played most of their gigs in the Rockaways (Peyton Place & McNultys) and Long Island (The Attic, Tiger's Tail etc.)\nIn 1966, Stapleton's brother, John, arranged for the group to play at a club in Queens, New York (The John Doe Room) where a record company executive heard them and eventually signed the band, but suggested a name change was in order. The band continued to play top 40 covers while working on their own original music.\nBy the fall of 1966 the composition of the band had changed with Peppi's brother Micky on guitar, Denny Ryan on drums, Teddy H. on rhythm & singing, and Art Fahie (aka/ Crazy Artie) on bass. The introduction of the \"Rats\" to Long Island's northshore took place at a club called the \"Knotty Knee\", whose owners Jack Dowd & Al Cunningham trusted the group to fill the venue seven-nights per week. A few years later, Marty Ross took ownership of the place under the name \"McDimples\", and for a while everything went on as it had been.  The \"Rats\" were also known for playing \"The Cage\" in Williston Park, as well as \"The Go-Go 7\" in Port Washington. In 1968, \"Teddy\" Haenlein was drafted and went to Vietnam, but did rejoin the group from 1970 to 1972.\nIn 1969, the band released their first album, the self-titled The Good Rats which had cult popularity with New Yorkers local and transplanted when it launched.  Two of its more memorable cuts are the intro song: \"We Are The Good Rats\" where the band members sing the \"hello-hello-hello\" greeting used by the 3 Stooges; and the landmark \"Joey Ferrari\", a proto-punk song (\"Joey Ferrari, though you're from the poor side, don't give you no right to go wild\"). The Good Rats continued to build a following, playing Long Island's thriving club scene, along with other groups, such as Twisted Sister and Zebra. From 1970 until early 1972, the band consisted of Peppi, Mickey, Teddy (guitar) John Argento (bass) and Charlie Zarou (drums). They played weekly at The Baldwin Manor, Back Alley Sallys (of which Peppi and John Argento took on a partnership of the bar). The Rats doing cover tunes, adding originals in, till originals were primarily asked for, during this time songs such as \"Hour Glass\", \"Injun Joe\", \"Mean Mother\", \"Yellow Flower\", were requested by a fan base that continued to grow rapidly. A rare studio recorded LP, recorded and mastered at Echo Studios, East Meadow, was used for shopping the band to record companies.\nIn 1974, the Good Rats released their best-known and most popular album, Tasty. It featured a blend of hard rock and blues, highlighted by Marchello's raspy vocals.  Various songs from this record, including \"Injun Joe\", \"Papa Poppa\", \"Back to My Music\" and \"The Songwriter\", and the blues title track, received airplay around the country on FM radio. During the following years, the Rats performed at venues such as Madison Square Garden, The Philadelphia Spectrum, The Nassau Coliseum, The Hammersmith Odeon in England, and New York's Central Park, as well as showcase rooms such as The Bottom Line (Manhattan), My Father's Place (Roslyn, New York), Whiskey a Go Go (Los Angeles), Casino Arena (Asbury Park, NJ) and The Paradise Room (Boston). They headlined or opened for bands such as Rush, Journey, Kiss, Meat Loaf, Aerosmith, Ozzy Osbourne, The Grateful Dead, Bruce Springsteen, The Allman Brothers Band, Mountain and Styx.Between 1976 and 1980, The Good Rats released a series of albums, including Ratcity in Blue, From Rats to Riches (1978), Birth Comes to Us All, and Live At Last, all of which were well received by the band's fan base, and received some airplay on FM radio.  In 1981, Gatto and Kotke left the band, and were replaced by future Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick and bass player Schuyler Deale (who later played with Billy Joel and Michael Bolton), for the album Great American Music. The band did shows until 1983 and then broke up.\nThroughout the 1980s, Peppi Marchello continued to write and produce recordings with his son Gene. They toured locally for a while under the name \"Popzarocca\" until the song \"First Love\" became a minor hit for Gene's band, Marchello.  Marchello also recorded a music video for \"First Love\", and had received minor airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball. This band featured Gene on guitar and lead vocals, drummer John Miceli (Meat Loaf, Rainbow, and bassist Nick DiMichino (NineDays [Something To Listen To, Monday Songs, Three, The Madding Crowd, So Happily Unsatisfied, Flying the Corporate Jet]), (Matt White [Best Days]). The band recorded two albums (only one which was released).\nIn the mid-1990s, Marchello and sons Gene Marchello and Stefan Marchello began playing out locally under \u201cThe Good Rats\u201d name. They released three new studio CDs with this lineup, Tasty Seconds (1996), Let's Have Another Beer (2000), and Play Dum (2002).  Marchello also released a live recording of a 1979 appearance on a Rochester radio show, Rats, The Way You Like \u2019Em.\nIn 1998, Marchello wrote \"A Tale of Two Balls,\" the introduction to the book Conflicts of Disinterest (Aardwolf Publishing) by Clifford Meth.In the 2000s, the band continued to play in local venues throughout New York, Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as playing annually in their own summer weekend outdoor festival aptly named \"Ratstock\".  At one point, the \"new\" Good Rats (Peppi and his sons) performed as the opening act for a reunion performance by the \"old\" Good Rats. Billed as \"The Original Good Rats\" Peppi was joined by Mickey, Kotke, Franco, and Gatto on October 4, 2008, in a small venue on Long Island, and for a pair of sold-out shows at B.B. King's in Manhattan.\nIn 2008, Gene Marchello left the band to go out on his own.  Nevertheless, The Good Rats, featuring Peppi and Stefan Marchello continued playing weekend club dates around Long Island.\nThe Good Rats were inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2008.\nPeppi Marchello is quoted prominently in the IDW Publishing graphic novel Snaked by Clifford Meth and has been the subject of other stories by the author.In July, 2009, Peppi Marchello cut a series of three commercials for the car donation organization Kars4Kids.In Magnolia Pictures 2011 release Roadie, the character Nikki pulls out Ratcity in Blue from Jimmy's vinyl record collection and they listen to a couple of tracks starting with \"Advertisement in the Voice\". This brings back memories of them seeing the band every Saturday night with their friend Steph when they were in high school. Peppi Marchello makes a cameo appearance in the film.\nIn 2012, Peppi Marchello released a new Good Rats album, Blue Collar Rats: The Lost Archives on his Uncle Rat Music label.  The CD contained one new song plus 19 previously unreleased songs recorded between 1975 and 1984, some featuring the original Good Rats line-up, and others including Kulick, Deale, Gene Marchello and various other musicians.\nThe Original Good Rats continued to play two spring shows (in one night) annually at Manhattan's B.B. King's, as well as a show in the fall at \"The Crazy Donkey\" in Long Island, until 2013.\nPeppi Marchello died on July 10, 2013, of a heart attack at his Nissequogue home. He was 68 and was recovering from heart surgery he had in June.Aardwolf Publishing announced the publication of Peppi Marchello: Song Writer on Kickstarter.In 2014, Stefan Marchello released a posthumous album of material that he and Peppi had worked on before Peppi's death, titled Afterlife. In 2016, he released Making Rock and Roll Great Again, an album that contains more of Peppi Marchello's posthumous material, plus some original material by Stefan Marchello.\nThe band now continues with Stefan Marchello.

The band, with vocalist Adam Agee at the forefront, has matured and altered their formula from blink-182-type power punk to meaningful vertical praise. Like their hard rock counterparts Kutless, the Arizona foursome seem to have found their true selves in praise & worship music, focusing their fierce rock energy like a laser beam to connect with listeners in new and amazing ways.\"Jay of New Release Tuesday went on to say: \"Stellar Kart\u2019s fourth studio project Everything is Different Now is in no way a let down. In fact, I believe this to be the best project from Stellar Kart yet, as the band proves to be improving more with each and every project. I can recommend this album to any Christian music fan in general, because it contains everything from worship, to rock, and even includes Stellar Kart\u2019s very own punk sound. This is an awesome album!\"The Christian Manifesto wrote, regarding the album: \"Stellar Kart has done a lot of work, but as always, there is still more to do. It would be great for them to tackle slower, unhurried songs and I would love to see them continue to write more of their own work. Nevertheless there is plenty for the fans to love and for newcomers to enjoy. All in all, I believe that Everything is Different Now sets the standard and is the foundation from which Stellar Kart will continue to work on. As a massive improvement on their past efforts, it goes to show how bands can develop and get better with time. This LP reminds us how far a little bit of change can go in the journey of development \u2026 I\u2019m hoping that their next release will revolutionize everything again, and let us join them on their adventure.\"On the other side, Brandon J. of Indie Vision Music stated plainly: \"This band does have talent deep within. What Stellar Kart needs to do to break the chains of repetition is to drop their producer, not because he isn't cutting it but because it\u2019s time for a change of scenery. They need to take back all the writing credits for their songs and not rely on others to do the work for them. They need to stop doing tours of teen girl conventions, and youth night at the local Church. If they really want to expand their horizons, it\u2019s time to test the waters and go out on their own. Maybe tour with other General market bands, or like minded Christian artists who have  a similar style. I\u2019m not 16 anymore and I seriously doubt any of these guys are near that age so it\u2019s time to grow up a bit. I know that sounds harsh but the writing style on this album is aimed at Christian teens and it\u2019s like it was purposely written that way. I can\u2019t be the only guy feeling this way? Maybe I'm just burnt out on the Contemporary Christian Market because I've been a part of it in some small way for so many years.\"  Nathaniel Schexnayder of Jesus Freak Hideout concurred by saying: \"I've always thought that Stellar Kart has needed to make changes, both musically and lyrically, to make themselves a more stand-out band. However, while changes have been implemented with their latest release, I can't help but wonder if the album has set them back. Undoubtedly, Stellar Kart fans will fall in love with Everything Is Different Now, but, as a whole, I couldn't wait to stop listening to Stellar Kart\u2019s overproduced, underwhelming album. Maybe I'm just cynical. Or maybe this is just Stellar Kart\u2019s fourth half-hearted album in five years which fails to show both musical and lyrical maturity.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Previously, the group had released their major-label debut, My Dinosaur Life (2010) on Columbia; the band parted ways with the label due to the record's lackluster commercial response. Following this, the band returned to their home of Minneapolis, Minnesota, with producer and longtime friend Ackerson. The band entered a local studio and recorded their next effort on their own time and finances. The band recorded Go without a label, and put it upon themselves to pay for mixing and mastering and have conversations with distributors later.\nFrontman Justin Pierre composed the lyrics for Go, which is themed around mortality, growing older, and learning to live in the moment. The reflective tone includes subjects such as procrastination, relationship miscommunication, and optimism, but also personal struggles such as the death of loved ones. Many songs on Go were developed over years at a time, and several date to the band's first few studio albums. Musically, the album retains the band's pop-rock, Moog-based sound, with a heavier emphasis on electronic experimentation. Following the album's recording, the band entered talks with Epitaph Records, where they were signed from 2003 to 2008.

Rubin continued his association with hip-hop music as well by signing artists such as the Geto Boys and Sir Mix-a-Lot. Def American had its first major success with The Black Crowes' 1990 debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, which was eventually certified quintuple platinum by the RIAA.

Rubin produced many of the recordings on the label, as well as directing other related ventures.\nRubin changed the name of the company from Def American Recordings to American Recordings in 1993 after reportedly seeing the word \"def\" in the dictionary.

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

He described Kid A as the \"defining moment in the Radiohead legend\". A year later, Billboard argued that Kid A was the first album since Bowie's Low to have moved \"rock and electronic music forward in such a mature fashion\". In an article for Kid A's 20th anniversary, the Quietus suggested that the negative reviews had been motivated by rockism, the tendency among music critics to venerate rock music over other genres.In a 2011 Guardian article about his critical Melody Maker review, Beaumont wrote that though his opinion had not changed, \"Kid A's status as a cultural cornerstone has proved me, if not wrong, then very much in the minority ...

The lawsuit alleged that the song misappropriates Parks' name, and it objected to the song's obscenities.The song's lyrics are virtually unrelated to Parks, except for a reference in the chorus: \"Ah ha, hush that fuss / Everybody move to the back of the bus\". The song, which Outkast maintained was intended partly as homage, refers to Parks metaphorically: the purpose of the song's chorus is to imply that Outkast is overturning hip hop's old order, and that people should make way for a new style and sound. In the initial suit, the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan at Ann Arbor granted summary judgment for Outkast.\nLater on appeal, the issue of whether Outkast violated the Lanham Act for false advertising was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. This was based on the Court's determination that the title \"Rosa Parks\" had little artistic relevance, whether symbolic or metaphorical, to Rosa Parks the person. Parks' representation hired lawyer Johnnie Cochran to appeal the decision in 2001, but the appeal was denied. The judge ruled that while there was linkage between the song and Rosa Parks, the song was an \"expressive work\" and was therefore protected by the First Amendment. In 2003, the Supreme Court turned down an appeal to overrule the lower court's decision.In December 2003, Andr\u00e9 told UK journalist Angus Batey that, following a Detroit concert in the midst of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case had less to do with Parks than with the lawyers. In April 2005, the judge in the case appointed an impartial representative for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and her lawyers were pursuing the case based on their own financial interest. The case was settled on 14 April 2005, with Outkast and the co-defendants, Sony BMG and its subsidiaries Arista Records and LaFace Records, admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to develop and fund educational programs concerning Rosa Parks.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Usher and Arista held advance listenings for the album, a few months before its actual release; he also appeared on TV guestings to promote Confessions.With strategies to boost the album's sales albeit threats of stealing music in the internet, Usher and his management readied a follow-up release of Confessions with an additional marketing blitz. The idea was considered \"musically driven\" after Zomba, who absorbed Arista, management was excited about \"My Boo\", a song that was recorded for the original version of the album but failed to meet deadline. However, it actually began when American R&B and soul singer Alicia Keys, who is featured on the track, \"brought in that the talk of repackaging started\". With the inclusion of \"My Boo\", they thought of the album as complete. While they knew of other artists releasing special editions of their albums, the label felt that Confessions had the edge because of its previous success and its physical changes, including new cover art, an expanded CD booklet, a pullout poster and a letter to fans from Usher. The new version includes \"My Boo\" and \"Red Light\", which were leaked alongside other songs that did not appear in the album, and a remix of \"Confessions Part II\", and \"Seduction\"; original tracks were also improved like the extended version of \"Confessions Part I\" and a rap added by American rapper Jadakiss in \"Throwback\". The label itself treated the version a new album, with full media advertisements. The album was re-issued in October 2004, seven months after its initial release.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on 36 reviews. AllMusic writer Tim Sendra said the album was \"filled with giant washes of sound bathed in reverb, echoing keyboards, smears of strings, and massed backing vocals, the album ebbs and flows from giant crescendos to heartbreakingly intimate moments with Jonsi's otherworldly voice riding the waves like a mythical dolphin\", ending the review saying, \"On the surface, Valtari may seem like a step back for the band, but instead of just retreading the past, the album is one of their best; a refined display of their musical power with breathtaking dynamics and enough emotion to flood an ocean.\" The A.V. Club said that \"the relative restraint on the single 'Ekki M\u00fakk' and other more straightforward songs like 'Var\u00fa\u00f0' and 'Rembihn\u00fatur' is a welcome shift for the group, ditching the bigger-is-better grandiloquence and predictable arcs of Sigur R\u00f3s' recent work.\" BBC Music writer Wyndham Wallace said that \"much of the album sounds like it's made up of what would, in previous years, have only qualified as the introductions to songs. Opening track \"\u00c9g anda\" takes an age to get underway, reverb-heavy guitars chiming quietly before J\u00f3nsi's distinctive falsetto floats in over what sounds like an army of music boxes, and, though Rembihn\u00fatur lifts off towards its end in a familiar fashion, drums are largely limited to distorted electronic pulses and there are none of the earth-scorching effects that have previously characterised similar moments,\" and that \"for those more patient, however, the album represents calm after a storm, and highlights how Sigur R\u00f3s remain as eager to challenge themselves as their audience.\"Drowned in Sound stated that \"this is not an album of easy melodies, of playful riffs and crowd-pleasing moments. Indeed, it seems not for the crowd at all: as background music this fades away, shrinking into a still corner away from the noise.\" They later said that \"Valtari seems rather brave: across a runtime of nearly an hour there's little effort to hold our attention, to vary the tone or venture anywhere, anywhere near mainstream appeal. And sure, huge swathes of this may run the risk of passing by unnoticed, of blurring into a single reverbed note, but that's our responsibility, and quite frankly our loss\", ending the review saying \"Valtari might not be a huge digression for the band but that doesn't matter: this is quietly, entrancingly and thoroughly sublime.\" NME, however, wrote that \"this record will maintain their fan base, but it won't attract a new one\". Pitchfork was not so positive either, stating, \"The problem isn't that Valtari aspires to beauty, even if it's a commonplace, celestial understanding of it. Sigur R\u00f3s have proven they can make indelible music that's pretty and unpredictable, pretty and melodic, pretty and unnerving, pretty and inspiring. Valtari wants to be pretty and that's it.\" Rolling Stone said that \"J\u00f3nsi's exquisite vocals evoke prayers or lullabies, while pecked-out piano melodies play amid dulcimer tones, sonar burps, elf choirs.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child, MTV's James Montgomery noted that \"they have left a fairly sizable legacy behind\" as \"one of the best-selling female pop vocal groups in history.\" Billboard observed that Destiny's Child were \"defined by a combination of feisty female empowerment anthems, killer dance moves and an enviable fashion sense,\" while Essence noted that they \"set trends with their harmonious music and cutting-edge style.\" In 2015, Daisy Jones of Dazed Digital published an article on how the group made a significant impact in R&B music, writing \"Without a hint of rose tint, Destiny's Child legitimately transformed the sound of R&B forever... their distinct influence can be found peppered all over today's pop landscape, from Tinashe to Ariana Grande.\" Nicole Marrow of The Cut magazine believed that R&B music in the 1990s and early 2000s \"was virtually redefined by the success of powerhouse performers like TLC and Destiny's Child, who preached a powerful litany of embracing womanhood and celebrating individuality.\" Hugh McIntyre of Forbes wrote that before The Pussycat Dolls and Danity Kane burst onto the music scene in the mid-2000s, Destiny's Child were \"the reigning queens\" of the girl group genre.Writing for Pitchfork, Katherine St. Asaph noticed how Destiny's Child defined the revival of girl groups similar to The Supremes in the early-to-mid-'90s, saying:\n\nThere is no better microcosm of what happened to Top 40 music between 1993 and 1999 than this. Bands like the \u201cStar Search\u201d winner were buried in a landfill of post-grunge, while R&B groups built out from soul and quiet storm to create a sound innovative enough to earn the \u201cfuturistic\u201d label almost everything got in that pre-Y2K time.

Billboard recognized them as one of the greatest musical trios of all time; they were also ranked as the third most successful girl group of all time on the Billboard charts, behind TLC and The Supremes. The group's single \"Independent Women\" (2000) ranked second on Billboard's list of the \"Top 40 Biggest Girl Group Songs of All Time on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart\". \"Independent Women\" was also acknowledged by the Guinness World Records as the longest-running number-one song on the Hot 100 by a girl group. The term \"Bootylicious\" (a combination of the words booty and delicious) became popularized by Destiny's Child's single of the same and was later added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006. The term was also used to describe Beyonc\u00e9 during the 2000s decade due to her curvaceous figure. VH1 included \"Bootylicious\" on their \"100 Greatest Songs of the '00s\" list in 2011, and Destiny's Child on their \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list the following year. Additionally, \"Independent Women\" was ranked as one of NME's \"100 Best Songs of the 00s\".

Ciara was inspired to pursue a career in music after seeing Destiny's Child perform on television. Ariana Grande cited Destiny's Child as one of her vocal inspirations, saying that listening to the group's music is how she discovered her range and \"learned about harmonies and runs and ad-libs.\" Meghan Trainor stated that her single \"No\" (2016) was inspired by the late 1990s and early 2000s sounds of Destiny's Child, NSYNC, and Britney Spears. Fifth Harmony cited Destiny's Child as their biggest inspiration, and even paid tribute to the group by performing a medley of \"Say My Name\", \"Independent Women\", \"Bootylicious\" and \"Survivor\" on the television show Greatest Hits.

A promotion plan was created for Clarkson for Breakaway's release. Davis positioned her to be RCA's top global priority, and at the recommendation of The Firm, removed American Idol from her official biography. Rather than being booked on arenas for her tour, Kwatinetz booked Clarkson for smaller amphitheaters to hone her performance skills. He remarked, \"American Idol gave her a lot of exposure that allowed her to skip some steps in her development, and that's hazardous.\" Breakaway was first released internationally on January 3, 2005, by the Bertelsmann Music Group (now Sony Music Entertainment), and was released in the United Kingdom on July 18, 2005, by RCA.

This included the influence of classic rock on the band's music, their use of feedback, extreme volume as well as loud-quiet dynamic, combined with Mascis's droning vocals. A characteristic of Mascis's vocal style is frequent use of vocal fry. Gerald Cosloy, head of Homestead Records, summarized the band's music: \"It was its own bizarre hybrid. ... It wasn't exactly pop, it wasn't exactly punk rock\u2014it was completely its own thing\".Mascis listened to classic rock artists such as the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, elements of which were incorporated into Dinosaur Jr.'s sound. In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as The Birthday Party, and has frequently noted Nick Cave as an influence. Dinosaur Jr. combined elements of hardcore punk and noise rock into their songs, which often featured a large amount of feedback, distortion and extreme volume. When the master tape of You're Living All Over Me arrived at SST, the label's production manager noticed the level on the tape was so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed it was the way he wanted the album to sound.Similar to Mascis's guitar work, Barlow's bass lines with their alternating heavily distorted, fast chords and pulverizing lows, draw heavily from both his hardcore past and musicians such as Lemmy and Johnny Ramone. On his influences, Barlow stated that \"...Johnny Ramone is my hero. I wanted to make that rhythmic chugging sound like he got playing guitar with the Ramones. And, I found that I got a bigger sound by strumming farther up the neck.\"Mascis's vocals are another distinctive feature of Dinosaur Jr.'s music. He attributed his \"whiny low-key drawl\", the opposite of the hardcore punk \"bark\", to artists such as John Fogerty and Mick Jagger. His style also resembled Neil Young's, but Mascis disputed this and later commented: \"That got annoying, being compared all the time.\" His drawl epitomized the band's slacker ethos and relaxed attitude; author Michael Azerrad said \"even Mascis seemed removed from the feelings he was conveying in the music.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Amos is notable for releasing \"genre-bending\" albums, according to LA Weekly music reviewer Chris Martins, and for being a prolific songwriter; one account in Spike Magazine suggests he has written over a thousand songs. Amos is also a multi-instrumentalist for groups such as Grails and Om and Lilacs & Champagne. Amos was born of the lo-fi home recording movement of the '80s and early '90s.Amos described the mission of his music as \"facing your personal reality\". Amos said in an interview that, beginning at age 16, he used drugs every single day and did not let up for years. A music critic for The Guardian described him as a prolific songwriter and as having a \"great voice\". Reviewer Rob Cullivan of the Portland Tribune described Holy Sons' album Survivalist Tales to be an \"ode to the dime novels in the early 1900s that peddled the stories of wilderness explorers,\" and described the music as \"sonic wanderings\" with \"strange song structures\". A review in the Portland Mercury described his music as \"dark, languid psychedelia\" and commented how Amos has \"habitually been kept underground\" with few live performances up until the last few years. His vocals have been compared to Neil Young but change personalities quite often. Willamette Week described the album Decline of the West as \"a varied, meticulously constructed piece of avant-folk that stands alone by its own merits.\"", "hasanswer": true}]}

A pianist possessed of great virtuosity, he was also a Harvard-educated biochemist and his musical art\u2014both compositions and performance\u2014and emerged from a confluence of the two.

As a scientist-musician he believed that musical tones, if properly employed, could influence the evolution of the brain.\"Joe Morris recalled: \"His music was much more about sound. He used to talk about the upper partials clashing together. It was very slow moving, it was much more about sounds slowly morphing into other sounds... It was... like what you would call electroacoustic improvisation now. His trio music, even though it had bass and drums, moved at a very slow pace. It had a sort of groove, but it was very different. And he operated differently. His rhetoric was very different. I don't think he ever thought of himself as a jazz musician; he just saw himself as a musician. He was a very dignified, incredibly brilliant guy. He would never lower himself to some mere label.\" Morris added: \"He was so brilliant in the way he spoke about things; it was impossible to dismiss it as just crazy talk. Even though at first it sounded like that, over time I understood what he was talking about, and we could have conversations. He used to say it was about evolution, that if we play things we haven't heard before, it will alter the biochemistry of the brain. He said that's what evolution is about... I understand that what he was really trying to do was to move humans forward.\" Regarding Davidson's funeral, Morris stated: \"The music played by the church band circled and rose to the ceiling. The sounds clashed and blended. The partials merged. It sounded like Lowell's music.\"Taylor McLean, a musician who had met Davidson at Harvard, stated that despite Davidson's personal issues, his life was \"positive and victorious.\" He recalled that Davidson lived in an \"alternative universe\" in which he was successful: \"It is a form of success that is little understood, and that brings with it no comforts. The artist is driven to pursue and formulate successive objective forms. That is the only way to cross the river and stay alive in the current.

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

After military service, he returned to Memphis in 1964, and started a singing career with the small Genie label where he met Isaac Hayes and David Porter.  Soon, Stax founder Estelle Axton hired him to work at the record shop attached to the company's Satellite Studios, where he stayed for three years, also recording for the Minit label. His three consecutive releases, \"A Lot of Love\", \"60 Minutes of Your Love\" (both 1966), and \"Hooked  By  Love \" (1967), all found success in England, eventually becoming Northern Soul classics. \"A Lot of Love\" formed the musical basis of the Spencer Davis Group hit single \"Gimme Some Lovin'\" released in October 1966. In 1999, \"A Lot of Love\" was covered by the British band Simply Red and released as \"Ain't That a Lot of Love\".\nJim Stewart at Stax refused to give Banks a contract as a singer, but eventually Stax did give him a songwriting contract.  He began working with co-writer Allen Jones, placing songs with Johnnie Taylor and Sam and Dave, and also writing \"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\", later a UK hit for Elvis Costello.  Banks had greater success with the Staple Singers, writing their first Stax single \"Long Walk to DC\", and then some of their biggest hits including \"If You're Ready (Come Go with Me)\".In 1968, he formed a songwriting trio with Bettye Crutcher and Raymond Jackson, calling themselves We Three.  Their first song was \"Who's Making Love\", which was recorded by Johnnie Taylor and became a # 3 pop hit and # 1 R&B hit, Stax's biggest.  Banks also wrote, with Jackson and Carl Hampton, \"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\", a song first recorded by The Emotions which became a hit when recorded by Luther Ingram, and later recorded by Isaac Hayes and Millie Jackson and many other singers, including Barbara Mandrell, Rod Stewart and Cassandra Wilson.Banks' twin brother James also worked for Stax, co-writing the company's last big hit, Shirley Brown's \"Woman to Woman\".After Stax folded, Homer Banks and Carl Hampton signed a publishing deal with A&M Records and moved to California, where they continued to write but with less success. In 1977, as Banks and Hampton, they recorded the album Passport to Ecstasy for Warner Bros. Records. In the 1980s, Banks formed the Two's Company recording company with Lester Snell, which released albums by J. Blackfoot and Ann Hines. In 1983, Banks, Reginald Jenkins and Chuck Brooks formed Sound Town Records, Inc. and released the top twenty album on J. Blackfoot titled City Slicker. It included the R&B top five single \"Taxi\" and also debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, which he wrote and produced with Chuck Brooks. Banks and Brooks also produced the Intimate Storm album on the Sound Town Records label, which included four singles that made the Billboard R&B chart. All of these songs were produced for World Production Company formed and owned by Banks, Reginald (Reggie) Jenkins and Chuck Brooks.\nHomer Banks died in Memphis of cancer, aged 61.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Many of the songs he wrote as a member of Irving didn't fit the group's style, so Church began performing as Sea Wolf with a rotating ensemble of backing musicians, playing locally in Los Angeles and recording demos in Seattle with producer Phil Ek. Sea Wolf signed to Dangerbird Records in 2007 and released the Get To The River Before It Runs Too Low EP and a full-length titled Leaves In The River. The latter hit No. 24 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Church named the band after Jack London's novel The Sea-Wolf, saying that he identifies with the main character, a sea captain who is a \"self-taught, blue-collar intellectual guy.\"On September 22, 2009, Sea Wolf's second album, White Water, White Bloom was released by Dangerbird Records. The album was produced by Mike Mogis at his studio in Omaha. Sea Wolf contributed a song entitled \"Song of the Magpie\" to the audio book for Augusten Burroughs' book \"A Wolf at the Table\". Burroughs asked Sea Wolf\u2019s Alex Brown Church to read the book and respond with an original song. Sea Wolf also wrote a song titled \"The Violet Hour\" in 2009 for the second part of the Twilight movie series, New Moon.\nFollowing the release of Old World Romance in 2012, Church and company toured extensively before returning to the Sea Wolf studio in late 2013 to write and record an experimental 'stripped down' album, which would eventually be titled Song Spells, No. 1: Cedarsmoke. The album was meant to explore the sonic landscape and feel of the earliest Sea Wolf songs while also providing an outlet for Church to experiment with new ideas and working methods. Geared toward existing fans of the band, the album was not intended as the next 'official' label-backed studio album, and was funded through a highly successful Kickstarter campaign. During the 4 month process of writing and recording the album, the idea of the series came about, and while it was never intended to be released on a wide scale, soon after its completion it was announced that this first entry in the series would be 'given back to fans' by releasing it exclusively through music streaming services and as a pay-what-you-wish download on the band's website.\nThe band announced in early 2017 via its website and social media that a new album is in progress.On December 5, 2019, the band released a new single titled \"Fear of Failure\", and announced their new studio album titled Through A Dark Wood.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Contrary to the album's title, it is not a \"live\" album but rather a studio recording.\nAlthough the album received generally positive reviews, many consumers were confused by its title and assumed it to be a live album, which in fact it was not. The title was actually a reference to Camp X-Ray, the temporary detention facility located at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Some fans and critics expressed their disappointment at the album's length, stating that a playing time of 26 minutes was not sufficient for a full-length album and that they had expected more creative output from the band. By this time, however, the band's members had drifted heavily into other projects (most notably singer/guitarist John Reis, who was simultaneously playing in Hot Snakes and Sultans and running his record label Swami Records) and were not as creatively dedicated to Rocket as they had been in the past. Cryptic liner notes written by Long Gone John seemed to indicate that the album was a \"last gasp\" of a band in turmoil and that it might be their final album.\nTouring in support of Live from Camp X-Ray was sparse due to the band members' commitments to other projects, and they would perform infrequently over the next few years. In August 2005, after breaking up Hot Snakes, Reis announced that Rocket from the Crypt would play their final performance on Halloween of that year. This confirmed suspicions that Live from Camp X-Ray was the band's final studio album, though posthumous releases of material recorded before their breakup have since been released.\n\"Bring Us Bullets\" is notable for being featured in the film Crank.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Rubin continued his association with hip-hop music as well by signing artists such as the Geto Boys and Sir Mix-a-Lot. Def American had its first major success with The Black Crowes' 1990 debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, which was eventually certified quintuple platinum by the RIAA. The group's 1992 follow-up, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, gave the label its first No.1 album. Rapper Sir Mix-a-Lot obtained a number-one hit with the song \"Baby Got Back\" as well as a platinum-selling album entitled Mack Daddy. Heavy metal acts Slayer and Danzig also enjoyed notable commercial success, with Slayer in particular having several gold certified albums. Rubin produced many of the recordings on the label, as well as directing other related ventures.\nRubin changed the name of the company from Def American Recordings to American Recordings in 1993 after reportedly seeing the word \"def\" in the dictionary. The company was reportedly renamed because he believed that finding the word in a notable source was against the anti-establishment image that he was trying to project. A mock funeral was held for the word \"Def\" on August 27, 1993. The guest list included Black Panthers with prop shotguns, The Amazing Kreskin, Tom Petty and Rosanna Arquette, The Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea, Sir Mix-a-Lot and Warner Bros.

Worrell was later replaced by various other bassists, including Reggie Workman, Finn Von Eyben, Harold Dodson, Eddie G\u00f3mez, Steve Swallow, and Buell Neidlinger. All About Jazz reviewer Clifford Allen wrote that the group \"cut some of the most powerful music in the free jazz underground\".In November 1962, Tchicai moved from his home country of Denmark to New York City at the suggestion of Archie Shepp and Bill Dixon, whom he had met at the Helsinki Jazz Festival earlier that year. Upon arriving in New York, Tchicai began playing with Dixon's group, which included Shepp and Roswell Rudd among others, and also sat in with Don Cherry and various other musicians. By the summer of 1963, Tchicai, Shepp, and Cherry had formed the New York Contemporary Five with bassist Don Moore and drummer J. C. Moses, while Rudd, with Shepp, continued to play with Dixon. According to Rudd, the idea of forming a new quartet originated with Tchicai, and the two began playing in filmmaker Michael Snow's loft space with Moore and Moses. Moses soon left as a result of mutual dissatisfaction with his role, and Rudd and Tchicai were soon introduced to drummer Milford Graves by saxophonist Giuseppi Logan. Tchicai recalled: \"this was a very pleasant surprise and more than that, because Graves simply baffled both Rudd and I in that we, at that time, hadn't heard anybody of the younger musicians in New York that had the same sense of rhythmic cohesion in poly-rhythmics or the same sense of intensity and musicality.\" Graves \"wound up playing with them for half an hour, astonishing Rudd and Tchicai, who promptly invited him to join what became The New York Art Quartet\". Graves later stated that his invitation to join the group came \"at a time when the evolutive phases of my spiritual and creative potential were in need of being expressed without limitation\". However, Tchicai also recalled that \"bassist Don Moore became so frightened of this wizard of a percussionist that he decided that this couldn't be true or possible and, therefore, refused to play with us\", and the group brought in bassist Lewis Worrell in his place.In July 1964, Tchicai and Rudd briefly joined Albert Ayler's quartet, which consisted of Ayler, Cherry, Gary Peacock, and Sunny Murray, to record New York Eye and Ear Control, the soundtrack for a film by Michael Snow. That fall, the NYAQ, calling themselves \"The John Tchicai Quartet\", played their debut concert, participating in the \"October Revolution in Jazz\" organized by Bill Dixon. In November, the NYAQ recorded their first album as part of ESP Disk's original roster of jazz artists, and a month later they performed at the Dixon-organized festival \"Four Days in December\" as the \"Roswell Rudd - John Tchicai Quartet\", playing opposite Sun Ra at Judson Hall. The group's second album, Mohawk, was recorded in July 1965 with Reggie Workman on bass (Worrell left the group in December 1964), and was released on the Fontana label. In the fall of 1965, Tchicai lined up dates for the NYAQ in Copenhagen, Gothenburg (Sweden), Hilversum (Holland), and Amsterdam (where they opened for Ornette Coleman's group), with Finn Von Eyben playing bass and Louis Moholo playing drums as a result of scheduling issues with the original musicians. Recordings from this tour were issued on Roswell Rudd, released in 1971 without Rudd's consent, and in 2010 on the album Old Stuff. The group broke up in February 1966, with Tchicai returning to Denmark.On June 13, 1999, the NYAQ, with Workman on bass, reunited for a performance at the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, opening for Sonic Youth. Amiri Baraka, whose poem \"Black Dada Nihilismus\" was included on their debut album 35 years earlier, also appeared. The group recorded the album 35th Reunion  the following day. In 2000 they played the Paris Banlieues Blues Festival, followed by a performance at the Lisboa festival in 2001. In 2013, after Tchicai's death, Triple Point Records released a limited-edition five-LP box set, along with a 156-page coffee-table book and miscellaneous artifacts, entitled Call It Art.According to Tchicai, one of the most unique aspects of the NYAQ was \"the polyphonic part of the music that came into play; the whole collective style of playing that also existed in New Orleans Jazz and classical music. The polyphonic aspect of our music was something quite new compared to what other people were doing in contemporary jazz.\" David Toop described the group's signature sound as \"deliberately ragged, bleary themes tumbling out in spasms, notes tailing away as if lost to daydream, the music so open that total collapse seems perpetually imminent\". In his liner notes to Mohawk, Tchicai wrote: \"The important thing about our music is that it must be heard and listened to without preconceived ideas as to how jazz should sound \u2013 listen to it as MUSIC and let that be the only label!\"A documentary on the NYAQ, entitled The Breath Courses Through Us, was released in 2013 by director Alan Roth.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by Virgin Records (EMI France). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist Kelly Rowland, who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by Nervo.\nAccording to Rowland, the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album Here I Am (2011), while Guetta noted \"When Love Takes Over\" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds. Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track. Veronica Ferraro mixed the song, focusing primarily on giving Rowland's vocals a magical and inspiring tone. Critics would later state that Rowland's vocals on \"When Love Takes Over\" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist. The song's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other, while the production bears some similarities to Coldplay's 2002 hit single \"Clocks\".\n\"When Love Takes Over\" received universal acclaim. Most noted the addition of Rowland's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from One Love. The song was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries, including in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland. At the time of release, it became Guetta's highest-charting single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Rowland's second number one single in the United Kingdom. \"When Love Takes Over\" ranked at number one on Billboard's Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart. In 2013, Billboard named \"When Love Takes Over\" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time, in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging electronic dance music trend in America at its time of release.\nIn the song's accompanying music video, Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together. It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result. \"When Love Takes Over\" was promoted mainly at award shows, including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards, NRJ Music Awards and the World Music Awards. Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \"When Love Takes Over\" for the annual Miss Universe competition. The single earned several Platinum and Gold certifications, selling over 5.5 million copies worldwide. Additionally, it earned Guetta two Grammy Award nominations for \"Best Dance Recording\" and \"Best Non-Classical, Remixed Recording\", the latter of which Guetta won for his \"Electro Extended Mix\" of \"When Love Takes Over\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

The viewer seems to be on a level with the children but also looking down on them.  \nThe two subjects of the painting are the daughters of the illustrator Frederick Barnard \u2013 a friend of Sargent's. Dolly, left, was 11 years old and Polly, right, seven years old; they were chosen for their blonde hair, replacing Sargent's original model, Francis Davis Millet's five-year-old daughter, dark-haired Katherine.\nThe title comes from the refrain of a popular song \"Ye Shepherds Tell Me\" by Joseph Mazzinghi, a pastoral glee for a trio of male voices, which mentions Flora wearing \"A wreath around her head, around her head she wore, Carnation, lily, lily, rose\".The work is set in an English garden at Farnham House in Broadway in the Cotswolds, where Sargent spent the summer of 1885 with Millet shortly after moving to England from Paris to escape the scandal caused by his 1884 painting Portrait of Madame X. The author Robert Louis Stevenson was also staying there while writing A Child's Garden of Verses and his verses inspired Sargent.\nSargent also took inspiration from the lanterns that he saw hanging among trees and lilies while boating on the River Thames at Pangbourne with American artist Edwin Austin Abbey in September 1885.\nSargent wanted to capture the exact level of light at dusk so he painted the picture en plein air \u2013 outdoors and in the Impressionist manner.\nEvery day from September to November 1885, he painted in the few minutes when the light was perfect, giving the picture an overall purple tint of evening.\nThe flowers in the garden died as summer turned to autumn, and they were replaced with artificial flowers.\nSargent resumed painting the following summer at Millet's new home nearby in Broadway and finally finished the painting by the end of October 1886.  \nIn the course of working, Sargent cut down the rectangular canvas, removing approximately 2 feet (61 cm) from the left side, to leave an approximately square shape.The work received a mixed reception at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1887, with some criticising his \"Frenchified\" style. However, there was also much praise, and Sir Frederic Leighton, President of the Royal Academy, encouraged the Tate Gallery to buy the painting later that year, using money from the Chantrey Bequest. It was the first of Sargent's works to be acquired by a public museum. The painting remains part of the Tate collection and is displayed at Tate Britain.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Thomsen formed their first band, Cruiser, at the age of 17. Streymoy also played with them for a short while. They later changed their name to Wolfgang. Although neither band released any albums, Wolfgang, who are still active, recorded an undisclosed number of songs that, according to Joensen, are \"pretty much ready to release\".T\u00fdr formed in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1998. Heri Joensen met his old bandmate, K\u00e1ri Streymoy, at a party in January in Copenhagen. Joensen suggested to Streymoy that they should meet up and jam. Streymoy initially declined, but later took him up on his offer. They were soon joined by another former bandmate, bassist Gunnar H. Thomsen, expanding the duo into a trio. In 2001, guitarist Terji Skiben\u00e6s joined the band.\nThey signed a worldwide deal with Austria's Napalm Records in early 2006, while signed to the Faroese record label Tutl. In September 2012, they signed a three-album deal with Metal Blade Records.They began making music which was heavily inspired by Norse mythology, kv\u00e6\u00f0i (Faroese traditional music), and heavy metal music in general. According to the band's frontman Heri Joensen:\n\"T\u00fdr's musical mission is to break down the walls that are erected between all the kinds of metal that have arisen over the years. Power, doom, black, progressive, gothic, viking, folk, ethnic and epic metal. Walls and labels do nothing but fill people with prejudice.\"\nAccordingly, scholarship has found that the band's lyrics and imagery promote pan-Nordic ideologies, and draw on well established, transnational genre conventions from metal music; but has also suggested that the band's insistence on their Faroese identity, which has been fetishised by international audiences, could be \"regarded as a form of self-exoticisation\". The band's handling of traditional songs is characterised by fidelity to traditional melodies, but more complex and innovative handling of associated chord progressions and harmonies.The band has been accused of promoting Nazi ideologies through their use of runes and other imagery appropriated by Nazis. The band responded to these accusations with the song \"Shadow of the Swastika\" on the album Lay of Thrym (2011), which in the assessment of Karl Spracklen, \"attacks the far-right for appropriating...heathen symbols and images associated with pre-Christian northern Europe\". Even so, scholars have, in the words of Catherine Hoad and Samuel Whiting, suggested that \"through imagining the Viking as an ancestral, genetic category, the 'common past' of the Nordic people is constructed as a self-identity apart from other people\" in the work of T\u00fdr. Likewise, Spracklen finds that \"the themes in T\u00fdr's songs celebrate pagan identity, Viking identity and the hegemonic masculinity of the Viking warrior combined with the modern-day heavy metal anthem of being an individual\".The band released the song \"Rainbow Warrior\", a song about the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in response to their campaign against whaling in the Faroe Islands.

Promis from AllMusic, this album is similar to Lisa Stansfield, except for a few more adventurous tracks. \"'Let's Just Call It Love' incorporates the British 2-step garage beats which makes it an unusual but interesting leadoff single. [...] The album's opener, 'I've Got Something Better,' is classic, funky Lisa Stansfield at her best, and the song gets more and more fun with each repeated listening. Other standouts include the Burt Bacharach-ish show-stopping ballad 'How Could You?,' the pleading 'Don't Leave Now I'm in Love,' and the set's most obvious hit, the breezy, disco-laced anthem '8-3-1.' The title track is the album's requisite Barry White tribute, and the album's irresistibly funky closer, 'All Over Me,' is this set's answer to \"The Line\" from 1997.\" Promis also praised two ballads: the \"gritty\" \"Didn't I\" and the \"sensitive and acoustic\" \"Wish on Me\". He also called Face Up a \"high-quality set\". According to the Huddersfield Daily Examiner, the album is a \"fine mix of uplifting dance, sugar-coated harmonies, strings, brass and songwriting that's as strong as ever.

The album was written and produced by Chumbawamba (excluding a cover of the Bee Gees' \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\"), with additional production by Neil Ferguson. Originally a continuation of the sound of predecessor Tubthumper (1997), the group scrapped the material from the album's initial recording sessions and sought to explore new sounds with WYSIWYG. The album incorporates elements of pop, dance-pop, alternative rock, and experimental music. Thematically, the album explores various aspects of pop culture that the group had been exposed to due to the success of their 1997 single \"Tubthumping\". WYSIWYG was promoted with one single: \"She's Got All the Friends That Money Can Buy\".\nWYSIWYG received polarized reviews from music critics. Some music critics praised the album's catchy hooks and references to pop culture, while others criticized the album for being dull and lacking cohesion. The album was met with some controversy due to the song \"Passenger List for Doomed Flight #1721\", a B-side to \"She's Got All the Friends That Money Can Buy\" and bonus track on the album, in which the group names off prominent public figures that they wish would disappear on an astray flight. In a stark contrast to Tubthumper, the album failed to attain any notable commercial success, failing to chart on any major music charts.

He then made the cross-county transition to Broadway, appearing in Kid Boots (1923), the Ziegfeld Follies of 1924, Ziegfeld Follies of 1925, and Good News (1927).George Olsen and his orchestra were in Eddie Cantor's 1928 Broadway hit Whoopee!, and in the 1930 movie version. In the Follies George met a singer, Ethel Shutta, who sings and dances memorably in Whoopee!, and they married, appearing together in nightclubs and on radio.

In October 1990, Jansson told John Tingwell of Drum Media about songwriting with Kilbey, \"it's a very spontaneous thing. It's not as if someone has put us together to write a hit song.

Their biggest hit was \"Smalltown Boy\", which reached No. 3 in the UK charts. In the music video Somerville plays the song's titular character, who leaves his hostile hometown for the friendlier city, reflecting Somerville's own experiences when he moved to London.Somerville left Bronski Beat in 1985 and formed The Communards with classically-trained pianist Richard Coles, who became a Church of England vicar (retired, April 2022) and broadcaster. They had several hits, including a cover version of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes' \"Don't Leave Me This Way\", which spent four weeks at No. 1 in the UK charts and became the biggest-selling single of 1986 in the UK. He also sang backing vocals on Fine Young Cannibals' version of \"Suspicious Minds\", which was a UK Top 10 hit.\nThe Communards split in 1988; Somerville began a solo career the following year. He released his debut solo album Read My Lips in November 1989, which contained three UK Top 30 hits, including a hit cover of Sylvester's disco song \"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\" and a cover of \"Comment te dire adieu?\", a duet with June Miles-Kingston, which reached number 14 in the UK Singles chart. He also sang on the second Band Aid project at the end of 1989.\nIn November 1990, Somerville's greatest-hits album The Singles Collection 1984/1990 (which featured his hits with Bronski Beat and The Communards in addition to his own material) was released; it reached number 4 on the UK Album Chart. It included a reggae cover of the Bee Gees' hit song \"To Love Somebody\", which also reached the UK Top 10.

He returned in 1995 with the album Dare to Love, which included \"Heartbeat\" (a UK Top 30 hit and a No. 1 hit on the US dance chart), \"Hurt So Good\" and \"By Your Side\", though commercial success was now beginning to elude him and his contract with London Records to which he had been signed for over a decade came to an end.\n\nA new single, \"Dark Sky\", was released in 1997 and peaked at No. 66 in the UK. In the same year he provided vocals on \"The Number One Song in Heaven\" for the Sparks album Plagiarism with production by Tony Visconti.

His dance-orientated fourth solo album, Home Again, was released in 2004, again not charting.\nMay 2009 saw the release of Somerville's Suddenly Last Summer album, which contained acoustic interpretations of other people's songs.

She moved to Nashville one week before her 21st birthday, where she now resides, and worked as a background singer for a number of artists, including Bill Gaither and Amy Grant.Plumb was originally formed in 1997 as a five-piece band that consisted of Arbuckle on vocals, Joe Porter on drums, Matt Stanfield on keyboards, J.J. Plasencio on bass guitar and Stephen Leiweke on guitar, with name, Plumb, coming from the Suzanne Vega song \"My Favorite Plum\". Following Silvertone Records affiliate Essential Records mainstream alternative radio success with its debut artist Jars of Clay in 1995, the label signed Plumb as its second artist. When Arbuckle was urged to write, she turned to Matt Bronleewe\u2014an original member of Jars of Clay who happened to be her next-door neighbor\u2014and the two hit it off. The debut album, Plumb, was released in 1997. Plumb has said subsequently that the addition of the letter \"B\" to the end was the idea of her producer Matt Bronleewe and, in her mind, also represents Bronleewe's important contribution to her sound.In 1999, Plumb released a second studio album, Candycoatedwaterdrops, which won the 2000 Gospel Music Association Dove Award for \"Modern Rock Album of the Year\". Three tracks from it were later covered by other artists; \"Stranded\" and \"Here with Me\" by Jennifer Paige and, in 2001, \"Damaged\" by Plummet. Though the album won the DOVE Award for Best Modern Rock Album in 2000, and saw strong radio success with the single \"God-Shaped Hole\", the subject matter and approach of much of Plumb's music was often considered too dark and taboo for the mainstream Christian marketplace. Plumb's tendency to write songs about deeply personal issues, such as international hit \"Cut\" which addressed cutting, and \"Damaged\" which addressed a girl coping with being molested as a child, led to more enthusiastic reception by fans of alternative and dance music. Fueling the break from contemporary Christian music, \"Cut\" was also used prominently during a pivotal scene in the storyline of The Vampire Diaries in the 10th episode of season 1, \"The Turning Point\". Later in 1999, all band members left the band, and since that time Plumb became a solo project of Tiffany Arbuckle.\nPlumb considered leaving the music industry after the 2000 album, but changed her mind after receiving a note from a fan a few hours before what she thought to be her final concert. The letter was about her song \"Damaged\" about a girl coping with being molested as a child. The note said \"Whatever you do, I just want you to never forget that you have changed someone's life,\" which inspired Plumb to remain in the music industry. She signed to Curb Records in 2003, releasing the album Beautiful Lumps of Coal on March 25, 2003. The lead single, \"Real\", peaked at No. 41 on the UK Singles Chart. Her next album, Chaotic Resolve, entered the Billboard 200 album chart at No. 177 on March 9, 2006. \"Better\" reached No. 1 on the U.S. Christian airplay chart. The Bronleewe & Bose remix of her follow-up \"Cut\", hit No. 1 on SiriusXM's dance hits channel BPM, and No. 5 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart.Shortly after the birth of her second child, Plumb recorded her fifth album, Blink, as a collection of lullaby inspired songs. It was released on October 9, 2007, immediately becoming one of her best selling and most enduring albums to date. Lead single \"In My Arms\" was used in conjunction with key plot narratives for both Vampire Diaries and One Tree Hill, and became Plumb's biggest international hit to date, selling close to half a million singles in both the United States and Russia. \"In My Arms\" received remixes by Kaskade, Scotty K, Bronleewe & Bose, Gomi, and Bimbo Jones, with the latter reaching the No. 3 spot on the Billboard Dance chart.On May 19, 2009, Curb Records announced that it would release a career-spanning greatest hits album, Beautiful History, which was released later in the year and included several new songs. The first single from Beautiful History, \"Hang On\", reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2009 and reached the top spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in 2010.\nPlumb returned to the studio in 2010 with longtime producer and co-writer Matt Bronleewe to begin work on what would become her 6th studio album, while also changing management and signing with alternative boutique firm Street Talk Media. The debut single from the project, \"Drifting\", a co-penned duet with longtime friend Dan Haseltine (of Jars of Clay), spread quickly across Christian rock radio. The second single, \"Need You Now (How Many Times)\", went to contemporary Christian music radio in early 2012 and has become Plumb's most successful single to date in that market, rising to number to No. 1 on multiple radio and iTunes charts in both the United States and Canada by year's end. The single has remained in regular rotation nationwide for well over a year, selling close to 300,000 singles on iTunes to date, and is BDS certified at over 100,000 radio spins. The album Need You Now was released worldwide in February 2013, charting at a career-best No. 56 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 2 on Christian album charts. The album received five Dove Award nominations including Song of the Year and Contemporary/Pop Album of the Year. With her children now all at least grade school age, and with the massive success of Need You Now, 2012 and 2013 saw the most aggressive touring of her entire career, playing major festivals throughout 2012 and 2013, embarking on her first and largely sold-out headlining tour in the fall of 2013, and joining the massive Winterjam arena tour for November 2013-14.Plumb released her seventh studio album, Exhale, on May 4, 2015.Plumb left Curb Records in early 2017 to form her own label, Plumb Music, and released her first single \"God Help Me\" in July 2017. The song was one of six tracks included on the EP God Help Me in late 2017. She followed it up with the album Beautifully Broken in June 2018 on Centricity Music.Following the No. 1 chart successes of \"In My Arms\", \"Hang On\", and \"Cut\", Plumb has been increasingly sought-after in the dance and electronic world. In 2011, she collaborated with trance DJ Paul Van Dyk on \"I Don't Deserve You\", playing several shows with Van Dyk, and filming a music video together in middle Tennessee.

{"id": "264_861", "question": "What music label is Time Together represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27485", "text": "Various readings of what the situation in Words and Music might represent have emerged from critical studies of the work:\n\nVivian Mercier treats the three characters as separate beings, Croak being an \"old man who shuffles in\" asking Words and Music to be friends.\nEugene Webb suggests that \"Croak is the name the dialogue directions give to the conscious self of the artist\".\nCharles Lyons says that \"[i]n Words and Music Beckett provides three characters who seem to represent different psychic functions of a single consciousness \u2026 [however] Beckett does not integrate them into the image of a specific, whole person.\" Also a number of times Lyons hints at the autobiographical nature of the piece though without providing any real evidence. It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

New vocalist in place, Persian Risk issued the now highly collectible \"Calling For You\" b/w \"Chase the Dragon\" 7\" single in 1981, before sacking Dave Bell's replacement, Alex Lohfink, and soldiering on as a four-piece.  The band made further headway by contributing the aforementioned \"Calling For You\" to  the \"Heavy Metal Heroes Vol. 2\" compilation album (Heavy Metal Records, 1982) and a new cut, \"50.000 Stallions\", to the 60 Minutes Plus cassette compilation (Neat Records, 1982), also issued on vinyl as All Hell Let Loose by Neat in conjunction with Italy's Base Records label in 1983. Adding to their tally, the band followed it up with the \"Ridin' High\" b/w \"Hurt You\" single through Neat, which earned Risk their strongest reviews yet.It would turn out to be the final recording with drummer Razz who was sacked in late 1983. He was briefly superseded by Dixie Lee (ex-Lone Star, Wild Horses) before a more permanent replacement was a found in Steve Hopgood (ex-Chinatown, Shy). The band also added a new second guitarist, Graham Bath (ex-Sphinx). Persian Risk were dealt a significant blow when founding member Phil Campbell successfully auditioned for Mot\u00f6rhead, who would tap his old band for the support slot on their 1984 UK tour. Campbell's successor was Phil Vokins (ex-Tyrant, Wrathchild).  Risk also signed a new record deal with London-based Zebra Records and issued the Too Different 12\" EP in 1984 which saw the band temper their raw approach in favor of a somewhat more polished sound.That same year, Persian Risk made their one and only national UK TV appearance when the band performed three songs \u2013 \"Women In Rock\", \"Rise Up\", and \"Too Different\" \u2013 on Channel 4's ECT program. All three songs would later feature on their Rise Up album, which was released in 1986 on Metal Masters. By that time, the band had already disintegrated, the result of mounting frustration after years of hard work and failing to get that elusive big break.  Nick Hughes exited to join Idol Rich, drummer Steve Hopgood co-founded Wild! (and later joined Paul Di'Anno's Battlezone and Killers, as well as an early version of Jagged Edge), while Carl Sentance stepped in with Tokyo Blade on their 1986 European tour; he was also brought in as a guest vocalist by fellow Welsh act Tredegar for their 1986 debut album. Graham Bath, too, would later serve a stint with the DiAnno fronted Battlezone and Killers.\nIn February 2012, vocalist Carl Sentance announced on his Facebook page that he had recorded seven new songs, and re-cut four old Persian Risk tracks, for inclusion on a new Persian Risk album, albeit without any of the original members involved. The participation of Deep Purple keyboardist Don Airey and former Thunder bassist Chris Childs was confirmed by Sentance.In a 29 July 2012 posting on the band's Facebook page, an August release was announced for the new album, entitled Once A King. On it, Sentance, Airey and Childs are joined by bassist Alex Meadows, drummer Tim Brown and the guitar duo of Danny Willson and Howie G.  The above-mentioned album was released in October 2012; a limited edition vinyl version was issued by German label High Roller Records.The new Persian Risk played the \"Hard Rock Hell\" festival in Wales on 29 November 2012, with a line-up consisting of Sentance, Brown, Howie G. and former Blaze bassist Wayne Banks.

Rolling Stone magazine dubbed the Holy Modal Rounders \"one of rock's greatest cult bands.\" The Seattle Times said \"in the subculture of obscure music groups, the Rounders may be in a class of their own for deficiency of fame as well as longevity. For more than 40 years, this freakadelic folk-rock band... had lasting influence on fans wild and crazy enough to be in on the acquired-taste secret of their art.\" Writing for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger called the band \"almost the very definition of a cult act... Their audience was small because their music was too strange, idiosyncratic, and at times downright dissonant for mainstream listeners to abide.\"The band's frequent drug use as well as Stampfel and Weber's creative differences also hindered a breakthrough. Peter Stampfel reflected that \"there was just too much drugs, alcohol, and bad attitude in the band\" to \"capitalize on our positive aspects.\" NPR noted that the band exhibited \"self-destructive behavior\" that led to an early breakup and an inability to capitalize on the inclusion of \"Bird Song\" on Easy Rider's commercially successful soundtrack. Dave Van Ronk thought similarly: \"that was their moment right there. If they had been able to capitalize on [Easy Rider], they would have been two very very wealthy men. But somehow or another it just didn't happen.\" The band's former road manager Jack Gallagher recalled in the early 2000s that \"managing them was like herding snakes\" but put the band's lack of success more squarely on Weber, questioning whether Weber would even complete the band's current tour and saying that Weber \"never crashes until the money gets real good.\"Despite the band's lack of critical and commercial success during their initial run in the 1960s and 1970s, they have since earned significant praise, in particular for their groundbreaking reworking of 1920s and 1930s folk music. While the Rounders famously were the first to use \"psychedelic\" in popular music, music journalist Greil Marcus also used the Holy Modal Rounders as the earliest example of old American music being reinvented with modern aesthetics, commenting that they were \"incapable of taking anything seriously, but nevertheless [got] to the bottom of folk songs other people sang as if they were obvious.\" The band has frequently been lumped into what Marcus coined as \"old weird America,\" which refers to the type of music Bob Dylan recorded for The Basement Tapes. Michael Simmons also noted the band's trail-blazing aesthetics, saying that \"the story of the Rounders is one of the grand secret histories of 20th-century American music. If music history is often a game of Who Came First?, then the Rounders can be said to be the first psychedelic hippie freak band and the first aggressively anti-purist folkies, making them a crucial missing link between early- and late-20th-century pop.\" The band's first two albums have been called early forerunners of the genre freak folk, with music critic Robert Christgau commenting \"freak folk started here.\" The band's two psychedelic albums are also of historical significance, with The New York Times saying that they \"still stand as extreme examples of acid-tinged folk music.\"Writing for New Haven Independent, Eleanor Polak discussed how the band had not just had significant influence, but that they had also inspired \"countless other musicians to take deep dives into American folk music to find the dark and weird within.\" Music critic Eric Weisbard, writing for  Spin in 1999, commented that after the band helped the folk scene rediscover many great \"blues and Appalachian singers\" in the 1960s, \"it's time the tables were turned--it's time for the rediscovery of the Holy Modal Rounders.\" Stampfel in particular was singled out for praise, with Weisbard declaring \"Stampfel has become to roots music what Jon Langford is to  punk: the patron saint of lost causes and good times in spite of them.\" Robert Christgau had similar high praise, believing that the Holy Modal Rounders, like Bob Dylan, \"greatly transcend\" the New York folk scene they began in and that \"next to Bob Dylan, Stampfel is the closest thing to a genius\" to come out of the 1960s folk revival. Christgau also praised Weber, calling him an \"ace guitarist\" who \"can just not give a fuck while remaining both charming and musical.\" Jason Weiss observed that \"from the start, [Weber] was recognized for his technique and divine spontaneity he brought to old-time music.\" The New York Times also noted Weber's \"mastery of traditional guitar styles.\"Rounder Records was named partially as a tribute to the Holy Modal Rounders. The label would release several of the band's studio albums after its formation in 1970. In 2008, the Holy Modal Rounders were inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame for their long stay in the state and their influence on the Portland music scene.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She performed three songs for executives of Sony Music Colombia, who were impressed enough to sign her, at the age of 13, to record three albums, which were Magia, Peligro and Pies Descalzos.The low-budget Magia was put in almost three months of pre-production, which involved choreography of live performances for the album, singing lessons for Shakira, and arranging the songs. The concept of the music still reflected her personality, despite the fact that it was managed by the record label. The tracks deal with emotions of a person's first time falling in love, and range from a love poem (\"Sue\u00f1os\") to a celebration of dance (\"Esta noche voy contigo\"). These were influenced from experiences with males such as her ex-boyfriend Oscar Pardo, stories told by her father, and dreams of living on the coast. In the book Shakira: Woman Full of Grace, Ximena Diego wrote that the album \"demonstrated her [Shakira's] indisputable potential.\"Magia is a collection of songs written by Shakira between the ages of 8 and 12, and mainly consists of pop ballads.

After moving to New York City, Clarke did one-man performance art shows. Although believing rock bands to be less artistic, he was persuaded to reform a band, which he named Warrior Soul after a line in a George S. Patton docudrama.The band began to play in New York City in 1987, and soon came to the attention of Geffen, who signed the band. Geffen directed Clarke to shed his hired band and get new players. Clarke insisted on keeping Pete McClanahan as his bass player, and recruited guitarist John Ricco and former Killing Joke drummer Paul Ferguson.In 1990, Warrior Soul released their first album, Last Decade Dead Century. AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia compared it to Nirvana's Nevermind, saying that although comparable success eluded Warrior Soul, it explored similar themes.  Rivadavia speculated that the nihilism of Nevermind may have resonated more with Generation X.1991 saw Ferguson replaced on drums by Mark Evans, and the band's second album Drugs, God and the New Republic released, which took their anarchist leanings even further. A nationwide support tour with Queensr\u00ffche (with whom they shared management from the Q Prime agency) followed.The following year saw the release of the band's third album, 1992's Salutations from the Ghetto Nation, and Clarke's relationship with Geffen sour. Clarke's interviews became increasingly bitter, often focusing on the band's record label, whom he accused of ignoring the group's potential. Eventually, Clarke resorted to an all-out war, telling all that the band's fourth release, 1993's Chill Pill had been botched on purpose in order to fulfill the band's contract. The ploy seemed to work, and by early 1994 Warrior Soul were dropped by Geffen.A number of lineup changes ensued. Longtime guitarist John Ricco was ousted, replaced by two guitarists:  Alexander Arundel (aka X-Factor aka Gene Poole ) and Chris Moffet (former Cycle Sluts from Hell lead guitarist). Not long after, Mark Evans and Chris Moffet departed. At that time former Nuclear Assault/Cities/Cycle Sluts from Hell drummer Scott Duboys joined the band. The line-up now consisted of Clarke, Arundel, McClanahan and Duboys. Clarke sought to reinvent Warrior Soul as self-appointed cyberpunks for their fifth album, 1994's The Space Age Playboys, released on the independent Futurist label. At this time adding old friend and collaborator, Peter Jay on rhythm guitar. While touring in support of the album, Warrior Soul headlined the 1995 Kerrang! UK tour, as well as performing at the 1995 Dynamo Open Air Festival, and also at the 1995 Donnington Monsters of Rock concert.\nAfter the performance of their last live show in September 1995, Arundel, Duboys, and longtime bassist McClanahan quit the band, leading in short order to Clarke's decision to retire the band later that year.\nIn 1996, Odds & Ends was released as a collection of demos recorded on an eight-track with Arundel, and leftover material that was originally intended for release on Elektra Records.\nThe \"classic\" lineup of Clarke, Ricco, McClanahan, and Evans later reunited for a short tour and to go in the studio to re-record twelve of the bands' songs, released on Dream Catcher Records as Classics in 2000.  All Warrior Soul albums were remastered and re-released on CD and MP3 in 2006 and 2009, including with bonus material (mostly live songs originally released as b-sides).  The first three albums were also re-released on vinyl in 2009.\nClarke says many of their songs are politically based, such as \"Blown Away\", \"Superpower Dreamland\", \"In Conclusion\", and \"Children of the Winter\". Clarke describes the band's sound as \"acid punk\", particularly their The Space Age Playboys album.\nDrummer Mark Evans was murdered in London, England, in 2005.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At that point Mesirow and Popieluch were living in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles and the act was described as \"LA-based.\"  Mesirow was at the time working in the studio of artist Mike Kelley. Glasser's live shows featured performances by the dance troupe Body City and Mesirow wore custom outfits by local designer Ida Falck \u00d8ien. According to the LA Weekly, \"'Apply' and its sister songs \u2014 the swooning 'Learn,' haunted shuffler 'Glad' or the Kate Bush\u2013meets-Cluster 'Tremel' \u2014 do sport the built-in intimacy common to good bedroom recordings, but they also possess hints of grandiose and mercurial qualities.\"The Apply EP was followed over a year later by Glasser's first full-length studio album, Ring, co-produced by Swedish producer Van Rivers and the Subliminal Kid. According to Pitchfork, \"there isn't an easy descriptor for Glasser's sound-- she incorporates bits of tropical pop, tribal percussion, and a couple of different strains of electronic music. Her songs sidestep traditionally linear arrangements for a more open, circular approach-- they kind of swoosh around without pausing at verse-chorus intersections.\"Glasser's second album, Interiors, came out in 2013. The album was inspired, according to Mesirow, by Dutch architect and theorist Rem Koolhaas' 1978 book Delirious New York. The album's themes and sounds reflected the artist's move from Los Angeles to downtown Manhattan. \"The interiors Glasser explores,\" wrote Pitchfork, \"most compellingly are, it won't surprise you at this point to learn, the ones within human beings. She applies the same ruthless precision to these ostensibly messier subjects, so that video selection \"Design\", an examination of physical desire that wields human breaths as percussion, is crystalline enough for a posh gallery.

Pitchfork commended the project for engaging \"directly with the thorniness of queer intimacy, the complications that arise when queer people seek each other out to dance, to flirt, and to fuck each other.\"In 2022, Glasser again resurfaced with a single titled New Scars, released on One Little Independent Records.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This era of the Dwarves is captured on Lick It (the psychedelic years 83-86) a 34 track collection put out by Recess records in 1999.\nThe band became notorious for self-mutilation, on-stage sex, and taking hard drugs. Their live shows would often only last around fifteen minutes, occasionally cut short due to injury caused by spectators. The band's sound began to evolve beyond its early garage roots with their second (nine-minute long) LP, Toolin' for a Warm Teabag, which saw the band drifting towards a more truculent punk rock sound, influenced by GG Allin. Recess records issued Free Cocaine 86\u201388 in 1999, a 39-song collection that shows the band's transition to the nihilistic style that took them to the Sub Pop era. The band released Blood Guts & Pussy on Sub Pop in 1990. By this time the Dwarves had dropped their early psychedelic sensibilities and morphed into a hardcore punk band. The Blood Guts & Pussy LP was followed up by EP Lucifer's Crank released by No.6 Records, as well as another Sub Pop LP, the metal-punk Thank Heaven For Little Girls, both in 1991.In 1993 the band issued a press release stating their guitarist HeWhoCannotBeNamed had been stabbed to death in Philadelphia.

The Dwarves reformed in 1997, releasing The Dwarves Are Young and Good Looking (described by Adam Bregman of AllMusic as \"the beginning of a new Dwarves...one that plays real songs, had a set list, and left the club unbloodied\"), and its 2000 followup The Dwarves Come Clean.In 2004 the band released The Dwarves Must Die, its first LP for the indie label Sympathy for the Record Industry, which featured guest appearances from Dexter Holland (The Offspring), Nick Oliveri (Queens of the Stone Age), Nash Kato (Urge Overkill), and voice actor Gary Owens.

Fisher was inspired by the sudden success of 'The Tower of Shoes' in an old Quonset hut in a non-retail industrial area of Sacramento, California, that drew crowds by advertising that no matter what brand, style or size of shoes a woman could want it was at The Tower of Shoes. And knowing that even Macy's, the biggest Levi's customer, was constantly running out of the best selling Levi's sizes, and colors, Fisher asked Haas to let him copy The Tower of Shoes' business model and apply it to Levi's products. Haas referred Fisher to Bud Robinson, his Director of Advertising, for what Haas assumed would be a quick refusal; but instead Robinson and Fisher carefully worked out a legal test plan for what was to become The Gap (named by Don's wife Doris Fisher). The name was a reference to the \"generation gap\".Fisher agreed to stock only Levi's apparel in every style and size, all grouped by size, and Levi's guaranteed The Gap to be never out of stock by overnight replenishment from Levi's San Jose, California warehouse. And finally, Robinson offered to pay 50% of The Gap's radio advertising upfront and avoided antitrust laws by offering the same marketing package to any store that agreed to sell nothing but Levi's products.\nFisher opened the first Gap store near City College on Ocean Avenue in Ingleside, San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its only merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records to attract teen customers.\nIn 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private label merchandise.In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Mickey Drexler. However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales. Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.\nIn 2007, Gap announced that it would \"focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline\". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis. He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units. The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic. In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets. In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 \"World's Most Ethical Companies\".In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.

Less than two months later, the company announced that the total number of stores to be closed by 2024 was 350. (220 Gap stores and 130 Banana Republic stores.) The original plan of the company was to close only 90 stores, however, they expanded the number as a consequence of the financial effects caused by the pandemic restrictions. Most of the stores closed were ones set in malls.\nIn November 2020, Gap Inc. partnered with Afterpay. This collaboration was planned to improve the digital shopping experience.In February 2021, Gap Inc. announced a $140 million investment to build an 850,000 square foot distribution center in Longview, Texas, because it forecasts that its online business will double over the next two years.

In addition to hiring 1,100 employees to meet the demands of market share growth and peak season, Gap partnered with AHS to implement an automated order fulfillment system.\nIn September 2022, the company announced it would end its partnership with Kanye West. Several days later, Gap announced it would cut some 500 corporate positions in its San Francisco and New York offices. The firm also cut corporate jobs in Asia. Gap announced that the layoffs were unrelated to the decision to end its partnership with West. Gap announced more layoffs in April 2023.Gap Inc. has decided to completely leave Russia, as well as close all stores in the country, due to the unpopularity of the brand in Russia.In 2023, Gap launched a programme to support emerging designers in their early stages of development.
