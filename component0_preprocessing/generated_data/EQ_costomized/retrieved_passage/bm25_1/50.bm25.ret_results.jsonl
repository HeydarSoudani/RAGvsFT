Taking bribery and corruption as its themes, the play was eagerly anticipated by Sovremennik and its followers, but it was not a straightforward social critique.

Wouldn't it be more intriguing to try and penetrate under the skin of these people, learn how their special kind of morality works, expose the logic of their excuses?\" Ostrovsky loathed tendentious drama and shied didacticism. \"To pronounce a clever and honest word is not such a big deal, lots of them have been said and written.

The book was first published in 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company; it was republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, and that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality. He criticizes Sigmund Freud and argues that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions. He maintains that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning, that early puberty and early masturbation are important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and that a majority of adults are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He criticizes psychotherapeutic attempts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality and argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.\nThe book was controversial and received many negative reviews. It was criticized for Tripp's rambling style, sexism, views about the biological basis of male and female sexual behavior, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, who criticized Tripp's dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, accused him of being biased in favor of homosexuality, charged that he mistakenly claimed that gay men tend to have a larger than average penis size, and objected to his discussion of attempts to change homosexuality through psychotherapy. Tripp himself believed that The Homosexual Matrix had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, the book was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality.

In this setting, a Florentine trader meets a shipwrecked stranger, who introduces himself as Tito Melema, a young Italianate-Greek scholar. Tito becomes acquainted with several other Florentines, including Nello the barber and a young girl named Tessa. He is also introduced to a blind scholar named Bardo de' Bardi, and his daughter Romola. As Tito becomes settled in Florence, assisting Bardo with classical studies, he falls in love with Romola. However, Tessa falls in love with Tito, and the two are \"married\" in a mock ceremony.\nTito learns from Fra Luca, a Dominican friar, that his adoptive father has been forced into slavery and is asking for assistance. Tito introspects, comparing filial duty to his new ambitions in Florence, and decides that it would be futile to attempt to rescue his adoptive father. This paves the way for Romola and Tito to marry. Fra Luca shortly thereafter falls ill and before his death he speaks to his estranged sister, Romola. Ignorant of Romola's plans, Fra Luca warns her of a vision foretelling a marriage between her and a mysterious stranger who will bring pain to her and her father. After Fra Luca's death, Tito dismisses the warning and advises Romola to trust him. Tito and Romola become betrothed at the end of Carnival, to be married at Easter after Tito returns from a visit to Rome.\n\nThe novel then skips ahead to November 1494, more than eighteen months after the marriage. In that time, the French-Italian Wars have seen Florence enter uneasy times. Girolamo Savonarola preaches to Florentines about ridding the Church and the city of scourge and corruption, and drums up support for the new republican government. Piero de' Medici, Lorenzo de' Medici's son and successor to the lordship of Florence, has been driven from the city for his ignominious surrender to the invading French king, Charles VIII. The Medici palace is looted and the Medici family formally exiled from the city. In this setting, Tito, now a valued member of Florentine society, participates in the reception for the French invaders. Tito encounters an escaped prisoner, who turns out to be his adopted father, Baldassarre. Panicked and somewhat ashamed of his earlier inaction, Tito denies knowing the escaped prisoner and calls him a madman. Baldassarre escapes into the Duomo, where he swears revenge on his unfilial adoptive son. Growing ever more fearful, Tito plans to leave Florence. To do this, he betrays his late father-in-law, Bardo, who died some months earlier, by selling the late scholar's library. This reveals to Romola the true nature of her husband's character. She secretly leaves Tito and Florence, but is persuaded by Savonarola to return to fulfil her obligations to her marriage and her fellow Florentines. Nevertheless, the love between Romola and Tito has gone.\nAgain the action of the novel moves forward, from Christmas 1494 to October 1496. In that time, Florence has endured political upheaval, warfare and famine. Religious fervour has swept through Florence under the leadership of Savonarola, culminating in the Bonfire of the vanities. The League of Venice has declared war on the French king and his Italian ally, Florence. Starvation and disease run rampant through the city. Romola, now a supporter of Savonarola, helps the poor and sick where she can. Meanwhile, Tito is embroiled in a complex game of political manoeuvring and duplicitous allegiances in the new Florentine government. Mirroring this, he has escaped attempts by Baldassarre to both kill and expose him, and maintains a secret marriage to Tessa, with whom he has fathered two children. Romola becomes defiant of Tito, and the two manoeuvre to thwart each other's plans. Romola meets an enfeebled Baldassarre, who reveals Tito's past and leads her to Tessa.\nPolitical turmoil erupts in Florence. Five supporters of the Medici family are sentenced to death, including Romola's godfather, Bernardo del Nero. She learns that Tito has played a role in their arrest. Romola pleads with Savonarola to intervene, but he refuses. Romola's faith in Savonarola and Florence is shaken, and once again she leaves the city. Meanwhile, Florence is under papal pressure to expel Savonarola. His arrest is effected by rioters, who then turn their attention to several of the city's political elite. Tito becomes a target of the rioters, but he escapes the mob by diving into the Arno River. However, upon leaving the river, Tito is killed by Baldassarre.\nRomola makes her way to the coast. Emulating Gostanza in Boccaccio's Decameron (V, 2), she drifts out to sea in a small boat to die. However, the boat takes her to a small village affected by the Plague, and she helps the survivors. Romola's experience gives her a new purpose in life and she returns to Florence. Savonarola is tried for heresy and burned at the stake, but for Romola his influence remains inspiring. Romola takes care of Tessa and her two children, with the help of her older cousin. The story ends with Romola imparting advice to Tessa's son, based on her own experiences and the influences in her life.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Because of this familiarity, Erdrich chose to set her novel in this part region, telling the story of her family\u2019s people, the Turtle Mountain Chippewa. She hoped that in telling this story she could deepen the understanding that the public had of Native Americans, saying that \u201dthere's this humanity that's been lost in the public perception about Native American people.\u201d The series reinforces the deeper emotional aspects of the Ojibwe, and reminds the reader of their prevailing lineage.Erdrich's larger vision was to give readers a more in depth look into native families. She wanted to make accessing real native lives easier giving children a more well rounded view. The prevailing portrayal of Native Americans in American literature, especially children's books, primarily view natives as people who just went away, and were always going to. Viewing them through their perspective shows that they are people who have survived.

It appears that Judah HaHasid most likely was not the sole author of the Sefer Hasidim. It has been said that Samuel he-\u1e24asid is the author of the first 26 sections. In its present form the book contains, according to G\u00fcdemann, three revisions of the same original work, of which Judah is undoubtedly the author; and both the contents and language of the book indicate that it originated in Germany. Important additions were made also by Judah's pupil Eleazar Ro\u1e33ea\u1e25, for which reason the authorship of the whole work has sometimes been ascribed to him. On account of the fact that collectors and copyists used varying recensions, sometimes the same passage occurs two or three times in different parts of the Sefer \u1e24asidim. Some fragments of other books are inserted.\nThis Hebrew book originated between the late 12th and early 13th centuries in the Rhineland, shortly after the Second Crusade. After this time, it circulated widely. It influenced the distinctive religious practices and Hebrew literary style of Jews in Ashkenaz and also shaped the discourse about Jewish ethics in medieval Europe and beyond.The book has been printed many times since 1538.According to Ivan Marcus, no original text of the Sefer Hasidim ever existed.\nIt is therefore no surprise, then, that thirty-seven manuscripts that include texts from the Sefer Hasidim have been identified. Seventeen of these manuscripts are available online. Some manuscripts are more extensive than others. Two versions of the book are best known: one printed in Bologna and another that was found in Parma. An edition by Jehuda Wistinetzki based on the most complete source, the Parma manuscript, was published by the Mekitzei Nirdamim Society in 1891 and reprinted in 1955. Recently Otzar haPoskim Institute has published an elaborate version with numerous commentaries.\nSome studies address subjects included within Sefer Hasidim. These include the subject of Jewish travel, and the attitude toward music. Entertainment and socializing especially among young people has been denigrated by some significant works of Jewish scholarship and law (including Sefer Hasidim and Shulkhan Arukh) as frivolity and a distraction from the Torah.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the book, Loewen prioritized Native American history and the Spanish colonization of the Americas over that of other European colonization.\nLoewen's book voices two major complaints about historical markers in the United States. The first deals with historical markers established in the Southern United States that attempt to whitewash the history of slavery and the period of Reconstruction. Many of these markers were established between 1890 and 1920, the nadir of American race relations. Most were placed by organizations with pro-Confederate agendas and reflect the racism of the early 20th century. While some markers have been altered in the last 40 years as a result of civil rights progress, many have not, especially those at American Civil War battle sites and in the South.\nLoewen's second major complaint deals with the treatment of Native Americans, who are often neglected and omitted in the telling of American history.

As the title suggests, it commemorates and eulogises the life and actions of the Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace who lived a century and a half earlier. The poem is historically inaccurate, and mentions several events that never happened.

The first mention of Blind Harry as the work's author was made by John Mair in his 1521 work Historia Majoris Britanniae, tam Angliae quam Scotiae. It was later republished in the late 18th century by the poet William Hamilton, in contemporary English.

Additionally, Chaucer drew on John Gower's Confessio Amantis and the biblical story of Jephtha for inspiration. \nAlthough difficult to date like most of Chaucer's tales, the Physician's tale is usually regarded as an early work of Chaucer-- probably written before much of the rest of the Canterbury Tales. Some scholars believe it may have originally been intended for Chaucer's poem The Legend of Good Women instead. The long digression on governesses possibly alludes to a historical event and may serve to date it. In 1386, Elizabeth, the daughter of John of Gaunt, eloped to France with John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. Elizabeth's governess was Katherine Swynford, who was also Gaunt's mistress and later wife. Chaucer's words on the virtues of governesses were potentially influenced by this scandal.The Physician's Tale is widely considered by Chaucerian scholars to be a failure, largely due to its convoluted moral message. However, the story is still considered one of the moral tales, along with the Parson's Tale and the Knight's Tale. Additionally, the Physician's Tale is considered part of the Children's Cluster, a group of tales centered around child characters or themes of childhood. Other tales in this cluster are the Prioress's Tale and the Pardoner's Tale.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Waugh, wrote Oldmeadow, \"was intent on elaborating a work outrageous not only to Catholic but to ordinary standards of modesty\". Waugh made no public rebuttal of these charges; an open letter to the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster was prepared, but on the advice of Waugh's friends was not sent.The novel has been published in the United Kingdom by Penguin Classics (ISBN 9780141183985), and in the U.S.A. by Back Bay Books (ISBN 0316917338).", "hasanswer": true}]}

A review in Reference & Research Book News commented that participants in the Rajneesh movement created \"adults like Guest who are marked by the neglect suffered in a childhood among the completely self-absorbed\". Kirkus Reviews described the book as \"a rightly disturbing record of malignant child neglect by people who sought a heaven, but made a hell\". My Life in Orange was highlighted among Kirkus Reviews \"Best books for reading groups\". In his review of the book for M2 Best Books, Peter Haswell concluded: \"A thoroughly enjoyable read and a fascinating insight into the workings of a commune along with the people, their beliefs and their attitudes. Both amusing and sad. Pretty much something for everyone.\"\n\nThe book received a favorable review in New Statesman, and William Leith wrote: \"This is an excellent study of what happens when a charismatic leader comes into contact with a group of rudderless, dispirited people. They follow him blindly. They let him get away with anything.\" Montagu Curzon of The Spectator wrote that \"Guest makes an astonishingly mature debut (he is 27) and has the rare ability to describe childhood as a small child lives it; accepting, helpless, curious.\" Lois Kendall gave the book a positive review in Cultic Studies Review, and wrote: \"The book is deep, yet light and readable, both for those who have had similar life experiences and who, I am sure, will find solace in this book, and for those with no such personal experience, who will find the narrative fascinating.\" Publishers Weekly characterized My Life in Orange as \"Honest and vivid, this is an absorbing book about survival and good intentions gone awry.\" Gillian Engberg of Booklist called the book a \"stirring memoir\", and wrote: \"Guest writes with a reporter's sense of economy and restraint, letting absurd, even shocking details speak for themselves.\" Christopher Hart gave the book a positive review in The Sunday Times, and wrote: \"Tim Guest\u2019s extraordinary account of his childhood in the communes of Bhagwan, the notorious Indian guru, is a survivor\u2019s tale, poignant, funny and wise.\"A review in The Daily Telegraph commented that \"the main failure of Guest's otherwise excellent book is the absence of character: even his mother comes across rather as a history than a personality.\" \"My Life in Orange, though slightly patchwork in its construction, is an absorbing piece of writing, all the more compelling for begging as many questions as it answers and for the author's refusal to ask for pity,\" wrote Geraldine Bedell in a review of the book in The Observer. Director of the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, Christopher Cook, characterized My Life in Orange as \"the most extraordinary account of his [Tim Guest's] childhood and the bravest writing I've read in ages\". Sudipta Datta of the Indian Express described the book as \"a postcard from the past that the Osho ashram may not rave about.\" Datta noted though that after having been angry with his mother and Rajneesh, Guest had reconciled with his family, reclaimed his childhood and come to see Rajneesh as \"a loveable rogue who got away with doing his own thing\". Catherine A. Powers of The Boston Globe characterized the book as a \"moving, superbly written account of growing up in the midst of ... cruel madness\". Michael E. Young of The Dallas Morning News gave the book a favorable review, and wrote: \"The book offers a glimpse into the thoughts of the followers, and examines the fine line between spirituality and insanity, between religion and cult.\" Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times characterized the book as \"an intriguing and often humorous mix of straightforward 1980s nostalgia and cult delusion\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

French was already famous for his 1874 The Minute Man statue in Concord, Massachusetts, and other works such as his 1884 John Harvard statue. He was also the personal choice of Bacon, who had already been collaborating with him for nearly 25 years. French resigned his chairmanship of the Fine Arts Commission in Washington, D.C. \u2014 a group closely affiliated with the memorial's design and creation \u2014 and commenced work in December.\n\nFrench had already created (1909\u20131912) a major memorial statue of Lincoln\u2014this one standing\u2014for the Nebraska State Capitol (Abraham Lincoln, 1912) in Lincoln, Nebraska. His previous studies of Lincoln\u2014which included biographies, photographs, and a life mask of Lincoln by Leonard Volk done in 1860\u2014had prepared him for the challenging task of the larger statue. He and Bacon decided that a large seated figure would be most appropriate for the national memorial. French started with a small clay study and subsequently created several plaster models, making subtle changes in the figure's pose or setting. He placed Lincoln not in an ordinary 19th-century seat but in a classical chair, including fasces, a Roman symbol of authority, to convey that the subject was an eminence for all the ages.\n\nThree plaster models of the Lincoln statue are at French's Chesterwood Studio, a National Trust Historic Site in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, including a  plaster sketch (1915) and a six-foot plaster model (1916). The second of French's plasters, created at Chesterwood in the summer of 1916 (inscribed October 31), became the basis of the final work, which was initially envisioned as a 12-foot (3.7 m) bronze. In deciding the size of the final statue, French and Bacon took photographic enlargements of the model to the memorial under construction. Eventually, French's longtime collaborators, the firm of Piccirilli Brothers, were commissioned to do the carving of a much larger sculpture in marble from a quarry near Tate, Georgia.\nFrench's design took a year to transfer to the massive marble blocks. French provided finishing strokes in the carvers' studio in The Bronx, New York City and after the statue was assembled in the memorial on the National Mall in 1920. Lighting the statue was a particular problem. In creating the work, French had understood that a large skylight would provide direct, natural illumination from overhead, but this was not included in the final plans. The horizontal light from the east flattened Lincoln's facial features\u2014making him appear to stare blankly rather than wear a dignified expression\u2014and highlighted his shins. French considered this a disaster. In the end, an arrangement of electric lights was devised to correct this situation. The work was unveiled at the memorial's formal dedication on May 30, 1922.", "hasanswer": false}]}

These clerics were widely known as Canons Regular (in order to distinguish them from the traditional 'secular' canons who followed the older, Carolingian 'rule of Aachen'.), 'Augustinian canons', 'canons of St Augustine', 'Austin canons' or 'Black canons',  Observance of this rule was approved for members of the clergy by the Council of Lateran (1059) and another council held at Rome four years later.\nAdoption of the Rule of St Augustine subsequently spread rapidly through Western Europe.

Revizor, literally: \"Inspector\"), is a satirical play by Russian dramatist and novelist, Nikolai Gogol. Originally published in 1836, the play was revised for an 1842 edition. Based upon an anecdote allegedly recounted to Gogol by Pushkin, the play is a comedy of errors, satirizing human greed, stupidity, and the political corruption of contemporary Russia.\nThe dream-like scenes of the play, often mirroring each other, whirl in the endless vertigo of self-deception around the main character, Khlestakov (rendered in some English translations as Hlestakov), who personifies irresponsibility, light-mindedness, and absence of measure. \"He is full of meaningless movement and meaningless fermentation incarnate, on a foundation of placidly ambitious inferiority\" (D. S. Mirsky). The publication of the play led to a great outcry in the reactionary press. It took the personal intervention of Tsar Nicholas I to have the play staged, with Mikhail Shchepkin taking the role of the Mayor. Nicholas I was personally present at the play's premiere on the stage of the Alexandrinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on April 19, 1836, concluding that \"there is nothing sinister in the comedy, as it is only a cheerful mockery of bad provincial officials.\"According to D. S. Mirsky, The Government Inspector \"is not only supreme in character and dialogue \u2013 it is one of the few Russian plays constructed with unerring art from beginning to end. The great originality of its plan consisted in the absence of all love interest and of sympathetic characters. The latter feature was deeply resented by Gogol's enemies, and as a satire the play gained immensely from it. There is not a wrong word or intonation from beginning to end, and the comic tension is of a quality that even Gogol did not always have at his beck and call.\" In 2014, the play was ranked by The Telegraph as one of the 15 greatest ever written.", "hasanswer": true}]}

They moved from Machida 5 years earlier, after the massacre of their parents in their apartment complex, which was attacked and overrun by unknown assailants who ruthlessly and brutally killed almost everyone in several buildings in the complex. He has been having recurring dreams for some time, of a tattooed girl covered in blood holding a giant sword surrounded by bodies, but they are now growing more frequent. It is the day his class graduates to become investigators for The Special Mobile Investigation Forces, or Tokki, which he joined to learn about his parents' death. Later on the day of his graduation, he sees the girl from his dream wearing a police uniform. She is Sakura Rokujo, who is in the same class as him and a member of Section 2, known officially as Special Public Safety Task Force, or Tokko. Its other main members include the young prodigy Kureha Suzuka, the silent strongman Takeru Inukai and its leader Ryoko Ibuki. There are many rumors about Tokko, one of which is that they use swords to execute criminals and that body parts are often found at the crime scenes Tokko investigates. There are also rumors that they aren't even human.\nWhen Ranmaru's unit investigates another grizzly murder, a witness claims to see a demon, which was also rumored at other bloody scenes. There they encounter humans with talking human faced larva parasites growing out of them, that are impervious to guns. The demons refer to Ranmaru as having the scent of Michida and attack, before he is saved by Sakura and Tokko. She explains that they were just lesser monsters controlled to target survivors of the Michida incident. Afterwards, Ranmaru's team researches previous violent dismemberments and learns that most have witnesses claiming to see demons and that the incidents have been on the rise since Michida. Sakura soon after reveals to Ranmaru that the Machida incident was caused by the monsters, which are demons from the otherworld. Five days before the incident, a box created by ancient philosophers and alchemists was opened that connects to the otherworld, the demons that came through committed the massacre. The stronger demons are called Phantoms and grow stronger by eating humans, these are the ones Tokko are tasked with finding and killing. The holes created by the earthquakes are the gates that allow them to enter the world. It is also confirmed that the main members of Tokko aren't fully human, referring to themselves as hunters.\nRanmaru and his best friend and partner Hanazono sneak into the closed off Machida crime scene to inspect the hole. When Ranmaru disturbs the hole by dropping something in it, a demon comes out an attacks them. Tokko arrives and saves them, and explains they are all survivors of Machida and the only ones that can defeat them as they have \"awakened\" into symbionts, having Phantoms inside them that protected them during the incident. The Machida hole is getting bigger and in two years will swallow Tokyo. The box that opened the gate was broken into 108 pieces, each of which is inside a Phantom, and Tokko collects the pieces in order to close the gate. The 12th Phantom, the one controlling the human faced larva parasites, then appears. Ranmaru asks Kureha Suzuka to show him how to awaken so he can fight, even after she warns him that he might not remain himself in which case they would have to kill him. To do so she mortally wounds him and throws him into the hole. When he emerges he completes the symbiosis with a giant demon, forming his tattoos and granting him two large swords, and defeats the Phantom in one attack. When he wakes up a week later, he is transferred to Tokko. In the epilogue it is hinted that two years later the hole did in fact swallow Tokyo.\nThe story then focuses on Itsuto Araragi and his sister Mayu in 2011, who are survivors of Michida and symbiont hunters unaffiliated with Tokko. Together they hunt Phantoms and eat them to get stronger, absorbing their abilities, aiming to eventually kill them all. They accidentally save Yukino Shiraishi from committing suicide and deduce she was being controlled by a Phantom. They learn students have been going missing at her university and that there are rumors of \"demons\". There they encounter many Phantoms, learning that some humans willing become them. It is revealed this all started when Yukino discovered what she thought to be a mummy hand and took it back the university, it was in fact a Phantom hand from Machida. Her father, who works at the university, began experimenting and learned humans can become a hybrid of human and phantom by eating them and began to turn the students as well. He was the one who planted a larva in Yukino to make her commit suicide, after she saw him kill her mother. Using their newly absorbed abilities from the Phantoms at the school, Itsuto and Mayu defeat her father, with her finishes him off herself by setting their house on fire.

At the chapter house party, Jackie alleged in the article, her date led her to a bedroom where she was gang raped by several fraternity members as part of their initiation ritual. For anonymity, Erdely only used Jackie's first name and gave pseudonyms to other students discussed in the story.According to Los Angeles Times columnist Jonah Goldberg's summary of the story, on September 28, 2012, Jackie, a freshman at UVA, had a date with a Phi Kappa Psi member \"Drew\", a junior at UVA. After the date, they allegedly went to a party at his fraternity house, where he brought her to a dark bedroom upstairs and \"a heavy person jumps on top of her. A hand covers her mouth. Someone gets between her legs. Someone else kneels on her hair. And for the next three hours she's brutally raped and beaten, with Drew and another upperclassman supposedly shouting out instructions to the pledges, referring to Jackie as 'it'.\" According to Goldberg, \"It is an account of a sober, well-planned gang rape by seven fraternity pledges at the direction of two members.\"\nAfter leaving the party around 3 a.m., allegedly with bruises and blood stained clothes, Jackie called her three best friends, \"Andy\", \"Randall\" and \"Cindy\", for support. In Rolling Stone's version, Jackie's friends discouraged her from going to the hospital to protect her reputation and because Andy and Randall planned to rush fraternities and worried their association with Jackie might hurt their chances if she reported it.\nErdely wrote that Randall was no longer friends with Jackie and, \"citing his loyalty to his own frat, declined to be interviewed\".Jackie's academic performance reportedly declined, and she became socially withdrawn due to emotional distress. In May 2013, Jackie reported the sexual assault to dean and head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board, Nicole Eramo, who, according to a recap in New York magazine, offered three options: \"file a criminal complaint with the police, file a complaint with the school, or face her attackers with Eramo present to tell them how she feels\". The university would not take further action unless Jackie disclosed the names of the individuals or the fraternity involved. In September 2013, Eramo connected Jackie with Emily Renda, a UVA staff member, recent graduate and leader in the college's sexual assault support group One Less.

The work relates the tale of the young Arthur Gordon Pym, who stows away aboard a whaler called the Grampus. Various adventures and misadventures befall Pym, including shipwreck, mutiny, and cannibalism, before he is saved by the crew of the Jane Guy. Aboard this vessel, Pym and a sailor named Dirk Peters continue their adventures farther south. Docking on land, they encounter hostile, black-skinned natives before escaping back to the ocean. The novel ends abruptly as Pym and Peters continue toward the South Pole.\nThe story starts out as a fairly conventional adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange and hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from J. N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on possible autobiographical elements as well as its portrayal of race and the symbolism in the final lines of the work.\nDifficulty in finding literary success early in his short story-writing career inspired Poe to pursue writing a longer work. A few serialized installments of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket were first published in the Southern Literary Messenger, though never completed. The full novel was published in July 1838 in two volumes. Some critics responded negatively to the work for being too gruesome and for cribbing heavily from other works, while others praised its exciting adventures.

Centuries later, the Christian theologian Jerome, in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian, makes a similar reference, writing that the Consolatio was heavily based on Crantor's ancient work De Luctu (\"On Grief\"). Some have suggested that Cicero \"followed Crantor exclusively or even principally\" when composing the Consolatio, but David Scourfield repudiates this view, arguing it was more likely that Cicero's Consolatio simply agreed with Crantor rather than slavishly duplicated his work.Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, as well as the structure of Cicero's reply. From the snippets that remain of the work, it would appear that the piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her deification must both be approved of by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he writes that he will build Tullia a memorial in a well-known location. Cicero also lists a number of famous individuals who have been deified to justify his proposed apotheosis of Tullia.The only extant pieces of the Consolatio are fragments, one of which was preserved by Cicero himself in his Tusculanae Disputationes. Seven other fragments were preserved by the early Christian author Lactantius in his work Institutiones Divinae (The Divine Institutes). Lactantius used the excerpts from the Consolatio both to point out the futility of paganism, as well as to argue that pagans actually accept some tenets of Christianity without them even realizing it. Lactantius criticized what Cicero wrote, but he also applauded Cicero at times for paralleling\u2014albeit coincidentally\u2014what the Bible says. However, the lines preserved by Lactantius have been criticized due to their lack of context. MacKendrick notes that Lactantius was using \"partial quotation[s]\" in order to frame what Cicero wrote so that Lactantius could more easily refute his ideas.Another important reference to the work can be found in the aforementioned letter by Jerome addressed to Heliodorus; Jerome noted that the Consolatio contained references to \"men who showed equal fortitude in sorrow and war\", namely: Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, Cato the Elder, Quintus Gallius, Gaius Calpurnius Piso, Lucius Junius Brutus, Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur, Scaurus, Quintus Marcius Rex, Publius Licinius Crassus, and Gnaeus Aufidius Orestes, as well as members of the Metellus and Marcellus families.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The angels are supposed to protect humans, answer their petitions, solve their problems, and intercede to god for them by petitioning the god Jovah through song, especially for rain when the crops need it and the sun when it is stormy. In addition, the angels must sing to Jovah at the annual Gloria held on the Plain of Sharon, otherwise god would destroy the world. The Archangel and his consort, the Angelica, lead this mass in praise of Jovah. Archangels do not serve for life, but every twenty years Jovah selects a new Archangel.\nSamaria is divided into three regions, Gaza, Bethel and Jordana, separated by rivers. Each region has an angel hold or fortress that acts as the governing center for the region. The citizens of Gaza, the Manadavvi, are highly cultured and wealthy. The Jansai, who are calculating and greedy merchants, and run the Edori slave trade inhabit Jordana. The Edori are the wanderers and frequently become enslaved by the Jansai.\nThe Oracle has declared that the angel Gabriel is to be the next Archangel.

Rachel, an Edori slave, dislikes angels because of what they had done to her family when she was younger. Gabriel is faced with many trials having to contend with Raphael on the one hand, and his reluctant wife, who is a constant thorn-in-the-side.

Both the Allies and the Axis find themselves facing key shortages that impede their ability to win the war. The Allies lack gyroscopes capable of operating at high altitudes; thus they are losing an unacceptably high number of bombers. If they do not procure gyroscopes soon, the D-Day invasion of Normandy will need to be postponed. The Germans find themselves without high quality diamonds, which are necessary for the rocket development program at Peenem\u00fcnde.\nIronically, each side has what the other needs: the Allies control access to high quality diamonds from the Belgian Congo; the Germans have a design for a gyroscope able to operate at high altitudes. The German intelligence agency, the Nachrichtendienst, discovers that the Allies are in need of gyroscopes, and proposes an exchange, to take place in neutral territory: Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nDavid Spaulding has, in the meantime, become an invaluable spy for the Allies. His Lisbon network ferries agents and defectors back and forth from German-occupied territory. He is selected, however, to oversee the receipt of the gyroscopes \u2013 critically, he does not know that diamonds are being exchanged for the gyroscopes.\nThe Germans select the exiled industrialist Erich Rhinemann to supervise the exchange at their end. He is a clever choice because, although he is Jewish, he is committed to German victory and believes that he will be welcomed back after a German victory. Rhinemann is immensely influential and powerful in Buenos Aires.\nAlthough puzzled at his assignment away from Lisbon, Spaulding accepts his new assignment. However, there are several attempts made on his life: one occurring at an airfield in the Azores, another in New York City. While he is in New York, awaiting details on his assignment, he encounters an old flame, Leslie Jenner Hawkwood who, having drawn him away from his apartment, seemingly vanishes into thin air. Spaulding's mentor, Ed Pace, is meanwhile murdered.\nUpon arrival in Buenos Aires, Spaulding meets and falls in love with Jean Cameron, a woman employed by the embassy. Attacks on him continue, and he suspects he is being trailed by the Gestapo. He meets with Rhinemann to acquire the gyroscopes, but tries to draw out his mysterious assailants \u2013 Rhinemann and the other Germans are adamant that the Gestapo is not active in Buenos Aires.\nTo his profound shock, Spaulding discovers that the people trying to stop him work for the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary organization set on stopping the exchange. When he captures Asher Feld, the Haganah leader, Feld informs him that he is a party to an exchange of diamonds for gyroscopes. From then on, Spaulding decides that the exchange must be stopped. He pretends to carry out his end, all the while facilitating a Haganah attack on Rhinemann's estate. Spaulding succeeds in killing Rhinemann (who had planned to kill him after the exchange) and Rhinemann's Nazi controller. Having acquired incriminating evidence about the exchange, Spaulding blackmails the Americans who had arranged it and arranges to retire with his beloved Jean.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was the first in a series of books that advanced a new \"revisionary\" or antithetical approach to literary criticism. Bloom's central thesis is that poets are hindered in their creative process by the ambiguous relationship they necessarily maintain with precursor poets. While admitting the influence of extraliterary experience on every poet, he argues that \"the poet in a poet\" is inspired to write by reading another poet's poetry and will tend to produce work that is in danger of being derivative of existing poetry, and, therefore, weak. Because poets historically emphasize an original poetic vision in order to guarantee their survival into posterity, the influence of precursor poets inspires a sense of anxiety in living poets. Thus Bloom attempts to work out the process by which the small minority of 'strong' poets manage to create original work in spite of the pressure of influence. Such an agon (a vain attempt by a writer to resolve the conflict between his ideas and those of a much more influential predecessor), Bloom argues, depends on six revisionary ratios, which reflect Freudian and quasi-Freudian defense mechanisms, as well as the tropes of classical rhetoric.\nBefore writing this book, Bloom spent a decade studying the Romantic poets of the early nineteenth century. This is reflected in the emphasis given to those poets and their struggle with the influence of John Milton, Robert Burns, and Edmund Spenser. Other poets analyzed range from Lucretius and Dante to Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and John Ashbery. In The Anxiety of Influence and other early books, Bloom claimed that influence was particularly important for post-enlightenment poets. Conversely, he suggested that influence might have been less of a problem for such poets as Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Bloom later changed his mind, and the most recent editions of The Anxiety of Influence include a preface claiming that Shakespeare was troubled early in his career by the influence of Christopher Marlowe. The book itself is divided into six major categories, called \"six revisionary ratios\" by Bloom.  They are clinamen, tessera, kenosis, daemonization, askesis, and apophrades.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Barrett says opinion is \"divided as to whether it is an ancient work with later interpolations or a forgery confected from ancient sources.\" On the one hand, the Liezi could contain a core of c. 400 BCE authentic writings of Lie Yukou; on the other hand, it could be a c. 400 CE compilation forged by Zhang Zhan.\nThe Liezi is most similar with the Zhuangzi. They share many characters and stories; Graham  lists sixteen complete episodes plus sections from others. The Zhuangzi also mentions Liezi in four chapters and Lie Yukou in three, for example, the famous passage about Liezi's ability to ride the wind and go flying around in chapter 1.The final two chapters have heterogeneous contents that differ from the Daoism elsewhere in the book. Chapter 7 records the Yangism philosophy of \"Yang Zhu\" (Yangzi), infamous for the criticism of Mencius that he, \"believed in 'every man for himself.' If he could have helped the whole world by plucking out a single hair, he would not have done it.\" Zhang Zhan speculates that this chapter, focusing on indulgence in physical and temporary pleasures, was from Lie Yukou's earlier years in Yangism, before he became a Daoist. The well-known scholar of Chinese philosophy, Wing-Tsit Chan calls the \"Yang Zhu\" chapter \"negative Daoism\" in contrast with the Daoism of Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Huainanzi that were \"all positive in that each represents something new.\" Chapter 8, \"Explaining Conjunctions,\" is primarily taken from other early sources, not only Daoist but Confucian and Mohist texts, two philosophies that opposed the philosophical Daoism this book expounds.\nA. C. Graham, Professor Emeritus of the School of Oriental and African Studies, illuminated the textual provenance. After his translation of Liezi in 1960, which Barrett calls undoubtedly \"the best translation into a Western language to date\", Graham linguistically analyzed internal evidence and textual parallels. He discovered many cases where the Liezi is clearly secondary to other texts, but none where it is the primary source for a passage. The Preface to the revised Liezi translation explains his significant change in attitude.\n\nAlthough in 1960 most scholars in China already recognized the late date of [Liezi], most Westerners were still disinclined to question its antiquity. My own textual studies, not yet completed when this translation first appeared, supported the Chinese dating, which by now prevails also in the West. \u2026 One result of the textual investigation came as a surprise to me. The present book describes the hedonist 'Yang [Zhu]' chapter as 'so unlike the rest of [Liezi] that it must be from another hand \u2026 The thought is certainly very different, and it does show the signs of editing and interpolation by the Taoist author \u2026 But although close scrutiny generally reveals marked differences in style between the body of the book and passages borrowed from earlier sources, I could find none to distinguish the hedonist chapter from the rest.\nOwing to occasional Liezi textual misunderstandings in Zhang Zhan's commentary, Graham concludes that the \"guiding hand\" probably belonged to Zhang's father or grandfather, which would mean c. 300 CE.\nSuggestions of Buddhist influences in Liezi chapters 3 and 6 are potentially corroborating evidence for a late date of composition; see Buddhism in China. \"King Mu of Zhou\" discusses sense perceptions as illusions; \"Endeavor and Destiny\" takes a fatalistic (if not karmic) view of destiny, which goes against the traditional Daoist concept of Wuwei.", "hasanswer": false}]}

What resulted was an effort produced by Mark Goodson Productions that combined the Hollywood Squares program, under license from Orion, with a revival of the Goodson-produced Match Game. The 60-minute program was dubbed The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour and debuted on October 31, 1983, at 3 p.m. Eastern, replacing the Peter Marshall-hosted series Fantasy. Jon Bauman (appearing as himself without his \"Bowzer\" persona from Sha Na Na) hosted the Hollywood Squares portion of the show. The only regular panelist on this version was Gene Rayburn, who reprised his role as host of Match Game; he always occupied the lower left square during Hollywood Squares, which Bauman also occupied during Match Game segments. Most of the semi-regulars were previously better known for Match Game (only on two weeks of episodes did a regular from the previous Hollywood Squares, George Gobel, appear on the panel). The announcer for this version was Gene Wood but was also sub-announced by either Rich Jefferies or Johnny Olson.\nHollywood Squares was always played as the second (middle) segment of the show, and featured the winner of the Match Game match played in the first half of the program playing O and the show's returning champion playing X, regardless of the player's genders (all other versions had women playing O and men playing X with exceptions, as noted above). This version of Hollywood Squares saw several different variations on the gameplay. First, the panelists were not given bluff answers or briefed. Second, the questions followed either a multiple-choice or true/false format. Third, for each square a contestant claimed $25 was added to his/her score with each game win starting at $100 for the first and increasing by that amount for subsequent games until time ran out and a winner was declared. In contrast to the original version of the show, players could win games by default if the opposing player incorrectly agreed/disagreed with a celebrity whose square gave the other player a completed row or five-square win. On all other versions of Squares, the player had to earn the winning celebrity's square on their own. The winner played the Super Match from Match Game for a cash prize.\nThe Match Game segment featured six panelists, as it had from 1973 to 1982; for the Hollywood Squares portion, a third tier was added to the panel seating area, with three more celebrities being introduced to the proceedings at the show's midpoint. All nine celebrities could play the Super Match.\nThe Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour was not a success and NBC announced its cancellation in the spring of 1984, with the final episode airing on July 27, 1984.

But Kakutani felt that the book's editing was uneven, resulting in too much detail in some sections, and \"jump cuts\" in other areas that \"chop the narrative into herky-jerky pieces and slow the book's momentum\". The A.V. Club said Townshend's accounts of the making of albums like Who's Next and Quadrophenia are \"breathtaking\", but complained that \"there are glaring gaps and dead ends in his story.

Nevertheless, much of the optimism of the first remained in its expressed hope that war and poverty would be eliminated.\nIn addition to its absolute rejection of theism, deism and belief in credible proof of any afterlife, various political stances were supported, such as opposition to racism and weapons of mass destruction; support of human rights; a proposition of an international court; and the rights to unrestricted contraception, abortion, divorce, and death with dignity (e.g., euthanasia and suicide).\nInitially published with a small number of signatures, the document was circulated and gained thousands more; the American Humanist Association's website encourages visitors to add their own name.  A provision at the end of the Manifesto\u2014stating that the signators do \"not necessarily endorse every detail\" of the document, but only its broad vision\u2014likely helped many overcome reservations about attaching their name.\nOne of the oft-quoted lines that comes from the Manifesto is, \"No deity will save us; we must save ourselves.\"\nThe Humanist Manifesto II first appeared in The Humanist's September/October 1973 edition, when Paul Kurtz and Edwin H.

At least one American play was also written before Barker's: Ponteach, published by Robert Rogers in 1766, though the piece was apparently never produced. However, more recently uncovered evidence shows a record of an anonymous melodrama entitled Captain Smith and the Princess Pocahontas produced at The Chestnut Street Theatre in 1806, calling into question whether Barker's play was really the first of its kind (though no further information is known about the earlier piece).

Xiao Tong sought out an appropriate place to bury Consort Ding, but while he was doing so, a landowner bribed the eunuch Yu Sanfu (\u4fde\u4e09\u526f) into convincing Emperor Wu that that piece of land would bring good fortune for the emperor, and so Emperor Wu bought the land and buried Consort Ding there.  However, once Consort Ding was buried, a Taoist monk informed Xiao Tong that he believed that the land would bring ill fortune for Consort Ding's oldest son\u2014Xiao Tong.  Xiao Tong therefore allowed the monk to bury a few items intended to dissolve the ill fortune, such as wax gooses, at the position reserved for the oldest son.  Later on, when one of Xiao Tong's attendants, Bao Miaozhi (\u9b91\u9088\u4e4b), was squeezed out of Xiao Tong's inner circles by another attendant, Wei Ya (\u9b4f\u96c5), he, in resentment, reported to Emperor Wu that Wei had carried out sorcery on Xiao Tong's behalf.  When Emperor Wu investigated, waxed gooses were found, and Emperor Wu became surprised and angry, and wanted to investigate further.  He only stopped the investigation when he was advised to do so by the prime minister Xu Mian, executing only the Taoist monk who had suggested the burial of wax gooses.  Xiao Tong became humiliated in the affair, and was never able to clear himself completely in his father's eyes.\nXiao Tong died in 531.  Even when he was very ill, because he was afraid to make Emperor Wu be concerned about him, he still personally wrote submissions to his father.  After his death, Emperor Wu personally attended his wake and buried him at a tomb appropriate for an emperor. He also summoned Xiao Tong's oldest son, Xiao Huan (\u856d\u6b61) the Duke of Huarong back to the capital Jiankang, preparing to create Xiao Huan crown prince to replace his father. However, still resentful over the wax goose affair, he hesitated for days without carrying out the creation, and finally did not do so.  Instead, against popular opinion, he created Xiao Tong's younger brother, also by Consort Ding, Xiao Gang crown prince.  In 551, when Xiao Gang, then emperor (as Emperor Jianwen) but under control and virtual house arrest by the general Hou Jing, Hou, to try to show off his power, deposed Emperor Jianwen and made Xiao Tong's grandson Xiao Dong the Prince of Yuzhang emperor.

This masque was designed by Inigo Jones and written for Queen Anne of Denmark. Gary Waller, in his book The Sidney Family Romance, explains that this masque was controversial because Wroth and the other female actors appeared in blackface as the twelve daughters of Niger.\nAnita Hagerman, in her article \"'But Worth pretends': Discovering Jonsonian Masque in Lady Mary Wroth's Pamphilia to Amphilanthus\", discusses Wroth's role in Jonson's The Masque of Blackness and the specific influence of the theme of darkness on Sonnet 22. She states that Wroth played a character named Baryte, an Ethiopian maiden. Hagerman suggests that Wroth created a courtly persona for herself in these masques and that the themes of this persona are themes in Pamphilia to Amphilanthus. One idea of Wroth's courtly persona was darkness, probably stemming from her reputation of seriousness. The theme of dark versus light is explored in Sonnet 22 and is representative of her uncertainty of whether she wants her desires for Amphilanthus to be fulfilled or not, because either way will prove \"torturous\".The idea of theatricality influences the way this poem is interpreted. Because it is understood that Wroth is talking about her experience in a theatrical performance, the theme of the artificial aspect of the masque performance needs to be taken into account. Hagerman says that in the way that Pamphilia is ambivalent about what to do with her love for Amphilanthus, Wroth herself is ambivalent about the life of courtly masques. The contradiction of allowing women to have \"feminine expressive display\" of feelings and then strictly \"enforced silence\" could have represented the good and the bad of courtly life for Wroth. In the masques, Wroth was given a voice, but after she was no longer affiliated with the court life, she recognized the artificiality of the voice she had because the courtly life and the masques require a level of falseness. Gary Waller states that Wroth's female characters describe the pressure they feel in terms of theater and display. For a female to take part in a masque, she is creating the illusion of power because she is entering the space of the court and commanding attention. However, it subjects her to the gaze of men and makes her feel powerless and victimized.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "50_510", "question": "Who is the author of The Hardy Boys?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27390", "text": "The Hardy Boys have been called \"a cultural touchstone all over the world.\" Their adventures have been continuously in print since 1927. The series was an instant success: by mid-1929 over 115,000 books had been sold. As of 2008, the series remained successful, with the first Hardy Boys book, The Tower Treasure, selling over 100,000 copies a year. Worldwide, over 70 million copies of Hardy Books have been sold. A number of critics have tried to explain the reasons for the characters' longevity.\nOne explanation for this continuing popularity is that the Hardy Boys are simple wish fulfillment. Their adventures allow readers to vicariously experience an escape from the mundane. At the same time, Frank and Joe live ordinary lives when not solving mysteries, allowing readers to identify with characters who seem realistic and whose parents and authority figures are unfailingly supportive and loving. The Hardy Boys also embody an ideal of masculinity: by their very name they \"set the stage for a gentrified version of hardiness and constructed hardiness as an ideal for modern American males\", part of the \"cultural production of self-control and mastery as the revered ideal for the American man.\" More controversially, to Meredith Wood, the characters embody not just an ideal of masculinity, but an ideal of white masculinity. She argues that \"racist stereotypes are ... fundamental to the success of the Hardy Boys series.\" In support of this claim, Wood cites what she says is the replacement of one stereotype (evil Chinese) with another (evil Latin Americans) in the original and revised versions of Footprints Under the Window. She further claims that this is the reason for the popularity of the Applewood Books reprints of the original, unrevised texts rather than the widely cited blandness of the rewrites.Critic Gary Westfahl considers the Hardy Boys to not display any sexuality. The Hardys' ignorance of sex and their increasing respect for the law have led to some negative perceptions and many parodies of the characters. They are \"well-scrubbed Boy Scout types\" who \"fetishized squareness.\" They have been parodied numerous times, in such works as The Hardy Boys and the Mystery of Where Babies Come From by Christopher Durang, The Secret of the Old Queen: A Hardy Boys Musical by Timothy Cope and Paul Boesing, and Mabel Maney's novel A Ghost in the Closet: A Hardly Boys Mystery. National Lampoon ran an article in 1985 entitled \"The Undiscovered Notebooks of Franklin W. Dixon\", in which the authors \"purport to have stumbled upon some unpublished Hardy Boys manuscripts\", including \"The Party Boys and the Case of the Missing Scotch\" and \"The Hardly Boys in the Dark Secret of the Spooky Closet.\"Others have pointed to the Hardy Boys' relationship with their father as a key to the success of the series. As Tim Morris notes, while Fenton Hardy is portrayed as a great detective, his sons are usually the ones that solve cases, making Fenton Hardy a paradoxical figure:\n\nHe is always there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is typically emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He can take on any shape but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except for the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course the only time we ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.\n\nAs a result, the Hardy Boys are able both to be superior to their father and to gain the satisfaction of \"fearlessly making their dad proud of them.\"In the end, many commentators find that the Hardy Boys are largely successful because their adventures represent \"a victory over anxiety.\" The Hardy Boys series teaches readers that \"although the world can be an out-of-control place, good can triumph over evil, that the worst problems can be solved if we each do our share and our best to help others.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Yves Lavandier examines works by major scriptwriters and playwrights (Samuel Beckett, Bertolt Brecht, Charles Chaplin, Herg\u00e9, Alfred Hitchcock, Henrik Ibsen, Ernst Lubitsch, Moli\u00e8re, Dino Risi, William Shakespeare, Sophocles, Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, etc.) in order to answer three questions:\n\nwhat do dramatic works consist of?\nwhy is this so?\nhow does one go about writing them?The author scans all the tools of dramatic narrative: conflict, protagonist, obstacles, suspense, characterisation, three-act structure, preparation, dramatic irony, comedy, activity, dialogue. A play written by Moli\u00e8re, The School for Wives, and a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, North by Northwest, are analysed in detail. Several appendices deal with writing for children, drama and literature, short films, documentaries, etc.\nIn the course of pages, Yves Lavandier develops several governing ideas. According to him:\n\nDrama preexists theater and film. Life being full of conflicts and ruled by causality, one can say that life is Aristotelian.\nThe art of narrative can be taught, like every other human activity.\nIt takes two to speak the language of drama: writer and receiver. This is why dramatic irony\u2014which consists in giving the audience an item of information that at least one of the characters is unaware of\u2014is a fundamental mechanism, omnipresent in all genres (tragedy, comedy, melodrama, suspense, thriller, etc.) and all types of narratives.\nAll the great storytellers know the rules of narration, at least unconsciously.\nOne can respect the rules and take the spectator into account while keeping one's liberty and authenticity.\nRules are called \u201crecipes\u201d by those who fear or despise them.\nDrama should not be placed in the same basket as literature, Moli\u00e8re and William Shakespeare beside Gustave Flaubert and Franz Kafka.\nDialogue, in theater or radio, is the visible part of the iceberg. Even in radio, structure and characterisation are paramount.\nTheater is, as well as film, an art of the image.\nTo write a good story, three things are needed: conflict, conflict and conflict.\nThe spectacular and the sensational are cheap ways to generate emotion and often mingle with voyeurism and omnipotence.\nWhen an actor is brilliant, he, of course, deserves all the plaudits he gets. But praise is also due to the director who directed him as well as to the writer who created his role in the first place.\nThe most powerful language of drama is structure, far before dialogue.\nNonetheless, the dialogue is inevitable when one tells a human story, even in silent movies where dialogues were numerous, either written on intertitles or guessed by the audience.\nThe three-act structure (dramatic acts, not logistical ones) relies simply on a universal triad: before-during-after. One can find the three-act structure in the vast majority of dramatic works, including in a narrative as deconstructed as 21 Grams.\nSuspense should not be mistaken with mystery, Alfred Hitchcock with Agatha Christie.\nComedy is a noble, useful and difficult treatment. Its lightness is only an appearance, politeness.\nAs the mockery of human limitations, comedy may be disparaging but also demanding or compassionate.\nThe basics of the narrative are the pattern of a fractal structure.\nTV series are highly respectable and can produce masterpieces of human art such as The Sopranos.\nChildren need good drama. To write for children is a wonderful school of narration.\nWriters of drama will always be indispensable and keep on responding to a triple human need of emotion, meaning and distraction.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Some of the 435 Jews in Hebron who survived were hidden by local Arab families, although the extent of this phenomenon is debated. Soon after, all Hebron's Jews were evacuated by the British authorities. Many returned in 1931, but almost all were evacuated at the outbreak of the 1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine.

The maiden Hwa-che seeks to solve the mystery, using the methods she has learned from the crime novels of the Western barbarians. In this she is aided by Chin-tung, the mandarin's male secretary. Initially disguised as a man, she and Chin-tung become increasingly attracted to each other as the story progresses.\nThe story humorously spoofs the conventions of the mystery novel, and contains allusions to well known fictional detectives.

The eponymous heroine of the poem was an impoverished Attic widow with whom Theseus stayed on his way to subdue the Marathonian Bull. On his return from accomplishing this feat, Theseus found that his hostess had died, and, in return for her humble hospitality, the hero founded a deme named for her and established there a sanctuary of Zeus Hecaleus in her honor. Although poorly preserved by papyrus fragments and quotations in ancient authors, the broad outline of the Hecale is relatively certain, and the text stands as an important witness to the poorly understood genre of the Hellenistic epyllion.

He is never referred to by name in the play itself but he is well named. Joe addresses to him \u2013 albeit somewhat obsequiously \u2013 as, \"My Lord,\" since, despite his apparent frailty, he has plainly been someone used to wielding authority. There are only three sound effects used in the entire play, the shuffle [Beckett's descriptive stage direction) of Croak's feet as he arrives and departs, the thud/dropping of his club (staff?) reminiscent of the rulers wielded by the Animator in Rough for Radio II and the music teacher in Embers and the rapping of Music's baton reminiscent of a once prevalent practice among conductors of the past which is now far less widespread. The club and baton function as objects of authority. They form an interesting dyad prominently employed throughout the play.\nFor entertainment, Croak, (a Beckettian \u2018old King Cole\u2019) has only two old stalwarts to call on, his minstrels, Joe (Words) and Bob (Music). Each is heard to be possibly an abstraction and/or a being of some sort manifested through their respective vocabularies (music/words). Do they have actual physical form? This remains an unanswerable question. With radio remaining a solely sonic medium, we can only conjecture (Beckett sets up similar uncertainty in much of his work). Words/Music function in a way resembling court artists/musicians of the past. Word's repeatedly addressing Croak as \"My Lord\" and the strange formality to the domination both Words/Joe and Music/Bob seem accustomed to enduring adds an ancient (medieval?) or primitively regal aspect to the proceedings.\nThe modern shortened names (Joe, Bob) add a humorous contemporary contrast to the generally ancient (or timeless) seeming circumstances. The source of Croak's power over them is never explained or questioned-adding to the mysterious atmosphere.\nAlfred Alvarez refers to Croak as \"a poet\" though there is no real evidence to suggest that he is. In fact his utterances throughout the play are terse: moans, groans and murmurings mainly along with a few short lines (commands, entreaties or outbursts). That said, he appears to appreciate poetry especially when set to music. The first theme Croak proclaims for the evening's diversion is \"Love.\" Beckett offers several clues to help imagine Croak as a specific character. His shuffling feet, choice of themes, self-torturing reminiscence and intense reactions to much of what Words and Music produce/perform all seem to indicate that he is a decrepit version of Orsino with his famous opening line from Twelfth Night: \"If music be the food of love, play on,\" a hopeless romantic, in love with love, and the melancholy brought on by the mere thought of it. Croak could almost be the selfsame man, had he never moved from that spot for the rest of his life and now finds himself perhaps approaching the brink of death. Or does this gathering occur again and again outside time? So many Beckett works present characters seemingly caught in endless cycles of repetition (those who wait in \"Waiting for Godot\"/the appearing-disappearing woman in \"Ill Seen Ill Said\"/The urn-dwelling trio in \"Play\" etc.) that this is always a possibility.\nAdditional related aspects of Love that Croak focuses on as sub-themes are \"Age,\" \"Face,\" (With two foreshadowing mentions earlier on in the play-once by Croak and then latter by Words) and the climactic naming of \"Lily\" which is discussed later regarding its various implications. After this iteration Croak is reduced to groans, an anguished \"No!\" and the eventual dropping of his \"club\" followed by shuffling away. His entrance/exit frames the main body of the play.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His father, Hideyuki, contracts a deadly disease known as Metastatic Human Cancer (MHC), a terminal cancer that affects all forms of organic life: humans, animals and plants. Events lead Hideyuki to tell Kaoru more about a research program he was involved in called the LOOP project: a virtual reality simulator which is meant to represent the emergence of life and how the world most likely evolved. It is known that almost everyone who was involved in the LOOP project has died of the same cancer.\nKaoru takes a part-time job tutoring a boy named Ryoji, who is an asymptomatic carrier of MHC along with his mother, Reiko. Despite her being fifteen years his senior, Kaoru falls in love with Reiko. Eventually, they begin an affair once Ryoji begins chemotherapy. When he finds out, Ryoji commits suicide by falling backwards out of a twelve-story building. About a month afterwards, Kaoru learns from Reiko that she may be pregnant with Kaoru's child. He also reads Ryoji's suicide note, in which he explains his motivation for taking his own life.\nAs Kaoru continues his investigation into the LOOP project, his father asks him to meet a microbiologist named Amano, was involved in the final stages of LOOP before it was scrapped. Amano reveals that LOOP utilized a hundred supercomputers strung together with the aim to recreate life, and tells Kaoru of a scientist in New Mexico who might still be alive. During this period he also finds out that the MHC cells all equal 2n X 3. Kaoru's mother, Machiko, convinces him to go to New Mexico after relating a tale of the \"Ancient One\" who has a thousand eyes watching.\nKaoru then ventures to New Mexico, only to find the scientist dead. However, inside the scientist's lab, the computer turns itself on and tells Kaoru to put on a pair of virtual reality goggles and gloves, which brings him into the LOOP simulation. Kaoru experiences a Native American's life who has a wife and two children and is brutally murdered by white colonisers. Coming out of the simulation, Kaoru calls Amano and asks for the coordinates of the events that are crucial to the LOOP evolution: the lives of Asakawa, Takayama and Yamamura. Amano pinpoints the exact coordinates of the events that take place. He also explains how Kaoru can either merge consciousness with people in LOOP or that he watch from afar like a ghost. He then finds out, in complete detail, events from the previous novels navigating from different angles. First he looks at things from Ryuji's eyes, then Asakawa, finally settling on a character named Ando who finds out the truth about Sadako.\nSoon after that, he has another discussion with Amano, who knows that the LOOP's creator had intentions to recreate Ryuji's death. By doing so, he could create a clone and insert him into a woman's womb. But what they forgot is that Ryuji's clone would carry the Ring Virus with his genes. Therefore, when Ryuji was reborn, the virus escaped and mutated into the MHC virus.\nDesperate to find the cure for the MHC virus, Kaoru ventures deeper west into the desert only to encounter a storm that leaves him on the verge of death. He is then saved by an old man named Eliot who has purposefully crafted all the events to bring Kaoru to him. After essentially resurrecting Kaoru, the man explains what has happened, and that, Kaoru is Ryuji's clone. As a result, Kaoru has an exceptional gift of immunity to the MHC virus. In order to stop the virus from destroying the real world, Kaoru is essentially sent back to the LOOP world as the one who solves (and eventually stops) the Ring virus. One of the main problems is that he cannot come back to the real world to see his father (still in the hospital) or Reiko ever again. In order to save them, he agrees.\nUpon accepting, the old man transfers Kaoru's analyzed molecules into the LOOP where he promises that Reiko can see him. In the LOOP, Kaoru solves the problem with the help of Ando. He watches Ando's resurrected son play in the water. Once Ando leaves, Kaoru looks up at the stars wondering about Reiko.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "50_606", "question": "Who is the author of Watchmen?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27707", "text": "A critical and commercial success, Watchmen is highly regarded in the comics industry and is frequently considered by several critics and reviewers as comics' greatest series and graphic novel. In addition to being one of the first major works to help popularize the graphic novel publishing format alongside The Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen has also become one of the best-selling graphic novels ever published. Watchmen was the only graphic novel to appear on Time's 2005 \"All-Time 100 Greatest Novels\" list, where Time critic Lev Grossman described the story as \"a heart-pounding, heartbreaking read and a watershed in the evolution of a young medium.\" It later appeared on Time's 2009 \"Top 10 Graphic Novels\" list, where Grossman further praised Watchmen, proclaiming \"It's way beyond clich\u00e9 at this point to call Watchmen the greatest superhero comic ever written-slash-drawn. But it's true.\" In 2008, Entertainment Weekly placed Watchmen at number 13 on its list of the best 50 novels printed in the last 25 years, describing it as \"The greatest superhero story ever told and proof that comics are capable of smart, emotionally resonant narratives worthy of the label 'literature'.\" The Comics Journal, however, ranked Watchmen at number 91 on its list of the Top 100 English-language comics of the 20th century.In Art of the Comic Book: An Aesthetic History, Robert Harvey wrote that, with Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons \"had demonstrated as never before the capacity of the [comic book] medium to tell a sophisticated story that could be engineered only in comics\". In his review of the Absolute Edition of the collection, Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times wrote that the dark legacy of Watchmen, \"one that Moore almost certainly never intended, whose DNA is encoded in the increasingly black inks and bleak storylines that have become the essential elements of the contemporary superhero comic book,\" is \"a domain he has largely ceded to writers and artists who share his fascination with brutality but not his interest in its consequences, his eagerness to tear down old boundaries but not his drive to find new ones.\" Alan Moore himself said his intentions with works like Marvelman and Watchmen were to liberate comics and open them up to new and fresh ideas, thus creating more diversity in the comics world by showing the industry what could be done with already existing concepts. Instead it had the opposite effect, causing the superhero comic to end up stuck in a \"depressive ghetto of grimness and psychosis\". In 2009, Lydia Millet of The Wall Street Journal contested that Watchmen was worthy of such acclaim, and wrote that while the series' \"vividly drawn panels, moody colors and lush imagery make its popularity well-deserved, if disproportionate\", that \"it's simply bizarre to assert that, as an illustrated literary narrative, it rivals in artistic merit, say, masterpieces like Chris Ware's 'Acme Novelty Library' or almost any part of the witty and brilliant work of Edward Gorey\".Watchmen was one of the two comic books, alongside Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, that inspired designer Vincent Connare when he created the Comic Sans font.In 2009, Brain Scan Studios released the parody Watchmensch, a comic in which writer Rich Johnston chronicled \"the debate surrounding Watchmen, the original contracts, the current legal suits over the Fox contract\".Also in 2009, to coincide with the release of the Watchmen movie, IDW Publishing produced a parody one-shot comic titled Whatmen?!Grant Morrison wrote a scene in Pax Americana (2014) where a child shoots his father in the head with his own gun, killing him. This was meant to symbolize Morrison's opinion about how the limited series had a negative impact on the superhero genre: \"it's Watchmen's shot to the head of the American superhero.\"In September 2016, Hasslein Books published Watching Time: The Unauthorized Watchmen Chronology, by author Rich Handley. The book provides a detailed history of the Watchmen franchise.In December 2017, DC Entertainment published Watchmen: Annotated, a fully annotated black-and-white edition of the graphic novel, edited, with an introduction and notes by Leslie S. Klinger (who previously annotated Neil Gaiman's The Sandman for DC). The edition contains extensive materials from Alan Moore's original scripts and was written with the full collaboration of Dave Gibbons.\nRorschach appears in Laura Beatty's 2019 novel, Lost Property.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "50_621", "question": "Who is the author of The Shock Doctrine?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27758", "text": "The book is divided into seven parts with a total of 21 chapters.\nPart 1 begins with a chapter on psychiatric shock therapy and the covert experiments conducted by the psychiatrist Ewen Cameron in collusion with the Central Intelligence Agency. The second chapter introduces Milton Friedman and his Chicago school of economics, whom Klein describes as leading a laissez-faire capitalist movement committed to creating free markets that are even less regulated than those that existed before the Great Depression.\nPart 2 discusses the use of \"shock doctrine\" to transform South American economies in the 1970s, focusing on the 1973 coup in Chile led by General Augusto Pinochet and influenced by a prominent group of Chilean economists, known as the Chicago Boys, who had been trained at the University of Chicago in the Economics department, funded by the CIA, and advised by Milton Friedman. Klein connects torture with economic shock therapy.\nPart 3 covers attempts to apply the shock doctrine without the need for extreme violence against sections of the population. Klein says that Margaret Thatcher applied mild shock \"therapy\" facilitated by the Falklands War, while free market reform in Bolivia was possible due to a combination of pre-existing economic crises and the charisma of Jeffrey Sachs.\nPart 4 reports on how Klein thinks the shock doctrine was applied in Poland, China, South Africa, Russia, and the Four Asian Tigers. In Poland she discusses how the left-leaning trade union Solidarity won the country's 1989 legislative elections, but subsequently employed the shock doctrine due to IMF pressure. The section on China discusses the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests, and the liberalization of China's economy. In South Africa she explains that the negotiations to end apartheid resulted in economic policy that went against the core of the Freedom Charter. In Russia she describes how Boris Yeltsin took power after the collapse of the Soviet Union and crafted an economic policy that turned Russia into an oligarchy. Finally, she says that during the 1997 Asian financial crisis the Tiger Nations were forced to sell off numerous state enterprises to private, foreign companies.Part 5 introduces the \"Disaster Capitalism Complex\", a complex series of networks and influence employed by private companies that allows them to profit from disasters. She mirrors this new Disaster Capitalism Complex with the Military Industrial Complex and explains that both employ the blurring of the line between private and public, through tactics like the revolving door.\nPart 6 discusses the use of \"shock and awe\" in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent occupation of Iraq, which Klein describes as the most comprehensive and full-scale implementation of the shock doctrine ever attempted, with mass privatization of Iraqi state-owned enterprises (including thousands of men being laid off) which is argued as contributing to the insurgency, since many of the unemployed became embittered toward the US as a result and joined insurgent groups afterward.\nPart 7 is about winners and losers of economic shock therapy \u2013 how small groups will often do very well by moving into luxurious gated communities while large sections of the population are left with decaying public infrastructure, declining incomes and increased unemployment. Klein describes economic policy after Hurricane Katrina, the 2004 Sri Lanka Tsunami, and the apartheid-style policy of the Israeli government toward Palestinians.\nThe Conclusion details the backlash against the \"shock doctrine\" and economic institutions which, in Klein's view, encourage it \u2013 like the World Bank and IMF. South America and Lebanon post-2006 are shown in a positive light, where politicians are already rolling back free-market policies, with some mention of the increased campaigning by community-minded activists in South Africa and China.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It also furnished him with abundant subject-matter, and indeed Lockhart claimed that \"In the text and notes of this early publication, we can now trace the primary incident, or broad outline of almost every romance, whether in verse or in prose\" of his career as a creative writer.  It has been shown that his novel Old Mortality, for example, derives its setting and much of its action, personnel and motivation from two Minstrelsy ballads, The Battle of Loudon Hill and The Battle of Bothwell Bridge.  As the scholar H. J. C. Grierson wrote, the Minstrelsy was \"the tap-root of Scott's later work as a poet and novelist\".With the publication of the Minstrelsy, the ballad finally became a fashionable and respectable form, increasingly displacing the Burnsian type of lyric poem in literary favour.  James Hogg was one of those who responded to this shifting of the market by trying to surpass the imitations of ancient ballads in its third volume.  One of the consequences of Scott's use of the phrase Scottish Border in his title, in spite of the fact that many of his ballads came from north-east Scotland, was to popularize the still current fallacy that the Borders rather than the north-east were the richest source of Scottish ballads.  Most ballad editors of the 19th century and later, such as William Motherwell and Francis James Child, practised strict fidelity to one source, but Scott's example of preferring collation was followed by some of his successors, and can be seen in William Allingham's Ballad Book, Arthur Quiller-Couch's Oxford Book of Ballads, and Robert Graves's The English Ballad and English and Scottish Ballads.Across Europe the publication of the Minstrelsy was an inspiration to literary nationalists.  It was translated into French, Danish and Swedish, and individual ballads from it into Czech and Hungarian.  There were two German translations of the Minstrelsy: one by Henriette Schubart, and another by Elise von Hohenhausen, Willibald Alexis and Wilhelm von L\u00fcdemann. Wilhelm Grimm rendered two of its ballads into German, Theodor Fontane another, and the Minstrelsy profoundly influenced Fontane's own ballads.  Most importantly, perhaps, the publication of the Minstrelsy was the main impulse that led Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim to produce their famous collection of German folk-poems and legends, Des Knaben Wunderhorn, itself the inspiration for the collections of other folklorists and the source of musical settings by some of the greatest composers of the 19th century.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "50_657", "question": "Who is the author of Dead Man Walking?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27868", "text": "The title of the book comes from a once-traditional phrase in American prisons to designate men who had been sentenced to death. They were held on what was known as death row and were deprived of most social contact and barred from work or participation in prison programs. Prior to the 1960s, when guards would lead a condemned man down the prison hallway, they would call out, \"Dead man walking! Dead man walking here!\" The origin of the phrase is unknown. It may have been to warn other staff or prisoners to let them know that they should be on their guard since a death row prisoner has nothing to lose and could be violent. It may also have been a kind of honorific declamation, to let other prisoners know that they should move out of the way, death row prisoners being seen as an elite within the prison system. Alternatively, the call may have been a stigma attached to the condemned man, to remind others within earshot not to touch him to avoid catching his bad luck. In any case, its symbolism is clear: the condemned prisoner, in the eyes of the law, was dead already.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "50_672", "question": "Who is the author of Gojiro?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27921", "text": "The earliest event is the striking of a comet into the earth 65 million years ago, at the Encrucijada Valley site as the first nuclear test later occurs. A small lizard witnesses and survives this event, and carries on his line. This lizard is revered as the heroic Varanidid by Gojiro's lizard homeland, though they forget what exactly he did. He is also the precursor of the reptilian creator-beast revered by the dying Monongae clan that lived in the same location before the nuclear tests occurred. The remains of the dead dinosaurs form fossil fuels which pool under the valley.\nMuch later, in the 19th century, Joseph Prometheus Brooks is born to a large middle American family, his father a severe and religious man. Joseph's mother recognizes his genius and manages to have him sent away at a very young age to the university of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, where he meets his future collaborator in nuclear physics, Victor Stiller. When he returns home on holiday, he finds that his father has burned the entire rest of the family to death, along with their home, believing that existence is an affront to God. Some time later, the last few members of the Monongae clan send supplications of help to the beast who lives inside the Earth to help them, and charge the youngest member, Nelson Monongae with reawakening him. That same night, he encounters Joseph Brooks' future wife Leona, who soon has visions of past and future events, including the striking of the comet, and an incomplete vision of an adult Joseph Brooks holding an object and looking at something. She travels to Germany, where she finds Joseph playing clarinet in and underground jazz club, having become disaffected by the university. They marry and travel to the United States, along with Victor Stiller, when WWII breaks out, Joseph and Victor becoming the premier nuclear scientists of the American war effort. Leona becomes pregnant nine months before the first nuclear test, a couple of years before 1945. Joseph intends the nuclear test to cause such vast destruction that it calls the attention of the creator of the world to Earth. Leona and Joseph's daughter, Sheila Brooks, is born on the day of the test, and Leona dies, having come too close to the blastwave in an attempt to witness God's manifestation.\nA couple years later, another site for a second test is chosen, the homeland of the lizard Gojiro. He is a young lizard uninitiated into adulthood and the mysteries of lizard philosophy, which involves bodily immersion in a pool of oil (the Black Spot) that bubbles to the surface. Immediately before he feels the compulsion to go to the black spot, he witnesses Victor, Joseph and a general surveying the spot and arguing, as well as the young Sheila in the window of the plane they arrived on. Gojiro is held captive by Joseph's baleful gaze at the same moment he feels the compulsion to go the Black Spot, and goes to it when Joseph breaks the staredown. Gojiro dawdles before the Spot, and just as he makes the resolution to jump, he is hit by the full force of the nuclear explosion test, preventing his immersion into full lizard-hood, and leading into his mutation into a 500 foot tall intelligent lizard, with the ability to breathe radioactive energy beams, incredible regenerative ability, and to involuntarily receive psychic messages and transport his consciousness into other bodies, due to his super-advanced \"Quadcameral\" brain, an advancement on the human three layer brain. He somehow floats to Radioactive Island, an unmapped island covered by a permanent dome of thick cloud, to which other lost souls affected by nuclear radiation will eventually float as well, along with entire pieces of land and the cultural/technological \"flotjet\" of the modern era.\nAround the same time as the nuclear tests were occurring, a Japanese scientist in Hiroshima was attempting to invent a radio with which the thoughts of animals could be heard. One year exactly before the nuclear bombing, his son, Yukio Komodo, is born. On Komodo's first birthday, the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima occurs. Two versions of this event are related. In the first version told at the opening of the novel, Komodo has a premonition of the incoming attack, and his parents die in the blast. Wandering through the blasted cityscape, he sends a supplication to Gojiro, who appears before him. In the other, his father has the premonition, and forces Komodo and the radio deep into a hole. The heat of the blast causes the radio to burn three concentric rings into his chest above his heart, which Komodo later takes to be the emblem of his bond with Gojiro. Mostly unharmed by the blast, he is nonetheless stunned into a catatonic state in which he is aware of the outside world but does not move. He becomes a celebrity after the war, meeting many famous people, including Victor Stiller. He is diligently nursed by a black soldier, Walter Crenshaw, who also keeps safe the radio he was found with. When Komodo is 10 years old, he receives a psychic supplication from Gojiro on Radioactive Island, and offers to be his friend. This awakens him from his coma, and Walter helps Komodo to escape on a fishing boat. Walter tries and fails to give the radio to Komodo as he escapes, but he keeps it safe from American authorities, entrusting it to his wife, never revealing it or Komodo's location. Komodo's death is then faked. At around the same time, Joseph Brooks drives around America with his daughter Sheila on the lam, eventually being captured, his death also being faked, and he is taken back to the Encrucijada, where he lives unknown to Sheila, and daily assumes the pose his wife had painted of him.\nKomodo arrives on Radioactive island, where he quickly becomes friends with Gojiro. Gojiro remembers this time as the highlight of his life, and they pledge to be together forever. Gojiro begins to expound philosophic dialogues, inspired by a muse he names \"Budd Hazard\", which act as an extension and elaboration of the philosophy of the lizards, centred around the processes of change, identity and evolution. Gojiro's obsessive interest in this philosophy leads him to force Komodo to alter their promise, to re-centre it around the creation of a new \"Beam and Bunch\", Hazard's conceptual analogue of a species/nation. The failure of this new promise is one of the contributing factors to Gojiro's later regret and depression. After this new promise is made, two new people arrive on the island, the child Shig and the teenage Kishi, both Japanese, the first of the \"atoms\", people affected by nuclear radiation, to arrive on the island. Komodo falls in love with Kishi, impregnating her and driving a wedge between him and Gojiro. When Komodo and Kishi attempt to leave the island, Gojiro enters a hallucinatory state of mad rage, and inadvertently kills Kishi when his thrashing causes her to fall from the boat and drown, her daughter Ebi being born at that exact instant. This event leads Shig to hate Gojiro, and causes Gojiro to become suicidally hateful of himself, but Komodo forgives his Gojiro.\nOther atoms begin arriving, and Komodo assumes a fatherly role toward them. Unlike Gojiro and Komodo's hopes of forming a new Beam with the atoms, the atoms are stupid, unruly and destructive, with the except of Shig and Ebi. Various attempts to form a bond between them and Gojiro end in failure, including a series of monster movies starring Gojiro in which the atoms appear as extras. Shig steals these recordings and releases them as feature films, to Gojiro's dismay when he finds them playing on TV. Gojiro's extreme popularity causes his fans to form a cult-like attachment to him, further fed by Shig feeding the outside world a bastardized version of Budd's philosophy. This culminates when Shig steals the design of a crystal radio Komodo has made in his lab (having become a mad scientist in the meantime), and sells them to Gojiro's fans, imploring them to use them to send constant supplications to Gojiro, begging for \"the 90 series (the capstone of Hazard's philosophy) and the PA (Gojiro's personal appearance before his fans). Through the crystal radios, Gojiro psychically receives every one of these supplications from across the world, and his mind is transported into their bodies, often experiencing great physical and psychic pain, as many of his fans are destitute and desperate. Komodo builds a radio tower to receive the supplications instead of Gojiro, the supplications killing the ground around the tower. Gojiro wanders near the tower and accidentally touches it, receiving the supplication of Billy Snickman, a feral American child who ardently watches Gojiro's movies from outside drive-in theatres. Billy merely asks Gojiro who he is, to which he inexplicably responds \"Bridger of Gaps, Linker of Lines, Nexus of Beam and Bunch, Defender of the Evoloo\". After this, Gojiro begs Komodo to sever whatever neural link in his brain allows the supplications to enter, which Komodo reluctantly does. They discover the Quadcameral brain does not possess Gojiro's regenerative powers, and the removal of the link is permanent. The vulnerability of his brain forms the basis of Gojiro's future suicide attempts. His final attempt, which he nearly succeeds at, causes Komodo to threaten double suicide if Gojiro succeeds, stopping Gojiro. He and Komodo agree to a final amendment to the Triple Ring Promise: if they fail to fulfill the promise in one year, Gojiro must be allowed to kill himself and Komodo to respect that and continue living.\nAround the same timespan, Sheila is tormented by visions centring around her father on the Encrucijada. Due to her extreme psychotherapy, she is not directly aware of this, and instead her visions are transmuted into apocalyptic nightmares that her husband Billy Zeber has turned into award-winning movies, making Sheila rich and famous. He is unable to alleviate her psychic pain however, and at a crisis point sends a letter of supplication to Radioactive Island, begging Gojiro to come to America and make a movie, Gojira and Joseph Brooks in the Valley of Decision, addressing Gojiro by the titles he responded to Billy's question. Gojiro and Komodo secretly make their way to America, Komodo shrinking Gojiro to the size of a normal lizard using a technology variously described as a shrinking pill, ray, injection or potion. Komodo meets Sheila and immediately feels a deep connection to her, but she refuses to acknowledge the plea she sent. Komodo finds that Shig got wind of their departure and managed to transport the atoms and the hyper-fertile biome of Radioactive Island to a peculiar mansion in California. Shig acts as Komodo and Gojiro's combined chauffeur, bodyguard, lawyer and spokesman, directing their activities from behind the scenes. Komodo meets figures in Hollywood, including the aged Victor Stiller. He also tries to meet Walter Crenshaw, but finds that he is dead, and his family suspect him of being an agent of the American government. Komodo convinces Gojiro to travel to the Encrucijada valley, hoping to find the source of Sheila's visions. Along the way, Gojiro encounters Billy and shies away from him, consumed by self-loathing. Komodo and Gojiro make it to the Valley, where Shig houses them in a vast underground chamber bored out by nuclear test explosions. On TV screens they see the image of Joseph Brooks that his wife had painted, but on live-feed TV screens. Komodo attempts to communicate with him but fails, and returns to Sheila to tell her her father is still alive. Gojiro remains behind, where he inexplicably begins to have a series of visions reminiscent of the 90 series supplications, where he experiences past events from the perspective of the Varanidid, and his own birth. He investigates the shack Joseph lives in, and finds a stack of paintings depicting the visions he just received, as well as the blackboard containing the equation Joseph solved to create the atomic bomb, and receives a vision of Nelson and Leona's meeting. During his spying, Victor and the general visit Joseph, attempting to communicate him, and both are briefly subject to the vision that keeps Joseph glued to the Encrucijada. Joseph says that the nuclear bomb was a failure, as it was unable to call God's attention.\nAt the same time, Komodo experiences a whirlwind of events as he attempts to take Sheila to the Encrucijada, but is waylaid by Victors government goons. Shig saves Komodo and Sheila by luring the paparazzi to them, then Komodo returns to the mansion to bury Ebi, who died soon after telling Sheila she wished that Sheila were her mother. Komodo then has a clandestine meeting with Billy Zeber, Sheila's husband, who charges Komodo with protecting her, disappearing into the night. Komodo is again captured by Victor, but is saved again by Shig and the atoms, as well as Walter Crenshaw's son.\nGojiro, still spying on Victor, has a vision of Victor's childhood, and witnesses Victor pick up the small comic book explaining Gojiro's true origin that Komodo had attempted to give to Victor, which inspires him to make a new equation on the blackboard. Gojiro returns to the cave and scrawls it on the wall, then sees on TV that the mansion has been ransacked. Komodo arrives and attempts to complete Joseph's work, arriving at a method to compress and disperse into nothingness anything at all, which Joseph hopes will be enough to draw God' attention, and Komodo and Gojiro fear will cause an \"All-Inclusive Crisis of the Evoloo\", a moment of such great chaos and change that the universe will be unable to surmount it and continue. Shig delivers the box Walter had been keeping secret, containing the Komodo's father's radio. Komodo and Gojiro simultaneously experience Komodo's lost childhood memories, as well as his and Gojiro's moments of birth. Komodo completes Victor's work, demonstrating it by annihilating some of his beloved pet birds. Gojiro is enraged at Komodo, and cannot understand Komodo's optimism at the situation. Sheila arrives and Komodo goes out to her. Gojiro takes a golden arsenic pill, but is sucked inside of it in accordance with Komodo's completed equation, where his consciousness disperses.\nKomodo and Leona meet the now centenarian Nelson Monongae, dressed as the Varanidid, who gives them a small capsule of oil. Komodo and Sheila return to the cave, where Komodo realises Gojiro has been sucked into the pill, and using devices capable of reading Gojiro's Quadcameral brainwaves, determines that whatever Beamic force had sent Gojiro's consciousness into the past was now sustaining only the single neural connection that once received the 90 series supplications, barely keeping him alive. They see Victor Stiller on TV tapping the oil under the Encrucijada, which they discern is the lifeblood of the Beam keeping Gojiro alive. The atoms blow up the derrick, and Sheila and Komodo immerse the pill in the capsule of oil, completing Gojiro's thwarted initiation into full lizardhood. Komodo links Sheila, himself (realising he is also Quadcameral) and the pill, so that Sheila's supplication can recall him from nothingness. Gojiro's dispersed consciousness experiences Sheila's birth (and witnesses Leona's death), and Sheila and Komodo's psychic union, then hears her supplication. He finds the will to live and reassembles his body, reappearing before Victor, who has an orb which is the completion of his plan to destroy all of creation. Victor tosses the orb, which Gojiro catches in his third eye, the window to the Quadcameral. The entire earth is sucked inside of Gojiro's brain, leaving him alone in space. He exhorts the world to reform itself, which it does, nobody on earth being aware of what has happened. Gojiro, Sheila and Komodo return to Radioactive Island, where Gojiro asks Komodo permission to die despite the fulfilment of the Triple Ring Promise, thinking that he is dying as he loses his regenerative powers. As they prepare Gojiro's funeral raft, they see Gojiro's long-lost homeland arrive on Radioactive Island, and rather than dying, he instead becomes the fully initiated adult lizard he failed to become as a child. Fourteen years later, Komodo leave a letter at Gojiro's homeland, telling him of his and Sheila's happy life together, and reminiscing about the time he and Gojiro spent together.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was funded by Eugenia \"Genya\" Doll, the wife of Henri George Doll and former wife of choreographer L\u00e9onide Massine, as a wedding gift to dancer Natalia Makarova, with her partner in the ballet being Mikhail Baryshnikov. Both of them are Russians who had defected to the U.S. and are members of the American Ballet Theatre (ABT). Robbins had seen the two dancing with ABT and admired both of them. Doll had danced with Robbins many years earlier. It is set to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's music, including four mazurkas and one waltz, the latter previously used in Fokine's Les Sylphides. Robbins had previously used Chopin's works in The Concert, Dances at a Gathering, and its follow-up, In the Night.Rehearsals for Other Dances began in spring 1976. At first, Robbins was concerned whether Baryshnikov, who was careful on the details, was \"grasp[ing] the nuances\". However, by the time the ballet was completed, he felt that \"one doesn't begin to say what he can do\". He was also impressed with Makarova's \"ability to do the most difficult adagio dancing with exquisite control and musicality\". Santo Loquasto, the costume designer, found that Robbins \"was on his best behavior\" due to his admiration for Baryshnikov. However, to ease the burden on the dancers and to avoid conflicts, Robbins also created some of the steps for other dancers beforehand.Baryshnikov thought \"the most difficult thing for [Robbins] was to find the form \u2013 the structure \u2013 of the ballet. He approached each section as a musical whole, and then had to work out the sequence in a way that was theatrically sound.\" Robbins would ask Baryshnikov to \"listen to the music\" and explain how he interpreted the music. He also did not use any \"verbal or psychological descriptions\", and used some very brief instructions. In some rehearsals, Robbins would dance Baryshnikov's part and the latter would not dance at all. However, Baryshnikov noted by seeing him dance, he understood what Robbins wanted, and brought him \"closest to dancing it the way he wanted\". It also helped Baryshnikov learn the ballet quicker than he expected. He called Robbins \"stupendous\", and the experience of working with him \"was a complete revelation\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The  Mishnah Berurah is accompanied by additional in-depth glosses called Be'ur Halakha, a reference section called Sha'ar Hatziyun (these two were also written by the Chofetz Chaim), and additional commentaries called Be'er Hagolah, Be'er Heitev, and Sha'arei Teshuvah.\nThe Mishnah Berurah's \"literary style can be described as follows: In relation to a given law of the Shulhan Aruch, he raises a particular case with certain peculiarities that may change the law; then, he enumerates the opinions of the Ahronim (the later authorities, of the 16th century  and on) on that case,  from the most lenient to the most stringent ; and finally, he decides between them....  Having displayed what we may call the \"leniency-stringency spectrum\", [he] actually offers the reader an array of conduct options from which he may pick the one that seems right for him. This choice is not altogether free, since [he] shows a clear inclination to one side of the spectrum - the stringent - and encourages the reader  to follow it, but still, the soft language of the ruling suggests that if one follows the other side of the spectrum, the lenient, he will not sin, since there are trustworthy authorities that may back his choice.\"Not all of the Mishnah Brurah was written by Kagan: some parts were instead written by his son or various students, which accounts for the existence of several contradictions between different rulings in the text.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Bush and other conservative candidates, as well as other conservative causes, from the pulpit. During the 2004 United States Presidential Election year, many Christian evangelicals publicly supported the reelection of George W. Bush, and ended up playing a major role in his re-election.As early as the 1990s, Boyd had become seriously concerned about the politicization of Christianity in North America. Boyd was especially disturbed by the way in which Evangelical Christians had come to align themselves with right-wing politics and the Republican Party. Instead of endorsing Bush for president, he delivered a sermon series entitled \"The Cross and the Sword\" calling on Christians to take a more humble approach toward politics, arguing instead that Christians should be careful not to align themselves with any particular political ideology, party, or candidate and should instead focus on following Jesus and embodying the values he taught. Boyd then authored Myth of a Christian Nation to further explicate his views on the subject.Boyd's book challenges the theology of the Christian right and the theory of American exceptionalism, as well the claim that America is a \"Christian Nation\". He instead argues that America is flawed and imperfect just like any other nation, and that the United States mirrors all other nations, or \"kingdoms of the world\" as the book calls them. He then contrasts the ethics and foundations of the \"kingdoms of the world\" with Jesus' teaching of the kingdom of God. Boyd argues that Christians owe their full allegiance to the Kingdom of God and must reject the coercive, violent, and unjust methods and means used by the kingdoms of the world. Christians, he believes, have no duty to \"Take America Back for God\" or to even be involved in the political sphere, and should not use politics as a means of transforming society. Boyd's next book, The Myth of the Christian Religion: Losing Your Life for the Beauty of a Revolution, expands on many of the themes and topics discussed in The Myth of a Christian Nation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It tells how a group of leading French citizens, men and women included, joined together to form an unusual group, The Society of Mutual Autopsy, with the aim of proving that souls do not exist. The idea was that, after death, they would dissect each other and (hopefully) show a direct relationship between brain shapes and sizes and the character, abilities and intelligence of individuals. The book argues that this strange scientific pact, and anthropology itself, which the group's members helped to develop, had its genesis in aggressive, evangelical atheism.Essentially, The End of the Soul is a study of science and atheism in France in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. It illustrates how anthropology grew in the context of an impassioned struggle between the forces of tradition, especially the Catholic faith, and those of a more freethinking modernism, and posits that it became for many a secular religion. Among the figures discussed are novelist \u00c9mile Zola, statesman Leon Gambetta, American birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, and Arthur Conan Doyle.The End of the Soul received the Ralph Waldo Emerson Award for 2004 from the Phi Beta Kappa Society as a book that \"is an important contribution to knowledge, serious scholarship with a broad pertinence to the human condition.\"\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

The former is the creator of the spiritual, the latter of the material world.\"Leo also claimed that the praying of the Rosary had resulted in Catholic victories over enemies in battles:\n\"[I]n the sixteenth century, when the vast forces of the Turks threatened to impose on nearly the whole of Europe the yoke of superstition and barbarism [...] the Christian fleet gained a magnificent victory, with no great loss to itself, in which the enemy were routed with great slaughter.\n[...] Similarly, important successes were in the last century gained over the Turks at Temeswar, in Pannonia, and at Corfu; and in both cases these engagements coincided with feasts of the Blessed Virgin and with the conclusion of public devotions of the Rosary. And this led our predecessor, Clement XI, in his gratitude, to decree that the Blessed Mother of God should every year be especially honoured in her Rosary by the whole Church.\"Leo saw the Rosary as \"an effective spiritual weapon against the evils afflicting society\". \"Not only do We earnestly exhort all Christians to give themselves to the recital of the pious devotion of the Rosary publicly, or privately in their own house and family, and that unceasingly, but we also desire that the whole of the month of October in this year should be consecrated to the Holy Queen of the Rosary.\"In furtherance of this, he recommended that from October 1 to November 2, in every parish, and where practicable in every chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin: \"let five decades of the Rosary be recited with the addition of the Litany of Loreto. We desire that the people should frequent these pious exercises; and We will that either Mass shall be said at the altar, or that the Blessed Sacrament shall be exposed to the adoration of the faithful, Benediction being afterwards given.\"", "hasanswer": true}]}

The Dark Is Rising Sequence is used as an over-arching title in several omnibus, boxed-set, and coordinated editions; but the title of The Dark is Rising is also used for the whole series.\nThe books depict a struggle between forces of good and evil called \"The Light\" and \"The Dark\", and draw upon Arthurian legends, Celtic mythology, Norse mythology and English folklore. Both magical and ordinary children are prominent throughout the series. It was inaugurated in 1965 with the U.K. publication by Jonathan Cape of Over Sea, Under Stone. The sequels were published 1973 to 1977, almost simultaneously in the U.K. and the U.S. Volume four, The Grey King (1975), won both the Newbery Medal, recognizing the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\", and the inaugural Tir na n-Og Award for English-language books with Welsh background. The concluding Silver on the Tree (1977) also won the annual Tir na n-Og Award.The novel The Dark Is Rising features Will Stanton, age 11, who learns on that birthday that he is one of an ancient magical people called \"Old Ones\", and is destined to wield the powers of The Light in the ancient struggle with The Dark.

[...] It's hard to take a body count of all those ideas which freefall off every page but then 'the thing to do is to walk in circles.' And occasionally pause. . . .\" In The New York Times Book Review, Thomas R. Edwards deemed End Zone an improvement over Americana and said that the writing \"is continuously energetic, shifty, fun to watch for its own sake.\u201d Edwards also argued that \"[Gary's] fever, casually introduced in the final paragraph, hints at the uncertain but possible value of vulnerability, persisting without certitude in a world where others accept defensive systems \u2014technologies, religion, games, the large or small cultisms that flourish where fear is.\u201dAnya Taylor at The City University of New York argued the book would endure, especially praising Gary's desert meditation on the end zone. Taylor discussed how the novel dramatizes certain limitations of language and negative social phenomena involving language (such as the covering of unpleasant truths through euphemisms, or the prevention of meaningful interaction through over-reliance on simplistic maxims), and interpreted the novel as \"a book about the decline of language under the bombardment of terms from thermonuclear warfare, and an attempt to revive language through an ascetic disciplined ritual of silence and self-loss\". Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of The New York Times stated that End Zone confirmed DeLillo as one of the best young writers of his time, writing that the author was skilled at building scenes for comedic effect and praising the football game that is considered the novel's centerpiece as well as the pick-up game in the snow.Bill Beckett of The Harvard Crimson was less positive. While writing that End Zone has perhaps the best extended account of a football game ever written, and that the novel shows the author's \"golden ear for the tin and tinsel of Americanese\", Beckett also argued that \"even isolated good satire can't hold together a disappointingly anticlimactic novel. DeLillo's buildup of suspense finally dissipates totally; many ominous hints are lost or forgotten by the end. [...] A season in the chaotic life of Gary Harkness, interesting as he is, does not suffice to make a satisfying whole.\"Chad Harbach lauded End Zone in 2004 as \"a wonderful and underrated novel\". Daniel Roberts highly praised the novel in a 2018 retrospective for The Paris Review, where he wrote, \"No novel nails the omnipresent violence of football better than End Zone\". In 2007, however, the novel was listed by New York as one of the DeLillo's works that is \"for fans only\": \"There\u2019s little plot to speak of in this second novel, just a series of hilarious riffs on the parallels between football and nuclear war. That\u2019s not the most original comparison to draw, and the ending\u2014or rather, the lack of one\u2014makes it an ultimately unsatisfying read.\"  In 2011, Martin Amis listed End Zone among his favorite novels in DeLillo\u2019s output. Jeff Somers conversely ranked it 10th out of 17 of the author\u2019s books, arguing that it was extremely funny but also that \"there\u2019s not much of a story here, and after meandering about for a while, it sort of just stops dead in its tracks.\"\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

The most famous Hellenistic allusion to the Catalogue is found in Hermesianax's Leontion, which included a catalogue of great literary figures and their loves, beginning with Orpheus and Agriope (more commonly known as Eurydice) and proceeding down to the poet's contemporaries, including his teacher Philitas of Cos. Many of the entries engage playfully with their subjects' work: Homer, for example, is portrayed as pining for Penelope. Directly preceding that lovestruck bard comes Hesiod's blurb:\n\nHere the \u0113' hoi\u0113-formula is styled as the name of a woman, cleverly rendered \"Anne Other\" by Helen Asquith, and the grumpy Hesiod who reviled his home in Ascra at Works and Days 639\u201340 becomes a discomfited lover-boy in the village. Phanocles, a near contemporary of Hermesianax, composed an elegiac catalogue of mythological pederastic relationships entitled the Loves or Beautiful Boys in which each story was introduced by the formula \u0113' h\u014ds (\u1f20' \u1f61\u03c2), \"or like\". Nicaenetus of Samos, a later Hellenistic poet, wrote his own Catalogue of Women and the otherwise unknown Sosicrates (or Sostratus) of Phanagoria was said to have written an Ehoioi (\u1f28\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9), the masculine equivalent of \"Ehoiai\". While allusions to the ehoie-formula and catalogue structure of the poem are most easily recognized, interaction with the Catalogue in Hellenistic poetry was not limited to plays upon these aspects: direct engagement with the myths found in the Catalogue were a popular way for the Alexandrians to show their Hesiodic affiliations.At Rome the poets of the Late Republic and Augustan age continued the Hellenistic period's allusive engagement with the Catalogue. Catullus, a poet who made plain his Callimachean affiliations, is the earliest Roman author who can be seen to engage with the Catalogue. In his epyllion on the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, Catullus alludes to the theoxeny that the proem to the Catalogue presented as a defining characteristic of the heroic age and to the epithalamium of the couple that was sung in a later book. In the Aeneid Vergil closes his catalogue of combatants with the swift female warrior Camilla, alluding to the Hesiodic account of Iphiclus' speed in \"a remarkably subtle nod to tradition in the best Alexandrian style.\" Ovid picked up on Vergil's allusion in the Metamorphoses with his treatment of Atalanta, which recast's his Roman forebear's allusion to Iphiclus in such a way that it highlights the Hesiodic character of his own poem in contrast with the Homeric character of the Aeneid.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, when Notta Bit More, a clown from the circus in Stumptown (somewhere in the humdrum backblocks of the United States of America), and a serious-minded orphan boy called Bobbie Downs (but renamed as Bob Up, by the cheerful Notta) drop into Mudge together, this seems to Mustafa to be his chance to send a non-Mudge person out to bring the famous Cowardly Lion to be the ten thousandth lion in Mudge.  Using a magic ring, he enchants Notta and Bob and compels them to set out on a quest to capture the Cowardly Lion.\nMeanwhile, in the Emerald City, the Cowardly Lion believes that he has depleted the reserve of courage imbued in him by the Wizard (as told in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). The mischievous Patchwork Girl, Scraps (who was first introduced in an earlier Baum-written title), misdirects the Lion into thinking that he can replenish his courage by eating a courageous man. Since the Lion dislikes the notion of harming anyone, he resolves to do the deed as quickly as possible, and so embarks on his quest to find, and eat, the bravest man in Oz.\nUnbeknownst to the Cowardly Lion, he is being hunted by Notta Bit More and Bob Up.

Among these epistles are some of the earliest extant Christian documents. They provide an insight into the beliefs and controversies of early Christianity. As part of the canon of the New Testament, they are foundational texts for both Christian theology and ethics.\nMost scholars believe that Paul actually wrote seven of the thirteen Pauline epistles (Galatians, Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Philemon, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians), while three of the epistles in Paul's name are widely seen as pseudepigraphic (First Timothy, Second Timothy, and Titus). Whether Paul wrote the three other epistles in his name (2 Thessalonians, Ephesians and Colossians) is widely debated. According to some scholars, Paul wrote the questionable letters with the help of a secretary, or amanuensis, who would have influenced their style, if not their theological content. The Epistle to the Hebrews, although it does not bear his name, was traditionally considered Pauline (although Rome questioned its authorship), but from the 16th century onwards opinion steadily moved against Pauline authorship and few scholars now ascribe it to Paul, mostly because it does not read like any of his other epistles in style and content and because the epistle does not indicate that Paul is the author, unlike the others.The Pauline epistles are usually placed between the Acts of the Apostles and the catholic epistles in modern editions. Most Greek manuscripts place the general epistles first, and a few minuscules (175, 325, 336, and 1424) place the Pauline epistles at the end of the New Testament.", "hasanswer": true}]}

However, in Garden of Shadows, it is spelled \"Corinne\". Garden of Shadows was written by ghostwriter Andrew Neiderman.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine and her four children arrive at Foxworth Hall in the month of June to August, yet in this book, light snow is falling when they arrive.\nThere is a slight confusion as to when the children arrived at Foxworth Hall. Cathy mentions that they had been in the attic for 3 years, 4 months, and 16 days (POTW- p 18). They left on 10 Nov 1960 meaning they arrived about 24 June 1957. Yet in Flowers in the Attic chapters \"Goodbye Daddy\" to \"Roads to Riches\", the dad dies in early May and it is implied that a few months passed before they abandoned the house in Gladstone. Also on page 231, it's mentioned that \"August had come and gone. We have been in this prison a full year.\"\nThe dollhouse that belongs to Olivia stays at her old house. There is no mention of it ever arriving at Foxworth Hall, as it does in Flowers in the Attic.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Christopher Sr. dies at age 36; in Garden of Shadows, he dies at age 35. (This may be because it was his birthday.)\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells her children that Olivia was abused by her mother (she was locked in a closet, causing Olivia's claustrophobia and unwillingness to go into the attic), while in \"Shadows\" Olivia recounts a warm and loving relationship with a gentle mother, and goes into the attic several times, especially once when she has Alicia captive in there. \"Shadows\" does mention that Olivia's mother locked her in the closet as punishment when she misbehaved.\nIn Garden of Shadows, Malcolm Jr. dies at Foxworth Hall in a motorcycle accident; in Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells her children that he died at a cabin he had built. Differences lie in the location of death and who was present. (However, it is possible that Corrine either misremembered the circumstances regarding her brother\u2019s death as it had been years between his passing and her confession, or she lied to her children.)\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells her children that Joel ran away from home and sent a single postcard, while in Garden of Shadows, Olivia mentions many newspaper clippings were sent home. Corrine recalls Joel saying goodbye to his parents, while she was not present in Garden of Shadows.\nIn Garden of Shadows, Olivia mentions her loving relationship with Corrine, while in Flowers in the Attic, Olivia proudly states that she thought Corrine to be trash from birth (although it is possible that she is lying or just disgusted by what Corrine did).\nIn Flowers in the Attic Olivia screams at Cathy and Chris that their parents eloped secretly and came back to ask forgiveness for falling in love. However, in Garden of Shadows, Olivia catches Christopher Sr. and Corrine making love.  This leads to a confrontation with Malcolm and Olivia, after which Christopher and Corrine willingly flee Foxworth Hall.\nIn Flowers in the Attic Corrine tells Cathy that she was 12, and out bike riding when she got her first period, while in Garden Of Shadows Corrine is 14 and proudly shares the news with her mother.\nGarden of Shadows does not mention Olivia's ever-present diamond brooch, nor any close friends that make her gray dresses (Flowers in the Attic). In fact, Garden of Shadows says that Olivia had no friends in Virginia, finding the women too weak, frivolous, and nasty for her liking.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, when confronted by Cathy, Corrine reveals that Malcolm wrote on a letter to her, in reply for her pleas for help after Chris Sr. dies, that the only thing good about their (Chris Sr. and Corrine's) marriage was the fact it didn't create any devil's issue (inbred children). In Garden of Shadows, Olivia says that she writes the letter, and Malcolm does not write anything on it. Also, Olivia does not let Malcolm know about the children, knowing that Malcolm would be bewitched by their beauty, especially the girls, and would not punish the children for the evil that their parents have done. (It is likely that Corrine may have been lying to keep her children under control and conspired with Olivia to keep Malcolm unaware of their existence.)\nOlivia's son Malcolm Jr. is nicknamed \"Mal\" to differentiate him from his father. The earlier books in the series stated that he was known as \"Mel.\"\nGarden of Shadows shows that John Amos meets Corrine for the first time when she is 14, while it is mentioned in If There be Thorns that she was 10.\nIn Garden of Shadows, Christopher is named Christopher Garland Foxworth. In Flowers in the Attic, his name is Garland Christopher Foxworth the Fourth.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells the children that her parents had forced her and her brothers to attend church every Sunday no matter what. In Garden of Shadows, there is no mention of the family ever attending church.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells the children that she and her brothers were forbidden from being exposed to each other, which includes swimming together because her mother said it was a sin and was abused if they disobeyed. In Garden of Shadows, Olivia does not mind it and even lets Corrine swim with Christopher. There is no mention of Corrine being abused but the boys are disciplined by their father who whips them and verbally abuses them.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Olivia expresses hatred towards her grandchildren because of their incestuous conception, even physically and emotionally abusing them. In Garden of Shadows, she feels drawn to them and actually wanted to love them, but decided against it because of what their parents had done. She may be keeping this in mind in her treatment of the children in the first novel.\nIn Flowers in the Attic and in previous novels, Corrine maintains that she was abused by her father. But in Garden of Shadows, Corrine was doted on and spoiled by her father. She may have reconsidered his treatment in retrospect.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine writes several letters to her parents asking for help.

{"id": "50_895", "question": "Who is the author of Sahara?", "ctxs": [{"id": "112_63188", "text": "Being a largely unlisted company Sahara India Parivar's activities have come under criticism largely because of legal issues it is facing.On 26 February 2014, the Supreme Court of India had issues warrants to summon Subrata Roy, Managing Worker, chairman and founder of Sahara India Pariwar, on a litigation on the Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures issued by the two companies of Sahara India Pariwar to which Securities and Exchange Board of India had claimed its jurisdiction and objected on why Sahara has not taken permission from it. Sahara has claimed that the said bonds are hybrid product, thus does not come under the jurisdiction of SEBI, instead is governed by Registrar of Companies (ROC) under Ministry of Corporate Affairs, from which the two companies of Sahara has already taken permission and submitted the red herring prospectus with ROC before issuing the bonds.\nSEBI in return ordered Sahara's two companies to stop issuing the said bonds and return money to investors. Sahara contested the case in various courts which eventually came to Supreme Court of India. On 14 June 2012, (during the final hearing of the case), the group had provided details of its financials up to 30 April 2012. While the court reserved its order, Sahara claims that it has already paid to 95% of the investors and discharged its OFCD liability to the tune of \u20b923,500 crore (US$2.9 billion) and only around \u20b92,260 crore (US$280 million) are left against which Sahara has already deposited more than \u20b912,000 crore (US$1.5 billion) which has with interest swelled to \u20b916,000 crore (US$2.0 billion). By 31 August 2012 the date of Supreme Court order, the group repaid majority of its OFCD investors between May the last date of hearing and by 30 August 2012 the final order. Since these repayments have not been taken into consideration, Sahara maintains that any money paid now will obviously mean a double payment towards one liability.\nIt is also been reported that Sahara has paid \u20b9725.9 crore (US$91 million) as TDS (tax deducted at source) to the Income Tax Departments on the interest which along with investment was repaid to 95 percent of the investors, between 2009\u201310 and 2012\u201313. The income tax authorities had found that the beneficiary investors were existent and accordingly confirmed the repayments made in those particular years. One of Sahara's arguments in the apex court revolves around the fact that if one government body has found investors, why can't the other.The case itself comprises big numbers such as collection of over \u20b924,000 crore (US$3.0 billion) from three crore individuals, while once in 2013 Sahara sent 127 trucks containing 31,669 cartons full of over three crore application forms and two crore redemption vouchers to SEBI office. Apparently, this had resulted into a huge traffic jam on outskirts of Mumbai, where the regulator is headquartered. SEBI on the other hand because the trucks reached after office hours SEBI rejected the second batch of files, which as per Sahara contained 25% of the investor information.Furthermore, the market regulator SEBI advertised four times in more than 144 newspapers to ask the investors of Sahara to refund the money. And since August 2012 Sebi has only refunded \u20b964 crore (US$8.0 million) to the investors while it has \u20b916,000 crore (US$2.0 billion) from Sahara. In October 2014, a shocking revelation was made when only around 4,600 investors in two Sahara group companies had come forward to claim refunds from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which had asked those who had purchased bonds issued by the entities to claim their money. This gave a valid point to Sahara's argument before courts that it had repaid most of the investors who had come forward to claim the investment which they had made in bonds issued by two group companies.He was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on 26 March 2014 on the condition that he would deposit the huge bail amount of \u20b910,000 crore (US$1.3 billion). Subrata was eventually taken into judicial custody and sent to Tihar jail, along with two other Sahara directors, on 4 March 2014 for failing to deposit \u20b910,000 crore (US$1.3 billion) with SEBI. In Tihar jail, Subrata unsuccessfully tried to sell some of his hotel properties to raise \u20b910,000 crore (US$1.3 billion) for his bail bond. He remained in Tihar jail for more than two years, and was released on parole in May 2016 to attend the last rites of his deceased mother.On 1 July 2018, the group revealed that majority of \u20b920,000 crore (US$2.5 billion) of Sahara's money (including the interest) which is with SEBI will be refunded back to Sahara India as the group had already made majority of the payments to its investors. The group also stated that SEBI will be directed to start the verification of the documents of Sahara's investors, which are already provided to them by Sahara India Pariwar.

Scholars note that Apuleius came from the Algerian city of M'Daourouch in Souk Ahras Province, where Augustine would later study. Augustine refers to Apuleius and The Golden Ass particularly derisively in The City of God.\nThe writing of William Shakespeare was influenced by The Golden Ass e.g. A Midsummer Night's Dream from c. 1595 where the character Bottom's head is transformed to that of an ass.In 1517, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli wrote his own version of the story, as a terza rima poem. It was uncompleted at the time of his death.In 1708, Charles Gildon published an adaptation of The Golden Ass, titled The New Metamorphosis. A year later in 1709, he published a re-adaptation, titled The Golden Spy, which is regarded as the first, fully-fledged it-narrative in English.In 1821, Charles Nodier published \"Smarra ou les Demons de la Nuit\" influenced by a reading of Apuleius.\nIn 1883, Carlo Collodi published The Adventures of Pinocchio which includes an episode in which the puppet protagonist is transformed into an ass. Another character who is transformed alongside him is named Lucignolo (Candlewick or Lampwick), a possible allusion to Lucius. The episode is frequently featured in its subsequent adaptations.\nIn 1915, Franz Kafka published the short story The Metamorphosis under a quite similar name, about a young man's unexpected transformation into an \"Ungeziefer\", a verminous bug.\nIn 1956, C. S. Lewis published the allegorical novel, Till We Have Faces, retelling the Cupid\u2013Psyche myth from books four through six of The Golden Ass from the point of view of Orual, Psyche's jealous ugly sister. The novel revolves upon the threat and hope of meeting the divine face to face. It has been called Lewis's \"most compelling and powerful novel\".In 1985, comic-book artist Georges Pichard adapted the text into a graphic novel titled Les Sorci\u00e8res de Thessalie.\nIn April 1999, the Canadian Opera Company produced an operatic version of The Golden Ass by Randolph Peters, the libretto of which was written by celebrated Canadian author Robertson Davies. An operatic production of The Golden Ass also appears as a plot device in Davies's novel A Mixture of Frailties (1958).\nIn 1999, comic-book artist Milo Manara adapted the text into a fairly abridged graphic novel version named Le metamorfosi o l'asino d'oro.\nIn the fantasy novel Silverlock by John Myers Myers, the character Lucius Gil Jones is a composite of Lucius, Gil Blas in Gil Blas by Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage, and Tom Jones in The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling by Henry Fielding.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The four freedoms refer to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's January 1941 Four Freedoms State of the Union address, in which he identified essential human rights that should be universally protected. The theme was incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and became part of the Charter of the United Nations. The paintings were reproduced in The Saturday Evening Post over four consecutive weeks in 1943, alongside essays by prominent thinkers of the day. They became the highlight of a touring exhibition sponsored by The Post and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The exhibition and accompanying sales drives of war bonds raised over $132 million.This series has been the cornerstone of retrospective art exhibits presenting the career of Rockwell, who was the most widely known and popular commercial artist of the mid-20th century, but did not achieve critical acclaim. These are among his best-known works, and by some accounts became his most widely distributed paintings. At one time they were commonly displayed in post offices, schools, clubs, railroad stations, and a variety of public and semi-public buildings.Critical review of these images, like most of Rockwell's work, has not been entirely positive. Rockwell's idyllic and nostalgic approach to regionalism made him a popular illustrator but a lightly regarded fine artist during his lifetime, a view still prevalent today.

One consequence was the rise of a new approach to marginalized communities, who were no longer perceived as \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d regions but rather as areas that were striving to overcome the negative impact colonization and imperialism had in the subcontinent.\nThis argument, later known as the Dependency theory, was presented by several authors but it was Galeano who shared the idea with the entire region.Mexican author Elena Poniatowska, winner of the 2013 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, said in an interview with BBC that what Galeano did in Open Veins had never been done before. \"He gathered thousands of the most forgotten voices of Latin America,\" Poniatowska stated.\nSimilarly, Jorge Volpi, another Mexican author, argued that Open Veins is one of the most influential texts written in Latin America during the twentieth-century and that \"it opened the eyes of many young writers and political activists regarding the exploitation of this [Latin America] part of the world.\"Open Veins also was and continues to be part of the battle of ideas that initiated during the Cold War, by becoming a symbol of opposition to the intervention of the United States and other foreign powers in Latin American affairs.\nIn the foreword to the 1997 edition, Isabel Allende stated that \"after the military coup of 1973 I could not take much with me: some clothes, family pictures, a small bag of dirt from my garden, and two books: an old edition of the Odes by Pablo Neruda and the book with the yellow cover, Las venas abiertas de Am\u00e9rica Latina\". Allende claims that the 1973 Military Coup against her uncle and leftist Chilean president Salvador Allende that gave rise to the long dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet could have been predicted based on Open Veins. The book, she argues, was proof that \"no safe islands\" existed in Latin America and that the government of Salvador Allende was \u201cdoomed from the beginning.\u201dVenezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez gave United States President Barack Obama a Spanish copy of Open Veins of Latin America as a gift at the 5th Summit of the Americas in 2009,\nas an attempt to reinvigorate the argument of the book. As a result of this international exposure, the book's sales rose sharply\u2014it was the 54,295th most popular book on Amazon.com before the event, but it became second a day later.\nIn the opinion of El Espectador the core ideas of Open Veins have not been able to retake the central position they once had in Latin American discussions of political economy and development.In the environmental context, some have argued that the continued exploitation of land for the benefit of a few demonstrates that the book remains relevant.\nThis argument is based on the first part of the book, \"Mankind\u2019s poverty as a consequence of the wealth of the land.\"Moreover, Galeano\u2019s 2014 renunciation of the book did not diminish the role it played in creating awareness about the inequality between the Global North-Global South interactions; scholars have argued that Open Veins had a part in encouraging movements of integration in the South, including the formation of MERCOSUR.Open Veins has also inspired numerous works of art and musical compositions. Among them: The Latin American Memorial in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, an art assemblage by artist Oscar Niemeyer from which a large sculpture of a left hand bleeding, representing the \u201copen veins of Latin America,\u201d stands out;\nand the song Las venas abiertas de Am\u00e9rica Latina by composer Caio Fac\u00f3, which touches upon the thematics of colonization in the cultural sphere.", "hasanswer": false}]}
