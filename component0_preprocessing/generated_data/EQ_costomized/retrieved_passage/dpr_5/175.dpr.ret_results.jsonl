It operated as an open-ended investment trust in Canada, and was one of the equities known as \"Canroys\" \u2013 short for \"Canadian royalty trusts.\"    In 2009 the Korea National Oil Corporation made a buyout offer for Harvest, which was accepted, with shareholder approval.  The trust was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2009.The former Harvest Energy Trust's oil fields are mainly in Alberta, with two in Saskatchewan; it also has assets in northern British Columbia known as the Hay River Field.  Oil sand deposits and all natural gas properties were in Alberta.  As of the end of 2007, Harvest claimed a production of 61,000 BOE/d (barrels or equivalent per day), and a probable lifespan of existing assets of about ten years, before depletion.  It claims a total original oil in place (OOIP) amount of 2 billion barrels (320,000,000 m3), and another 1 billion barrels (160,000,000 m3) in oil sands.  Future plans include drilling approximately 1,000 new oil and gas wells on about 880,000 acres (3,600 km2) of land which has previously not been developed for oil and gas production.Harvest Energy Trust was formed in July, 2002.  In 2006 it purchased the 115,000 bbl/d (18,300 m3/d) North Atlantic Refinery in Come By Chance, Newfoundland and Labrador from Vitol Refining Group, B.V., and in so doing became the first Canadian energy trust to own its own refinery.

Lyrically, the album focuses on Minogue's self-discovery after a series of trips worldwide and delves into freedom of expression, relationships, and emotions.\nUpon its release, critical and public reception of Impossible Princess was divided over its new musical direction and Minogue's intimate lyrics. Commercially, the album reached the top 10 in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom; the British media, however, mocked its lack of success in Europe. Four singles were released from the album, including two UK top-20 entries \"Did It Again\" and \"Breathe\". Minogue embarked on the Intimate and Live tour in 1998 to support the album.\nIn retrospect, various commentators have cited Impossible Princess as Minogue's most personal and misunderstood work. Despite this, Minogue has said she would never create another studio album of personal songs like Impossible Princess. To celebrate 25 years since the album's original release, it was released on vinyl for the first time in October 2022, leading to its resurgence and reaching new peaks on record charts.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_22550", "text": "Deconstruction planned to have the album out in January 1997, but postponed its release to May. Even with copies of the album already printed in mid-1997, it was delayed again to September. On 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car accident. Because of the impact of her death, Minogue and Deconstruction felt the album's title was inappropriate and delayed its release for three months. The album also missed the planned January 1998 release. Frustrated with the constant delays, Minogue came to an agreement with her label to re-title it Kylie Minogue in Europe and the United Kingdom. It is her third self-titled studio album, following her debut in 1988 and her 1994 album. Released on 28 March 1998, the album had the original cover design; the 1997 copyright year; and Minogue's tribute to Sednaoui in the credits, despite having ended their relationship in late 1997.\n\nOn 22 October 1997, Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG) released the album in the Japanese market, which included the bonus track \"Tears\". The following month, Impossible Princess was produced in both CD and cassette formats in Russia and Poland. The standard edition of Impossible Princess was finally made available in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in early January 1998, and was issued in Europe and the United Kingdom in March that year. The following month, BMG distributed it as a cassette tape in Malaysia, whilst the standard edition with new artwork was released in Taiwan. Deconstruction cancelled plans to release Impossible Princess in North America following the sudden closure of her US distributor Imago Records in late 1994.In May 2003, Impossible Princess was remastered by Festival Mushroom in Australia and New Zealand, and BMG for European and UK regions, as a double CD album; the release contained a bonus disc featured remixes and three unreleased recordings: \"Love Takes Over Me\", \"Tears\", and \"This Girl\". The album re-instated the Impossible Princess title in Europe and the United Kingdom upon its re-release. In October 2022, 25 years after its original release, BMG released the album for the first time on vinyl. Using its original title Impossible Princess, the 25th Anniversary edition was reissued with three different coloured wax pressings and a limited edition Picture Disc variant.Because of constant delays in 1997, Mushroom Records premiered six of the album tracks\u2014\"Some Kind of Bliss\", \"Too Far\", \"Say Hey\", \"Limbo\", \"I Don't Need Anyone\", and \"Did It Again\"\u2014on a special sample compact disc in Australia. Deconstruction conducted a similar promotional campaign in Europe and distributed six different songs on a sample cassette tape. Live and Other Sides was released accompanied by Australian releases of the album at HMV in 1998, with two unreleased Impossible Princess tracks, one unreleased Kylie Minogue track, and three live tracks. Another EP, Other Sides, featured the two B-sides, \"Love Takes Over Me\" and \"Tears\" and an unreleased Impossible Princess track, \"Take Me with You\". Minogue's fourth remix album, Mixes, includes singles from the album; it was released in the UK in August 1998. In Australia, the remix album was replaced by Impossible Remixes, featuring the previously unreleased \"Breathe (TNT Club Mix)\".

The following year, Minogue was nominated for Best Female Artist for \"Cowboy Style\", which lost to Imbruglia's \"Wishing I Was There\" (1998). The music video for \"Did It Again\" won the 1998 International Viewer's Choice Award \u2013 MTV Australia.Because of pressure from the British press and public, Minogue contemplated retiring from the music industry for good. She decided instead to part with Deconstruction and BMG in November 1998. In 1999, Minogue signed to Parlophone and released her studio album Light Years in 2000 to a positive reception. The Guardian's Tim Jonze believes that Light Years saved her career, while Louise Bruton of The Irish Times, said that Impossible Princess is the low point \"she needed to reach the great heights of 2000's Light Years\". Minogue has considered Impossible Princess the most disappointing moment in her career, and commented that if she wrote another album of personal songs, \"it would be seen as Impossible Princess 2 and be equally critiqued\".Retrospectively, the album has been regarded by music critics as Minogue's most personal and misunderstood work. True and Cinquemani applauded her writing contribution, calling it her \"great leap forward\" in terms of musical composition. On the 20th anniversary of the album, Ben Neutze of Daily Review opined that it stands as \"the most intriguing chapter of her career, and the only significant glimpse at who this pop icon might be when stripped of other glorious facades.\" Caz Tran of ABC Online called it \"the creative detour [Minogue] needed to take\" regarding her evolution and self-discovery. Levine and Larrisa Dubecki of The Age viewed the album as one of the key re-inventions of her recording career. Several critics noticed the sonic and lyrical similarities between the album and Ray of Light (1998) by Madonna. Cinquemani observed that despite the success of Ray of Light, Impossible Princess brought a harsh reaction from the public. Owen Myers of Pitchfork described both albums, alongside Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope (1997), as \"a trilogy of A-list experimental pop records in 1997-8 that addressed their artists\u2019 fears, anxieties, and dreams.\" Media publications Flavorwire, Slant Magazine, and Faster Louder listed the album as one of the most underrated pop albums.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "26_50437", "text": "The 2005 CBS miniseries Elvis includes the story of her affair with Elvis Presley during the filming of Viva Las Vegas.

The song also states that man made toys for the baby boys and girls, and comments about the fact that \"Man makes money\" to buy from other men. Before the song's fade, Brown states that man is lost in his bitterness and in the wilderness. Brown's co-writer and onetime girlfriend, Betty Jean Newsome, wrote the lyrics based on her own observations of the relations between the sexes. Newsome claimed in later years that Brown did not write any part of the song, and she argued in court that he sometimes forgot to pay her royalties. In May 1966, Record World magazine reported that Brown, King Records and Dynatone Publishing were being sued by Clamike Records for alleged copyright infringement of the Betty Newsome song \"It's a Man's World (But What Would He Do Without a Woman)\".The composition of \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" developed over a period of several years. Tammy Montgomery, better known as Tammi Terrell, recorded \"I Cried\", a Brown-penned song based on the same chord changes, in 1963. Brown himself recorded a demo version of the song, provisionally entitled \"It's a Man's World\", in 1964. This version later appeared on the CD compilations The CD of JB and Star Time.\nThe released version of \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" was recorded quickly, in only two takes, with a studio ensemble that included members of Brown's touring band and a string section arranged and conducted by Sammy Lowe. A female chorus was involved in the recording sessions, but their parts were edited out of the song's final master.\"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" became a staple of Brown's live shows for the rest of his career. Its slow, simmering groove and declamatory vocal line made it suitable for long, open-ended performances incorporating spoken ruminations on love and loss and sometimes interpolations from other songs. It appears on almost all of Brown's live albums starting with 1967's Live at the Garden. Brown also recorded a big band jazz arrangement of the song with the Louie Bellson Orchestra for his 1970 album Soul on Top.\nCash Box described the song as a \"slow-shufflin\u2019 emotion-charged item which points out that men are quite incomplete without women to love \u2019em.\"In 2004, \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" was ranked number 123 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.\nIn 2010, the 1966 recording of the song by James Brown on King Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_22572", "text": "Neneh Cherry released the answer song \"Woman\" on her 1996 album Man in response to the chauvinism of the original.\nThe band Napalm Death released the song \"It's a M.A.N.S World!\", which attacks and parodies the ideas of chauvinism and patriarchy ideas, on their 1988 album From Enslavement to Obliteration.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Remarkably, every track on this, Britt's second album, has the potential to become a US/UK mainstream number one hit with sufficient airplay. That success is beginning to show with the album and the title track single both hitting number one on the US Christian charts. With slightly breathy, sultry, intimate verses balanced with powerful choruses, each song radiates such positivity that you wonder how they managed to get the rainbows and sunshine packaged in.\" Eden wrote \"Musically targeted at excitable teenage girls, the Christian aspect is brilliantly natural and portrays God as a normal integrated part of any teenager's life without dumbing down or hyped worship and is a major credit to Britt's songwriting. As a pop album it fits into a mainstream genre and consequently sounds similar to singers like Avril Lavigne, which is no bad thing.\"Jesus Freak Hideout's Nathaniel Schexnayder wrote that \"despite some clich\u00e9 lyrics and the absence of more straight-up terrific highlights, The Lost Get Found is a fun album which definitely is a solid follow up to Say It. But even though the pop dance tunes are catchy, Meyers and many other pop-flair dependent artists routinely produce similar ear candy. The blend of youth and a refined pop beat combined on the title track is likely the direction where Britt Nicole should go in order to stand-out more. After all, that's how the good get better.\"Louder Than the Music's Suzanne Physick said \"Every once in a while you find a track that perfectly sums up something you have been trying to say for ages but have never managed to find the words. For me, Have Your Way is that track. It is the perfect pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

The band was experimentally progressive, as they were one of the earliest groups to record psychedelic music, before it was adapted by a wider array of musical acts.  Although their only album failed to achieve success, it later gained acclaim for being considered the earliest work to reference \"psychedelic\" in its title.Information on the band is sparse as only one band member had a confirmed musical career prior to recording. The member, Rusty Evans (born Marcus Uzilevsky, 1937, New York City, died December 5, 2015, Woodacre, California), was the Deep's lead guitarist, primary songwriter, and a vocalist.  Evans initially recorded in 1958 as a rockabilly singer, before performing as a Greenwich Village folk musician in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  He recorded three albums as Rusty Evans \u2013 Songs of Our Land, Railroad Songs (both 1964) and Live at Gerde's Folk City (1965) \u2013 and was later a member of the folk group The New Christy Minstrels. Musician David Bromberg is also known to have played on The Deep's one and only album, although it is unknown on which tracks he played.In the early summer of 1966, Evans convinced producer Mark Barkan to help him record a psychedelic album.  They secured arrangements with the Philadelphia-based Cameo-Parkway label, the home for fellow protopunk act Question Mark and the Mysterians, for a meager budget of $1200.  In August, Evans and Barkan assembled a group of New York musicians to record as the Deep, and they drove in a rundown car to Philadelphia to record what would become the Psychedelic Moods album, which was done in the short period of four days and would necessitate late-night sessions in order to be finished on time.  The all-night sessions also provided the musicians, who were unable to afford a hotel, with a place to sleep.While the exact release date of the album has yet to be definitively established, the record is generally considered to have been distributed in October 1966, based on the album's catalogue number. This would credit it as the first official album to include the word \"psychedelic\" in its title, pre-dating the Blues Magoos' debut, Psychedelic Lollipop, and The 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. The Deep's Psychedelic Moods did not sell well, and the group did not tour to support it. They existed as a studio-only band, and, aside from sessions for their album, produced no other recordings under that name.Evans left Cameo-Parkway to record a new album for the Columbia Records label in 1967. Abandoning the \"Deep\" name, this second album was credited to the band The Freak Scene and entitled Psychedelic Psoul. Despite the name change, the band still contained the original lineup from the first album, and the sound of this album is very similar to that of Psychedelic Moods. It is typically considered a follow-up in all but name. As its title suggests, Psychedelic Psoul is composed of psychedelic-influenced tracks as the band continued to develop past concepts from their debut album. However, The Freak Scene's album met the same results as Psychedelic Moods. They did not tour, and their album did not chart. The album has been rereleased by Sony BMG through Columbia Records on vinyl. The group disbanded in late 1967.After this venture, Evans returned to performing as a solo musician. He recorded under his birthname, Marcus, for a self-titled album in 1969, which produced compositions conceived as psychedelic folk in nature. He did not record another album until 1979, when he released Life's Railway Heaven, another folk effort. Evans recorded sporadically until his death, usually in the style of folk or rockabilly music,  and in the 1990s released two new age CDs, Slice of Light and Gypsy Dreams, credited as Uzca.  He also led a Johnny Cash tribute band.  Under his real name of Marcus Uzilevsky, he was a respected visual artist best known for his landscape paintings, and was exhibited widely in California.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_22557", "text": "\"Bury the Shovel\" is a song written by Chris Arms and Chuck Jones, and recorded by American country music singer Clay Walker.

It was originally released as the final track on his fifth album, The River.  The version released on The River was recorded at The Power Station in New York in March\u2013April 1980.  As well as being the last track on The River, it was the last song recorded for the album.A melancholic song with a false ending, \"Wreck on the Highway\" features prominent organ and acoustic guitar parts.  The song is structured as a folk ballad with four verses of five lines each.  The rhyme scheme of the verse endings is generally ABCCB, but this is not followed absolutely strictly.  The lyrics describe a man who witnesses a hit-and-run auto accident on a rainy, isolated highway, and is subsequently haunted by the vision and unable to sleep.  After the first three verses focus on the specific incident, the last verse broadens the theme to encompass more universal themes of life and death.  The singer thinks about the life that was lost, and the people who may have loved him, and he knows he will be haunted by the incident for the rest of his life.  Springsteen has explained the theme by stating that after seeing the accident the singer \"realizes that you have a limited number of opportunities to love someone, to do your work, to be part of something, to parent your children, to do something good.\"  It is directly inspired by Roy Acuff's country song of the same name and similar theme from the 1940s, which is a cover version of the 1938 recorded song, \"I Didn't Hear Nobody Pray\", by the Dixon Brothers. While Springsteen's song has elements of a country arrangement, its music is more haunted and less sentimental.Along with the title track, \"Independence Day\" and \"Point Blank\", it is one of the verse-chorus songs on The River that was essentially a short story or character sketch. \"Wreck on the Highway\" and a few other songs on The River, such as the title track and \"Stolen Car\", mark a new direction in Bruce Springsteen's songwriting: these ballads imbued with a sense of hopelessness anticipate his next album, Nebraska, as well as a turn towards pessimism in his overall artistic and personal world-view. Springsteen himself has noted that \"Wreck on the Highway\" is one of the songs reflecting a shift in his songwriting style, linking The River to Nebraska.A slow-tempo song, \"Wreck on the Highway\" has not been particularly common in concert, with about 100 performances in Bruce Springsteen concerts through 2008.  Nearly all of those performances occurred during the 1980\u20131981 River Tour. The song was revived occasionally for electric piano performances on the 2005 solo Devils & Dust Tour.

Heylin also described the song as Springsteen's \"semi-ironic farewell to albums about cars and girls.\"  Music critic Dave Marsh describes the song as an appropriate closer for The River as it \"pares down the situation from 'Drive All Night'\" of the singer and his lover trying to ignore the distractions around them down \"to one man facing the world again.\"  To Marsh, the singer in \"Wreck on the Highway\" may well have been the hero from other songs on The River such as \"Ramrod,\" \"Cadillac Ranch,\" \"The River\" or \"Stolen Car,\" or even the heroes from earlier Springsteen albums such as Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town, but regardless Marsh feels that \"he sees and speaks and sings for all of them.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39747", "text": "Larry Cordle (born November 16, 1948) is an American country and bluegrass singer-songwriter\n.

For his next release Phillips committed to a full, standard album, his first since 1984 (1981). At this point in his career, Phillips was pressured by management at his record label, the independent US-based Passport Records, to deliver more commercial and radio friendly songs. Also in early 1982, he had bought a house in Clapham, south London and has since called Invisible Men his \"mortgage album\". He set up studio in his home which he named Englewood Studios, and did additional recording in Atmosphere Studios in central London. To help him with the project, Phillips invited musician and songwriter Richard Scott to assist in its production. In a later interview, Phillips acknowledged Scott's confidence and enthusiasm, but noted that this would sometimes result in Phillips being pushed into musical areas where he was uneasy, perhaps due to Scott's inexperience, having recently graduated from university and wanting to make a career out of music. When it came to the vocals, Phillips was inspired to take them on himself as former Genesis band mates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks had done vocals on their solo albums, and that he was unable to find someone suitable. Phillips had used different guest singers on Sides (1979), but felt that it did not work as well as he had expected. Feeling his vocals were inadequate, Phillips took singing lessons from John Owen-Edwards, who had worked with him on a musical project and had also coached Rutherford.After the backing tracks and rough vocals had been put down for about five songs, Phillips presented his work to his manager Tony Smith and recalled that he was \"extremely impressed\". This was when Phillips was enthusiastic about the album until it became increasingly difficult for him to maintain such a level of interest. During recording at Atmosphere Studios, session drummers were brought in to play parts originally programmed on a drum machine as well as singers for additional vocals. Phillips wrote about this period: \"The money was flowing out. It wasn't a wholly happy time.\" In addition, pressure was placed upon him to change his image and to present the album under the name Anthony Phillips Band, something with which he did not agree.Invisible Men was cut by Ian Cooper at Townhouse Studios in London. Phillips encountered problems in finalising the album's release in the US as Passport rejected two cuts that Cooper had prepared, coupled with the opinion that none of the songs were suitable for a single. After the second cut was rejected, Phillips recalled that Cooper \"was a bit beside himself - he just didn't know what else to do\", and received notes from the label's engineer in New York with suggestions to improve it, with which Phillips expressed some disagreement.

He was the spiritual successor of the 23rd Tirthankara Parshvanatha. Mahavira was born in the early 6th century BCE into a royal Jain family of ancient India. His mother's name was Trishala and his father's name was Siddhartha. They were lay devotees of Parshvanatha. Mahavira abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of about 30 and left home in pursuit of spiritual awakening, becoming an ascetic. Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities for twelve and a half years, after which he attained Kevala Jnana (omniscience). He preached for 30 years and attained moksha (liberation) in the 6th century BCE, although the year varies by sect.\nMahavira taught that observance of the vows of ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) are necessary for spiritual liberation. He taught the principles of Anekantavada (many-sided reality): syadvada and nayavada. Mahavira's teachings were compiled by Indrabhuti Gautama (his chief disciple) as the Jain Agamas. The texts, transmitted orally by Jain monks, are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st century CE. \nMahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture, with the symbol of a lion beneath him. His earliest iconography is from archaeological sites in the North Indian city of Mathura, and is dated from between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE. His birth is celebrated as Mahavir Janma Kalyanak and his nirvana (salvation) and also his first shishya of Gautama Swami is observed by Jains as Diwali.\nHistorically, Mahavira, who revived and preached Jainism in ancient India, was an older contemporary of Gautama Buddha.

It provides text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools. Perl is a highly expressive programming language: source code for a given algorithm can be short and highly compressible.Perl gained widespread popularity in the mid-1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its powerful regular expression and string parsing abilities. In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs.

He reflects about his inadequacy in love and inability to fit in at home or with the other tickets and faces within the Mod subculture. The song also speaks to Townshend's growing alienation from his band and the music scene as a whole. As such, it serves as a telling sign of the years to come and the state of the Who during and directly after this period.\n\nArriving at Brighton, Jimmy brightens up a bit...get the pun?

New Order were formed in 1980 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The group began life as a continuation of their former incarnation Joy Division. Joy Division had disbanded after the death of the lead singer Ian Curtis. Gillian Gilbert, who was Morris's girlfriend at the time, soon joined the group and played guitar and keyboards.\nRemarkably, New Order's first eight singles released between 1981 and 1984 were not taken from any album. In most cases they were not even released as a 7-inch, but exclusively available in the radio-unfriendly 12-inch format, an unusual approach for a pop-act in the eighties.\nDespite the high anticipation that surrounded the group, their debut single \"Ceremony\" only peaked at number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The group's following two singles and their debut album met with similar moderate success. It would not be until the release of their fourth single, \"Blue Monday\", that New Order would break into the top 10, with the song peaking at number 9. \"Blue Monday\" became a defining single for the group and caused a sensation, becoming the biggest selling 12-inch single of all time.New Order, like many other post-punk groups of the period, increasingly utilised keyboards, drum machine and sequencers in their music. As a result, they became associated with the synthpop and electronic dance movements of the 1980s. Beginning with Power, Corruption & Lies from 1983, all of the group's studio albums reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The group experienced a lull in popularity in the years 1985 and 1986 but the surprise international popularity of the \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" single re-launched the group across the world. The group cemented their success in 1987 with the single, \"True Faith\", and the compilation album Substance.\nNew Order were at the peak of their popularity in the years 1987 to 1993, with a run of popular singles, including \"Blue Monday 1988\", \"Fine Time\", \"Regret\", \"World (The Price of Love)\" and in 1990 they scored their only number 1 single in the UK with the official England national football team song, \"World in Motion\". The two albums released during these years, Technique and Republic; each charted at number 1 in the UK. It was during this successful period that the group's internal dynamic began to falter. Sumner was not fond of touring, and wanted to take time off from the group and produce a solo album. He formed Electronic with Johnny Marr and the pair released their first single in 1989. Hook formed his own band, Revenge, in 1989, while Morris and Gilbert worked together as The Other Two, primarily scoring soundtracks. Of the three side projects, Sumner's was by far the most successful.\nThe recording and touring of 1993's Republic, their first for London Records, was difficult and intra-band tensions were rife. The group went on hiatus until 1998. In the meantime two compilation albums, The Best of New Order and The Rest of New Order, and several singles were released.\nThe group reconvened in 1998 for the Reading Festival but did not release new material until 2000. The group released the album Get Ready in 2001. It was met with critical warmth, but it was apparent that the group's popularity had lessened. The lead single from the album, \"Crystal\", reached the top 10 in the UK. The film 24 Hour Party People, a humorous chronicle of their label Factory Records, was released in 2002. New Order contributed a new song, \"Here to Stay\", and a re-recording of the Joy Division song \"New Dawn Fades\" with Moby, for the film's soundtrack. The compilation International and four-disc boxset Retro were released in winter 2002. New Order followed Get Ready with Waiting for the Sirens' Call in 2005. During this period Gilbert stepped down from live performances due to family commitments. Phil Cunningham stepped into her role and in 2005 became an official member of the group.\nThe group had intended to release a ninth album soon after Waiting for the Sirens' Call, the majority of which had already been recorded. The lack of enthusiasm inside the group and relative failure of Waiting for the Sirens' Call stalled their career momentum. In 2007, Hook decided to leave the group, and stated that he and Sumner had no further plans to work together. Sumner formed Bad Lieutenant with Cunningham, and Hook formed Freebass. Morris continued to work with Sumner and Cunningham. In 2008, New Order released remastered and expanded editions of their first five albums with the intention of releasing the further three albums in a similar format in the future.\nLost Sirens was released in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2013. It is an eight-track album of tracks left out of Waiting for the Sirens' Call. On 25 September 2015, the band released a new album, Music Complete. The album was the first without Peter Hook, and was produced mostly by the band themselves, except \"Singularity\" and \"Unlearn This Hatred\", both produced by Tom Rowlands, while \"Superheated\" features additional production by Stuart Price.

In 2001, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.In 2020, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".

In Final Fantasy VII, Cloud is a mercenary who wields a large broadsword and claims to have formerly been part of SOLDIER, a group of elite supersoldiers employed by the Shinra Electric Power Company, a megacorporation responsible for draining life from the planet. He later defected from SOLDIER after becoming disillusioned with Shinra, and in an attempt to get paid, he joins the resistance group AVALANCHE in the fight against Shinra and his former superior, the primary antagonist Sephiroth, who aims to annihilate the world. Over the course of the story, it is eventually revealed that Cloud is a mentally-scarred individual who adopted the skill and personality of an actual SOLDIER, the deceased Zack Fair, and is actually little more than a Shinra foot soldier, but learns to accept his troubled past and his own identity in order to defeat Sephiroth and save the world.\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 computer-animated sequel film, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, in which he fights a new threat composed of a trio attacking his allies while also dealing with a terminal illness called \"Geostigma\". He acts in a supporting role in other Compilation of Final Fantasy VII titles, and is featured in several other games in the wider Final Fantasy series. He has also made guest appearances in various titles outside the franchise, such as the Kingdom Hearts series by Square Enix and Disney and the Super Smash Bros. series by Nintendo.\nCloud was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, a character artist for the Final Fantasy series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. Yoshinori Kitase, director of VII, and Kazushige Nojima, one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After VII, Nomura redesigned Cloud for Advent Children, giving him a more realistic appearance alongside new weaponry and a new outfit. For Remake, the team aimed to adapt his classic design for a more realistic artstyle.\nCloud has garnered primarily positive reception from critics, and has been described as one of the most iconic video game protagonists. He has also been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first unreliable narrators and for the game's depiction of his mental disorder. Additionally, he is seen as a messiah figure in both the game and film for opposing Sephiroth's schemes and supported by his allies. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by Famitsu, Guinness, and other organizations. His characterization and design have also influenced other characters, most notably Lightning from Final Fantasy XIII. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as action figures and jewelry. Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors, with Steve Burton and Cody Christian's English vocal performances being the subject of praise.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23664", "text": "\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "170_16148", "text": "In contrast to Final Fantasy VI, which featured multiple \"main characters\", Square's staff decided in the beginning of Final Fantasy VII's development that the game would follow a single identifiable protagonist. In Hironobu Sakaguchi's first plot treatment, a prototype for Cloud's character belonged to an organization attempting to destroy New York City's \"Mako Reactors\". Kitase and Nomura discussed that Cloud would be the lead of three protagonists, but Nomura did not receive character profiles or a completed scenario in advance. Left to imagine the stories behind the characters he designed, Nomura shared these details in discussions with staff or in separately penned notes. Frustrated by the continued popularity of Final Fantasy IV's characters despite the release of two sequels, Nomura made it his goal to create a memorable cast. The contrast between Cloud, a \"young, passionate boy\", and Sephiroth, a \"more mature and cool\" individual, struck Amano as \"intriguing\", though not unusual as a pairing. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura imagined a rivalry mirroring that of Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojir\u014d, with Cloud and Sephiroth representing Musashi and Kojir\u014d, respectively.Kitase and Nojima developed Cloud's backstory and his relationship to Sephiroth. While drafting the game's scenario, Nojima saw a standing animation created by event planner Motomu Toriyama that depicted \"Cloud showing off\". The animation impressed Nojima and inspired the idea that Cloud had developed a false persona. This later led Nojima to create Zack Fair, a SOLDIER whom Cloud aspired to be like, to expand on the mystery of Cloud's past. Nojima left the unfolding of events regarding Cloud's identity unwritten, and Kitase was unaware of the significance of Zack's addition until playtesting. Kitase reviewed Nojima's scenario and felt that Cloud, who was neither single-minded nor righteous, offered a fresh take on a protagonist. The love triangle between Cloud, Tifa Lockhart, and Aerith Gainsborough was also viewed as novel for the series. Nojima likened Cloud and Tifa's relationship to one of friends since nursery school, and compared Aerith to a transfer student arriving mid-term.In early scripts, Sephiroth would have deceived Cloud into thinking that he had created him, and he had the ability to exert control over Cloud's movements. As in the finished game, Cloud would discover that Shinra's experiments and his own insecurities had made him susceptible to Sephiroth's manipulation. Cloud would have also somehow injured Tifa prior to the game's events, leaving her with memory loss of the event and a large scar on her back. Kitase rejected a proposed scene written by Masato Kato involving Cloud and Tifa walking out of a Chocobo stable the morning before the final battle, with Tifa following only after checking around. Kitase found it \"too intense\" and Nojima described the proposal as \"extreme\"; however, Kitase maintained a toned-down scene written by Kato depicting the night before, which has Tifa speak a risqu\u00e9 line of dialogue before a fade to black. According to Nojima, none of the staff expected that the scene, despite \"the line in question\", \"would be something so important\".Nojima wanted to write scenes in such a way that players themselves could decide what Cloud was thinking. Nojima used Cloud's foggy memories as a device to provide details about the world that would be unknown to the player but considered common knowledge to its inhabitants. To emphasize Cloud's personality, event planners repeated elements they found interesting, such as Toriyama's standing animation and Cloud's use of the phrase \"not interested\".In retrospective, Nomura and Final Fantasy VII Remake co-director Naoki Hamaguchi have described Cloud as a \"dorky character\". According to Nomura, although post-Final Fantasy VII titles featuring Cloud have emphasized his \"cool side\", \"in the original game, Cloud had many comical or lame moments\". Nomura believes that the reason Cloud became popular with audiences is due to the impact his personality made on Nojima's scenario.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, similar to the conception and recording of Let's Get It On, Gaye had struggled to come up with an album as an appropriate follow-up. And much like Let's Get It On Gaye reached for outside help, this time seeking the assistance of Leon Ware, a singer and songwriter who had found previous success writing hits for fellow Motown alum, including pop singer Michael Jackson and the rhythm and blues group The Miracles. Ware had been working on songs for his own album which he would later issue under the title Musical Massage, a collection of erotic singles Ware had composed with a variety of writers, including Jacqueline Hillard and Arthur \"T-Boy\" Ross, brother of Diana Ross. When Motown CEO Berry Gordy paid a visit to Ware, the songwriter was more than happy to play Gordy his selection of tracks. After hearing a preliminary mix of the songs however, Gordy figured that Ware should let Gaye handle his material.While the majority of the album's songs were conceived by Ware, I Want You was transformed into a biographical centerpiece for Gaye, who was then in a volatile marriage with Anna Gordy, sister to Berry Gordy, and also in a long-standing affair with Janis Hunter, who would later become the mother of his two youngest children. Gaye and Hunter were introduced to each other by producer Ed Townsend in 1973 at Hitsville West, while Townsend and Gaye were recording Let's Get It On. Hunter was 17 years old while Gaye was seventeen years her senior at the time Townsend introduced them. In his book Mercy, Mercy Me: The Art, Loves, and Demons of Marvin Gaye, the author and music writer Michael Eric Dyson elaborated on the relationship between I Want You and Gaye's affair with Hunter:\n\n\"I Want You is unmistakably a work of romantic and erotic tribute to the woman he deeply loved and would shortly marry, Janis Hunter. Gaye's obsession with the woman in her late teens is nearly palpable in the sensual textures that are the album's aural and lyrical signature. Their relationship was relentlessly passionate and emotionally rough-hewn; they played up each other's strengths, and played off each other's weaknesses.\"\nThough it was often hinted that Let's Get It On was the album Gaye had dedicated to her, Marvin has stated that this album was dedicated to Hunter, who is believed to have been in the studio when he recorded it. According to music critics, her presence may have increased the emotion in Ware's and Gaye's conception of I Want You. From Gaye's first recordings of I Want You to the album's release in 1976, Hunter and Gaye married and divorced in the span of three short years. Having gone mostly silent since the years of Gaye's death, Janis broke her silence in 2013 by releasing a book titled, After the Dance: My Life with Marvin Gaye where she recalls her turbulent and often violent relationship with Marvin.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53605", "text": "\"You Make Me Wanna...\" was distributed by LaFace Records and Arista Records.

The rest of the material was written and recorded in 1994 in sessions in Seattle, Washington and Atlanta, Georgia, with the band finishing the album at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle after the tour's completion. \"Immortality\" was written in April 1994 when the band was on tour in Atlanta. Sources state that most of the album was completed by early 1994, but it was not released until November due to either a forced delay by Epic or the band's battle with ticket vendor Ticketmaster.Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by the time they were working on Vitalogy. Producer Brendan O'Brien said: \"Vitalogy was a little strained. I'm being polite\u2014there was some imploding going on.\" Bassist Jeff Ament said that \"communication was at an all-time low\". Drummer Dave Abbruzzese stated that the communication problems started once guitarist Stone Gossard stopped acting as the band's mediator. According to Gossard, Vitalogy was the first album for which lead vocalist Eddie Vedder made the final decisions. At the time, Gossard thought of quitting the band. Gossard said the band was having trouble collaborating, so most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. He added that \"80 percent of the songs were written 20 minutes before they were recorded.\" During the production of Vitalogy, lead guitarist Mike McCready went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for alcohol and cocaine abuse.Drums on \"Satan's Bed\" were performed by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On the day it was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as \"Jimmy\". Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for Vitalogy, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with other band members. Gossard said: \"It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason, his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled.\" Jack Irons, the original drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\".

She also performed the role in a film of the production and as her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1965.

She studied voice first with her uncle, Dante Arcelli, then with Luigi Bertazzoni and Ettore Campogalliani. She later changed her name thinking it was easier to pronounce. Freni made her operatic debut at the Teatro Municipale in her hometown on 3 March 1955 as Mica\u00ebla in Bizet's Carmen. She later married her teacher, the pianist and director Leone Magiera; the couple had a daughter. Freni resumed her career in 1958 when she performed Mim\u00ec in Puccini's La boh\u00e8me at the Teatro Regio in Turin, and sang in De Nederlandse Opera's 1959\u201360 season. Her international breakthrough came at the Glyndebourne Festival, where she appeared in 1960 as Zerlina in Mozart's Don Giovanni, alongside Joan Sutherland as Donna Anna, and in 1962 as Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro, and as Adina in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, directed by Franco Zeffirelli.In 1961, Freni first performed at the Royal Opera House in London as Nannetta in Verdi's Falstaff. She stepped in as Nannetta at La Scala in Milan for Renata Scotto. On 31 January 1963, she appeared there as Mim\u00ec in a production staged by Franco Zeffirelli and conducted by Herbert von Karajan. She became one of the conductor 's favourite singers in operas and concerts. The production was repeated at the Vienna State Opera the same year, and she appeared at the house in eleven roles, including the title role of Puccini's Manon Lescaut, and Amelia in Verdi's Simon Boccanegra.\nOn 29 September 1965, she first appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, again as Mim\u00ec, with Gianni Raimondi as Rodolfo who also made his house debut. Reviewer Alan Rich wrote in the New York Herald Tribune:Miss Freni is\u2014well, \"irresistible\" will do for a start. Beautiful to look at, and actress of simple naturalness and overwhelming intelligence, she used voice and gesture to create a Mim\u00ec of ravishing femininity and grace. The voice itself is pure and fresh, operating without seam from bottom to top, marvelously colored at every point by what seems to be an instinctive response to the urging of the text. She later appeared there as Adina in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, Li\u00f9 in Puccini's Turandot, Marguerite in Gounod's Faust, Juliette in Rom\u00e9o et Juliette, as Susanna, Micaela and Manon Lescaut. The following year she sang Mim\u00ec again for her Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company debut, with Flaviano Lab\u00f2 as Rodolfo. From the early 1970s into the 1980s, Freni sang heavier Verdi roles, including Elisabetta in John Dexter's production of Don Carlos, Desdemona in Otello (alongside Jon Vickers), Amelia in Simon Boccanegra, Elvira in the Luca Ronconi staging of Ernani, Leonora in La forza del destino, and the title role of Aida performed in the Houston Grand Opera in 1987. She appeared as Puccini's Tosca only on a recording. She performed as Manon Lescaut in the Metropolitan Opera's 1990 season, and recorded Madama Butterfly and the three roles of Il trittico.Freni chose her roles carefully, saying in an interview: \"I am generous in many ways, but not when I think it will destroy my voice. Some singers think they are gods who can do everything. But I have always been honest with myself and my possibilities.\" She refused Karajan's offers of Leonora in Verdi's Il trovatore and the title role in Puccini's Turandot. Elvira in Ernani was set aside after a single run at La Scala (and despite offers to sing the role elsewhere). She never sang Cio-Cio-San on stage, but recorded it twice, not including the 1975 film Madama Butterfly, alongside Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, with Karajan conducting and Jean-Pierre Ponnelle directing. She played Susanna in the Ponnelle film Le nozze di Figaro, which also featured Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Kiri Te Kanawa and Hermann Prey.In 1978, after her marriage to Magiera had ended in divorce, she married Nicolai Ghiaurov, one of the leading operatic basses of the post-war period. Together they helped to establish the Centro Universale del Bel Canto in Vignola, where they began giving master classes in 2002. After Ghiaurov's death in 2004, Freni continued their work of preserving the bel canto tradition, teaching young singers from around the world.Freni extended her repertoire and style during the 1990s with Italian Verismo, taking on the title roles of Francesco Cilea's Adriana Lecouvreur in Milan, Paris, Barcelona and New York, and Umberto Giordano's Fedora in London, Milan, New York, Torino, Barcelona and Z\u00fcrich. In 1997, she performed Giordano's Madame Sans-G\u00eane at the Teatro Massimo Bellini. During this time she sang in Russian operas, such as Tchaikovsky's Tatiana in Eugene Onegin, Lisa in The Queen of Spades, and Ioanna in The Maid of Orleans. Freni ended her professional career on stage, performing teenager Ioanna at the age of 70 at the Washington National Opera on 11 April 2005.Freni died on 9 February 2020 at her home in Modena. According to her manager, she died \"after a long degenerative illness and a series of strokes\".

However, similar to the conception and recording of Let's Get It On, Gaye had struggled to come up with an album as an appropriate follow-up. And much like Let's Get It On Gaye reached for outside help, this time seeking the assistance of Leon Ware, a singer and songwriter who had found previous success writing hits for fellow Motown alum, including pop singer Michael Jackson and the rhythm and blues group The Miracles. Ware had been working on songs for his own album which he would later issue under the title Musical Massage, a collection of erotic singles Ware had composed with a variety of writers, including Jacqueline Hillard and Arthur \"T-Boy\" Ross, brother of Diana Ross. When Motown CEO Berry Gordy paid a visit to Ware, the songwriter was more than happy to play Gordy his selection of tracks. After hearing a preliminary mix of the songs however, Gordy figured that Ware should let Gaye handle his material.While the majority of the album's songs were conceived by Ware, I Want You was transformed into a biographical centerpiece for Gaye, who was then in a volatile marriage with Anna Gordy, sister to Berry Gordy, and also in a long-standing affair with Janis Hunter, who would later become the mother of his two youngest children. Gaye and Hunter were introduced to each other by producer Ed Townsend in 1973 at Hitsville West, while Townsend and Gaye were recording Let's Get It On. Hunter was 17 years old while Gaye was seventeen years her senior at the time Townsend introduced them. In his book Mercy, Mercy Me: The Art, Loves, and Demons of Marvin Gaye, the author and music writer Michael Eric Dyson elaborated on the relationship between I Want You and Gaye's affair with Hunter:\n\n\"I Want You is unmistakably a work of romantic and erotic tribute to the woman he deeply loved and would shortly marry, Janis Hunter. Gaye's obsession with the woman in her late teens is nearly palpable in the sensual textures that are the album's aural and lyrical signature. Their relationship was relentlessly passionate and emotionally rough-hewn; they played up each other's strengths, and played off each other's weaknesses.\"\nThough it was often hinted that Let's Get It On was the album Gaye had dedicated to her, Marvin has stated that this album was dedicated to Hunter, who is believed to have been in the studio when he recorded it. According to music critics, her presence may have increased the emotion in Ware's and Gaye's conception of I Want You. From Gaye's first recordings of I Want You to the album's release in 1976, Hunter and Gaye married and divorced in the span of three short years.

The marriage thrust her into the much more formal Habsburg court life, for which she was unprepared and which she found suffocating. Early in the marriage, she was at odds with her mother-in-law, who was also her maternal aunt, Archduchess Sophie, who took over the rearing of Elisabeth's daughters, one of whom, Sophie, died in infancy. The birth of a son, Crown Prince Rudolf, improved Elisabeth's standing at court, but her health suffered under the strain. As a result, she would often visit Hungary for its more relaxed environment. She came to develop a deep kinship with Hungary and helped to bring about the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867.\nThe death of Elisabeth's only son and his mistress Mary Vetsera in a murder\u2013suicide at his hunting lodge at Mayerling in 1889 was a blow from which the Empress never recovered. She withdrew from court duties and travelled widely, unaccompanied by her family. In 1890, she had the palace Achilleion built on the Greek island of Corfu. The palace featured an elaborate mythological motif and served as a refuge, which Elisabeth visited often. She was obsessively concerned with maintaining her youthful figure and beauty, developing a restrictive diet and wearing extremely tightlaced corsets to keep her waist looking very small.\nWhile travelling in Geneva in 1898, Elisabeth was fatally stabbed in the heart by an Italian anarchist named Luigi Lucheni. Her tenure of 44 years was the longest of any Austrian empress.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to the song, Carroll \"had borne 10 children\", though other accounts range from 8 to 11:\u200a1\u200a. She was president of a black social club.Already drunk before he got to the Emerson Hotel that night, the 6'2\" Zantzinger had assaulted employees at Eager House, a prestigious Baltimore restaurant, with the same cane. The cane was a 25-cent toy. At the Spinsters' Ball, he called a 30-year-old waitress a \"nigger\" and hit her with the cane; she fled the room in tears. Moments later, after ordering a bourbon that Carroll did not bring immediately, Zantzinger cursed her, called her a \"nigger\", then \"you black son of a bitch\", and struck her on the shoulder and across the head with the cane. In the words of the court notes: \"He asked for a drink and called her 'a black bitch', and 'black s.o.b'. She replied, 'Just a moment' and started to prepare his drink. After a delay of perhaps a minute, he complained about her being slow and struck her a hard blow on her shoulder about half-way between the point of her shoulder and her neck.\" She handed him his drink. After striking Carroll, he attacked his own wife, knocking her to the ground and hitting her with his shoe.Within five minutes from the time of the blow, Carroll leaned heavily against the barmaid next to her and complained of feeling ill. Carroll told co-workers, \"I feel deathly ill, that man has upset me so.\" The barmaid and another employee helped Carroll to the kitchen. Her arm became numb, her speech thick. She collapsed and was hospitalized. Carroll died eight hours after the assault. Her autopsy showed hardened arteries, an enlarged heart and high blood pressure. A spinal tap confirmed brain hemorrhage as the cause of death. She died in Mercy Hospital at 9 a.m. on February 9, 1963.\nZantzinger was initially charged with murder. His defense was that he had been extremely drunk, and he claimed to have no memory of the attack. His charge was reduced to manslaughter and assault, based on the likelihood that it was her stress reaction to his verbal and physical abuse that led to the intracranial bleeding, rather than blunt-force trauma from the blow that left no lasting mark. On August 28, Zantzinger was convicted of both charges and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. Time magazine covered the sentencing:In June, after Zantzinger's phalanx of five topflight attorneys won a change of venue to a court in Hagerstown, a three-judge panel reduced the murder charge to manslaughter. Following a three-day trial, Zantzinger was found guilty. For the assault on the hotel employees: a fine of $125. For the death of Hattie Carroll: six months in jail and a fine of $500. The judges considerately deferred the start of the jail sentence until September 15, to give Zantzinger time to harvest his tobacco crop.\nAfter the sentence was announced, the New York Herald Tribune conjectured he was given a sentence that short to keep him out of the largely black state prison, reasoning his notoriety would make him a target for abuse there. Zantzinger served his time in the comparative safety of the Washington County county jail, some 70 miles (110 km) from the scene of the crime.

Morrison wrote it in a stream of consciousness in the same vein as some of his earlier works, particularly those on Astral Weeks. The  song's narrative moves from France to San Francisco, Morrison's place of residence at the time, to Belfast, where he grew up, to New York City (\"52nd Street apartment\").\nSaint Dominic's Preview has been described as one of his most allusive, containing wide-ranging references including The Troubles, Morrison's pre-fame career cleaning windows, Notre-Dame cathedral and the vicissitudes of the recording industry.

Jim Gaines, employed at the Wally Heider Studios, was the engineer at the session. Pianist Tom Salisbury made the arrangements for the song, along with  \"I Will Be There\" and \"Redwood Tree\", which were also recorded at the final session. Salisbury had perfect pitch, which made it easy for him to write down the charts over the phone with instruction from Morrison.

Doug Messenger was no longer part of Morrison's band when the overdubs were being recorded, so numerous guitarists, including Ronnie Montrose, were brought in to play it. None produced the sound wanted, so Messenger was recalled, and managed to complete the overdub to Morrison's satisfaction in one take. Morrison also rerecorded his vocals, which, over the new backing, allowed him to react more to the music; \"no regrets\" was replaced with \"ne regrette rien\" and the vowel sound of \"wine\" was elongated to \"wi-ee-ine\".

Despite breaking the naming convention, Robert Fripp, King Crimson founder and only constant contributor to the suite, insists that \"Level Five\" is part of the pentalogy.\nIn 2011, PopMatters ranked the first part of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" as the eighth best progressive rock song ever.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_24301", "text": "\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\", the longest entry in the pentalogy, was first released as the introductory track to the album of the same name. The song is guided by the shifting guitar of Robert Fripp, but it is in the tense violin of David Cross and the chaotic percussion of Jamie Muir that Part I is defined.  The track goes through numerous varied acts and passages, with somber moments and a calm violin solo falling alongside periods of heightened aggression where Fripp's guitar borders on heavy metal and Muir's clangs reach cacophony. Bird calls, metallic clangs, horns, breaking crockery and tin ripping are all featured in Muir's repertoire, and, along with his percussive contributions, he coined the title \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\". In a 1991 interview, Muir said it was a \"very admirable creative decision\" for Fripp to work with him. Much of the track originated from full-band improvisations that began in 1971, with Cross calling it \"grown\" instead of written. Drummer Bill Bruford said the songs were \"hell\" to make given the deliberate lack of in-studio structure. An early version of Part I recorded by the 1971 lineup appeared as a bonus track on the 40th-anniversary edition of Islands under the name \"A Peacemaking Stint Unrolls\".\n\nWhile the first part is a many-sectioned, dynamic song that has been described as having a \"kitchen-sink sensibility\", \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\" is much more straightforward and riff-focused, with the sole writing credit going to Fripp. PopMatters called the track a \"roller-coaster of wrath and control\". The main riff of part II, which emerged in 1972 during a live performance at Richmond, Kentucky, is heavy and driving, drawing its host album to a dramatic climax. While the guitar in part II may be the most immediately obvious aspect, John Goldsby of Bass Player called the bass in the song something that \"bass players will still be talking about four decades later\". Fripp considered the first two parts of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" as the refinement of his role as composer in King Crimson.According to Fripp, Part I was conceived as the beginning of a King Crimson performance, and Part II as the end. \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\" was performed from 1972 to 1974, predominantly in a shortened seven-minute version that left out most of the violin solo and protracted ending passage. Part I was not performed again until 2014, when it was reintroduced as a setlist staple; it remained there through 2019. The new arrangement featured all of the violin segments played on guitar save for the solo, which was performed by Mel Collins on flute. Part II, alternatively, persisted in King Crimson's sets throughout most of their career.Both the first and second parts of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" have been met with critical acclaim. In 2011, Sean Murphy of PopMatters ranked the \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\" as the eighth best progressive rock song ever. He revised his placement in 2017, putting part I as number fifteen and \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\" as eighty-five.

The fifth part was ultimately released on 2003's The Power to Believe with the title \"Level Five\". Though nothing in the album's packaging confirmed that the song was part of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\", it shared elements of the series' rhythmic structure and form. While the relationship to the suite was hinted with an early 2001 tour jam combining a riff from part 1 of the suite with part of this piece, official confirmation only first appeared in the Elements 2017 box set, where it was included in sequence with the rest of the suite and called \"truly LTIA Pt V in all but name.\" The following year, Fripp confirmed that \"Level Five\" was indeed the fifth entry in the suite, but was renamed to \"unseat\" the expectations associated with the \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" title. It has since appeared on setlists and DGM Live downloads as \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part V\". The track is also listed on various streaming services as \"Level V\" with a Roman numeral, making it more consistent with the naming of the other parts.\n\"Level Five\" is a heavy guitar-driven track with glitchy and electronic drums that provide a rare, almost industrial groove. Several critics noted the sonic aggression of the song, and some compared the guitar interplay between Fripp and Belew as similar to the music on 1981's Discipline.

His childhood home was at 225 Triunvirato, later renumbered and renamed as 4943 Corrientes, opposite the theater Florencio S\u00e1nchez. Immersed since childhood in the theatrical environment and in the emerging world of radio, at fourteen he decided not to study further, a decision that earned him being thrown out of the house by his parents. He moved to El Centro area of Buenos Aires.\nLinking his fate to that of Carlos Gardel began in 1933 when he was presented as a performance artist speaker at the Nacional theater. In 1934, Nelson began broadcasting his Buenos Aires radio program \"Escuche esta Noche a Gardel\" (\"Listen tonight to Gardel\"), trying to keep alive the public's interest in Gardel, who was killed on June 24, 1935 in an accidental airplane crash in Medell\u00edn.  \nSoon after, on Radio Callao, opened in January of that year, the announcer Carlos Enrique Cecchetti began broadcasting a program fully devoted to Gardel. Nelson continued that program beginning in 1936, inaugurating the show \"El Bronce que Sonr\u00ede\" (\"The smiling bronze\"). This program moved in 1944 to Radio Mitre. Each daily program started with this saying: \"Through time and distance his name endures as the truest symbol of our arts. Carlos Gardel, the smiling bronze.\" Gardel's remains were returned from Colombia on 5 February 1936. Nelson broadcast a program from Gardel's gravesite in Chacarita Cemetery.\nAnother day radio program which gave Nelson great popularity was \"El Exito de Cada Orquesta\" (The Success of Every Orchestra), which was broadcast from Radio Callao (the station that also directed \"La Pandilla Coraz\u00f3n\") and then transferred to Radio Mitre and finally Radio Rivadavia. Knowing the value of ritual formulae, Nelson concluded each program with the same farewell: \"See you tomorrow, if God permits.\" Both programs remained stubbornly on the air long after radio stations had started to thin out their tango programming.\nIn 1936, he married Margarita Ibarrola Isaurralde when she was 17, but they separated in 1945, leaving his 7-year-old son, Julio Carlos (nicknamed \"Cachito\") with the boy's paternal grandparents. Margarita migrated to Brazil, where she married a German and had two children with him but again separated. Eventually all contact was lost. \nJulio then married Susana Carballo in 1951; she was a female tango singer known as Susana Ocampo. That marriage lasted only a year and half. They separated then, but no formal divorce. After Nelson's death, Susana became his heir.\nOne day, at age 14, Nelson's son escaped from the grandparents' house, leaving a letter in which he explained to them that he was going south. The truth was that he was going to Guayaquil, Ecuador with two friends. In Bolivia, they were arrested, but managed to continue traveling on a group passport. Nelson's son found employment at Club Barcelona. At that time, Tucho M\u00e9ndez, a friend of Julio Jorge and aware of the disappearance of Julio's child, recognized his son with great surprise. He immediately phoned Buenos Aires, and shortly after, via a link to a radio Guayaquil, Julio, asked the son to come back home. His son returned.\nJulio died on 6 March 1976, aged 62, four days after suffering a heart attack.\nJulio Jorge Nelson wrote several tangos that enjoyed success. By far, the most successful was \"Margarita Gauthier\" with music by the talented Joaqu\u00edn Mora. This tango was recorded by Alberto G\u00f3mez in 1935, but truly became famous due to the  version of Miguel Cal\u00f3 with Raul Beron, in 1942, which was followed by An\u00edbal Troilo with Fiorentino, in 1943.  \nNelson was also the author of the tangos \"Carriego\u201d, \u201c\u00d3yeme, mam\u00e1\u201d, \u201cQu\u00e9 ser\u00e1 de ti\u201d, \u201cNo debemos retornar\u201d, \u201cNocturno de tango\u201d, \u201cLa casa vac\u00eda\u201d, \u201cEscuchando tu voz\u201d, \u201cAl volverte a ver\u201d, \u201cJunto al piano\u201d, \u201cCuento azul\u201d, and \u201cDerrotao\u201d, among others. \nNelson also had two forays into film, \"Historia de un \u00cddolo\" and \"Soy del Tiempo de Gardel\", about a time which he more than anyone else celebrated.", "hasanswer": false}]}

If you ask me, when I listen to 'Hearts Once Nourished..' our first album, I think it's very rhythm based. It's very very melodic, but it's definitely more rhythm based. When you listen to 'That Within Blood Ill-Tempered', it's clearly more melody based... so a lot of my friends said: 'If you guys could combine the drive, the rock, and the aggression of \"Hearts\" and the structuring, the melody and the intelligence of \"That Within Blood Ill Tempered\", you might have my favorite album of all time.' So again, because I can never answer a question just directly, to answer your question directly, what we try to do is combine both albums. We wanted to make it smart, and heavy, we wanna make it sound great. We wanted to give something to people where they could groove along to it and rock for more than a second and a half without changing, but we also wanted to maintain some technical intelligent aspect, and the melodic nature of our last album. So if you take both those albums, throw them in a blender, I think you might have something that resembles 'Misanthrophy Pure'.\n\"It's faster, slower, more metal, less metal, more rock, more progressive, and less progressive than anything we've ever done.

Quasimodo was born with a hunchback and feared by the townspeople as a sort of monster, but he finds sanctuary in an unlikely love that is fulfilled only in death.\nThe role of Quasimodo has been played by many actors in film and stage adaptations, including Lon Chaney (1923), Charles Laughton (1939), Anthony Quinn (1956), and Anthony Hopkins (1982) as well as Tom Hulce in the 1996 Disney animated adaptation, Steve Lemme in the 2023 comedy \nQuasi, and most recently Angelo Del Vecchio in the Notre Dame de Paris revival.

He was born with a severe hunchback, a bushy eyebrow covering his left eye while the right eye \"disappeared entirely\" behind a giant wart. He was born to a tribe of Romani people (in the novel called \u00e9gyptienne or 'gypsies'), but due to his monstrous appearance he was switched during infancy with an able-bodied baby girl, Agnes. One character in the novel refers to him as animalistic and un-Christian, suggesting he may be the \"offspring of a Jew and a sow\", and thus deserving of death. After being discovered, Quasimodo is exorcised by Agnes's mother (who believed that the Romani people ate her child) and taken to Paris. He is found abandoned in Notre Dame (on the foundlings' bed, where orphans and unwanted children are left to public charity) on Quasimodo Sunday, the First Sunday after Easter, by Claude Frollo, the Archdeacon of Notre Dame, who adopts the baby, names him after the day the baby was found, and brings him up to be the bell-ringer of the cathedral. Due to the loud ringing of the bells, Quasimodo also becomes deaf causing Frollo to teach him sign language. Although he is hated for his deformity, it is revealed that he is kind at heart. Though Quasimodo commits acts of violence in the novel, these are only undertaken when he is instructed by others.\n\nLooked upon by the general populace of Paris as a monster, he believes that Frollo is the only one who cares for him, and frequently accompanies him when the Archdeacon walks out of Notre Dame. Frollo lusts after a beautiful Romani girl named Esmeralda, and enlists Quasimodo in trying to kidnap her. (She is later revealed to be Agnes, the baby Quasimodo was switched with.) Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00e2teaupers arrives to stop the kidnapping and captures Quasimodo, unaware that Quasimodo was merely following Frollo's orders. The deaf judge Florian Barbedienne sentences him to an hour of flogging and another hour of humiliation on the pillory. Phoebus ties Quasimodo up and has Pierre Torterue whip him in front of a jeering crowd. When Quasimodo calls to him for help, Frollo allows Quasimodo to be tortured as punishment for failing him.  When Quasimodo calls for water, a child throws a wet rag at him. Seeing his thirst, Esmeralda approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him and she captures his heart.\nEsmeralda is later entangled in an attempted murder \u2013 committed by Frollo, who had stabbed Phoebus in a jealous rage after spying on Esmeralda and Phoebus having a night of passion \u2013 and is sentenced to be hanged. As she is being forced to pray at the steps of Notre Dame just before being marched off to the gallows, Quasimodo, who has been watching the occasion from an upper balcony in Notre Dame, slides down with a rope, and rescues her by taking her up to the top of the cathedral, where he poignantly shouts \"Sanctuary!\" to the onlookers below.\nEsmeralda is terrified of Quasimodo at first, but gradually recognizes his kind heart and becomes his friend. He watches over her and protects her, and at one point saves her from Frollo when the mad priest sexually assaults her in her room. In one instance Esmeralda also sees Phoebus from the cathedral balcony and pleadingly convinces Quasimodo to go down and look for him, but Phoebus is repulsed by Quasimodo's appearance and refuses to visit Notre Dame to see her.\nAfter an uneasy respite, a mob of Paris's Truands led by Clopin Trouillefou storms Notre Dame, and although Quasimodo tries to fend them off by throwing stones and bricks down onto the mob and even pours deadly molten lead, the mob continues attacking until Phoebus and his soldiers arrive to fight and drive off the assailants. Unbeknownst to Quasimodo, Frollo lures Esmeralda outside, where he has her arrested and hanged. When Quasimodo sees Frollo smiling cruelly at Esmeralda's execution, he turns on his master and throws him to his death from the balcony in rage.\nQuasimodo cries in despair, lamenting \"There is all that I ever loved!\" He then leaves Notre Dame, never to return, and heads for the Gibbet of Montfaucon beyond the city walls, passing by the Convent of the Filles-Dieu, a home for 200 reformed prostitutes, and the leper colony of Saint-Lazare. After reaching the Gibbet, he lies next to Esmeralda's corpse, where it had been unceremoniously thrown after the execution. He stays at Montfaucon, and eventually dies of starvation, clutching the body of the deceased Esmeralda.

Rather than use one of their more melodic songs to experiment with the sound coming out of the PA system, they could use this song, which Nielsen called a \"perfect welcome to the show intro piece.\" Nielsen said he got the idea for such an intro song from an earlier band, Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera. \"Hello There\" replaced \"ELO Kiddies\" as Cheap Trick's live opening song. It was the band's typical live opener from 1977 through the mid-1980s. Music critic Bryan Wawzenek described it as \"the best concert opener in rock and roll.\"\"Hello There\" was covered by Foetus on their 1996 album Boil.  It was also covered by Phil Lewis in 2000. Cheap Trick's version was also included on the soundtrack to the Matt Dillon film Over the Edge, along with the Cheap Trick songs \"Surrender\", \"Downed\" and \"Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace.\" A version of \"Hello There\" that was recorded by the band in 1997 is also included in the music video game Rock Band 2 as a playable track.", "hasanswer": false}]}

AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote that the album has \"gone down as one of heavy metal's all-time greatest disappointments\" and described \"Zero the Hero\", \"Hot Line\", and \"Keep It Warm\" as \"embarrassing\". Blender contributor Ben Mitchell gave the album one out of five stars and claimed that the music on Born Again was worse than its cover. Martin Charles Strong, the author of The Essential Rock Discography, wrote that it was \"an exercise in heavy-metal clich\u00e9\". However, PopMatters contributor Adrien Begrand has noted the album as \"overlooked\". The British magazine Metal Forces defined it \"a very good album\" even if \"Gillan may not be the perfect frontman for the Sabs\".Despite the overall negative reception with critics, the album remains a fan favorite. Author Martin Popoff has written that \"if any album in the history of Black Sabbath is getting a new set of horns up from metalheads here deep into the new century, it's Born Again.\" Industrial metal band Godflesh and death metal band Cannibal Corpse both have covered \"Zero the Hero\", the former appears on the Masters Of Misery - Black Sabbath: The Earache Tribute album while the latter is featured on the Hammer Smashed Face EP. Cannibal Corpse's former singer, Chris Barnes, has called Born Again his favourite Black Sabbath album. \"Zero the Hero\" has also been cited as the inspiration for the Guns N' Roses hit \"Paradise City\", and in his autobiography Iommi also suggests the Beastie Boys may have borrowed the riff from \"Hot Line\" for their hit \"(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party!)\".  Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich has called Born Again \"one of the best Black Sabbath albums\". Bill Stevenson, former drummer of Black Flag, stated the band was listening to the album around the time of My War, defining songs like \"Trashed\" and \"Disturbing the Priest\" as \"ideal\".In 1984, Ozzy Osbourne stated that the album was the \"best thing I've heard from Sabbath since the original group broke up\". Butler has pointed to \"Zero the Hero\" and \"Disturbing the Priest\" as his favorites on the album. Butler has said that while he initially felt that the poor production had spoiled Born Again, upon re-listening to it decades later \"it was a lot better than I remembered\", saying \"If the songs are good enough, you can get away with iffy production.\" He points to Iommi's riffs and says \"Ian's singing is great\". In 1992, Iommi confessed to Guitar World, \"To be honest, I didn't like some of the songs on that album, and the production was awful. We never had time to test the pressings after it was recorded, and something happened to it by the time it got released.\"\nIan Gillan expressed disappointment in the final production mix of the album, saying that although he did not break his first copy of it, \"I threw it out the window of my car.

By 1980, Greg Harris and Ed Ponder had left the group, leaving the Burritos as a trio of \"Sneaky\" Pete Kleinow, Gib Guilbeau and Skip Battin. In addition to commitments with the Flying Burrito Brothers, Guilbeau was also working as a songwriter for Criterion Music with John Beland, who Guilbeau knew from his time in the band Swampwater. Guilbeau and Beland wrote some songs and ultimately, Beland was invited to join the Burritos. Beland was reluctant to join the now nearly defunct band, as he was riding strong as lead guitarist with Ricky Nelson who (with Beland's help) was enjoying his own comeback of sorts.\nHowever, after leaving Nelson in the hopes of producing the Burritos, Beland took the Burritos in a more commercial direction, having already written a number of country hits for other artists prior to his joining the FBB. In addition, the band's name at this time was shortened to simply The Burrito Brothers, a suggestion made by Curb Records.\nBeland's song demos, which featured the Burritos on them, eventually made it to Dick Whitehouse at Curb records, who signed the band to a deal with Curb / Epic Records. By December 1980, the band's first single for Curb, \"She's a Friend of a Friend\" reached the US country top 70. Hearts on the Line followed in January 1981 and spawned two further singles, both of which made the US country top 20, \"Does She Wish She Was Single Again?\" and \"She Belongs to Everyone But Me\". More would follow.\nThat year, The Burrito Brothers received the number one \"Crossover from pop to country\" award from Billboard Magazine as well as best new vocal group award from Record World Magazine.

Ghost Dog arrives and kills the gangster, before seeing that the girl is also in the room; he leaves her alive. To avoid being implicated in the murder of a made man, Vargo and his associate Sonny Valerio decide to get rid of Ghost Dog. Louie knows practically nothing about Ghost Dog, as the hitman communicates only by homing pigeon. The mobsters start by tracing all the pigeon coops in town. They find Ghost Dog's cabin atop a building and kill his pigeons. Ghost Dog realizes he must kill Vargo and his men or they will kill him and his master.\nDuring the day, Ghost Dog frequently visits the park to see his best friend, a French-speaking ice cream man named Raymond. Ghost Dog does not understand French and Raymond does not understand English but the two nonetheless seem to connect with each other. Ghost Dog also befriends a little girl named Pearline, to whom he lends the book Rash\u014dmon.\nEventually, Ghost Dog invades Vargo's mansion and kills almost everyone single-handedly, sparing only Louie and Vargo's daughter.

He said: 'Play that again.' I played it again, and he goes: 'Wait here.' He brought in everybody in the building who was working there and said 'Play it.'

Prior to the release of Warnes's version of \"Right Time\", Bette Midler expressed an interest in recording the song but asked that the bridge be reworked, a stipulation McCann was still working on when Warnes's version reached the charts, at which point work on a Midler version was dropped.\n\"Right Time of the Night\" was one of seven songs which McCann played for Clive Davis, president of Arista Records (for whom Jennifer Warnes recorded) when McCann was making the rounds of auditions in hopes of being signed as a recording artist. McCann would recall Davis saying: \"I don't like you as an artist, but I'm taking six of the seven songs.\" \"Right Time\" was one of the six songs Davis optioned (the one song Davis passed on was \"Do You Wanna Make Love\" which would afford McCann a top ten hit when he recorded it after his October 1976 signing with 20th Century Records).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23580", "text": "\"Jumpin' Right In\" is a song recorded by Canadian country music artist Jim Witter.
