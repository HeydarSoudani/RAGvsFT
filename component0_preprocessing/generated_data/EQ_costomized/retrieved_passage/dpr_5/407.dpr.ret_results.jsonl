XXI:1). The work is the first oratorio the composer wrote and, according to Jones, was \"his most extended and ambitious composition up to that time\".The Italian-language libretto of the work is by Giovanni Gastone Boccherini, brother of the composer Luigi Boccherini. This libretto is harshly criticized by Olleson, who notes that the author de-dramatizes vivid episodes in the source (the story of Tobit in the Apocrypha), depriving Haydn of the opportunity for highly dramatic musical utterance.The work was premiered in Vienna on 2 April 1775, under the sponsorship of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, a musician's benevolent society. The musical forces were substantial: Smither writes: \"characteristic of the large forces used for the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t concerts, the orchestra, chorus, and soloists possibly numbered more than 180 performers.\" He adds that the premiere was \"enormously successful.\"In 1784, Haydn substantially revised the work, with cuts to make numbers shorter and new choruses, for another of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t's benefit concerts. It is thought that at this concert Haydn first met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who became his good friend. One of the soprano soloists was Nancy Storace, also a friend of Haydn, who later was Mozart's first Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro.In 1808 the oratorio made a third appearance on the program of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, this time in a revised version by the now-elderly composer's pupil, Sigismund Neukomm. The performance on the night of 22 December, which required the labors of most of the highly qualified musicians in Vienna, had regrettable consequences for a now-famous rival concert taking place in Vienna on the same evening, the benefit for Ludwig van Beethoven that premiered his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies.\nToday, Il ritorno di Tobia is eclipsed by Haydn's later works in this genre \u2013 The Creation and The Seasons \u2013 and is seldom performed or recorded.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_5340", "text": "Soloists:\n\nTobia (tenor)\nAnna, Tobia's mother (alto)\nTobit, Tobia's father (bass)\nSara, Tobia's wife (soprano)\nRaffaele, an angel (soprano)Hebrew choir (SATB) and orchestra\nThe venue of the event is the Tobias parents' house in Nineveh.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_42626", "text": "Toto in Madrid (Italian: Tot\u00f2, Eva e il pennello proibito) is an Italian comedy film from 1959, directed by Steno, written by Vittorio Metz, starring Tot\u00f2 and Louis de Fun\u00e8s.

To cope with her loneliness, Am\u00e9lie develops an active imagination and a mischievous personality. When Am\u00e9lie is six, her mother, Amandine, is killed when a suicidal Canadian tourist jumps from the roof of Notre-Dame de Paris and lands on her. As a result, her father, Rapha\u00ebl, withdraws more and more from society. Am\u00e9lie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins in Montmartre, which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. She is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks, cracking cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a spoon, and skipping stones along the Canal Saint-Martin.On 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, Am\u00e9lie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box which contains childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Am\u00e9lie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others.\nAfter asking the apartment's concierge and several old tenants about the boy's identity, Am\u00e9lie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with brittle bone disease who replicates Pierre-Auguste Renoir's 1881 painting Luncheon of the Boating Party every year. He recalls the boy's name as \"Bretodeau\". Am\u00e9lie finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau, and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Am\u00e9lie happily embarks on her new mission.\nAm\u00e9lie secretly executes complex schemes that positively affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the M\u00e9tro station while giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his garden gnome and having a flight attendant friend mail pictures of it posing with landmarks from all over the world. She starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker Georgette and Joseph, a patron of the cafe. She convinces Madeleine Wallace, the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She plays practical jokes on Collignon, the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek, good-natured assistant Lucien. A delighted Lucien subsequently takes charge at the grocery stand.\nDufayel, having observed Am\u00e9lie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same Renoir painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, Am\u00e9lie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Am\u00e9lie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Am\u00e9lie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Am\u00e9lie retrieves it.\nAm\u00e9lie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Am\u00e9lie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina, concerned for Am\u00e9lie's well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph's comment about this misleads Am\u00e9lie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayel's insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship.

A survey conducted in the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) found Misirkov to be \"the most significant Macedonian of the 20th century\". For his efforts to codify a standard Macedonian language, he is often considered \"the founder of the modern Macedonian literary language\".On the other hand, he was one of the founders of the pro-Bulgarian Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Circle established in 1900 in St. Petersburg. In 1905 he began publishing predominantly articles, written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective in the IMARO-affiliated press. In his diary written during the Balkan Wars, he espoused pro-Bulgarian views. During the First World War, he became a member of the local parliament in Bessarabia as a representative of the Bulgarian minority there. During the 1920s he encouraged the Macedonian Slavs to adopt a Bulgarian national identity. Misirkov returned to Macedonian nationalism for a period in 1914 and again in 1924 and 1925. Misirkov died in 1926 and was buried in the Sofia Central Cemetery with the financial support from the Ministry of Education, as an honoured Bulgarian educator.\nBecause Misirkov expressed conflicting views about the national identity of the Macedonian Slavs at different points in his life, his national affiliation and legacy remain a matter of dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia. While Misirkov's work and personality remain highly controversial and disputed, there have been attempts among international scholars to reconcile the conflicting and self-contradictory statements made by Misirkov. According to historian Ivo Banac, Misirkov viewed both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians, and espoused pan-Bulgarian patriotism in a larger Balkan context. However, in the context of the larger Bulgarian unit/nation, Misirkov sought both cultural and national differentiation from the other Bulgarians and called both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia, Macedonians.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Rosario was in fact declared the capital three times by Congress, only to face presidential vetoes each time.\nAt the time of its foundation, La Capital was an afternoon newspaper. Newspapers were just forums of political debate with classified ads. Since the beginning, the heading of La Capital included a motto showing a commitment to public opinion: Las columnas de La Capital pertenecen al pueblo, \"La Capital's columns belong to the people\".\nOn 19 August 1868 the editorial building was at 104 Santa Fe St. After that, La Capital turned into a morning newspaper, and in 1870 it moved to Port St. (now Buenos Aires St.).

By 1905 the daily edition had 16 pages, and in 1906 it offered a full-color 28-page illustrated supplement.\nFor 111 years, since its foundation, the newspaper employed the \"hot type\" method, that is, with Linotype typesetting machines where molten lead and antimony were used to cast each line of text. In 1978 La Capital shifted to \"cold type\", using the phototypesetting method.\nIn mid-1998 the new publishing plant at Santiago St. near Rivadavia Ave. received its latest innovation, a Goss Urbanite rotating press which weighs 165 tonnes and measures almost 36 m in length.

The song is also associated with the region, having been used by the supporters of Robert Shafto (sometimes spelt Shaftoe), who was an eighteenth-century British Member of Parliament (MP) for County Durham (c. 1730\u201397), and later the borough of Downton in Wiltshire. Supporters used another verse in the 1761 election:\n\nBobby Shafto's looking out,\nAll his ribbons flew about,\nAll the ladies gave a shout,\nHey for Bobby Shafto!The song is said to relate the story of how he broke the heart of Bridget Belasyse of Brancepeth Castle, County Durham, where his brother Thomas was rector, when he married Anne Duncombe of Duncombe Park in Yorkshire. Bridget Belasyse is said to have died two weeks after hearing the news.Thomas & George Allan, in their illustrated edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings (1891), argued that the \"Bobby Shafto\" of the song was in fact his son, although his father fits the description of the lyrics better.

In 1923 Aftenposten adopted the Norwegian spelling standard of 1907, which mainly replaced the \"soft\" consonants (e.g. d, b) characteristic of Danish pronunciation (but also used in some Norwegian dialects) with \"hard\" consonants (e.g. t, p) characteristic of Eastern Central Norwegian pronunciation, but which was otherwise mostly identical with Danish.  In 1928 Aftenposten adopted the most conservative variant of the spelling standard of 1917, which is largely similar to the \"moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" or \"Riksm\u00e5l\" standard used today.\nDuring the Norwegian language struggle from the early 1950s, Aftenposten was the main newspaper of the Riksm\u00e5l variety of Norwegian, and maintained close ties to the Riksm\u00e5l movement's institutions, recognising the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature as the sole authoritative body for regulating the Norwegian language as used by the newspaper. Due to its status as the country's largest and most influential newspaper, Aftenposten therefore had a significant influence on the developments that took place during the Norwegian language struggle. The \"moderate\" or \"conservative\" Riksm\u00e5l language used by Aftenposten was mainly associated with a conservative stance in Norwegian politics, and was contrasted with the \"radical\" Samnorsk language, an attempt to merge Bokm\u00e5l with Nynorsk which was promoted by socialist governments in the 1950s. By 1960 it had become apparent that the Samnorsk attempt had failed, and as a result, Aftenposten's Riksm\u00e5l standard and the government-promoted Bokm\u00e5l standard have in the following decades become almost identical as the Bokm\u00e5l standard has incorporated nearly all of Riksm\u00e5l. As a consequence, Aftenposten decided to describe its language as \"Moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" from 2006, and published its own dictionary, based on Riksm\u00e5l and Moderate Bokm\u00e5l, but excluding \"radical\" (i.e. similar to Nynorsk) variants of Bokm\u00e5l.\nThe online version of the paper for some years during the early 2000s had an English section.

It was composed in 1942 on Britten's sea voyage from the United States to England.\nBritten composed the music at the same time as the Hymn to St. Cecilia and in similar style.

A harp solo based on the chant, along with a few other motifs from \"Wolcum Yole\", also serves to unify the composition.

It is preserved in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a historical record of events in Anglo-Saxon England which was kept from the late ninth to the mid-twelfth century. The poem records the Battle of Brunanburh, a battle fought in 937 between an English army and a combined army of Scots, Vikings, and Britons. The battle resulted in an English victory, celebrated by the poem in style and language like that of traditional Old English battle poetry. The poem is notable because of those traditional elements and has been praised for its authentic tone, but it is also remarkable for its fiercely nationalistic tone, which documents the development of a unified England ruled by the House of Wessex.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_5742", "text": "\"The Battle of Brunanburh\" is edited, annotated and linked to digital images of all five of its manuscript witnesses, with modern translation, in the Old English Poetry in Facsimile Project: https://oepoetryfacsimile.org/\nThe poem is included in the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records. The now-accepted standard edition of the poem is the 1938 edition by Alistair Campbell. The Battle of Brunanburh: A Casebook, edited by Michael Livingston, was published by the University of Exeter Press in 2011; it includes two alternative translations of the poem and essays on the battle and the poem.The twelfth-century Anglo-Norman chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar likely used the account in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for his treatment of \u00c6thelstan in his L'Estoire des Engles. English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson translated (or \"modernized\") the poem in 1880, publishing it as part of his Ballads and Other Poems (and his son Hallam Tennyson published a prose translation of the poem). In contrast to many other translations of poetry, Tennyson's is still praised as \"a faithful, sensitive, even eloquent recreation of its source.\" The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short poem, \"Brunanburh 937 AD,\" a translation of which was published in The New Yorker. In a 1968 lecture at Harvard University, Borges praised Tennyson's translation, stating that in some locutions Tennyson sounds \"more Saxon than the original.\" A translation by Burton Raffel is included in Alexandra Hennessey Olsen's anthology Poems and prose from the Old English.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_5741", "text": "The style of the poem has been described as \"sagalike in its sparse use of language combined with ample specific detail.\" According to George Anderson, since the poem comes so late in the Old English period, it gives evidence of the continuing attraction of the \"warrior tradition\": it is \"clear and convincing testimony to the vitality of the Old English battle-epic tradition; the authentic ring sounds out years after the Beowulf Poet, Caedmon, and Cynewulf have been laid to rest.\" Donald Fry compares passages from Beowulf and Brunanburh (concerning the boarding of ships) and remarks on the \"similar diction and imagery\". According to Malcolm Godden, the language resembles that of the Old English Genesis A. The poem is not without its detractors: an early critic, Walter J. Sedgefield, in a 1904 study of the poems in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, said \"even the longest and best written of their number, the Battle of Brunanburh, is but a simulacrum, a ghost of the older epos\". That the poem should not be treated as a historical text, and that panegyric was the appropriate genre, was argued by Alistair Campbell: \"The poet's subjects are the praise of heroes and the glory of victory. When this is realised, the oft-repeated criticism, that he does not greatly add to our knowledge of the battle, falls to the ground. It was not his object to do so. He was not writing an epic or a 'ballad.' He was writing a panegyric.\" Townend agrees, and notes that praise-poems on contemporary men are completely missing from the Anglo-Saxon period until a cluster of four panegyrics including Brunanburh in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.Compared to \"The Battle of Maldon\", an Old English poem that commemorates a battle between English and Vikings half a century later, Brunanburh is notable for its nationalist overtones, whereas Maldon celebrates Christian over non-Christian values. Indeed, the poem is seen as celebrating a logical progression in the development of England as a unified nation ruled by the House of Wessex; the battle reports \"the dawning of a sense of nationality, ....a crisis in which a nation is involved\". In this respect, Brunanburh is closer to the Anglo-Saxon poem The Taking of the Five Boroughs, also found in the Chronicle under the year 942, celebrating King Edmund's recapture of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. But while the poet claims veracity, Michael Swanton notes, \"it is ironic in view of his primarily historic concerns that he is in fact more successful than the Maldon-poet in transmitting the traditional poetic style.\" Peter Clemoes argues in Interactions of Thought and Language in Old English Poetry that Brunanburh, as opposed to Maldon, relies on \"uncomplicated patriotic triumphalism\". The poem does not treat \"personal responsibility\" as Maldon does, but leans on an expansive view of history which sees the battle, in line with the Chronicle's view of contemporary history as the \"epitome of Anglo-Saxon, especially West Saxon, history with antecedents in the history of Britain\", as \"straightforwardly traditional\". According to Patrick Wormald, the poem builds on the \"sense of ideological identity that the English had been given by Bede.\"\nThis poet from the 10th century is recalling the Germanic conquest of England which occurred in the 5th century; he connects his memory of this present victory, which must have been very moving for the Saxons \u2014 for it was more common for the Norse to defeat them, and rare for them to be the victors \u2014 he linked it to the often secular victories enjoyed by the first Germanic peoples who arrived in England.\nAccompanying the combatants are the usual \"beasts of battle\" found in other Old English poems\u2014the wolf, the raven, and the eagle. The Battle of Brunanburh, however, seems to include a fourth animal, the gu\u00fehafoc (literally Goshawk), or \"war-hawk,\" in line 64. However, editors and scholars of the poem have suggested that graedigne gu\u00fehafoc, \"greedy war-hawk\", is actually a kenning for the hasu-padan, / earn \u00e6ftan hwit, the \"dusky coated, white-tailed eagle\" of lines 62b-63a.Simon Walker suggests that was written at Worcester, under the influence of its bishop, Koenwald, and that the emphasis on Edmund's contribution suggests that it was written during his reign.

Sundanese Standard Sundanese There are two types of Sundanese used. First, the Priangan Sundanese or new phase Sundanese, which is used by the people in the Gantar sub-district and parts of Haurgeulis (bordering the Subang district), the southern Terisi District (which borders Majalengka and Sumedang Regencies), and the Karangjaya block in Mangunjaya village in Anjatan District. Sundanese Indramayu - there is also the original Sundanese Indramayu phase in the Indramayu Regency, namely in Ilir, Bulak, and Parean Girang villages in Kandanghaur District, and Lelea and Tamansari villages in Lelea District. The Sundanese phase of Old Sundanese is somewhat different from the new Sundanese phase due to temporal dialect differences. The most obvious difference is that in the ancient Sundanese language, there were no undak-usuk (levels of language). Old Sundanese also did not recognize the vowel /eu/, but only /e/. Not to mention the difference in vocabulary. Javanese There are currently three dialects of Javanese in Indramayu Regency. The majority are Dermayu dialects (Indramayu).

The Tegal-Brebes dialect of Javanese language also exists in the western region of Indramayu Regency because in the 1920s there was migration from Tegal-Brebes to the region, namely in several villages or blocks in the Haurgeulis, Anjatan, Patrol, Sukra, and Bongas Districts. The Javanese language dialect Dermayu is mostly used by the people of Indramayu, who total about 1.894 million people in 2023.

Dredd and his rookie partner, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey high-rise block of apartments and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).\nGarland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new Judge Dredd film adaptation, unrelated to the 1995 film Judge Dredd, was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio DNA Films, Dredd began principal photography, using 3D cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on practical sets and locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg.\nDredd was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action sequences, while criticism focused on excessive violence as well as a perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30\u201345 million.

In August 2012, Garland said that a Judge Dredd television series would be a positive future step for the series. In September 2012, Garland said that he would explore the \"Origins\" and \"Democracy\" storylines, would introduce characters Judge Cal and Chopper, and would pursue the concept that Judge Dredd is a fascist. That same month, Macdonald said that further films would be made in partnership with IM Global and would likely be shot in South Africa.In March 2013, executive producer Adi Shankar said that a sequel was unlikely. In May 2013, Urban said that a sequel was still possible, noting that the film had found an audience, and the response of fans could resurrect the project.

In an interview in May 2016, Urban said that while the film's \"mishandled\" marketing strategy and \"unfortunate\" box office performance meant that it was \"problematic\" to try to make a sequel, \"the success it has achieved in all post-theatrical mediums has definitely strengthened the argument in favour of a sequel.\" In May 2017, a television series named Judge Dredd: Mega-City One was announced to be in development by IM Global Television and Rebellion.

It is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and was released in October 2013 for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS in PAL regions by Nintendo and by Sega in North America and Japan. A port of the Wii U version for Windows was later released in November 2015.\nLost World focuses on the efforts of Sonic the Hedgehog to stop the Deadly Six, an alien tribe that serves as the game's main antagonists, as they seek to siphon the world's energy from the Lost Hex, the game's setting. Sonic and his long-time sidekick Tails must team up with Doctor Eggman, normally their enemy, to stop the Deadly Six, leading to conflicts among the three parties. While the gameplay is typical of the Sonic series in some ways, it adds parkour mechanics and features largely cylindrical level design with an emphasis on alternate pathways. The game also features the Wisp creatures from Sonic Colors as power-ups.\nThe game began development shortly after the 2010 release of Sonic Colors. It was designed to be streamlined and fluid in movement and design, using tube-like level design and a simple, bright color scheme. The game received mixed reviews upon release; its controls and the Deadly Six were frequently criticized, but its visuals and audio were seen positively. Downloadable content was released both alongside and after the game's release, adding features such as additional levels and a new type of Wisp power.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_5840", "text": "Development for Sonic Lost World started shortly after Sonic Colors was finished, when a few core members started the experimentation for the former and took place over two-and-a-half years. Sonic Team sought to streamline the controls, increase the length, and add more diverse levels compared to previous entries in the series. After reviewing the history of the franchise with Sonic Generations, game producer Takashi Iizuka hoped to \"deliver a new experience\" with Sonic Lost World. Development started on PC, with early experiments involving \"twisted tube-type level[s]\" inspired by Jack and the Beanstalk. As the concept \"was totally new\", early levels had to be remade \"over and over.\" Players were given greater ability to control Sonic's speed in an effort to create a more traditional platforming experience. The parkour mechanic was introduced to maintain a more fluid sense of movement, in contrast to previous Sonic games where running into a wall would force the player to a complete stop. Iizuka stated that \"This game is like going into the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland, an action game where you can experience many strange and fun experiences.\"Development ultimately focused on the Wii U and 3DS because of the success of previous Sonic games on Nintendo platforms. Because Wii U \"has two monitors to use\", Sonic Team decided to include both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The Wii U GamePad's touch screen and gyroscope were employed to activate the returning Color Powers. The 3DS version, co-developed with Dimps, was designed to \"fully utilize\" the 3DS hardware with 3D gameplay and motion controls. Development was harder on 3DS due to its more limited processing power. Iizuka stated that the Color Powers are \"essential\" to the level design of the 3DS version, while they work as an \"additional tool\" in the Wii U version. A simple art style was used to make objects stand out more against the backgrounds, and to keep the game running at a consistent 60 frames per second. The design of the new \"Deadly Six\" villains was based on that of an ogre, and each one's appearance was intended to reflect a certain key characteristic of their personality, which the developers hoped players could see \"just by looking at them.\" The Wii U version of the game was directed by Morio Kishimoto, the director of Sonic Colors and the lead designer of Sonic and the Black Knight, while the 3DS version was directed by Takao Hirabayashi, the director of Sonic Colors DS, and previously lead designer of Sonic Unleashed PS2/Wii.Sega trademarked the title Sonic Lost World in May 2013. The game was revealed on May 17, 2013, in a Nintendo Direct announcement, as part of an exclusive partnership between Sega and Nintendo for the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It is one of three games in this partnership, the other ones being the fourth entry to the Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series, and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal, a game based on the Sonic Boom animated series. Sega reported that more on the game would be revealed before E3 2013, and that the game would contain both returning and new original characters, both in enemies and friends of Sonic. The first trailer for the game was released on May 28, a day earlier than previously announced. A downloadable demo of the game's first stage was made available for both consoles on October 9 in Japan and in mid-November in North America and Europe. To promote the release of Sonic Lost World, Hardlight released an update for Sonic Dash that includes a boss battle against Zazz, one of the Deadly Six. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U also includes a stage based on Windy Hill Zone from the game.\nThe soundtrack was composed and directed by Tomoya Ohtani, with Takahito Eguchi handling the orchestration and cutscene music. Naofumi Hataya also contributed a single piece, the theme for \"Desert Ruins Zone - Act 3\". A three-disc soundtrack, Sonic Lost World Original Soundtrack Without Boundaries, was released physically in Japan and digitally worldwide via iTunes and Amazon Music on November 27, 2013.A special, limited stock \"Deadly Six\" edition of the Wii U version of the game was available for pre-order, which included special \"Nightmare\" downloadable content (DLC), featuring a new stage and boss battles based on one of Sonic Team's previous games, Nights into Dreams. Clearing the DLC unlocks a special Color Power, the Black Bomb, normally only obtainable via Miiverse. Pre-ordering the game from Amazon.com allowed the player to start off with twenty-five extra lives.A patch for the Wii U version was released on December 10, 2013, adding additional features such as button controls for some Wisps and the traditional extra life reward for collecting 100 rings. On December 18, 2013, Nintendo announced two exclusive pieces of free DLC for the Wii U version based on other Nintendo games. The first DLC stage, \"Yoshi's Island Zone\", was released on the day of the announcement, with a second installment, \"The Legend of Zelda Zone\", released on March 27, 2014.

Levels range from side-scrolling 2D levels to fast-moving 3D linear levels to levels taking place on spherical worlds similar to the canceled Sonic X-treme and the Super Mario Galaxy series. This also translates to the 3DS version, as it was the first handheld game in the series presented entirely in 3D.\nThe game uses a new control system which allows players to control Sonic's speed. Simply moving the directional controls will move Sonic at a moderate pace, allowing for more precision. Holding down a trigger button will cause Sonic to sprint, allowing him to move faster and perform new parkour moves, such as running up and along walls and hopping over small ledges. In the air, Sonic can perform a double jump, which returns from Sonic Colors, a homing attack, which can now target multiple enemies in quick succession, and a new kick attack, which can be used to defeat stronger enemies, or knock them into others.\nAlso returning from Colors are the Wisp creatures, which provide short-lived power-ups to Sonic. The Wisps' powers are now controlled using the Wii U GamePad's touchscreen and gyroscopic features. Alongside returning powers such as Drill, Laser and Rocket, new powers include Eagle, which lets Sonic fly through the air, Asteroid, which atomizes objects in his path, and Rhythm, which lets him bounce along a path of notes. There are also some Wisps exclusive to each version of the game. During the game, players can rescue animals by destroying enemies or opening containers, allowing players to progress, or find Red Star Rings that open up circus-themed bonus stages where players can earn more animals. Collecting all the Red Star Rings in the game unlocks the ability to transform into Super Sonic.The Wii U version supports both co-operative multiplayer, in which a second player can control a remote controlled vehicle to assist Sonic, and competitive multiplayer, in which a second player can use the Wii U Gamepad screen to race against the other player. The game also supports Off-TV Play functionality and formerly Miiverse. Using Miiverse, players could exchange items such as Wisps or shields, which would grow more effective if they were used by other players. The 3DS version supports both local and online multiplayer for up to four players.

According to Hong Kong film director, producer, and movie writer Ronny Yu, wuxia movies are not to be confused with martial arts movies.The word \"w\u01d4xi\u00e1\" is a compound composed of the elements w\u01d4 (\u6b66, literally \"martial\", \"military\", or \"armed\") and xi\u00e1 (\u4fe0, literally \"chivalrous\", \"vigilante\" or \"hero\").

They often originate from the lower social classes of ancient Chinese society.

Themes of romance are also strongly featured in some wuxia tales.\nA typical wuxia story features a young male protagonist who experiences a tragedy \u2013 such as the loss of his loved ones \u2013 and goes on to undertake several trials and tribulations to learn several forms of martial arts from various fighters. At the end of the story, he emerges as a powerful fighter whom few can equal. He uses his abilities to follow the code of xia and mends the ills of the jianghu. For instance, the opening chapters of some of Jin Yong's works follow a certain pattern: a tragic event occurs, usually one that costs the lives of the newly introduced characters, and then it sets events into motion that will culminate in the primary action of the story.Other stories use different structures. For instance, the protagonist is denied admission into a martial arts school. He experiences hardships and trains secretly and waits until there is an opportunity for him to show off his skills and surprise those who initially looked down on him. Some stories feature a mature hero with powerful martial arts abilities confronting an equally powerful antagonist as his nemesis. The plot will gradually meander to a final dramatic showdown between the protagonist and his nemesis. These types of stories were prevalent during the era of anti-Qing revolutionaries.Certain stories have unique plots, such as those by Gu Long and Huang Yi. Gu Long's works have an element of mystery and are written like detective stories. The protagonist, usually a formidable martial artist and intelligent problem-solver, embarks on a quest to solve a mystery such as a murder case. Huang Yi's stories are blended with science fiction.\nDespite these genre-blending elements, wuxia is primarily a historical genre of fiction. Notwithstanding this, wuxia writers openly admit that they are unable to capture the entire history of a course of events and instead choose to structure their stories along the pattern of the protagonist's progression from childhood to adulthood instead. The progression may be symbolic rather than literal, as observed in Jin Yong's The Smiling, Proud Wanderer, where Linghu Chong progresses from childish concerns and dalliances into much more adult ones as his unwavering loyalty repeatedly thrusts him into the rocks of betrayal at the hands of his inhumane master.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26356", "text": "The novel is composed in written vernacular (baihua) rather than Classical Chinese (wenyan).

The Legend of Sword and Fairy, in particular, expanded into a franchise of eight video games, two of which were adapted into the television series Chinese Paladin (2005) and Chinese Paladin 3 (2009). There are also MMORPGs, such as JX Online 3, Heroes of Kung Fu and Age of Wulin, and hack and slash games, such as Bujingai and Heavenly Sword.Games adapted from the works of wuxia writers include Heroes of Jin Yong, an RPG based on characters in Jin Yong's novels; Dragon Oath, an MMORPG inspired by Jin Yong's Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils; and Martial Kingdoms, a strategy game featuring several martial arts schools which commonly appear in wuxia fiction.\nThe wuxia genre continues to be drawn as a pool of inspiration or source material for Chinese video game studios. In June 2022, Tencent's Lightspeed Studio released a demo trailer on Code: To Jin Yong. In the following month, Everstone Studio unveiled Where Winds Meet, a game compared to Ghost of Tsushima and Assassin's Creed. 2023 saw the release of \"Hero's Adventure: Road to Passion\" in November, a wuxia-inspired open world RPG.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This is because Prakrit, in its multiple variants, had been favoured since the time of the influential Edicts of Ashoka (circa 250 BCE).Besides a few examples from the 1st century BCE, most of the early Sanskrit inscriptions date to the time of the Indo-Scythian rulers, either the Northern Satraps around Mathura for the earliest ones, or, slightly later, the closely related Western Satraps in western and central India. It is thought that they became promoters of Sanskrit as a way to show their attachment to Indian culture: according to Salomon \"their motivation in promoting Sanskrit was presumably a desire to establish themselves as legitimate Indian or at least Indianized rulers and to curry the favor of the educated Brahmanical elite\".\nIn western India, the first known inscription in Sanskrit appears to have been made by Ushavadata, son-in-law of the Western Satrap ruler Nahapana, at the front of Cave no.10 in the Nasik Caves. The inscription dates to the early 2nd century CE, and has hybrid features.\n\nThe Junagadh rock inscription of Western Satraps ruler Rudradaman I (c. 150 AD, Gujarat) is the first long inscription in fairly standard Sanskrit that has survived into the modern era. It represents a turning point in Sanskrit epigraphy, states Salomon, being \"the first extensive record in the poetic style\" in \"more or less standard Sanskrit\". The Rudradaman inscription is \"not pure classical Sanskrit\", but with few epic-vernacular Sanskrit exceptions, it approaches high classical Sanskrit. It is important because it is likely the prototype of the extensive Sanskrit inscriptions of the Gupta Empire era. These inscriptions are also in the Br\u0101hm\u012b script.\nDuring the reign of Rudradaman, circa 150 CE, it is also known that the Greek writer Yavanesvara translated the Yavanajataka from Greek to Sanskrit, for \"the use of those who could not speak Greek\", a translation which became an authority for all later astrology works in India.The spread of the usage of Sanskrit inscriptions to the south can also probably be attributed to the influence of the Western Satraps, who were in close relation with southern Indian rulers: according to Salomon \"a Nagarjunakonda memorial pillar inscription of the time of King Rudrapurusadatta attests to a marital alliance between the Western Ksatrapas and the Iksvaku rulers of Nagarjunakonda\". The Nagarjunakonda inscriptions are the earliest substantial South Indian Sanskrit inscriptions, probably from the late 3rd-century to early 4th-century CE. These inscriptions are related to Buddhism and to the Shaivism tradition of Hinduism, and parts of them reflect both standard Sanskrit and hybridized Sanskrit. An earlier hybrid Sanskrit inscription found on Amaravati slab is dated to the late 2nd-century, while a few later ones include Sanskrit inscriptions along with Prakrit inscriptions related to Hinduism and Buddhism. After the 3rd-century CE, Sanskrit inscriptions dominate and many have survived.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "276_10749", "text": "Historically, the Batak languages were written using the Batak script, but the Latin script is now used for most writing.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "170_15985", "text": "Latino sine flexione (\"Latin without inflections\"), Interlingua de Academia pro Interlingua (IL de ApI) or Peano's Interlingua (abbreviated as IL) is an international auxiliary language compiled by the Academia pro Interlingua under the chairmanship of the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (1858\u20131932) from 1887 until 1914.

The only extant member of the Oghuric group that is still spoken today is the Chuvash language. The language persisted in the Volga region up until the 13th or 14th century. Although there is no direct evidence, some scholars believe it gave rise to modern Chuvash language while others support the idea Chuvash is an another distinct Oghur Turkic language.Italian historian and philologist Igor de Rachewiltz noted a significant distinction of the Chuvash language from other Turkic languages. According to him, the Chuvash language does not share certain common characteristics with Turkic languages to such a degree that some scholars consider Chuvash as an independent branch from Turkic and Mongolic. The Turkic classification of Chuvash was seen as a compromise solution for classification purposes.Definition of verbs in Volga Bulgar\nVolga Bulgars left some inscriptions in tombstones. There are few surviving inscriptions in the Volga Bulgar language, as the language was primarily an oral language and the Volga Bulgars did not develop a writing system until much later in their history. After converting to Islam, some of these inscriptions were written using Arabic letters while the use of the Orkhon script continued. Mahmud al-Kashgari provides some information about the language of the Volga Bulgars, whom he refers to as Bulghars. Some scholars suggest Hunnic had strong ties with Bulgar and to modern Chuvash and classify this grouping as separate Hunno-Bulgar languages. However, such speculations are not based on proper linguistic evidence, since the language of the Huns is almost unknown except for a few attested words and personal names. Scholars generally consider Hunnish as unclassifiable.Numbers and Vocabulary in Volga Bulgar\nMahmud al-Kashgari also provides some examples of Volga Bulgar words, poems, and phrases in his dictionary.. However, Mahmud al-Kashgari himself wasn't a native speaker of Volga Bulgar.

On 1 January 2019, the reformed Act on Forenames and Surnames came into force.Finnish given names are often of Christian origin (e.g., Jukka from Greek Johannes), but Finnish and Swedish origins are also common.\nIn Finnish, the letter \"j\" denotes the approximant [j], as in English you. For example, the two different names Maria and Marja are pronounced nearly identically. The letter \"y\" denotes the vowel [y], not found in English, but similar to German \"\u00fc\" and French \"u\". \"R\" is rolled. The stress is always on the first syllable in Finnish. For example, Yrj\u00f6 K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen is pronounced [\u02c8yrj\u00f8 \u02c8k\u00e6\u02d0ri\u00e6i\u032fnen]. Double letters always stand for a geminate or longer sound (e.g., Marjaana has a stressed short [\u0251] followed by an unstressed long [\u0251\u02d0] and then another unstressed short [\u0251]). As per Finnish phonotactics, both Finnish first names and surnames usually end in vowels, and always in either a vowel or a coronal consonant. This occurs regardless of gender, and surnames are no longer marked by gender.\nPronunciation of Swedish names is similar, but long vowels are not doubled and the stress may be on any syllable. Finland has a long bilingual history and it is not unusual for Finnish speakers to have Swedish surnames or given names. Such names may be pronounced according to Finland\u2013Swedish phonology or, depending on the person named, the person speaking and the language used, a Fennicized variant.\nWhen writing Finnish names without the Finnish alphabet available (such as in e-mail addresses), the letters \"\u00e4\" and \"\u00f6\" are usually replaced with \"a\" and \"o\", respectively (e.g., P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen as Paakkonen). This is not the same, but visually recognizable.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "30_1674", "text": "Historically, the language used on both sides of the river was Finnish. In the late 19th century, schools were opened in both countries. Then there was a decision to make the Swedish part of area Swedish speaking by teaching the school children only  written Swedish and allowing only Swedish to be spoken during lessons, sometimes also during breaks. As an effect, during the second half of the 20th century, Swedish was the dominant language on the Swedish side. The Finnish spoken in informal conversation is similar on both sides of the river, although some newer words differ. To support the traditional language on the Swedish side a new written language has been devised, Me\u00e4nkieli. On the Finnish side only Finnish is used in written communication. These two languages differ considerably in spelling.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_6050", "text": "Finland has three predominant surname traditions: the West Finnish, the East Finnish and that of the Swedish nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie and military. Until the early 20th century, Finland was a predominantly agrarian society and the names of West Finns were based on their association with a particular area, farm, or homestead (e.g. Jaakko Jussila 'Jaakko from the place of Jussi'). Farm names typically had the suffix -la, -l\u00e4, i.e. \"(place) of\", and could refer to the husband (like Jussila) or describe the location (e.g. Isoaho 'large clearing'). This name could change every time the person moved to a different farm. Multiple names could be recorded in documents, such that for example Pentti Jussila l. Penttil\u00e4 would be a person named Pentti who had moved from Jussila farm to Penttil\u00e4 farm. Also, even if one had a surname, one would still be better known by the farm name. Farm names, patronyms and village names could be used to disambiguate between different people, but they were not true inherited surnames. For example, in Aleksis Kivi's novel Seven Brothers (1870) the character Juhani was officially summoned as Juhani Juhanin-poika Jukola, Toukolan kyl\u00e4st\u00e4, in English 'Juhani, son of Juhani, from Jukola farm, Toukola village'.\nOn the other hand, the East Finnish surname tradition dates back to the 13th century. There, the Savonians pursued slash-and-burn agriculture which necessitated moving several times during a person's lifetime. This in turn required the families to have surnames, which were in wide use among the common folk as early as the 13th century. By the mid-16th century, the East Finnish surnames had become hereditary. Typically, the oldest East Finnish surnames were formed from the first names of the patriarchs of the families (e.g. Ik\u00e4valko, Termonen, Pentik\u00e4inen). In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, new names were most often formed by adding the place name of the former or current place of residence (e.g., Puumalainen < \"of Puumala\"). In the East Finnish tradition, women carried the family name of their fathers in feminine form indicated by the -tar suffix (e.g. Puumalatar < Puumalainen). By the 19th century, this practice fell into disuse due to the influence of Western European surname tradition. Also, women did not change their surnames with marriage.\nIn 1921, surnames became compulsory for all Finns. At this point, if there was no surname, the homestead names were usually adopted as surnames. Because the inhabitants often included farmhands and other non-family member, holders of the same surname are not necessarily genetically related. A typical feature of such names is the addition of prefixes Ala- or Ali- ('Lower') and Yl\u00e4- or Yli- ('Upper'), giving the location of the holding along a waterway in relation to the main holding (e.g. Yli-Ojanper\u00e4, Ala-Verronen). In Pohjanmaa, there are similar prefixes Rinta- and Latva- ('downstream' and 'upstream' respectively).\nCommon suffixes are -nen (in oblique form -se-; e.g., Miettinen : Miettisen \"Miettinen's\"), a diminutive suffix usually meaning \"small\", and -la/-l\u00e4, a locative suffix usually meaning \"(place) of\". The -nen suffix was freely interchanged with -son or -poika as late as the 16th century, but its meaning was ambiguous as it could refer not only to a \"son\", but any member of a patriarch's family, a farm or even a place. For example, the surname Tuomonen could mean \"Son of Tuomo\" or \"Farm of Tuomo\" or something else belonging to Tuomo.\nA third tradition of surnames was introduced into Finland by the Swedish-speaking upper and middle classes which used typical German and Swedish surnames. By custom, all Finnish-speaking people who were able to get a position of some status in urban or learned society, discarded their Finnish name, adopting a Swedish, German or (in case of clergy) a Latin surname. In the case of enlisted soldiers, the new name was given regardless of the wishes of the individual. The oldest noble surnames of Swedish origin were not original, but were derived from the charges in the coat of arms, sigil and flag of the family, for example with Sv\u00e4rd (Swedish: \"sword\"), Kurki/Kurck (Finnish: \"crane\") and Kirves (Finnish: \"axe\").  Families of German origin would use the von suffix (e.g., von Wright).\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the overall modernization process and especially, the political movement of Fennicization brought forth a movement towards the adoption of Finnish surnames. At that time, many people with a Swedish or otherwise foreign surname changed their family name to a Finnish one. The features of nature with endings -o/\u00f6, -nen (Meri\u00f6 < meri \"sea\", Nieminen < niemi \"peninsula\") are typical of the names of this era, as well as more or less direct translations of Swedish names (Helleranta < H\u00e4llstrand). Fennicizing one's name also concealed non-Finnish origin. For example, Martti Ahtisaari's grandfather was Adolfsen from Norway. Nevertheless, Fennicization was not mandatory and thus it is common to find entirely Finnish-speaking families with Swedish surnames; having a Swedish name does not imply one is a Swedish speaker.\nAn effect of industrialization was that large numbers of people moved to the cities and towns and had to adopt a surname. Missing an inherited surname, they invented theirs. Initially, these were in Swedish, and they were not very stable; people called them \"superfluous names\" (liikanimi), and a person could change one's surname several times during their career. Later, Finnish became the preferred language, and themes were taken from nature. Some of the most common examples of this type are Laine \"wave\", Vainio \"cultivated field\", Nurmi \"grassland\", and Salo \"grove\". When applicable, -nen or -la/-l\u00e4 could be suffixed, such as in Koskinen \"rapids + nen\".\nSharing a surname does not imply that the two people are related. Regulation of surnames to prevent two families from sharing the same name only began with the 1921 act. Before this, multiple families could have had Fennicized or otherwise changed their surnames to the same name. For example, the Finnish name Rautavaara was adopted by persons with the former Swedish names Sirius, Rosenqvist, Backman, J\u00e4rnberg, Granlund and Mattson. Similarly, the adoption of farm names as surnames by unrelated persons living on the same farm contributed to the number of these shared names.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_6052", "text": "The native Finnish tradition of first names was lost during the early Christian period, and by the 16th century, only Christian first names were accepted. The popular names were usually the names of saints whose cult was widespread. This resulted in some differences between the Western and Eastern Finnish first names, as the names in Eastern Finland might have had forms derived from Russian or Church Slavonic, instead of Swedish and Latin. For example, there are two Finnish cognates of George, Yrj\u00f6 < Swedish \u00d6rjan and Jyri < Russian \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 (Yuri). The most important source for researching the name forms actually used by the Finns themselves in the 15th to 18th centuries are the surnames preserved in written sources, as these were often formed on the basis of a first name. The first names themselves are usually given in Swedish or Latin forms, as these are the languages used in the records. The name actually used was a Fennicized form of the name, which might have changed as the person became older. For example, a person given the Swedish name Gustaf in the parish register might be called Kustu as a child, Kusti as an adolescent, Ky\u00f6sti or K\u00f6pi as an adult and Kustaa as an old man.In the early 19th century, almost all Finnish first names were taken from the official almanac, published by the Royal Academy of Turku, later by the University of Helsinki. The names were mostly names of the saints whose cults had been popular before the Reformation, but the almanac also incorporated a number of names from the Old Testament and Swedish royalty, which were added to certain days during the 17th and 18th centuries. During the 19th century, the Finnish forms were gradually added to the Finnish almanac, while the Swedish and Latin forms were removed (the Swedish forms were retained in a separate Swedish almanac). At the same time, the vicars gradually started to use Finnish name forms in parish registers. This, in turn, cemented the Finnish name forms that were used.\nNames with originally Finnish etymologies were revived in the 19th century. In the absence of reliable information about ancient names, parents chose names of mythical characters from folklore (Aino, Tapio), and many new names were created from Finnish words (Seppo \"smith\" or \"skilled person\", Ritva \"birch twig\"). Some clergymen initially refused to christen babies with such \"pagan\" names. The first given name of Finnish origin, Aino, was accepted in the almanac in 1890, followed by numerous others in 1908. About 30% of Finns born in 1910\u20131939 received a name with Finnish etymology.By the 1930s, the use of Finnish names and name variants was stabilized, and most of the popular names were noted in the almanac. Since then, the almanac has been gradually changed to include new, popular names. At present, all names which have at least 1,000 bearers are incorporated into the almanac of the University of Helsinki and given a \"name day\" (Finnish: nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4). In 2010, 792 of the 35,000 first names used in Finland were listed in the Finnish almanac. The name day calendar follows the Medieval Catholic saints' calendar when applicable.\nFirst names are subject to changing fashions, while second or third given names are more traditional and typically trisyllabic. In the table below, both first and given names are counted. Since the digitalization of the Finnish national population database in the 1970s, the most popular names in Finland (of all Finnish residents or citizens who have lived after that point) have been listed by \nOf the names listed, Annikki and Marjatta are etymologically related to Anna and Maria, but they are characters in the Kalevala, not used as given names before the 19th century.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At any one time there is a release version, which corresponds to the released version of R, and a development version, which corresponds to the development version of R. Most users will find the release version appropriate for their needs. In addition there are many genome annotation packages available that are mainly, but not solely, oriented towards different types of microarrays.\nWhile computational methods continue to be developed to interpret biological data, the Bioconductor project is an open source software repository that hosts a wide range of statistical tools developed in the R programming environment. Utilizing a rich array of statistical and graphical features in R, many Bioconductor packages have been developed to meet various data analysis needs. The use of these packages provides a basic understanding of the R programming / command language. As a result, R and Bioconductor packages, which have a strong computing background, are used by most biologists who will benefit significantly from their ability to analyze datasets. All these results provide biologists with easy access to the analysis of genomic data without requiring programming expertise.\nThe project was started in the Fall of 2001 and is overseen by the Bioconductor core team, based primarily at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, with other members coming from international institutions.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6111", "text": "Documentation and reproducible research.

Others provide a more thorough overview of the package or might even discuss general issues related to the package. In the future, the Bioconductor project is looking towards providing vignettes that are not specifically tied to a package, but rather are demonstrating more complex concepts. As with all aspects of the Bioconductor project, users are encouraged to participate in this effort.\nStatistical and graphical methods. The Bioconductor project aims to provide access to a wide range of powerful statistical and graphical methods for the analysis of genomic data. Analysis packages are available for: pre-processing Affymetrix and Illumina, cDNA array data; identifying differentially expressed genes; graph theoretical analyses; plotting genomic data. In addition, the R package system itself provides implementations for a broad range of state-of-the-art statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and non-linear modeling, cluster analysis, prediction, resampling, survival analysis, and time series analysis.\nGenome annotation. The Bioconductor project provides software for associating microarray and other genomic data in real time to biological metadata from web databases such as GenBank, LocusLink and PubMed (annotate package). Functions are also provided for incorporating the results of statistical analysis in HTML reports with links to annotation WWW resources. Software tools are available for assembling and processing genomic annotation data, from databases such as GenBank, the Gene Ontology Consortium, LocusLink, UniGene, the UCSC Human Genome Project and others with the AnnotationDbi package.

All contributions are expected to exist under an open source license such as Artistic 2.0, GPL2, or BSD. There are many different reasons why open-source software is beneficial to the analysis of microarray data and to computational biology in general.

Interviewed in 2014, the composer Harrison Birtwistle declared that Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre \"is the kind of piece, in all the noise of contemporary music that's gone on in my lifetime, I'd like to have written\". Another British composer, George Benjamin, described the work as \"a breakthrough. It is a work in which you can also hear the profound influence of extra-European music, above all from Asia and Africa. This radically alters the sonority and the music's sense of time and direction, as well as its expressive viewpoint and ethos\". One of the most enthusiastic and influential early testimonials came from Igor Stravinsky, who praised the work as an exemplar of \"a new and wonderfully supple kind of music\".However, according to Howard Goodall, the sixty years since its premi\u00e8re have failed to grant Le marteau an equally enthusiastic endorsement from the general public. \"While Boulez's iconoclasm was attractive to some students of twentieth-century classical music, who venerated\u2026 Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre,\u2026 most neutral listeners then as now found both his polemic and his music thoroughly impenetrable\". Despite its attractive surface, its \"smooth sheen of pretty sounds\", issues remain about the music's deeper comprehensibility for the ordinary listener. Even Stravinsky's ear struggled to hear some of the work's polyphonic textures: \"One follows the line of only a single instrument and is content to be 'aware of' the others. Perhaps later the second line and the third will be familiar, but one mustn't try to hear them in the tonal-harmonic sense\". But if we are supposed not to listen in the tonal-harmonic sense, what exactly is it that we should hear and understand in a work which, in the words of Alex Ross, features \"nothing so vulgar as a melody or a steady beat\"? Stravinsky said that repeated hearings, through the availability of recordings, would aid performers more quickly to overcome technical difficulties presented by the music: \"If a work like Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre had been written before the present era of recording it would have reached young musicians outside of the principal cities only years later. As it is this same Marteau, considered so difficult to perform a few years ago, is now within the technique of many players, thanks to their being taught by record\".\nWriting some 40 years since Le Marteau first appeared, composer and music psychologist Fred Lerdahl criticized Koblyakov's approach to analyzing Le Marteau: For one thing, competent listeners to Le Marteau, even after many hearings, still cannot even begin to hear its serial organization, ... [though] [e]xperienced listeners do not find Le Marteau totally incomprehensible. ... Of course a musician of Boulez's calibre would not use a compositional system without drawing crucially upon his musical intuition and experience. Music-generating algorithms alone have always produced primitive outputs; not enough is known about musical composition and cognition for them to succeed. Boulez had the intellectually less ambitious goal of developing a system that could just produce a quantity of musical material having a certain consistency. He then shaped his material more or less intuitively, using both his \"ear\" and various unacknowledged constraints. In so doing, he listened much as another listener might. The organization deciphered by Koblyakov was just a means, and not the only one, towards an artistic end. Lerdahl cautions, however, that \"There is no obvious relationship between the comprehensibility of a piece and its value\". While considering \"complicatedness to be a neutral value and complexity to be a positive one\", and therefore that only musical surfaces leading to complexity employ \"the full potential of our cognitive resources\", many kinds of music satisfy such criteria (e.g., Indian raga, Japanese koto, jazz, and most Western art music), while other types \"fall short\": Balinese gamelan because of its \"primitive pitch space\" and rock music on grounds of \"insufficient complexity\", while much contemporary music (without specific reference to Boulez) \"pursues complicatedness as compensation for a lack of complexity\".Roger Scruton finds Boulez's preoccupation with timbre and sonority in the instrumental writing has the effect of preventing \"simultaneities from coalescing as chords\". As a result, Scruton says that, especially where pitches are concerned, Le Marteau \"contains no recognizable material \u2013 no units of significance that can live outside the work that produces them\". Scruton also feels that the involved overlapping metres notated in the score beg \"a real question as to whether we hear the result as a rhythm at all\". Richard Taruskin found \"Le Marteau exemplified the lack of concern on the part of modernist composers for the comprehensibility of their music\". Equally bluntly, Christopher Small, writing in 1987 said \"It is not possible to invoke any 'inevitable time lag' which is supposed to be required for the assimilation of ...such critically acclaimed works as... Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre... Those who champion 'the new music' await its assimilation into the repertory much as the early Christians awaited the Second Coming\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_6929", "text": "La B\u00eate \u00e0 Ma\u00eet' Belhomme is a short story written by Guy de Maupassant.

The text is partially sung, partially interpreted through purely instrumental passages.\"\nDespite having been published in 1954 and 1957, analysts were unable to explain Boulez's compositional methods until Lev Koblyakov in 1977. This is partially due to the fact that Boulez believes in strict control tempered with \"local indiscipline\", or rather, the freedom to choose small, individual elements while still adhering to an overall structure compatible with serialist principles. Boulez opts to change individual notes based on sound or harmony, choosing to abandon adherence to the structure dictated by strict serialism, making the detailed serial organization of the piece difficult for the listener to discern.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is generally considered the Anglo-Norman form of the Germanic compound *gud\u0105 'god' and *fri\u00feuz 'peace'. It is a derivative of Dutch Godfried, German Gottfried and Old English Gotfrith and Godfrith.\nAlexander Macbain considered it as being found in the Gaelic and Welsh forms; potentially before or contemporary to the Anglo-Saxon, with the examples of Goraidh, Middle Gaelic Gofraig (1467 MS.), Godfrey (do.), Irish Gofraidh (F.M.), Middle Irish Gothfrith, Gofraig (Tigernach, 989), Early Irish Gothfraid (Lib.

Popularity of the name declined after the medieval period, but it was revived in modern England and the British Empire at large.

The graphic e after G is used in French to avoid the pronunciation [\u0261o], but [\u0292\u0254] instead. The spelling Geo- is probably due to the influence of the first name Georges, derived from Old French Jorre, Joire.\nThe Old Frankish name Godefrid itself is from the Germanic elements god- and frid-. The Middle Latin form is Godefridus (whence also Godfrey). The second element is widely used in Germanic names, and has a meaning of \"peace, protection\". The first element god- is conflated from two, or possibly three, distinct roots, ie got and possibly *gaut, in origin a tribal name (Geats, Goths) or a theonym (a byname of Wotan).Albert Dauzat (1951, rev. ed. 1980) followed by others, argued that the Middle French name Geoffrey in fact retains a distinction between two Germanic names which became conflated in the Middle Ages. According to this argument, Godfrey continues *goda-fri\u00feu-, while Geoffroy continues *gaut-fri\u00feu-. If a strictly phonetic development is assumed, Geoffrey cannot be derived from Godfrid, as *go- would result in Old French go- [\u0261\u0254] and not geo- (jo-, [d\u0292\u0254]), ie goda-fridu would yield Godefroy [\u0261odfrwa] but not Geoffroy.\nOn the other hand, *gau- [\u0261aw] would regularly result in jo- (geo- [d\u0292\u0254]), i.e *gaut-fridu- would regularly result in Geoffroy [d\u0292\u0254f:rwa].\nAlternative suggestions which would derive the first element from Germanic gisal- 'hostage', or w(e)alah 'Gallo-Roman; stranger' are also rejected by Dauzat as phonetically impossible: gi would have resulted in Old French [d\u0292i] (Modern French [\u0292i]), as in Gisalbert > Gilbert (ie *Gisalfrid > *Giffrey), and *w(e)alh- would have resulted in *gaul- [\u0261ol] (ie *Wealhfrid > *Gaulfrey, *Gauffrey).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_28245", "text": "Janua linguarum reserata (English: The Door of Languages Unlocked, often mistranslated as The Gate of Languages and the like) is a textbook written by John Amos Comenius in 1629.

In 1923 Aftenposten adopted the Norwegian spelling standard of 1907, which mainly replaced the \"soft\" consonants (e.g. d, b) characteristic of Danish pronunciation (but also used in some Norwegian dialects) with \"hard\" consonants (e.g. t, p) characteristic of Eastern Central Norwegian pronunciation, but which was otherwise mostly identical with Danish.

Due to its status as the country's largest and most influential newspaper, Aftenposten therefore had a significant influence on the developments that took place during the Norwegian language struggle. The \"moderate\" or \"conservative\" Riksm\u00e5l language used by Aftenposten was mainly associated with a conservative stance in Norwegian politics, and was contrasted with the \"radical\" Samnorsk language, an attempt to merge Bokm\u00e5l with Nynorsk which was promoted by socialist governments in the 1950s. By 1960 it had become apparent that the Samnorsk attempt had failed, and as a result, Aftenposten's Riksm\u00e5l standard and the government-promoted Bokm\u00e5l standard have in the following decades become almost identical as the Bokm\u00e5l standard has incorporated nearly all of Riksm\u00e5l. As a consequence, Aftenposten decided to describe its language as \"Moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" from 2006, and published its own dictionary, based on Riksm\u00e5l and Moderate Bokm\u00e5l, but excluding \"radical\" (i.e. similar to Nynorsk) variants of Bokm\u00e5l.\nThe online version of the paper for some years during the early 2000s had an English section.

C. Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger in late 1922. The first issue, dated March 1923, appeared on newsstands February 18. The first editor, Edwin Baird, printed early work by H. P. Lovecraft, Seabury Quinn, and Clark Ashton Smith, all of whom went on to be popular writers, but within a year, the magazine was in financial trouble.  Henneberger sold his interest in the publisher, Rural Publishing Corporation, to Lansinger, and refinanced Weird Tales, with Farnsworth Wright as the new editor.  The first issue to list Wright as editor was dated November 1924.  The magazine was more successful under Wright, and despite occasional financial setbacks, it prospered over the next 15 years.  Under Wright's control, the magazine lived up to its subtitle, \"The Unique Magazine\", and published a wide range of unusual fiction.\nLovecraft's Cthulhu mythos stories first appeared in Weird Tales, starting with \"The Call of Cthulhu\" in 1928.  These were well-received, and a group of writers associated with Lovecraft wrote other stories set in the same milieu.  Robert E. Howard was a regular contributor, and published several of his Conan the Barbarian stories in the magazine, and Seabury Quinn's series of stories about Jules de Grandin, a detective who specialized in cases involving the supernatural, was very popular with the readers.  Other well-liked authors included Nictzin Dyalhis, E. Hoffmann Price, Robert Bloch, and H. Warner Munn.  Wright published some science fiction, along with the fantasy and horror, partly because when Weird Tales was launched,  no magazines were specializing in science fiction, but he continued this policy even after the launch of magazines such as Amazing Stories in 1926.  Edmond Hamilton wrote a good deal of science fiction for Weird Tales, though after a few years, he used the magazine for his more fantastic stories, and submitted his space operas elsewhere.\nIn 1938, the magazine was sold to William Delaney, the publisher of Short Stories, and within two years, Wright, who was ill, was replaced by Dorothy McIlwraith as editor.  Although some successful new authors and artists, such as Ray Bradbury and Hannes Bok, continued to appear, the magazine is considered by critics to have declined under McIlwraith from its heyday in the 1930s.  Weird Tales ceased publication in 1954, but since then, numerous attempts have been made to relaunch the magazine, starting in 1973.  The longest-lasting version began in 1988 and ran with an occasional hiatus for over 20 years under an assortment of publishers. In the mid-1990s, the title was changed to Worlds of Fantasy and Horror because of licensing issues, the original title returning in 1998.\nThe magazine is regarded by historians of fantasy and science fiction as a legend in the field, Robert Weinberg considering it \"the most important and influential of all fantasy magazines\".  Weinberg's fellow historian, Mike Ashley, describes it as \"second only to Unknown in significance and influence\", adding that \"somewhere in the imagination reservoir of all U.S. (and many non-U.S.) genre-fantasy and horror writers is part of the spirit of Weird Tales\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6320", "text": "Henneberger gave Weird Tales the subtitle \"The Unique Magazine\" from the first issue.

According to him, the Chuvash language does not share certain common characteristics with Turkic languages to such a degree that some scholars consider Chuvash as an independent branch from Turkic and Mongolic. The Turkic classification of Chuvash was seen as a compromise solution for classification purposes.Definition of verbs in Volga Bulgar\nVolga Bulgars left some inscriptions in tombstones. There are few surviving inscriptions in the Volga Bulgar language, as the language was primarily an oral language and the Volga Bulgars did not develop a writing system until much later in their history. After converting to Islam, some of these inscriptions were written using Arabic letters while the use of the Orkhon script continued. Mahmud al-Kashgari provides some information about the language of the Volga Bulgars, whom he refers to as Bulghars. Some scholars suggest Hunnic had strong ties with Bulgar and to modern Chuvash and classify this grouping as separate Hunno-Bulgar languages.

A survey conducted in the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) found Misirkov to be \"the most significant Macedonian of the 20th century\". For his efforts to codify a standard Macedonian language, he is often considered \"the founder of the modern Macedonian literary language\".On the other hand, he was one of the founders of the pro-Bulgarian Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Circle established in 1900 in St. Petersburg. In 1905 he began publishing predominantly articles, written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective in the IMARO-affiliated press. In his diary written during the Balkan Wars, he espoused pro-Bulgarian views. During the First World War, he became a member of the local parliament in Bessarabia as a representative of the Bulgarian minority there. During the 1920s he encouraged the Macedonian Slavs to adopt a Bulgarian national identity. Misirkov returned to Macedonian nationalism for a period in 1914 and again in 1924 and 1925. Misirkov died in 1926 and was buried in the Sofia Central Cemetery with the financial support from the Ministry of Education, as an honoured Bulgarian educator.\nBecause Misirkov expressed conflicting views about the national identity of the Macedonian Slavs at different points in his life, his national affiliation and legacy remain a matter of dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia. While Misirkov's work and personality remain highly controversial and disputed, there have been attempts among international scholars to reconcile the conflicting and self-contradictory statements made by Misirkov. According to historian Ivo Banac, Misirkov viewed both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians, and espoused pan-Bulgarian patriotism in a larger Balkan context. However, in the context of the larger Bulgarian unit/nation, Misirkov sought both cultural and national differentiation from the other Bulgarians and called both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia, Macedonians.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27171", "text": "\"The Song of the Stormy Petrel\" (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f \u043e \u0411\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435, Pesnya o Burevestnike/Pes\u0144a o Burevestnike) is a short piece of revolutionary literature written by the Russian writer Maxim Gorky in 1901.

This is because Prakrit, in its multiple variants, had been favoured since the time of the influential Edicts of Ashoka (circa 250 BCE).Besides a few examples from the 1st century BCE, most of the early Sanskrit inscriptions date to the time of the Indo-Scythian rulers, either the Northern Satraps around Mathura for the earliest ones, or, slightly later, the closely related Western Satraps in western and central India. It is thought that they became promoters of Sanskrit as a way to show their attachment to Indian culture: according to Salomon \"their motivation in promoting Sanskrit was presumably a desire to establish themselves as legitimate Indian or at least Indianized rulers and to curry the favor of the educated Brahmanical elite\".\nIn western India, the first known inscription in Sanskrit appears to have been made by Ushavadata, son-in-law of the Western Satrap ruler Nahapana, at the front of Cave no.10 in the Nasik Caves. The inscription dates to the early 2nd century CE, and has hybrid features.\n\nThe Junagadh rock inscription of Western Satraps ruler Rudradaman I (c. 150 AD, Gujarat) is the first long inscription in fairly standard Sanskrit that has survived into the modern era. It represents a turning point in Sanskrit epigraphy, states Salomon, being \"the first extensive record in the poetic style\" in \"more or less standard Sanskrit\". The Rudradaman inscription is \"not pure classical Sanskrit\", but with few epic-vernacular Sanskrit exceptions, it approaches high classical Sanskrit. It is important because it is likely the prototype of the extensive Sanskrit inscriptions of the Gupta Empire era. These inscriptions are also in the Br\u0101hm\u012b script.\nDuring the reign of Rudradaman, circa 150 CE, it is also known that the Greek writer Yavanesvara translated the Yavanajataka from Greek to Sanskrit, for \"the use of those who could not speak Greek\", a translation which became an authority for all later astrology works in India.The spread of the usage of Sanskrit inscriptions to the south can also probably be attributed to the influence of the Western Satraps, who were in close relation with southern Indian rulers: according to Salomon \"a Nagarjunakonda memorial pillar inscription of the time of King Rudrapurusadatta attests to a marital alliance between the Western Ksatrapas and the Iksvaku rulers of Nagarjunakonda\". The Nagarjunakonda inscriptions are the earliest substantial South Indian Sanskrit inscriptions, probably from the late 3rd-century to early 4th-century CE. These inscriptions are related to Buddhism and to the Shaivism tradition of Hinduism, and parts of them reflect both standard Sanskrit and hybridized Sanskrit. An earlier hybrid Sanskrit inscription found on Amaravati slab is dated to the late 2nd-century, while a few later ones include Sanskrit inscriptions along with Prakrit inscriptions related to Hinduism and Buddhism. After the 3rd-century CE, Sanskrit inscriptions dominate and many have survived.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Bolstered by the lead single \"You Could Be Mine\", Use Your Illusion II was the slightly more popular of the two albums, selling a record 770,000 copies its first week and debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, ahead of Use Your Illusion I's first-week sales of 685,000.

In addition, Use Your Illusion II is more political than most of their previous work, with songs like \"Civil War\", a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\", and \"Get in the Ring\" dealing respectively with the topics of violence, law enforcement and media bias. The thematic material deals less with drug use than previous Guns N' Roses albums. Use Your Illusion I featured several songs pre-Appetite for Destruction while Use Your Illusion II featured more tracks written during and after Appetite for Destruction.\nThe band's cover of \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" had been released almost a year earlier on the Days of Thunder soundtrack, while \"Civil War\" debuted at the 1990 Farm Aid concert. That concert also featured Guns N' Roses playing a cover of the U.K. Subs song \"Down on the Farm\", a studio version of which would later appear on the band's 1993 release of cover songs, \"The Spaghetti Incident?\". \"Civil War\" was released as a B-side to \"You Could Be Mine\". The song had also been released on the charity album Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal, a fund-raising compilation for Romanian orphans.\n\"You Could Be Mine\" was released in June 1991 and is featured in the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The song was not released on the actual soundtrack. The band also filmed a video featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in character as the Terminator, with a loose plot featuring Axl Rose as its \"target\". However, he is saved from termination as he is deemed a \"waste of ammo\" by the T-800's lock-on system. The original subject matter of the song dealt with Izzy Stradlin's failed relationship with ex-girlfriend Angela Nicoletti.\nThe Use Your Illusion albums can be considered a single cohesive work, and certain elements of Use Your Illusion II underscore this intent. For instance, both albums have a version of the song \"Don't Cry\", and both have one cover song; \"Live and Let Die\" by Paul McCartney (Use Your Illusion I) and \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" by Bob Dylan (Use Your Illusion II). Each also has at least one track sung by other members of the band: lead vocals are performed by bassist Duff McKagan on \"So Fine\", a song that was dedicated to punk rock musician Johnny Thunders, who died from a drug overdose before the recording of the album.The song \"Get in the Ring\" finds the band lashing out at a career's worth of critics and enemies. Among those referred to by name are editors of several entertainment magazines. The industrial flavored \"My World\", the final track, was written and recorded in three hours, with Rose claiming those in the recording room were on mushrooms at the time.The band had some difficulty achieving the final sound, especially during the mixing stages of both albums. According to a 1991 cover story by Rolling Stone magazine, after mixing 21 tracks with engineer/producer Bob Clearmountain, the band fired Clearmountain when he tried to replace the real drums with samples. According to Slash's autobiography, \"one afternoon we discovered a notepad of his where he'd notated all the drum samples he planned to mix in over Matt's drum tracks\" the band decided to scrap the mixes and start from scratch with engineer Bill Price of Sex Pistols fame.Slash has stated that most of the material for the album was written on acoustic guitars in a couple of nights at his house (the Walnut House), after several months of non-productivity. According to Slash \"Breakdown\" was one of the most complicated songs to record on the album; the banjo, drum, and piano parts were hard to synchronize and drummer Matt Sorum \"lost it\" a couple of times trying to get the drums just right. The song \"Locomotive\" was written in a house Slash and Izzy Stradlin rented in the Hollywood Hills following the Appetite for Destruction tours.

Although deeming I the better record, USA Today's Edna Gundersen called II similarly \"rebellious, ambitious and powerful\". In NME, Mary Anne Hobbs panned both albums for their \"dreadfully laboured feel\" and \"asinine\" lyrics; as examples of the latter, she cited the \"gratuitous sexism\" of \"Pretty Tied Up\" and \"slack political rhetoric\" of \"Civil War\". Robert Christgau was unimpressed by II apart from \"Civil War\", which he designated as a \"choice cut\" in The Village Voice.In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Use Your Illusion II as \"more serious and ambitious than I, but ... also considerably more pretentious\", finding it a tedious listen due to its \"pompous production and poor pacing\" despite commending the \"nervy energy\" of certain songs. Ann Powers was more complimentary in the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, calling it \"spacier\" than I while noting that \"Yesterdays\" and \"You Could Be Mine\" show that Guns N' Roses \"can still focus to great effect\". Both Use Your Illusion records were jointly ranked 41st on Rolling Stone's 2010 list of the best albums of the 1990s.It was the first time that two albums by one band or artist had entered the US charts at the number one and two spots and Guns N' Roses became the first to have the top two biggest selling albums on the chart since Jim Croce in 1974.

With their producer, Nigel Godrich, Radiohead recorded most of OK Computer in their rehearsal space in Oxfordshire and the historic mansion of St Catherine's Court in Bath in 1996 and early 1997. They distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work.\nThe album's lyrics depict a dystopian, futuristic world fraught with rampant consumerism, capitalism, social and modern alienation, emotional isolation and political malaise, with overall themes like transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism; in this capacity, OK Computer is said to have prescient insight into the mood of 21st-century life. The band used unconventional production techniques, including natural reverberation, and no audio separation. Strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Most of the album was recorded live.\nDespite lowered sales estimates by EMI, who deemed the record uncommercial and difficult to market, OK Computer reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and debuted at number 21 on the Billboard 200, Radiohead's highest album entry on the US charts at the time, and was soon certified five times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. \"Paranoid Android\", \"Karma Police\", \"Lucky\" and \"No Surprises\" were released as singles.

Critics described it as a landmark release of far-reaching impact and importance, but noted that its experimentalism made it a challenging listen. According to Tim Footman, \"Not since 1967, with the release of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, had so many major critics agreed immediately, not only on an album's merits, but on its long-term significance, and its ability to encapsulate a particular point in history.\" In the British press, the album garnered favourable reviews in NME, Melody Maker, The Guardian and Q. Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that \"Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years' time I'm betting OK Computer will be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era.\" John Harris wrote in Select: \"Every word sounds achingly sincere, every note spewed from the heart, and yet it roots itself firmly in a world of steel, glass, random-access memory and prickly-skinned paranoia.\"The album was well received by critics in North America. Rolling Stone, Spin, the Los Angeles Times, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pitchfork and the Daily Herald published positive reviews. In The New Yorker, Alex Ross praised its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead's risk-taking with the musically conservative \"dadrock\" of their contemporaries Oasis. Ross wrote: \"Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are extreme ... This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock.\" Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork lauded the record's emotional appeal, writing that it \"is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing\".Reviews for Entertainment Weekly, the Chicago Tribune, and Time were mixed. Robert Christgau from The Village Voice said Radiohead immersed Yorke's vocals in \"enough electronic marginal distinction to feed a coal town for a month\" to compensate for the \"soulless\" songs, resulting in \"arid\" art rock. In an otherwise positive review, Andy Gill wrote for The Independent: \"For all its ambition and determination to break new ground, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes.

The songs were written by singer Mark Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene and the album was compiled from a lengthy recording process at London's Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988. Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances that drew on elements of jazz, ambient, blues, classical music, and dub. These long-form recordings were then heavily edited and re-arranged into an album in mostly digital format.\nSpirit of Eden was a radical departure from Talk Talk's earlier and more accessible albums.

Despite its mixed reception, the album's stature grew more favourable in subsequent years, with contemporary critics describing Spirit of Eden as an underrated masterpiece, and early progenitor of the post-rock genre.

The single failed to breach the UK Singles Chart Top 75. Around August, Tim Pope directed a music video for \"I Believe in You\", featuring Hollis sitting with his guitar, singing the lyrics. \"That was a massive mistake,\" said Hollis. \"I thought just by sitting there and listening and really thinking about what it was about, I could get that in my eyes. But you cannot do it. It just feels stupid.\"The band did not tour in support of the album. Hollis explained, \"There is no way that I could ever play again a lot of the stuff I played on this album because I just wouldn't know how to.

By the time the masters were delivered later in the month, however, the label conceded that the album had been satisfactorily completed.Despite their reservations towards Spirit of Eden, EMI chose to exercise their option to extend the recording contract. The band, however, wanted out of the contract. \"I knew by that time that EMI was not the company this band should be with,\" manager Keith Aspden told Mojo. \"I was fearful that the money wouldn't be there to record another album.\" EMI and Talk Talk went to court to decide the issue.The case centred on whether EMI had notified the band in time about the contract extension. As part of the agreement, EMI had to send a written notice within three months after the completion of Spirit of Eden. The band said that EMI had sent the notice too late, arguing that the three-month period began once recording had finished; EMI argued that the three-month period did not begin until they were satisfied with the recording, on the basis that the definition of an \"album\" in the contract provided that the album had to be \"commercially satisfactory\". The band disputed this, particularly on the basis that there were no changes made to the album in the space between its recording and eventual release. Justice Andrew Morritt ruled in favour of EMI, but his decision was overturned in the Court of Appeal. Talk Talk were released from the contract and later signed to Polydor.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "407_302", "question": "Which language was Gallagher written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_6506", "text": "Gallagher is an Irish surname. It originates from the Irish noble Gallagher family of County Donegal, Ireland. In Ireland, the anglicized version of the name \"Gallagher\" is pronounced /\u02c8\u0261\u0252l\u0259\u02cch\u0259r/ in County Donegal in Ulster, while elsewhere in the country it is most frequently pronounced as /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6l\u0259\u02cch\u0259r/. Outside Ireland, the pronunciation is often altered to /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6l\u0259\u02cc\u0261\u0259r/ in Britain and the USA. The name Gallagher is an anglicization of the Irish surname \u00d3 Gallchobhair, \u00d3 Gallchobhoir (or two alternative spelling forms, \u00d3 Gallch\u00f3ir and \u00d3 Gallach\u00f3ir), these being masculine forms; the corresponding feminine forms are N\u00ed Ghallchobhair (newer forms N\u00ed Ghallch\u00f3ir and N\u00ed Ghallach\u00f3ir). At least 30 recorded alternate variants exist, including O'Gallagher, Gallacher, Gallager, Gallaher, Gallocher, Galliher, Gollaher, Gollihar and Gallahue.\nThe earliest recorded incidence of the name is in a fragment of a manuscript currently in the Royal Library of Brussels, which states the name \"Gallchubhair\". A similarly earlier mention occurs in the Annals of the Four Masters, where it is recorded that Mael Cobo \u00dai Gallchobhar, Abbot of Scrin Adamnain, died in 1022 AD. Gallchobhar was the one given the role of founding father of the clan at the advent of widespread surname usage in Ireland, which began around the 10th century.\nAs with other modern Irish last names, \u00d3 Gallch\u00f3ir similarly appears to be a conjoined compound word.\nMost Gallaghers are found in the Americas, where approximately 60% of Gallaghers originate. The United States is the home to 55% of Gallaghers. Gallagher is also the most common surname in County Donegal (D\u00fan na nGall means \"fort of the foreigner\"), and thus is very common in Derry, and is the fourteenth-most-common by birth records in Ireland. In the United States, it was ranked by the 2020 US Census as the 482nd most common name.  According to Professor Edward MacLysaght, in the mid-20th century Gallagher was one of the most common Irish surnames, most of the recorded births being located in the northern province, Ulster, and the western province, Connacht, with the majority being recorded in the homeland of the sept\u2014County Donegal in Ulster.

It was financed by a fund-raising round from family and friends of the founders, brought together a few months earlier in a method dubbed the \"calendar multiplier\" by Ronai and Rosselin.\nThe magazine's publication was prescient, it was a time of important international news and the second issue sold 40,000. The issues published during the Gulf War, begun in January 1991, which translated Arab newspapers banned in France, were especially successful. A series of big world developments proved the viability of the concept: the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis described by Russian journalists, Algerian elections through the eyes of the Arab press, the Maastricht referendum as written about in Europe, and Bill Clinton's election as predicted by American newspapers.Jacques Rosselin, one of the founders, managed the magazine until the end of 1994, less than a year after it was bought by G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Occidentale (a subsidiary of Alcatel, which also owned L'Express and Le Point). The deal was completed in March 1994 for 83 million francs, though the magazine would wait until 1999 to break even. Courrier International  was then sold to Vivendi, together with L'Express, then to Le Monde group, which had looked to buy it since its creation.  Rosselin was succeeded by Bernard Wouts, who joined via G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Occidentale. Wouts, a former executive of le Monde, had met with the founders in 1989 but declined their offer to join the then fledgling magazine.Today the paper is part of Le Monde group and edited by Philippe Thureau-Dangin, who joined in 1993. A number of original employees are still there, the most senior are Hidenobu Suzuki and Kazuhiko Yatabe, who worked on number zero in June 1988.For its twentieth anniversary, on the 9 September 2010, Courrier international unveiled a new logo and layout. The redesign was accompanied by a marketing campaign which included an image of two planes circling, without colliding with, the digitally shortened towers of the World Trade Center in New York. The implication being that if the towers had been smaller there would have been no collision. The image, which illustrated the magazine's new slogan \u00ab Learn to anticipate \u00bb (\u00ab Apprendre \u00e0 anticiper \u00bb), solicited numerous negative reactions in the United States.In 2020 the circulation of Courier International was of 168,766 copies.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_5282", "text": "Vladimir Ivanovich Guerrier (Russian: \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0413\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435; 29 May [O.S. 17 May] 1837 \u2013 30 June 1919) was a Russian historian, professor of history at Moscow State University from 1868 to 1904.

It was performed in Italian by Gigliola Cinquetti representing Italy. Like all previous Italian Eurovision entries, the song had also won that year's Sanremo Music Festival. Cinquetti was sixteen years old, making her the youngest Eurovision winner in history until 1986 when Belgium's Sandra Kim won the contest with \"J'aime la vie\" \u2013 initially claiming to be fifteen, it was later revealed that Kim was only thirteen. In 1990, the EBU made a new rule requiring contestants to be aged 16 or older before the contest; this age rule still operates.\nThe song was performed twelfth on the night, following Portugal's Ant\u00f3nio Calv\u00e1rio with \"Ora\u00e7\u00e3o\" and preceding Yugoslavia's Sabahudin Kurt with \"\u017divot je sklopio krug\". By the close of voting, it had received 49 points, placing it first in a field of 16.\n\"Non ho l'et\u00e0\" became a considerable commercial success for Cinquetti, in Italy, the rest of Europe, Scandinavia and other countries worldwide; she also recorded the song in English (\"This is my prayer\"), Spanish (\"No tengo edad\"), French (\"Je suis \u00e0 toi\"), German (\"Luna nel blu\"), and Japanese (\"Yumemiru omoi\", \u5922\u307f\u308b\u60f3\u3044). The song has since been recorded by a wide range of artists in other languages, for example, in Icelandic as \"Heyr m\u00edna b\u00e6n\" by Ell\u00fd Vilhj\u00e1lms. Lili Ivanova, a famous Bulgarian singer, and Hong Kong singer Rebecca Pan, covered the song in 1964. Polish-Belarusian singer Wies\u0142awa Drojecka covered the song in Polish (\"Nie wolno mi\"). Anneli Sari made a Finnish cover (\"Liian nuori rakkauteen\"). Sandra Reemer recorded the song in Dutch (\"Als jij maar wacht\").\nThe song was followed as contest winner in 1965 by France Gall singing \"Poup\u00e9e de cire, poup\u00e9e de son\" for Luxembourg. It was followed as Italian representative that year by Bobby Solo with \"Se piangi, se ridi\".\nCinquetti later returned to perform at the contest in 1974, when she finished second with \"S\u00ec\", behind ABBA's \"Waterloo\". In 1991, she co-hosted the contest in Rome alongside Toto Cutugno. In 2022, she performed the song as an interval act at the Eurovision final in Turin.\nCinquetti was proved not to be a UK 'one-hit-wonder' when an English recording of her 1974 Eurovision entry (titled \"Go\") reached #8 in the UK chart.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "170_15985", "text": "Latino sine flexione (\"Latin without inflections\"), Interlingua de Academia pro Interlingua (IL de ApI) or Peano's Interlingua (abbreviated as IL) is an international auxiliary language compiled by the Academia pro Interlingua under the chairmanship of the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (1858\u20131932) from 1887 until 1914. It is a simplified version of Latin, and retains its vocabulary. Interlingua-IL was published in the journal Revue de Math\u00e9matiques in an article of 1903 entitled De Latino Sine Flexione, Lingua Auxiliare Internationale (meaning On Latin Without Inflection, International Auxiliary Language), which explained the reason for its creation. The article argued that other auxiliary languages were unnecessary, since Latin was already established as the world's international language. The article was written in classical Latin, but it gradually dropped its inflections until there were none.\nLanguage codes ISO 639: ISO 639-2 and -1 were requested on 23 July 2017 at the Library of Congress (proposed: IL and ILA); ISO-639-3 was requested on 10 August 2017 at SIL (proposed: ILC) and was rejected on 23 January 2018.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "170_15986", "text": "In 1903, Peano published the article De Latino Sine Flexione to introduce his language. In this work, Peano quoted a series of suggestions by Leibniz about a simplified form of Latin. The article appeared to be a serious development of the idea, and Peano subsequently gained a reputation among the auxiliary language movement.\nIn 1904, Peano undertook an essay about the way to obtain the minimal grammar of an eventual minimal Latin (Latino minimo), with a minimal vocabulary purely international.Peano and some colleagues published articles in Latino sine flexione for several years at the Revue de Math\u00e9matiques.  Because of his desire to prove that this was indeed an international language, Peano boldly published the final edition of his famous Formulario mathematico in Latino sine flexione. However, as Hubert Kennedy notes, most mathematicians were put off by the artificial appearance of the language, and made no attempt to read it.In October 1907, Peano was at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in Paris to take part in the Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language. Having declared for Latino sine flexione to be adopted, he eventually could not participate in the final voting, because of labour affairs at Turin.On 26 December 1908, Peano was elected member and director of the Akademi internasional de lingu universal still using Idiom Neutral, which was refounded one year later under the name Academia pro Interlingua. Every academician might use their favourite form of Interlingua, the term being initially used in a general sense as a synonym for international language, yet it soon began to be specially used to denote a reformed Latino sine flexione based on the common rules the academicians were reaching by frequent votings. Thus, the name Interlingua soon began to denote the language evolving from the Academia Pro Interlingua, with the corresponding abbreviation IL.\nHowever, every member was free to write in their own personal style, and indeed some members were proposing radical reforms which eventually might end up as independent languages (like Michaux's Romanal or De Wahl's Interlingue). For this reason, the name Peano's Interlingua or Interlingua (IL) might be regarded as the most accurate for the particular standard by Peano. (As found in \"Interglossa and its predecessors\".)\nThe discussions to reach a standard Interlingua may be seen on the pages of Discussiones, the official journal of the Academia pro Interlingua from 1909 to 1913. This and subsequent journals of the academy have been recently published in a CD-Rom by the mathematics department of the University of Turin, the place where Peano developed his teaching and research.\nSince De Latino Sine Flexione had set the principle to take Latin nouns either in the ablative or nominative form (nomen was preferred to nomine), in 1909 Peano published a vocabulary in order to assist in selecting the proper form of every noun, yet an essential value of Peano's Interlingua was that the lexicon might be found straightforward in any Latin dictionary (by getting the thematic vowel of the stem from the genitive ending, that is: -a -o -e -u -e from -ae -i -is -us -ei).\nFinally, a large vocabulary with 14,000 words was published in 1915.A reformed Interlingua was presented in 1951 by Alexander Gode as the last director of the International Auxiliary Language Association. It was claimed to be independent from Peano's Interlingua, because it had developed a new method to detect the most recent common prototypes. But that method usually leads to the Latin ablative, so most vocabulary of Peano's Interlingua would be kept. Accordingly, the very name Interlingua was kept, yet a distinct abbreviation was adopted: IA instead of IL.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_6711", "text": "Iton 77 (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05df 77) is an Israeli monthly literature and culture magazine published in Israel.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27392", "text": "Writing Drama (French: La dramaturgie) is a treatise by French writer and filmmaker Yves Lavandier, originally published in 1994, revised in 1997, 2004, 2008, 2011 and 2014.

In 1923 Aftenposten adopted the Norwegian spelling standard of 1907, which mainly replaced the \"soft\" consonants (e.g. d, b) characteristic of Danish pronunciation (but also used in some Norwegian dialects) with \"hard\" consonants (e.g. t, p) characteristic of Eastern Central Norwegian pronunciation, but which was otherwise mostly identical with Danish.  In 1928 Aftenposten adopted the most conservative variant of the spelling standard of 1917, which is largely similar to the \"moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" or \"Riksm\u00e5l\" standard used today.\nDuring the Norwegian language struggle from the early 1950s, Aftenposten was the main newspaper of the Riksm\u00e5l variety of Norwegian, and maintained close ties to the Riksm\u00e5l movement's institutions, recognising the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature as the sole authoritative body for regulating the Norwegian language as used by the newspaper. Due to its status as the country's largest and most influential newspaper, Aftenposten therefore had a significant influence on the developments that took place during the Norwegian language struggle. The \"moderate\" or \"conservative\" Riksm\u00e5l language used by Aftenposten was mainly associated with a conservative stance in Norwegian politics, and was contrasted with the \"radical\" Samnorsk language, an attempt to merge Bokm\u00e5l with Nynorsk which was promoted by socialist governments in the 1950s. By 1960 it had become apparent that the Samnorsk attempt had failed, and as a result, Aftenposten's Riksm\u00e5l standard and the government-promoted Bokm\u00e5l standard have in the following decades become almost identical as the Bokm\u00e5l standard has incorporated nearly all of Riksm\u00e5l. As a consequence, Aftenposten decided to describe its language as \"Moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" from 2006, and published its own dictionary, based on Riksm\u00e5l and Moderate Bokm\u00e5l, but excluding \"radical\" (i.e. similar to Nynorsk) variants of Bokm\u00e5l.\nThe online version of the paper for some years during the early 2000s had an English section.

In 1923 Aftenposten adopted the Norwegian spelling standard of 1907, which mainly replaced the \"soft\" consonants (e.g. d, b) characteristic of Danish pronunciation (but also used in some Norwegian dialects) with \"hard\" consonants (e.g. t, p) characteristic of Eastern Central Norwegian pronunciation, but which was otherwise mostly identical with Danish.  In 1928 Aftenposten adopted the most conservative variant of the spelling standard of 1917, which is largely similar to the \"moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" or \"Riksm\u00e5l\" standard used today.\nDuring the Norwegian language struggle from the early 1950s, Aftenposten was the main newspaper of the Riksm\u00e5l variety of Norwegian, and maintained close ties to the Riksm\u00e5l movement's institutions, recognising the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature as the sole authoritative body for regulating the Norwegian language as used by the newspaper. Due to its status as the country's largest and most influential newspaper, Aftenposten therefore had a significant influence on the developments that took place during the Norwegian language struggle. The \"moderate\" or \"conservative\" Riksm\u00e5l language used by Aftenposten was mainly associated with a conservative stance in Norwegian politics, and was contrasted with the \"radical\" Samnorsk language, an attempt to merge Bokm\u00e5l with Nynorsk which was promoted by socialist governments in the 1950s. By 1960 it had become apparent that the Samnorsk attempt had failed, and as a result, Aftenposten's Riksm\u00e5l standard and the government-promoted Bokm\u00e5l standard have in the following decades become almost identical as the Bokm\u00e5l standard has incorporated nearly all of Riksm\u00e5l. As a consequence, Aftenposten decided to describe its language as \"Moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" from 2006, and published its own dictionary, based on Riksm\u00e5l and Moderate Bokm\u00e5l, but excluding \"radical\" (i.e. similar to Nynorsk) variants of Bokm\u00e5l.\nThe online version of the paper for some years during the early 2000s had an English section.

The band, initially called Roundabout, was the idea of former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis, who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore before leaving the project. The Mk. I line-up of the band was completed by vocalist/frontman Rod Evans, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice, in March 1968.\nAfter about two months of rehearsals, Shades of Deep Purple was recorded in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic. Stylistically, the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s.\nThe album was not well received in the UK, where it sold very few copies and did not chart. In the US, on the other hand, it was a success and the single \"Hush\", an energetic rock track written by Joe South and originally recorded by Billy Joe Royal, became very popular at the time, reaching number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The good sales of the album and the intense radio play of the single contributed largely to the attention Deep Purple would get in their early US tours and also during the 1970s.

They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, but their musical approach has changed over the years. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album Deep Purple in Rock. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies\". They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide.Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and were broken up for eight years from 1976 to 1984, with drummer Ian Paice being the band's only constant member. The first four line-ups, which constituted the band's original 1968\u20131976 run, are officially indicated as Mark I (1968\u20131969), Mark II (1969\u20131973), Mark III (1973\u20131975) and Mark IV (1975\u20131976). Mark I comprised the founding members of Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Rod Evans (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards), Paice (drums) and Nick Simper (bass), while Mark II was the most commercially successful line-up, with Ian Gillan and Roger Glover replacing Evans and Simper respectively. Mark III saw David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes replace Gillan and Glover respectively, while Mark IV featured Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore. The band split in July 1976, and Bolin died from a drug overdose five months later. Deep Purple reformed in 1984 with the Mark II line-up, which remained in place until Joe Lynn Turner replaced Gillan in 1989. Gillan rejoined in 1992, with Blackmore leaving for the second and final time the following year. He was replaced temporarily by Joe Satriani and then permanently by Steve Morse. In 2002, Lord retired and was replaced by Don Airey, which saw Deep Purple settle into its longest running line-up, unchanged for the next twenty years, until Morse announced his departure from the band in 2022. His place was taken by Simon McBride. Paice, Glover, Gillan, Airey and McBride comprise the current line-up of Deep Purple.\nDeep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme, and a poll on radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the \"most influential bands ever\".

They were also criticised for being too American and the \"poor man's Vanilla Fudge\". As Brian Connolly of Sweet recalled, \"they were so out of place that you really felt sorry for them.\"By contrast, in the US the band was often introduced as \"the English Vanilla Fudge\" and massive radio coverage of their songs granted success for both the album and tour. Ian Paice said of their success in the US versus their lack of it back home, \"We have been given proper exposure over there. The Americans really know how to push records.\"Decades later, modern critical reviews of the album are generally positive. Bruce Eder of AllMusic considers Shades of Deep Purple, despite some flaws, \"a hell of an album\" and praises the \"infectious ... spirit of fun\" of the disc, which has \"much more of a '60s feel than we're accustomed to hearing from this band\". Blogcritics contributor David Bowling states that Shades of Deep Purple \"was a creative and very good debut album\", which combines \"psychedelic music with hard rock and early progressive rock into a pleasant but disjointed whole\". PopMatters review of the three albums of the Mk. I line-up considers them \"both respectable and consistent\", although Evans' voice is \"perhaps more suited to heavy pop rather than heavy rock\". Canadian journalist Martin Popoff described this early incarnation of Deep Purple as a \"hard psych band\", more committed to the music than other contemporaries and already capable of creating \"a noise that definitetly foretold of things to come.\"In an Observer Music Monthly Greatest British Albums poll, keyboard player Rick Wakeman chose Shades of Deep Purple as his favourite British record of all time.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The name is currently popular among the people of Generations X and Generation Y. The name itself peaked in popularity at #3, in 1975.Heather, though a name found primarily in English speaking countries, has other variants simply because of its definition as a flowering plant. However its foreign names often closely resemble other words with meanings so is difficult to distinguish a given variant's origin as arising from the flower, or from that of another word. For example, the name Heidi in German resembles Heidekraut, which is the German word for the Heather shrubs, though the name Heidi is usually thought to mean \"of noble birth\" (a diminutive of the name Adelheid).  The 1988 dark comedy film, Heathers, satirized the name by associating it with \"in-crowd\" cliques of teen-age high school girls.\nThe name Erica actually has two meanings, one of which is related to the Heather plant whose Latin name is Ericaceae.

But evidence, both internal and external, support Adler's interpretation: the upended rocks do appear to crush the ship, and the depicted rock formations and Watkins Glen, referred to by Dickinson in discussing the picture's man-made structures, both pertain to his native region of western New York state, as does the trapped weasel, based on one he had found in a glen in Sheldrake.  And neither these, nor the falling rocks are connected with the supposed topic of his painting (described in a letter of 1934 as the \"stranding of Dr. Kane's brig 'Advance' on the Greenland coast\"). Rather, the ruined state of the walkways and stairs and the upended terrain, like the trapped weasel and the crushed ship and whaleboat reinforce the idea of a situation without escape that leaves him feeling trapped and crushed, with the ground collapsing and rocks falling from above. \nBiographical events may also have contributed to Dickinson's feelings: he had a bout with ulcers in 1933; he experienced back pains bad enough to wear a back brace from June 1931 until after Stranded Brig was complete; and on July 1, 1934 he entered the hospital for a battery of tests. The tests were inconclusive, but Dickinson's daughter believes the real problem was depression, a family problem that had led to the death of his older brother, Burgess, in 1913  and was perhaps exacerbated by his still-unresolved struggle with Woodland Scene, on which he had at that time spent five and a half years. When Dickinson's brother Burgess jumped to his death, his eldest brother Howard told the press that Burgess often became depressed when he felt that his work hadn't achieved the level of excellence he set for himself,  and Dickinson, who called his brother \"the chief influence in my entire life\", may well have felt the same way. Indeed, his reported comments about Stranded Brig, probably in the fall or winter of 1932,  before it was reworked for the PWAP, indicate the pressure he felt to do justice not only to this picture but to the unfinished Woodland Scene, which was becoming more difficult to finish than he had expected.  According to Provincetown painter Bruce McKain, Dickinson had shown him the picture of boats in ice, told him that it was not finished and he wouldn't finish it without doing \"justice to the way it should be.

The lyrics are darker than his previous releases, exploring themes of insanity, religion, technology and war. None of its songs were released as singles; some tracks appeared as B-sides between 1970 and 1973. Originally titled Metrobolist, a play on the film Metropolis (1927), the title was changed at the last minute by Mercury without Bowie's consultation.\nThe album was released with different cover artwork in the US and the UK. For the US release, the artwork was a cartoon-like drawing by Michael J. Weller of a cowboy in front of an asylum. The UK cover by Keith MacMillan features Bowie wearing a Michael Fish-designed blue dress. A 1972 reissue by RCA Records featured a black-and-white picture of Bowie's then-current character Ziggy Stardust; reissues since 1990 have revived the original UK artwork.\nThe Man Who Sold the World was originally better received by music critics in the US than in the UK.

Bowie was initially aggravated that Mercury had retitled the album from his preferred title of Metrobolist without his consultation, but following its release in the US, Bowie attempted to persuade the label to retitle the album Holy Holy after his newly released single of the same name.

In 1923 Aftenposten adopted the Norwegian spelling standard of 1907, which mainly replaced the \"soft\" consonants (e.g. d, b) characteristic of Danish pronunciation (but also used in some Norwegian dialects) with \"hard\" consonants (e.g. t, p) characteristic of Eastern Central Norwegian pronunciation, but which was otherwise mostly identical with Danish.

Due to its status as the country's largest and most influential newspaper, Aftenposten therefore had a significant influence on the developments that took place during the Norwegian language struggle. The \"moderate\" or \"conservative\" Riksm\u00e5l language used by Aftenposten was mainly associated with a conservative stance in Norwegian politics, and was contrasted with the \"radical\" Samnorsk language, an attempt to merge Bokm\u00e5l with Nynorsk which was promoted by socialist governments in the 1950s. By 1960 it had become apparent that the Samnorsk attempt had failed, and as a result, Aftenposten's Riksm\u00e5l standard and the government-promoted Bokm\u00e5l standard have in the following decades become almost identical as the Bokm\u00e5l standard has incorporated nearly all of Riksm\u00e5l. As a consequence, Aftenposten decided to describe its language as \"Moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" from 2006, and published its own dictionary, based on Riksm\u00e5l and Moderate Bokm\u00e5l, but excluding \"radical\" (i.e. similar to Nynorsk) variants of Bokm\u00e5l.\nThe online version of the paper for some years during the early 2000s had an English section.

The volume in which it appeared also contained the poet's closet drama Samson Agonistes. Paradise Regained is connected by name to his earlier and more famous epic poem Paradise Lost, with which it shares similar theological themes; indeed, its title, its use of blank verse, and its progression through Christian history recall the earlier work. However, this effort deals primarily with the temptation of Christ as recounted in the Gospel of Luke.\nMilton composed Paradise Regained at his cottage in Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire. Paradise Regained is four books long and comprises 2,065 lines; in contrast, Paradise Lost is twelve books long and comprises 10,565 lines. As such, Barbara K. Lewalski has labelled the work a \"brief epic\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26301", "text": "Whereas Paradise Lost is ornate in style and decorative in its verse, Paradise Regained is carried out in a fairly plain style. Specifically, Milton reduces his use of simile and deploys a simpler syntax in Paradise Regained than he does in Paradise Lost, and this is consistent with Biblical descriptions of Jesus's plainness in his life and teachings (in the epic, he prefers Hebrew Psalms to Greek poetry). Modern editors believe the simpler style of Paradise Regained evinces Milton's poetic maturity. This is not to say that the poem bears no affinities with Milton's earlier work, but scholars continue to agree with Northrop Frye's suggestion that Paradise Regained is \"practically sui generis\" in its poetic execution.\nOne major concept emphasized throughout Paradise Regained is the idea of reversals. As implied by its title, Milton sets out to reverse the \"loss\" of Paradise. Thus, antonyms are often found next to each other, reinforcing the idea that everything that was lost in the first epic will be regained by the end of this \"brief epic\". Additionally, the work focuses on the idea of \"hunger\", both in a literal and in a spiritual sense. After wandering in the wilderness for forty days, Jesus is starving for food. Satan, too blind to see any non-literal meanings of the term, offers Christ food and various other temptations, but Jesus continually denies him. Although Milton's Jesus is remarkably human, an exclusive focus on this dimension of his character obscures the divine stakes of Jesus's confrontation with Satan; Jesus emerges victorious, and Satan falls, amazed.\nAn anecdote recounted by a Quaker named Thomas Ellwood provides some insight into Paradise Regained's development. After studying Latin with Milton and reading the poet's epic Paradise Lost, Ellwood remarked, \"Thou hast said much here of Paradise lost, but what hast thou to say of Paradise found?\" Hearing this, Milton at first \"sat some time in a muse\" before changing the subject; however, sometime thereafter he showed to Ellwood a new manuscript entitled Paradise Regained. Some maintain that although he seemed to express gratitude to Ellwood in a letter, Milton in truth \"passed on a friendly if impish fabrication\" that made Ellwood feel like the inspiration for the poem.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "495_61740", "text": "\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_6937", "text": "A man dies and goes to heaven, escaping the predicament of the modern civilisation.

Writer and reporter Wojciech Jagielski has been a member of the international department since 2017.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6953", "text": "Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha helped found the weekly magazine Tygodnik Powszechny, whose first edition was published on 24 March 1945, during the closing months of World War II. Initially, its editorial staff had four people: Jan Piwowarczyk, a priest; Jerzy Turowicz, editor-in-chief for many years; Konstanty Turowski and Maria Czapska. Later, they were joined by Zofia Starowieyska\u2013Morstinowa, Stefan Kisielewski, Leopold Tyrmand, Antoni Go\u0142ubiew, Pawe\u0142 Jasienica (until he was arrested by the communists in 1948), Stanis\u0142aw Stomma, Hanna Malewska and J\u00f3zefa Golmont\u2013Hennelowa.\nIn 1953, the weekly was suspended and lost its printing house after it had refused to print the obituary of Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. From 1953 to 1956, it was published by new editors, representing the pro-government PAX Association and was informally known as Tygodnik Paxowski. The same format was used and numbering was continuous during that period although none of the previous editors still worked for the paper.\nAfter the 1956 Polish October, the \"Thaw\" allowed the original editors were able to resume control of the magazine in December. Columnists have included prominent clerics, such as Karol Wojty\u0142a (later Pope John Paul II), academics and poets, journalists and other writers, including W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski, Jerzy Zawieyski, Jacek Wo\u017aniakowski, Stefan Wilkanowicz, Adam Szostkiewicz, Leszek Ko\u0142akowski, Stanis\u0142aw Lem, Zbigniew Herbert, Wojciech Karpi\u0144ski, Tadeusz Kudli\u0144ski and Czes\u0142aw Zgorzelski.\nCzes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz published his poems in Tygodnik Powszechny for many years. In 1945, he prepared a handwritten volume of poems, Wiersze p\u00f3\u0142-perskie, for Jerzy Turowicz, the editor. Forced into exile to the United States, Mi\u0142osz continued to publish in the magazine. After he received the Nobel Prize, it was the only magazine in which Mi\u0142osz published his poems.\nIn the late 1950s, the newspaper became affiliated with the officially recognized political party Znak, which was newly organized in the wake of the \"Thaw\". When Znak helped establish the Solidarity movement, Father J\u00f3zef Tischner, one of the writers of the Krakov edition, became its chaplain.\nAfter martial law was declared, the magazine suspended its publication for several months. Since 1982, Tygodnik Powszechny has been published continuously.\nAfter Wojty\u0142a was elected as Pope John Paul II, Tygodnik Powszechny became the most popular vehicle for his teachings in Poland. For a long time, it was the only magazine in the world to have gained an interview with the new pope, which was published 3 August 1980.\nIn the 1980s, the magazine informally represented the Polish democratic opposition. It was sometimes regarded as the only legal oppositional magazine in the People's Republic of Poland (PRL). In 1987, it published a controversial essay by Jan B\u0142o\u0144ski, \"The Poor Poles Look at the Ghetto\" (\"Biedni Polacy patrz\u0105 na getto\"), which explored the historic relations between Catholic and Jewish Poles, and the experiences of the Holocaust during World War II.\nSince the 1990s, part of the church hierarchy has criticized Tygodnik Powszechny for what is considered to be its overly-liberal outlook. That does not reflect the parochial distribution of the magazine.\nIn 1998, Maria Zmarz-Koczanowicz produced the documentary Ordinary Kindness (Zwyczajna dobro\u0107), which told the story of Turowicz.\nIn 1999, after the death of Turowicz, the chief editor became Father Adam Boniecki.\nIn April 2007, the ITI Group purchased 49% of the magazine. Since 5 December 2007, Tygodnik Powszechny has been published in a smaller size.

After 1989, Tygodnik Powszechny was believed to represent only one political party, the Democratic Union, which was later transformed into the Freedom Union. Many people involved in the magazine participated in the political changes of the era (J\u00f3zefa Hennelowa, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Krzysztof Koz\u0142owski).\nThe critics of the Cracow weekly magazine often quote the letter written by John Paul II on 15 May 1995, on the occasion of the magazine's 50th anniversary: \n\nThe year 1989 brought Poland deep changes connected with the downfall of the communist system.

The point was to erase from the memory of citizens what was the role of the Church in the nation within the space of the last years. Accusations and slanders about clericalism were multiplying as well as those about the alleged intention of the Church to rule Poland and about hindering political emancipation in the Polish society. Forgive me, if I say that those influences were also visible in Tygodnik Powszechny.

The only extant member of the Oghuric group that is still spoken today is the Chuvash language. The language persisted in the Volga region up until the 13th or 14th century. Although there is no direct evidence, some scholars believe it gave rise to modern Chuvash language while others support the idea Chuvash is an another distinct Oghur Turkic language.Italian historian and philologist Igor de Rachewiltz noted a significant distinction of the Chuvash language from other Turkic languages. According to him, the Chuvash language does not share certain common characteristics with Turkic languages to such a degree that some scholars consider Chuvash as an independent branch from Turkic and Mongolic. The Turkic classification of Chuvash was seen as a compromise solution for classification purposes.Definition of verbs in Volga Bulgar\nVolga Bulgars left some inscriptions in tombstones. There are few surviving inscriptions in the Volga Bulgar language, as the language was primarily an oral language and the Volga Bulgars did not develop a writing system until much later in their history. After converting to Islam, some of these inscriptions were written using Arabic letters while the use of the Orkhon script continued. Mahmud al-Kashgari provides some information about the language of the Volga Bulgars, whom he refers to as Bulghars. Some scholars suggest Hunnic had strong ties with Bulgar and to modern Chuvash and classify this grouping as separate Hunno-Bulgar languages. However, such speculations are not based on proper linguistic evidence, since the language of the Huns is almost unknown except for a few attested words and personal names. Scholars generally consider Hunnish as unclassifiable.Numbers and Vocabulary in Volga Bulgar\nMahmud al-Kashgari also provides some examples of Volga Bulgar words, poems, and phrases in his dictionary..

But a critic in the New York Herald Tribune wrote that \"[f]or all its enthusiasm there is no impact to thought or phrase, the emotion is meager, the imagination bridled.\"In April 1927 they founded an English-language publishing company that they first named \u00c9ditions Narcisse, after their black whippet, Narcisse Noir. They used the press as an avenue to publish their own poetry in small editions of finely-made, hard-bound volumes. Their first effort was Caresse's Painted Shores, in which she wrote about their relationship, including their reconciliation after one of Harry's affairs. Her writing matured somewhat, and the book was more creatively organized than her prior efforts. In 1928 she wrote an epic poem which was published as The Stranger. The writing is addressed to the men in her life: her father, husband, and son. In an experimental fashion she explored the various kinds of love she had known. Later that year, Impossible Melodies explored similar themes. The Crosbys enjoyed such a positive reception of their initial work and decided to expand the press to serve other authors.Publishing in Paris during the 1920s and 1930s put the company in the milieu of so many American writers who were living abroad. In 1928, \u00c9ditions Narcisse published a limited edition of 300 numbered copies of \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" by Edgar Allan Poe with illustrations by Alastair.In 1928, Harry and Caresse changed the name of the publishing house to the Black Sun Press, in keeping with Harry's fascination with death and the symbolism of the sun.:\u200a42\u200a Harry developed a private mythology around the sun as a symbol for both life and death, creation, and destruction. The press rapidly gained notice for publishing beautifully bound, typographically flawless editions of unusual books. They took exquisite care with the books they published, choosing the finest papers and inks.\nThey published early works of a number of avant-garde writers before those writers were well-known, including James Joyce's Tales Told of Shem and Shaun, which was later integrated into Finnegans Wake. They published Kay Boyle's first book-length work, Short Stories, in 1929, and works by Hart Crane, Ernest Hemingway, Eugene Jolas, D. H. Lawrence, Archibald MacLeish, Ezra Pound, and Laurence Sterne. The Black Sun Press evolved into one of the most important small presses in Paris in the 1920s. In 1929, Caresse and Harry both signed poet Eugene Jolas' The Revolution of the Word Proclamation, which appeared in issue 16/17 of the literary journal transition.

Experimenting with poetry drew high praise from France's greatest literary critic, Nicolas Boileau, with whom Racine would later become great friends; Boileau would often claim that he was behind the budding poet's work. Racine eventually took up residence in Paris where he became involved in theatrical circles.\nHis first play, Amasie, never reached the stage. On 20 June 1664, Racine's tragedy La Th\u00e9ba\u00efde ou les fr\u00e8res ennemis (The Thebans or the enemy Brothers) was produced by Moli\u00e8re's troupe at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Palais-Royal, in Paris. The following year, Moli\u00e8re also put on Racine's second play, Alexandre le Grand. However, this play garnered such good feedback from the public that Racine secretly negotiated with a rival play company, the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne, to perform the play \u2013 since they had a better reputation for performing tragedies. Thus, Alexandre premiered for the second time, by a different acting troupe, eleven days after its first showing. Moli\u00e8re could never forgive Racine for this betrayal, and Racine simply widened the rift between him and his former friend by seducing Moli\u00e8re's leading actress, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se du Parc, into becoming his companion both professionally and personally. From this point on the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne troupe performed all of Racine's secular plays.\nThough both La Th\u00e9ba\u00efde (1664) and its successor, Alexandre (1665), had classical themes, Racine was already entering into controversy and forced to field accusations that he was polluting the minds of his audiences. He broke all ties with Port-Royal, and proceeded with Andromaque (1667), which told the story of Andromache, widow of Hector, and her fate following the Trojan War. Amongst his rivals were Pierre Corneille and his brother, Thomas Corneille. Tragedians often competed with alternative versions of the same plot: for example, Michel le Clerc produced an Iphig\u00e9nie in the same year as Racine (1674), and Jacques Pradon also wrote a play about Ph\u00e8dre (1677). The success of Pradon's work (the result of the activities of a claque) was one of the events which caused Racine to renounce his work as a dramatist at that time, even though his career up to this point was so successful that he was the first French author to live almost entirely on the money he earned from his writings. Others, including the historian Warren Lewis, attribute his retirement from the theater to qualms of conscience.\nHowever, one major incident which seems to have contributed to Racine's departure from public life was his implication in a court scandal of 1679. He got married at about this time to the pious Catherine de Romanet, and his religious beliefs and devotion to the Jansenist sect were revived. He and his wife eventually had two sons and five daughters. Around the time of his marriage and departure from the theatre, Racine accepted a position as a royal historiographer in the court of King Louis XIV, alongside his friend Boileau. He kept this position in spite of the minor scandals he was involved in. In 1672, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, eventually gaining much power over this organisation. Two years later, he was given the title of \"treasurer of France\", and he was later distinguished as an \"ordinary gentleman of the king\" (1690), and then as a secretary of the king (1696). Because of Racine's flourishing career in the court, Louis XIV provided for his widow and children after his death. When at last he returned to the theatre, it was at the request of Madame de Maintenon, morganatic second wife of King Louis XIV, with the moral fables, Esther (1689) and Athalie (1691), both of which were based on Old Testament stories and intended for performance by the pupils of the school of the Maison royale de Saint-Louis in Saint-Cyr (a commune neighboring Versailles, and now known as \"Saint-Cyr l'\u00c9cole\").\nJean Racine died in 1699 from cancer of the liver. He requested burial in Port-Royal, but after Louis XIV had this site razed in 1710, his remains were moved to the Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont church in Paris.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The musicians included John Sebastian, Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, Jesse Ed Davis, and Miguel Ferrer playing drums. Kaylan described the album as \"a fantasy record for him\", allowing him to live out his fantasy to \"be a Beach Boy\". For this reason, Moon largely avoided playing the drums, as he considered drumming his \"job\". Moon left Los Angeles on 19 April to begin filming Tommy, and after the filming concluded, unofficially relocated to California in August 1974, to work on the studio album.The album would be funded by a recording contract directly with Los Angeles' MCA Records arranged by Bill Curbishley and Peter Rudge. Funding was unavailable from London due to Track Records' legal problems with former Who managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, and Moon's extravagant spending habits made labels reluctant to fund the sessions. Biographer Tony Fletcher expresses astonishment that MCA approved the album's recording and released the \"travesty of a Beach Boys cover\" as a single rather than rejecting the master tapes for \"Don't Worry Baby\".The sessions for Two Sides of the Moon were affected by the \"lazy and decadent self-indulgence\" of mid-1970s Los Angeles' \"superstar scene\". Inconsistent working hours and substance abuse slowed down the sessions considerably. The atmosphere of the studio resembled that of a club. Engineer Gary Ladinsky recalled: \"You'd get something done for an hour, and then it's a party scene. Eventually, you clear out the studio and you might do something for another half an hour, and then people wander out, and you realise, 'I guess the session is over.'\"After \"Teenage Idol\", with Dick Dale guesting on guitar, was delivered to MCA, Evans was fired. Fletcher attributes this to Moon's realisation that the sessions were largely fruitless and Evans' own drinking problem was worsening. Skip Taylor replaced him as producer. Volman and engineer John Stronach described Taylor as the main provider of drugs for the sessions. Taylor did not dispute the assessment: \"I would go in and decide, is this a night where we should have a little brandy, or should we smoke some stuff, or should we put a couple of lines out?\"Most of the musicians involved saw no real difference as a result of the change. Kaylan commented that after recording his parts twice, \"Basically it was the same record.\" Joe Walsh, then recording So What with Stronach at the Record Plant, was brought in to play additional guitar on \"The Kids Are Alright\" late in the sessions. He described the results as \"semi-train wrecks\" and expressed surprise that Moon had only used two producers since he would \"fry\" anyone who worked with him.Moon's contributions to the album were primarily vocals. He only played drums on three songs, simultaneously accompanied by session drummers. Stronach said that the sessions had two drummers: \"One to keep time and then Keith to play over it.\" The first set of vocals recorded with Evans, done while Moon was drunk, was discarded. Taylor characterised them as \"a guy from England trying to sound like a guy from Nashville but having about five belts before he did it.\" Taylor demanded that Moon abandon the country twang in which he had sung the early songs (and which is noticeable on outtakes such as \"I'm Not Angry\"), and sing in the posh British accent he regularly mimicked.Fletcher comments that so many musicians were brought in to try to \"salvage\" the record (sixty being credited on the final album, with several others such as Brian Wilson having been rumoured to have contributed as well) that it resulted in Moon sounding more like \"the guest on someone else's record\".Moon's behaviour during the sessions reflected his self-destructive lifestyle and worsening health. Stronach recalled, \"He'd come in, reach into his pockets, and there'd be pills and cocaine falling out.\" Moon had previously been able to sing adequately on several songs from the A Quick One (1966), Ready Steady Who (1966), The Who Sell Out (1967) and Quadrophenia (1973) sessions. His strained and frequently off-key vocals on Two Sides of the Moon contributed to feelings of inadequacy and depression throughout recording. Recording vocals one night in Studio B under a low ceiling covered in spotlights, he smashed a light bulb with an ashtray every time recording was stopped because he failed to hit a note. He ended up destroying the entire light fixture.MCA's then-president Mike Maitland told Taylor at their first meeting that a lot of money had been invested before he assumed production duties, and that MCA was \"prepared to spend an enormous sum of money in promotion and marketing\". This was exactly what happened: Fletcher states that \"well over $200,000\" was spent for \"recording costs alone\", and that Moon claimed to receive a non-returnable advance for the same amount.With the album being prepared for release in 1975, MCA initially refused to pay for the elaborate sleeve designed by Gary Stromberg. Moon, Taylor and Stronach went to meet with Maitland. Moon asked Taylor to stop in front of an Army and Navy store on the way, and returned with a fire axe, which he kept hidden on himself. Maitland once again denied their sleeve request, criticising them for the excessive cost of the album. Moon responded by placing himself directly in front of Maitland and held the fire axe above Maitland's mahogany partners desk, and said, \"What's it going to be, dear boy?

Lovecraft, and Dennis Wheatley.\" He characterises side two as \"given over to loose blues-rock jamming learned through\" the English rock band Cream.In the opinion of the author and former Metal Maniacs magazine editor Jeff Wagner, Black Sabbath is the \"generally accepted starting point\" when heavy metal \"became distinct from rock and roll\". In his opinion, the album represented a transition from blues rock into \"something uglier\", and that this sound \"found deeper gravity via mournful singing and a sinister rhythmic pulse\". According to Rolling Stone magazine, \"the album that arguably invented heavy metal was built on thunderous blues-rock\".

Engineer Robin Black had worked with the band in the mid-1970s on Sabotage and received a co-producer credit on Born Again.\nDuring recording, the band members lived at Manor Studio while Gillan chose to live outside the house, alone, in a marquee tent on the studio grounds: \"I thought he was joking, but when I arrived at the Manor I saw this marquee outside and I thought, fucking hell, he's serious. Ian had put up this big, huge tent. It had a cooking area and a bedroom and whatever else\", said Iommi. Butler said that the tent situation and Gillan's refusal to live with his new bandmates, in hindsight, likely indicated that the vocalist didn't view himself as a member of the band.\"Ian's lyrics were about sexual things or true facts, even about stuff that happened at The Manor there and then,\" Iommi said. \"They were good, but quite a departure from Geezer's and Ronnie's lyrics.\" For example, Gillan returned from a local pub one evening, took a car belonging to drummer Ward, and commenced racing around a go-cart track on the Manor Studio property. He crashed the car, which burst into flames after he escaped uninjured. He wrote the album's opening \"Trashed\" about the experience. Butler felt that Gillan's lyrics on tracks such as \"Digital Bitch\" and \"Keep It Warm\" were good, but much better suited to the musical style of Deep Purple than Black Sabbath.\"Disturbing the Priest\" was written after a rehearsal space \u2013 set up by Iommi in a small building near a local church \u2013 received noise complaints from the resident priests. \"We wanted this effect on 'Disturbing the Priest',\" recalled the guitarist, \"and Bill got this big bucket of water and he got this anvil. It was really heavy, and he'd got it hanging on a piece of rope and lower it in to get this effect: hit it and lower it in, and then lift it out again. It was a great effect, but it took hours to do.\"The band got along well, but it became apparent to all involved that Gillan's style did not quite mesh with the Sabbath sound. In 1992, he told director Martin Baker, \"I was the worst singer Black Sabbath ever had. It was totally, totally incompatible with any music they'd ever done. I didn't wear leathers, I wasn't of that image...I think the fans probably were in a total state of confusion.\" In 1992, Iommi admitted to Guitar World, \"Ian is a great singer, but he's from a completely different background, and it was difficult for him to come in and sing Sabbath material.\"\n\"I saw Ian go into the studio one day,\" Ward recalled, \"and I was fortunate and honoured, actually, to be part of a session. I watched him lay tracks on 'Keep It Warm'\u2026 I felt like Ian was Ian in that song\u2026 I watched this incredible transformation of this man that really, I felt, delicately put lyrics together. It made sense. I thought he did an excellent job. And I really dig that song too.\"\"I did some of the best drum work on that album\u2026\" Bill Ward recalled. \"On 'Disturbing the Priest', there were some polyrhythms and some counterpoint things that I was doing, and I was using at least twenty different pieces of percussion towards the end of that song\u2026 I was real proud of a lot of the work that I did. Some of it invariably got lost in the mix, but I know that it's printed on those tracks.\" Butler said that Ward began acting quite strangely during recording and was angrier than he had ever seen him. At one point the drummer began hallucinating and had to be hospitalized, and while he was there the band discovered his secret stash of vodka that he'd been consuming in secret at night. After being released from the hospital, Ward quit the band again and returned to America to sort out his issues, with his drum parts already recorded.When the band heard the final product, they were horrified at the muffled mix. In his autobiography, Iommi explains that Gillan inadvertently blew a couple of tweeters in the studio speakers by playing the backing tracks too loud and nobody noticed. \"We just thought it was a bit of a funny sound, but it went very wrong somewhere between the mix and the mastering and the pressing of that album...the sound was really dull and muffly. I didn't know about it, because we were already out on tour in Europe. By the time we heard the album, it was out and in the charts, but the sound was awful.\" Butler recalled listening to the tapes in his hotel room and being alarmed at how \"muffled and unclear\" the tracks were, but Iommi and Black assured him that the issue would be corrected during mixing. Ultimately, the issue never was corrected, with Butler lamenting years later that \"that's what happens when you don't hire a bona fide producer, like Martin Birch, to handle things.\"For all his misgivings, Gillan remembers the period fondly, stating in the Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992 documentary, \"But by God, we had a good year...And the songs, I think, were quite good.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41335", "text": "The track \"Black Sabbath Medley\" is a CD bonus track and is composed of parts of songs from Black Sabbath, namely: \"Symptom of the Universe\", \"Sweet Leaf\", \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\", \"Into the Void\", \"Electric Funeral\", \"Supernaut\", \"Black Sabbath\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Sundanese Standard Sundanese There are two types of Sundanese used. First, the Priangan Sundanese or new phase Sundanese, which is used by the people in the Gantar sub-district and parts of Haurgeulis (bordering the Subang district), the southern Terisi District (which borders Majalengka and Sumedang Regencies), and the Karangjaya block in Mangunjaya village in Anjatan District. Sundanese Indramayu - there is also the original Sundanese Indramayu phase in the Indramayu Regency, namely in Ilir, Bulak, and Parean Girang villages in Kandanghaur District, and Lelea and Tamansari villages in Lelea District. The Sundanese phase of Old Sundanese is somewhat different from the new Sundanese phase due to temporal dialect differences. The most obvious difference is that in the ancient Sundanese language, there were no undak-usuk (levels of language). Old Sundanese also did not recognize the vowel /eu/, but only /e/. Not to mention the difference in vocabulary. Javanese There are currently three dialects of Javanese in Indramayu Regency. The majority are Dermayu dialects (Indramayu). But there is also a Javanese dialect of Cerbon (Cirebon), namely in Krangkeng Village, Kalianyar, and around it in Krangkeng District, which borders Cirebon Regency. The Tegal-Brebes dialect of Javanese language also exists in the western region of Indramayu Regency because in the 1920s there was migration from Tegal-Brebes to the region, namely in several villages or blocks in the Haurgeulis, Anjatan, Patrol, Sukra, and Bongas Districts. The Javanese language dialect Dermayu is mostly used by the people of Indramayu, who total about 1.894 million people in 2023. There are two levels in the Dermayu dialect of Javanese which is a social dialect (sociolect), namely the bagongan level or ngoko and the level of freedom or besiken or krama.

In 1923 Aftenposten adopted the Norwegian spelling standard of 1907, which mainly replaced the \"soft\" consonants (e.g. d, b) characteristic of Danish pronunciation (but also used in some Norwegian dialects) with \"hard\" consonants (e.g. t, p) characteristic of Eastern Central Norwegian pronunciation, but which was otherwise mostly identical with Danish.  In 1928 Aftenposten adopted the most conservative variant of the spelling standard of 1917, which is largely similar to the \"moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" or \"Riksm\u00e5l\" standard used today.\nDuring the Norwegian language struggle from the early 1950s, Aftenposten was the main newspaper of the Riksm\u00e5l variety of Norwegian, and maintained close ties to the Riksm\u00e5l movement's institutions, recognising the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature as the sole authoritative body for regulating the Norwegian language as used by the newspaper. Due to its status as the country's largest and most influential newspaper, Aftenposten therefore had a significant influence on the developments that took place during the Norwegian language struggle. The \"moderate\" or \"conservative\" Riksm\u00e5l language used by Aftenposten was mainly associated with a conservative stance in Norwegian politics, and was contrasted with the \"radical\" Samnorsk language, an attempt to merge Bokm\u00e5l with Nynorsk which was promoted by socialist governments in the 1950s. By 1960 it had become apparent that the Samnorsk attempt had failed, and as a result, Aftenposten's Riksm\u00e5l standard and the government-promoted Bokm\u00e5l standard have in the following decades become almost identical as the Bokm\u00e5l standard has incorporated nearly all of Riksm\u00e5l. As a consequence, Aftenposten decided to describe its language as \"Moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" from 2006, and published its own dictionary, based on Riksm\u00e5l and Moderate Bokm\u00e5l, but excluding \"radical\" (i.e. similar to Nynorsk) variants of Bokm\u00e5l.\nThe online version of the paper for some years during the early 2000s had an English section.

He never had another theatrical success after Peer Gynt.In 1938, German composer Werner Egk finished an opera based on the story.\nIn 1948, the composer Harald S\u00e6verud made a new score for the nynorsk-production at \"the Norwegian Theatre\" (Det Norske Teatret) in Oslo. S\u00e6verud incorporated the national music of each of the friends in the fourth act, as per Ibsen's request, who died in 1906.\nIn 1951, North Carolinian playwright Paul Green published an American version of the Norwegian play. This is the version in which John Garfield starred on Broadway. This version is also the American Version, and features subtle plot differences from Ibsen's original work, including the omittance of the shipwreck scene near the end, and the Buttonmolder character playing a moderately larger role.In 1961, Hugh Leonard's version, The Passion of Peter Ginty, transferred the play to an Irish Civil War setting.  It was staged at Dublin's Gate Theatre.In 1969, Broadway impresario Jacques Levy (who had previously directed the first version of Oh! Calcutta!) commissioned The Byrds' Roger McGuinn to write the music for a pop (or country-rock) version of Peer Gynt, to be titled Gene Tryp. The play was apparently never completed, although, as of 2006, McGuinn was preparing a version for release. Several songs from the abortive show appeared on the Byrds' albums of 1970 and 1971.In March 1972 Jerry Heymann's adaptation, called Mr. Gynt, Inc., was performed at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club.In 1981, Houston Ballet presented Peer Gynt as adapted by Artistic Director Ben Stevenson, OBE.\nIn 1989, John Neumeier created a ballet \"freely based on Ibsen's play\", for which Alfred Schnittke composed the score.\nIn 1998, the Trinity Repertory Company of Providence, Rhode Island commissioned David Henry Hwang and Swiss director Stephan Muller to do an adaptation of Peer Gynt.\nIn 1998, playwright Romulus Linney directed his adaptation of the play, entitled Gint, at the Theatre for the New City in New York.  This adaptation moved the play's action to 20th-century Appalachia and California.\nIn 2001, Rogaland Theatre produced an adaptation entitled Peer Gynt-innen?, loosely translated as Peer the Gyntess?  This was a one-act monologue performed by Marika Enstad.In 2007, St. John's Prep of Danvers, Massachusetts won the MHSDG Festival with their production starring Bo Burnham.\nIn 2008, Theater in the Open in Newburyport, Massachusetts, produced a production of Peer Gynt adapted and directed by Paul Wann and the company.  Scott Smith, whose great, great grandfather (Ole Bull) was one of the inspirations for the character, was cast as Gynt.\nIn 2009, a DVD was released of Heinz Spoerli's ballet, which he had created in 2007. This ballet uses mostly the Grieg music, but adds selections by other composers. Spoken excerpts from the play, in Norwegian, are also included.In Israel, poet Dafna Eilat (he:\u05d3\u05e4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea) composed a poem in Hebrew called \"Solveig\", which she also set to music, its theme derived from the play and emphasizing the named character's boundless faithful love. It was performed by Hava Alberstein (see ).\nIn 2011, Polarity Ensemble Theatre in Chicago presented another version of Robert Bly's translation of the play, in which Peer's mythic journey was envisioned as that of America itself, \"a 150-year whirlwind tour of the American psyche.\"On an episode of Inside the Actors Studio, Elton John spontaneously composed a song based on a passage from Peer Gynt.\nThe German a cappella metal band Van Canto also made a theatrical adaptation of the story, naming it Peer Returns. The first episode that has been released called \"A Storm to Come\", appears on the band's album Break the Silence.\nAmerican composer Mary McCarty Snow (1928-2012) composed music for a Texas Tech University production of Peer Gynt.Will Eno's adaptation of Ibsen's Peer Gynt, titled Gnit, had its world premiere at the 37th Humana Festival of New American Plays in March 2013.In 2020, a new audio drama adaptation of Peer Gynt by Colin Macnee, written in verse form with original music, was released in podcast form.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "495_59673", "text": "The Circle (Swedish title Cirkeln) is a Swedish young adult fantasy novel written by Mats Strandberg and Sara Bergmark Elfgren.

Created by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887, it is intended to be a universal second language for international communication, or \"the international language\" (la Lingvo Internacia). Zamenhof first described the language in Dr. Esperanto's International Language (Esperanto: Unua Libro), which he published under the pseudonym Doktoro Esperanto. Early adopters of the language liked the name Esperanto and soon used it to describe his language. The word esperanto translates into English as \"one who hopes\".Within the range of constructed languages, Esperanto occupies a middle ground between \"naturalistic\" (imitating existing natural languages) and a priori (where features are not based on existing languages). Esperanto's vocabulary, syntax and semantics derive predominantly from languages of the Indo-European group. A substantial majority of its vocabulary (approximately 80%) derives from Romance languages, but it also contains elements derived from Germanic, Greek, and Slavic languages. One of the language's most notable features is its extensive system of derivation, where prefixes and suffixes may be freely combined with roots to generate words, making it possible to communicate effectively with a smaller set of words.\nEsperanto is the most successful constructed international auxiliary language, and the only such language with a sizeable population of native speakers, of which there are perhaps several thousand. Usage estimates are difficult, but two estimates put the number of people who know how to speak Esperanto at around 100,000. Concentration of speakers is highest in Europe, East Asia, and South America. Although no country has adopted Esperanto officially, Esperantujo (\"Esperanto-land\") is used as a name for the collection of places where it is spoken.

In 1923 Aftenposten adopted the Norwegian spelling standard of 1907, which mainly replaced the \"soft\" consonants (e.g. d, b) characteristic of Danish pronunciation (but also used in some Norwegian dialects) with \"hard\" consonants (e.g. t, p) characteristic of Eastern Central Norwegian pronunciation, but which was otherwise mostly identical with Danish.  In 1928 Aftenposten adopted the most conservative variant of the spelling standard of 1917, which is largely similar to the \"moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" or \"Riksm\u00e5l\" standard used today.\nDuring the Norwegian language struggle from the early 1950s, Aftenposten was the main newspaper of the Riksm\u00e5l variety of Norwegian, and maintained close ties to the Riksm\u00e5l movement's institutions, recognising the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature as the sole authoritative body for regulating the Norwegian language as used by the newspaper. Due to its status as the country's largest and most influential newspaper, Aftenposten therefore had a significant influence on the developments that took place during the Norwegian language struggle. The \"moderate\" or \"conservative\" Riksm\u00e5l language used by Aftenposten was mainly associated with a conservative stance in Norwegian politics, and was contrasted with the \"radical\" Samnorsk language, an attempt to merge Bokm\u00e5l with Nynorsk which was promoted by socialist governments in the 1950s. By 1960 it had become apparent that the Samnorsk attempt had failed, and as a result, Aftenposten's Riksm\u00e5l standard and the government-promoted Bokm\u00e5l standard have in the following decades become almost identical as the Bokm\u00e5l standard has incorporated nearly all of Riksm\u00e5l. As a consequence, Aftenposten decided to describe its language as \"Moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" from 2006, and published its own dictionary, based on Riksm\u00e5l and Moderate Bokm\u00e5l, but excluding \"radical\" (i.e. similar to Nynorsk) variants of Bokm\u00e5l.\nThe online version of the paper for some years during the early 2000s had an English section.

Engineer Robin Black had worked with the band in the mid-1970s on Sabotage and received a co-producer credit on Born Again.\nDuring recording, the band members lived at Manor Studio while Gillan chose to live outside the house, alone, in a marquee tent on the studio grounds: \"I thought he was joking, but when I arrived at the Manor I saw this marquee outside and I thought, fucking hell, he's serious. Ian had put up this big, huge tent. It had a cooking area and a bedroom and whatever else\", said Iommi. Butler said that the tent situation and Gillan's refusal to live with his new bandmates, in hindsight, likely indicated that the vocalist didn't view himself as a member of the band.\"Ian's lyrics were about sexual things or true facts, even about stuff that happened at The Manor there and then,\" Iommi said. \"They were good, but quite a departure from Geezer's and Ronnie's lyrics.\" For example, Gillan returned from a local pub one evening, took a car belonging to drummer Ward, and commenced racing around a go-cart track on the Manor Studio property. He crashed the car, which burst into flames after he escaped uninjured. He wrote the album's opening \"Trashed\" about the experience. Butler felt that Gillan's lyrics on tracks such as \"Digital Bitch\" and \"Keep It Warm\" were good, but much better suited to the musical style of Deep Purple than Black Sabbath.\"Disturbing the Priest\" was written after a rehearsal space \u2013 set up by Iommi in a small building near a local church \u2013 received noise complaints from the resident priests. \"We wanted this effect on 'Disturbing the Priest',\" recalled the guitarist, \"and Bill got this big bucket of water and he got this anvil. It was really heavy, and he'd got it hanging on a piece of rope and lower it in to get this effect: hit it and lower it in, and then lift it out again. It was a great effect, but it took hours to do.\"The band got along well, but it became apparent to all involved that Gillan's style did not quite mesh with the Sabbath sound. In 1992, he told director Martin Baker, \"I was the worst singer Black Sabbath ever had. It was totally, totally incompatible with any music they'd ever done. I didn't wear leathers, I wasn't of that image...I think the fans probably were in a total state of confusion.\" In 1992, Iommi admitted to Guitar World, \"Ian is a great singer, but he's from a completely different background, and it was difficult for him to come in and sing Sabbath material.\"\n\"I saw Ian go into the studio one day,\" Ward recalled, \"and I was fortunate and honoured, actually, to be part of a session. I watched him lay tracks on 'Keep It Warm'\u2026 I felt like Ian was Ian in that song\u2026 I watched this incredible transformation of this man that really, I felt, delicately put lyrics together. It made sense. I thought he did an excellent job. And I really dig that song too.\"\"I did some of the best drum work on that album\u2026\" Bill Ward recalled. \"On 'Disturbing the Priest', there were some polyrhythms and some counterpoint things that I was doing, and I was using at least twenty different pieces of percussion towards the end of that song\u2026 I was real proud of a lot of the work that I did. Some of it invariably got lost in the mix, but I know that it's printed on those tracks.\" Butler said that Ward began acting quite strangely during recording and was angrier than he had ever seen him. At one point the drummer began hallucinating and had to be hospitalized, and while he was there the band discovered his secret stash of vodka that he'd been consuming in secret at night. After being released from the hospital, Ward quit the band again and returned to America to sort out his issues, with his drum parts already recorded.When the band heard the final product, they were horrified at the muffled mix. In his autobiography, Iommi explains that Gillan inadvertently blew a couple of tweeters in the studio speakers by playing the backing tracks too loud and nobody noticed. \"We just thought it was a bit of a funny sound, but it went very wrong somewhere between the mix and the mastering and the pressing of that album...the sound was really dull and muffly. I didn't know about it, because we were already out on tour in Europe. By the time we heard the album, it was out and in the charts, but the sound was awful.\" Butler recalled listening to the tapes in his hotel room and being alarmed at how \"muffled and unclear\" the tracks were, but Iommi and Black assured him that the issue would be corrected during mixing. Ultimately, the issue never was corrected, with Butler lamenting years later that \"that's what happens when you don't hire a bona fide producer, like Martin Birch, to handle things.\"For all his misgivings, Gillan remembers the period fondly, stating in the Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992 documentary, \"But by God, we had a good year...And the songs, I think, were quite good.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1923 Aftenposten adopted the Norwegian spelling standard of 1907, which mainly replaced the \"soft\" consonants (e.g. d, b) characteristic of Danish pronunciation (but also used in some Norwegian dialects) with \"hard\" consonants (e.g. t, p) characteristic of Eastern Central Norwegian pronunciation, but which was otherwise mostly identical with Danish.  In 1928 Aftenposten adopted the most conservative variant of the spelling standard of 1917, which is largely similar to the \"moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" or \"Riksm\u00e5l\" standard used today.\nDuring the Norwegian language struggle from the early 1950s, Aftenposten was the main newspaper of the Riksm\u00e5l variety of Norwegian, and maintained close ties to the Riksm\u00e5l movement's institutions, recognising the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature as the sole authoritative body for regulating the Norwegian language as used by the newspaper. Due to its status as the country's largest and most influential newspaper, Aftenposten therefore had a significant influence on the developments that took place during the Norwegian language struggle. The \"moderate\" or \"conservative\" Riksm\u00e5l language used by Aftenposten was mainly associated with a conservative stance in Norwegian politics, and was contrasted with the \"radical\" Samnorsk language, an attempt to merge Bokm\u00e5l with Nynorsk which was promoted by socialist governments in the 1950s. By 1960 it had become apparent that the Samnorsk attempt had failed, and as a result, Aftenposten's Riksm\u00e5l standard and the government-promoted Bokm\u00e5l standard have in the following decades become almost identical as the Bokm\u00e5l standard has incorporated nearly all of Riksm\u00e5l. As a consequence, Aftenposten decided to describe its language as \"Moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" from 2006, and published its own dictionary, based on Riksm\u00e5l and Moderate Bokm\u00e5l, but excluding \"radical\" (i.e. similar to Nynorsk) variants of Bokm\u00e5l.\nThe online version of the paper for some years during the early 2000s had an English section.

In 1923 Aftenposten adopted the Norwegian spelling standard of 1907, which mainly replaced the \"soft\" consonants (e.g. d, b) characteristic of Danish pronunciation (but also used in some Norwegian dialects) with \"hard\" consonants (e.g. t, p) characteristic of Eastern Central Norwegian pronunciation, but which was otherwise mostly identical with Danish.  In 1928 Aftenposten adopted the most conservative variant of the spelling standard of 1917, which is largely similar to the \"moderate Bokm\u00e5l\" or \"Riksm\u00e5l\" standard used today.\nDuring the Norwegian language struggle from the early 1950s, Aftenposten was the main newspaper of the Riksm\u00e5l variety of Norwegian, and maintained close ties to the Riksm\u00e5l movement's institutions, recognising the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature as the sole authoritative body for regulating the Norwegian language as used by the newspaper. Due to its status as the country's largest and most influential newspaper, Aftenposten therefore had a significant influence on the developments that took place during the Norwegian language struggle. The \"moderate\" or \"conservative\" Riksm\u00e5l language used by Aftenposten was mainly associated with a conservative stance in Norwegian politics, and was contrasted with the \"radical\" Samnorsk language, an attempt to merge Bokm\u00e5l with Nynorsk which was promoted by socialist governments in the 1950s. By 1960 it had become apparent that the Samnorsk attempt had failed, and as a result, Aftenposten's Riksm\u00e5l standard and the government-promoted Bokm\u00e5l standard have in the following decades become almost identical as the Bokm\u00e5l standard has incorporated nearly all of Riksm\u00e5l.

Too easy. Because I am protected by my family circle, by this success that gives me some strength. Those who listen to me do not always have them, that security.\" However, as noted by psychologist Hugues Royer, suicide evoked in the lyrics is intended to relieve a too heavy sadness, but to avoid, paradoxically, the horizon of a possible happiness.", "hasanswer": false}]}
