Despite the lack of success of these releases, Bridges came to the attention of Bill Lowery, who became her manager, subsidizing Bridges over a roughly two-year period. During this time, he canvassed record labels on her behalf, which led to her signing with Polydor in 1977.\nBridges's self-titled debut album was the inaugural production by Steve Buckingham, who was assigned to produce Bridges after playing guitar on one of her earliest sessions. Bridges and her personal and songwriting partner Susan Hutcheson had written a song entitled \"Disco 'Round\", which, at Buckingham's suggestion, was recorded as \"I Love the Nightlife\", as Buckingham felt that the song was R&B rather than disco (\"Disco 'Round\" was retained as the song's subtitle): Bridges herself would later admit she had had hopes that the song would be received as a Memphis soul number, calling it \"something Al Green might sing\". However, club support was a key factor in the success of the track, which became a \"sleeper\" Top 40 hit, spending 27 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 with a peak of number five, and also appearing on several international hit parades as evinced by the Billboard's \"Hits of the World\" chart. The song was also in the #5 position on the Record World and Cash Box charts. It was also a \"crossover\" hit, receiving play even on country music stations. The cover of the 1978 self-titled LP features an early skyline picture of Atlanta, Georgia.\nIn 1978, Bridges was a Grammy nominee and was the opening act, performing \"I Love the Nightlife\". Bridges' self-titled LP, Alicia Bridges, was also rising on the Billboard, Cash Box and Record World charts, and the LP remained on the charts for up to 35 weeks. Both the LP and the single release were international successes, and \"I Love the Nightlife\" went top-40 in the UK and Germany, Spain and other European countries. Bridges's music was especially popular in Japan. She received an RIAA Certified Gold Record for the sale of over one million copies of her hit single in the United States, as well as a gold record from Canada.\nContrary to the impression created by her success with \"I Love the Nightlife\", Bridges was primarily a singer of R&B, rock, blues and love songs. \"I Love the Nightlife\" has a definite back beat and organ similar to early 1970s R&B; the original intention was for \"I Love the Nightlife\" to be an R&B song, but when Bill Lowery first heard the song, he saw its disco potential: subsequently, a 12\" single remix was created by Jim Burgess, ultimately becoming a worldwide club smash.\n\"I Love the Nightlife\" has been featured in several movies, including Love at First Bite, The Last Days of Disco and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\nBridges's second single, \"Body Heat\", was a rock song with strong electric guitar rhythms. It was a \"rock/dance\" song released at a time when there was some rivalry between disco fans and rock fans; this time period began to see more songs that mixed the genres of rock and disco to create a \"rock/disco\" flavor.\nIn an interview, Bridges mentioned Elvis Presley as the singer who originally aroused her interest in rock music, but she has always considered herself an R&B singer. She cited Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle as her 1970s influences. She said that she did not care for white female singers as a rule, with the exceptions being Joni Mitchell and Janis Joplin. She complained that white women sounded as though they were \"sleepwalking\" through their performances. \"Yeah, I jump around a lot when I'm performing,\" she said.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Green (bass) renamed the band and decided to use a drum machine for percussion. Melding heavy metal with industrial music and later with electronic music and dub, Godflesh's sound is widely regarded as a foundational influence on other industrial metal and post-metal acts and as significant to both experimental and extreme metal.The band signed to Earache Records in the late 1980s and released their debut album Streetcleaner (1989) to contemporary and lasting acclaim. After the release of their sophomore album Pure (1992) and their major label debut Selfless (1994), they started experimenting with live drums as well as hip hop and breakbeat sounds. The resulting albums, Songs of Love and Hate (1996) and Us and Them (1999), were followed by Hymns (2001), which saw a simplification of the band's style. Shortly after Green's departure in 2002, Broadrick ended Godflesh and pursued various other projects, such as Jesu.

Internationally, his fame arises chiefly from his extensive body of choral music, which exceeds 500 individual choral songs, most of it a cappella. The great majority of these pieces are based on traditional ancient Estonian folksongs (regilaulud), either textually, melodically, or merely stylistically.\nHis composition most often performed outside Estonia, Curse Upon Iron (Raua needmine) (1972), invokes ancient Shamanistic traditions to construct an allegory about the evils of war. Some of his works were banned by the Soviet government, but because folk music was fundamental to his style most of his compositions were accepted by the censors.\nMore recently, Tormis' works have been performed and recorded by T\u00f5nu Kaljuste with the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, and others. In the 1990s, Tormis began to receive commissions from some a cappella groups as the King's Singers and the Hilliard Ensemble.\nTormis famously said of his settings of traditional melodies and verse: \"It is not I who makes use of folk music, it is folk music that makes use of me.\" His work demonstrates his conviction that traditional Estonian and other Balto-Finnic music represents a treasure which must be guarded and nourished, and that culture may be kept alive through the medium of song.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was brought up by his father and stepmother, with whom he became disillusioned because of her religious beliefs (although they reconciled in 1980, just before her death). His anti-religious views would later become a familiar theme within his music.Harper began writing poems when he was 12. At the age of 13. he began playing skiffle music with his younger brother David (\"Davey\" on the album Flat Baroque and Berserk), as well as becoming influenced by blues music. At 14 he formed his first group (De Boys) with his brothers David and Harry. Harper was educated at King Edward VII School, Lytham St Annes, then a grammar school, and left at the age of 15 (1956) to join the Royal Air Force to follow an ambition to be a pilot. After two years Harper rejected the rigid discipline and feigned madness to obtain a military discharge, as a result receiving an electroconvulsive therapy treatment at Princess Mary's RAF Hospital, Wendover. After being discharged from there, he spent one day inside the former Lancaster Moor Mental Institute before escaping. These experiences would be recalled in \"Committed\", a song on Harper's debut album, Sophisticated Beggar. From around 1961 he busked around North Africa, Europe and London for a few years.\nMusically, Harper's earliest influences were American blues musician Lead Belly and folk singer Woody Guthrie and, in his teens, jazz musician Miles Davis. Of the blues musicians Lead Belly, Big Bill Broonzy, and Josh White, Harper said they made music which \"...seemed to be from a different planet ...We'd never heard anything like it. It changed our world overnight, a sledge hammer of a cultural change ...an equivalent would be to suddenly hear music from outer space\". Harper was also exposed to classical music in his childhood and has pointed to the influence of Jean Sibelius's Karelia Suite. Lyrical influences include the 19th century Romantics, especially Shelley, and Keats's poem \"Endymion\". Harper has also cited the Beat poets as being highly influential, particularly Jack Kerouac. Harper played his first paid performance at a poetry reading in Newcastle in 1960.\nReturning to the UK in 1963 or 1964, Harper started to write more songs than poetry. He obtained a residency at London's famous Soho folk music club Les Cousins in 1965, having been introduced to it by Peter Bellamy of The Young Tradition. Harper's first advertised performance was on 5 October 1965.

Both these songs were removed from the 2010 DVD re-release of the English dub of Kiki's Delivery Service. Paul Chihara composed the music for the dub, adding music to scenes that were silent in the original Japanese version.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_39353", "text": "A major theme of the film is maturity. After leaving her parents who are supportive of her independence, Kiki has to face problems common to adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself. Dani Cavallaro notes that Kiki's Delivery Service also explores politeness, stating that the theme stems from a need to interact with others well in an unfamiliar setting. The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling notes a scene during Kiki's first night away from home where Kiki rushes back to her room and slams the door behind her to avoid being spotted by Fukuo. Fukuo, however, steps outside simply to stretch his arms, and Kiki's bizarrely shy behavior \"expresses [her] youth, vulnerability, and isolation.\"Another theme is the transition from traditional to contemporary. Kiki is shown to balance both of these qualities. For instance, Kiki observes the tradition of witches wearing black, but adorns her hair with a bright red bow. Kiki also engages in other traditional methods, such as baking with a wood-burning stove and flying her mother's old broom.Kiki's loss of her witch powers is considered the worst crisis she has to face during the film. Her loss of flight reflects the harm dealt to Kiki by her own self-doubts. This hardship causes Kiki to realize that being vulnerable does not always lead to failure and can help her learn valuable lessons to better understand herself. Petrana Radulovic also suggests that Jiji's bond with Kiki represents the experiences she had as a child, and that once Kiki loses her powers to talk to Jiji, she becomes more lonely. Jiji had served as the wiser voice (imaginary companion) to Kiki, and she stopped being able to understand him the moment she struggles with self-doubt. According to Miyazaki himself, Jiji is meant to represent the immature side of Kiki, and her inability to talk to Jiji represents her newfound maturity at the end of the movie.In relation to Kiki's portrayal as a witch, some have drawn comparisons to historical or contemporary views on witches and witchcraft. The film incorporates some conventions from fairy-tales such as a black cat companion for Kiki, Kiki's use of a broom for flight, and her black dress. While girls with magical powers are common in Japanese television, Miyazaki wanted to stray away from the various stereotypes generated from these shows, remarking that witchcraft \"has always merely been the means to fulfill the dreams of young girls.\" This stereotypical portrayal of witches is also shown in the older witch Kiki encounters while travelling to Koriko.Kiki has also been compared to other characters in Miyazaki's films. While there are overt differences in demeanor between Kiki and San from Princess Mononoke, a character who is motivated by anger, both characters take control over their own lives. This theme of remarkable independence is also seen in Miyazaki's earlier works, such as in Nausica\u00e4 in Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind. Kiki is also compared to Chihiro of Spirited Away as they are both young girls attempting to seek independence without being rebellious. Both Chihiro and Kiki develop their independence with the help of their friends.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Together they produced a self-released demo tape, Black Winds, in 1991.\nIn 1992, Enthrone changed its name to \"Carpathian Forest\", and Lord Blackmangler and Damnatus joined their line-up. As a quartet they self-released three demo tapes: Rehearsal Outtake, Bloodlust and Perversion (both in 1992) and Journey Through the Cold Moors of Svarttjern (in 1993). However, Damnatus and Lord Blackmangler left afterwards, and Carpathian Forest became once more a duo.\nCarpathian Forest would release their first studio work in 1995: the extended play Through Chasm, Caves and Titan Woods, via Avantgarde Music. It would be their first of many releases via Avantgarde.\nIn 1998 the band released their first full-length album, Black Shining Leather, once more via Avantgarde Music. It was their only release to feature Lazare (who would later join Borknagar) on the band's line-up as a drummer. In the same year they also played their first concert at the Under the Black Sun Festival in Sch\u00f6nermark, Germany.\nLazare left Carpathian Forest in 1999, the same year Anders Kobro, Tchort and Daniel Vrangsinn joined them as permanent members. In the following year, their second full-length, Strange Old Brew, was released. It was their most experimental album so far. By the end of the year they also released a single, \"He's Turning Blue\".\nIn 2001, founding member Nordavind left Carpathian Forest, during the recording sessions of their third studio album, Morbid Fascination of Death, that still retained the experimentation (although to a lesser extent) of their previous release, Strange Old Brew. In the following year the compilation album We're Going to Hell for This: Over a Decade of Perversions was released, in order to celebrate the band's 10th anniversary as Carpathian Forest. It was their last album to be released by Avantgarde Music before they switched on to Season of Mist.\nTheir fourth full-length, Defending the Throne of Evil, was released in 2003 by Season of Mist. Contrasting with Carpathian Forest's previous releases, it was their most melodic album so far, almost reminiscent of symphonic black metal. In late 2003 the band was joined by G\u00f8ran \"Blood Pervertor\" Bomann.\n2004 saw the release of a live DVD, We're Going to Hollywood for This, and a compilation album featuring rarities and reworked versions of old Carpathian Forest songs, Skjend hans lik (Norwegian for \"Desecrate His Body\").\nCarpathian Forest's latest studio album was the 2006 release Fuck You All!!!! Caput tuum in ano est, that was a throwback to their early, blackened thrash metal-like sonority of their debut.\n\nIn an early 2008 issue of Terrorizer, Tchort spoke about the possibility of a new album, and the rumors circulating regarding a \"half-finished album\". He is quoted as saying: \"I met with Nattefrost a few weeks ago and we decided to focus on a new album, but we haven't even started writing it yet. The news that we had an album half-finished was based on the fact that we had material left over from the last album. Since we record in different studios, this meant that I had the basics for music that Nattefrost never heard\". He also divulged that \"[we] kind of decided on a slightly new direction for the band, compared to Fuck You All, at least\".\nThe band co-headlined the Inferno Festival in 2009, and confirmed rumors that a new album was in the works.The band entered on a relative hiatus after 2009, but from 2012 onwards they began to play on some festivals around Europe. The band was scheduled to play on the Maryland Deathfest on 26 May 2013, but their show had to be cancelled due to last-minute visa problems.

In concert, DVS Mindz was backed by several different DJs, including Def DJ, DJ Vee, and Kutaculous. The band's sound was sparse, with raw beats and furious, nonstop rhyming from all members. DVS Mindz had catchy material, but many of its songs featured no chorus, just a sparse beat and verse after verse from the MCs. The band's lyrics were packed with inside jokes, mythology, pop-culture references, puns, numerology, religion, violence, and obscure references to the group's history. Each member also had alter egos and pseudonyms, and they sometimes rapped in those voices (For example, Str8Jakkett had another alter ego known as \"Wrexx\").

Other new songs that were demoed included \"Money is the Root of All Evil,\" \"Smoking Song,\" \"The Gospel of John,\" \"Deeper Than Most,\" and \"You Don't Want No Beef.\" A new song, \"Heat,\" which had become a live staple, was issued on the 2001 compilation \"Scars & Tattoos Midwest Compilation.\" DVS Mindz also completed a full-length documentary film entitled DVStory that is available on YouTube.\nIn May, 2001, DL guested on a track entitled \u201cDevious\u201d by the Lawrence frat-funk group Phat Albert. A positive review in the Lawrence Journal-World described the song this way: \"Featuring rip-snorting raps from DL (DVS Mindz), Deadly (The Zou) and the sublime vocal stylings of Aaron D (KB Posse), the song has quickly jumped into the public consciousness. It's spent the last several weeks at No. 1 on MP3.com's local hip-hop charts and has maneuvered its way onto area airwaves via\"Classic Underground Sound\" and \"Breakfast For Beat Lovers,\" radio shows found on KJHK 90.7 FM.In March, 2002, Kutaculous released a compilation disc entitled G-Coffee, that consisted of tracks recorded with various rappers in his Topeka studio. The members of DVS Mindz appeared on the disc, but there was no group track.

D.O.P.E. issued a mixtape, Live @ the BarberShop, and a full-length solo album, Dangerous On Paper & Etc.: The D.O.P.E. LP, was released in July, 2005. The album featured 17 tracks, 14 produced by D.O.P.E. A followup, N.O.C.O.A.S.T., was released the next year. A single entitled \"Someone 4 Me\" was played on several radio stations across the country. D.O.P.E. also continued to work as a producer, including work on a large portion of Str8jakkett's Mood Swings album. He was offered a major-label deal with Arista Records that fell through when the label folded. He is currently working on a new album, \"Beats Rhymes & Life\".\nDVS Mindz never officially broke up, but it remained largely inactive during the 2000s and 2010s. The group members continued to make music separately, although they remained friendly and worked together or reunited on stage from time to time.\nIn 2007, Str8jakkett released his solo debut, the 20-track Mood Swings. \"Everyone in DVS Mindz is featured in this album, but \"[it's] about me,\" Str8jakkett told a reporter. \"I wanted people to know where this came from, where it's been, and where I'm at now. ... I'm introducing myself to the world.\" The disc received a lukewarm review from The Pitch writer Andrew Miller: \u201cHis beats sound like they've been sitting on the shelf for at least a decade ... at 78 minutes, Mood Swings runs a few tracks too long and includes the standard rap-album filler: voice-mail messages, a bank-robbery skit and a fake live radio spot from \u2018DJ Dick Goesinya at Club Nutsack.\u2019\" Journalist Chris Mills countered with a glowing review in Demencha Magazine, stating, \"Str8jakkett is a pure lyricist with a seasoned delivery and a flashy vocabulary ... Most of the beats on Mood Swings have a refreshing, bassy, West Coat influence, while Str8's manner of rapping is sodden with enough straight talk to please any indie head.\" Mood Swings included a re-recording of the unreleased DVS Mindz track \"Flamethrower,\" with Str8jakkett replacing the second and third verses recorded by DL and Killa The Hun, respectively. Another old DVS Mindz song, \"Birds,\" was given a complete makeover, as was a retooled version of \"DVS Mindbender,\" which appeared in its original form on Million Dolla Broke Niggaz.\nStr8kjakkett issued a second solo effort in 2008 titled, G.A.M.E. Grown-Ass Man Experience. The effort included \"The DVS Story\" where Str8jakkett recounted the band's rise and fall in candid terms.

When we worked on those in the group, Terry Cox worked out his percussion patterns to match the patterns in the songs exactly. In that respect he was the opposite of a folk-rock drummer.\" This approach to songs led to the use of unusual time signatures: \"Market Song\" from Sweet Child moves from 7/4 to 11/4 and 4/4 time, and \"Light Flight\" from Basket of Light includes sections in 5/8, 7/8 and 6/4.Writing in The Times, Henry Raynor struggled to put the band's music into a category. \"It is not a pop group, not a folk group and not a jazz group. What it attempts is music which is a synthesis of all these and other styles, as well as interesting experiments in each of them individually.\" Even Pentangle's earliest work is characterised by this synthesis of styles, and songs such as \"Bruton Town\" and \"Let No Man Steal Your Thyme\" from 1968's The Pentangle include elements of folk, jazz, blues and early music. Pete Townshend described their sound as \"fresh and innovative\". By the time they released their fourth album, Cruel Sister, in 1970, Pentangle had reverted to traditional folk music and had begun to use electric guitars. Folk music in Britain had moved towards a rock sound and the use of electrified instruments, and Cruel Sister invited comparison with such works as Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief and Steeleye Span's Hark! The Village Wait, which caused Pentangle to be referred to as one of the progenitors of British folk rock.In their final two albums Pentangle returned to their folk-jazz roots, but by then the genre's musical tastes had moved to British folk rock.

Minogue is the highest-selling female recording artist from Australia, having sold over 80 million records worldwide. She has been recognised for reinventing herself in music as well as fashion, and is referred to by the European press as the \"Princess of Pop\" and a style icon. Her accolades include two Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards and eighteen ARIA Music Awards.\nBorn and raised in Melbourne, Minogue first achieved recognition starring as Charlene Robinson in the Australian soap opera Neighbours (1986\u20131988). She began her music career in the late 1980s, releasing four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums under PWL. By the early 1990s, Minogue had amassed several top ten singles in Australia and the UK, including \"The Loco-Motion\", \"I Should Be So Lucky\", \"Especially for You\", \"Hand on Your Heart\" and \"Better the Devil You Know\". Taking more creative control over her music, she signed with Deconstruction Records in 1993 and released the albums Kylie Minogue (1994) and Impossible Princess (1997).\nBy joining Parlophone in 1999, Minogue returned to mainstream dance-oriented music with Light Years (2000), including the number-one hits \"Spinning Around\" and \"On a Night Like This\". The follow-up, Fever (2001), was an international breakthrough for Minogue, becoming her best-selling album to date. Its lead single, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" became one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, selling over five million units. Follow up singles, \"In Your Eyes\" and \"Love at First Sight\" became hits as well. She continued reinventing her image and experimenting with a range of genres on her subsequent albums, which spawned successful singles such as \"Slow\", \"I Believe in You\", \"2 Hearts\" and \"All the Lovers\". In 2017, she partnered with BMG Rights Management, with \"Dancing\" (2018) as their first release. In the following years, Minogue became the only female artist to have a number-one album and a top ten single, from the 1980s to the 2020s in the UK charts, with Disco (2020) and \"Padam Padam\" (2023) respectively.\nIn film, Minogue made her debut in The Delinquents (1989), and appeared in Street Fighter (1994), Moulin Rouge! (2001), Holy Motors (2012) and San Andreas (2015). In reality television, she appeared as a judge on The Voice UK and The Voice Australia both in 2014. Her other ventures include product endorsements, books, perfumes, charitable work and a wine brand. Minogue's achievements include being an ARIA Hall of Fame inductee, Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Chevalier (knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and an honorary Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_39560", "text": "Minogue explained she first became interested in pop music during her adolescence: \"I first got into pop music in 1981, I'd say. It was all about Prince, Adam + the Ants, that whole New Romantic period. Prior to that, it was the Jackson 5, Donna Summer, and my dad's records \u2013 the Stones and Beatles.\" She would also listen to the records of Olivia Newton-John and ABBA. She said she \"wanted to be\" Newton-John while growing up. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue during the early years of her music career with the observation: \"She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna ... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her.\" Minogue came to prominence in the music scene as a bubblegum pop singer and was deemed a \"product of the Stock Aitken Waterman Hit Factory\". Australian musician Nick Cave, who worked with her, was a major influence on her artistic development. She told The Guardian: \"He's definitely infiltrated my life in beautiful and profound ways.\" Throughout her career, her work was also influenced by British singer-songwriter-producer Cathy Dennis, British record producer D Mob, British band Scritti Politti, Icelandic singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rk, British rapper Tricky, Irish rock band U2 and Japanese pop band Pizzicato Five, among others.\nMinogue has been known for her soft soprano vocal range. Tim Sendra of AllMusic reviewed her album Aphrodite and said Minogue's \"slightly nasal, girl next door vocals serve her needs perfectly.\" According to Fiona MacDonald from Madison magazine, Minogue \"has never shied away from making some brave but questionable artistic decisions\". In musical terms, Minogue has worked with many genres in pop and dance music. However, her signature music has been contemporary disco music. Her first studio albums with Stock, Aitken, and Waterman present a more bubblegum pop influence, with many critics comparing her to American singer-songwriter Madonna. Chris True from AllMusic, reviewed her debut album, Kylie and found her music \"standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum\", however he stated she presented the most personality of any 1980s recording artist. He said of her third album Rhythm of Love, from the early 1990s, \"The songwriting is stronger, the production dynamic, and Kylie seems more confident vocally.\" At the time of her third studio album, \"She began to trade in her cutesy, bubblegum pop image for a more mature one, and in turn, a more sexual one.\" Chris True stated during her relationship with Australian singer-actor Michael Hutchence, \"her shedding of the near-virginal fa\u00e7ade that dominated her first two albums, began to have an effect, not only on how the press and her fans treated her, but in the evolution of her music.\"Her self-titled fifth studio album, primarily a dance-pop album integrating elements of R&B and adult contemporary music saw a shift in her music. Chris True of AllMusic stated the album is a \"remarkable change from Minogue's previous teen pop material\" and the \"start of a second phase\" in her music career. From her work on her sixth studio album, Impossible Princess, her songwriting and musical content began to change. She was constantly writing down words, exploring the form and meaning of sentences. She had written lyrics before, but called them \"safe, just neatly rhymed words and that's that\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine said the album bears a resemblance to Madonna's Ray of Light (1998). He said she took inspiration from \"both the Britpop and electronica movements of the mid-'90s\", saying \"Impossible Princess is the work of an artist willing to take risks\".Her seventh studio album, Light Years is a disco-influenced dance-pop record, with AllMusic's Chris True calling it \"Arguably one of the best disco records since the '70s\". True stated her eighth studio album, Fever, \"combines the disco-diva comeback of Light Years with simple dance rhythms\". Her ninth studio album, Body Language, was quite different from her musical experiments in the past as it was a \"successful\" attempt at broadening her sound with electro and hip-hop for instance. Incorporating styles of dance music with funk, disco and R&B, the album was listed on Q's \"Best Albums of 2003\".Critics said Minogue's tenth studio album X did not feature enough \"consistency\" and Chris True called the tracks \"cold, calculated dance-pop numbers.\" Tim Sendra of AllMusic said her eleventh album, Aphrodite, \"rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems\" and \"the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop that really is her strong suit.\" Sendra found Aphrodite \"One of her best, in fact.\" Kiss Me Once, her twelfth studio album has been described by critics as her return to contemporary pop music.Her fourteenth studio album, Golden was heavily influenced by country music, although maintaining her dance-pop sensibilities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote \"Golden further bolsters Minogue's reputation for taking risks\u2014and artfully sets the stage for her inevitable disco comeback.\" For her fifteenth studio album, Disco, she began\nto audio engineer her own music due to the restrictions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_24573", "text": "Akcent (Romanian pronunciation: [ak\u02c8t\u0361\u0283ent]) is a Romanian dance pop group whose members sing in Romanian, English and Spanish.

She uses an aggressive vocal style and whines about how she is messed up despite having it all. \"Jump\" advises the public to accept her and her personal choices throughout the course of her career.\n\n\"I Don't Need Anyone\" does not have a linear storyline; the set of lyrics was taken from four songs, each interpreting a different mood and story. Cinquemani noted the energetic track sees Minogue wildly declare her independence while admitting her inborn vulnerability. \"Some Kind of Bliss\" talks about Minogue's experiences while away from people and being happy. Written in Japan, the fifth track, \"Breathe\", expresses her ability to contemplate and feel peaceful while in an intense environment. \"Dreams\" discussing the persistence of pushing boundaries and experimentation throughout her career. Phillips wrote that \"Dreams\", the closing cinematic track, tells a thought-provoking fairytale.The record's remaining tracks discuss her relationship with Sednaoui. \"Cowboy Style\" details Minogue meeting Sednaoui for the first time. Minogue wrote \"Limbo\" in Spain, in which she discusses her inability to leave a certain country to meet someone, because of problems with its bureaucracy. Inspired by her relationship with Sednaoui, \"Say Hey\" highlights the need for communication, though not delving into conversation. Flick highlighted the self-examining lyrics of \"Limbo\" and \"Say Hey\", commenting that Minogue had liberated darker thoughts from her subconscious on the album. The theme of frustration lingers in \"Drunk\", which has Minogue feeling unsatisfied with the relationship, despite having so much feeling for someone. Minogue mentions meeting an ex-boyfriend on \"Through the Years\", feeling insecure and doubtful about the entire situation.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "407_5644", "text": "Vivid is the tenth Japanese language studio album (12th overall) by Japanese singer-songwriter Crystal Kay.

Garcia and Kahn met in 1970 playing together at Monday jam sessions hosted by Howard Wales at the small San Francisco club, the Matrix.\nOver the years, the lineup of the Jerry Garcia Band changed many times. The one constant member besides Garcia himself was bassist John Kahn, who served as Garcia's principal musical collaborator outside of the Grateful Dead after 1970. Melvin Seals had the next longest tenure, serving as keyboardist from 1981 onward.\nJerry Garcia's musical interests were famously varied, and this was reflected in the diverse music played by his band. Like the Grateful Dead, the Jerry Garcia Band played rock music that was influenced by blues, folk, country, and jazz in an improvisatory milieu that largely served as a framework for Garcia's solos. However, the group eschewed the former band's avant-garde and world music influences in favor of a slower, groove-based \"bar band\" approach strongly oriented toward rhythm and blues (the band often featured female backing vocalists characteristic of the genre), gospel music and reggae. Rock versions of contemporary Americana were also prominent. The relatively languorous tempos were dictated by Garcia and Kahn, much to the chagrin of longtime drummer David Kemper: \"[I]t bothered me from the very beginning.

This band preceded me; the whole concept of the band preceded me.\"Staples of the band's repertoire included Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland's \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\" (widely perceived as the group's signature song and their most-performed song), Peter Rowan's \"Midnight Moonlight,\" Jimmy Cliff's \"The Harder They Come\" and \"Sitting in Limbo,\" the Sensational Nightingales' \"My Sisters and Brothers,\" Hank Ballard's \"Tore Up Over You,\" Bob McDill and Allen Reynolds' \"Catfish John,\" John Lennon's \"Dear Prudence,\" Jesse Stone's \"Don't Let Go,\" Allen Toussaint's \"I'll Take a Melody\" and \"Get Out of My Life, Woman\", Little Milton's \"That's What Love Will Make You Do,\" Chuck Berry's \"Let It Rock\" and \"You Never Can Tell,\" Bruce Cockburn's \"Waiting for a Miracle,\" Irving Berlin's \"Russian Lullaby,\" Smokey Robinson's \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\" and \"I Second That Emotion,\" Peter Tosh's \"Stop That Train,\" Bob Marley's \"Stir It Up,\" Robbie Robertson's \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\" the Manhattans' \"Shining Star,\" Van Morrison's \"And It Stoned Me\" and \"Bright Side of the Road\" and Norton Buffalo's \"Ain't No Bread in the Breadbox.\" The band also performed Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's \"Ol' Man River\" and Miles Davis' \"So What\" on one occasion apiece. As with the Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia regularly covered many songs by Bob Dylan with the group, including \"Tangled Up in Blue,\" \"Simple Twist of Fate,\" \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" \"Forever Young,\" \"Se\u00f1or (Tales of Yankee Power),\" \"Tears of Rage,\" \"I Shall Be Released,\" \"Tough Mama\" and \"When I Paint My Masterpiece.\"\nThe group did not perform between November 1978 and October 1979; during that year, Garcia, Kahn and keyboardist Merl Saunders (who performed with Garcia and Kahn from 1971 to 1975 in the Saunders/Garcia Band and Legion of Mary) briefly performed in Reconstruction, a more egalitarian jazz-funk ensemble.\nAccording to Linda Kahn in a 2017 Reddit Ask Me Anything prompt, much of the band's repertoire was curated by her husband: \"[H]e did bring most of the cover material to the table. He has a big record collection and they're all in really good shape, he was pretty anal about his records. I think as far as picking songs, he listened to records all the time, so it depends on whoever was in the band and whatever group was playing at the time and that influenced John a lot.\"Although the repertoire was strongly tilted toward covers, several Garcia-Robert Hunter originals (including \"Run for the Roses,\" \"Mission in the Rain,\" \"Gomorrah,\" \"Cats Under the Stars\" and \"Reuben and Cherise\") were performed exclusively or near-exclusively by the Jerry Garcia Band. Some of the band's original repertoire (most notably \"Deal,\" \"They Love Each Other,\" \"Sugaree,\" and \"Friend of the Devil\") was shared with the Grateful Dead.\nDuring Garcia's lifetime, the Jerry Garcia Band released one studio album, Cats Under the Stars, and one live album, Jerry Garcia Band. A number of additional live albums were released posthumously.\nThe group was an indirect beneficiary of the commercial success of the Grateful Dead's  In the Dark (1987); as the latter group transitioned to summer stadium tours and multi-night arena engagements during their autumn and spring tours, the tour itineraries of the Garcia Band (hitherto confined to clubs and small theaters) came to encompass arenas (primarily in Garcia's key northeastern United States market) and outdoor amphitheaters favored by the Grateful Dead in the early 1980s. During this period, the group continued to play as many as fifteen concerts a year in an informal residency at The Warfield, a 2,300-capacity theater in San Francisco. Clarence Clemons also guested with them on tour for a brief time in 1989 and 1990.Kahn briefly led the group (rechristened JGB) following Garcia's death in 1995.

All band members were between the ages of 13 and 15. After a few weeks the band changed its name to Urbana Gerila. Ne\u0161ovi\u0107 soon left to form his own group called Defektno Efektni. Featuring raw sound and drawing lyrical inspiration from, among other things, the events surrounding the activity of terrorist groups such as the Baader-Meinhof Group, Urbana Gerila had its first live performance as part of an event called Palilula Culture Olympics, in 1980, which was one of the first punk performances in Belgrade. Later, the band became a cult attraction, managing to sell out a Zagreb venue Lapidarij despite not having any recordings.\nThe band's two tracks, \"Proces\" (\"The Trial\") and \"Bez naslova\" (\"Untitled\") were released on the Artisti\u010dka radna akcija (Artistic Work Action) various artists compilation in late 1981, on which Ne\u0161ovi\u0107's Defekno Efektni also appeared.

After the compilation release, the band moved towards playing post-punk, influenced by Joy Division and Bauhaus, with the vocalist Branislav \"Kebra\" Babi\u0107, which was not well received by the audience.In 1981, the band performed as an opening act for the Rijeka band Paraf at the Belgrade SKC, before which Rosi\u0107 and Arsenijevi\u0107 decided to form an ad hoc band Berliner Strasse with the idea of various vocalists singing in different languages, but for the concert keeping only Petar \"\u0106irilo\" Ili\u0107 who could speak and sing in German, afterward becoming a full-time member. Berliner Strasse, influenced by the British post-punk and gothic rock scene and the German krautrock scene, performed songs with lyrics in German but later on in Serbian as well.

They formed in 1986 in Brisbane by Carol Rohde on vocals and keyboards (ex-Ironing Music) and David Smith on vocals, guitar and keyboards. They were soon joined by keyboardist, Brett Mitchell, and somewhat later by drummer-percussionist Crispin Trist.Boxcar independently issued cassette-only material including an album, P.C.M.. Their early work sounded similar to contemporaries, Cabaret Voltaire and Severed Heads. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, explained \"the intention was to combine noise with a beat, technology with a decent song.\" AllMusic's Michael Sutton felt they \"sounded more like New Order [the similarity] is mainly in the weary vocals of [Smith], which easily recalls Bernard Sumner's melancholic tone.\"Boxcar played live shows in the Brisbane area and then other capitals; at gigs they wore gas masks. Performing electronic music live was a difficult feat given the preference in Australian live venues for guitar-driven pub rock and they would sometimes be jeered by members of the crowd. McFarlane observed \"[they] made little headway, mostly due to a general lack of interest in electronic dance-pop within the rock milieu, rather than any lack of talent on the musicians' part.\"They signed with Volition Records/Sony Music Australia to release a single, \"Freemason (You Broke the Promise)\", in November 1988. When issued in the United States via Arista Records/Nettwerk Records in the following year, it hit No. 8 on the Billboard dance chart. Initially criticised in the local press for being derivative of New Order they nevertheless built a local following, despite a lack of commercial radio airplay for electronic music. They followed with two more singles, which also appeared on the Billboard dance chart: \"Insect\" (remixed by noted producer Arthur Baker) at No. 20 and \"Gas Stop (Who Do You Think You Are?)\" (remixed by Francois Kevorkian) at No. 8. In Australia, \"Gas Stop\" peaked at No. 82 on the ARIA singles chart.The group's first album on Volition, Vertigo, was released in November 1990. Boxcar's line-up was Mitchell on additional programming; Rohde on keyboards and programming; Smith on vocals, guitars and keyboards; and Trist on drums and programming. It was produced by Robert Racic (Severed Heads, Single Gun Theory) and recorded at Sun Studios, CBS Studios, and Albert Studios, Sydney.Vertigo received mixed reviews from critics: AllMusic's William Cooper rated it at two-and-a-half stars out-of five and explained \"[a]lthough the New Order inspired arrangements are derivative, Vertigo is redeemed by Boxcar's upbeat, catchy melodies\"; McFarlane opined that it \"was a very accessible collision of sound, song and dance beats.\" It had a fairly pop feel, however the band also included more experimental instrumentals, such as \"Comet\" (also on the B-side of the \"Freemason\" single) and \"Lelore\" (featuring an eerie wailing as the centrepiece \"vocal\", which was released as a single in its own right). The group toured Australia as supports for New Order, Depeche Mode, Erasure and then Pet Shop Boys.\nIn 1992 Rohde and Trist left the group, which relocated to Sydney, where they added a keyboardist, Stewart Lawler. In September of that year they issued a remix album, Revision, with re-workings of Vertigo' tracks by various producers. One of the remixers is Tom Ellard from Severed Heads.\nBoxcar's second studio album, Algorhythm, was released in November 1994. The Canberra Times' Nicole Leedham reported \"[it] is pure techno and is best heard on a dance floor, but if your house doesn't come equipped with one of those the best alternative is to light some candles and\nlose yourself in the hypnotic sound.\" McFarlane noticed \"[i]t was another modern-sounding album without being too clean or sterile.\"Algorhythm was a notably more trance and house-influenced effort than the  synth-pop of Vertigo and provided the singles \"Universal Hymn\", \"What Are You So Happy About?\" (featured on the soundtrack to the 1996 film Love and Other Catastrophes) and \"People Get High\". The album took almost another two full years until it was released in the United Kingdom and Europe in 1996 on Pulse-8. Although not officially defunct, it was around about 1997 that Boxcar started to play fewer live dates.\nIn October 2007, an announcement was made of their return gig participating in the Upgrade night at QUT. There is also a new track on their website, named for the infamous Atari ST game, Llamatron.

It stars Harry Dean Stanton and Emilio Estevez, with Tracey Walter, Olivia Barash, Sy Richardson, Vonetta McGee, Fox Harris, and Dick Rude among the supporting cast. Set in Los Angeles, the plot concerns a young punk rocker (Estevez) who is recruited by a car repossession agency and gets caught up in the pursuit of a mysterious Chevrolet Malibu that might be connected to extraterrestrials.\nA satire of America under the Reagan administration, consumerism and the Atomic Age, Repo Man was developed by Cox in partnership with his fellow film school graduates from UCLA, independent producers Jonathan Wacks and Peter McCarthy. His inspiration for the film came from his own experiences working with repossession agent Mark Lewis. Originally conceiving of it as a road movie, Cox reconfigured the story to take place mostly in Los Angeles to maintain its budget. Michael Nesmith of The Monkees came on board the project as an executive producer, and secured a negative pickup deal with Universal Pictures. Principal photography ran through summer 1983, during which Cox encouraged improvisation from the cast; the film's ending notably differed from what had originally been written. The soundtrack, headlined by a main theme composed and performed by Iggy Pop, is noted as a snapshot of 1980s hardcore punk; Cox wanted the music to underscore the life of repo men.Despite a troubled initial release due to Universal's skepticism towards the film's commercial viability, Repo Man received widespread acclaim, and was deemed by critics to be one of the best films of 1984. It has since gained a cult following, particularly surrounding Cox's re-edited version of the film for television due to its deliberate inclusion of surreal overdubs to replace profanity.

Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, James began his musical career in his teenage years. He was in various bands before entering the U.S. Navy Reserve to avoid being drafted into the army. In 1964, James moved to Toronto, Canada, where he formed the rock band the Mynah Birds, who eventually signed a recording deal with Motown Records in 1966. James's career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and eventually convicted him of desertion related charges. He served several months in jail.  After being released, James moved to California, where he started a variety of rock and funk groups in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nAfter forming the locally popular Stone City Band in his hometown of Buffalo in 1977, James finally found success as a recording artist after signing with Motown's Gordy Records, releasing the album Come Get It! in 1978 which produced the hits \"You & I\" and \"Mary Jane\". In 1981, James released his most successful album, Street Songs, which included career-defining hits such as \"Give It to Me Baby\" and \"Super Freak\", the latter song becoming his biggest crossover single, mixing elements of funk, disco, rock, and new wave. James was also known for his soulful ballads such as \"Fire & Desire\" and \"Ebony Eyes\". He also had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists including Teena Marie, the Mary Jane Girls, the Temptations, Eddie Murphy, and Smokey Robinson.\nJames's mainstream success had peaked by the release of his album Glow in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show, The A-Team. His subsequent album releases failed to sell as well as their predecessors. Rapper MC Hammer sampled James's \"Super Freak\" for his 1990 hit, \"U Can't Touch This\" which won Best R&B Song at the 1991 Grammy Awards. James received his only Grammy for composing the song. By the early 1990s, James's career was hampered by his drug addiction and he was embroiled in legal issues. In 1993, he was convicted of two separate instances of kidnapping and assaulting two different women while under the influence of crack cocaine, resulting in a three-year sentence at Folsom State Prison. He was released on parole in 1996. His health problems halted his career again after he had a mild stroke during a concert in 1998, and he announced a semi-retirement.\nIn 2004, James's career returned to mainstream pop culture after he appeared in an episode of Chappelle's Show.

With George, he wrote more than a dozen Broadway shows, featuring songs such as \"I Got Rhythm\", \"Embraceable You\", \"The Man I Love\" and \"Someone to Watch Over Me\". He was also responsible, along with DuBose Heyward, for the libretto to George's opera Porgy and Bess.\nThe success the Gershwin brothers had with their collaborative works has often overshadowed the creative role that Ira played. His mastery of songwriting continued after George's early death in 1937. Ira wrote additional hit songs with composers Jerome Kern, Kurt Weill, Harry Warren and Harold Arlen. His critically acclaimed 1959 book Lyrics on Several Occasions, an amalgam of autobiography and annotated anthology, is an important source for studying the art of the lyricist in the golden age of American popular song.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_39998", "text": "Gershwin was born at 60 Eldridge St in Manhattan, the oldest of four children of Morris (Moishe) and Rose Gershovitz (n\u00e9e Rosa Bruskin), who were Russian Jews from Saint Petersburg and who had immigrated to the United States in 1891. Ira's siblings were George (Jacob, b. 1898), Arthur (b. 1900), and Frances (b. 1906). Morris changed the family name to \"Gershwine\" (or alternatively \"Gershvin\") well before their children rose to fame; it was not spelled \"Gershwin\" until later. Shy in his youth, Ira spent much of his time at home reading, but from grammar school through college, he played a prominent part in several school newspapers and magazines.\nHe graduated in 1914 from Townsend Harris High School, a public school for intellectually gifted students, where he met Yip Harburg, with whom he enjoyed a lifelong friendship and a love of Gilbert and Sullivan. He attended the City College of New York but dropped out.The childhood home of Ira and George Gershwin was in the center of the Yiddish Theater District, on the second floor at 91 Second Avenue, between East 5th Street and East 6th Street. They frequented the local Yiddish theaters.While George began composing and \"plugging\" in Tin Pan Alley from the age of 18, Ira worked as a cashier in his father's Turkish baths. It was not until 1921 that Ira became involved in the music business. Alex Aarons signed Ira to write the songs for his next show, Two Little Girls in Blue, ultimately produced by Abraham Erlanger, along with co-composers Vincent Youmans and Paul Lannin. So as not to appear to trade off George's growing reputation, Ira wrote under the pseudonym \"Arthur Francis\", after his youngest two siblings. His lyrics were well received, allowing him successfully to enter the show-business world with just one show. Later the same year, the Gershwins collaborated for the first time on a score; this was for A Dangerous Maid, which played in Atlantic City and on tour.It was not until 1924 that Ira and George teamed up to write the music for what became their first Broadway hit Lady, Be Good. Once the brothers joined forces, their combined talents became one of the most influential forces in the history of American Musical Theatre. \"When the Gershwins teamed up to write songs for Lady, Be Good, the American musical found its native idiom.\" Together, they wrote the music for more than 12 shows and four films. Some of their more famous works include \"The Man I Love\", \"Fascinating Rhythm\", \"Someone to Watch Over Me\", \"I Got Rhythm\" and \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\". Their partnership continued until George's unexpected death from a brain tumor in 1937. Following his brother's death, Ira waited nearly three years before writing again.\nAfter this temporary retirement, Ira teamed up with accomplished composers such as Jerome Kern (Cover Girl); Kurt Weill (Where Do We Go from Here?; Lady in the Dark); Harry Warren (The Barkleys of Broadway); and Harold Arlen (Life Begins at 8:40; A Star Is Born). Over the next 14 years, Gershwin continued to write the lyrics for many film scores and a few Broadway shows. But the failure of Park Avenue in 1946 (a \"smart\" show about divorce, co-written with composer Arthur Schwartz) was his farewell to Broadway. As he wrote at the time, \"Am reading a couple of stories for possible musicalization (if there is such a word) but I hope I don't like them as I think I deserve a long rest.\"In 1947, he took 11 songs George had written but never used, provided them with new lyrics, and incorporated them into the Betty Grable film The Shocking Miss Pilgrim. He later wrote comic lyrics for Billy Wilder's 1964 movie Kiss Me, Stupid, although most critics believe his final major work was for the 1954 Judy Garland film A Star Is Born.American singer, pianist and musical historian Michael Feinstein worked for Gershwin in the lyricist's latter years, helping him with his archive. Several lost musical treasures were unearthed during this period, and Feinstein performed some of the material. Feinstein's book The Gershwins and Me: A Personal History in Twelve Songs about working for Ira, and George and Ira's music, was published in 2012.According to a 1999 story in Vanity Fair, Ira Gershwin's love for loud music was as great as his wife's loathing of it. When Debby Boone\u2014daughter-in-law of his neighbor Rosemary Clooney\u2014returned from Japan with one of the first Sony Walkmans (utilizing cassette tape), Clooney gave it to Michael Feinstein to give to Ira, \"so he could crank it in his ears, you know.

Among the leading French composers of his time, his work was rooted in the Impressionistic style of Debussy and Ravel, but in an idiosyncratic, individual style. Among his best known works are his early Flute Sonatine and Piano Sonata; concertos for cello, Tout un monde lointain... (\"A whole distant world\") and violin, L'arbre des songes (\"The tree of dreams\"); a string quartet known as Ainsi la nuit (\"Thus the night\"); and two symphonies: No. 1 (1951) and No. 2 Le Double (1959).Works were commissioned from him by such major artists as Charles Munch, George Szell, Mstislav Rostropovich, the Juilliard String Quartet, Isaac Stern, Paul Sacher, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Simon Rattle, Ren\u00e9e Fleming, and Seiji Ozawa. In addition to composing, he worked as the Head of Music Production for Radio France for 18 years. He also taught at the \u00c9cole Normale de Musique de Paris and at the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur de Musique, and was twice composer in residence at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts.\nAmong Dutilleux's many awards and honours were the Grand Prix de Rome (1938) and the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize (2005). When describing him, the music critic Paul Griffiths wrote that \"Mr. Dutilleux\u2019s position in French music was proudly solitary. Between Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez in age, he was little affected by either, though he took an interest in their work. But his voice, marked by sensuously handled harmony and color, was his own.\"", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40014", "text": "Dutilleux's music extends the legacies of French composers such as Debussy and Ravel but is also clearly influenced by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Igor Stravinsky. Among his favourite pieces, he mentioned Beethoven's late string quartets and Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande.His attitude toward serialism was ambiguous. While he always paid attention to developments in contemporary music and incorporated some serialist techniques into his work, he also criticized the more radical and intolerant aspects of the movement: \"What I reject is the dogma and the authoritarianism which manifested themselves in that period.\" Dutilleux refused to be associated with any school.Dutilleux's music contains distant echoes of jazz, as can be heard in the plucked double bass strings at the beginning of his First Symphony and his frequent use of syncopated rhythms. He often calls for Ray Robinson-style cup mutes in the brass section, which seems to indicate the influence of big band music. Dutilleux was greatly enamoured of vocalists, especially the jazz singer Sarah Vaughan and the great French chanson singers.Some of Dutilleux's trademarks include very refined orchestral textures; complex rhythms; a preference for atonality and modality over tonality; the use of pedal points that serve as atonal pitch centers; and \"reverse variation\", whereby a theme is revealed gradually, appearing in its complete form only after a few partial, tentative expositions. His music also displays a strong sense of structure and symmetry. This is particularly obvious from an \"external\" point of view, in the overall organisation of the different movements or the spatial distribution of the various instruments, but is also apparent in the music itself (themes, harmonies and rhythms mirroring, complementing or opposing each other). According to Stuart Jefferies, \"A passage may be conceived as a symmetrical shape of notes on paper and only later given musical substance. He loves symmetrical musical figures such as palindromes or fan-shaped phrases\".Dutilleux's music was influenced by art and literature, such as the works of Vincent van Gogh, Charles Baudelaire and Marcel Proust. It also shows a concern for the concepts of time and memory, both in its use of quotations (notably from Bart\u00f3k, Benjamin Britten, and Jehan Alain), and in short interludes that recall material used in earlier movements and/or introduce ideas that will be fully developed later.\nA perfectionist with a strong sense of artistic integrity, he allowed only a small number of his works to be published; what he did publish he often repeatedly revised. In his own words:\n\nI always doubt my work. I always have regrets. That's why I revise my work so much and, at the same time, I regret not being more prolific. But the reason I am not more prolific is because I doubt my work and spend a lot of time changing it.

He studied harmony, counterpoint, and piano with Victor Gallois at the Douai Conservatoire before leaving for the Conservatoire de Paris. There, between 1933 and 1938, he attended the classes of Jean and No\u00ebl Gallon (harmony and counterpoint, in which he won joint first prize with the cellist Paul Tortelier), Henri B\u00fcsser (composition) and Maurice Emmanuel (history of music).\nDutilleux won the Prix de Rome in 1938 for his cantata L'anneau du roi but did not complete his entire residency in Rome due to the outbreak of World War II. He worked for a year as a medical orderly in the army and returned to Paris in 1940, where he worked as a pianist, arranger and music teacher.

The game received critical acclaim, praising the mechanics, puzzles, graphics and soundtrack, but criticized the game's price relative to its length of play, eventually becoming the highest rated title on Xbox Live, and considered as one of the greatest video games ever made. It is seen as a keystone title in the growth of indie game development, and Blow and its production were documented in the 2012 film, Indie Game: The Movie.

I like sounds that relate to humanity, like Sufi music.\" Accordingly, several songs in the album have noticeably spiritual and devotional overtones.\"Khaireyan De Naal\" was the lead single and opening track on Tabeer and was used heavily to promote the album across music channels in both India and Pakistan. Ali borrowed the primary chorus line of the song from Tufail Niazi's folk song of the same name and wrote and composed the song around it. The song tells the story of the tragic romance of Heer Ranjha, a Punjabi folktale written in 1766 by the poet Waris Shah. Ali received significant critical acclaim for \"Khaireyan De Naal\" and has mentioned that it is his favorite track in the album. He also composed and sang a version of this song for the soundtrack of the 2015 Hindi movie, Tevar.The album has strong Sufi overtones and features five Sufi tracks \u2013 \"Rang Le,\" \"Bulleh Shah,\" \"Dum Ali Ali Dum,\" \"Rohi,\" and \"Pagalpan\":\n\n\"Rang Le\" is based on the well-known Sufi devotional song, Mohe Apne Hi Rang Mein Rang De, written by Sufi poet Amir Khusrau as a supplication to his spiritual guide \u2014 the Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya \u2014 beseeching him to dye Khusrau in the colors of divine love. The theme of immersive colors, dyes, and hues is a prominent motif in Sufi poetry and imagery and symbolizes union and oneness between the seeker and God (as the Beloved). Ali incorporated guitar- and accordion-led jazz improvisations into his arrangement of this track to lend it softer, romantic tones.\nThe song \"Bulleh Shah\" is based on the Sufi devotional Kafi Aao Saiyo Ral Deo Ni Wadhai written by the 18th-century poet and philosopher, Bulleh Shah, in which he celebrates the ecstasy of finding his murshid (spiritual teacher) \u2013 the Sufi saint Shah Inayat Qadiri. Ali chose to name the song eponymously in honor of its writer. He also performed a version of this song for Season 2 of MTV Unplugged in 2012.\nAli composed and wrote additional lyrics for the track \"Dum Ali Ali Dum\" which is a variation of the popular 600-year-old qawwali, \"Dama Dam Mast Qalandar,\" originally written by Amir Khusrau and modified further by Bulleh Shah. The song is a much-celebrated and widely-sung tribute to the Sufi mystic and saint Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and is part of the Indian subcontinent's cultural zeitgeist.\n\"Rohi\" is an adaptation of a Kafi titled \"Jindri Luti Te Yaar Sajan\" (also known as \"Dilri Luti Te Yaar Sajan\") written by the 19th-Century Sufi poet Khwaja Ghulam Farid. The Kafi was originally sung by Zahida Parveen, and various renditions of it have also been performed by Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Pathanay Khan, Mehdi Hassan, and Abida Parveen among others. The original verses are written in the little-known Saraiki dialect from a remote region of Pakistan, which led Ali to alter some of the lyrics to make the song easier to understand. He also modified the composition of the original song to render it in a more contemporary style while retaining the traditional folk sounds of the original.\n\"Pagalpan\" is inspired by Sindhi folk music and plays with the familiar Sufi theme of seeking a path to God and enlightenment while also acknowledging that God is within oneself.The song \"Kartar,\" set in raga Darbari, is based on a time-honored Patiala Gharana bandish, originally sung by Ali's father Ustad Amanat Ali Khan and uncle Ustad Bade Fateh Ali Khan. Ali described the track as an \"old traditional family song\" and has shared that he extended the sthayi of the original bandish to develop it into a song. In 2009, Ali delivered a live performance of \"Ajab Khail\" \u2014 a modified rendition of \"Kartar\" \u2014 for Season 2 of Coke Studio Pakistan, produced by Rohail Hyatt. \"Kartar\" is particularly noted for its rock riffs and high-octane orchestration, and it was featured again as a bonus track in Ali's second solo album, Kyun Dooriyan (2010), with a slightly different arrangement.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_38902", "text": "Rosario Di Bella (born 27 July 1963) is an Italian composer, singer-songwriter, music arranger and musician.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_22701", "text": "Tabeer (Urdu: \u062a\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u0631, Hindi: \u0924\u093e\u092c\u0940\u0930; transl.\u2009Interpretation or manifestation of dreams) is the debut solo studio album by Pakistani classical and pop singer, songwriter, and composer Shafqat Amanat Ali, released in India on September 9, 2008 by the Music Today label.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "495_61313", "text": "The film score for Cocktail was composed by Pritam, with lyrics by Irshad Kamil.

He was considered illiterate and he had trouble speaking English. Learning the accordion at age six, Abshire was influenced by his father, mother, and uncle who all played the accordion. Abshire began performing in public on the accordion when he was eight years old and he was considered to be an \"accomplished musician\"; he'd learned to play on an accordion that cost him $3.50.He was also influenced by the musician Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Ardoin. In an interview, Abshire said, \"Every Saturday afternoon some years ago, we used to go to John Foreman's saloon. I'd see Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Ardoin coming full-stride down the way. He'd say, \"Abshire, you've got to help me tonight.\"Abshire played with fiddler Lionel Leleux, who he also was taught by, and the accordion player Ardoin during the 1930s. He and the Rayne-Bo Ramblers, with the band leader being Leroy \"Happy Fats\" Leblanc,  performed six songs in 1935, with Abshire being listed in the credits as \"Nason Absher\". He also played with the Rayne-Bo Ramblers again in the 1960s.Abshire was a member the U.S. Army and was in World War II which stopped him from playing the accordion. He was discharged from the military after he broke his leg while training. His time in the army inspired Abshire to write the crooner song \"Service Blues\", which the newspaper Daily World reported as \"one of his most memorable tearjerkers\"; in \"Service Blues\", \"Abshire crooned about waiting alone at the train station, set to leave all that he loved in Louisiana\".Abshire moved to Basile, Louisiana after his time in the war and he performed at the Avalon Club often. His better known record titled \"Pine Grove Blues\" was released in 1949, a song based on Amede Breaux's \"Le Blues de Petit Chien\", as well as several releases on Swallow Records and Arhoolie Records during the 1960s.  He appeared with Dewey Balfa and The Balfa Brothers at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964. Abshire's music became more well known outside of Louisiana at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival. Along with Balfa, Abshire devoted much of his time in the 1960s and 70s to promoting Cajun music through appearances at festivals, colleges, and schools throughout the United States.At some point, Abshire received an offer to perform with Hank Williams (he declined). In 1970, Abshire played with the Balfa Brothers at the University of Iowa in Iowa City , Iowa. It was their first tour and they wanted to \"prove that Cajun music still exists - in its traditional form - and to save what's left\".Abshire was unable to write so he was unable to sign autographs, resulting in him having to politely decline the requests. Despite thoughts of Abshire being \"arrogant or stuck-up\" for not signing autographs, he was unable to read and write. Abshire considered his inability to do those things as frustrating and humiliating. Abshire learned how to write a signature from Barry Jean Ancelet and his signature used \"stick figure letters\" to sign \"N A\". Abshire also used the signature for legal documents.Despite receiving more income from music than the majority of Cajun musicians, Abshire was not able to entirely depend on that income to live on.

Abshire's funeral service was held at St. Augustine Catholic Church in Basile. He was buried in the church's cemetery. Abshire said prior to his death, \"When I die, I wish they would break all my records and not play them anymore. It doesn't feel right for the radios and everyone to keep on playing a musician's music after he's gone.\" Abshire also wanted his music to be buried with him, but that never happened. A benefit was held for Abshire's family on June 28, 1981, in which multiple Cajun musicians performed. A benefit dance was held at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Basile and the musicians that played during the dance changed each hour.In September 1981, a commemorative print of Abshire performing live was sold in The Kinder Courier News. There were 350 pen and ink prints available that could be framed. The Louisiana newspaper Basile Weekly said in 1983, \"Despite the efforts of many this great Cajun musician fell short of receiving the recognition and credit due him for his contributions to Cajun music and the preservation of our Acadian Culture\". A tribute was held for Abshire on August 21, 1983, in Basile, Louisiana at the city park. Performers played music during the tribute. Basile mayor Joe Toups proclaimed August 21, 1983 as Nathan Abshire day for his work in preserving Acadian culture.

Their music was initially grounded in the rock of the 1960s, especially the acid rock and psychedelic rock movements. The band played Donovan's \"Get Thy Bearings\" in concert, and were known to play the Beatles' \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" in their rehearsals. However, for their own compositions, King Crimson (unlike the rock bands that had come before them) largely stripped away the blues-based foundations of rock music and replaced them with influences derived from classical composers. The first incarnation of King Crimson played the Mars section of Gustav Holst's suite The Planets live and later the band used Mars as a foundation for the song \"Devil's Triangle\". As a result of this influence, In the Court of the Crimson King is frequently viewed as the nominal starting point of the progressive rock movements. King Crimson also initially displayed strong jazz influences, most obviously on its signature track \"21st Century Schizoid Man\". The band also drew on English folk music for compositions such as \"Moonchild\" and \"I Talk to the Wind.\" In the 1972 lineup, Fripp's intention was to combine the music of Jimi Hendrix, Igor Stravinsky and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k.The 1981 reunion of the band brought in even more elements, displaying the influence of funk, post-punk, new wave, gamelan music and late 20th century classical composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley. For its 1994 reunion, King Crimson reassessed both the mid-1970s and 1980s approaches in the light of new technology, intervening music forms such as electronica, drum'n'bass and techno; and further developments in industrial music, as well as expanding the band's ambient textural content via Fripp's Soundscapes looping approach.\nThe 2013 version of the band returned, for the most part, to the band's 1960s and 1970s influences and repertoire but addressed them via current technology and rearrangements suited to a larger ensemble of more experienced musicians, while also incorporating the New Standard Tuning used by Fripp since 1984.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40224", "text": "King Crimson have been influential both on the early 1970s progressive rock movement and numerous contemporary artists. Genesis and Yes were directly influenced by the band's usage of the mellotron, and many King Crimson band members were involved in other notable bands: Bruford in Yes; Lake in Emerson, Lake & Palmer; McDonald in Foreigner; Burrell in Bad Company, and Wetton in U.K. and Asia. Canadian rock band Rush's drummer Neil Peart credited the adventurous and innovative style of Michael Giles as an influence on his own approach to percussion.King Crimson's influence extends to many bands from diverse genres, especially of the 1990s and 2000s. Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana, had stated that the album Red had a major influence on the sound of their final studio album In Utero. Tool are known to be heavily influenced by King Crimson, with vocalist Maynard James Keenan joking on a tour with them: \"Now you know who we ripped off. Just don't tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson.\" Modern progressive, experimental, psychedelic and indie rock bands have cited them as an influence as well, including the Mars Volta, Primus, Mystery Jets, Fanfarlo, Phish, and Anekdoten, who first practiced together playing King Crimson songs. Steven Wilson, the leader of Porcupine Tree, was responsible for remixing King Crimson's back catalogue in surround sound and said that the process had an enormous influence on his solo albums, and his band was influenced by King Crimson. In November 2012 the Flaming Lips in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs released a track-by-track reinterpretation of In the Court of the Crimson King entitled Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn. Colin Newman, of Wire, said he saw King Crimson perform many times, and that they influenced him deeply. The seminal hardcore punk group Black Flag acknowledge Wetton-era King Crimson as an influence on their experimental period in the mid-1980s. Melvin Gibbs said that the Rollins Band was influenced most by King Crimson, using similar chords. Bad Religion cites the lyrics of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" on their single \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\" and the name of their record label, Epitaph (founded by their guitarist Brett Gurewitz), comes from the song of the same name on Crimson's debut album. Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid considered Robert Fripp as one of his guitar influences.King Crimson have frequently been cited as pioneers of progressive metal and as an influence on bands of this genre, including Opeth, Mastodon, Between the Buried and Me, Leprous, Haken, the Ocean, Caligula's Horse, Last Chance to Reason, and Indukti. Members of metal bands Mudvayne, Voivod, Enslaved, Yob, Pyrrhon, and Pallbearer have cited King Crimson as an influence. Heavy experimental and avant-garde acts like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Neurosis, Zeni Geva, Ancestors, and Oranssi Pazuzu all cite King Crimson's influence.\nOther artists affected by King Crimson include video game composer Nobuo Uematsu, noise music artist Masami Akita of Merzbow, jazz guitarist Dennis Rea of Land, folktronica exponent Juana Molina, hip hop producer RJD2, hip hop and soul composer Adrian Younge, film director Hal Hartley, and folk-pop singer Ian Kelly.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40222", "text": "King Crimson were  an English progressive rock band formed in 1968 in London. The band drew inspiration from a wide variety of music, incorporating elements of classical, jazz, folk, heavy metal, gamelan, blues, industrial, electronic, experimental music and new wave. They exerted a strong influence on the early 1970s progressive rock movement, including on contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis, and continue to inspire subsequent generations of artists across multiple genres. The band earned a large cult following.Founded by Robert Fripp, Michael Giles, Greg Lake, Ian McDonald and Peter Sinfield, the band initially focused on a dramatic sound layered with Mellotron, McDonald's saxophone and flute, and Lake's bass and powerful lead vocals. Their debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969), remains their most commercially successful and influential release, with a potent mixture of jazz, classical and experimental music. Following the sudden simultaneous departures of McDonald and Giles, with Lake also leaving very shortly afterwards, the next two albums In the Wake of Poseidon and Lizard (both 1970) were recorded during a period of instability in the band's line-up. A settled band of Fripp, Sinfield, Mel Collins, Boz Burrell and Ian Wallace recorded Islands in 1971, though in mid-1972, Fripp let go of this line-up and changed the group's instrumentation and approach, drawing from European free improvisation and developing ever more complex compositions. With Bill Bruford, John Wetton, David Cross and, briefly, Jamie Muir, they reached what some saw as a creative peak on Larks' Tongues in Aspic (1973), Starless and Bible Black (1974), and Red (1974). King Crimson disbanded at the end of 1974.\nAfter seven years of inactivity, King Crimson was reborn in 1981 with another change in musical direction. The new band comprised Fripp, Bruford and new members Adrian Belew and Tony Levin. They drew influence from African music, gamelan, post-punk and New York minimalism. This band lasted three years, resulting in the trio of albums Discipline (1981), Beat (1982) and Three of a Perfect Pair (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, they reformed in 1994, adding Pat Mastelotto and Trey Gunn for a sextet line-up Fripp called \"The Double Trio\". The double trio participated in another three-year cycle of activity that included the release of Thrak (1995), and multiple concert recordings. There was a hiatus between 1997 and 2000. Four members of the double trio reunited in 2000 as a more industrial-oriented King Crimson, called \"The Double Duo\", releasing The Construkction of Light (2000) and The Power to Believe (2003). After a five-year hiatus, the group expanded (in the person of new second drummer Gavin Harrison) for a 2008 tour celebrating the 40th anniversary of their 1968 formation.\nFollowing another hiatus (2009\u20132012), during which Fripp was thought to be retired, King Crimson came together again in 2013; this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline, and new second guitarist and singer Jakko Jakszyk.

He returned to Paris in 1970.In Saint-Tropez he met French music producer Eddie Barclay, who allowed him to record a first single in 1971. He wrote \"Le Lundi au soleil\", sung by Claude Fran\u00e7ois. Later, Juvet began collaborating with French composer and musician Jean-Michel Jarre with this new material featured on Juvet's album, Love, which was released in 1973. Juvet represented Switzerland at the Eurovision Song Contest 1973 with \"Je vais me marier, Marie,\" placing at no. 12 in the competition.In 1977, Juvet collaborated again with Jarre on the French-language album, Paris by Night, which featured the hit song, \"O\u00f9 sont les femmes?\" In 1978, he worked with noted disco producers Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo, who also produced Village People and The Ritchie Family, among other acts. As a result, Juvet soon experienced international success with the disco tracks, \"Got a Feeling\" and \"I Love America\".In 1978, the aforementioned \"O\u00f9 sont les femmes?\" was re-recorded in English under the title, \"Where Is My Woman?\", and was featured on Juvet's English-language debut on Casablanca Records in the U.S. Victor Willis, original lead singer of Village People, was the lyricist for the project.His soundtrack score to David Hamilton's art house film Laura featured disco musicians Marc Chantereau and Slim Pezin of Voyage and Space session bassist Jannick Top. Although the music from Laura was never released on compact disc and was never released in the United States, it nonetheless sold 650,000 copies. Parts of the music were written and produced by the New Zealander Brian Southcombe (now deceased) who was once married to Charlotte Rampling. Southcombe, David Hamilton and another New Zealander (Hamilton's business manager) were at one time actively trying to set up a sequel movie to Laura and are said to have approached Juvet for more music. \nWith the decline of disco in the early 1980s, Juvet returned to the French music scene in 1982 with the album, R\u00eaves immoraux. While selling respectably, the album failed to match Juvet's earlier commercial success. A time of financial and personal decline followed, with Juvet suffering periods of depression and alcoholism and relocating from mainland Europe to London, then to Los Angeles and finally, in the latter half of the 1980s, back to Switzerland.Juvet returned to Paris in 1991 and to his roots as a singer-songwriter with the album, Solitudes. The disc featured more personal, emotional songs with Juvet being accompanied by French-language performers, Fran\u00e7oise Hardy, Luc Plamondon, and Marc Lavoine.In 2005, Juvet released his autobiography Les bleus au c\u0153ur: Souvenirs (\"Bruises on My Heart: Memories\"), in which he talks about his career and his bisexuality. On 1 April 2021, it was announced that Juvet was found dead at his apartment in Barcelona, aged 70.

His childhood home was at 225 Triunvirato, later renumbered and renamed as 4943 Corrientes, opposite the theater Florencio S\u00e1nchez. Immersed since childhood in the theatrical environment and in the emerging world of radio, at fourteen he decided not to study further, a decision that earned him being thrown out of the house by his parents. He moved to El Centro area of Buenos Aires.\nLinking his fate to that of Carlos Gardel began in 1933 when he was presented as a performance artist speaker at the Nacional theater. In 1934, Nelson began broadcasting his Buenos Aires radio program \"Escuche esta Noche a Gardel\" (\"Listen tonight to Gardel\"), trying to keep alive the public's interest in Gardel, who was killed on June 24, 1935 in an accidental airplane crash in Medell\u00edn.  \nSoon after, on Radio Callao, opened in January of that year, the announcer Carlos Enrique Cecchetti began broadcasting a program fully devoted to Gardel. Nelson continued that program beginning in 1936, inaugurating the show \"El Bronce que Sonr\u00ede\" (\"The smiling bronze\"). This program moved in 1944 to Radio Mitre. Each daily program started with this saying: \"Through time and distance his name endures as the truest symbol of our arts. Carlos Gardel, the smiling bronze.\" Gardel's remains were returned from Colombia on 5 February 1936. Nelson broadcast a program from Gardel's gravesite in Chacarita Cemetery.\nAnother day radio program which gave Nelson great popularity was \"El Exito de Cada Orquesta\" (The Success of Every Orchestra), which was broadcast from Radio Callao (the station that also directed \"La Pandilla Coraz\u00f3n\") and then transferred to Radio Mitre and finally Radio Rivadavia. Knowing the value of ritual formulae, Nelson concluded each program with the same farewell: \"See you tomorrow, if God permits.\" Both programs remained stubbornly on the air long after radio stations had started to thin out their tango programming.\nIn 1936, he married Margarita Ibarrola Isaurralde when she was 17, but they separated in 1945, leaving his 7-year-old son, Julio Carlos (nicknamed \"Cachito\") with the boy's paternal grandparents. Margarita migrated to Brazil, where she married a German and had two children with him but again separated. Eventually all contact was lost. \nJulio then married Susana Carballo in 1951; she was a female tango singer known as Susana Ocampo. That marriage lasted only a year and half. They separated then, but no formal divorce. After Nelson's death, Susana became his heir.\nOne day, at age 14, Nelson's son escaped from the grandparents' house, leaving a letter in which he explained to them that he was going south. The truth was that he was going to Guayaquil, Ecuador with two friends. In Bolivia, they were arrested, but managed to continue traveling on a group passport. Nelson's son found employment at Club Barcelona. At that time, Tucho M\u00e9ndez, a friend of Julio Jorge and aware of the disappearance of Julio's child, recognized his son with great surprise. He immediately phoned Buenos Aires, and shortly after, via a link to a radio Guayaquil, Julio, asked the son to come back home. His son returned.\nJulio died on 6 March 1976, aged 62, four days after suffering a heart attack.\nJulio Jorge Nelson wrote several tangos that enjoyed success. By far, the most successful was \"Margarita Gauthier\" with music by the talented Joaqu\u00edn Mora. This tango was recorded by Alberto G\u00f3mez in 1935, but truly became famous due to the  version of Miguel Cal\u00f3 with Raul Beron, in 1942, which was followed by An\u00edbal Troilo with Fiorentino, in 1943.  \nNelson was also the author of the tangos \"Carriego\u201d, \u201c\u00d3yeme, mam\u00e1\u201d, \u201cQu\u00e9 ser\u00e1 de ti\u201d, \u201cNo debemos retornar\u201d, \u201cNocturno de tango\u201d, \u201cLa casa vac\u00eda\u201d, \u201cEscuchando tu voz\u201d, \u201cAl volverte a ver\u201d, \u201cJunto al piano\u201d, \u201cCuento azul\u201d, and \u201cDerrotao\u201d, among others. \nNelson also had two forays into film, \"Historia de un \u00cddolo\" and \"Soy del Tiempo de Gardel\", about a time which he more than anyone else celebrated.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_36428", "text": "Henrique George Mautner (born January 17, 1941), better known by his stage name Jorge Mautner, is a Brazilian singer-songwriter, lyricist, violinist, actor, screenwriter, film director and poet, considered to be a pioneer of the MPB scene and of the Tropicalista movement.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23490", "text": "Band of Brothers is the 63rd studio album by country music singer-songwriter Willie Nelson.

Shots are performed by pressing one, or both, of the two main buttons (A or B), which make the ball spin in different ways. Pressing a button twice strikes the tennis shot with more power and spin. Additionally, pressing the two buttons in a different order can result in a different type of shot altogether, such as a lob or drop shot. Both buttons can be pressed at the same time to hit a very powerful smash shot. The longer a button is pressed before contact is made with the ball, the stronger the shot will be. The control system allows players of all levels to become familiar with the mechanics of the game within a very short time, whilst also encouraging advanced players to take advantage of the variety of shots offered to come up with different strategies for winning points. A total of seven types of shot are possible using only the two main buttons of the controller. These gameplay mechanics were later brought to the newer games of the Mario Tennis series.\nMarking the sixth Mario game for the Nintendo 64, Mario Tennis brought eleven new characters to the Mario Tennis franchise, including Waluigi (who made his first appearance in this game), Princess Daisy, Wario, Shy Guy, Donkey Kong and Birdo.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40306", "text": "Mario Tennis received critical acclaim, with critics citing the accessibility and depth of the controls as being very impressive.

Worrell was later replaced by various other bassists, including Reggie Workman, Finn Von Eyben, Harold Dodson, Eddie G\u00f3mez, Steve Swallow, and Buell Neidlinger. All About Jazz reviewer Clifford Allen wrote that the group \"cut some of the most powerful music in the free jazz underground\".In November 1962, Tchicai moved from his home country of Denmark to New York City at the suggestion of Archie Shepp and Bill Dixon, whom he had met at the Helsinki Jazz Festival earlier that year. Upon arriving in New York, Tchicai began playing with Dixon's group, which included Shepp and Roswell Rudd among others, and also sat in with Don Cherry and various other musicians. By the summer of 1963, Tchicai, Shepp, and Cherry had formed the New York Contemporary Five with bassist Don Moore and drummer J. C. Moses, while Rudd, with Shepp, continued to play with Dixon. According to Rudd, the idea of forming a new quartet originated with Tchicai, and the two began playing in filmmaker Michael Snow's loft space with Moore and Moses. Moses soon left as a result of mutual dissatisfaction with his role, and Rudd and Tchicai were soon introduced to drummer Milford Graves by saxophonist Giuseppi Logan. Tchicai recalled: \"this was a very pleasant surprise and more than that, because Graves simply baffled both Rudd and I in that we, at that time, hadn't heard anybody of the younger musicians in New York that had the same sense of rhythmic cohesion in poly-rhythmics or the same sense of intensity and musicality.\" Graves \"wound up playing with them for half an hour, astonishing Rudd and Tchicai, who promptly invited him to join what became The New York Art Quartet\".

However, Tchicai also recalled that \"bassist Don Moore became so frightened of this wizard of a percussionist that he decided that this couldn't be true or possible and, therefore, refused to play with us\", and the group brought in bassist Lewis Worrell in his place.In July 1964, Tchicai and Rudd briefly joined Albert Ayler's quartet, which consisted of Ayler, Cherry, Gary Peacock, and Sunny Murray, to record New York Eye and Ear Control, the soundtrack for a film by Michael Snow. That fall, the NYAQ, calling themselves \"The John Tchicai Quartet\", played their debut concert, participating in the \"October Revolution in Jazz\" organized by Bill Dixon. In November, the NYAQ recorded their first album as part of ESP Disk's original roster of jazz artists, and a month later they performed at the Dixon-organized festival \"Four Days in December\" as the \"Roswell Rudd - John Tchicai Quartet\", playing opposite Sun Ra at Judson Hall. The group's second album, Mohawk, was recorded in July 1965 with Reggie Workman on bass (Worrell left the group in December 1964), and was released on the Fontana label. In the fall of 1965, Tchicai lined up dates for the NYAQ in Copenhagen, Gothenburg (Sweden), Hilversum (Holland), and Amsterdam (where they opened for Ornette Coleman's group), with Finn Von Eyben playing bass and Louis Moholo playing drums as a result of scheduling issues with the original musicians. Recordings from this tour were issued on Roswell Rudd, released in 1971 without Rudd's consent, and in 2010 on the album Old Stuff. The group broke up in February 1966, with Tchicai returning to Denmark.On June 13, 1999, the NYAQ, with Workman on bass, reunited for a performance at the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, opening for Sonic Youth. Amiri Baraka, whose poem \"Black Dada Nihilismus\" was included on their debut album 35 years earlier, also appeared. The group recorded the album 35th Reunion  the following day. In 2000 they played the Paris Banlieues Blues Festival, followed by a performance at the Lisboa festival in 2001. In 2013, after Tchicai's death, Triple Point Records released a limited-edition five-LP box set, along with a 156-page coffee-table book and miscellaneous artifacts, entitled Call It Art.According to Tchicai, one of the most unique aspects of the NYAQ was \"the polyphonic part of the music that came into play; the whole collective style of playing that also existed in New Orleans Jazz and classical music. The polyphonic aspect of our music was something quite new compared to what other people were doing in contemporary jazz.\" David Toop described the group's signature sound as \"deliberately ragged, bleary themes tumbling out in spasms, notes tailing away as if lost to daydream, the music so open that total collapse seems perpetually imminent\". In his liner notes to Mohawk, Tchicai wrote: \"The important thing about our music is that it must be heard and listened to without preconceived ideas as to how jazz should sound \u2013 listen to it as MUSIC and let that be the only label!\"A documentary on the NYAQ, entitled The Breath Courses Through Us, was released in 2013 by director Alan Roth.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_54918", "text": "New York Days is an album by Italian jazz trumpeter and composer Enrico Rava recorded in February 2008 and released on ECM the following year.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "740_18910", "text": "The Candles are an American rock band formed in New York City in 2009.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "740_16956", "text": "Madison Park is an American electronica duo composed of husband and wife James and DeAnna Cool.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "740_18236", "text": "The Moshe Hecht Band is an American Hasidic folk rock band based in Brooklyn, New York.

His compositions include songs, solo piano works, chamber music, choral pieces, operas, ballets, and orchestral concert music. Among the best-known are the piano suite Trois mouvements perp\u00e9tuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champ\u00eatre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the Organ Concerto (1938), the opera Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites (1957), and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir, and orchestra.\nAs the only son of a prosperous manufacturer, Poulenc was expected to follow his father into the family firm, and he was not allowed to enrol at a music college. He studied with the pianist Ricardo Vi\u00f1es, who became his mentor after the composer's parents died. Poulenc also made the acquaintance of Erik Satie, under whose tutelage he became one of a group of young composers known collectively as Les Six. In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence. During the 1930s a much more serious side to his nature emerged, particularly in the religious music he composed from 1936 onwards, which he alternated with his more light-hearted works.\nIn addition to his work as a composer, Poulenc was an accomplished pianist. He was particularly celebrated for his performing partnerships with the baritone Pierre Bernac (who also advised him in vocal writing) and the soprano Denise Duval.  He toured in Europe and America with both of them, and made a number of recordings as a pianist. He was among the first composers to see the importance of the gramophone, and he recorded extensively from 1928 onwards.\nIn his later years, and for decades after his death, Poulenc had a reputation, particularly in his native country, as a humorous, lightweight composer, and his religious music was often overlooked. In the 21st century, more attention has been given to his serious works, with many new productions of Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites and La voix humaine worldwide, and numerous live and recorded performances of his songs and choral music.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40538", "text": "Poulenc's music is essentially diatonic. In Henri Hell's view, this is because the main feature of Poulenc's musical art is his melodic gift. In the words of Roger Nichols in the Grove dictionary, \"For [Poulenc] the most important element of all was melody and he found his way to a vast treasury of undiscovered tunes within an area that had, according to the most up-to-date musical maps, been surveyed, worked and exhausted.\" The commentator George Keck writes, \"His melodies are simple, pleasing, easily remembered, and most often emotionally expressive.\"Poulenc said that he was not inventive in his harmonic language. The composer Lennox Berkeley wrote of him, \"All through his life, he was content to use conventional harmony, but his use of it was so individual, so immediately recognizable as his own, that it gave his music freshness and validity.\"  Keck considers Poulenc's harmonic language \"as beautiful, interesting and personal as his melodic writing ... clear, simple harmonies moving in obviously defined tonal areas with chromaticism that is rarely more than passing\". Poulenc had no time for musical theories; in one of his many radio interviews he called for \"a truce to composing by theory, doctrine, rule!\" He was dismissive of what he saw as the dogmatism of latter-day adherents to dodecaphony, led by Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz, and greatly regretted that the adoption of a theoretical approach had affected the music of Olivier Messiaen, of whom he had earlier had high hopes. To Hell, almost all Poulenc's music is \"directly or indirectly inspired by the purely melodic associations of the human voice\". Poulenc was a painstaking craftsman, though a myth grew up \u2013 \"la l\u00e9gende de facilit\u00e9\" \u2013 that his music came easily to him; he commented, \"The myth is excusable, since I do everything to conceal my efforts.\"The pianist Pascal Rog\u00e9 commented in 1999 that both sides of Poulenc's musical nature were equally important: \"You must accept him as a whole. If you take away either part, the serious or the non-serious, you destroy him. If one part is erased you get only a pale photocopy of what he really is.\" Poulenc recognised the dichotomy, but in all his works he wanted music that was \"healthy, clear and robust \u2013 music as frankly French as Stravinsky's is Slav\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40539", "text": "The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, \"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perp\u00e9tuels.\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites and Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias.\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

It contains a sample of Clash's song \"Straight to Hell\". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, it is written in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 86 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of D major while M.I.A.'s vocal range spans one octave, from the low-note of F\u266f3 to the high-note of F\u266f4. The musical composition incorporates verse-chorus form, with a bridge preceding the fourth and final chorus, where a distorted guitar riff provides accompaniment to the piece playing out the coda. The chorus features children chanting and singing, and sound effects of gunshots and a cash register, and was compared to the chorus on Wreckx-N-Effect's 1992 song \"Rump Shaker\". BBC Radio 1's Fraser McAlpine commented on the discordance between M.I.A.'s \"icy, distant\" vocals and the \"calm and serene\" backing track.The lyrics, epitomising Kala's central theme, satirise American perceptions of visa-seeking foreigners and immigrants from Third World nations.

He was among the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades and several eras in the history of jazz. He received numerous accolades including the Grammy Award for Best Male Vocal Performance for Hello, Dolly! in 1965, as well as a posthumous win for the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972, and induction into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2017.Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. Around 1922, he followed his mentor, Joe \"King\" Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. He earned a reputation at \"cutting contests\", and his fame reached band leader Fletcher Henderson. He moved to New York City, where he became a featured and musically influential band soloist and recording artist. By the 1950s, he was a national musical icon, appearing regularly in radio and television broadcasts and on film.\nHis best known songs include \"What a Wonderful World\", \"La Vie en Rose\", \"Hello, Dolly!\", \"On the Sunny Side of the Street\", \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\", \"When You're Smiling\" and \"When the Saints Go Marching In\". He collaborated with Ella Fitzgerald, producing three records together: Ella and Louis (1956), Ella and Louis Again (1957), and Porgy and Bess (1959). He also appeared in films such as A Rhapsody in Black and Blue (1932), Cabin in the Sky (1943), High Society (1956), Paris Blues (1961), A Man Called Adam (1966), and Hello, Dolly! (1969).\nWith his instantly recognizable rich, gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser. He was also skilled at scat singing. By the end of Armstrong's life, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\" to wide popularity with White and international audiences. He rarely publicly discussed racial issues, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation in the Little Rock crisis. He was able to access the upper echelons of American society at a time when this was difficult for Black men.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_53800", "text": "Louis Armstrong \u2013 trumpet, vocals\nTrummy Young \u2013 trombone\nBarney Bigard \u2013 clarinet\nBilly Kyle \u2013 piano\nArvell Shaw \u2013 double bass\nBarrett Deems \u2013 drums\nVelma Middleton \u2013 vocalsProduction\n\nGeorge Avakian \u2013 producer, engineer, liner notes, reissue producer\nMark Wilder \u2013 engineer, digital mastering\nSeth Rothstein \u2013 project director, project manager\nRene Arsenault \u2013 production assistant\nCozbi Sanchez-Cabrera \u2013 art direction, reissue art director\nSteven Berkowitz \u2013 reissue series\nKevin Gore \u2013 reissue series\nRandall Martin \u2013 reissue design\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_37383", "text": "Larry Clinton (August 17, 1909  \u2013  May 2, 1985) was an American musician, best known as a trumpeter who became a prominent American bandleader and arranger.His jazz and pop standards were \"The Dipsy Doodle\" (1937), \"My Reverie\" (1938), and \"Heart and Soul\" (1939).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40665", "text": "Armstrong appeared in more than a dozen Hollywood films, usually playing a bandleader or musician.

In 1947, he played himself in the movie New Orleans opposite Billie Holiday, which chronicled the demise of the Storyville district and the ensuing exodus of musicians from New Orleans to Chicago. In the 1959 film The Five Pennies, Armstrong played himself, sang, and played several classic numbers.

{"id": "136_483", "question": "What type of music does Whisky Galore! play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_40835", "text": "Whisky Galore! is a 1949 British comedy film produced by Ealing Studios, starring Basil Radford, Bruce Seton, Joan Greenwood and Gordon Jackson. It was the directorial debut of Alexander Mackendrick; the screenplay was by Compton Mackenzie, an adaptation of his 1947 novel Whisky Galore, and Angus MacPhail. The story\u2014based on a true event, the running aground of the SS Politician\u2014concerns a shipwreck off a fictional Scottish island, the inhabitants of which have run out of whisky because of wartime rationing. The islanders find out the ship is carrying 50,000 cases of whisky, some of which they salvage, against the opposition of the local Customs and Excise men.\nIt was filmed on the island of Barra; the weather was so poor that the production over-ran its 10-week schedule by five weeks, and the film went \u00a320,000 over budget. Michael Balcon, the head of the studio, was unimpressed by the initial cut of the film, and one of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added footage and re-edited the film before its release. Like other Ealing comedies, Whisky Galore! explores the actions of a small insular group facing and overcoming a more powerful opponent. An unspoken sense of community runs through the film, and the story reflects a time when the British Empire was weakening.\nWhisky Galore! was well received on release. It came out in the same year as Passport to Pimlico and Kind Hearts and Coronets, leading to 1949 being remembered as one of the peak years of the Ealing comedies. In the US, where Whisky Galore! was renamed Tight Little Island, the film became the first from the studios to achieve box office success. It was followed by a sequel, Rockets Galore!. Whisky Galore! has since been adapted for the stage, and a remake was released in 2016.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "407_6370", "text": "All music written, composed & arranged by Aunty Disco Project.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40837", "text": "Whisky Galore! primarily centres on the conflict between two men, Macroon and Waggett; women have what McArthur describes as \"peripheral roles\". Much of the film's humour is at the expense of Waggett, and the film historian Mark Duguid considers there is a \"cruel bite\" to it. Waggett is described by the cultural historian Roger Rawlings as a fish-out-of-water on Todday; he is the intruder in a film that contains what the film historian Christine Geraghty describes as \"a narrative of rural resistance\". Not all outsiders to the island are intruders: the other Englishman, Sergeant Odd, \"acts as the audience's entry point into the community\", and immerses himself in the island's ways. Whisky Galore! is one of several films that show an outsider coming to Scotland and being \"either humiliated or rejuvenated (or both)\", according to David Martin-Jones, the film historian.Jonny Murray, the film and visual culture academic, considers the Scottish characters in the film as stereotypes: \"the slightly drunk, slightly unruly local, the figures who are magically cut adrift or don't seem to respect at all the conventions of how we live in the modern world\". He likens the film's portrayals of the Scots to the portrayals in the Kailyard school of literature, which represents a false image of Scotland. The film historian Claire Mortimer sees the Western Isles as portrayed as \"being a magical space which is outside of time and the 'real' world\". This is true of both Whisky Galore! and Mackendrick's other Scottish-based Ealing comedy, The Maggie. Both films evoke \"a tension between myth and reality in the portrayal of the idyllic island community\".McArthur, in his work comparing Whisky Galore! to The Maggie, identifies what he sees as \"the Scottish Discursive Unconscious\" running through the film: an examination of the ethnicity of \"the Scots (in particular the Gaelic-Speaking, Highland Scots) as having an essential identity different from\u2014indeed, in many respects the antithesis of\u2014the Anglo-Saxon identified by (a certain class of) Englishmen\". According to McArthur, this view of the Scots has permeated much of British culture, influenced by Sir Walter Scott, Felix Mendelssohn, James Macpherson, Sir Edwin Landseer, Sir Harry Lauder and Queen Victoria. The critic John Brown argues that the film, created by outsiders to the community, tries to \"embody some kind of definitive essence\", but fails to do so, although the result is not unsympathetic.According to Daubney, the islanders \"relish their isolation and simple way of life and go to considerable lengths to protect it against a moral code imposed from outside\". An unspoken sense of community runs through the film, according to Geraghty, such as in salvaging the whisky, and particularly in the r\u00e8iteach scene; immediately coming from that celebration, the islanders come together to hide the whisky when they hear the customs men are on their way. Martin-Jones\u2014describing the scene as a c\u00e8ilidh\u2014considers that it offers a Kailyard image which \"illustrates the curative charms Scotland offers to the tourist or visiting outsider\".Mackendrick's biographer, Philip Kemp, identifies different strands of comedy, including what he describes as \"crude incongruity\", \"verbal fencing\u2014beautifully judged by the actors no less than the director in its underplayed humour\" and \"near-surreal\" conversations. Martin-Jones sees such flexibility in approach as a method to allow important points in the plot to make themselves apparent.The film historians Anthony Aldgate and Jeffrey Richards describe Whisky Galore! as a progressive comedy because it upsets the established social order to promote the well-being of a community. In this, and in the rejection of the colonial power by a small community, Aldgate and Richards compare the film to Passport to Pimlico. The device of pitting a small group of British against a series of changes to the status quo from an external agent leads the British Film Institute to consider Whisky Galore!, along with other of the Ealing comedies, as \"conservative, but 'mildly anarchic' daydreams, fantasies\". Like other Ealing comedies, Whisky Galore! concerned the actions of a small insular group facing and overcoming a more powerful opponent. The film historian George Perry writes that in doing so the film examines \"dogged team spirit, the idiosyncrasies of character blended and harnessed for the good of the group\". Like Passport to Pimlico, Whisky Galore! \"portrays a small populace closing ranks around their esoteric belief system that English law cannot completely contain\".

Much of the influence is because of the Kailyard effect used in Whisky Galore!, according to the author Auslan Cramb.Whisky Galore! was produced at the same time as Passport to Pimlico and Kind Hearts and Coronets; all three comedies were released in UK cinemas over two months. Brian McFarlane, writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, states that although it was not an aim of releasing the three films together, together they \"established the brand name of 'Ealing comedy'\"; Duguid writes that the three films \"forever linked 'Ealing' and 'comedy' in the public imagination\". The film historians Duguid, Lee Freeman, Keith Johnston and Melanie Williams consider 1949 was one of two \"pinnacle\" years for Ealing, the other being 1951, when The Man in the White Suit and The Lavender Hill Mob were both released.In 2009 Whisky Galore! was adapted for the stage as a musical; under the direction of Ken Alexander, it was performed at the Pitlochry Festival Theatre. In June 2016 a remake of the film was premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival; Eddie Izzard played Waggett and Gregor Fisher took the role of Macroon. The critic Guy Lodge, writing for Variety, thought it an \"innocuous, unmemorable remake\" and that there was \"little reason for it to exist\". In contrast, Kate Muir, writing in The Times thought \"the gentle, subversive wit of the 1949 version has been left intact\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40838", "text": "Whisky Galore! was released into UK cinemas on 16 June 1949 and was financially successful. In France, the film was retitled Whisky \u00e0 gogo; the name was later used as that of a discoth\u00e8que in Paris. Whisky Galore! was released in the US in December 1949, though because of restrictions on the use of the names of alcoholic drinks in titles, the film was renamed Tight Little Island. The film was given an open certification in most territories, allowing people of all ages to see it, but in Denmark it was restricted to adults only. The Danish censor explained \"There is in this film an obvious disregard for ordinary legislation, in this case the law against smuggling ... Also, we believed that it was damaging for children to see alcohol portrayed as an absolute necessity for normal self-expression\".Critics warmly praised Whisky Galore! on its release. C. A. Lejeune, writing in The Observer, considered it \"a film with the French genius in the British manner\"; the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought the film was \"put together with ... tact and subtlety\", and Henry Raynor, in Sight & Sound magazine, called it \"one of the best post-war British films\". Several critics identified the script as excellent and The Manchester Guardian's reviewer thought that the main credit for the film should be given to Mackenzie and MacPhail for the story. Lejeune thought that the story was treated \"with the sort of fancy that is half childlike and half agelessly wise: it accepts facts for what they are and only tilts their representation, ever so slightly, towards the fantastic and the humorous\".The acting was also praised by many critics; Lejeune wrote that the actors portray \"real people doing real things under real conditions\", and the reviewer for The Monthly Film Bulletin considered that \"a talented cast sees to it that no island character study shall go unnoticed\", while the lead roles \"make the most of their opportunities\". The critic for The Manchester Guardian considered Radford to have played his part \"with unusual subtlety\" and thought that among the remainder of the cast \"there are so many excellent performances that it would be unfair to pick out two or three names for special praise\". The critic Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, thought that Radford and Watson were the stand-out actors of the film, although he also considered the rest of the cast strong.The film surprised many at Ealing Studios for the level of popularity it gained in the US, where it became Ealing's first to achieve box office success. For Crowther, \"the charm and distinction of this film reside in the wonderfully dry way it spins a deliciously wet tale\". T. M. P. in The New York Times wrote that the film was \"another happy demonstration of that peculiar knack British movie makers have for striking a rich and universally appealing comic vein in the most unexpected and seemingly insular situations\".Whisky Galore! was nominated for the British Academy Film Award for Best British Film, alongside Passport to Pimlico and Kind Hearts and Coronets, although they lost to The Third Man (1949).", "hasanswer": false}]}

The band's members expressed a fascination with vampires and anything connected to them, earning themselves and their music the title \"vampiric metal\" from their contemporaries.

These include Vampyria III in London in 1999, Gods of Metal in Italy in 2000, Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig in 2003 and 2006, Gotham in London in 2004, and Female Voices Festival in Wieze, Belgium in 2006.\nIn 2003, the band toured with Christian Death throughout Europe, and recorded an album with Valor of Christian Death and Gian Pyres of Cradle of Filth as special guests.\nSince 2004, Sonya Scarlet has remained the solo vocalist and front of the band, replacing her previous role as backing vocals.\nScarlet sometimes cuts herself with razors at performances, freely letting fans drink her blood.

European distributors bought the album and it was published with permission in Europe, South America, the US, Russia, and Japan.\nOn 19 March 2007, they released the double CD Desire of Damnation, with live songs from The Addiction Tour 2006 and some new studio songs and remixes.\nGuitarist Robert Cufaro (\"Morgoth\") left the band in 2006 and was replaced by Stephan Benfante.\nIn May 2008, Aural Music released the album Anima Noir.\nOn 14 January 2011, Aural Music released the album Moonlight Waltz.\nMoonlight Waltz was the ninth studio album.

Jose Otero from IGN praised the game for \"appeal[ing] to the nostalgia of long-time Nintendo fans\" while also being \"accessible to new players\". Thomas Schulenberg of Joystiq criticized occasional \"matches plagued with stuttering frame rates\" during online play and discussed his \"indifference toward the Amiibo experience\" but praised the game for its \"abundance of goals to chase\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40901", "text": "Like in previous games in the series, Super Smash Bros. is a multiplayer platform fighter where players use various attacks, techniques, and items to deal damage to their opponents and knock them out of the arena. As a character's damage percentage increases, they fly back further when attacked, and may eventually be knocked far enough out of the playing field to be knocked out. To assist players during a battle, items sometimes appear on the battlefield, most of which represent the various video games represented in the series. An item called a Smash Ball allows players to use a powerful, character-specific attack known as a \"Final Smash\". Another item is an Assist Trophy, which summons various non-playable characters from a represented series onto the field to assist the summoner. Like its predecessors, Super Smash Bros. features collectible in-game trophies based on characters or items seen in various Nintendo or third-party games. Each stage now features an alternate Omega form, which replaces the stage's layout with a flat surface with ledges on both sides and removes all stage hazards, similar to the stage \"Final Destination\", a flat, medium-sized stage with no hazards. Certain stages, collectible trophies, and game features are exclusive to each version, with the Wii U version primarily featuring elements taken from home console titles and the 3DS version taking elements primarily from handheld titles. Both games feature revisited stages from past entries in the series and new stages representing newly introduced properties or recent entries in existing ones.New to the series is the ability to customize both existing characters and custom Mii Fighters, altering their attacks and giving them unique power-ups. These characters can be transferred between the 3DS and Wii U versions of the game, as well as certain items earned in specific modes. Additionally, players can use Amiibo to train computer-controlled players and import them into a match. Both versions of the game support local and online multiplayer. Whereas local and online matches with friends have fully customizable rules, online matches with strangers are divided into two modes: \"For Fun\" and \"For Glory\". For Fun features random stages and items, with timed matches only and Omega stages omitted, while For Glory features stock matches with no items exclusively on Omega stages and features both standard Smash and 1-on-1 battles, all of which the player's wins and losses are recorded from For Glory. Customized characters, Mii Fighters, and Amiibo cannot be used in online matches against strangers. Additionally, solo play once again features Classic mode, which features an intensity setting directly influenced by Masahiro Sakurai's previous project Kid Icarus: Uprising, in which players can make the game more difficult by spending in-game currency to earn greater rewards. The Home-Run Contest game from Melee also returns with a competitive variation for up to four players. Both versions share two new modes. Target Blast has players beat up a ticking bomb before launching it into a set of targets, to earn as many points as possible by causing chain reactions. Trophy Rush has players clear out falling crates to build up a Fever meter and quickly earn new trophies and customization items.\nIn addition to a moderation system to prevent griefing, the game features an online ranking system called \"Global Smash Power\" for a player's solo mode score, which shows how many other players someone has outscored, rather than listing their position on a leaderboard. Although the game does not feature a ranking system for online matches, matchmaking between players of similar skill levels was introduced. Online also features Spectator Mode, where spectators can place bets on other players to win more gold, and Conquest, in which players can support selected characters by playing as them online, earning rewards if their supported team wins, and earning bonus rewards for going on a winning streak.

{"id": "136_502", "question": "What type of music does Billy Eckstine play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_40905", "text": "William Clarence Eckstine (July 8, 1914 \u2013 March 8, 1993) was an American jazz and pop singer and a bandleader during the swing and bebop eras. He was noted for his rich, almost operatic bass-baritone voice. In 2019, Eckstine was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award \"for performers who, during their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording.\" His recording of \"I Apologize\" (MGM, 1951) was given the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999. The New York Times described him as an \"influential band leader\" whose \"suave bass-baritone\" and \"full-throated, sugary approach to popular songs inspired singers like Earl Coleman, Johnny Hartman, Joe Williams, Arthur Prysock, and Lou Rawls.\"", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40907", "text": "Heading to Chicago, Illinois, Eckstine joined Earl Hines' Grand Terrace Orchestra in 1939, staying with the band as vocalist and trumpeter until 1943. By that time, Eckstine had begun to make a name for himself through the Hines band's juke-box hits, such as \"Stormy Monday Blues\", and his own \"Jelly, Jelly\".\nIn 1944, Eckstine formed his own big band, and it became the finishing school for adventurous young musicians who would shape the future of jazz including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Gene Ammons, Miles Davis, Art Blakey, Cecil Payne, Fats Navarro, Lucky Thompson, John Malachi, Sarah Vaughan, Pearl Bailey, and Lena Horne. Tadd Dameron, Gil Fuller and Jerry Valentine were among the band's arrangers. The Billy Eckstine Orchestra is considered to be the first bebop big-band, and had Top Ten chart entries that included \"A Cottage for Sale\" and \"Prisoner of Love\". Both were awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.Dizzy Gillespie, in reflecting on the band in his 1979 autobiography To Be or Not to Bop, gives this perspective: \"There was no band that sounded like Billy Eckstine's. Our attack was strong, and we were playing bebop, the modern style. No other band like this one existed in the world.\" In 1946 Eckstine starred as the hero in the musical film Rhythm in a Riff, which also starred Ann Baker and Lucky Millinder.Eckstine became a solo performer in 1947, with records featuring lush, sophisticated orchestrations. Even before folding his band, Eckstine had recorded solo to support it, scoring two million-sellers in 1945 with \"Cottage for Sale\" and a revival of \"Prisoner of Love\". Far more successful than his band recordings, these prefigured Eckstine's future career. Eckstine would go on to record over a dozen hits during the late 1940s. He signed with the newly established MGM Records, and had immediate hits with revivals of \"Everything I Have Is Yours\" (1947), Rodgers and Hart's \"Blue Moon\" (1948), and Juan Tizol's \"Caravan\" (1949).\nEckstine had further success in 1950 with Victor Young's theme song to \"My Foolish Heart,\" and the next year with a revival of the 1931 Bing Crosby hit, \"I Apologize\".His 1950 appearance at the Paramount Theatre in New York City, drew a larger audience than Frank Sinatra at his Paramount performance.Eckstine was the subject of a three-page profile in the April 24, 1950 issue of Life magazine, in which the photographer Martha Holmes accompanied Eckstine and his entourage during a week in New York City. One photograph taken by Holmes and published in Life showed Eckstine with a group of white female admirers, one of whom had her hand on his shoulder and her head on his chest while she was laughing. Eckstine's biographer, Cary Ginell, wrote of the image that Holmes \"...captured a moment of shared exuberance, joy, and affection, unblemished by racial tension\". Holmes would later describe the photograph as the favorite of the many she had taken in her career as it \"...told just what the world should be like\". The photograph was considered so controversial that an editor at Life sought personal approval from Henry Luce, the magazine's publisher, who said it should be published. The publication of the image caused letters of protest to be written to the magazine, and singer Harry Belafonte subsequently said of the publication that \"When that photo hit, in this national publication, it was if a barrier had been broken\". The controversy that resulted from the photograph had a seminal effect on the trajectory of Eckstine's career. Tony Bennett would recall that \"It changed everything...Before that, he had a tremendous following...and it just offended the white community\", a sentiment shared by pianist Billy Taylor who said that the \"coverage and that picture just slammed the door shut for him\".In 1951, Eckstine performed at the seventh Cavalcade of Jazz concert held on July 8 at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. Also featured were Lionel Hampton and his Revue, Percy Mayfield, Jimmy Witherspoon, Joe Liggins and The Honeydrippers and Roy Brown.Among Eckstine's recordings of the 1950s was a 1957 duet with Sarah Vaughan, \"Passing Strangers\", a minor hit for them in 1957, but an initial No. 22 success in the UK Singles Chart.The 1960 Las Vegas live album, No Cover, No Minimum, featured Eckstine taking a few trumpet solos and showcasing his nightclub act. He recorded albums for Mercury and Roulette in the early 1960s and appeared on Motown albums during the mid to late years of the decade. After recording sparingly during the 1970s for Al Bell's Stax/Enterprise imprint, the international touring Eckstine made his last recording, the Grammy-nominated Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter in 1986.\nEckstine made numerous appearances on television variety shows, including on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Nat King Cole Show, The Tonight Show with Steve Allen, Jack Paar, and Johnny Carson, The Merv Griffin Show, The Art Linkletter Show, The Joey Bishop Show, The Dean Martin Show, The Flip Wilson Show, and Playboy After Dark. He also performed as an actor in the TV sitcom Sanford and Son, and in such films as Skirts Ahoy, Let's Do It Again, and Jo Jo Dancer. He performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" prior to Game 4 of the 1979 World Series at Three Rivers Stadium in his native Pittsburgh.\nCulturally Eckstine was a fashion icon. He was famous for his \"Mr. B. Collar\" \u2013 a high roll collar that formed a \"B\" over a Windsor-knotted tie (or without a tie at all). The collars were worn by many a hipster in the late 1940s and early 1950s.\nIn 1984, Eckstine recorded his penultimate album, I Am a Singer, arranged and conducted by Angelo DiPippo and featuring Toots Thielemans on harmonica. In November 1986, Eckstine recorded with saxophonist Benny Carter for his 1987 album Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter.

When he made a recording of \"Caravan\", I was happy and honored to watch one of our tunes help take him into the stratosphere of universal acclaim. And, of course, he hasn't looked back since. A remarkable artist, the sonorous B. ... His style and technique have been extensively copied by some of the neocommercial singers, but despite their efforts, he remains out front to show how and what should have been done.\nSammy Davis, Jr. made several live appearances and impersonated Eckstine. Eckstine was a pallbearer at Davis' funeral in 1990.And, in Billboard, Quincy Jones stated:\n\nI looked up to Mr. B as an idol. I wanted to dress like him, talk like him, pattern my whole life as a musician and as a complete person in the image of dignity that he projected.... As a black man, Eckstine was not immune to the prejudice that characterized the 1950s.\nJones is quoted in The Pleasures of Jazz as also saying of Eckstine: \n\nIf he'd been white, the sky would have been the limit. As it was, he didn't have his own radio or TV show, much less a movie career. He had to fight the system, so things never quite fell into place.\"\nLionel Hampton said: \n\nHe was one of the greatest singers of all time.... We were proud of him because he was the first Black popular singer singing popular songs in our race. We, the whole music profession, were so happy to see him achieve what he was doing. He was one of the greatest singers of that era...

Katrin Horn, a postdoctoral fellow in American studies, described her vocal delivery as \"slightly raspy\" with \"a little vibrato\".

Black Radical moved to 2-Bone Records to release \"Monsoon\" (2-Bone, 1989) before signing with UK label Mango Records.

AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it was \"one of the great dance-pop albums\", that showcases Madonna's skills as a \"songwriter, record-maker, provocateur, and entertainer through its wide reach, accomplishment, and sheer sense of fun\". This opinion was echoed by the staff of Billboard, who were impressed with the \"confident\" album, and the singer's growth as writer and producer. Erika Wexler from Spin wrote: \"Madonna knows her days as the chanteuse for teenage romance are numbered. With perfect timing, [she] gently distanced herself from that role, and although some of the songs [on True Blue] have the sophistication of a training bra, there are glowing moments\". The New York Times' Stephen Holden noted that, despite lacking the \"gleaming ultra-sleek aural surfaces\" of Like a Virgin, True Blue's made up of \"shrewdly crafted teen-age and pre-teen-age ditties that reveal Madonna's unfailing commercial instincts\", and find her singing with \"a lot more heart\". This opinion was shared by Rolling Stone, where Davitt Sigerson referred to True Blue as a \"sturdy, dependable, lovable\" album, and singled out the singer's voice for sounding \"better than ever\".Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times, pointed out that the \"most obvious growth\" was Madonna's voice, which is \"so finely tailored that she actually extends the punch and appeal of the production touches\". He went on to say: \"True Blue isn't revolutionary music, but it is imaginative, highly energized pop that recognizes the limitations and pleasures of Top 40 fare\". PopMatters' Peter Piatkowski also applauded the singer's more mature vocals, and deemed the record \"brilliant, one that speaks to its time but also celebrates the disparate cultures that influence [Madonna's] sound at the moment\". True Blue is the \"most polished\" of Madonna's first three albums, according to El Hunt from the Evening Standard. In the same vein, Mary Von Aue from Stereogum said it has \"more vocal range and lyrical complexities\" than Like a Virgin and Madonna. True Blue was hailed \"nine tracks of 80s pop perfection [...] Madonna\u2019s strongest effort from that decade\" by the staff of Gay Times. For Joseph Earp from Australian website Junkee, \"with its era-defining production, and sweaty sheen of subversion, [True Blue is] the singer's way of understanding everything that came afterwards [...] most pop singers never release a record this good in their whole career\".Lucy O'Brien pointed out that, whereas her debut and Like a Virgin were a \"sound in development\", True Blue sees Madonna \"nail[ing] her signature style - rhythmic, dramatic, danceable, and distinctively melodic\". Replacing Nile Rodgers with Leonard and Bray resulted in a \"less polished, but more varied\" album, according to The Sunday Telegraph's Larry Nager. The review ended on a somewhat critical note: True Blue is \"classic pop [...] an entertaining album's worth of catchy, danceable tunes\", despite \"not much content beneath the candy-coating\", concluded Nager. Despite naming it a \"supreme archetype of '80s pop music\", with its tracks being \"undeniably more mature\" than her previous endeavors, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani felt True Blue was home to \"some of [Madonna's] biggest clunkers\", and is \"undeniably of its time\". To Karen Cooke from Australian newspaper The Age, even though it includes a couple of \"tedious\" tracks, \"this record is full of songs to make you tap the steering wheel [and] dance in the loungeroom\". True Blue's main flaw is that its five singles are \"so strong they overshadow\" the rest of the tracks, which seem \"slight by comparison\", wrote Daryl Easlea.In less favorable reviews, John Quayle from the Observer\u2013Reporter dismissed the record as \"warmed over Go-Gos material\", but applauded the singles for being \"strong enough to convince even her worst critics that Madonna does have talent - and lots of it\". Mary Von Aue noted that the album experiments with \"different sounds that are well executed as singles\", but as a whole sounds \"disjointed\", concluding that, \"[True Blue] doesn\u2019t live up to the strength of [its singles]\". For Don McLeese from the Chicago Sun-Times, although it represents a \"valiant -and necessary- attempt on Madonna's part to expand her artistic range, True Blue just isn't as much fun\" as her previous records. The Record-Journal's Jim Zebora was also negative: \"[True Blue] contains one absolutely marvelous torch song called 'Live To Tell' [...] Unfortunately, the rest is barely competent post-disco [...] So let's call it a C plus and program the CD player to ignore eight out of [its] nine songs\". Finally, Larry Kilman, writing for American newspaper The Evening News, compared it negatively to the work of girl groups such as the Ronettes and the Shangri-Las, dismissing it as \"mindless, inspid [and] air-headed\", adding that, \"[its] slick production and arrangements disguise much of the tininess of [Madonna's] voice [...] But that's as good as [True Blue] gets\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53212", "text": "Notes\n\n^b  signifies additional lyrics", "hasanswer": false}]}

His three-finger style of playing was radically different from the traditional way the five-string banjo had previously been played. This new style of playing became popular and elevated the banjo from its previous role as a background rhythm instrument to featured solo status. He popularized the instrument across several genres of music.\nScruggs' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in Bill Monroe's band, the Blue Grass Boys. \"Bluegrass\" eventually became the name for an entire genre of country music. Despite considerable success with Monroe, performing on the Grand Ole Opry and recording classic hits such as \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", Scruggs resigned from the group in 1946 because of their exhausting touring schedule. Fellow band member Lester Flatt resigned as well, and he and Scruggs later paired up in the duo Flatt and Scruggs. Scruggs' banjo instrumental \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" was released in 1949 and became an enduring hit. The song experienced a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. The song won two Grammy Awards and, in 2005, was selected for the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit.\nFlatt and Scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\", the theme music for the television sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies\u2014the first Scruggs recording to reach number one on the Billboard charts. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 singles. The duo broke up in 1969, chiefly because, while Scruggs wanted to switch styles to fit a more modern sound, Flatt was a traditionalist who opposed the change and believed doing so would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists. Although each of them formed a new band to match their visions, neither of them ever regained the success they had achieved as a team.\nScruggs received four Grammy awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a National Medal of Arts. He became a member of the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1985, Flatt and Scruggs were inducted together into the Country Music Hall of Fame and named, as a duo, number 24 on CMT's \"40 Greatest Men of Country Music\". Scruggs was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the United States. Four works by Scruggs have been placed in the Grammy Hall of Fame. After Scruggs' death in 2012 at age 88, the Earl Scruggs Center was founded in Shelby, North Carolina, near his birthplace with the aid of a federal grant and corporate donors. The center is a $5.5 million facility that features the musical contributions of Scruggs and serves as an educational center providing classes and field trips for students.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_40976", "text": "Earl Scruggs was born January 6, 1924, in the Flint Hill community of Cleveland County, North Carolina, a small community just outside of Boiling Springs, about 10 miles west of Shelby. His father, George Elam Scruggs, was a farmer and a bookkeeper who died of a protracted illness when Earl was four years old. Upon his father's death, Scruggs' mother, Georgia Lula Ruppe (called Lula), was left to take care of the farm and five children, of which Earl was the youngest.The family members all played music. The father played an open back banjo using the frailing technique, though as an adult Earl had no recollection of his father's playing. Mrs. Scruggs played the pump organ. Earl's siblings, older brothers Junie and Horace and older sisters Eula Mae and Ruby, all played banjo and guitar. Scruggs recalled a visit to his uncle's home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named Mack Woolbright, who played a finger-picking style and had recorded for Columbia Records. It made an impression on Scruggs, who said, \"He'd sit in the rocking chair, and he'd pick some and it was just amazing. I couldn't imagine\u2014he was the first, what I call a good banjo player.\" Scruggs then took up the instrument\u2014he was too small to hold it at first and improvised by setting his brother Junie's banjo beside him on the floor. He moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing. After his father's death, Scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music, and when not in school or doing farm chores, spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing. His first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40979", "text": "In 1948 Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs formed the duo Flatt and Scruggs and chose the name \"the Foggy Mountain Boys\" for their backing band. The name came from a song by the Carter Family called \"Foggy Mountain Top\" that the band used as a theme song at the time. Flatt later acknowledged that they consciously tried to make their sound different from Monroe's group. In the mid 1950s they dropped the mandolin and added a Dobro, played by Buck \"Uncle Josh\" Graves. In the spring of 1949, their second Mercury recording session yielded the classic \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\", released on 78 RPM phonograph records that were in use at the time. Previously, Scruggs had performed something similar, called \"Bluegrass Breakdown\" with Bill Monroe, but Monroe had denied him songwriting credit for it. Later, Scruggs changed the song, adding a minor chord, thus creating \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" The song contains a musical oddity\u2014Flatt plays an E major chord against Scruggs's E minor. When asked about the dissonance years later, Scruggs said he had tried to get Flatt to consistently play a minor there to no avail; he said he eventually became used to the sound and even fond of it. The song won a Grammy and became an anthem for many banjo players to attempt to master. The band routinely tuned its instruments a half-step higher than standard tuning in those days to get more brightness or pop to the sound, returning to standard pitch in the 1960s.\nThe popularity of Foggy Mountain Breakdown resurged years later when it was featured in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde, which introduced the song to a younger generation of fans. Scruggs received a phone call from the show's producer and star, Warren Beatty, first asking Scruggs to write a song for the movie. Soon Beatty called back saying that he wanted to use the existing vintage Mercury recording of Foggy Mountain Breakdown, and rejected the argument that it was recorded 18 years prior at a radio station with no modern enhancements. The film was a hit, called by the Los Angeles Times \"a landmark film that helped usher in a new era in American filmmaking.\" In 2005, the song was selected for the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit.In October 1951, the band recorded \"Earl's Breakdown\" which featured a technique where Scruggs would manually de-tune the second and third strings of the banjo during a song using a cam device he had made to attach to the instrument, giving the surprise effect of a downward string bend. He and his brother Horace had experimented with it when they were growing up. Scruggs had drilled some holes in the peghead of his banjo to install the device and chipped the pearl inlay. He covered the holes with a piece of metal, which can be seen on the album cover of Foggy Mountain Jamboree. The technique became popular and led to improvement of the design (without drilling holes) by Bill Keith who then manufactured Scruggs-Keith Tuners. The original tuners Scruggs made and used are now in a museum display at the Earl Scruggs Center in Shelby, North Carolina.In 1953, Martha White Foods sponsored the band's regular early morning radio shows on WSM in Nashville, where the duo sang the company's catchy bluegrass jingle written by Pat Twitty. About this time, country music television shows, on which Flatt and Scruggs appeared regularly, went into syndication, vastly increasing the group's exposure. Despite the group's increasing popularity and fan mail, WSM did not allow Flatt and Scruggs to become members of the Grand Ole Opry at first. According to Tennessean writer Peter Cooper, Bill Monroe was in opposition and worked behind the scenes to keep Flatt and Scruggs off the Opry to the extent of having petitions made against their membership. In 1955 Martha White Foods' CEO Cohen E. Williams intervened by threatening to pull all of his advertising from WSM unless the band appeared on the Opry in the segment sponsored by his company. As years went by, the band became synonymous with Martha White to the extent that the advertising jingle became a hit, and the band rarely played a concert without it. Fans shouted requests for them to play it, even at Carnegie Hall.On September 24, 1962, the duo recorded \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\" for the TV show The Beverly Hillbillies. Sung by Jerry Scoggins, the theme song became an immediate country music hit and was played at the beginning and end of each episode of the series. The song went to #1 on the Billboard country chart, a first for any bluegrass recording. The song spent 20 weeks on that chart; it also reached #44 on Billboard's pop chart. The television show was also a huge hit, broadcast in 76 countries around the world. In Queens, New York a five-year-old boy named B\u00e9la Fleck heard the Jed Clampett theme on television. Fleck said, \"I couldn't breathe or think; I was completely mesmerized.\" He said it awakened a deeply embedded predisposition that \"was just in there\" to learn how to play the banjo. Flatt and Scruggs appeared in several episodes as family friends of the fictional Clampetts. In their first appearance (season 1, episode 20), they portray themselves in the show and perform both the theme song and \"Pearl, Pearl, Pearl\". That song went to #8 on the country chart in 1963. Scruggs published an instruction book entitled \"Earl Scruggs and the Five String Banjo\" in 1968. It received a Gold Book Award by the publisher, Peer-Southern Corporation when it sold over a million copies. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 single records and featured over 20 different musicians as \"Foggy Mountain Boys\"\u2014side men backing the duo.By the end of the 1960s, Scruggs was getting bored with repetition of the classic bluegrass fare. By now, his sons were professional musicians, and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music. He said, \"I love bluegrass music, and still like to play it, but I do like to mix in some other music for my own personal satisfaction, because if I don't, I can get a little bogged down and a little depressed\". Scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts. Columbia Records executives told Flatt and Scruggs that they intended to try a new producer, Bob Johnston, instead of their long-time producer Don Law. Johnston had produced Bob Dylan's records. This new association produced Changin' Times, Nashville Airplane, and The Story of Bonnie and Clyde albums. Flatt was not happy with some of this material\u2014he didn't like singing Bob Dylan songs and refused to perform them, saying \"I can't sing Bob Dylan stuff, I mean. Columbia has got Bob Dylan, why did they want me?\". Even the success of the Bonnie and Clyde album was not enough to prevent their breakup in 1969. After the split, Flatt formed a traditional bluegrass group with Curly Seckler and Marty Stuart called The Nashville Grass, and Scruggs formed the Earl Scruggs Revue with his sons.Neither Flatt nor Scruggs spoke to each other for the next ten years\u2014until 1979 when Flatt was in the hospital. Scruggs made an unannounced visit to his bedside. The two men talked for more than an hour. Even though Flatt's voice was barely above a whisper, he spoke of a reunion. Scruggs answered yes, but told Flatt they would talk when he was better. Flatt said, \"It came as quite a surprise and made me feel good.\" However, Lester Flatt never recovered, and died May 11, 1979. Historian Barry Willis, speaking of the meeting, said \"Earl gave Lester his flowers while he was still living.\" (He was referring to a 1957 Flatt and Scruggs recording of \"Give Me My Flowers While I'm Still Living\".)", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40977", "text": "Scruggs is noted for popularizing a three-finger banjo-picking style now called \"Scruggs style\" that has become a defining characteristic of bluegrass music. Prior to Scruggs, most banjo players used the frailing or clawhammer technique, which consists of holding the fingers bent like a claw and moving the entire hand in a downward motion so that the strings are struck with the back of the middle fingernail. This motion is followed by striking the thumb on a single string. The three-finger style of playing is radically different from frailing; the hand remains stationary and only the fingers and thumb move, somewhat similar to classical guitar technique. Scruggs style also involves using picks on three digits (see photo), each plucking individual strings\u2014downward with the thumb, then upward with the index and middle finger in sequence. When done skillfully and in rapid sequence, the style allows any digit (though usually the thumb) to play a melody, while the other two digits play arpeggios of the melody line. The use of picks gives each note a louder percussive attack, creating an exciting effect, described by The New York Times as \"like thumbtacks plinking rhythmically on a tin roof\". This departure from traditional playing elevated the banjo to become more of a solo instrument\u2014a promotion from its former role of providing background rhythm or serving as a comedian's prop\u2014and popularized the instrument in several genres of music.Earl Scruggs did not invent three-finger banjo playing; in fact, he said the three-finger style was the most common way to play the five-string banjo in his hometown in western North Carolina. An early influence was a local banjoist, DeWitt \"Snuffy\" Jenkins, who plucked in a finger style. According to banjoist and historian Tony Trischka, \"Jenkins came about as close as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing it\". At age ten, when Scruggs first learned the technique, he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother. He was idly playing a song called \"Reuben\" and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers, not two. \"That excited me to no end\", he later recalled, and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling \"I've got it\". From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it. Controversy exists as to the actual origin of three-finger picking style. Don Reno, an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age, described Scruggs' early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkins. Scruggs, however, consistently referred to it as his own, saying that he adapted to it \"a syncopated roll that was quite different.\" On the subject, John Hartford said, \"Here's the way I feel about it. Everybody's all worried about who invented the style and it's obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long time\u2014maybe since 1840.

Scruggs was one of the few bluegrass or country artists to give support to the anti-war movement. The Earl Scruggs Revue gained popularity on college campuses, live shows and festivals and appeared on the bill with acts like Steppenwolf, The Byrds and James Taylor. They recorded for Columbia Records and made frequent network television appearances though the 1970s. Their album I Saw the Light with a Little Help from my Friends featured Linda Ronstadt, Arlo Guthrie, Tracy Nelson, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. This collaboration sparked enthusiasm by the latter to make the album Will the Circle be Unbroken. Earl and Louise Scruggs made phone calls to eminent country stars like Roy Acuff and \"Mother\" Maybelle Carter to get them to participate in this project to bring a unique combination of older players with young ones. Bill Monroe refused to participate saying he had to remain true to the style he pioneered, and this \"is not bluegrass\" The album became a classic, and was selected for the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit.Scruggs had to retire from the road in 1980 because of back problems, but the Earl Scruggs Revue did not part ways until 1982. Despite the group's commercial success, they were never embraced by bluegrass or country music purists. Scruggs remained active musically and released The Storyteller and the Banjoman with Tom T. Hall in 1982, and a compilation album Top of the World in 1983. In 1994, Scruggs teamed up with Randy Scruggs and Doc Watson to contribute the song \"Keep on the Sunny Side\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country. In 2001, Scruggs broke a 17-year personal album hiatus with the album Earl Scruggs and Friends, featuring Elton John, Sting, Don Henley, Johnny Cash, Dwight Yoakam, Billy Bob Thornton, and Steve Martin. It includes the song \"Passin' Thru\", written by Johnny Cash and Randy Scruggs.

Brouwer contributed to the development of the genre of tronies, i.e. head or facial studies, which investigate varieties of expression.

The early Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken included multiple erroneous statements and fanciful stories about Brouwer in his The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters of 1718\u201319.  The most glaring mistakes of Houbraken were to place Brouwer's place of birth in Haarlem in the Dutch Republic and to identify Frans Hals as his master.\nIt is now generally accepted that Brouwer was born in Oudenaarde in Flanders in 1605 or 1606.  His father who was also called Adriaen worked as a tapestry designer in Oudenaarde, at the time an important centre for tapestry production in Flanders.  The father died in poverty when Adriaen the younger was only 15 or 16 years old.  Brouwer had by that time already left the paternal home.Brouwer worked in Antwerp in 1622. By March 1625 Adriaen Brouwer was recorded in Amsterdam where he resided in the inn of the painter Barend van Someren, another Flemish artist who had taken up residence in the Dutch Republic. Brouwer is further recorded on 23 July 1626 as a notary's witness when he signed a statement of Barend van Someren and Adriaen van Nieulandt about a sale of pictures in Amsterdam.  It is possible that by that time he already lived in Haarlem. He was active in the Chamber of Rhetoric 'De Wijngaertranken' in Haarlem. The motto of this amateur literary circle was: \"In Love Above All Else\".\nIn 1631 Brouwer returned to his native Flanders where he was registered as a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke even before he had become a poorter of Antwerp. The artist continued to live and work in Antwerp until his untimely death. The artist's name regularly shows up in Antwerp records usually in connection with arrangements for his various debts.\nIn 1633 Brouwer was jailed in the Antwerp Citadel. The reason for the imprisonment is not clear. Possibly it was for tax evasion, or, alternatively, for political reasons because the local authorities may have considered him to be a spy for the Dutch Republic. The operation of the bakery in the Antwerp Citadel was in the hands of the baker Joos van Craesbeeck. It is assumed that Brouwer and van Craesbeeck got to know each other during this time.  Based on information provided by contemporary Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie in his book Het Gulden Cabinet van Craesbeeck is believed to have become Brouwer's pupil and best friend. Their relationship was described by de Bie as \"Soo d'oude songhen, soo pypen de jonghen\" (\"As the old ones sang, so the young ones chirp\"). The stylistic similarities of van Craesbeeck's early work with that of Brouwer seem to corroborate such pupilage.On 26 April 1634 Adriaen Brouwer took up lodgings in the house of the prominent engraver Paulus Pontius as the two men had become close friends.  The same year the pair joined the local chamber of rhetoric Violieren. It has been suggested that Brouwer's painting called Fat Man or Luxuria (Mauritshuis), which possibly represents the deadly sin of lust, is at the same time a portrait of Paulus Pontius.\nEarly biographers describe how Adriaen Brouwer and his artist friends spent much of their time in local taverns. Brouwer painted a tavern scene called The Smokers, which included a self-portrait together with portraits of Jan Cossiers, Jan Lievens, Joos van Craesbeeck and Jan Davidsz. de Heem (c. 1636, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).  The company of friends is shown sitting around a table and smoking. Brouwer is the figure in the middle who is turned around to face the viewer.  This type of group portrait doubled as a representation of one of the five senses (in this case the sense of taste).Despite his reported dissolute lifestyle and his preference for low-life subjects, Brouwer was highly respected by his colleagues as evidenced by the fact that Rubens owned 17 works by Brouwer at the time of his death, of which at least one had been acquired before Rubens got to know Brouwer personally. Rembrandt and Titus van Rijn also had paintings by Brouwer in his collection.\nIn 1635 Brouwer took on Jan-Baptist Dandoy (active 1631\u20131638) as his only officially registered pupil. In January 1638 Adriaen Brouwer died in Antwerp. Some early biographers associated his early death with his party lifestyle and abuse of alcohol. Houbraken, however, attributes his death to the plague. Evidence for the latter is that originally his remains were buried in a common grave. A month after his death on 1 February 1638, his body was re-interred in the Carmelite Church of Antwerp after a solemn ceremony and at the initiative and expense and in the presence of his artist friends.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Applied to the particulars of music, this means that \"harmony, melody, speed, rhythm, time and phrases all have equal position in the results that come from the placing and spacing of ideas\". (see: aspects of music)\nHarmolodics seeks to free musical compositions from any tonal center, allowing harmonic progression independent of traditional European notions of tension and release (see: atonality). Harmolodics may loosely be defined as an expression of music in which harmony, movement of sound, and melody all share the same value. The general effect is that music achieves an immediately open expression, without being constrained by tonal limitations, rhythmic pre-determination, or harmonic rules.\nRonald Radano suggests that Coleman's concepts of harmonic unison and harmolodics were influenced by Pierre Boulez's theory of aleatory while Gunther Schuller suggested that harmolodics is based on the superimposition of the same or similar phrases, thus creating polytonality and heterophony.Coleman had been preparing a book called The Harmolodic Theory since at least the 1970s, but this remains unpublished. The only other known explanation of harmolodics that was written by Coleman is an article called \"Prime Time for Harmolodics\" (1983).\nProponents include James Blood Ulmer and Jamaaladeen Tacuma. Ulmer, who played and toured with Coleman during the 1970s, has adopted harmolodics and applied the theories to his approach to jazz and blues guitar (for example, Harmolodic Guitar with Strings).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Noer, produced by G. Dwipayana, and starring Amoroso Katamsi, Umar Kayam, and Syubah Asa. Produced over a period of two years with a budget of Rp. 800 million, the film was sponsored by Suharto's New Order government. It was based on an official history of the 30 September Movement (Gerakan 30 September, or G30S) coup in 1965 written by Nugroho Notosusanto and Ismail Saleh, which depicted the coup as being orchestrated by the Communist Party of Indonesia (Partai Komunis Indonesia, or PKI).\nThe film depicts the period leading up to the coup and several days after it. In a time of economic turmoil, six generals are kidnapped and killed by the PKI and Air Force, purportedly to pre-empt a coup against President Sukarno. General Suharto destroys the coup and, afterwards urges the Indonesian populace to commemorate those killed and fight against all forms of communism. The film shows the G30S leadership as ruthless and planning \"every move to the last detail\", taking joy in using excessive violence and torturing the generals, depictions which have been read as portraying \"the state's enemies as outside the realm of the human\".The first commercially released domestic feature film to deal with the events of 1965, Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI was a commercial and critical success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival, winning one, and reached record viewership numbers \u2013 although in many cases audiences were required to see the film. The film was used as a propaganda vehicle by the New Order government until its collapse; televised annually on 30 September and became mandatory viewing for students.

Broadus has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States, and 35 million albums worldwide. His accolades include an American Music Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and 17 Grammy Award nominations.\nProduced entirely by Dr. Dre, Broadus' debut studio album, Doggystyle (1993) was released by Death Row Records and debuted atop the Billboard 200. Selling 800,000 copies in its first week, the album received quadruple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) the following year and spawned the Billboard Hot 100-top ten singles \"What's My Name?\" and \"Gin and Juice\". He was the lead performer on Death Row's soundtrack album for the 1994 short film Murder Was the Case, wherein Broadus made his acting debut. His second album, Tha Doggfather (1996) likewise debuted atop the chart and received double platinum certification. In 1998, he parted ways with Death Row in favor of Master P's No Limit Records, through which he saw largely continued success with his albums Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and Tha Last Meal (2000). He then signed with Priority, Capitol, and EMI Records to release his sixth album Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss (2002), which was further commercially-oriented. This effectively continued upon him signing with Geffen Records to release his next three albums: R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece (2004), Tha Blue Carpet Treatment (2006), and Ego Trippin' (2008); the former spawned the single \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" (featuring Pharrell), which became his first to peak atop the Billboard Hot 100. He then returned to Priority and Capitol\u2014upon his hiring as chairman of the former label\u2014to release his tenth and eleventh albums, Malice 'n Wonderland (2009) and Doggumentary (2011), both of which saw mild critical and commercial response.During this time, Broadus starred in films and hosted several television shows, including Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, Snoop Dogg's Father Hood, and Dogg After Dark. In 2012, following a trip to Jamaica, Snoop converted to Rastafari and adopted the alias Snoop Lion, under which he released a reggae album, Reincarnated (2013) and a namesake documentary film about his Jamaican experience. His thirteenth studio album, Bush (2015) was produced entirely by frequent collaborator Pharrell, while his fourteenth studio album, Coolaid (2016) was released the same year as his induction into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame. In 2018, Broadus became \"a born-again Christian\" and released his first gospel album, Bible of Love in March of that year. In November of that year, Broadus was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Also, in its storyline, players can't move the protagonist the same way they can in any other title of the series. In this title, the main character's name is used as the cursor on the map screen for selecting which place to enter. When the players are inside a place, a pop-up window will give the players choices on what to do inside the place the players are in.\nThe main object of the whole game is to finish its plot by collecting every Custom Robo, battle part, and other stuff that the player wants, while winning every battle that moves the players from one part of the storyline to the next. In Custom Robo battles, the object is to reduce the hit points of the players' opponent from 1000 to 0 by using different Custom Robos, guns, bombs, pods, and Action-Chips. The exclusive Action-Chip within this version allows the players to create an additional shield of defense or to expand on the players' various maneuvers. In this game, many combinations are present when it comes to the players' specific weapon. This combinational process however is strengthened even greater with the new Action-Chip ability. Battles begin with the players' robo being launched out of a Robocannon which is controlled with the D-pad.\nUnlike other Custom Robo titles, once shot out of the Robocannon, players have a random amount of time for their Custom Robo to be ready to battle, instead of depending on which six sides of the cube they land on. Custom Robos are arranged in groups that are similar to their abilities. In camera views, unlike other Custom Robo titles, this one has only one, which zooms out whenever two Custom Robos are far from each other, while it zooms in whenever they are close to each other. The endurance bar is located above the players' hit points. Once it runs out, the players' robo gets \"downed\" which means that it stays fallen for a couple seconds. After it gets up, it goes into \"rebirth\", where it stays invincible for about 3 seconds.

Reznor's lyrics express adolescent angst and feelings of betrayal by lovers, society, or God. Themes of despair are collocated with lovesick sentiments. Pitchfork's Tom Breihan categorized it as a synth-pop album that was shaped by industrial music's \"nascent new-wave period rather than its subsequent styles.\" According to Breihan, the beats were muscular, but not in the vein of metal or post-punk, and that the most rock-inspired song on the album was \"Head Like a Hole\".Journalist Jon Pareles described the album as \"electro-rock or industrial rock, using drum machines, computerized synthesizer riffs and obviously processed sounds to detail, and usually denounce, an artificial world.\" Tom Popson of the Chicago Tribune called it a dance album partly characterized by industrial dance's aggressive sound: \"Reznor's electronics-plus-guitar LP also carries a brighter techno-pop element that might remind some of Depeche Mode. Things occasionally mellow out to moody atmospherics, while Reznor's vocals range from whispers to screams.\" PopMatters' AJ Ramirez regarded the album as \"a synthesizer-dominated industrial dance record that on occasion slipped under the alternative rock banner.\"Reznor has humorously described Pretty Hate Machine as \"the all-purpose alternative album,\" remarking that \"if you want to stage dive to it, you can, but if you're a big Depeche Mode fan, you can get what you need out of it as well.\" Reznor further stated: \"I like electronic music, but I like it to have some aggression. That 'first wave' of electro music \u2013 Human League and Devo \u2013 that's the easiest way to use it. To be able to get some humanity and aggression into it in a cool way, that's the thing ... Pretty Hate Machine is a record you can listen to and get more out of each time.

Robert Hilburn found Reznor's \"dark obsession\" compelling in the Los Angeles Times, while Q's Martin Aston said Reznor \"scans the spectrum of modern dance\" with a \"panoramic vision\" that is \"both admirably adventurous and yet accessible.\" Select critic Neil Perry said that record was \"a flawed but listenable labour of loathing\". Ralph Traitor of Sounds said that \"Reznor has guts, and they make his Machine one to be treated with respect\", finding that the album was comparable to releases by Ministry and Foetus.Jon Pareles was less impressed in his review for The New York Times, writing that Pretty Hate Machine \"stays so close to the conventions established by Depeche Mode, Soft Cell and New Order that it could be a parody album\". Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post found the music \"competent but undistinctive stuff\" and believed the \"angry denunciations\" of songs such as \"Terrible Lie\" are overshadowed by the \"nursery-rhyme\" chants of \"Down in It\". Tom Popson wrote in the Chicago Tribune that \"the playing and production get points for introducing some variety to the industrial style, but the moments of soap-on-a-rope singing tend to cancel them out.\"In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Steve Huey commended Reznor for giving \"industrial music a human voice, a point of connection\" with his \"tortured confusion and self-obsession\", and felt that \"the greatest achievement of Pretty Hate Machine was that it brought emotional extravagance to a genre whose main theme had nearly always been dehumanization.\" Upon its 2010 reissue, Will Hermes of Rolling Stone called it \"the first industrial singer-songwriter album\" and commended the sound produced by Flood and Keith LeBlanc, who he said \"taught Reznor a lot.\" Kyle Ryan of The A.V.

Reznor received contract offers from many of the labels, but eventually signed with TVT Records, who were known mainly for releasing novelty and television jingle records. Pretty Hate Machine was recorded in various studios with Reznor collaborating with some of his most idolized producers: Flood, Keith LeBlanc, Adrian Sherwood, and John Fryer. Much like his recorded demo, Reznor refused to record the album with a conventional band, recording Pretty Hate Machine mostly by himself.\n\"A lot of it sounds immature to me now,\" he stated in 1991 of the recordings that were then two years old. \"At first it totally sucked. I became completely withdrawn. I couldn't function in society very well. And the LP became a product of that. It's quite small scale, introverted, claustrophobic \u2013 that's the feel I went for.\"Reznor discussed the recording and touring of Pretty Hate Machine in the April 1990 issue of Keyboard. He used an E-mu Emax because it produced a high-end buzzing noise when transposing down sounds. Rough and first takes of vocals and guitar were used to contrast the quantized drums and bass. Reznor hated the factory sounds of the Emax but had not transferred anything from his old Emulator, and used samples from his record collection for all the drum sounds. He initially expected to use real drum sounds when recording the album, but in the end he and the producers merely equalized his drum samples.After the album was released, a recording known as Purest Feeling surfaced. The bootleg album contains early demo recordings of many of the tracks featured on Pretty Hate Machine, as well as a couple that were not used (\"Purest Feeling\", \"Maybe Just Once\", and an instrumental introduction to \"Sanctified\" called \"Slate\").

Although he is somewhat obscure today, Piccinni was one of the most popular composers of opera\u2014particularly the Neapolitan opera buffa\u2014of the Classical period.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_41547", "text": "Piccinni was born in Bari, in the Apulia region. From the age of fourteen, he was educated at the Conservatory of San Onofrio by Leonardo Leo and Francesco Durante, thanks to the intervention of the Bishop of Bari (his father, although himself a musician, was opposed to his son following the same career).\nPiccinni's first opera, Le donne dispettose, was produced in 1755 with the patronage of Prince Vintimille. In 1760 he composed, at Rome, the chef d'\u0153uvre of his early life, La Cecchina, ossia la buona Figliuola, an opera buffa with a libretto by Carlo Goldoni, which \"enjoyed a two-year run in Rome and was played in all the important European capitals. It can probably be called the most popular opera buffa of the 18th century...[even more than]... Pergolesi's La serva padrona...[and]... The first of the new era, culminating in the masterworks of Mozart.\"La buona figliuola represents a special moment in the history of eighteenth-century music in which comedy began to take on a new dramatic force. It is the moment at which the self-consciously sentimental theatrical project of Carlo Goldoni (the opera's librettist) is married with the developing musical language of classicism. This can especially be seen in the sensitive writing of Cecchina's act 2 aria \"Una povera ragazza\".The opera was such a success that fashions of dress, shops, and houses were all named after La Cecchina. It also set off a debate about the merits of the new sentimental style, especially in England, where conservative reactionaries were wary of the supposed feminizing influence of modern Italian music. Antonio Baretti commented in 1768 that individuals \u201cof weight and consideration\u201d should not be blamed for condemning \u201cthose puny gentlemen\u201d who, as enthusiasts of Italian opera, were able to \u201cfeel its minuet niceties, and to be of course in rapture with the languishing Cecchina\u2019s of Piccini  [sic].\u201d This modern music, Baretti decried, \u201cfar from having any power of increasing courage or any manly virtues, has on the contrary a tendency towards effeminacy and cowardliness.\u201dSix years after this, Piccinni was invited by Queen Marie Antoinette to Paris. He became the first Italian after Jean-Baptiste Lully to write operas for the Academie royale de musique (the Paris Opera). He collaborated with the poet and dramatist Marmontel on several projects designed to advance the cause of the operatic reform. Marmontel's first librettos took as their foundation texts Philippe Quinault had written for Lully, Roland 1778, and Atys, 1779. Subsequent works, starting with Didon, used original texts. All his later works were successful, but the directors of the Grand Opera conceived the idea of deliberately opposing him to Gluck by persuading the two composers to treat the same subject \u2013 Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride \u2013 simultaneously. The Parisian public was divided into two rival parties, which, under the names of Gluckists and Piccinnists, carried on an unworthy and disgraceful war. Gluck's masterly Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride was first produced on 18 May 1779. Piccinni's Iphig\u00e9nie followed on 23 January 1781. The antagonism of the rival parties continued, even after Gluck left Paris in 1780; and an attempt was afterwards made to inaugurate a new rivalry with Sacchini. Piccinni remained popular, and on the death of Gluck, in 1787, proposed that a public monument be erected to his memory \u2013 a suggestion which the Gluckists refused to support.\nIn 1784 Piccinni became professor at the Royal School of Music, one of the institutions from which the Conservatoire was formed in 1794. On the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Piccinni returned to Naples, where he was at first well received by King Ferdinand IV; but the marriage of his daughter Claire to a French democrat named Pierre Prades-Prestreau brought him disgrace \u2013 he was accused of being a revolutionary and placed under house arrest for four years. For the next nine years he maintained a precarious existence in Venice, Naples and Rome; but he returned in 1798 to Paris, where the public received him with enthusiasm, but he made no money. He died in Passy, near Paris. During his life, he worked with the greatest librettists of his age, including Metastasio. After his death a memorial tablet was set up in the house in which he was born at Bari.\nHe had married in 1756 his pupil Vincenza Sibilla, a singer, whom he never allowed to appear on the stage after their marriage.

The project did not evolve into a band until 1992 when Masatomo Kawase joined the project under the alias JAKE as guitarist and main composer, and the band changed its name to Guniw Tools. The band's third member, Asaki Yamahana, was initially only involved as a live support member but eventually became a full-fledged band member after gaining popularity with the fans. Having amassed a significant following by 1996, Guniw Tools was signed to Victor Entertainment, a major record company, and quickly released their first album Niwlun on Victor's Invitation label.\nA home video was released to accompany Niwlun, featuring music videos for each song on the album primarily directed by Furukawa and shot and produced by the band themselves. These \"DIY\" videos would become a signature of the band, and almost all releases by the band (albums and singles alike) had a corresponding VHS release with videos for each song.\n1997 saw the release of their second album Other Goose, followed by the mini-album Sparky. Though these albums proved to be successful (and would in fact be the highest-charting albums of the band's career), JAKE was not satisfied with the direction the band and chose to leave the project, leaving the band without their main composer.\nWith JAKE gone, the band continued as a duo and Asaki took over the duties as the band's main composer which led to a noticeable shift in style. This new style emerged on the band's first single following JAKE's departure, DADA. While the sound of the JAKE years had been influenced by folk rock, jazz, and shoegaze, this new single displayed hard electronic and industrial influences. This electro-industrial style was further expanded upon on the band's 1998 LP, Dazzle, and their 1999 LP, Fickle Boon.\nIn recent years, these two albums have come under scrutiny after reaching a Western audience thanks to the internet. It has been found that multiple songs seem to take elements from songs by the likes of Curve, The Stone Roses, Duran Duran, PJ Harvey, and Yo La Tengo, though the liner notes list only Asaki as songwriter. These allegations have never been addressed by the band.\nIn 2000 the band released the single CULLUCOO VISION before announcing a hiatus while the two band members explored new musical venues. Asaki went on to form the group Age of Punk and later joined with the group Bug. Full formed the group Nookicky and, after that group also went on hiatus, began releasing material under the name Shilfee and Tulipcorobockles.\nThe band has never officially come off hiatus, though there has been some activity since 2000.

Some music outlets have also compared Legrand's vocals to 1980s psychedelic rock vocalist Kendra Smith of the band Opal. Guitarist Alex Scally plays a Fender Stratocaster guitar in an E\u266d Tuning. The group's influences include This Mortal Coil, Cocteau Twins, The Zombies, Brian Wilson, Fran\u00e7oise Hardy, Neil Young, Big Star, Tony, Caro and John and Chris Bell.Beach House re-recorded the Tony, Caro and John song \"Snowdon Song\" and renamed it \"Lovelier Girl\". The song was released on the band's self-titled album with no attribution. Initially, Tony Dore of Tony, Caro and John stated, \"I haven't seen much yet in terms of royalties or acknowledgement of authorship\". Several months later, however, Dore disclosed that discussions had taken place to apply proper attribution on re-releases of the self-titled album.Legrand has described creating new music and releasing albums as a necessity for the band, saying, \"When we decide that a record is finished, I think it's really about coming to terms with saying 'OK, I think we've done everything that we could do, and now it's time to let these things go.' Because if we hold onto them, we might destroy them or they might never come out. There are all different types of artists and I think that some people like to hold onto things and they get very perfectionistic. But perfectionism is kind of a synonym for destruction. It can really be a deterrent for one's evolution. Alex and I have always felt that putting records out is very necessary. It's a gut feeling we have.\"Beach House's music has been sampled by prominent hip-hop and R&B artists. In 2011, The Weeknd sampled \"Master of None\" and \"Gila\" in his songs \"The Party & the After Party\" and \"Loft Music,\" respectively. Kendrick Lamar sampled \"Silver Soul\" for his hit \"Money Trees.\" The rap group G-Side sampled \"10 Mile Stereo\" in their song \"How Far.\"Beach House has also inspired songs and musicians. Pop duo The Chainsmokers wrote \"Beach House\" as an ode to listening to Beach House. Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips listed Beach House's album Bloom as one of the ten records that changed his life.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She worked for a year as stage manager of the Opera Company of Boston, but on the side began to write songs, record demo tapes, and take voice lessons. In 1990, Dar recorded her first album, I Have No History, produced by Jeannie Deva and engineered by Rob Lehmann at Oak Grove Studios in Malden, Massachusetts. One year later in 1991, Dar recorded her second album, All My Heroes Are Dead, most of which was recorded at Wellspring Sound in Newton, MA. This album included Dar's song \"Mark Rothko Song.\" The original recording of this song was later included in her third album The Honesty Room. In 1993 Williams moved to Northampton, Massachusetts. Early in Williams's music career, she opened for Joan Baez, who would make her relatively well known by recording some of her songs (Williams also dueted with Baez on Ring Them Bells). Her growing popularity has since relied heavily on community coffeehouses, public radio, and an extensive fan base on the Internet.Williams recorded her first full album, The Honesty Room, under her own label, Burning Field Music. Guest artists included Nerissa and Katryna Nields, Max Cohen and Gideon Freudmann. The album was briefly distributed by Chicago-based Waterbug Records. Williams soon secured a licensing-and-distribution deal for Burning Field with Razor and Tie, and in 1995 reissued the album on that label, with two re-recorded bonus tracks. The record went on to become one of the top-selling independent folk albums of the year. 1996's Mortal City, also licensed and distributed with Razor and Tie, received substantial notice, partially due to the fact that it coincided with her tour with Baez. The album again featured guest appearances by the Nields sisters and Freudmann, as well as noted folk artists John Prine, Cliff Eberhardt and Lucy Kaplansky. With that success, Razor & Tie re-released The Honesty Room. By the time of her third release, End of The Summer (1997), Williams's career had gathered substantial momentum, and the album did remarkably well, given its genre and independent label status.\nIn 1998, Williams, Richard Shindell and Lucy Kaplansky formed the group Cry Cry Cry as a way to pay homage to some of their favorite folk artists. The band released an eponymous album of covers and toured from 1998 to 2000. In June 2017, Cry Cry Cry reunited for the first time to play at the Clearwater Festival in New York.She has since released six more studio albums on the Razor & Tie label (The Green World (2000; which included \"Spring Street\", based on Spring Street in SoHo in Manhattan), The Beauty of the Rain (2003), My Better Self (2005), Promised Land (2008), Many Great Companions (2010), and In the Time of Gods (2012), as well as two live albums (Out There Live (2001) and Live at Bearsville Theater (2007)).\nWilliams founded the Snowden Environmental Trust and has been a part of many benefit concerts. She performed in a show at Alcatraz with Baez and the Indigo Girls, to benefit the prisoner-rights group Bread and Roses.\nAs someone who has toured a great deal of the time and had trouble finding suitable dining on the road, Williams was inspired to write and publish a directory of natural food stores and restaurants called The Tofu Tollbooth in 1994. In 1998 Williams co-authored a second edition with Elizabeth Zipern.Williams wrote a book, released on September 5, 2017, titled What I Found in a Thousand Towns: A Traveling Musicians Guide to Rebuilding America's Communities \u2013 One Coffee Shop, Dog Run, & Open-Mike Night at a Time, that focuses in part on rebuilding smaller cities and larger towns in America.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was developed by WayForward Technologies, using only five developers, the lead designer being Matt Bozon. It was designed for the sake of taking advantage of the Nintendo DS' features, though scaled to work with the DSiWare. Initially, the developers were contemplating the inclusion of enemies and items. They chose to leave enemies out of the game, feeling that if they had enemies, it would make the game too complicated. However, Matt commented that if players responded well to the game, they may implement enemies in a clever way next time. While the difficulty level was not designed to cater to younger or inexperienced players, the developers designed earlier levels to be more forgiving. They had younger players play it, and were surprised as to how far they could make it through. One of the developers, Mark Bozon, commented that it was as difficult to create the levels as it was for players to beat them, adding that they have to build the concept, account for player movements, and then ensure that players cannot exploit any mistakes in the level design.The developers used very little storage space in developing the game, attributing this to the small sprites, which allowed them to have improved audio and cutscenes. The developers took inspiration from multiple other video games, such as Wendy: Every Witch Way, which was developed by Mark and Matt Bozon, the former describing Mighty Flip Champs! as a spiritual successor to it. They also took inspiration from The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the idea of dimension traveling. Mark called it the \"grand daddy\" of the concept.

It was released in North America on June 1, 2009, and in the PAL regions on November 27, for the price of 800 DSi Points.

He is considered the most important Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His paintings, drawings, and engravings reflected contemporary historical upheavals and influenced important 19th- and 20th-century painters. Goya is often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns.Goya was born to a middle-class family in 1746, in Fuendetodos in Aragon. He studied painting from age 14 under Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n y Martinez and moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs. He married Josefa Bayeu in 1773. Goya became a court painter to the Spanish Crown in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and Rococo-style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace.\nAlthough Goya's letters and writings survive, little is known about his thoughts. He had a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 that left him deaf, after which his work became progressively darker and pessimistic. His later easel and mural paintings, prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social and political levels, and contrast with his social climbing. He was appointed Director of the Royal Academy in 1795, the year Manuel Godoy made an unfavorable treaty with France. In 1799, Goya became Primer Pintor de C\u00e1mara (Prime Court Painter), the highest rank for a Spanish court painter. In the late 1790s, commissioned by Godoy, he completed his La maja desnuda, a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. In 1800\u201301, he painted Charles IV of Spain and His Family, also influenced by Vel\u00e1zquez.\nIn 1807, Napoleon led the French army into the Peninsular War against Spain. Goya remained in Madrid during the war, which seems to have affected him deeply. Although he did not speak his thoughts in public, they can be inferred from his Disasters of War series of prints (although published 35 years after his death) and his 1814 paintings The Second of May 1808 and The Third of May 1808. Other works from his mid-period include the Caprichos and Los Disparates etching series, and a wide variety of paintings concerned with insanity, mental asylums, witches, fantastical creatures and religious and political corruption, all of which suggest that he feared for both his country's fate and his own mental and physical health.\nHis late period culminates with the Black Paintings of 1819\u20131823, applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the Quinta del Sordo (House of the Deaf Man) where, disillusioned by political and social developments in Spain, he lived in near isolation. Goya eventually abandoned Spain in 1824 to retire to the French city of Bordeaux, accompanied by his much younger maid and companion, Leocadia Weiss, who may have been his lover. There he completed his La Tauromaquia series and a number of other works. Following a stroke that left him paralyzed on his right side, Goya died and was buried on 16 April 1828 aged 82.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_53440", "text": "San Francisco Suite is an album by American pianist Freddie Redd recorded in 1957 and released on the Riverside label.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53731", "text": "Jesse Fuller (March 12, 1896 \u2013 January 29, 1976) was an American one-man band musician, best known for his song \"San Francisco Bay Blues\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41704", "text": "Goya: Crazy Like a Genius (2002), a documentary by Ian MacMillan, presented by Robert Hughes\nGoya's Ghosts (2006), directed by Milo\u0161 Forman\nVolav\u00e9runt (1999), directed by Bigas Luna and based on the novel by Antonio Larreta\nGoya in Bordeaux (1999), Spanish historical drama film written and directed by Carlos Saura about the life of Francisco de Goya\nGoya or the Hard Way to Enlightenment (1971) (German: Goya \u2013 oder der arge Weg der Erkenntnis) is a 1971 East German drama film directed by Konrad Wolf.

They popularised such old songs as \"D\u00falam\u00e1n\", \"Teidhir Abhaile Ri\u00fa\" and \"Coinleach Glas An Fh\u00f3mhair\", and these songs remained favourites at their concerts. After departing from their folk and traditional background in 1982, they created a new sound that was to define the meaning of New Age and Celtic music. When \"Theme from Harry's Game\" and \"Newgrange\" were first heard, radio stations all over the world were fascinated by an unearthly and spiritual sound that they had not heard before. One critic said \"the tunes were steeped in the old ways, but the production and the arrangement was fresh and inventive\". This transition in Clannad's career is often seen as the birth of Celtic music, and they are regarded as pioneers of the genre. They are also noted for their melodious harmonies, which have been at the heart of their music since their first album. Legend (1984) was based on English folklore, and with later albums Clannad delved further into the realms of electronica and pop. Many of their singles entered pop charts around the world and widened their fan base. Despite their success with this genre of music, the group maintained a link with their Gaelic roots, giving traditional Irish songs such as \"Tr\u00e1thn\u00f3na Beag Ar\u00e9ir\" and \"Buachaill \u00d3n \u00c9irne\" the Clannad treatment.\nWhile the rock-infused Sirius and the pop-inclined Macalla were successful, the style that the band created themselves has left the greatest legacy. Its influence can be found in the soundtrack of the film Titanic, where composer James Horner imitated Clannad's musical style and the soundtrack sounded so much like Clannad that it has been mistakenly attributed to them. The band's 'Celtic mysticism' is a recurring theme in the film Intermission. Lead singer Moya Brennan said that Clannad's \"otherworldly\" and \"ethereal\" sound came from the ancient hills and glens that surrounded Gweedore. Traces of Clannad's legacy can be heard in the music of many artists, including Enya, Altan, Capercaillie, The Corrs, Loreena McKennitt, An\u00fana, Riverdance, \u00d3rla Fallon and U2. Bono said Moya had \"one of the greatest voices the human ear has ever experienced\".A Japanese visual novel released in 2004, which spawned a 2007 film and a 2007\u201308 television series based on it, was named after the band because screenwriter Jun Maeda mistakenly believed it to mean the word \"family\" in Irish.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_41716", "text": "Clannad (Irish pronunciation: [\u02c8kl\u02e0an\u032a\u02e0\u0259d\u032a\u02e0]) are an Irish band formed in 1970 in Gweedore, County Donegal, by siblings Ciar\u00e1n, P\u00f3l and Moya Ui Bhraon\u00e1in (in English, Brennan) and their twin uncles Noel and P\u00e1draig \u00d3 D\u00fag\u00e1in (Duggan). They have adopted various musical styles throughout their history. Beginning as an acoustic folk group mainly performing rearranged traditional Irish songs in Irish, they expanded their sound with original songs in English, vocal harmonies, electronic keyboards, and elements of rock, Celtic, new age, smooth jazz, and Gregorian chant.Initially known as Clann as Dobhar ('Family from Dore'), they shortened their name to Clannad in 1973. By 1979 they had released three albums and toured Europe and the US. From 1980 to 1982 they operated as a six-piece with their sister and niece Eithne (Enya). In 1982 they gained international attention with their single \"Theme from Harry's Game\". They experimented with New Age and pop-influenced sounds in the 1980s and 1990s and their music came to be defined as almost purely Celtic, making them innovators of that genre. In 1997, after 15 albums, they took a break and pursued solo projects. The band regrouped in 2007 as a four piece with Moya, Ciar\u00e1n, Noel and P\u00e1draig and completed a world tour in 2008. In 2013, P\u00f3l rejoined and they released their first studio album in fifteen years.

He was taken on as band leader at Stockholm's Nalen and in 1945 the newly founded Swedish newspaper Expressen described him as the country's foremost clarinet player. Wickman considered himself self-taught; he never took classes on the instrument.\nHe led a band at Nalen for eleven years, and during the 1960s he ran the big band at Gr\u00f6na Lund and at Puttes, the club he co-owned, at Hornstull in Stockholm.

The film includes several flashbacks and crosscuts to other scenes giving additional information about those characters..\nAn opening intertitle extols the beauty of Varmland and the (fictional) estate of \"Ekeby.\"  A century earlier, the estate was home to a company of twelve \"Cavaliers,\" former soldiers who spend their time idly and often drunkenly as guests of Margaretha Samzelius, wife of a former army major and referred to as the \"Majoress.\"  On Christmas Eve, Gosta Berling, a defrocked Lutheran minister, leads evening revels and tricks the company with an appearance of a \"devil,\" played by Sintram, a household servant.\nEvents later that evening lead to a flashback when Berling was still a minister but on the verge of being removed from his parish by the presiding bishop because of his habitual drunkenness.  Berling gives such a moving sermon, though, that the parishioners and bishop are ready to forgive him until he begins to denounce their hypocrisy. Driven into exile, he becomes tutor to Ebba Dohna, stepdaughter of the mistress of Borg, an estate near Ekeby. The mother hopes to have Ebba marry Berling so that she will be disinherited for marrying a commoner, allowing the mother's natural son, Hendrik, to become heir to the estate.\nAt that time, Hendrik returns from a trip to Italy with his new wife, Elizabeth.  At dinner that night, Berling's past is exposed, devastating Ebba, who is in love with him, but rousing the sympathy of Elizabeth. Berling leaves Borg and is found half-frozen by Margaretha who brings him to Ekeby and makes him one of the Cavaliers. Berling eventually learns of Ebba's death, apparently from grief, and Margaretha tells him of how she had left home under the curse of her mother because of her own love for a man.\nLater, at a dinner party, Berling is one of several performers in pantomimes and skits.  In a scene with a young neighbor woman, Marianne Sinclaire, she kisses him, although the audience thinks it is part of the act.  Marianne's father, however, is outraged and leaves the party, with Marianne walking in the snow to their house, where her father refuses to let her in.  Back at the party, Margarethe's own past is exposed by one of the Cavaliers, and her husband the Major throws her out of the house. Disgusted with life, the Major gives control of Ekeby to the Cavaliers, bitterly predicting that they will ruin the estate.\nBerling searches for Margaretha but finds Marianne collapsed in the snow by her family's front door. Berling takes her back to Ekeby but tries to keep her presence confidential since she has fallen ill. In the meantime, Margarethe has returned to the cottage where her mother still lives, seeking forgiveness. As the old woman collapses and lies dying, there is a partial reconciliation but Margarethe realizes that she must atone for her past by driving the Cavaliers out of Ekeby.\nAt Borg, Hendrik learns that his Italian marriage to Elizabeth will not be considered legal until they both sign certain documents.  At Ekeby, Berling considers marriage to Marianne, but she turns him away when she reveals that her face has been scarred by smallpox.  Margarethe, driven by her own guilt and rage, assembles a party to set fire to the wing of Ekeby housing the Cavaliers in order to capture and exile them, but the fire gets out of control and begins to burn the central mansion housing Marianne, whom Berling manages to save from the flames just as her father arrives, now relieved that his daughter is safe.\nAt Borg, seeing the fire, Elizabeth heads across the lake to Ekeby on foot, where she is discovered by Berling who was driving a sleigh across the ice.  At first, in a fit of passion, Berling proposes eloping and taking Elizabeth away from V\u00e4rmland and beyond.  But he turns the sleigh back when he realizes that they are being pursued on the frozen lake by a pack of wolves, which they eventually outrun.\nBack at Borg, Hendrik offers Elizabeth the new wedding documents to sign and legalize their marriage, but she has to confess that she has not given her heart to him, leading to the ultimate dashing of Hendrik's mother's hopes.  Elizabeth goes to live with the Sinclaires, where she and Marianne become good friends. On a visit to Margarethe in her mother's cottage, Elizabeth confesses her love for Berling, who had just entered the room without her noticing. Inspired by Marianne, Berling oversees the reconstruction of Ekeby. Finally, Margarathe returns to the newly built estate, which she now offers as a home to Berling and Elizabeth.

It was released as a launch title for the Xbox 360 video game console in 2005. The game is part of the Perfect Dark series and a prequel to the original Perfect Dark. The story of the game follows Joanna Dark, a bounty hunter working with her father and a computer hacker, as she joins the Carrington Institute agency to prevent a rival corporation from gaining possession of an ancient artefact which endows individuals with superhuman powers.\nPerfect Dark Zero features a campaign mode consisting of 14 missions that can be played solo or co-operatively, and a multiplayer mode where a maximum of 32 players can compete against each other in numerous types of deathmatch and objective-based games. Both the co-operative and multiplayer modes support split screen, system link, and the Xbox Live online service. The game was under development for five years and was originally intended to be released for the GameCube and later the Xbox. During development, several intended features were canceled so that the game could meet the Xbox 360 launch.\nUpon release, Perfect Dark Zero sold more than one million copies worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its graphics and numerous multiplayer modes. However, some critics felt that the game did not meet expectations, criticising single-player aspects such as its story and voice acting.

At E3 2001, Nintendo advertised the title \"Perfect Dark Zero\" on a list of upcoming GameCube releases, but the list was quickly removed. In January 2002, it was reported that Perfect Dark Zero was delayed until at least 2004 due to internal team problems at Rare. When Rare was purchased by Microsoft in September 2002, several images of Joanna Dark were released, but few other official announcements were made in the following years.In May 2005, one of the rewards in the OurColony viral marketing campaign for the Xbox 360 console was a new image of Joanna Dark. At the official unveiling of the Xbox 360, it was announced that Perfect Dark Zero would be a launch title for the new system in the fall of 2005. A demo was shown at E3 2005 shortly afterwards. Prior to its release, Microsoft arranged a deal with Tor Books to produce novels set in the Perfect Dark universe. A six-issue comic book series written by Eric Trautmann and illustrated by Cold FuZion Studios was also announced. Around the same time, Joanna Dark made an appearance on the cover of FHM magazine. An official soundtrack album featuring a selection of music from the game was produced by Nile Rodgers and released on November 8, 2005 through Sumthing Else Music Works.Perfect Dark Zero was first released in North America on November 22, 2005 .

The European release followed on December 2, 2005, while the Japanese version was released on December 10, 2005. In Europe, Microsoft organized a party by simulating an apartment as Joanna's home, where several journalists could play the Xbox 360. During the Japanese launch weekend, Perfect Dark Zero became the second best-selling Xbox 360 game with roughly 15,000 units sold, behind Namco's Ridge Racer 6. Standard and limited collector's editions of the game were made available for purchase. The collector's edition included a disc with behind-the-scenes content, a black metal game case, a special edition comic booklet that sets the scene for the game, and one of nine holographic collectible cards.

The combat features mechanics such as an evasive dodge roll and a cover system in which the gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to aim strategically without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles as long as they can reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. When doing so the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took.Players can only carry a limited number of weapons since the inventory features a 4-slot system in which single hand-held pistols usually take a weapon slot, whereas heavy weapons like sniper rifles or rocket launchers can take up to three weapon slots. The player's movement speed is also altered by the weight of the weapon the player is currently holding. Besides the primary function, all of the weapons in Perfect Dark Zero have one or two additional function modes that generally grant the player with special abilities. For example, the Shockwave Rifle features an X-ray function which allows the player to see enemies through walls, while the Plasma Rifle has a cloak function that renders the player character invisible to enemies at the cost of its battery charge. Some weapons also feature more unorthodox secondary functions. For instance, the Laptop Gun can be deployed as a sentry gun, while the SuperDragon assault rifle can launch bouncing grenades.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_40368", "text": "Eternal Melody is the first classical studio album by Japanese musician Yoshiki.

Writing for GameSpot, Greg Kasavin felt that Perfect Dark Zero \"champions the Xbox 360 with its excellent assortment of single and multiplayer game types, as well as its incredible good looks and dynamic, intense action\". He concluded that the game \"delivers just about everything you could hope for from a first-person shooter\". Charles Onyett of IGN praised the game's replay value, but also criticised single-player aspects such as the weak artificial intelligence of enemies, commenting that \"they never display any advanced assault tactics\".The graphics were highlighted positively. Kasavin was impressed with the amount of lighting and motion blur effects, and noted that the \"excellent character animation helps make the guns feel as powerful as they look\". Bryn Williams of GameSpy considered the graphics as a \"stunning look at what the 360 hardware is capable of\", but also admitted that the animation \"is a little too slow and sometimes creates an unwelcome sense of cartoonishness\". IGN credited the attractive gun models, explosions, and sprawling vistas, but felt that some areas such as the South American Ruins can unnecessarily look too shiny. The game's audio was said to feature \"heavy-hitting weapon effects [and] fantastic, moody soundtrack that gives each mission its own pulsing rhythms\".The game's weapons were very well received. Edge praised their weight, stating that each weapon encourages strategic play with their secondary functions. Critics generally agreed that the roll and cover system worked well and that they did not feel overpowered, but some criticised the fact that players need to be in a specific spot to use the cover mode. Reviewers considered the story and voice acting to be weak. IGN said that it is almost impossible not to notice how \"laughably bad it is\", and that many plot twists are presented then never resolved, but also admitted that it does not really factor into the gameplay. GameCritics reviewer Mike Bracken commented: \"It's always sad when there's voice acting in a game and I find myself being embarrassed for the voice actors\". Nevertheless, GameSpot added that the weapon sound effects and musical score \"easily drown this out\".Publications judged the co-op aspect of the game well. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer praised the fact that the missions were \"designed with co-op in mind\". He noted that, for example, the third level \"has Joanna providing cover fire for her father Jack as he hops from one point of the level to the next. In the single player campaign Jack's [computer-controlled], but co-op lets you take direct control of his actions, making the experience a much more engaging affair all-round\". Multiplayer matches of Perfect Dark Zero were widely well received. GameSpot stated that \"the excellent weapon selection, flexibility of options, high-quality maps, and smooth online performance ... make for a rock-solid competitive shooter\". IGN stated similar pros, calling it \"enormous\". 1Up.com reviewer Che Chou also praised the multiplayer, but observed that \"constantly roll-dodging to avoid enemy fire at close range [...] combined with the exceptionally slow movement speed of your character [...] can occasionally be highly frustrating for beginners\".Despite solid reviews, numerous publications remarked that Perfect Dark Zero did not meet expectations. According to GameCritics, \"it took Rare a whole console generation to do it [...] and the wait wasn't really worth it\". Game Informer found the game underwhelming, reviewing it under the tagline \"Don't believe the hype\". In a positive review, GameSpy praised Perfect Dark Zero for doing many things well, but acknowledge that it was not a killer-app. Edge said that the game \"falls short\", especially when compared to Halo: Combat Evolved, a successful first-person shooter that was released as a launch title for the original Xbox. At the 2005 Spike Video Game Awards, Perfect Dark Zero was nominated for Best Original Score and Best First Person Action, while Joanna Dark was nominated for Cyber Vixen of the Year. At IGN's Best of 2005 awards, Perfect Dark Zero won Best Offline Multiplayer Game and Best Xbox Live Game in the Xbox 360 categories, and was nominated for Best First-Person Shooter, also in the Xbox 360 categories. Similarly, at GameSpot's Best of 2005 awards, the game was nominated for Best Original Music, Best Multiplayer Game, Best Shooter, and Best Xbox 360 Game.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

The notable maturity in her lyrics and worldly warmth of her vocal reflect the growth that she has continually strived to attain.\" British magazine Music Week gave it four out of five, adding, \"This is as smooth as any of her ballads, but it's in the vocals where the difference lies. No longer over-singing for the sake of it, Carey has rarely sounded more stunning.\" Rick Juzwiak from Slant Magazine gave the song a mixed review, but felt it was a pivotal part of Carey's vocal and musical transition. Juzwiak wrote \"The agonizingly slow 'Butterfly,' with its predictably soaring chorus and if-it-comes-back-it-was-meant-to-be message, would have been ignorable tripe.

Under the pseudonym \"Juliette Jansen\" she interviewed celebrities such as Erich von Stroheim, Jean Cocteau, Jean Marais, Charles Trenet and Maurice Chevalier. She also began writing narrative adaptations and scenarios for comic strips that ran in some of the daily newspapers in Paris under the aegis of Opera Mundi. Collaborating with artists Robert Bressy she wrote dialogue for the serial soap Dr. Claudette and Dr. Fu Manchu.In 1959 she participated in the popular television quiz show Le Gros Lot. The topic was the Italian Renaissance, and the subject was Catherina Sforza. In spite of floundering on the second-to-last question, the next day she was summoned by G\u00e9rald Gauthier, director of the Press Agency at Op\u00e9ra Mundi. Impressed by her historical knowledge, he asked her if she could write a historical novel in the same style as the Angelique series, (by Anne Golon), which Op\u00e9ra Mundi had published with great success in 1956. Benzoni agreed, already having an idea inspired by the legend of the Golden Fleece, and began to write the adventures of a golden-haired beauty during the Hundred Years' War.\nCatherine was released in 1962 as a cliffhanger in the daily newspaper France-Soir as Il suffit d'un amour (One Love is Enough). In 1963 newspaper Le Figaro wrote: \u201cbefore the book was even published it beats all records: it is already sold to ten different countries\u201d. France-Soir confirmed: \u201cit has an unprecedented destiny in the history of publishing...\u201d On 10 June 1964 Le Proven\u00e7alwrote: \u201cA heroine \u2013 who takes place \u2013 alongside Scarlett O'Hara and The Marquise of the Angels\u201d (Ang\u00e9lique). \nEditions Tr\u00e9vise had in 1962, already published two collections of her short stories- La Reines tragiques and Aventuries du pass\u00e9, but it was the Catherine novels that launched her career as a bestselling author.\nIn August 1964 Benzoni was invited to a cocktail party in London by Heinemann Ltd to introduce Catherine, One Love is Enough. There followed an interview with BBC radio reporter Leigh Crutchley introducing \"Countess Juliette Benzoni di Conza\" to the English press.\nInspired by the success, Benzoni continued to write. Seventeen historical series (sixty-five books), a collection of eighteen short story novels, three stand alone novels, all in all eighty-six books, followed. For her researches Benzoni was often seen at the local library \"Monaco\" in Saint-Mand\u00e9. She travelled all over the world to visit castles, museums, monasteries, libraries and villages for her work. Sometimes a museum painting would inspire a new story. She never kept a computer; each morning at six-thirty she got up and started writing on her old electric typewriter and wrote three pages \u2013 never missing a day, even on Sundays.\nFrom time to time she appeared on television to introduce one of her new books or to give an interview at a radio station.\nIn 1965 a song was composed by Paul Amar, text by J. Benzoni, called Catherine, il suffit d'un amour, sung first by Mich\u00e8le Arnaud and later Bernard St\u00e9phane.\nShe met many members of the nobility, historians, authors, professors, directors and entertainers. Benzoni and historian Alain Decaux were mutual admirers. He wrote the preface for her book Par le Fer ou le Poison, where he mentioned her love of Alexander Dumas, and said \"vous aidez \u00e0 faire aimer l\u2019histoire aux Fran\u00e7ais\" (you help the French love history).American President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy sent her a letter from the White House, after reading her first novel of the Le Gerfaut series (The Lure of the Falcon).One of the factors in Benzoni's success as a Romanci\u00e8re was based on her thorough historical research. She wrote a series of books based on the histories of the castles in France, Le Roman des Ch\u00e2teaux de France, with a foreword by St\u00e9phane Bern, journalist and moderator.\nAlthough her later works were not widely translated, in 1984, she was one of the top ten female French writers whose works were translated into English.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She was a stellar pianist at a very young age and was able to compose her first hymn by the age of 10. She decided to study music at the age of 12. Smyth first studied with Alexander Ewing when she was 17. He introduced her to the music of Wagner and Berlioz. After a major battle with her father about her plans to devote her life to music, Smyth was allowed to advance her musical education at the Leipzig Conservatory, where she studied Brahmsian musical composition with Carl Reinecke. She left after a year, however, disillusioned with the low standard of teaching, and continued her music studies privately with Heinrich von Herzogenberg. While at the Leipzig Conservatory, Smyth met Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Grieg and Tchaikovsky. Through Herzogenberg, she also met Clara Schumann and Brahms. Upon her return to England, Smyth formed a supportive friendship with Arthur Sullivan in the last years of his life; he respected her and encouraged her work.\n\nSmyth's extensive body of work includes the Concerto for Violin, Horn and Orchestra and the Mass in D. It was the latter's performance in London's Albert Hall in 1893 that helped her gain recognition as a serious composer. Her opera The Wreckers is considered by some critics to be the \"most important English opera composed during the period between Purcell and Britten.\" Her best known work, she composed it to a French libretto by Henry Brewster. It premiered in 1906. In 2022 it received its first professional production in its original French text at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera. It was also performed at the BBC Proms, where its prelude or overture was presented 27 times between 1913 and 1947.Another of her operas, Der Wald, mounted in 1903, was, for more than a century, the only opera by a woman composer ever produced at New York's Metropolitan Opera (until Kaija Saariaho's L'Amour de loin in December 2016).On 28 May 1928, the nascent BBC broadcast two concerts of Smyth's music, marking her \"musical jubilee\", The first comprised chamber music, the second, conducted by Smyth herself, choral works. Otherwise, recognition in England came somewhat late for Smyth, wrote the conductor Leon Botstein at the time he conducted the American Symphony Orchestra's US premiere of The Wreckers in New York on 30 September 2007:\nOn her seventy-fifth birthday in 1934, under Beecham's direction, her work was celebrated in a festival, the final event of which was held at the Royal Albert Hall in the presence of the Queen. Heartbreakingly, at this moment of long-overdue recognition, the composer was already completely deaf and could hear neither her own music nor the adulation of the crowds.\nAfter her release from prison, Smyth composed her final major work, the hour-long vocal symphony The Prison, setting a text by Henry Bennett Brewster. It was first performed in 1931. The first recording was issued by Chandos in 2020. Smyth\u2019s composing and conducting career came to a premature end before the 1920s as she started to develop hearing loss, which eventually led to her becoming completely deaf.[1] However, she found a new interest in literature and, between 1919 and 1940, she published ten highly successful, mostly autobiographical, books.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "136_42063", "text": "Ethel Smyth featured, under the name of Edith Staines, in E.

The game's ongoing storyline revolves around the fictional desert planet \"Rubi-Ka\", the source of a valuable mineral known as \"Notum\". Players assume the role of a new colonist to Rubi-Ka.

The game world is occupied by human players and computer-controlled characters, both friendly and hostile. The game begins with the player creating a unique character, choosing its name, gender, height, weight, and facial features. Each character is also one of the four humanoid \"breeds\". The final choice is that of the character's profession, similar to the character classes of other role-playing games.\nThe game's multiplayer nature and \"free-form\" gameplay encourage creating personal networks, and cooperating and fighting with other players. Players interact with Anarchy Online's interface via a keyboard and mouse. The game's heads-up display consists of a series of windows, menus and buttons located on the periphery of the screen. Players communicate with each other by typing text in chat windows, and occasionally through emotive character animations. Communication with computer-controlled characters is executed via text windows, in which players chose from a menu of possible responses to the conversation being shown. Like most role playing games, Anarchy Online provides structure for role-playing events. Most major cities include night clubs and other venues specifically for this. Events are organized either by players, or officially by Funcom staff.Groups of players, large or small, are often required to complete objectives. In addition to forming teams and informal chat groups, joining a player organization is encouraged. These are, like guilds in similar games, officially recognized groups bound together for technical and social benefits. Organizations are able to build their own cities across the game world, control areas of land, run player markets, and access other special content.Among the most distinct gameplay elements of Anarchy Online are dynamic missions. Missions, or quests, are a traditional gameplay element in the role playing genre. The player or team is given a set of tasks\u2014usually related to the story\u2014to complete somewhere in the game world; in return, they are rewarded with experience points, items, and money. Dynamic missions are similar to traditional missions in purpose, but are created at the player's request. Once they choose its difficulty and other options, the game generates a new indoor area filled with computer-controlled enemies. The player or team are told to go to its location, and finish some task inside for their reward.

In an interview with HitQuarters, one of the songwriters of the song, Andreas Carlsson, claimed that he worked together with Perry and Desmond Child to write \"Waking Up in Vegas\". Carlsson remarked that they \"really wanted to tell the story that described that moment when everybody's checking out on Vegas after they've had their fun. And Katy is the perfect artist to tell such a story \u2013 she has humour, and she knows how to deliver it.\" Carlsson also said that two of the first aspects of the song to be composed were the main guitar riff \u2013 which he already had pre-prepared \u2013 and the phrase \"put your money where your mouth is,\" which they were very keen to use and which for a time was almost used as the song's title.\nIn an interview for Pop Eater, Perry revealed the inspiration behind the track:\n\nWhat inspired it [was] this boy I was dating at the time. I was 21. We went to Vegas on a whim and we decided to get fake married. We took all the pictures with the minister, with the fake cake, in the fake chapel and got a fake marriage certificate. We went and bought a wedding dress and a suit at a thrift store, and scanned the pictures and the certificate to my family members, my manager at the time [and] totally freaked the shit out of them.

I still have the wedding dress and the certificate.\n\"Waking Up in Vegas\" was eventually picked as the album's fourth and final single, being sent to US radio stations on April 21, 2009. On the single's artwork, Perry is seen with two dice behind her, giving more emphasis to the song's lyrical content of being in Vegas.

The album contains a highly diverse musical composition, highlighted by Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian as \"darting efficiently from EDM to Bollywood\".

August Brown of the Los Angeles Times called Stars Dance a \"sassy\" pop-EDM album, noting its composition included \"oxygen-sucking\" sub-bass, trap snares. Brown noted the influence of Spring Breakers on the album, saying that Gomez wasn't ready to leave the \"neon-splattered emotional hellscape of Spring Breakers just yet\". He further went on to say: \"Stars Dance is exactly the kind of album one makes in 2013 if you want to keep the pop sugar of the Disney tween cabal but mix in some broken glass and a club bathroom nosebleed.

When talking about the song \"Save the Day\", Gomez stated \"Do you ever have moments where you don't ever want them to end? I've had those moments. It's about saving those moments and never wanting it to go away.\" The song \"Write Your Name\" is about the feeling of falling in love. Gomez described B.E.A.T. by saying \"The song is cool and the lyrics are great, but it was more, 'I can't wait to perform this song onstage because I love the way I feel when I hear this song.' It's just dope.\" Gomez later stated that \"Undercover\" was her favorite song on the album, commenting \"I've never had the confidence to do different licks and melody changes. I messed up a lot [while recording] that one.\" The album's lead single, \"Come & Get It\", has been described as featuring \"Bollywood\" influences, as well as tribal music.On-air personality Peter Dee noted that the song featured various electropop elements. \"Slow Down\" is noted as featuring various dubstep influences, while the song's lyrics speak of taking a relationship slowly rather than rushing into things. Gomez has listed Britney Spears and Janet Jackson as some of the album's biggest influences, and later cited Skrillex, Taylor Swift, and Christina Aguilera as major influences on the record. She listed dubstep producer Skrillex as an influence to the album, with him having previously worked on the soundtrack for Gomez's film Spring Breakers. She later stated \"Doing Spring Breakers was really fun, because Skrillex and Cliff Martinez did the soundtrack, and [Skrillex] kind of inspired me with a baby dubstep, because I have a few songs that have that.\" Jim Farber of New York Daily News noted influences of Spears, Jennifer Lopez, and Janet Jackson, although going on to say \"Gomez's writer and producers have aped other stars' tricks gamely enough to create a pretty good time.

Adam Romano from Defunct Games noted that Neutopia was released two years before The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and said that Neutopia \"kept pace with or were actually ahead of the Nintendo curve\". He said that gameplay and backgrounds remain varied and that \"the fire rod weapon is especially fun to wield\", but noted that the things that keep the game from being better than Zelda were repetitive and frustrating dungeon exploring, boring boss battles, long passwords (for those who do not own a TurboGrafx-CD), and several \"head-scratching moments\" which include references to Judaism and Islam as well as quotes from Star Wars. Marcel van Duyn from Nintendo Life noted many similarities to Zelda, including the existence of 8 dungeons and medallions, the need to blow up walls or burn bushes to uncover secrets, the dungeon designs, and the need to push blocks to uncover staircases. However, he noted that what sets it apart from Zelda are the fire rod, the ability to warp with wings, and a lower difficulty level. He concluded that the game, while copying Zelda, might be better as it added additional features that set it apart. Destructoid's Tony Ponce compared the game's copying of Zelda to China Warrior's copying of Kung-Fu Master, and he pointed out what are also considered Zelda clones such as Crusader of Centy and Alundra for the Sega Genesis and PlayStation, respectively.GameSpot's Austin Shau reviewed Neutopia in November 2007 and said progression through the game was \"quick and direct\" but was also more linear, unlike with Zelda. He praised the game for its variety of environments, which he said \"helps to combat monotony\", but he noted the lack of detail in the graphics itself.

He criticized another difference from Zelda, that Neutopia had poor collision detection, saying that it can lead to additional damage to Jazeta, which causes the power of the fire rod to decrease and lead to the annoying \"beeping sound\" just as in Zelda.

Butler-Jones (vocals/guitar) and Thom Sullivan (drums).\nThe quartet recorded the six-track EP Closer to Doom in spring 1995, co-produced by Sylvia Massy. Closer to Doom was released in 1996 and established them as 'fathers' of the psychedelic doom movement that spawned the Los Angeles stoner rock scene.\nThe first line-up change came when Steve Frothingham replaced Sullivan in late 1995; soon afterward founding member Richard Anton exited the band.\nContinuing as a three-piece, they recorded Money Machine in summer 1997, which Swedish label Record Heaven eventually released in 2000. This led the band to tour Scandinavia, where they became a quartet again with the addition of Finnish bass player Duffy Snowhill, who debuted on their six-track EP Goatbridge Palace. Recorded in Stockholm in December 2000, it featured the singles \"(Another)Nervous Breakdown\" and \"Side Effects\" plus four live tracks, one being a cover of the Black Sabbath classic \"Sweet Leaf\".

It is a major installment in the Resident Evil series, and was announced in 2005\u2014the same year its predecessor Resident Evil 4 was released. Resident Evil 5 was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in March 2009 and for Windows in September 2009. It was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016. The plot involves an investigation of a terrorist threat by Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance agents Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar in Kijuju, a fictional region of West Africa. Chris learns that he must confront his past in the form of an old enemy, Albert Wesker, and his former partner, Jill Valentine.\nThe gameplay of Resident Evil 5 is similar to that of the previous installment, though it is the first in the series designed for two-player cooperative gameplay. It has also been considered the first game in the main series to depart from the survival horror genre, with critics saying it bore more resemblance to an action game. Motion capture was used for the cutscenes, and it was the first video game to use a virtual camera system. Several staff members from the original Resident Evil worked on Resident Evil 5. The Windows version was developed by Mercenary Technology.\nResident Evil 5 received a positive reception, despite some criticism for its control scheme. The game received some complaints of racism, though an investigation by the British Board of Film Classification found the complaints were unsubstantiated. As of December 2023, when including the original, special and remastered versions, the game had sold 13.4 million units.

Keiji Inafune, promotional producer for Resident Evil 2 and executive producer of the PlayStation 2 version of Resident Evil 4, supervised the project. Production began in 2005 and at its peak, over 100 people were working on the project. In February 2007, some members of Capcom's Clover Studio began working on Resident Evil 5 while others were working on Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles, which debuted for the Wii. Yasuhiro Anpo, who worked as a programmer on the original Resident Evil, directed Resident Evil 5. He was one of several staff members who worked on the original game to be involved in Resident Evil 5's development. The game's scenario was written by Haruo Murata and Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, based on a story idea by concept director Kenichi Ueda. Takeuchi announced that the game would retain the gameplay model introduced in Resident Evil 4, with \"thematic tastes\" from both Resident Evil 4 and the original Resident Evil.While previous Resident Evil games are mainly set at night, the events of Resident Evil 5 occur almost entirely during the day. The decision for this was a combination of the game being set in Africa and advances in hardware improvements which allowed increasingly detailed graphics. On the subject of changes to Jill and Chris's appearance, production director Yasuhiro Anpo explained that designers tried \"to preserve their image and imagined how they would have changed over the passage of time\". Their new designs retained the character's signature colors; green for Chris and blue for Jill. Sheva was redesigned several times during production, though all versions tried to emphasize a combination of \"feminine attraction and the strength of a fighting woman\". The Majini were designed to be more violent than the \"Ganado\" enemies in Resident Evil 4.The decision for cooperative gameplay was made part-way through development, for a new experience in a Resident Evil game. Despite initial concern that a second player would dampen the game's tension and horror, it was later realized that this could actually increase such factors where one player had to be rescued. The decision to retain wide-screen proportions in two-player mode was made to avoid having the first player's screen directly on top of the second, which might be distracting, and the restriction on simultaneously moving and shooting was retained to increase player tension by not allowing them to maneuver freely. Takeuchi cited the film Black Hawk Down as an influence on the setting of Resident Evil 5 and his experience working on Lost Planet: Extreme Condition as an influence on its development. When questioned as to why the game was not being released on the Wii, which was the most popular gaming console at that time, Takeuchi responded that although that may have been a good decision \"from a business perspective\", the Wii was not the best choice in terms of power and visual quality, concluding that he was happy with the console choices they had made.Resident Evil 5 runs on version 1.4 of Capcom's MT Framework engine and scenes were recorded by motion capture. It was the first video game to use a virtual camera system, which allowed the developers to see character movements in real time as the motion-capture actors recorded. Actors Reuben Langdon, Karen Dyer and Ken Lally portrayed Chris Redfield, Sheva Alomar and Albert Wesker respectively. Dyer also voiced Sheva, while Chris's voice was performed by Roger Craig Smith. Dyer's background training in circus skills helped her win the role of Sheva, as Capcom were searching for someone who could handle the physical skills her motion capture required. She performed her own stunts, and worked in production on the game for over a year, sometimes working 14 hours a day. All of the human character motions were based on motion capture, while the non-human characters in the game were animated by hand.Kota Suzuki was the game's principal composer and additional music was contributed by Hideki Okugawa, Akihiko Narita and Seiko Kobuchi. The electronic score includes 15 minutes of orchestral music, recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage of 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles with the 103-piece Hollywood Studio Symphony. Other orchestral music and arrangements were by Wataru Hokoyama, who conducted the orchestra. Capcom recorded in Los Angeles because they wanted a Hollywood-style soundtrack to increase the game's cinematic value and global interest. Resident Evil 5's soundtrack features an original theme song, titled \"Pray\", which was composed by Suzuki and sung by Oulimata Niang.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Their influences included bluegrass, folk, punk, and other musical styles. The original lineup, formed in 1990, included Danny Barnes on banjo, guitar and resonator guitar, Mark Rubin on upright bass and tuba, and Ralph White III on fiddle and accordion. Barnes composed the majority of the group's original songs. When White left the group at the end of 1996, he was briefly replaced by Bob Grant on mandolin and guitar. Barnes and Rubin then continued to perform and record as a duo until unofficially dissolving the band in 2000. The band has neither toured nor recorded since then, but Barnes and Rubin have played a few live shows with Grant in 2008, 2009, and 2014.The Bad Livers' music has often been cited for its influence on other groups, creating what The Austin Chronicle described as \"an impressive legacy\". The Stranger credited them with \"revitalizing roots music\", and, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, \"The Bad Livers helped open the way for old-time and bluegrass bands of today\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_42354", "text": "The Bad Livers formed in 1990, when Barnes \"came up with this idea that it would be great to have a small-format acoustic band that could play different kinds of music [at a] virtuoso level, where they could play any kind of music\". He began playing with Rubin and White, and the trio adopted the name Bad Livers in the summer of 1990. They began playing frequently in Austin, including a weekly set at the Saxon Pub. A typical set in 1991 included a wide variety of styles and periods of music, as Rubin later explained: \"We were doing Mississippi John Hurt, gospel tunes, Captain Beefheart\u2014anything, really, but it was Mot\u00f6rhead or the Misfits that caught on.\"Imprecise descriptions of the Bad Livers' music abounded: \"thrash-grass\", \"acoustic bluegrass with a punk death wish\", \"something called 'contemporary bluegrass,'\" and \"acoustic-metal-bluegrass\", although these same sources would cite the band as \"much-lauded\" and note that \"the musicians can really play\". The recurrence of the term bluegrass, however bizarrely it was modified, along with counter-assessments of them as \"good, faithful traditionalists\" who \"preserve the spirit as well as the technique of old-timey folk music\", created a generic perplexity that led Austin country legend Don Walser to observe that the only question he couldn't answer was what kind of music the Bad Livers played.Barnes insisted that the Bad Livers were not a bluegrass band, but had created an original sound: \"This isn't bluegrass and it isn't this or that. It's Bad Liver music. We end up making our own thing.\" Barnes' original compositions were featured on their first album, Delusions of Banjer, released in 1992 on Quarterstick Records and produced by Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers. The album was praised for \"Barnes's strong material, as well as the group's tight musical interaction\". Barnes credited the latter with improving the former: \"The musical telepathy is really good. I can sort of tailor-make a song to the guys' playing, make the song fit what they're doing, since I write most of the material.\"Rubin claimed that they had decided to incorporate the accordion and tuba into the band to counteract their growing popularity, but to no avail: their audience continued to widen and more critics saw beyond the gimmicky descriptions to the band's innovation and skill. The Washington Post described them as \"truly great\", The Times-Picayune praised their \"serious musicianship\" and Barnes' \"soulful, urgent lead vocals\", while Rolling Stone admired their \"striking blend of virtuoso flash and poignant simplicity\". Don McLeese of the Austin American-Statesman twice described the Bad Livers as \"Austin's best band\" and raved of one live show: \"The uncommon telepathy enjoyed by Danny Barnes, Mark Rubin and Ralph White makes the band's frenetic acoustic interplay sound like the work of a six-armed, multistringed monster.\" Barnes was voted \"Best Player of Any Other Instrument\" for the banjo at the Austin Music Awards in 1991 and 1992, and the Bad Livers were voted \"Best None of the Above\" for four consecutive years from 1991 to 1994.The Bad Livers' second album, Horses in the Mines, was produced by Barnes and released on Quarterstick in 1994. In his review, McLeese admired them as \"a band drawing from the wellspring of tradition to create something fresh, vital and original\". S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung found that the record \"sounded quite authentic\u2014almost as if it had long held a place in the Library of Congress\". Raoul Hern\u00e1ndez poetically concurred, saying that the record sounded \"like a bunch of skeletons cackling into the sole microphone that dangles from the outhouse ceiling\".The Bad Livers spent 1995 and 1996 touring and working on side projects as well as looking for a new label to release their next album. Finally the band signed a three-album deal with Sugar Hill Records, which had more experience than Quarterstick at \"selling banjo records\". Their first album for the label, Hogs on the Highway, was released along with the information that White had decided to leave the band. It was announced that he was to be replaced by Bob Grant, though Grant's tenure with the band did not last long. Both White and Grant appeared on Hogs on the Highway, which received enthusiastic reviews from Sing Out!, praising Barnes' \"quirky and inventive\" original songs, and the Old-Time Herald, admiring the \"considerable skill\" with which Barnes crafted his lyrics. The Austin American-Statesman agreed that Barnes was \"an entirely underrated songwriter\" as well as a \"banjo wizard\", while The Washington Post lauded his \"timeless, deadpan voice\". The Sydney Morning Herald was appreciative of the \"beautifully controlled ambience\" of the entire album.\nShortly after the album's release, Barnes moved from Austin to Port Hadlock, Washington, though he and Rubin continued to work closely together on the score for the Richard Linklater film The Newton Boys as well as the Bad Livers' next album. Although the soundtrack was admired by The Village Voice and Entertainment Weekly as well as the Austin papers, the film did not fare well at the box office, and the soundtrack album did not sell well. The Bad Livers' second album for Sugar Hill, Industry and Thrift, was released in September 1998 with only Barnes and Rubin credited as members of the band, though the album features various guest musicians, including members of Rubin's side project, Rubinchik\u2019s Orkestyr, who are featured on the track \"A Yid Ist Geboren inz Oklahoma\".

After Bass left Sain's band for a solo career, she was replaced by Barbara Carr, who continued to sing with Sain until 1972.He set up his own recording studio, Archway, in St Louis in 1965, and recorded and produced artists such as the Montclairs and Julius Hemphill, developing \"a distinctively full, dynamic sound that would come to help define the St. Louis soul aesthetic.\"  He released his first album, Main Man, in 1972, followed by Bus Stop in 1974. The track \"Booty Bumpin' (The Double Bump)\" from the latter album was issued as a single, and reached number 78 in the R&B chart.  \"Party Hearty\", taken from his 1975 album Blue Max, reached number 16 on the R&B chart, and its flip side, \"She's a Disco Queen\", bubbled under the Hot 100.
