He played 19 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Islanders, Florida Panthers, and the Vancouver Canucks. In 2022, Luongo was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Luongo is a two-time NHL All-Star (2004 and 2007) and a winner of the William M. Jennings Trophy for backstopping his team to the lowest goals against average in the league (2011, with backup Cory Schneider). He was a finalist for several awards, including the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender (2004, 2007, and 2011), the Lester B. Pearson Award as the top player voted by his peers (2004 and 2007), and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player (2007). Luongo is second all time in games played as an NHL goaltender (1,044) and fourth all time in wins (489). He employed the butterfly style of goaltending.Born in Montreal, Quebec, Luongo is of Italian and Irish ancestry. Prior to his NHL career, he played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the Val-d'Or Foreurs and the Acadie-Bathurst Titan, winning back-to-back President's Cups and establishing the league's all-time play-off records in games played and wins. Following his second QMJHL season, Luongo was selected fourth overall by the Islanders in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. After splitting his professional rookie season between the Islanders and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters in 1999\u20132000, he was traded to the Panthers. In five seasons with Florida, Luongo established team records for most games played, wins and shutouts; despite several strong seasons, however, the Panthers remained a weak team and were unable to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs during Luongo's initial stint with the team. During the 2006 off-season, he was traded to the Canucks after failed contract negotiations with the Panthers.\nIn his first season in Vancouver, Luongo won 47 games, and was runner-up in voting for both the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP) and Vezina Trophy (best goaltender). Following his second year with the Canucks, he became the first NHL goaltender to serve as a team captain since Bill Durnan in the 1947\u201348 season. Luongo served in that capacity for two seasons before resigning from the position in September 2010. In the subsequent 2010\u201311 season, he helped the Canucks to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals but lost to the Boston Bruins. During his eight-year tenure with Vancouver, Luongo became the team's all-time leader in wins and shutouts. He returned to the Panthers during the 2013\u201314 season, where he spent the remainder of his career, qualifying for the playoffs with the Panthers only once during that time. He was the last active goaltender to have played in the NHL in the 1990s.\nInternationally, Luongo has competed for Team Canada in numerous tournaments. As a junior, he won a silver medal at the 1999 World Junior Championships, while being named Best Goaltender in his second tournament appearance. Luongo won two gold medals at the 2003 and 2004 World Championships and a silver in the 2005 World Championships. He also won the 2004 World Cup championship and appeared in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin as a backup to Martin Brodeur in both instances. He succeeded Brodeur as Canada's starting goaltender during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, winning a gold medal. On January 7, 2014, he was named to the 2014 Canadian Olympic hockey team, where he won his second Olympic gold medal in a largely backup role to Carey Price.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Despite his height, he was also extremely agile. A dead-ball specialist, Rivaldo was renowned for his bending free kicks and penalty taking, as well as his ability to score from distance with powerful strikes. Left footed and possessing excellent technique, he was also known for his ball striking from volleys, and for having a penchant for scoring from bicycle kicks.\nApart from a right foot, Rivaldo had everything. His wiry strength allowed him to bounce off defenders, he was an outstanding dribbler, and he had a left foot that was both educated and thuggish, subtle and a sledgehammer. Brazil's bandy-legged genius was the most unstoppable footballer since Maradona.\nAlthough he was not a true striker, Rivaldo was a prolific goalscorer, capable of playing in several creative and offensive positions: during the prime of his career, a period where he won the Ballon d'Or and was named FIFA World Player of the Year, he was often deployed in a playmaking attacking midfield role as a classic number 10, due to his vision and passing ability, which made him an excellent assist provider. He could also function as a second striker, or as a left winger, a position which he often occupied earlier in his career, due to his acceleration and crossing ability. Although predominantly left footed, he was capable of playing on either wing.In 2002, John Carlin of The Guardian noted that Rivaldo \"combines to dazzling effect the two essential qualities of the ideal footballer: artistry and efficiency.\" His colleague, Rob Smyth, echoed his views in 2008, commenting: \"if you could marry British will with continental skill, you would have the perfect footballer. Such a mixed recipe was thrillingly in evidence in Diego Maradona. Since then, however, perhaps only Rivaldo has fused the two qualities,\" noting that like the Argentinian, the Brazilian had \"bronca\" (the word used repeatedly in Maradona's autobiography to refer to \"anger, fury, hatred, resentment, bitter discontent).

His first professional team was the Calgary Stampeders of the CFL, where he played from 1974 to 1976.\nHe began his NFL career with the New York Giants and is best remembered for his role in the November 19, 1978, game where the Giants, ahead 17\u201312 with only seconds to play and their opponent out of time-outs, lost after his handoff (a play called by offensive coordinator Bob Gibson over Pisarcik's objections) to Larry Csonka was fumbled and returned for a touchdown by Herman Edwards of the Philadelphia Eagles. The play has since been referred to as \"The Fumble\" by Giants fans and \"The Miracle at the Meadowlands\" by Eagles fans, and it was instrumental in making the Quarterback kneel (also known as \"taking a knee\") a routine play for running down the clock at the end of a game.\nPisarcik was traded to the Eagles in 1980 for a sixth round pick, primarily serving as the backup to QB Ron Jaworski. He stayed with the Eagles until retiring after the 1984 season.\nA resident of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Pisarcik has five children:  Kristin, Lindsey, Jake, Joseph and Katie. Jake is an offensive lineman for the University of Oregon.\nPisarcik served as the CEO of the NFL Alumni Association in Newark. He retired in April 2017.

{"id": "413_796", "question": "What position does Juan Cuadrado play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "413_9732", "text": "Cuadrado is known for his direct, offensive style of play along the right flank, and is capable of both scoring goals himself, courtesy of his striking ability from distance, as well as creating goalscoring opportunities for his teammates. He is capable of playing both as a wide midfielder, or as a winger in an attacking trident, due to his ability to make attacking runs down the wing. He often utilises his speed, flair, and technical skills to beat opponents in one on one situations and create space and time for him to shoot on goal, or deliver crosses to strikers in the area. Due to his playing style, which frequently involves taking on full-backs on the flank, and subsequently running towards the touch-line to deliver balls into the area, he has been labelled one of the few \"traditional\" wide midfielders in the current game.Tim Vickery, a reporter on South American football, stated that as Colombia's defensive players played near the goal in order to cover for veteran centre-back Mario Yepes, Cuadrado's pace, agility, creativity and dribbling ability on the right wing moved the team forward at the 2014 World Cup. Vickery also added that, in addition to his main role on the wing, Cuadrado is also adept as an attacking right back or wing back, due to his energy and work rate, as well as his other aforementioned qualities; he has also been used in this position more recently at Juventus, under managers Massimiliano Allegri, Maurizio Sarri, and Andrea Pirlo. A versatile player, he is also capable of playing on the left, a position which allows him to cut into the middle and shoot on goal with his stronger, right foot. In his early career, he was initially deployed as central or defensive midfielder, and was even deployed as an outright forward or striker; he is also capable of playing as an attacking midfielder, or as a second striker on occasion, and has even been used as a more offensive-minded central midfielder at times, known as the mezz'ala role, in Italian (which literally translates to \"half-winger\").Despite his talent and ability, Cuadrado's decision-making and reading of the game have been criticised at times in the media; moreover, he has also drawn criticism at times from some in the sport for being inconsistent, and for having an overly individualistic playing style. In 2017, Mina Rzouki of ESPN FC noted that \"Cuadrado has yet to learn the art of making decisive runs on a consistent basis. Still naive and capable of slowing down a game despite his pace, he does not boast the football intelligence of a world-beater.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}
