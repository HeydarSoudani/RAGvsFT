They called the area \"T\u00e1ptat\" (alternatively spelled Tap-tat, Top tut, etc.), which translates to \"long hair in front, short hair on the sides\", referring to a style of headdress.Colonel William Farrand Prosser first surveyed the area in 1879, then claimed homestead in 1882.  The Northern Pacific Railroad laid tracks through the area two years later.  A town plat was filed by Colonel Prosser in 1885, and in 1886 he was elected Yakima County Auditor.  He moved to North Yakima to attend to these duties, and never returned to the town that he founded.\nLewis Hinzerling built a flour mill at Prosser falls in 1887, encouraging further settlement of the area.  The first irrigation canal was completed in 1893 by the Prosser Falls Land and Irrigation Company.  Prosser was officially incorporated in 1899 with a population of 229 people.\nIn 1905, Benton County was carved out of the eastern portions of Yakima and Klickitat Counties. The new town of Prosser was chosen as county seat. In 1907 a power plant was added and began delivering electricity to the town.  The following year, a new high school was built, followed a year later by a telephone exchange.  In 1910 the city received a grant from Andrew Carnegie for a public library.\nThroughout the 1910s and 1920s various companies drilled in this area for oil and natural gas. There were no large findings and the Great Depression put an end to exploration.\nOn November 5, 1912, Benton County voters held a referendum to move the county seat from Prosser to either Kennewick or Benton City.  Intense rivalry and war of words between Benton City, Kennewick, and Prosser preceded the vote. Despite getting a majority of the vote, Kennewick did not receive 60 percent of the vote as required by law.  To date, Prosser remains the county seat.\nIn 1919, Washington State College (later WSU) established the Irrigation Experiment Station at Prosser.  The program's mandate is to study the problems faced by farmers, orchardists, and ranchers in the dry central part of the state. The station originally employed scientists from the college in Pullman, who partnered with scientists from the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The station is still currently in use, and offers a number of agricultural education programs.\nProsser at one point had three newspapers, which were consolidated in the 1920s into the Prosser Record-Bulletin, and a permanent courthouse was built in 1926.  The Benton County Historical Museum was dedicated in 1968.In more recent years, Prosser's location on a major river (the Yakima) and highway access has encouraged a growing wine business and associated tourist industry.

It is possible that Whitton was a landing stage on the south bank for the Roman fort and civitas of Petuaria Parisorum at Brough across the river. Roman Coins of Claudius Gothicus (268\u2013270 AD) and Constantine I (the Great) (309\u2013337 AD) have been found in the fields.Pevsner states that the Church tower \"re-uses massive blocks of Roman stone\", but these  blocks of millstone grit which are to be found in several local churches (such as neighbouring Winteringham) may have been transported down the Ouse and the Humber from York where Roman buildings were being dismantled, or may even have come from some sort of triumphal arch or structure (perhaps like the Arch of Constantine), which might have stood at the end of Ermine Street.Whitton is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book as \"Witenai\". Before the Conquest lordship was held by Siward Barn, and after by Saswalo of Ettington, with Henry de Ferrers becoming Tenant-in-chief. Listed are 300 acres (1.2 km2) of meadow, land for eight ploughs, two plough teams belonging to the lord, five men's plough teams, ten villans (villagers) four bordars (smallholders) and ten freemen. The land was valued at seven pounds.\nThe church is not mentioned in the Domesday survey.  St. John the Baptist is a building of stone overlooking the Humber, consisting of a west tower, a small nave (22 feet (6.7 m) wide and 37 feet (11.3 m) long) with a chancel and a south vestry attached.  The partly Romanesque (or Norman) tower contains three, now untolled, bells; the third bell is said to have been brought from the village of Welton, across the river in Yorkshire. The base of the tower forms a porch and the large tower arch, leading into the nave, is thought to be Romanesque.  The font is also ancient and may be from the same period. The church seems to have been almost completely rebuilt in about 1797-8 when the elaborate crocketted pinnacles were removed from the top of the tower. A drawing, by Nattes, of 1794 shows a dilapidated structure with a south aisle and a south porch.\nThe church was reseated in 1865 at the expense of Lady Strickland, and between about 1892 and 1897 the nave, chancel and roof were entirely rebuilt from the designs of W. & C. A. Bassett-Smith, architects, of London. On the north side of the chancel are two stained-glass windows, erected in 1918 to the memory of Henry Spilman who was killed in the First World War.

On Wulfseck Mountain they built their castle, which they named Wulfeshagen, later Altena. This is one of the several legends of the establishment of the county of Altena and the building of the castle.\nAfter the acquisition of the parish land of Mark near the city of Hamm in 1198, the counts of Altena took Mark Castle as their primary residence and called themselves the Counts of the Mark. They continued to only occasionally inhabit Altena Castle and from 1392 onward it was only used as a residence for the county bailiff (Amtmann). Count Engelbert III of the Mark gave the small settlement at the base of the mountain the rights of liberty (such as self-governance). In 1455 the castle burned down and was only re-erected partially.\nIn Brandenburg-Prussian times the castle became a garrison and was sold to the town of Altena in 1771. In the following years an almshouse and a workhouse was established there. This existed until 1840. From 1766 to 1811 there existed a criminal court and prison in the castle. By 1834 the castle was greatly deteriorated and was to be reconstructed. Due to lack of funds, however, this was not carried out. The Johanniter Orde set up a hospital in the buildings.Due to the 300th anniversary of the membership of the County of Mark to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1909 plans for a reconstruction of the castle began. In 1914 this was completed, apart from the outer bailey and lower gatehouse. There was a controversial debate about the modes of reconstruction, where the preference of historic designs over the medieval and early modern architecture was criticised. In 1918 the last works were completed.\nIn 1914, Richard Schirrmann established the world's first youth hostel within the castle, which is still in use today (Jugendherberge Burg Altena). The original rooms are a museum today. The youth hostel continues to run at a location on the lower castle court yard, opened in 1934.Today the castle is symbol  of the town of Altena and a tourist attraction.

The site of the mission was specifically chosen due to its proximity to the large number of Salinan villages in the area. The interior of the mission church features murals executed under the direction of the famed artist Esteban Munr\u00e1s in the 1820s.\nThe mission's location between Mission San Luis Obispo and Mission San Antonio de Padua provided a stop on the trip that had previously taken two days. In 1803, the mission reported an Indian population of 908, while its lands grazed 809 cattle, 3,223 sheep, 342 horses and 29 mules. That year's harvest included about 2,186 fanegas of wheat and corn (A fanega was about 220 pounds or 100 kilograms). Most of the mission burned, while still being developed, in 1806.

Reed used the Mission as a family residence and a store. In 1848, Reed and his family were murdered, leaving the Mission vacant for a period of time. The Mission was a stopping place for miners coming from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and, consequently, was used as a saloon, dance hall, storeroom and living quarters.\nIn 1859, President James Buchanan returned the mission to the Catholic Church. In 1878, after 38 years without a resident priest, Padre Philip Farrelly became the first pastor of Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel since the secularization. In 1928, Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel and Mission San Antonio de Padua were both returned to the Franciscan Order, which led to their restorations and repairs.\nThe 2003 San Simeon earthquake caused severe damage to the sanctuary at Mission San Miguel.

It continues through Little Thurlow, Great Thurlow, Great Wratting, and Kedington before passing to the east of Haverhill, where the county boundary between Suffolk and Essex starts to follow its course. The villages of Wixoe, Stoke-by-Clare, Clare and Cavendish are all on the left bank of the river. The River Glem joins it on the left bank, before it passes to the west of Long Melford and then skirts the western and southern edges of Sudbury. It is crossed by the A131 road at Ballingdon Bridge, to the south-west of Sudbury, below which it is officially navigable. It continues through Bures and to the south of Nayland to reach the western edge of Stratford St Mary. Dedham is on the south bank and Flatford on the north bank. To the south of Brantham the river becomes tidal below Cattawade barrage, after which it opens out to become an estuary near Manningtree, and runs along the southern side of the Shotley Peninsula. The international port of Harwich is on the south bank, and it is joined by the River Orwell as it reaches the sea to the east of Harwich.The whole of the river valley above Manningtree is a designated National Landscape, formerly known as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The designated area is called Dedham Vale, and is named after the village of Dedham in Essex. It is an area of rural beauty on both sides of the river, covering around 35 square miles (90 km2) in total.The earliest known settlement on the river in Suffolk was at Great Bradley, where human occupation has been recorded for over 5,000 years. During the Anglo-Saxon era, the river became the boundary between the Kingdom of the East Saxons and the Kingdom of East Anglia. The Life of King Alfred records a naval battle taking place at the mouth of the river in 884, where Alfred the Great defeated a force of 13 Viking ships.The Stour valley has been portrayed as a working river by artists including John Constable, Thomas Gainsborough, Alfred Munnings, John Nash and Cedric Morris. Constable's connection with the area was especially important, evident in such works as The Stour Valley and Dedham Church c. 1815. John Nash, who was an official war artist, settled in the Stour valley and is buried at St Andrew's at Wormingford , one of its typically serene small settlements.The River Stour Trust, a waterway restoration group, was set up in 1968 to protect and enhance the right of the public to navigate the River Stour. The trust seeks to restore through navigation from Sudbury to the sea, following on the successful restoration of the locks at Stratford St Mary, Dedham, Flatford and Great Cornard, by reinstating the remaining locks. Meanwhile, the Trust encourages use of the river by small craft and organises annual events for all age groups and abilities on different parts of it. Boat trips and private charters, skippered by volunteer crews from the Trust, are available in Flatford and Sudbury between Easter and October. RSPB Stour Estuary is a nature reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). It is located on the south bank of the estuary, to the east of Wrabness. Just to the west is Wrabness Nature Reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest covering 69 acres (28 ha). It is run by the Essex Wildlife Trust and is also a designated Local Nature Reserve and a Local Wildlife Site.In July 2019 sections of the river ran dry because of low rainfall and debris blocking flows at Bures Mill. The Environment Agency pumped water from boreholes into the river in an attempt to restore water levels.The river from Cattawade barrage to Orwell Haven is tidal and used by large ships.

Barbodhians have set up many Waqfs or Religious Foundations to help poor, needy, disadvantaged and unfortunate members of society, particularly in Burma and Mauritius.\nThe largest population of Barbodhians outside India is in Bolton, Greater Manchester, where the community settled in the 1950s and 1960s.

These settlers built the Middle Spring Presbyterian Church, among the oldest houses of worship in central Pennsylvania, in 1738 near present-day Shippensburg, Pennsylvania.\nThe General Assembly (legislature) of the Pennsylvania colony on January 27, 1750, created Cumberland County from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, naming it for Cumberland, England. Its county seat is Carlisle.  The county also lies within the Cumberland Valley adjoining the Susquehanna River at its eastern border, stretching approximately 42 miles from the borough of Shippensburg on the west to the Susquehanna River in east Cumberland County.\nThe oldest towns in the county are Shippensburg and Carlisle, each with its unique history. Shippensburg is home to Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, one of 14 universities of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. Carlisle is also home to Dickinson College, established in 1773, and the Penn State Dickinson School of Law.\nThe United States Army War College is a United States Army school located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on the 500 acres (2.0 km2) campus of the historic Carlisle Barracks, a military post dating back to the 1770s. It caters to high-level military personnel and civilians and prepares them for strategic leadership responsibilities. It is the U. S. Army's most senior military educational institution.\nDuring the Gettysburg campaign of the American Civil War in the summer of 1863, Confederate troops marched through the Cumberland Valley, briefly occupying much of the county.\nIn the 20th century, the suburbs of Harrisburg, the state capital, expanded extensively into eastern Cumberland County. Carlisle also developed suburbs in adjoining townships.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Founded and opened in 1934, it holds collections from the mid-19th century that were  amassed substantially by major American art and sculpture collectors, including William Thompson Walters and his son Henry Walters. William Walters began collecting when he moved to Paris as a nominal Confederate loyalist at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, and Henry Walters refined the collection and made arrangements for the construction what ultimately was Walters Art Museum. \nAfter allowing the Baltimore public to occasionally view his father's and his growing added collections at his West Mount Vernon Place mansion during the late 1800s, Henry Walters arranged for an elaborate stone palazzo-styled structure to be built for this purpose in 1905\u20131909, located a block south of the Walters mansion on West Monument Street/Mount Vernon Place, on the northwest corner of North Charles Street at West Centre Street.\nThe mansion and gallery were also just south and west of the landmark Washington Monument in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, just north of the downtown business district and northeast of Cathedral Hill. Upon his 1931 death, Henry Walters bequeathed the entire collection of then more than 22,000 works, the original Charles Street Gallery building, and his adjacent townhouse/mansion just across the alley to the north on West Mount Vernon Place to the City of Baltimore, \"for the benefit of the public\". The collection includes masterworks of ancient Egypt, Greek sculpture and Roman sarcophagi, medieval ivories, illuminated manuscripts, Renaissance bronzes, Old Master European and 19th-century paintings, Chinese ceramics and bronzes, Art Deco jewelry, and ancient Near East, Mesopotamian, or ancient Middle East items. Dorothy Miner became its first Keeper of Manuscripts in 1934 and held the post until her death in 1973.\nIn 2000, \"The Walters Art Gallery\" changed its long-time name to \"The Walters Art Museum\" to reflect its image as a large public institution and eliminate confusion among some of the increasing out-of-state visitors. The following year, \"The Walters\" (as it is often known locally) reopened its original main building after a dramatic three-year physical renovation and replacement of internal utilities and infrastructure. The Archimedes Palimpsest was on loan to the Walters Art Museum from a private collector for conservation and spectral imaging studies.\nStarting on October 1, 2006, the museum was enabled to make admission free to all, year-round, as a result of substantial grants given by Baltimore City and the surrounding suburban Baltimore County arts agencies and authorities.  In 2012, \"The Walters\" released nearly 20,000 of its own images of its collections on a Creative Commons license, and collaborated in  their upload to the world-wide web and the Internet on Wikimedia Commons.

This yielded an older Nassau-Idstein line from 1480 to 1509, later merging once again with Nassau-Wiesbaden and Nassau-Weilburg and, from 1629 to 1721, a newer Nassau-Idstein line.\n\nIn the 17th century, Count Johann of Nassau-Idstein persecuted witches in Idstein.In 1721, Idstein passed to Nassau-Ottweiler, and in 1728 to Nassau-Usingen, thereby losing its status as a residence town, although it became the seat of the Nassau Archives and of an Oberamt.\nNassau-Usingen was united with Nassau-Weilburg in 1806 into the Duchy of Nassau, becoming a member of the Confederation of the Rhine. After the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, Prussia annexed the Duchy as the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau.\nThe residential palace from the 17th century is used by the Pestalozzischule as a school building. It was expanded with a new building below the palace.\nFrom the late 18th century to the mid 20th, Idstein was the centre of an important leather industry. During the Second World War, many women became forced labour for work in the tanneries. In 1959, the dominant tannery in the middle of the town core was shut down for economic reasons. The lands right at the edge of the Old Town lay empty and were used until the 1980s as a carpark. Today, new shops and apartments surround the L\u00f6herplatz, which is now a marketplace.\n\nThe private Kalmenhof clinic in Idstein was drawn into the Nazi Euthanasia programme. Under Action T4, the Kalmenhof served as a way station for Hadamar killing centre. After the gassings at Hadamar came to an end in the face of public protests, especially from the churches, the Kalmenhof itself, in the course of Aktion Brandt, became a killing institute; patients here were murdered with poison injections.Shortly after the war, reports of young wards being mishandled came to light.Eleven formerly independent villages were merged as of 1971 into Idstein, under the framework of municipal reform.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A market is attested in 1119. The town was located on the important trade route, the Via Regia Lusatiae inferioris, between Leipzig and Frankfurt an der Oder that crossed the river Elbe at a ford east of Torgau.\nTorgau belonged to the duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg, which in 1356 was raised to be the Electorate of Saxony. After the last Ascanian duke died without issue in 1423, the Electorate passed to the Wettin dynasty, which took up its residence at Torgau.\nFollowing the Treaty of Leipzig partition of the Wettin inheritance on 26 August 1485, Torgau fell to the Ernestine line. Frederick III, Elector of Saxony and his successors had Hartenfels Castle at Torgau built by architect Conrad Pfl\u00fcger and his successor Konrad Krebs.\nThe Ernestine court resided mainly in Torgau and in Weimar. From 1525 onward, Torgau became the sole residence. Hartenfels Castle is the largest completely preserved castle of the early Renaissance in Germany. After the Battle of M\u00fchlberg in 1547, Torgau fell to the Albertine line.\nDuring the Reformation, the town council closed all cloisters in 1523. Citizens of Torgau destroyed paintings and statues of saints in the churches and stormed the Franciscan monastery.\nAfter Martin Luther had driven Andreas Karlstadt from Saxony in 1524, he enforced the expulsion of Karlstadt's followers from Torgau in 1529. Katharina von Bora, the widow of Luther, died in Torgau and is buried there in the Marienkirche. The court chapel, constructed in 1543-44 by Nikolaus Gromann, was consecrated by Luther on 5 October 1544; it is thus the second oldest newly constructed Protestant church in the world, after the court chapel of Neuburg Castle which was consecrated in 1543.\nThe Torgauer Artikel, a draft of the Augsburg Confession, was composed by Luther, Melanchthon, Bugenhagen and Jonas in the electoral superindenture in 1530 (Wintergr\u00fcn).

{"id": "131_462", "question": "Where is Beach City located?", "ctxs": [{"id": "131_73454", "text": "With the boom economy after World War II, people had time and money for recreation. People from Baytown especially began to take advantage of the drawbridge and built small summer/weekend houses or \"fishing camps\" along the shoreline of the present Beach City. By the early 1950s, they had nicknamed FM-2354 \"Tri-City Beach Road\", because the present Baytown resulted from a merger of three smaller towns in 1948.\nHowever, a number who came for recreation decided to stay. By the early 1960s the community commonly called Tri-City Beach had about 500 permanent residents. At that time, the Texas legislature began to consider annexation reform. Previously, Texas municipalities had almost unfettered power to annex adjacent lands. Cities could control vast territories by annexing ten-feet-wide strips surrounding them. During that period, Baytown controlled an area larger than the California city of Los Angeles did. Larger cities could even annex smaller cities, after they had annexed to surround them. Knowing that reform was pending, many cities began a flurry of annexations. Defensively, a number of unincorporated communities began proceedings to incorporate as municipalities. The Tri-City Beach community was one of those.\nOn April 6, 1963, the Tri-City Beach Civic Association was formed. They met to discuss ways to better their community. The officers were Hayden Harper, a local grocer, President; Nina Harper, Secretary; Georgia Mackrell, Chairman of Publicity; and John Jennings, Chairman of the Membership Committee. The association explored a number of ideas, including the construction of a breakwater, and then began considering incorporation as a city. An Incorporation Committee was formed consisting of George Armer, Ruth Hoover, Eloice Jordan, J.D. Nicholson, and Bill White. Ms. Jordan met with County Judge Oscar F. Nelson, Jr. on March 8, 1966, and presented him with a petition for an incorporation election. On March 24, 1966, the Baytown City Council adopted Ordinance 788, consenting to the inclusion of an unspecified part of what Baytown then claimed as its extraterritorial jurisdiction within the proposed new municipality to be known as the City of Beach City. On April 5, 1966, an election was held to determine if the area would become a municipality. The results were 103 for incorporation to 4 opposed. The incorporation of Beach City was finalized by a decree issued by Judge Nelson on April 11, 1966.\nTo prevent annexation by the nearby city of Baytown, this community voted in April 1966 to become incorporated. An election was held on May 21, 1966, to select the first municipal officers. Eloice Jordan was elected mayor.  W.D. Bush, Alvin J. Crawley, William D. Daniel, J.R. Holland, and J.D. Nicholson were chosen as aldermen for the first city council. Gus Dauzat became the first city marshal. Later Ruth Hoover was appointed by the Council as city secretary and Claude Galloway as deputy marshal.\nThe mayors of the city have been (by date of election):\n\nEloice Jordan \u2013 April 6, 1968\nJimmy McClellan \u2013 April 7, 1970\nHerschel Scott \u2013 April 27, 1976\nJim Ainsworth \u2013 May, 1982\nA.R.  \"Rusty\" Senac \u2013 April, 1986\nJames Standridge \u2013 May 26, 1992\nA.R. \"Rusty\" Senac \u2013 May 23, 2000\nGuido Persiani \u2013 May 25, 2004\nBilly Combs \u2013 May 8, 2010The Beach City Volunteer Fire Department was formed in 1967 and still exists. A Tri-City Beach Emergency Medical service organization had been formed before the city's incorporation and has since been merged into a county-wide emergency medical service.\nWith Baytown's concurrence, Beach City increased its area on August 19, 1968, by annexing approximately 1,781 acres (721 ha) near Point Barrow Road and taking in McCollum Park. The 1968 annexation moved the northern boundary of the city to Lawrence Road. This annexation brought into the city limits the historic home site of early pioneer Solomon Barrow (1801\u20131858), whose land included the area where McCollum Park is now located. The park, as a matter of record, contains the last resting place of Barrow, his wife Elizabeth Winfree, and Barton Clark, the first husband of their daughter Narcissa Ophelia Henrietta Jane Barrow. On October 27, 1970, again with Baytown's concurrence, Beach City annexed the area where the Beach City Community Building and the Beach City VFD fire station are located. That is the only part of the city limits that extends west of FM-2354.\nMeanwhile, there were rumors that Baytown intended to annex the community of Cove. On September 22, 1970, Beach City received a petition of 84 residents of Cove to annex the community. The mayor of Beach City at the time was Jimmy McClellan. On November 24, 1970, Beach City annexed Cove, an area bounded generally on the west by FM-2354, on the east by the Old and Lost Rivers, on the south by Lawrence Road, and on the north by a line just north of FM-565. On December 2, 1970, Beach City extended its Cove annexation to include the property where the old Cove Community Building sits. This time Baytown did not concur. In 1971, Baytown sued Beach City in an attempt to stop the annexation of Cove. In 1973, Beach City released its claim to what are now the city limits of Cove. An incorporation election was held and the City of Cove was incorporated on May 23, 1973. Leroy Stevens was Cove's first mayor. The City Council of Beach City presented to Mayor Stevens Cove's first municipal seal, which is believed to be the one still in use.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The view into the distance from the Wartgesberg (mountain) as far as the Altburg and the heights of the Hunsr\u00fcck was used by the Romans, who built watchtowers on its heights.\nEmperor Heinrich VI, who was the great Emperor Barbarossa's son, transferred lordship over Struhna and the estate of Drucksbersch (Trautzberg) to Springiersbach Abbey. This monastery maintained a monasterial estate here with huge forest and land areas. The estate buildings stood in what is today's outlying centre of Sprink. Even today, Springiersbach's coat of arms can be found preserved on a house in Sprink.\nAmong the places named in a confirmation document issued by Heinrich VI to Abbot Absalon von Springiersbach are cropfields and meadows at Struhna. In 1297, Count Heinrich of Luxembourg enfeoffed the knight Richard, Lord of Daun, with the tithes from Stroin. In 1299, the fief was expanded to include the whole village, which hitherto had only been an allodial holding.\nA newly built house \u2013 a fortified one \u2013 was owned in 1336 by Aegidius, Lord of Daun, who, because of this house, had to assume obligations to the Archbishop. In later centuries, the monastery's estate was forsaken. The lands and woods were sold off, and bought up by the villagers. The estate buildings in Sprink were acquired by three families. Even today, there are agricultural businesses being run there.\nIn the Middle Ages, Strohn was also the site of a high court.\nIn the 19th century, Strohn found itself under the lordship of the Count of Daun and thereby belonged to the County of Daun. A great fire struck the village in 1760, and it burnt down utterly. Only one house was left, the Justenhaus owned by the family Schmitz. Even the church's nave burnt down; only the tower remained standing. From inside, the old Marien Glocke (bell) still sounds. It bears the year 1483 and this inscription, in archaic German: Maria hei\u00dfen ich, alle Weder verdriffen ich Claus von Enen gos mich (\"Maria is my name, all weather I drive away, Claus von Enen poured me\").\nDuring the time of French rule, Strohn was the seat of a mairie (\"mayoralty\") in the Canton of Manderscheid and the Arrondissement of Pr\u00fcm, and even into Prussian times, this was still a B\u00fcrgermeisterei (also \"mayoralty\"). On 22 August 1841, with ministerial permission, the B\u00fcrgermeisterei of Strohn was amalgamated with that of Gillenfeld. The B\u00fcrgermeisterei of Strohn included until 1841 Brockscheid, Immerath, mit dem Heckenhofe, M\u00fcckeln mit Schutzalf, Niederwinkel, Oberwinkel, Sprink, Trautzberg and Strotzb\u00fcsch.

The name \"Callowhill\" was coined by the Callowhill Neighborhood Association, a community organization in the area; although this name often appears on online maps, the City of Philadelphia does not have an official name for this area. Callowhill is named for Callowhill Street, which was named after Hannah Callowhill Penn, William Penn's second wife and de facto proprietor of Pennsylvania after William Penn.  \nCallowhill was formerly home to large-scale manufacturing and other industries, of which an architectural history has been left in the form of grand old abandoned factories. During the 1970s and 1980s, the population of Callowhill plummeted, and although numbers are rising, it is a fairly unpopulated section of the city compared to surrounding neighborhoods. Recently developers have started to employ adaptive reuse projects, converting them into loft style housing; so much so that many have termed the neighborhood \"The Loft District\". In 2010 the Callowhill Industrial Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places.Callowhill is physically cut off from its neighbor to the south, Chinatown, by the Vine Street Expressway. This has largely prevented Chinese businesses from spreading north, although some industrial and storage uses by the Chinese community have been placed in Callowhill. Vine Street is also blamed for the abrupt drop in pedestrian life above Chinatown, and the struggle faced by efforts to redevelop this section of the city that lies between Center City and North Philadelphia.\nThe former Reading Railroad train trestle, the Reading Viaduct, is a defining feature of the Callowhill neighborhood. Neighborhood groups proposed that the abandoned structure be maintained as a public park. The Reading Viaduct park plan gained momentum in 2009 when Philadelphia's Center City District (CCD), and its influential president Paul Levy, became enamored of the idea and ultimately became a partner to help manage the project. CCD announced on Tuesday, February 6, 2018 that the first phase of the quarter-mile-long, elevated park would open in spring 2018.

Another version is it is a corruption of the original name for the area's rocky shoreline, Gal Bokka, Gal being the Sinhalese for rock and that Gal Gate actually meant rock gate.\nIn 1856 the then Governor of British Ceylon, Sir Henry George Ward (1797\u20131860) authorised the construction of a 1 mile (1.6 km) promenade along the oceanside of the Galle Face Green, for ladies and children to saunter and \u2018take in the air\u2019.

The western terminus is west of York, and the eastern terminus is east of Lancaster. At both ends, PA 462 terminates at U.S. Route 30 (US 30), which follows a mostly freeway alignment parallel to the north between York and Lancaster. The route heads east into York, where it follows the one-way pair of Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound. In York, PA 462 runs concurrent with PA 74 and crosses Interstate 83 Business (I-83 Bus.). East of York, the route becomes a multilane road that has an interchange with I-83 and crosses PA 24. PA 462 continues east through Hallam to Wrightsville and passes through that town before it crosses the Susquehanna River and runs through Columbia. East of here, the route continues through Mountville before reaching the city of Lancaster. In Lancaster, PA 462 is routed on the one-way pair of King Street eastbound and Walnut Street westbound, with the westbound direction concurrent with PA 23. The route crosses US 222/PA 272 and northbound PA 72 in Lancaster. East of Lancaster, PA 462 becomes a multilane road again and continues to its eastern terminus.\nThe section of the current route east of Lancaster was built as a turnpike called the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in 1794, which headed east to Philadelphia. By 1796, a road continued west from Lancaster across the Susquehanna River to York. The state took over the turnpike in the beginning of the 20th century. In 1913, the road between York and Lancaster was incorporated into the Lincoln Highway, an auto trail that ran from San Francisco east to New York City. The Lincoln Highway through Pennsylvania became PA 1 in 1924. US 30 was designated concurrent with PA 1 west of Philadelphia in 1926, with the PA 1 designation removed two years later. US 30 was widened into a multilane road between York and Lancaster in the 1930s. The route was moved to one-way pairs in Lancaster in the 1930s, following King Street eastbound and Orange Street westbound, and York in the 1950s, following Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound. In 1967, US 30 was moved to a freeway bypass between Prospect Road east of Columbia and east of Lancaster, with the former alignment becoming PA 462. US 30 was realigned to a freeway between York and Columbia in 1972 and PA 462 was extended west along the former alignment to west of York.

Wilson reorganized the school's objective after finding a low success rate regarding people whose lifestyles changed permanently. During the 1990s, Wilson worked to make Life School a free tuition school. This was in response to the gang activities in the Dallas area that made the city the murder capital (per capita) of the United States. Wilson's goal was to teach and train children before they became involved in gang activities.Life School filed a charter school application with the Texas Education Agency in 1997. The application was completed by Wilson along with other community leaders that included educational lawyers and other educators. In March 1998 the school was granted the charter and began open enrollment as a free tuition public school in August that same year. The school became popular in the communities it served and parents camped out overnight to enroll their children. The first Life School campus to open was in Oak Cliff, Texas in Dallas County.Life School became the first charter school in Texas to access Permanent School Funding.

With his wife he established an inn, the Sawyers Arms, in 1839 three years after the colony of South Australia was created. He then built the Norfolk Arms on 16 acres (6 ha) in 1840 with banquet seating for 150. He moved to Adelaide and sold the Norfolk Arms in 1842, at which point it was known as The Crafers Inn. A new hotel was built on the site in 1880, remaining into the 21st century as The Crafers Inn, but the original building was burned down in 1926. At the time the area at the foot of nearby Mount Lofty was known as the Tiers, infamous for being the haunt of numerous Tiersmen and woodcutters on the run from authorities in Adelaide.The historic Crafers Primary School was first established in the area in 1865 by Mr Edward Smith. The school was initially located in small premises in Atkinson Road, and then moved to its present location in Piccadilly Road in 1928. The historic stone and brick building was opened on 31 August of that year. The late 1970s saw extensive upgrading of the school facilities under Principal Allan Stanley-Smith, including construction of the Ruth Beare Hall in 1976 named after Ruth Beare who taught at the school from 1937 to 1944 and 1947 to 1975.The Church of the Epiphany, Epiphany Place, Crafers has played a prominent role in the life of the district since it was built in 1878 on land donated by Henry Scott.\nFor many years Crafers was well known for being the start point of the South Eastern Freeway linking Adelaide with the town of Murray Bridge, and to the Princes Highway leading to Melbourne. It wasn't until 2000 that the Heysen Tunnels project was completed to extend the freeway to Glen Osmond on the outskirts of Adelaide. Prior to the tunnel opening, the winding road from Adelaide to Glen Osmond via Eagle On The Hill was frequently the scene of horrific vehicle accidents, often involving semi-trailers.The Mount Lofty Botanic Garden is nestled in the hills behind Crafers. The gardens, opened in 1977, include an extensive mix of European and Australian native plants and are at their finest in the spring months.On 16 February 1983, Crafers was hard hit by the Ash Wednesday bushfires. Many homes adjacent to bushland on the western side of the suburb were destroyed (as well as the Anglican theological college and priory of St Michael's House) as the fire came roaring out of the then Cleland National Park, and the devastation would have been much worse if a change in weather had not occurred right when the township of Crafers itself was being threatened. A memorial on Mount Lofty Summit is dedicated to those in the Adelaide Hills who lost their lives that day.Crafers is under the administration of the Adelaide Hills Council, and is in the state electoral district of Bragg and the federal electorate of Mayo.
