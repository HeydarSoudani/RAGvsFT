Therefore, Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 may appear as an \u201corganic intellectual\u201d, in the sense of visually codifying and making more coherent, presenting and making more broadly present in the public, a specific shared non-hegemonic and, both culturally and socially, underrepresented world-view \u201cin a way that is directive and organizational, i.e. educative, i.e. intellectual\u201d,  but he does not do that as someone who enters the field of art from the outside. He does that as an artist fully belonging to it, and being formed by it, and within it. Thereby, he acts in a synthetic manner, as a link between the life worlds where minor cultures are developed, and the elitist art world, as defined in its hegemonic role. Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 even made that clear himself in a discussion with the local art critic and art journalist Danijela Pure\u0161evi\u0107, by stating the following: \u201cI use figuration the way Duchamp used ready-made. I use figuration dually. And I am not a figurative painter. I am a pure conceptualist\u201d.\nUro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 is not a punk who paints. He performs conceptual manoeuvres by using a specific \u201cpainterly style\u201d (or \u201cstyle of representation\u201d in his later works that are not paintings) treated as a ready-made. That enables him to resample different historical styles without actually paying tribute either to the artists who originally used them or to the actual times and contexts of use. He uses the surface of the painting, drawing, photography or a digital collage as a screen for projecting, not his own empirically and psychologically framed visions and desires, but those specific social issues that go far beyond what is screened in the public media or conventionally shown in major art shows. By using his own image in paintings, photographs, and digital collages, he produces an art of signs, an art of discourse, questioning the effects of visual images on the usual perception of identity, history and culture, and testing the implications of the use of these images for the art system and the models of perception of artworks as such. The subjectivity he demonstrates is not simply taken for granted but is already \u201cdeconstructed, taken apart, and shifted, without anchorage\u201d.  It is rooted in language and effective in the realm of the symbolic. In his work, he places his self-representations at quite a distance from the psycho-biographic realm, which would be just visualized. As Roland Barthes stated, the life of the author cannot be considered as \u201cthe origin of his fables, but a fable that runs concurrently with his work.\u201d\nAutonomism and Populism\n\nIn 1994, Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 wrote, together with Stevan Marku\u0161, a manifesto entitled \u201cThe Autonomism Manifesto\u201d. It was written in February and March 1994, and published as a leaflet, to be later included in the catalogue of their joint exhibition, held in Pan\u010devo in June 1995. \u201cIt was created to reduce to a minimum the possibility of shallow stories about our painting\u201d, stated their text of the Manifesto, referring to the history of its own making. Going back to the experiences of the local historical avant-gardes, namely, Zenitism, whose manifesto these artists not only quoted in their own manifesto but even claimed to repeat, they looked for a way to avoid being listed among the \u201curban section\u201d of \u201cfigurative painters\u201d, following the \u201cother line\u201d of former Yugoslav art, who institutionalized those practices within the histories of neo-avant-gardes, of neo-constructivists, conceptual and process art movements, considered to be tendencies of \u201cradical\u201d,  as opposed to \u201csoft\u201d modernism. They also did not feel quite comfortable with the concept of \u201cmonumental intimism\u201d,  which placed them amongst the authors active in the \u201cinterspace between high art and the underground\u201d,  with \u0110ile Markovi\u0107 and Zoran Marinkovi\u0107, in the close proximity of authors such as Daniel Glid and Jasmina Kali\u0107. Their use of images was more denaturalized than those of the artists who were reputedly stylistically close to them. Their relationship with the \u201cunderground\u201d, on the other hand, was on the level of repetition of visual samples that were part of the imagery of empowerment, but in a context that was not the context of subcultures \u2013 they played with different rhetorical operations within the language of art, but materialized mainly as paintings of conventional format, and executed in conventional techniques, like oil on canvas. \u201cWe are classics\u201d, they stated, in an ironic manner, while they were still students, and they said that in order to oppose classifications.  They wanted histories of their own, ones that escape the constraints of theory-led production, art-historian-dominated interpretation, and exhibiting within the framework imposed by curators. They wanted to create the context in which their work is produced, viewed and exhibited. That was Autonomism.\nIn the late nineties, Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 started exhibiting mainly without Stevan Marku\u0161. He switched his preferred techniques from oil painting and charcoal drawing to electronic collages, photographs, performances and whatever else might come as the most appropriate medium for the realization of some concrete project. What he kept was a passionate attachments to self-portraits, so that his own image still played the \u201ctheoretical object\u201d in most of the works, only the process and the final result were much more open with respect to the manner of realization that before. His major project for the end of the nineties, and the project through which he developed another referential frame for his works, was entitled The Populist Project. As the author stated himself, the main objective of the project was to show the interaction between the star system and identity. Its components were titled God Loves the Dreams of Serbian Artists, Celebrities, Hometown Boys and Pioneers. The images of the author featured in different segments of the project, presenting him as part of the most prominent football teams in Europe, in the company of various public personalities, on the cover of an imaginary magazine entitled \u201cHometown Boys\u201d, and among the most prominent authors in the field of art production and interpretation from what was once geopolitically labelled as Eastern Europe, all of whom were shown as proudly wearing a red pioneer scarf, in a glorious posture taken from the iconography of socialist realism. With this project, he went against the stereotypical social and political, not so much art-historical framing of his works. While most left-wing scholars in Serbia dealt with the issue of populism as determined to serve the right wing ideology, he demonstrated that populism had no pre-articulated social implication, and that in order to enter the struggle in the public arena, one has to be able to articulate it. His manner of articulation was rooted in the antagonistic potential of all the popular interpellations, connecting his populist project with the heritage of populist anarchism, which reappeared locally on the grass roots level whenever the local population was to be turned into members of a nation, party, etc. Instead of producing representations of all the invisible parts of the society within the field of art, which is the prevailing paradigm of socially specific works, he went directly into the populist media to work on antagonizing the attitudes towards the public images of celebrities, including his own, using those media the way he used canvas.\nIntegral version of the text was published in: Umelec international 3/2006", "hasanswer": false}]}

The project has been presented in its different stages during the last performances as well, while detailed information has been given by the artist on the occasion of the 'Arci Award'.Between 2006 and 2012, she presented her work and research at many prestigious festival like Arezzo Wave, Electronika Festival Aterforum Festival \u2013 during the meeting with Meredith Monk, 5 Giornate per la Nuova Musica Festival \u2013 with which she has been collaborating since 2008, Salone Internazionale del Libro; London Hoxton Festival; Intermidia Festival \u2013 Slovakia; gaining attention from the international press as well.In the middle of 2013, she founded the band with which mainly pays homage to the greatest women of rhythm and blues, \"to bring back and bring up that unique and originary strength, passion and pain, today forgotten especially in Europe; that is one thing with my deeper work\". \nThe band has been performing since May 2013 all over the Milan area.As she said, \"the Blues is at the center as feeling and intention in a variety of styles that will allow us to cross \u2013 within the limits of our ability \u2013 the twentieth century, from Swing to Fusion\". (Romina Daniele on One TV)Between electronics and vocal experimentation, live studio session in solo and with the band, extended vocalism and blues, her latest record is a triple cd titled Spannung produced between 2009 and 2015, and released on December the 24th 2015. The book Voce Sola \u2013 essay on the vocal discourse to be released in 2016 \u2013 has been written during the same years.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_34218", "text": "Daniele was born and grown in Naples, where she studied classic dance and classic guitar, and started to write poems, tales, songs, to paint and to photograph since she was a child. In the Nineties she participated to exhibitions and was noted and mentioned by local and national magazines. The poems written between 1995 and 2005 are today part of the collected poems book Poesie 1995\u20132005, English and Italian bilingual edition (RDM, 2010).After the studies on Art criticism, aesthetics and Cinema at the University of Naples Suor Orsola Benincasa, and that in vocals with Auli Kokko (singer for Daniele Sepe's band), Daniele focuses herself in musical activity moving to Milan in 2005, where \"the climate for experimental singing is more receptive\", and where she received the Stratos Prize and has gone through different professional experiences as well.\nDuring the academic year 2006\u20132007 she teaches the results of her vocal research included in the record Diffrazioni Sonore at \"Crams School of Music\" in Lecco (Italy), working for collective experimental laboratories, concerts, and individual lessons as well.\nDiffrazioni Sonore, released in 2005 and her first album project, \"consists entirely of multi-tracked, and entirely improvised vocal music, some of it treated digitally (radical EQ, echo, and a little reverb), but otherwise left well enough alone\", and is focused on the relationship between improvisation and construction.The second record Aisth\u00e0nomai, il Dramma della Coscienza, released in 2008, for voice and electronics, is focused on sound research in the fields of vocalism and electronic music, including compositions with texts in Italian, English and French. Consisting of textual philosophizing more abundantly, it can be read like a theoretical work, an organized anthology and a poetical-musical form.As Rick Moody writes, Daniele's approach seems to come more from the wilds of literature, and particularly from the wilds of European philosophy, than from any rigorous background in music. Both the two released records are, in fact, loaded with literature references, as a quick look at the booklets points out. They both include \"theoretical line texts\" which look like essays or manifestos; on one hand these essays explain the foundation of Daniele's musical activity, coming mostly from contemporary philosophy, in particular from the French philosophy by Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes and the theoretic-linguistic vision by Pier Paolo Pasolini; on the other hand, as Dionisio Capuano remarks, \"her theoretic will can hamper the total fruition\".In the interviews Daniele declares herself to be devoted to \"feeding doubt and a whirlpool of feelings, my primarily aim is structuring thought: a human one.\" Otherwise, music with new technologies is elected as research device, superior to every other one, in the study on the human being; in the same way, the voice is the most powerful mean of human expression, from an anthropological, physiological, and linguistic point of view, and just secondly a musical instrument.\nIn particular:\n\nDiffrazioni Sonore is a result of the research I have been conducting since 2000 in a number of areas: voice, composition by electronic means, philosophy applied to multimedia. Studying film history and theory, art criticism and aesthetic analysis, I approached the fields of thought that my research is based on, which include Gilles Deleuze\u2019s philosophy and Michel Chion\u2019s theory applied to film, a multimedia art form. I am referring specifically to the linguistic and morphological foundations of my work, by virtue of the relationship between, and coexistence among, different languages, including voice, poetry, writing, music, electronics, art, thought, man. (Romina Daniele on the Rumpus)\nIn an interview on the Rockerilla magazine, she also mentioned film-makers and painters as influences for her musical work: \"Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Marcel Proust, Friederich Nietzsche and Henri Bergson, Jusepe de Ribera and Francis Bacon, David Lynch and Michelangelo Antonioni.\"Between 2006 and 2008, during the work on her second record Daniele wrote the essay Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud, Il luogo della musica nell'audiovisione (RDM, 2011), in English: the site of music in Audio-Vision, title which reminds to two previous studies, one is the Site of Film by Christian Metz\n, the other is Audio-Vision by Michel Chion. As a matter of fact, the essay is the dissertation thesis with which Daniele degreed Cum Laude in Cinema Studies, supervised by professor Augusto Sainati from the Sorbonne of Paris, who has been studying the cinema combining the semiotic analysis and the historical and sociological points of view for a long time. Daniele's thesis is focused on the relationship between music and image in the cinema, conducted through the detailed analysis of the French movie Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud (1959) by Louis Malle, with soundtrack by Miles Davis. Furthermore, Daniele honours the Davis soundtrack covering the piece Nuit sur les Champs-\u00e9lys\u00e9es in the second record.At the end of 2008, she starts studying electronic music, as post graduate studies, at the Milan Conservatory, which led her to one of the finalists for the 'National Award of Arts' in 2010 and 2011.In the same year she also starts working in the field of silent movies screened with live improvisations by a collaboration with Riccardo Sinigaglia Electro-acoustic ensemble.Between the 2008 and 2011 she dedicated herself to literature production, publishing the books mentioned above and the essay Il dialogo con la materia disintegrata e ricomposta, un'analisi di Thema (Omaggio a Joyce) di Luciano Berio (RDM, 2010). It is an analysis of Thema (Omaggio a Joyce) by Luciano Berio, described as the first electro-acoustic composition in the history of western music made entirely with voice and elaboration of it by technological means. The voice was that of the great American avant-garde singer Cathy Berberian, reading from the Ulysses by James Joyce. Thus, this book is categorized as a biography, and also as an autobiography as can be found in Google Books. On the other hand, Daniele has been working on the essay Voce Sola (Solo Voice) for some years, a book describing her aesthetic and linguistic research in all fields of her activity, mostly focused on music and vocalism.Considering the contemporary western music and its twentieth-century history from the Musique concr\u00e8te to the experimental music, to the most recent experiences on technology applied to music, her work seems focused on a kind of electronic music as sound research or sound art.\nFrom the vocal point of view her work is focused on the transfiguration of the song form through the organic changing of the voice, vocals-electronics assimilation, the dramatic experimentation on the text-vocals, sound poetry and the total theatre-song:\nA peculiar combination of different disciplines including theatre, philosophy, aesthetics and electronics used as a movie soundtrack, can be seen as a real opera of avant-garde theatre. Romina Daniele put herself in front of the audience stimulating it and producing a thrilling and a charming sound with vocals creating dark/shining atmospheres throwing the listener in a lyrics-voice-music spiral that oblige us to confront with ourselves. (Alessio Arena on Drexkode)\nAlthough, as Moody remarks, Daniele's work \"is not only complex, only demanding, only methodical, but, actually, though it has its challenges, it is also playful, sweet, sometimes funny, and, on occasion, rooted in an appreciation of vernacular music like jazz, blues, and pop.\"In fact, speaking about her Blues live concerts, Romina Daniele said:\n\nI am doing the Blues today because I feel it like a shear, vertical push that starts from the inside, comes out from every pore and goes straight to the heart. And this is one thing at the base of my work, which very often has been positively welcomed in the contemporary avant-garde fields and similar, where sometime, it can happen, the fundamental things of life are lost which indeed are the strength and the instinctivity of the emotions. (Romina Daniele on Rock n Roll Radio) \nBetween 2009 and 2012 she studies New Technologies and Electronic Music at the Milan Conservatory. And so, as said before, she represented the Conservatorio di Milano at the final stage of \u2018Premio Nazionale delle Arti' (Arts National Award) 2010 and 2011 editions. She studied with Riccardo Sinigaglia, Alessandro Melchiorre, Giovanni Cospito; she has attended many workshops and seminars among which we can mention those of Meredith Monk, Trevor Wishart, David Moss and Annette Vande Gorne.\nRDM Records was born in 2010 through her collaboration, with the purpose of promoting research and the technical and aesthetic autonomy.The title of her latest record is Spannung, from German: tension, opening of the research. Particularly significant in this work is the cycle of the Dasein, divided in three parts and themes, which is the title of her 2010\u20132012 performances as well. Dasein, from German as well: being; in Martin Heidegger's philosophy: being the here, to be at stake of one's being into the being itself.As Romina Daniele said, both the record and the book Voce Sola \u2013 essay on the vocal discourse:\n\n indicates the opening, the space, the tension (and the yearning) of being in the size of the authenticity of existence, that is what we are and are looking for: to be at stake of one\u2019s being into the being itself with everything of us into the world before it goes away in vain.

The same year he was assigned the task of expanding the city, which involved designing housing estates, schools, swimming pools and parks and gardens. While his early style in Hilversum grew out of the Amsterdam School, the dramatic massing, asymmetry, the overhanging eaves and other elements of his landmark Hilversum City Hall were clearly influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright and the Chicago Prairie School. The City Hall is regarded as his masterpiece and manages to merge the requirements of being both a symbol of the city and an efficient administrative building. It is indicative of the garden-city character of Hilversum. Indeed, Dudok was clearly influenced by Ebenezer Howard and Raymond Unwin, pioneers of the garden-city movement in the United Kingdom. Dudok continued to produce progressive, Dutch modernist structures in Hilversum for decades, through the 1960s, and had international influence. Amongst school designers in the Netherlands, his schools in Hilversum became particularly celebrated.Dudok was also the architect of the branch of the De Bijenkorf department store in Rotterdam, a spectacular piece of commercial architecture clearly influenced by the Bauhaus, de Stijl, and the streamlining that was popular in both Art Deco and Art Moderne modernist design of the 1920s and 1930s. When it opened in 1930, some 70,000 people attended the event. While it was partly destroyed in the German bombing of Rotterdam in May 1940 during the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands, numerous photographs, plans and other material documenting the structure's design and the structure have survived and recently aided in the production of a Dutch documentary on Dudok's department store.Dudok received the RIBA Gold Medal in 1935 and the AIA Gold Medal in 1955. He also designed the Coll\u00e8ge n\u00e9erlandais in the Cit\u00e9 Universitaire in Paris, a cultural centre in Baghdad and a cinema in Calcutta. One of the buildings he designed in Rotterdam now houses a cafe-restaurant named after him. He drew up plans for the rebuilding of The Hague after WW2. This involved a new district for 150,000 people in the southwest of the city.

He was the country's first president and played a significant role in the transformation of Kenya from a colony of the British Empire into an independent republic. Ideologically an African nationalist and a conservative, he led the Kenya African National Union (KANU) party from 1961 until his death.\nKenyatta was born to Kikuyu farmers in Kiambu, British East Africa. Educated at a mission school, he worked in various jobs before becoming politically engaged through the Kikuyu Central Association. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu land affairs. During the 1930s, he studied at Moscow's Communist University of the Toilers of the East, University College London, and the London School of Economics. In 1938, he published an anthropological study of Kikuyu life before working as a farm labourer in Sussex during the Second World War. Influenced by his friend George Padmore, he embraced anti-colonialist and Pan-African ideas, co-organising the 1945 Pan-African Congress in Manchester. He returned to Kenya in 1946 and became a school principal. In 1947, he was elected President of the Kenya African Union, through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support but animosity from white settlers. In 1952, he was among the Kapenguria Six arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial Mau Mau Uprising. Although protesting his innocence\u2014a view shared by later historians\u2014he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at Lokitaung until 1959 and was then exiled to Lodwar until 1961.\nOn his release, Kenyatta became President of KANU and led the party to victory in the 1963 general election. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the transition of the Kenya Colony into an independent republic, of which he became president in 1964. Desiring a one-party state, he transferred regional powers to his central government, suppressed political dissent, and prohibited KANU's only rival\u2014Oginga Odinga's leftist Kenya People's Union\u2014from competing in elections. He promoted reconciliation between the country's indigenous ethnic groups and its European minority, although his relations with the Kenyan Indians were strained and Kenya's army clashed with Somali separatists in the North Eastern Province during the Shifta War. His government pursued capitalist economic policies and the \"Africanisation\" of the economy, prohibiting non-citizens from controlling key industries. Education and healthcare were expanded, while UK-funded land redistribution favoured KANU loyalists and exacerbated ethnic tensions. Under Kenyatta, Kenya joined the Organisation of African Unity and the Commonwealth of Nations, espousing a pro-Western and anti-communist foreign policy amid the Cold War. Kenyatta died in office and was succeeded by Daniel arap Moi. Kenyatta's son Uhuru later also became president.\nKenyatta was a controversial figure. Prior to Kenyan independence, many of its white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, he was given the honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation, securing support from both the black majority and the white minority with his message of reconciliation. Conversely, his rule was criticised as dictatorial, authoritarian, and neocolonial, of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of facilitating the growth of widespread corruption.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_34238", "text": "Kenyatta was an African nationalist, and was committed to the belief that European colonial rule in Africa must end. Like other anti-colonialists, he believed that under colonialism, the human and natural resources of Africa had been used not for the benefit of Africa's population but for the enrichment of the colonisers and their European homelands. For Kenyatta, independence meant not just self-rule, but an end to the colour bar and to the patronising attitudes and racist slang of Kenya's white minority. According to Murray-Brown, Kenyatta's \"basic philosophy\" throughout his life was that \"all men deserved the right to develop peacefully according to their own wishes\". Kenyatta expressed this in his statement that \"I have stood always for the purposes of human dignity in freedom, and for the values of tolerance and peace.\" This approach was similar to the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda's ideology of \"African humanism\".Murray-Brown noted that \"Kenyatta had always kept himself free from ideological commitments\", while the historian William R. Ochieng observed that \"Kenyatta articulated no particular social philosophy\". Similarly, Assensoh noted that Kenyatta was \"not interested in social philosophies and slogans\". Several commentators and biographers described him as being politically conservative, an ideological viewpoint likely bolstered by his training in functionalist anthropology. He pursued, according to Maloba, \"a conservatism that worked in concert with imperial powers and was distinctly hostile to radical politics\".Kenyatta biographer Guy Arnold described the Kenyan leader as \"a pragmatist and a moderate\", noting that his only \"radicalism\" came in the form of his \"nationalist attack\" on imperialism. Arnold also noted that Kenyatta \"absorbed a great deal of the British approach to politics: pragmatism, only dealing with problems when they become crises, [and] tolerance as long as the other side is only talking\". Donald Savage noted that Kenyatta believed in \"the importance of authority and tradition\", and that he displayed \"a remarkably consistent view of development through self-help and hard work\". Kenyatta was also an elitist and encouraged the emergence of an elite class in Kenya. He wrestled with a contradiction between his conservative desire for a renewal of traditional custom and his reformist urges to embrace Western modernity. He also faced a contradiction between his internal debates on Kikuyu ethics and belief in tribal identity with his need to create a non-tribalised Kenyan nationalism.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_34239", "text": "Kenyatta was a flamboyant character, with an extroverted personality. According to Murray-Brown, he \"liked being at the centre of life\", and was always \"a rebel at heart\" who enjoyed \"earthly pleasures\". One of Kenyatta's fellow LSE students, Elspeth Huxley, referred to him as \"a showman to his finger tips; jovial, a good companion, shrewd, fluent, quick, devious, subtle, [and] flesh-pot loving\". Kenyatta liked to dress elaborately; throughout most of his adult life, he wore finger rings and while studying at university in London took to wearing a fez and cloak and carrying a silver-topped black cane. He adopted his surname, \"Kenyatta\", after the name of a beaded belt he often wore in early life. As President he collected a variety of expensive cars.Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta had the ability to \"appear all things to all men\", also displaying a \"consummate ability to keep his true purposes and abilities to himself\", for instance concealing his connections with communists and the Soviet Union both from members of the British Labour Party and from Kikuyu figures at home. This deviousness was sometimes interpreted as dishonesty by those who met him. Referring to Kenyatta's appearance in 1920s Kenya, Murray-Brown stated the leader presented himself to Europeans as \"an agreeable if somewhat seedy 'Europeanized' native\" and to indigenous Africans as \"a sophisticated man-about-town about whose political earnestness they had certain reservations\".Simon Gikandi argued that Kenyatta, like some of his contemporaries in the Pan-African movement, was an \"Afro-Victorian\", someone whose identity had been shaped \"by the culture of colonialism and colonial institutions\", especially those of the Victorian era. During the 1920s and 1930s, Kenyatta cultivated the image of a \"colonial gentleman\"; in England, he displayed \"pleasant manners\" and a flexible attitude in adapting to urban situations dissimilar to the lands he had grown up in. A. R. Barlow, a member of the Church of Scotland Mission at Kikuyu, met with Kenyatta in Britain, later relating that he was impressed by how Kenyatta could \"mix on equal terms with Europeans and to hold his end up in spite of his handicaps, educationally and socially.\" The South African Peter Abrahams met Kenyatta in London, noting that of all the black men involved in the city's Pan-Africanist movement, he was \"the most relaxed, sophisticated and 'westernized' of the lot of us\". As President, Kenyatta often reminisced nostalgically about his time in England, referring to it as \"home\" on several occasions. Berman and Lonsdale described his life as being preoccupied with \"a search for the reconciliation of the Western modernity he embraced and an equally valued Kikuyuness he could not discard\". Gikandi argued that Kenyatta's \"identification with Englishness was much more profound than both his friends and enemies have been willing to admit\".Kenyatta has also been described as a talented orator, author, and editor. He had dictatorial and autocratic tendencies, as well as a fierce temper that could emerge as rage on occasion. Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta could be \"quite unscrupulous, even brutal\" in using others to get what he wanted, but he never displayed any physical cruelty or nihilism. Kenyatta had no racist impulses regarding white Europeans, as can, for instance, be seen through his marriage to a white English woman. He told his daughter \"the English are wonderful people to live with in England.\" He welcomed white support for his cause, so long as it was generous and unconditional, and spoke of a Kenya in which indigenous Africans, Europeans, Arabs, and Indians could all regard themselves as Kenyans, working and living alongside each other peacefully. Despite this, Kenyatta exhibited a general dislike of Indians, believing that they exploited indigenous Africans in Kenya.\n\nKenyatta was a polygamist. He viewed monogamy through an anthropological lens as an interesting Western phenomenon but did not adopt the practice himself, instead having sexual relations with a wide range of women throughout his life. Murray-Brown characterized Kenyatta as an \"affectionate father\" to his children, but one who was frequently absent. Kenyatta had two children from his first marriage with Grace Wahu: son Peter Muigai Kenyatta (born 1920), who later became a deputy minister; and daughter Margaret Kenyatta (born 1928). Margaret served as mayor of Nairobi between 1970 and 1976 and then as Kenya's ambassador to the United Nations from 1976 to 1986. Of these children, it was Margaret who was Kenyatta's closest confidante.During his trial, Kenyatta described himself as a Christian saying, \"I do not follow any particular denomination. I believe in Christianity as a whole.\" Arnold stated that in England, Kenyatta's adherence to Christianity was \"desultory\". While in London, Kenyatta had taken an interest in the atheist speakers at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, while an Irish Muslim friend had unsuccessfully urged Kenyatta to convert to Islam. During his imprisonment, Kenyatta read up on Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism through books supplied to him by Stock. The Israeli diplomat Asher Naim visited him in this period, noting that although Kenyatta was \"not a religious man, he was appreciative of the Bible\". Despite portraying himself as a Christian, he found the attitudes of many European missionaries intolerable, in particular their readiness to see everything African as evil. In Facing Mount Kenya, he challenged the missionaries' dismissive attitude toward ancestor veneration, which he instead preferred to call \"ancestor communion\". In that book's dedication, Kenyatta invoked \"ancestral spirits\" as part of \"the Fight for African Freedom.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_34240", "text": "Within Kenya, Kenyatta came to be regarded as the \"Father of the Nation\", and was given the unofficial title of Mzee, a Swahili term meaning \"grand old man\". From 1963 until his death, a cult of personality surrounded him in the country, one which deliberately interlinked Kenyan nationalism with Kenyatta's own personality. This use of Kenyatta as a popular symbol of the nation itself was furthered by the similarities between their names. He came to be regarded as a father figure not only by Kikuyu and Kenyans, but by Africans more widely.After 1963, Maloba noted, Kenyatta became \"about the most admired post-independence African leader\" on the world stage, one who Western countries hailed as a \"beloved elder statesman.\" His opinions were \"most valued\" both by conservative African politicians and by Western leaders. On becoming Kenya's leader, his anti-communist positions gained favour in the West, and some pro-Western governments gave him awards; in 1965 he, for instance, received medals from both Pope Paul VI and from the South Korean government.In 1974, Arnold referred to Kenyatta as \"one of the outstanding African leaders now living\", someone who had become \"synonymous with Kenya\". He added that Kenyatta had been \"one of the shrewdest politicians\" on the continent, regarded as \"one of the great architects of African nationalist achievement since 1945\". Kenneth O. Nyangena characterised him as \"one of the greatest men of the twentieth century\", having been \"a beacon, a rallying point for suffering Kenyans to fight for their rights, justice and freedom\" whose \"brilliance gave strength and aspiration to people beyond the boundaries of Kenya\". In 2018, Maloba described him as \"one of the legendary pioneers of modern African nationalism\". In their examination of his writings, Berman and Lonsdale described him as a \"pioneer\" for being one of the first Kikuyu to write and publish; \"his representational achievement was unique\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Around 1900, he organized the Buena Vista hockey team which played on an open-air rink at Laurier Avenue and Bronson, with an old streetcar for dressing facilities. In 1909, he married Norah Lewis, granddaughter of Archbishop John Travers Lewis and also of Sir Collingwood Schreiber.Thomas Franklin Ahearn served in World War I, as a captain in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, from 1914 until 1916, when he was injured and returned home.Mr. Ahearn became involved with the Ottawa Senators in the period when they won three Stanley Cups in four years between 1920 and 1923. In 1924, he bought out majority owner Tommy Gorman. In 1926-27, the Senators won the Cup with one of the most impressive rosters ever assembled. This imposing collection included Jack Adams, King Clancy, Alec Connell, Cy Denneny, Frank Finnigan, Hec Kilrea, Frank Nighbor and Hooley Smith.\nWinning the Stanley Cup was the last hurrah for the franchise. Due to a combination of the Great Depression and the smaller population of Ottawa, the club lost money every year after, leading the club to suspend operations for one year, move home games to other cities, and finally move to Missouri to operate as the St. Louis Eagles, and operated the Senators as an amateur/semi-professional senior club. After one season in St. Louis, the Ottawa owners sought to suspend operations again and were turned down by the league. Finally, on October 15, 1935, the Eagles and their players were bought out by the NHL, dispersing the players to other NHL teams and suspending the franchise, with a promise to pass along the proceeds if the franchise was resold.

He has been canonized as a saint in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_34275", "text": "Gregory was born around AD 213 to a wealthy pagan family in Neocaesarea (modern Niksar, then the capital of the area of Pontus in Asia Minor). Little is known of his pastoral work, and his surviving theological writings are in an incomplete state. This lack of knowledge partially obscures his personality, despite his historical importance, and his immemorial title Thaumaturgus, \"the wonder-worker\" in Latinized Greek, casts an air of legend about him. Nevertheless, the lives of few bishops of the third century are so well authenticated; the historical references to him permit a fairly detailed reconstruction of his work.Originally he was known as Theodore (\"gift of God\"), not an exclusively Christian name. He was introduced to the Christian religion at the age of fourteen, after the death of his father. He had a brother Athenodorus, and on the advice of one of their tutors, the young men were eager to study at the Berytus in Beirut, then one of the four or five famous schools in the Hellenic world. At this time, their brother-in-law was appointed assessor (legal counsel) to the Roman Governor of Palestine; the youths had therefore an occasion to act as an escort to their sister as far as Caesarea in Palestine. On arrival in that town they learned that the celebrated scholar Origen, head of the Catechetical School of Alexandria, resided there. Curiosity led them to hear and converse with the master. Soon both youths forgot all about Beirut and Roman law, and gave themselves up to the great Christian teacher, who gradually won them over to Christianity.\nIn his panegyric on Origen, Gregory describes the method employed by that master to win the confidence and esteem of those he wished to convert; how he mingled a persuasive candour with outbursts of temper and theological argument put cleverly at once and unexpectedly. Persuasive skill rather than bare reasoning, and evident sincerity and an ardent conviction were the means Origen used to make converts. Gregory took up at first the study of philosophy; theology was afterwards added, but his mind remained always inclined to philosophical study, so much so indeed that in his youth he cherished strongly the hope of demonstrating that the Christian religion was the only true and good philosophy. For seven years he underwent the mental and moral discipline of Origen (231 to 238 or 239). There is no reason to believe that his studies were interrupted by the persecutions of Maximinus of Thrace; his alleged journey to Alexandria, at this time, may therefore be considered at least doubtful, and probably never occurred.\nBefore leaving Palestine, Gregory delivered in presence of Origen a public farewell oration in which he returned thanks to the illustrious master he was leaving. This oration is valuable from many points of view. As a rhetorical exercise it exhibits the excellent training given by Origen, and his skill in developing literary taste and the amount of adulation then permissible towards a living person in an assembly composed mostly of Christians, and Christian in temper. It contains, moreover, much useful information concerning the youth of Gregory and his master's method of teaching. A letter of Origen refers to the departure of the two brothers, but it is not easy to determine whether it was written before or after the delivery of this oration. In it Origen exhorts his pupils to bring the intellectual treasures of the Greeks to the service of Christian philosophy, and thus imitate the Jews who employed the golden vessels of the Egyptians to adorn the Holy of Holies.\nGregory returned to Pontus with the intention of practising law. His plan, however, was again laid aside, for he was soon consecrated bishop of his native Neocaesarea by Phoedimus, Bishop of Amasea and metropolitan of Pontus. This fact illustrates in an interesting way the growth of the hierarchy in the primitive Church; the Christian community at Caesarea was very small, being only seventeen souls, and yet it was given a bishop. Ancient canonical documents indicate that it was possible for a community of even ten Christians to have their own bishop. When Gregory was consecrated he was forty years old, and he ruled his diocese for thirteen years.\nNothing definite is known about his methods, but he must have shown much zeal in increasing the little flock with which he began his episcopal administration. An ancient source attests to his missionary zeal by recording a curious coincidence: Gregory began with only seventeen Christians, but at his death there remained only seventeen pagans in the whole town of Caesarea. Presumably the many miracles which won for him the title of Thaumaturgus were performed during these years.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_34276", "text": "Sources on the life, teaching, and actions of Gregory Thaumaturgus are all more or less open to criticism. Besides the details given by Gregory himself, there are four other sources of information, according to K\u00f6tschau all derived from oral tradition; indeed, the differences between them force the conclusion that they cannot all be derived from one common written source. They are: \n\nLife and Panegyric of Gregory by St. Gregory of Nyssa (P.G., XLVI, col. 893 sqq.);\nHistoria Miraculorum, by Rufinus;\nan account in Syriac of the great actions of Blessed Gregory (sixth-century manuscript);\nSt. Basil, De Spiritu Sancto.Drawing on family traditions and a knowledge of the neighbourhood, the account by Gregory of Nyssa is more reliably historical than other known versions of the Thaumaturge's life. By the time of Rufinus (ca. 400), the original story was becoming confused; the Syriac account is at times obscure and contradictory. Even the life by Gregory of Nyssa exhibits a legendary element, though the facts were supplied to the writer by his grandmother, St. Macrina the Elder. He relates that before his episcopal consecration Gregory retired from Neocaesarea into a solitude, and was favoured by an apparition of the Blessed Virgin and John the Apostle, and that the latter dictated to him a creed or formula of Christian faith, of which the autograph existed at Neocaesarea when the biography was being written. The creed itself is important for the history of Christian doctrine.Gregory of Nyssa describes at length the miracles that gained for the Bishop of Caesarea the title of Thaumaturgus. It is clear that Gregory's influence must have been considerable, and his miraculous power undoubted. It might have been expected that Gregory's name would appear among those who took part in the First Council of Antioch against Paul of Samosata; probably he took part also in the second council held there against the same heresiarch, for the letter of that council is signed by a bishop named Theodore, which had been originally Gregory's name. To attract the people to the festivals in honour of the martyrs, Gregory organized profane amusements that might appeal to pagans, who were accustomed to religious ceremonies that combined solemnity with pleasure and merrymaking.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was one of the first to state and rigorously prove theorems of calculus, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors. He is one of the founders of complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra.\nA profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors; Hans Freudenthal stated:\n\n\"More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy).\"Cauchy was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks on a variety of topics in the fields of mathematics and mathematical physics.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_34317", "text": "Augustin-Louis Cauchy grew up in the house of a staunch royalist.

A paragraph from an undated letter from Louis Fran\u00e7ois to his mother in Rouen says:\nWe never had more than a one-half pound (230 g) of bread \u2014 and sometimes not even that. This we supplement with little supply of hard crackers and rice that we are allotted. Otherwise, we are getting along quite well, which is the important thing and goes to show that human beings can get by with little. I should tell you that for my children's pap I still have a bit of fine flour, made from wheat that I grew on my own land. I had three bushels, and I also have a few pounds of potato starch. It is as white as snow and very good, too, especially for very young children. It, too, was grown on my own land.  In any event, he inherited his father's staunch royalism and hence refused to take oaths to any government after the overthrow of Charles X.\nHe was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. He also had links to the Society of Jesus and defended them at the Academy when it was politically unwise to do so. His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for Charles Hermite during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic. It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the Great Famine of Ireland.\nHis royalism and religious zeal made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues. He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed. Niels Henrik Abel called him a \"bigoted Catholic\" and added he was \"mad and there is nothing that can be done about him\", but at the same time praised him as a mathematician. Cauchy's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by Joseph Liouville rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy.

His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.\nGentlemen of the jury: A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.\n\nIf fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death.\nVest won the case (the jury awarded $50 to the dog's owner) and also won its appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court.

He was the spiritual successor of the 23rd Tirthankara Parshvanatha. Mahavira was born in the early 6th century BCE into a royal Jain family of ancient India. His mother's name was Trishala and his father's name was Siddhartha. They were lay devotees of Parshvanatha. Mahavira abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of about 30 and left home in pursuit of spiritual awakening, becoming an ascetic. Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities for twelve and a half years, after which he attained Kevala Jnana (omniscience). He preached for 30 years and attained moksha (liberation) in the 6th century BCE, although the year varies by sect.\nMahavira taught that observance of the vows of ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) are necessary for spiritual liberation. He taught the principles of Anekantavada (many-sided reality): syadvada and nayavada. Mahavira's teachings were compiled by Indrabhuti Gautama (his chief disciple) as the Jain Agamas. The texts, transmitted orally by Jain monks, are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st century CE. \nMahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture, with the symbol of a lion beneath him.

But in a set of public debates at the Accademia di San Luca, the guild for artists in Rome, he strongly criticized Cortona's exuberance. The debate is significant because it indicates how two of the leading proponents of the prevailing styles in painting, now called 'Classical' and 'Baroque', discussed the differences between their work.\nIn particular, Sacchi advocated that since a unique, individual expression, gesture and movement needed to be assigned to each figure in a composition, so a painting should only have a few figures.:\u200a263\u200a In a crowded composition, the figures would be deprived of individuality, and thus cloud the particular meaning of the piece. In some ways this was a reaction against the zealous excess of crowds in paintings by artists such as Zuccari in the previous generation, and by Cortona among his contemporaries. Simplicity and unity were essential to Sacchi who, drawing an analogy to poetry, likened painting to tragedy. In his counter-argument, Cortona made the case that large paintings with many figures were like an epic which could develop multiple sub-themes. But for Sacchi, the encrustation of a painting with excess decorative details, including melees of crowds, would represent something akin to 'wall-paper' art rather than focused narrative. Among the partisans of Sacchi's argument for simplicity and focus were his friends, the sculptor Algardi and painter Poussin. The controversy was however less pitched and monolithic than some might suggest. In fact, Poussin's biographer Bellori recounts that the artist 'used to laugh at those who contract for a [history painting] with six or eight figures or some other fixed number.':\u200a343\u200a Sacchi and Albani, among others, shared dissatisfaction with the artistic depiction of low or genre subjects and themes, such as those preferred by the Bamboccianti and even the Caravaggisti. They felt that high art should focus on exalted themes\u2014biblical, mythological, or from classical ancient history.\nSacchi, who worked almost always in Rome, left few pictures visible in private galleries. He had a flourishing school: Carlo Maratta was a younger collaborator or pupil. In Maratta's large studio, Sacchi's preference for a grand manner style would find pre-eminence among Roman circles for decades to follow. But many others worked under him or his influence including Francesco Fiorelli, Luigi Garzi, Francesco Lauri, Andrea Camassei, and Giacinto Gimignani.

He has three brothers: \u00c9ric, a writer under the name of Raoul Rabut, Bruno (aka Basile de Koch) and Olivier, a business executive. In the late 1970s \u00c9ric, Bruno and Marc founded the satirical comedy troupe Groupe d'Intervention culturelle Jalons. 1979 Z\u00e9ro met his later wife and mother of their three children Anne-Laure Chaptel (today's stage name: Daisy d'Errata) in the lyceum both were attending. Anne-Laure as well as Bruno\u2019s wife Virginie (Frigide Barjot) later on became members of the Jalons.\nZ\u00e9ro's first publication was a comic entitled The Adventures of Edmond in the magazine Jalons in the early 1980s. Subsequently, he started to work for the publications M\u00e9tal Hurlant, Charlie Hebdo, Zoulou, and L'\u00c9cho des savanes, first as an artist and then as a story writer. At the same time, in 1981, he started working for the trendy magazine Actuel as a journalist specialising in interviewing stars. He also joined the just formed team of Radio Nova, working alongside his future wife, Daisy d\u2019Errata. He then joined Globe and Lui, where his talents as an interviewer attracted notice. For a few months he hosted a comedy radio show on RFM with Antoine de Caunes and Albert Algoud called Babebibou.\nIn 1986, Karl Z\u00e9ro was hired by Europe 1 to host their show G\u00e9ant Gratuit (Free Giant) with Doug Headline (son of Jean-Patrick Manchette). They would be let go after four months. Z\u00e9ro then returned to TF1 while Doug devoted himself to film. At TF1, Z\u00e9ro's show Pirates with Jean-Yves Lafesse lasted for only one episode in September 1987. Again, his sense of humour was considered 'inappropriate' and he was let go.\nAlain de Greef of Canal+ (a French pay for view TV channel) then offered him the direction of Nulle part ailleurs (Nowhere else) with his old collaborator Antoine de Caunes. He made use of video gags to bring political personalities into his sketches, which often focussed on current events. In 1993 he successfully proposed adding a television news report parody called \"Zerorama\", \"telling events of moral rearmament\", in which he used a mode of presentation and tone inspired by newsreels of the Vichy regime under Philippe P\u00e9tain in order to satirise \u00c9douard Balladur's government and the media supporting it. Also in 1993, he directed an offbeat film called Le Tronc, in which he appeared alongside Albert Algoud, Jos\u00e9 Garcia and Lova Moor.\nFrom September 1996 to June 2006, he was the presenter of Le Vrai Journal on Canal +, a television news show with the intention of 'saying out loud' what other French news shows 'kept hidden'. Karl Z\u00e9ro is not a journalist and does not have press credentials. In the show, he mixed classic news reports, usually filmed by the CAPA Agency, and sketches using video gags, in which his wife Daisy d'Errata frequently played a part. When talking with politicians, he attempted to make them accept the informal mode of address. Over 10 seasons, his audience remained steady at a 10% market share, i.e., 1.5 million viewers a week. He became the reference point for politicians who wanted to reach young people.\nBetween 2000 and 2002, he published a printed offshoot of the show, le Vrai Papier Journal. Also from September 2001 to June 2002, at the suggestion of Eric Guillaumond, he co-produced with Michel Malaussena Le journal des bonnes nouvelles, also on Canal +. In March 2003 this was renamed Le contre-journal. He also produced 60 jours 60 nuits, which told the story of the intersecting lives of Joeystarr and Francis Lalanne.\nIn 2004, Z\u00e9ro also hosted C\u2019est quoi ce jeu? on Canal +.\nIn 1996, when Le Vrai journal was beginning, Karl Z\u00e9ro agreed to John Paul Lepers' request that he meet with Pierre Carles, who had been censured a year earlier by Canal + for his film criticising TV journalism, Pas vu \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9. Carles proposed filming an expos\u00e9 of Canal + censorship, which Z\u00e9ro was naturally unable to do on that same network. Carles' second proposal, on Jacques Chirac's practice of choosing the journalists who would interview him, notably Michel Field, who at the time also worked for Canal +, was also rejected, this time by Alain de Greef, who was head of programming. In 1998 Carles produced a film titled Pas vu pas pris in which he juxtaposed statements by Karl Z\u00e9ro on his desire to say and show anything on his show with telephone conversations between the two in which he alluded to oversight by his bosses. Z\u00e9ro, for his part, deplored Carles' wasting his time \"beating down open doors\", saying that \"When one works for a television network, they're the ones who have the final cut\".\nA Catholic, Karl Z\u00e9ro nonetheless does not hide his sympathy for alter-mundialist positions.  His shows are produced by his own production company, La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du spectacle, which is currently 50% owned by Endemol, which specialises in reality television.\nIn June 2003, with network consent and without naming them, he read aloud on the air the accusations of the serial killer Patrice Al\u00e8gre (in the form of a letter which he had received from him) and of two former prostitutes that certain prominent people in Toulouse were involved in a sado-masochistic group which had covered up sexual assault, torture and murder. One of the accused was later found innocent. It also appeared that Z\u00e9ro had paid one of the ex-prostitutes \u20ac15,000 as an advance on a book. The possible violation of journalistic ethics, frequent mentions of Z\u00e9ro and Canal + in publicity about the accusations, and resulting political pressure contributed to the termination of his contract for Le Vrai Journal in June 2006. After three years of investigation, in March 2007 Judge Nathalie Turquey excused Karl Z\u00e9ro from the necessity of appearing in the case, subject to future appeals.Karl Z\u00e9ro's blog, video, and forum site Web 2 Z\u00e9ro has hosted many videos by his fans, the 'z\u00e9ronautes', and interviews especially with September 11 Truth advocates, a position in which he is interested. Also online, in 2006\u201307 he hosted on AOL Le Club du Net, a weekly round-up of interviews concerning the French presidential election campaign produced by Power Podcast, and in mid-March 2007 JT2Zero, a daily video on demand online newscast about the campaign produced by Havas Media. Z\u00e9ro supported the candidacy of Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, and in his official campaign clips, Z\u00e9ro was the interviewer.\nSince September 2007, Karl Z\u00e9ro has hosted a segment called \"Les Faits Karl Z\u00e9ro\" on 13e Rue, a show on unsolved crimes produced by Troisi\u00e8me \u0152il, and beginning in spring 2010 was to host 90-minute spin-off shows in prime time.\nIn January 2008, he accepted a position as head of the media division of the Belgian holding group Rentabiliweb.\nSince September 2008, Karl Z\u00e9ro has had a daily prime-time show on BFM TV. Initially an interview show called Karl Z\u00e9ro sur BFM TV and inspired by CNN's Larry King Live, following the 2008 release of his film Starko! la saison 1 on Nicolas Sarkozy's first year as President of France, on 7 September 2009 this became Sarko Info, a parody of television news shows in which he conducts an interview following a commentary on the news by Michel Guidoni playing the part of Sarkozy as he already did in the movie.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film's success led to a television series of the same name airing on NBC from September 1967 to February 1968 and lasting 18 episodes.

He was born in San Francisco, California to Gum Yung Sen and his first wife, both immigrants from China.When his mother died during the flu epidemic of 1919, his father placed Victor and his younger sister, Rosemary, in a children's shelter, and returned to his homeland to seek another wife. He returned in 1922 with his new wife, Lovi Shee, once again forming a household with his two children.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_34551", "text": "Sen Yung made his first significant acting debut in the 1938 film Charlie Chan in Honolulu, as the Chinese detective's \"number two son\", Jimmy Chan. In this movie, Sidney Toler replaced the recently deceased Warner Oland as Charlie Chan and Sen Yung replaced Oland's \"number one son\" Lee, who had been played by Keye Luke. Luke left the series in 1938, leading to the need for a \"number two son\". Sen Yung played Jimmy Chan in 11 Charlie Chan films between 1938 and 1942. Sen Yung played the character of Jimmy Chan very much as Luke played Lee Chan, namely as the bumbling, Americanized son who constantly hinders his father's work. The cultural clash between Chan p\u00e8re, a Chinese immigrant whose values were fundamentally those of China as expressed in his amusing pseudo-Confucian aphorisms vs. his well meaning, but inept Americanized sons gave the series much of its appeal, together with the fact that for all of Charlie Chan's putdowns of his sons there was a genuine paternal love and warmth being expressed.Moonlighting from the popular Chan series, Sen Yung won critical acclaim playing the nuanced role of Ong Chi Seng, a young attorney assisting Howard Joyce (played by James Stephenson), defending Leslie Crosbie (played by Bette Davis), accused of murder in the classic Warner Bros. film noir melodrama, The Letter (1940), directed by William Wyler. In common with other Chinese-American actors, Sen Yung was cast in Japanese parts during World War II, such as his role as the treacherous Japanese-American Joe Totsuiko in the 1942 Humphrey Bogart film Across the Pacific.\nDuring World War II he joined the U.S. Army Air Forces just as his erstwhile co-star Sidney Toler was set to revive the dormant Charlie Chan series at Monogram Pictures. According to author James L. Neibaur, Sen Yung's military obligations forced him to decline rejoining the series immediately, but Monogram gave him a standing invitation to work there when his tour of duty was up. He was temporarily replaced in the Charlie Chan series by Benson Fong, who played \"number three son\" Tommy Chan (and once by Keye Luke's real-life brother, Edwin Luke, as \"number four son\" Eddie Chan). Sen Yung's military service included work in training films at the First Motion Picture Unit and a role in the Army Air Forces' play and film Winged Victory.\nIn 1946 Sen Yung resumed his Hollywood career at Monogram, now billed as Victor Sen Young and reunited with Sidney Toler. Toler's health was failing; Monogram was conserving Toler's waning energy, limiting his scenes and giving him long rest periods during filming. To relieve the burden on Toler, Monogram entrusted much of the action to Victor Sen Young; he and either Mantan Moreland or Willie Best shared much of the footage in Toler's final three films, Dangerous Money, Shadows Over Chinatown, and The Trap. The addition of Moreland as Chan's black chauffeur, Birmingham Brown, reflected the fact that by this time the Chan pictures had a significant following among black Americans, who liked a film series that for once did not feature a white hero. Moreland's popularity in the Chan pictures was so great that he was booked for a nationwide vaudeville tour, forcing him to be replaced in Dangerous Money by Willie Best.\nFollowing Toler's death in 1947, Victor Sen Young appeared in five of the remaining six Charlie Chan features. His character \"Jimmy\" was renamed \"Tommy\" (author Scott MacGillivray contends that \"Jimmy\" was so closely associated with Sidney Toler that audiences would miss seeing Toler opposite him, resulting in Monogram making the change).  \nVictor Sen Young continued to work in motion pictures and television, in roles ranging from featured players (affable or earnest Asian characters) to bit roles (clerks, houseboys, waiters, etc.). He was cast as the compassionate Chinese restaurant owner \"Quong Kee\" in Tombstone, Arizona, in the 1957 episode, \"Quong Kee\", of the syndicated television anthology series Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story, an aging Quong Kee recalls how in 1881 he brought together the Bostonians Art Gresham (Walter Kelley) and his mother (played by Mary Newton) with the saloon musician Ann Bailey (Eugenia Paul), who after a topsy-turvy romance became Mrs. Art Gresham.Arguably even more than for his work in the Charlie Chan films, Victor Sen Yung is well remembered as \"Hop Sing,\" the irascible cook and general factotum on the iconic television series Bonanza, appearing in 107 episodes between 1959 and 1973.Bonanza series creator David Dortort told the Archive of American Television that the \"Hop Sing\" character generated massive fandom - \"Victor was just absolutely delightful. He loved the part; he loved doing it. In fact, he began to develop fans, to the extent that I wrote him in as the featured part in a number of shows.\u201dIn Bachelor Father (1957-62), Victor Sen Yung had a recurring role as the scheming \"Uncle Charlie\", a character that Asian rights activist Guy Aoki commends as \"a slick, Americanized character. I thought it was great that way back in the \u201950s, audiences saw a Chinese American who acted just like anyone else.\"In the early 1970s, Sen Yung had a recurring role in seven episodes of the tv series Kung Fu, which starred David Carradine as a Shaolin monk, also in the Old West.\nSen Yung was also an accomplished and talented chef.

Throughout his career, Belushi had a personal and artistic partnership with his fellow SNL star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while they were both working at Chicago's Second City comedy club.Born in Chicago to Albanian-American parents, Belushi started his own comedy troupe with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas, called \"The West Compass Trio\". After being discovered by Bernard Sahlins, he performed with The Second City and met Dan Aykroyd, Brian Doyle-Murray, and Harold Ramis. In 1975, Chevy Chase and Michael O'Donoghue recommended Belushi to SNL creator and showrunner Lorne Michaels, who accepted him as a new cast member of the show after an audition. Belushi developed a series of characters on the show that reached great success, including his performances as Henry Kissinger and Ludwig van Beethoven. Belushi appeared in the films National Lampoon's Animal House, 1941, The Blues Brothers, and Neighbors. He also pursued interests in music: with Aykroyd, Lou Marini, Tom Malone, Steve Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, and Paul Shaffer, he founded The Blues Brothers, which led to the film of the same name.\nBelushi struggled with heavy drug abuse that threatened his comedy career; more than once, he was dismissed from SNL due to his behavior (and then rehired). In 1982, he died from combined drug intoxication at the age of 33, after a drug dealer, Cathy Smith, injected him with a mixture of heroin and cocaine (known as a speedball) at the Chateau Marmont.

He began using cocaine (both snorting and freebasing) in the early to mid 1970s. He had managed to refrain from drug use for a brief period during the production of Continental Divide, but severely relapsed during the production of Neighbors. Less than four months after the filming on Neighbors ended, on the evening of February 28, 1982, Belushi moved out of his house and checked in to a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. For several days, he did drugs in his bungalow and wandered from nightclub to nightclub on the Sunset Strip and on Santa Monica Blvd.On March 4, 1982, Belushi visited the Los Angeles office of his long-time manager Bernie Brillstein and asked him for money. Brillstein declined, suspecting that Belushi wanted money for drugs. Later that day, Belushi returned and again asked for money while Brillstein was in a meeting with someone. Brillstein was reluctant to rebuke Belushi in front of the other person and gave him the money. In the early morning hours of March 5, Belushi, while in his Chateau Marmont bungalow, was visited separately by friends Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, as well as drug dealer Cathy Smith.Around 12:00 pm PST on Friday, March 5, 1982, Belushi's fitness trainer and occasional bodyguard Bill Wallace arrived at Belushi's bungalow at the Chateau Marmont to deliver a typewriter and audio cassette recorder because Belushi had requested them the previous day. Wallace found Belushi dead, with no one else present in the bungalow. Neither law enforcement nor a representative of the coroner's office revealed any details for almost six days. On the morning of March 11, Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi announced that the cause of death was combined drug intoxication involving cocaine and heroin, a drug combination known as a speedball.Belushi's death was eventually investigated by forensic pathologist Michael Baden who determined his death was caused by heroin.Cathy Smith was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) on March 5, 1982, because she was under suspicion for possession of narcotics, not because of Belushi's death. Later in 1982, Rolling Stone magazine described the circumstances of her arrest as follows: \"On the afternoon of March 5th, Cathy Evelyn Smith had appeared driving the wrong way into the one-way exit of the Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Strip behind the wheel of John Belushi's rented red Mercedes ... At that moment, a hundred feet away, Belushi lay naked and dead on the floor of his $200-a-day bungalow. The police who had cordoned off the area were reflexively insisting it had been 'death from natural causes'.\" The LAPD released Smith after questioning.In an interview with the National Enquirer in May 1982, Smith admitted that she had been with Belushi at the Chateau Marmont on the night of his death and had given him the fatal speedball shot. After the appearance of the Enquirer article, the case was reopened. Smith was arrested, extradited from Canada, and charged with first-degree murder. Her case was delayed by lawyers' negotiations for four years while she remained free, then she was convicted and incarcerated. A plea bargain reduced the charge to involuntary manslaughter, and she served fifteen months in prison.\nSmith, 39, pleaded no contest June 11, 1986, to involuntary manslaughter and three counts of furnishing and administering controlled substances to Belushi, 33, in the hours before he was found dead on March 5, 1982, in a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood.\n\nJohn Belushi would not have died when he died except for the heroin that was furnished and administered by the defendant.\u2014 LA county prosecutor's office\nIn 1982, Belushi's widow Judith arranged for a traditional Orthodox Christian funeral that was conducted by an Albanian Orthodox priest.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_34563", "text": "During the first live SNL episode following Belushi's death with host Robert Urich and musical guest Mink DeVille, airing live on March 20, 1982, cast member Brian Doyle-Murray gave a tribute to him.

Since then, Slimer has been described as \"the ghost of John Belushi\" by Aykroyd in many interviews.\nBelushi's life was detailed in two books: the 1984 biography Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi by Bob Woodward, the accuracy of which has been questioned by journalists and by people close to Belushi, and the 1990 memoir Samurai Widow by his widow Judith. Woodward's book was adapted into a film of the same name in 1989, which was denounced by Aykroyd and Judith, and was given poor reviews by critics. Belushi's career and death were prominently featured in the 1999 memoir of his manager Bernie Brillstein, who wrote that he was haunted by the comedian's overdose and had since learned how to better deal with clients who abuse drugs or alcohol.Eddie Money wrote \"Passing by the Graveyard (Song for John B.)\", from his 1982 album No Control, in tribute to Belushi.

The thrash metal group Anthrax penned a song about Belushi on their 1987 album Among the Living, titled \"Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.).\" Polish rock band Lady Pank recorded a song \"John Belushi\" for their 1988 album Tacy sami, with references to his Albanian ancestry.\nBelushi has been portrayed by actors Eric Siegel in Gilda Radner: It's Always Something, Tyler Labine in Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Mork & Mindy (which also features his friendship with Robin Williams), Michael Chiklis in Wired, and John Gemberling in A Futile and Stupid Gesture. Chris Farley, who was heavily influenced by Belushi, died in 1997 at age 33 due to a drug overdose, which has fueled many comparisons between Belushi and Farley.\nIn 2004, Belushi was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star located at 6355 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2006, Biography Channel aired an episode of Final 24, a documentary following Belushi during the last 24 hours leading to his death. Four years later, Biography aired a full documentary of Belushi's life. In 2015, Belushi was ranked by Rolling Stone as the greatest SNL cast member of all time.Belushi's widow later remarried and is now Judith Jacklin Belushi Pisano. Co-biographer Tanner Colby and she produced Belushi: A Biography, a collection of first-person interviews and photographs of Belushi's life that was published in 2005.\nAccording to SNL castmate Jane Curtin, who appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2011, Belushi was a misogynist who would deliberately sabotage the work of female writers and comics while working on the show: \"So you'd go to a table read, and if a woman writer had written a piece for John, he would not read it in his full voice. He felt as though it was his duty to sabotage pieces written by women.\" SNL writer Anne Beatts suggested that because she was writing a book with his wife at the time, Belushi was frustrated with them spending more time on the book than with him. He complained to Michaels about Beatts and Rosie Shuster. Judith said that Belushi was a \"Women's Libber\" and did not hate women.", "hasanswer": false}]}

From 1824 to 1839, he was the editor of C\u00e4cilia, a musical periodical published in Mainz, which influenced musical thought in Germany during the early Romantic era.\nHis most important work is his Versuch einer geordneten Theorie der Tonsetzkunst (\"Theory of Musical Composition\") (Mainz: B. Schott, 1817\u201321), which introduced several concepts that have since become important in the study of music theory. In this work, Weber develops the idea of \"Mehrdeutigkeit\" (that is, \"multiple meaning\"), a term initially introduced by Georg Joseph Vogler. Weber's \"multiple meaning\" refers to individual tones and harmonies, based on their context in a piece of music. For example, a C major triad may serve as I in C major, IV in G major, V in F major, etc. \"To analyze a chord, a theorist must ask not only 'What notes are in it?' but also 'How is it behaving in the harmonic progression?'\" (Thompson); see diatonic function. In the same work, Weber also further develops Vogler's idea of Roman numeral designations applied to chords. Unlike Vogler, Weber implements upper and lower case symbols to show not only the position of each chord related to the scale degree upon which it is built, but also the quality of each chord, i.e. major, minor, diminished, etc. Weber's Roman numeral system of analysis is in wide use in universities all over the world today to varying degrees, albeit with some modifications.\nWeber's Theory of Musical Composition was the first work on music theory to be translated into English for publication in the United States (transl. by James F. Warner, Boston: Oliver Ditson, 1846).\nHe died in Bad Kreuznach.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although popular artwork of the time consisted of heavy political agendas like those found in the Mexican Muralism Movement, Gironella did not participate in such agendas. On the contrary, Gironella rejected all art forms that intertwined with politics and became heavily influenced by surrealism and baroque portraiture. Shortly after discovering his painting style, Gironella was instrumental in the founding of the avant-garde art gallery, Galer\u00eda Prisse, along with fellow Mexican artist Vlady Kibalchich Rusakov and H\u00e9ctor Xavier. Galer\u00eda Prisse was a major factor in disturbing the political artworks of the time but this did not prevent Gironella from receiving criticism nor the questioning of his style. Gironella's artwork continues to be shared by his son, Emiliano Gironella, and was showcased in the plastic \"Forgetting Vel\u00e1zquez. The Meninas\" exhibition in Barcelona alongside his favorite artists Picasso, Vel\u00e1zquez, and Goya in 2008.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_34591", "text": "Gironella was inspired by popular Surrealist artists in Mexico as well as many controversial artists of the Mexican Muralism movement such as David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera. Although surrealism differs drastically from the politically driven muralist movement, Gironella found that both distinct art forms resonated with his need to push creative boundaries.\nEven though he was a supporter and advocate of more liberal political views, Gironella's impressions of the Mexican Muralism movement led him to believe that art should not be political, rather, it should be representative of one's subconscious mind. By rejecting the politically influenced artistic styles, Gironella found himself captivated by the avant-garde art movement surrealism. Surrealism sought to create art that was representational of the capabilities of the unconscious mind, a polar opposite of the Mexican Muralism Movement. Gironella is said to contribute this fascination with the colorful avant-garde style to deeply rooted memories in his childhood. Recounting that some of his earliest memories being of himself assembling alters with chocolate rappers, vibrant tins, and bottles from the family owed grocery store. This specific inspiration is said to derive from his love of Leonora Carrington's surrealism that was introduced to the new world in the 1940s, as well as his friendship with the film maker Luis Bu\u00f1uel.\nHaving immersed himself in surrealism, Gironella's artwork caught the attention of the popular French Surrealist artist Andre Breton. During Gironella's first solo exhibition in Paris in 1961, Breton was described to have been enthralled by the artwork, claiming that Gironella's passion and work were proof that surrealism was still alive and strong within the art community. It is important to note, however, that Gironella did not perceive himself solely as a surrealist artist, claiming that he was just as much a baroque artist and labels were not necessary. The fact that not even Gironella himself could pinpoint his exact style could perhaps be said to have been a precursor to future art admirers also not being able to categorize his work. Nonetheless, Gironella's artwork has left a lasting impression on many artist and admirers around the world", "hasanswer": false}]}

They finished in first place after the preliminary round with an 8\u20131 round robin record. This earned them the top seed in the playoff round. They then, however, lost the semifinal to Japan's Satsuki Fujisawa and the bronze medal game to Sweden's Anna Hasselborg, placing fourth. Immediately after the Olympics, the team entered the Swiss Women's Curling Championship where they were once again able to defend their title, earning the right to represent Switzerland at the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship. At the championship, Team Tirinzoni dominated the competition, finishing the round robin with an unblemished 12\u20130 record. They then beat Sweden's Hasselborg in the semifinal to qualify once again for the world championship final where they would face South Korea's Kim Eun-jung. Switzerland took a three-point lead early, but Korea was able to tie the match later on. In the end, P\u00e4tz executed an open hit to win the match 7\u20136 and repeat for a third time as world women's curling champions. On April 25, the team announced that they would be splitting up at the end of the season, with front end Esther Neuenschwander and Melanie Barbezat stepping away from competitive curling. Team Tirinzoni ended their four-year run together with the final two Slam events of the season, the 2022 Players' Championship and the 2022 Champions Cup, where they had quarterfinal and semifinal finishes respectively. On May 12, P\u00e4tz and Tirinzoni announced that they would be staying together and adding Carole Howald and Briar Schwaller-H\u00fcrlimann to their team for the 2022\u201323 season. Also during the 2021\u201322 season, P\u00e4tz competed in the 2022 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship with boyfriend Sven Michel. The pair went 7\u20132 through the round robin and won a tight semifinal over Norway to reach the gold medal match. There, they fell 9\u20137 to Eve Muirhead and Bobby Lammie of Scotland, earning the silver medal.The new Tirinzoni rink found immediate success on tour, going undefeated in their first event to win the Summer Series. The following week, they lost to Team Clancy Grandy in the final of the 2022 Martensville International. The team next competed in the 2022 Women's Masters Basel where they lost in the semifinal to Raphaela Keiser. They bounced back immediately the following week at the 2022 Stu Sells Toronto Tankard, again going undefeated to claim their second event title of the season. Team Tirinzoni continued their strong play into the first Slam event of the season, the 2022 National. After an undefeated round robin record, the team beat Jennifer Jones 7\u20133 in the quarterfinals, Kaitlyn Lawes 7\u20135 in the semifinals, and Kerri Einarson 7\u20133 in the championship game to win their third tour event and P\u00e4tz's second Grand Slam title. The team was back on the ice the following week at the 2022 Western Showdown where after dropping their first game, they won seven straight to claim another title. Team Tirinzoni's event streak came to an end at the 2022 Tour Challenge where after a 4\u20130 round robin record, they lost 9\u20132 in the quarterfinals to Isabella Wran\u00e5. Next for the team was the 2022 European Curling Championships where they finished third in the round robin with a 6\u20133 record. They then beat Italy's Stefania Constantini in the semifinal before dropping the championship game 8\u20134 to Denmark's Madeleine Dupont. After much success in the first half of the season, the team missed the playoffs at their next two events, the 2022 Masters and the 2023 Canadian Open. They rebounded, however, at the 2023 International Bernese Ladies Cup, going a perfect 8\u20130 to win the event. At the 2023 Swiss Women's Curling Championship, the team defended their title for a third year in a row, winning 6\u20134 over Corrie H\u00fcrlimann in the championship game. This qualified Team Tirinzoni for the 2023 World Women's Curling Championship where they continued their winning streak at the World Championship, again going 12\u20130 through the round robin. They then topped Sweden's Anna Hasselborg 8\u20134 to qualify for the final against Norway's Marianne R\u00f8rvik. Despite not having their best game, the Swiss team stole two in the tenth end to win the game 6\u20133 and secure their fourth consecutive World Championship title. With the win, the team also took the record for the most consecutive victories at the Women's World Championship, now at 36 games. Team Tirinzoni ended their season at the final two Slams of the season, the 2023 Players' Championship and the 2023 Champions Cup. At the Players', the team lost two straight before going on a six-game winning streak to qualify for the final. There, they lost 6\u20135 to Isabella Wran\u00e5. Prior to the Champions Cup, the team's last event of the season, they announced they had removed Briar Schwaller-H\u00fcrlimann from the team for \"team harmony\" reasons. The team made the decision while Schwaller-H\u00fcrlimann was playing in the 2023 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship, but did not tell her until she travelled to Canada to play in the Champions Cup. Schwaller-H\u00fcrlimann was replaced by Rachel Erickson at the tournament, where they missed the playoffs with a 1\u20134 record.

At the age of sixteen, he was sent to the court of Spain as a page to the future emperor Charles V, to whom Ferrante remained faithful for his whole life. In 1527 he took part in the Sack of Rome and attended Charles' triumphant coronation at Bologna in 1530: at the death of Charles of Bourbon (1527) he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Imperial army in Italy. He became a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1531.\nHe defended Naples from the assault of the French troops under Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec, and obtained the surrender of the Republic of Florence. For this feat Pope Clement VII, a member of the Medici who had been ousted from that city, named him papal governor of Benevento. Again for Charles V, he fought against the Turks at Tunis in 1535 and Algiers in 1541 with a contingent of 3,000 cavalry. He served Charles as Viceroy of Sicily (1535\u20131546), and Forte Gonzaga was named in his honour. He accompanied the Emperor to Germany in 1543 and fought the resolute campaign that enforced the Treaty of Cr\u00e9py. He then served as Governor of the Duchy of Milan (1546\u20131554), in which role he fought in the War of Parma.\nIn 1529 Ferrante married Isabella di Capua, who brought him the fiefdoms of Molfetta and Giovinazzo and thanks to this marriage he became one of the major feudal lords of the Kingdom of Naples. In 1539 he bought the countship of Guastalla, on the left bank of the Po for 22,280 golden scudi from Countess Ludovica Torelli; this guaranteed him the rank of sovereign prince of the Holy Roman Empire, because the County of Guastalla enjoyed very broad autonomy and practically almost independence, despite its limited size. This acquisition was in part also a strategic purchase, for Guastalla lies near Ferrara, which Charles wished to take from the Este.Ferrante's villa near Milan, La Gualtiera, is now known as La Simonetta. Ferrante rebuilt it in the 1550s, commissioning the services of the Tuscan architect Domenico Giuntallodi of Prato. Ferrante was a patron and protector of the sculptor and medallist Leone Leoni, who executed a bronze medal for him about 1555, with a reverse that depicts Hercules with upraised club besting the Nemean Lion and the legend TV NE CEDE MALIS, \"You do not yield to evil\", alluding to his acquittal after indictment for misappropriation of funds and corruption. His son Cesare commissioned from Leone a more public monument, a bronze Triumph of Ferrante Gonzaga over Envy, (1564), which stands in Piazza Roma, Guastalla.

He illustrated the first, 1823 English translation (by Edgar Taylor and David Jardine) of Grimms' Fairy Tales, published in two volumes as German Popular Stories.On 16 October 1827, he married Mary Ann Walker (1807\u20131849).

He achieved early success collaborating with William Hone in his political satire The Political House That Jack Built (1819). In the same year he produced the now-infamous anti-abolitionist piece The New Union Club. It satirised a dinner party organised by abolitionists with black guests. While this piece was praised as \"the finest of G.C.'s caricatures\" during the 19th century, it is now viewed as one of the most racist prints of its era. His 1819 print, The Belle Alliance, or the Female Reformers of Blackburn!!!, criticised the role of women in the reform movement, portraying them as unfeminine and grotesque.His first major work was Pierce Egan's Life in London (1821) in which the characters Tom and Jerry, two 'men about town' visit various London locations and taverns to enjoy themselves and carouse. This was followed by The Comic Almanack (1835\u20131853) and Omnibus (1842). Cruikshank gained notoriety with his political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians. In 1820 he received a royal bribe of \u00a3100 for a pledge \"not to caricature His Majesty\" (George IV of the United Kingdom) \"in any immoral situation\". His work included a personification of England named John Bull who was developed from about 1790 in conjunction with other British satirical artists such as James Gillray, and Thomas Rowlandson.Cruikshank replaced one of his major influences, James Gillray, as England's most popular satirist. For a generation he delineated Tories, Whigs and Radicals impartially. Satirical material came to him from every public event \u2013 wars abroad, the enemies of Britain (he was highly patriotic), the frolic, among other qualities, such as the weird and terrible, in which he excelled. His hostility to enemies of Britain and a crude racism is evident in his illustrations commissioned to accompany William Maxwell's History of the Irish rebellion in 1798 (1845) where his lurid depictions of incidents in the rebellion were characterised by the simian-like portrayal of Irish rebels.  Among the other racially engaged works of Cruikshank there were caricatures about the \"legal barbarities\" of the Chinese, the subject given by his friend, Dr. W.

Cruikshank even acted in Dickens's amateur theatrical company.\nOn 30 December 1871, Cruikshank published a letter in The Times which claimed credit for much of the plot of Oliver Twist. The letter launched a fierce controversy around who created the work. Cruikshank was not the first Dickens illustrator to make such a claim. Robert Seymour who illustrated the Pickwick Papers suggested that the idea for that novel was originally his; however, in his preface to the 1867 edition, Dickens strenuously denied any specific input.\nThe friendship between Cruikshank and Dickens soured further when Cruikshank became a fanatical teetotaler in opposition to Dickens's views of moderation.\nIn Somerset Maugham's short story \"Miss King\", Cruickshank's influence is referenced:\n\nShe wore a large white cotton nightcap (on entering Ashenden has noticed the brown wig on a stand on the dressing-table) tied under the chin and a white voluminous nightdress that came high up in the neck.

For his efforts he was made vice president of the National Temperance League in 1856.\nWhen the invasion scare of 1859 led to the creation of the Volunteer Movement, Cruikshank was one of those who organised Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs). At first his unit was the 24th Surrey RVC, which recruited from working men who were total abstainers and was named 'Havelock's Own' in honour of Major-General Sir Henry Havelock, a hero of the Indian Mutiny and pioneer of Temperance Clubs in the army.\nHowever, Cruikshank received little encouragement from the Lord-Lieutenant of Surrey, and was rebuked for crossing into Kent to recruit. Disgusted, he disbanded his unit in 1862 and began anew in Middlesex, organising the 48th Middlesex RVC (Havelock's Temperance Volunteers).

The integration came as a result of the 1954 United States Supreme Court ruling Brown v. Board of Education. Eckford's public ordeal was captured by press photographers on the morning of September 4, 1957, after she was prevented from entering the school by the Arkansas National Guard. A dramatic snapshot by Will Counts of the Arkansas Democrat showed the young girl being followed and threatened by an angry white mob; this and other photos of the day's startling events were circulated around the US and the world by the press.Counts's image was the unanimous selection by the Pulitzer jury for a 1958 Pulitzer Prize, but since the story had earned then-rival  Arkansas Gazette two other Pulitzer Prizes already, the Pulitzer board awarded the prize to another photographer for a pleasant photograph of a two-year-old boy in Washington, D.C. A different photo taken by Counts of Alex Wilson, a black reporter for the Memphis Tri-State Defender being beaten by the angry mob in Little Rock the same day, was chosen as the \"News Picture of the Year\" for 1957 by the National Press Photographers Association. This image by Counts prompted President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send federal troops to Little Rock.Eckford only spent one year at Little Rock Central High where she and the other black students were tormented throughout.

She was subsequently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_34735", "text": "On September 4, 1957, Eckford and eight other African American students (known as the Little Rock Nine) made an unsuccessful attempt to enter Little Rock Central High School, which had been segregated. An angry mob of about 400 surrounded the school that day, with the complicity of the Arkansas National Guard.Fifteen-year-old Eckford tried to enter the school, while soldiers of the National Guard, under orders from Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus, stepped in her way to prevent her from entering. Eventually, she gave up and tried to flee to a bus stop through the mob of segregationists who surrounded and threatened to lynch her. Once Eckford got to the bus stop, she couldn't stop crying. A reporter, Benjamin Fine, having in mind his own 15-year-old daughter, sat down next to Eckford. He tried to comfort her and told her, \"don't let them see you cry.\" Soon, she was also protected by a white woman named Grace Lorch who escorted her onto a city bus.The original plan was to have the nine children arrive together, but when the meeting place was changed the night before, the Eckford family's lack of a telephone left Elizabeth uninformed of the change. Instructions were given by Daisy Bates, a strong activist for desegregation, for the nine students to wait for her so that they could all walk together to the rear entrance of the school. This last-minute change caused Elizabeth to be the first to take a different route to school, walking up to the front entrance completely alone. Elizabeth Eckford's family was not informed of the meeting and didn't know that the school board asked the parents to accompany her. Also, Eckford rode a public bus alone to the segregated school. That day, Elizabeth wore a starched black-and-white dress, and she covered her face under black sunglasses. Elizabeth also held her school book in her hand. As she walked toward the school, Elizabeth was surrounded by a crowd of armed guards and a mob of people, and she did not see any black faces. The mob included men, women, and teenagers (white students) who opposed integration. The white teenagers chanted \"Two, four, six, eight, we ain't gonna integrate.\" Elizabeth attempted to go into the school through the mob but was denied entrance. Eckford walked to a bus bench at the end of the block. Eckford described her experience:\n\nI stood looking at the school\u2014 it looked so big! Just then the guards let some white students through. The crowd was quiet. I guess they were waiting to see what was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, I walked up to the guard who had let the white students in. He didn't move. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet, and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared at me with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn't know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, \"Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!\"\nEven though Elizabeth Eckford would one day be known as a member of the Little Rock Nine, at this point in the school day, she was all alone, making her the first African-American student to integrate a white southern high school.For the next two weeks, the Little Rock Nine stayed home to study instead of going to the Little Rock Central High School. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was reluctant to do anything about the mob or the rioting. Eisenhower summoned Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas to intervene and asked for the withdrawal of all troops from the high school after Elizabeth Eckford's experience attempting to enter the school the first time.On September 23, 1957, the Little Rock Nine approached Central High again, and Elizabeth Eckford along with the other eight students, accompanied by city policemen, were let into the high school through a side door. The reaction from the mob was described as follows:\n\nThe crowd let out a roar of rage. \"They've gone in,\" a man shouted...Once the Little Rock Nine entered the school, they were separated. The mob infiltrated the school, and under threats of death, the nine were taken to the principal's office. One of the nine overheard officials saying \"We may have to let the mob have one of those kids, so's we can distract them long enough to get the others out.\"\nThe Arkansas National Guard, under orders from the governor, and an angry mob of about 400 surrounded the school and prevented them from going in. On September 23, 1957, a mob of about 1000 people surrounded the school again as the students attempted to enter. The following day, President Dwight D. Eisenhower took control of the Arkansas National Guard from the governor and sent the 101st Airborne Division to accompany the students to school for protection. Both federal troops and federalized National Guardsmen were deployed at the school for the entirety of the school year, although they were unable to prevent incidents of violence against the group inside, such as Eckford being thrown down a flight of stairs.All of the city's high schools were closed the following year, so Eckford did not graduate from Central High School. However, she had taken correspondence and night courses garnering enough credits for her high school diploma.

During the reconciliation rally of 1997, the two women made speeches together. But later their friendship broke up, with Eckford reflecting, \"[Hazel] wanted me to be cured and be over it and for this not to go on anymore. She wanted me to be less uncomfortable so that she wouldn't feel responsible.\" In 1999, President Bill Clinton presented the nation's highest civilian award, the Congressional Gold Medal, to the members of the Little Rock Nine.On the morning of January 1, 2003, one of Eckford's two sons, Erin Eckford, age 26, was shot and killed by police in Little Rock. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that the police officers had unsuccessfully tried to disarm him with a beanbag round after he had fired several shots from his rifle. When Eckford pointed his rifle towards them, the police officers shot him. His mother feared that his death was \"suicide by police\". Erin, she said, had suffered from mental illness but had been off his prescribed medication for several years. The newspaper later reported that prosecutors investigating the fatal shooting had decided that the police officers concerned were justified in shooting Eckford.In 2018, 60 years after leaving Little Rock Central High, Eckford told her story in her first autobiography, The Worst First Day: Bullied While Desegregating Little Rock Central High. The book was coauthored with Dr. Eurydice Stanley and Grace Stanley of Pensacola, Florida. Grace was 15 years old when she worked on the project, the same age Eckford was when she desegregated Central High. The Worst First Day tells Eckford's experiences in verse. It features the graphic artwork of Rachel Gibson and the photography of Will Counts.

The plates will remain affixed to the submarine throughout its life. Melba Pattillo Beals and Minnijean Brown-Trickey were also named sponsors of the ship, and all members of the Little Rock Nine were honored.

As the eldest son of a wealthy land owner, he had an idyllic childhood, filled with hunting and sports. By the time he was fourteen, he owned his own gun and hunted bear and deer. When he was old enough to drive, he was given a Singer Sports car with cushions covered with panther skin. Though he was born in a wealthy family he was always aware of the class inequality that prevailed in Indian society. \"There is a certain callousness in families like my family,\" he used to say. \"They put up strong barriers so as to avoid seeing the misery in the outside world and I rebelled against it.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_34741", "text": "Trained in law, he developed a successful legal practice in Wardha.

When Gandhi got to know that Dr. Amte had defended a girl from the lewd taunts of some British soldiers, Gandhi gave him the name \u2013 Abhay Sadhak (Fearless Seeker of Truth).However one day his encounter with a living corpse and leprosy patient Tulshiram, filled him with fear. Amte, who never feared for anything till that incident and who fought one time with British men to save the honour of an Indian lady and was also challenged by sweepers of Warora to clean the gutters, was quivered in fright on seeing plight of Tulshiram. However, Amte wanted to create a thinking and understanding that leprosy patients can be truly helped only when a society is free of \"Mental Leprosy\"-fear and wrong understanding associated with disease. To dispel this thinking he once injected himself with bacilli from a patient, to prove the ailment was not highly contagious. In those days, people with leprosy suffered a social stigma and Indian society disowned these people. Amte strove to dispel the widespread belief that leprosy was highly contagious; he even allowed bacilli from a leper to be injected into him as part of an experiment aimed at proving that leprosy was not highly contagious. But Baba Amte and his wife used to prioritise the care and treatment and mainstreaming those affected by the dreaded disease of leprosy and lived amongst the affected and ensured that they got exemplary medical care which ended the scourge of the disease for them. For the rehabilitated and cured patients he arranged vocational training and small-scale manufacturing of handicrafts and got things crafted by them. He struggled and tried to remove the stigma and ignorance surrounding the treatment of leprosy as a disease.Amte founded three ashrams for treatment and rehabilitation of leprosy patients, disabled people and people from marginalised sections of general society in Maharashtra.

In the 1980s he served his first sentence for possession of arms and forged documents. Thereafter he met a compatriot from Tambov, Valery Ledovskikh with whom he founded a gang. The gang initially invited only persons from Tambov region (thus its name, Tambovskaya). Being not yet strong enough to operate independently, the gang merged into the large criminal group Velikolukskaya (from Velikie Luki, Pskov region) and was engaged mostly in commercial racketeering.In 1989 multiple members of Kumarin's gang were convicted for the bloody firefight with another criminal gang, Malyshevskaya. The verdict was rather mild, supposedly because the state prosecutor was severely injured by unknown persons during the investigation. After having completed a short sentence, Kumarin's gang swiftly took over all across the northwestern region of Russia \u2013 Leningrad, Pskov, Novgorod, and Karelia \u2013 challenging the business affairs of his former 'host gang'. A bloody skirmish with the Velikolukskaya gang caused Kumarin to fall into a month-long coma. His right arm had to be amputated at the shoulder and bullets pierced his stomach, chest and lungs. To this day he still has bullet fragments in his heart.During the mid-1990s Kumarin attempted to legalize the criminal earnings of his gang using extensive contacts with the government of the City of St. Petersburg headed by mayor Anatoly Sobchak (1991\u20131996), to whom the current Russian president Vladimir Putin served as assistant. Kumarin was an investor to the Kirishinefteorgsintez (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0444\u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0437) oil refinery and member of the Board of Petersburg Fuel Company (PTK) controlled by Kumarin. PTK became the sole supplier of gasoline to the municipal transport of St. Petersburg.Since the late 1990s a few senior members of Kumarin's structures as well as of its adversaries were killed and a list of investigations of his past criminal affairs was published. In June 2003, the magazine Der Spiegel mentioned that, according to the German ministry of criminal affairs, the German firm St. Petersburg Real Estate Holding Company (German: St. Peterburg Immobilien und Beteiligungs AG) (SPAG) had fallen under suspicion of being involved in a money-laundering scheme through the Cali cocaine cartel with connections to Kumarin. The Russian co-owner of the SPAG's joint venture was the government of St. Petersburg, and Vladimir Putin, then the municipal official, was a member of the board from 1992 to 2000. In April 2004 German police interrogated Kumarin but no indictments were made. It has been suggested that Kumarin maintained good relations with Russian politicians Mikhail Glushenko and Alexander Filatov. Allegedly after refusing to back down from a business deal in favour of a politician close to Vladimir Putin, Kumarin was raided and arrested by 300 special forces officers on August 24, 2007. Prosecutor General Yury Chaika accused him of banditry and organizing a gang. He was also accused of the murder attempt on businessman Sergei Vasiliev, a rival in the oil business. In 2006, two men with automatic rifles sprayed Vasiliev's car with gunfire, wounding him and killing one of his bodyguards.Kumarin sought to clean up his image via donations to charities and the Russian Orthodox Church of which he was a devout follower as well as securing the release of two kidnapped children of Sergey Borodulin, Russian businessman. During this period his fame grew as well; dozens of celebrities and politicians attended his 50th birthday party in 2006. Kumarin was interviewed by Andrey Konstantinov, author of book Bandit Petersburg. Since 2004 Kumarin-Barsukov served as assistant to the St. Petersburg municipal MP, Alexander Nevzorov, well-known Russian journalist, who endorsed Kumarin as a \"perfectly clean person\" and invited Kumarin to play the role of King Louis XIV in his film. During the 1990s, however, Nevzorov covered multiple raids on Kumarin's gang on prime-time TV shows, making the gang notorious among the public.After the 2007\u20132009 investigation Kumarin was sentenced to 14 years in prison plus a fine for the episodes of racketeering, fraud, money laundering and a murder attempt. The verdict was challenged in the European Court of Human Rights and by 2011 his sentence was reduced by 2.5 years. In 2012 another long investigation into Kumarin's affairs started.

According to F\u00e9lix de Latassa y Ort\u00edn, besides history he wrote various treatises on poetry and a compendium of verse.\nVagad's magnum opus, the Cr\u00f3nica de Arag\u00f3n, a vernacular Romance history of Aragon from the mythical Kingdom of Sobrarbe (founded 724) up to the death of Alfonso V (1458), was published in Zaragoza in 1499; its incunabula survive. It was commissioned by the deputies of Ferdinand II of Aragon, who named Vagad cronista mayor (senior chronicler), though the office of cronista was not formally instituted until the Cortes of Monz\u00f3n in 1547.\nFor the work Vagad consulted the archives of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a, San Victori\u00e1n, Poblet, Montearag\u00f3n, and Barcelona among other archives of the Crown of Aragon. In international matters he was a Spanish partisan and this bias enters into his history: he considered the Emperor Maximilian I a Spaniard and made the legendary Count Julian an Italian. In peninsular matters his Aragonese bias is evident, as when he devalues the conquest of Valencia by the Castilian folk hero El Cid (1094) relative to the conquest of the same city by James I of Aragon (1236).

In the first Vagad heaps praise on Spain in the tradition of Isidore's Laus Spaniae; in the second he argues from history for the preeminence of Aragon amongst the kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula; and in the third he defends the importance of Zaragoza as the chief city of Spain.

The first two seasons spent with Philadelphia were miserable, as the Eagles won two games each, while he was an off-and-on starter. Upon his return to the Eagles in 1945, the fortunes of the team had improved, as they won at least six games and finished at least third in each year, buoyed by Thompson and Steve Van Buren (starting play with the team in 1944), who would eventually be named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.In the three-year run for the Eagles to three straight NFL championship appearances from 1947 to 1949, Thompson would throw for 57 total touchdowns while Van Buren would run for 34 touchdowns.\nIn 1948 and 1949, he would lead the league in passer rating, and his 25 touchdowns in the former year was a league high: he was just the second quarterback to lead the league in consecutive years in the category (after Ed Danowski) and just the fourth to lead the league multiple times (after Danowski, Sid Luckman, and Sammy Baugh). In 1947, the Eagles won eight of twelve games and wound up tied with Pittsburgh in the division, meaning a tiebreaker game was required to determine who would play in the NFL Championship Game\nThompson was the starting quarterback for the Eagles in the game, and went 11-of-17 for 131 yards and two touchdowns. His 15-yard score to Steve Van Buren in the first quarter proved to be the winning score, as the Eagles went on to shut out the Steelers 21\u20130. For the 1947 NFL Championship Game, there was no primary starter at quarterback on either team, although Thompson did play. Facing the Chicago Cardinals, he threw 27-of-44 passes for 297 yards for one touchdown and three interceptions. The game was mostly even-matched in passing and rushing, but the Cardinals started with a 14\u20130 lead by the time the Eagles ended up getting on the board, and after that they traded scores as the Cardinals held on to win 28\u201321, after having possession for the last five minutes.The following year, he helped lead the Eagles to another division crown. On December 19, in the 1948 NFL Championship Game, he would partake in one of the most famous weather games, as snow rained down on Shibe Park that made running an even more important commodity: each team combined for over 300 yards on the ground to just 42 passing. Facing the Cardinals once again, he went 2-of-12 for 7 yards and two interceptions while running for 50 yards on 11 carries. However, Steve Van Buren would win the game on a touchdown run early in the fourth quarter to give the Eagles the one and only score needed to win Philadelphia's first championship, with Thompson and Van Buren each getting credit from coach Greasy Neale for the win.In 1949, the Eagles were even better, losing just one game as Thompson and the team would make it to a third consecutive NFL Championship Game. Facing the upstart Los Angeles Rams on a mudpit, he threw for 5-of-9 for 68 yards with one touchdown and one interception. His 31-yard touchdown to Pete Pihos in the second quarter was both the longest pass he threw all day and the winning score as the Eagles shut out the Rams 14\u20130.Thompson closed his career in 1950 with a 6\u20136 record, having thrown for 1,608 yards with 11 touchdowns to 22 interceptions.One highlight included him becoming the fourth quarterback to ever throw for 10,000 yards in a career: for context, he finished fourth in passing yards all-time, behind Sammy Baugh, Sid Luckman and Otto Graham, all of whom were later inducted into the Hall of Fame. In the seven decades that have followed since Thompson retired, he fell from 4th to 193rd, a reflection of the growing trend in passing.Thompson is one of four eligible inactive NFL quarterbacks with multiple championships who have not yet been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, along with Jim Plunkett, Tobin Rote, and Jack Kemp.

Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century, when he was rediscovered by the Pre-Raphaelites who stimulated a reappraisal of his work. Since then, his paintings have been seen to represent the linear grace of late Italian Gothic and some Early Renaissance painting, even though they date from the latter half of the Italian Renaissance period.\nIn addition to the mythological subjects for which he is best known today, Botticelli painted a wide range of religious subjects (including dozens of renditions of the Madonna and Child, many in the round tondo shape) and also some portraits. His best-known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera, both in the Uffizi in Florence, which holds many of Botticelli's works. Botticelli lived all his life in the same neighbourhood of Florence; his only significant times elsewhere were the months he spent painting in Pisa in 1474 and the Sistine Chapel in Rome in 1481\u201382.Only one of Botticelli's paintings, the Mystic Nativity (National Gallery, London) is inscribed with a date (1501), but others can be dated with varying degrees of certainty on the basis of archival records, so the development of his style can be traced with some confidence.  He was an independent master for all the 1470s, which saw his reputation soar. The 1480s were his most successful decade, the one in which his large mythological paintings were completed along with many of his most famous Madonnas.  By the 1490s, his style became more personal and to some extent mannered. His last works show him moving in a direction opposite to that of Leonardo da Vinci (seven years his junior) and the new generation of painters creating the High Renaissance style, and instead returning to a style that many have described as more Gothic or \"archaic\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_34883", "text": "Botticelli was born in the city of Florence in a house on the street still called Borgo Ognissanti. He lived in the same area all his life and was buried in his neighbourhood church called Ognissanti (\"All Saints\").  Sandro was one of several children to the tanner Mariano di Vanni d'Amedeo Filipepi and his wife Smeralda Filipepi, and the youngest of the four who survived into adulthood. The date of his birth is not known, but his father's tax returns in following years give his age as two in 1447 and thirteen in 1458, meaning he must have been born between 1444 and 1446.In 1460 Botticelli's father ceased his business as a tanner and became a gold-beater with his other son, Antonio. This profession would have brought the family into contact with a range of artists. Giorgio Vasari, in his Life of Botticelli, reported that Botticelli was initially trained as a goldsmith.The Ognissanti neighbourhood was \"a modest one, inhabited by weavers and other workmen,\" but there were some rich families, most notably the Rucellai, a wealthy clan of bankers and wool-merchants. The family's head, Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai, commissioned the famous Palazzo Rucellai, a landmark in Italian Renaissance architecture, from Leon Battista Alberti, between 1446 and 1451, Botticelli's earliest years. By 1458, Botticelli's family was renting their house from the Rucellai, which was just one of many dealings that involved the two families.In 1464, his father bought a house in the nearby Via Nuova (now called Via della Porcellana) in which Sandro lived from 1470 (if not  earlier) until his death in 1510. Botticelli both lived and worked in the house (a rather unusual practice) despite his brothers Giovanni and Simone also being resident there. The family's most notable neighbours were the Vespucci, including Amerigo Vespucci, after whom the Americas were named. The Vespucci were Medici allies and eventually regular patrons of Botticelli.The nickname Botticelli, meaning \"little barrel\", derives from the nickname of Sandro's brother, Giovanni, who was called Botticello apparently because of his round stature. A document of 1470 refers to Sandro as \"Sandro Mariano Botticelli\", meaning that he had fully adopted the name.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_34884", "text": "From around 1461 or 1462 Botticelli was apprenticed to Fra Filippo Lippi, one of the leading Florentine painters and a favorite of the Medici.  It was from Lippi that Botticelli learned how to create intimate compositions with beautiful, melancholic figures drawn with clear contours and only slight contrasts of light and shadow.  For much of this period Lippi was based in Prato, a few miles west of Florence, frescoing the apse of what is now Prato Cathedral. Botticelli probably left Lippi's workshop by April 1467, when the latter went to work in Spoleto. There has been much speculation as to whether Botticelli spent a shorter period of time in another workshop, such as that of the Pollaiuolo brothers or Andrea del Verrocchio. However, although both artists had a strong impact on the young Botticelli's development, the young artist's presence in their workshops cannot be definitively proven.Lippi died in 1469. Botticelli must have had his own workshop by then, and in June of that year he was commissioned a panel of Fortitude (Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi) to accompany a set of all Seven Virtues commissioned one year earlier from Piero del Pollaiuolo. Botticelli's panel adopts the format and composition of Piero's, but features a more elegant and naturally posed figure and includes an array of \"fanciful enrichments so as to show up Piero's poverty of ornamental invention.\"In 1472 Botticelli took on his first apprentice, the young Filippino Lippi, son of his master. Botticelli and Filippino's works from these years, including many Madonna and Child paintings, are often difficult to distinguish from one another. The two also routinely collaborated, as in the panels from a dismantled pair of cassoni, now divided between the Louvre, the National Gallery of Canada, the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9 in Chantilly and the Galleria Pallavicini in Rome.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_34885", "text": "In 1481, Pope Sixtus IV summoned Botticelli and other prominent Florentine and Umbrian artists to fresco the walls of the newly completed Sistine Chapel.  This large project was to be the main decoration of the chapel.  Most of the frescos remain but are greatly overshadowed and disrupted by Michelangelo's work of the next century, as some of the earlier frescos were destroyed to make room for his paintings. The Florentine contribution is thought to be part of a peace deal between Lorenzo Medici and the papacy.  After Sixtus was implicated in the Pazzi conspiracy hostilities had escalated into excommunication for Lorenzo and other Florentine officials and a small \"Pazzi War\".The iconographic scheme was a pair of cycles, facing each other on the sides of the chapel, of the Life of Christ and the Life of Moses, together suggesting the supremacy of the Papacy.  Botticelli's contribution included three of the original fourteen large scenes: the Temptations of Christ, Youth of Moses and Punishment of the Sons of Corah (or various other titles), as well as several of the imagined portraits of popes in the level above, and paintings of unknown subjects in the lunettes above, where Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling now is.  He may have also done a fourth scene on the end wall opposite the altar, now destroyed. Each painter brought a team of assistants from his workshop, as the space to be covered was considerable; each of the main panels is some 3.5 by 5.7 metres, and the work was done in a few months.\nVasari implies that Botticelli was given overall artistic charge of the project, but modern art historians think it more likely that Pietro Perugino, the first artist to be employed, was given this role, if anyone was. The subjects and many details to be stressed in their execution were no doubt handed to the artists by the Vatican authorities.  The schemes present a complex and coherent programme asserting Papal supremacy, and are more unified in this than in their artistic style, although the artists follow a consistent scale and broad compositional layout, with crowds of figures in the foreground and mainly landscape in the top half of the scene.  Allowing for the painted pilasters that separate each scene, the level of the horizon matches between scenes, and Moses wears the same yellow and green clothes in his scenes.Botticelli differs from his colleagues in imposing a more insistent triptych-like composition, dividing each of his scenes into a main central group with two flanking groups at the sides, showing different incidents. In each the principal figure of Christ or Moses appears several times, seven in the case of the Youth of Moses. The thirty invented portraits of the earliest popes seem to have been mainly Botticelli's responsibility, at least as far as producing the cartoons went. Of those surviving, most scholars agree that ten were designed by Botticelli, and five probably at least partly by him, although all have been damaged and restored.The Punishment of the Sons of Corah contains what was for Botticelli an unusually close, if not exact, copy of a classical work.  This is the rendering in the centre of the north side of the Arch of Constantine in Rome, which he repeated in about 1500 in The Story of Lucretia. If he was apparently not spending his spare time in Rome drawing antiquities, as many artists of his day were very keen to do, he does seem to have painted there an Adoration of the Magi, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. In 1482 he returned to Florence, and apart from his lost frescos for the Medici villa at Spedaletto a year or so later, no further trips away from home are recorded.  He had perhaps been away from July 1481 to, at the latest, May 1482.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_34886", "text": "The masterpieces Primavera (c. 1482) and The Birth of Venus (c. 1485) are not a pair, but are inevitably discussed together; both are in the Uffizi.  They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance.  As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity.  Together with the smaller and less celebrated Venus and Mars and Pallas and the Centaur, they have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations, the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism, and the identity of the commissioners and possible models for the figures.Though all carry differing degrees of complexity in their meanings, they also have an immediate visual appeal that accounts for their enormous popularity.  All show dominant and beautiful female figures in an idyllic world of feeling, with a sexual element. Continuing scholarly attention mainly focuses on the poetry and philosophy of contemporary Renaissance humanists. The works do not illustrate particular texts; rather, each relies upon several texts for its significance. Their beauty was characterized by Vasari as exemplifying \"grace\" and by John Ruskin as possessing linear rhythm.  The pictures feature Botticelli's linear style at its most effective, emphasized by the soft continual contours and pastel colours.The Primavera and the Birth were both seen by Vasari in the mid-16th century at the Villa di Castello, owned from 1477 by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, and until the publication in 1975 of a Medici inventory of 1499, it was assumed that both works were painted specifically for the villa. Recent scholarship suggests otherwise: the Primavera was painted for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's townhouse in Florence, and The Birth of Venus was commissioned by someone else for a different site.\nBotticelli painted only a small number of mythological subjects, but these are now probably his best known works.  A much smaller panel than those discussed before is his Venus and Mars in the National Gallery, London.  This was of a size and shape to suggest that it was a spalliera, a painting made to fitted into either furniture, or more likely in this case, wood panelling.  The wasps buzzing around Mars' head suggest that it may have been painted for a member of his neighbours the Vespucci family, whose name means \"little wasps\" in Italian, and who featured wasps in their coat of arms.  Mars lies asleep, presumably after lovemaking, while Venus watches as infant satyrs play with his military gear, and one tries to rouse him by blowing a conch shell in his ear. The painting was no doubt given to celebrate a marriage, and decorate the bedchamber.Three of these four large mythologies feature Venus, a central figure in Renaissance Neoplatonism, which gave divine love as important a place in its philosophy as did Christianity.  The fourth, Pallas and the Centaur is clearly connected with the Medici by the symbol on Pallas' dress.  The two figures are roughly life-size, and a number of specific personal, political or philosophic interpretations have been proposed to expand on the basic meaning of the submission of passion to reason.A series of panels in the form of an spalliera or cassone were commissioned from Botticelli by Antonio Pucci in 1483 on the occasion of the marriage of his son Giannozzo with Lucrezia Bini. The subject was the story of' Nastagio degli Onesti from the eighth novel of the fifth day of Boccaccio's Decameron, in four panels. The coats of arms of the Medici and the bride and groom's families appear in the third panel.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He published 17 scientific papers during this time mostly around the properties of X-rays from radioactive sources and the measurement of heat generated from radioactive disintegration.  Although none of the papers were in direct collaboration with the Curies, he worked closely with them and it was reported that when Marie Curie visited America years later, she stated that she most wanted to see \"Niagara Falls, The Grand Canyon and William Duane\"Duane refined a technique for extracting radon-222 gas from radium sulfate solutions. Solutions containing 1 gram of radium were \"milked\" to create radon \"seeds\" of about 20 millicuries each.  These \"seeds\" were distributed throughout Paris for use in endocurietherapy. Duane perfected this \"milking\" technique during his time in Paris and referred to the device as a \"radium cow\".He returned to the United States in 1913 and worked in a joint role as assistant professor of physics at Harvard and Research Fellow in Physics of the Harvard Cancer Commission. The Cancer Commission was founded in 1901 and hired Duane to investigate the usage of radium emanations in the treatment of cancer. In 1915 he built Boston's first \"radium cow\" and thousands of patients were treated with the radon-222 generated from it. He published eight papers on the technical details of using radioactive material and X-Rays in the treatment of cancer.

He was fifteen years younger than his brother Louis, a great Latin scholar and lexicographer, who survived him. Although very poor, he was admitted to the College of Sainte-Barbe, where he received a thorough classical education. He showed his gratitude to this establishment by writing its history in three volumes, published between 1860 and 1864. At the end of his studies he hesitated for some time before deciding what career he would follow, until Jules Michelet put an end to his indecision by inspiring him with a taste for history.\nIn 1835 Quicherat entered the \u00c9cole des Chartes; he left two years later at the head of the college. Once more inspired by the example of Michelet, who had just written an admirable work on Joan of Arc, he published the text of the two trials of Joan, adding much contemporary evidence on her heroism in his Proc\u00e8s de condamnation et de r\u00e9habilitation de Jeanne d'Arc (5 vols. 1841-1849), as well as half a volume of Aper\u00e7us nouveaux sur l'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc, in which it seems that the last word has been said on important points.\nFrom the 15th century he drew other inspirations. In 1844 he published memoirs of the adventures of a brigand, Rodrigue de Villandrando, which gradually grew into a volume full of fresh matter. He wrote full biographies of two chroniclers of Louis XI, one very obscure, Jean Castel, the other, Thomas Basin, bishop of Lisieux, who was, on the contrary, a remarkable politician, prelate and chronicler. Between 1855 and 1859 Quicherat published the works of the latter, most of which were now brought out for the first time. In addition to these he wrote Fragments in\u00e9dits de Georges Chastellain and Lettres, m\u00e9moires et autres documents relatifs \u00e0 la guerre du bien public en 1465.\nThese works did not wholly occupy his time: in 1847 he inaugurated a course of archaeological lectures at the \u00c9cole des Chartes, and in 1849 was appointed professor of diplomatics at the same college. His teaching had exceptionally good results. Although he was not eloquent and had a nasal voice, his hearers were loath to miss any of his thoughtful teaching, which was unbiased and well expressed. Of his lectures the public saw only some articles on special subjects which were distributed in a number of reviews. Note should be made of a short treatise on La Formation fran\u00e7aise des anciens noms de lieu published in 1867; and a memoir De l'ogive et de l'architecture ogivale published in 1850, where he gives his theory on the use of stone arches important for the history of religious architecture. In an 1874 article on L'\u00e2ge de la cath\u00e9drale de Laon, he declared an exact date for the birth of Gothic architecture.\nFollowing the advice of his friends, he began to transcribe towards the end of his life his lectures on archaeology; but only the introductory chapters, up to the 11th century, were found among his papers. On the other hand, the pupils trained by him circulated his principles throughout France, recognizing him as the founder of national archaeology. In one point he seems to have taken a false step; with a warmth and pertinacity worthy of a better cause he maintained the identity of Caesar's Alesia with Alaise, and he died without becoming a convert to the opinion, now almost universally accepted, that Alise Sainte-Reine is the place where Vercingetorix capitulated. But even this error benefited science; some well directed excavations at Alaise brought many Roman remains to light, which were subsequently sent to enrich the museum at Besan\u00e7on.\nAfter 1871, his course of lectures on diplomatics having been given up, Quicherat, still professor of archaeology, was nominated director of the Ecole des Chartes. He filled this post with the same energy which he had shown in the many scientific commissions in which he had taken part. In 1878 he gave up his duties as professor, which then fell to the most conspicuous of his pupils, Robert de Lasteyrie. He died suddenly at Paris on April 8, 1882, a short time after having corrected the proofs of Suppl\u00e9ment aux t\u00e9moignages contemporains de Jeanne d'Arc, published in the Revue Historique.\nAfter his death it was decided to bring out his hitherto unpublished papers; among these are some important fragments of his archaeological lectures, but his Histoire de la laine, with which he was occupied for many years, is missing.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_34909", "text": "Proc\u00e8s de condamnation et de r\u00e9habilitation de Jeanne d'Arc, 5 vol., 1841-1849.

He established many championship scoring records, including being the top championship goal-scorer of all time with 59 goals. Rackard is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game.Born in Killane, County Wexford, Rackard was introduced to sport by his father who had hoped he would become a cricketer. His uncle, John Doran, won an All-Ireland medal as a Gaelic footballer with Wexford in 1918 and it was hurling and Gaelic football that Rackard developed a talent for.\nRackard played competitive hurling as a boarder at St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny. Here he won back-to-back Leinster medals in 1938 and 1939, however, an All-Ireland medal remained elusive. By this stage Rackard had started playing for the local Rathnure St. Anne's club, winning a county junior championship medal in 1940. As a member of the club's senior team he won four county senior championship medals.\nRackard made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was selected for the Wexford minor panel. He was just out of the minor grade when he was selected for the Wexford senior team in 1940. Over the course of the next seventeen years, Rackard won two All-Ireland medals as part of the Wexford hurling breakthrough in 1955 and 1956. He also won four Leinster medals, one National Hurling League medal and one Leinster medal as a Gaelic footballer. He played his last game for Wexford in August 1957.\nBy the late 1940s, Rackard was a regular in the full-forward line on the Leinster inter-provincial team. Success came in the twilight of his career and he claimed his sole Railway Cup medal in 1956.\nRackard's brothers, Billy and Bobby, also experienced All-Ireland success with Wexford.In retirement from playing Rackard became involved in team management and coaching. It was with the Wexford senior team that he enjoyed his greatest successes as a selector when, in 1968, he helped the team secure the All-Ireland title.\nRackard was most famous for his scoring prowess and was the all-time top championship scorer at the time of his retirement from hurling. His private life was marred by periods of excessive drinking, which had started during his university studies, and eventually developed into alcoholism. After quitting drinking completely in 1970, Rackard travelled the country as a counsellor with Alcoholics Anonymous. In an interview in the Irish Press in 1975, he detailed his life as a recovering alcoholic and became one of the first sportspeople to break the taboo of alcoholism in Ireland. Rackard's death from cancer in April 1976 saw a huge outpouring of grief amongst the hurling community.

When Wexford celebrated All-Ireland success in 1955 and 1956 Rackard was a teetotaller. During a visit to New York in 1957, however, Rackard began drinking again and the habit grew progressively worse over the next 12 years.

He finally quit by 1970 after joining Alcoholics Anonymous. When Rackard quit drink for the final time he was practically broke. He pieced his life together again, rebuilt his veterinary practice and indulged his passion for horses, enjoying wins in point-to-points and other major race events.\nWith the AA he travelled the country helping people who were troubled by alcohol. In February 1974 Rackard noticed strange lumps on his neck which he had later removed. Later that year he was told he needed another operation and was said to be making good progress.

In 1838 Kuranda went to Stuttgart, where he became acquainted with David Strauss, the author of Das Leben Jesu; with Uhland, and with other Swabian poets. Here, too, for the first time he came into contact with public political life. He then went to Paris and Brussels. In the latter city he attracted attention through lectures on modern German literature. With the assistance of Minister Nothomb and the author Hendrik Conscience he founded in 1841 the periodical Die Grenzboten; but on account of the obstacles which the Prussian government placed in the way of its circulation in Germany, Kuranda removed its headquarters to Leipzig, where it soon became an important factor in Austrian politics.

Kuranda did not remain long in the Frankfort parliament. In the summer of 1848 he returned to Vienna and established the Ostdeutsche Post, which first appeared on 1 October, and in which he strove to oppose the revolutionary element. After the promulgation of the constitution (the Octroirte Verfassung), which had been forced upon the people, Kuranda had to give up his position as editor of the Ostdeutsche Post.

She wrote four well-received cookbooks, two of which were devoted to ice cream and other desserts. Together with her husband Alfred, Marshall operated a variety of different businesses.

Marshall was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes were interred at the Paines Lane Cemetery in Pinner. Alfred remarried within a year of her death to Gertrude Walsh, a former secretary that Marshall had previously fired. The two had likely been engaged in an affair before Marshall's death. Their son Alfred died in 1907 and his ashes were interred next to Marshall's. The elder Alfred died in 1917 in Nice during World War I; his ashes were at his request also interred next to Marshall's in 1920.Marshall was one of the most celebrated cooks of her time and one of the foremost cookery writers of the Victorian age, particularly on ice cream. Her recipes were renowned for their detail, simplicity and accuracy. For her work on ice cream and other frozen desserts, Marshall in her lifetime earned the nickname \"Queen of Ices\". Only a single book on ice cream is known from England before Marshall's work and she helped popularise ice cream at a time when the concept was still novel in England and elsewhere, particularly through the portable ice cream freezer and the ice cream cone. Before Marshall's writings and innovations, ice cream was often sold frozen to metal rods which had to be returned after all had been licked off and was mainly enjoyed by just the upper classes. She increased the popularity of ice cream to such an extent that she was credited for causing an increase in ice imports from Norway. In 1901, she became the first person known to have suggested the use of liquid nitrogen to freeze ice cream (and the first to suggest using liquified gas on food in general). Marshall imagined this would be the ideal method to make ice cream since the ice cream could be created in seconds and the ice crystals resulting from this method would be tiny, as desired.Despite her fame in life, Marshall's reputation declined rapidly after her death and her name faded into obscurity. Her husband continued to operate their businesses but they declined without Marshall's personality and drive. In 1921, the company was sold and became a limited company and in 1954 it ceased operations. Marshall's cookery school remained in operation until the outbreak of World War II. The Table also continued to be published to around the same time. The rights to her books were sold off to the publishing house Ward Lock at some time in 1927 or 1928, though Ward Lock had little interest in keeping them in print. In the 1950s, a fire destroyed much of Marshall's personal papers which further pushed her into obscurity.More recently, from the late 20th century onwards, Marshall's reputation has been restored as one of the most prominent cooks of the Victorian age. The cookery writer Elizabeth David referred to her as the \"famous Mrs Marshall\" in the posthumously published Harvest of the Cold Months (1994) and the author Robin Weir declared her to have been \"the greatest Victorian ice cream maker\" in a 1998 biographical study. Weir assessed Marshall in 2015 as a \"unique one-woman industry\" whose achievements were \"arguably unequalled\" and who \"deserves much more credit than she has been given by history\". Since the late 20th century, Marshall's books have once more been reprinted and ice cream freezers based on her original designs are once again in commercial use. Using liquid nitrogen to freeze ice cream has also become an increasingly popular trend. A liquid nitrogen ice cream store that was inspired by Marshall's proposed technique was opened in 2014 in St. Louis, Missouri and named \"Ices Plain & Fancy\" after her book.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

His mother was a sister of Yi Ga-hwan (\u674e\u5bb6\u7165, 1742\u20131801), one of the Catholics executed with him in 1801.\nYi Seung-hun first came into contact with Catholicism via Yi Byeok in 1779. In 1783\u20134, he accompanied his father on a diplomatic mission to Beijing, China, and on the suggestion of Yi Byeok contacted the Catholic priests there. He was baptised in Beijing in the spring of 1784. This was the first time that a member of the Korean yangban class was formally baptised as a Christian and he returned to Korea with books, crucifixes, and other Catholic artifacts. Yi Byeok then seems to have taken some time to study the books before declaring himself convinced. He then set about evangelizing those around him, including Gwon Cheol-sin and his younger brother Gwon Il-sin. This was also the moment when he spoke of the Catholic faith to the brothers Jeong Yak-jong, Jeong Yak-jeon, and Jeong Yak-Yong (who recorded the event in his epitaph myojimyeong.It was only after Yi Byeok felt fully convinced that he authorized Yi Seung-hun to baptise himself and the other converts to Catholicism. Early in 1785 the growing group of believers and sympathizers in Seoul moved their regular gatherings for worship from the house of Yi Byeok to that belonging to another convert, Kim Beom-u, on the hill where Myeongdong Cathedral now stands. Almost immediately the authorities raided the house, suspecting it of being a gambling den, and were embarrassed on finding it full of nobles. Yi Seung-hun was among those named in the official report of the incident. After the death of Yi Byeok later that year, Yi Seung-hun took over his role in the group. In the spring of 1786, as there were yet no formally ordained priests in Korea, Various leading Korean laymen, including Choi Chang-Hyon, Yi Tan-won, began acting as \"temporary clerics\".

There would be no ordained priest in Korea until 1795, when the Chinese priest Zhu Wenmiao arrived, at which time the Church had grown to over 4000 members. Yi Seung-hun and Jeong Yak-jong were the main leaders of the community in Seoul after the death of Yi Byeok in 1786. Yi Seung-hun's wife was Jeong Yak-jong's sister.\nIn 1801, the Korean Catholic Church was subject to the first major repression by the government (the Sinyu Persecution) in which more than 300 people were killed. Yi was martyred by beheading on the 26th of the 2nd lunar month (April 8), 1801. This incident has come to be known as the Catholic Persecution of 1801. Little written material remains from this period but a collection of texts by several of the first believers, known as Mancheon yugo (\u8513\u5ddd\u907a\u7a3f), was discovered in about 1970.

Though his own designs were largely derivative, Phinney took a great interest in type and its history and throughout his tenure at A.T.F. he sought to preserve and protect that company's legacy, as for instance, when he oversaw the re-introduction of Binny & Ronaldson's 1796 type design, Roman No. 1, as Oxford in 1892, or when he purchased Frederick W. Goudy's first type design, Camelot, in 1896.  He stayed with A.T.F. for the rest of his career, passing the role of design head to Morris Fuller Benton and becoming senior vice-president.

In 2003, Frostenson was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in France in recognition of her services to literature.Frostenson is one of Sweden's foremost poets, whose style unites experimental, traditional and archaic elements with a preoccupation with the materiality of language. She has published over two dozen books, primarily poetry. Debuting in 1978 with I mellan (In-Between), she rose to critical acclaim with her collections in the 1980s and 1990s, including Den andra (The Other, 1982), I det gula (In the Yellow, 1985) and Joner (Ions, 1991), which is often seen as one of the most notable collections of Swedish poetry in the twentieth century.

These limits of language in calling forth reality and experience is also one of the main themes of Katarina Frostenson's work. Her poetry attempts to bring forth experience rather than describe it. In her poetry collections, Frostenson combines shorter poems and longer narrative poems, often with a sense of fragmentation that attempt to convey images or emotions of a specific moment.Along with a group of other Swedish women poets emerging in the 1980s such as Ann J\u00e4derlund and Birgitta Lillpers, Frostenson's work evinces an attempt to communicate outside of a realm dominated by male writers, focusing on sounds and image rather than a united logos and coherent semantics. Frostenson's poetry stands out in Swedish literary history for its radical linguistic experimentation through a blend of the archaic and the avant-garde; its focus on the intricate sonic qualities of the Swedish language; its references to classical mythology, folksongs, ballads, and canonical Western literary and philosophical figures; and its general lack of metaphor and descriptive language. Her work is orientated towards drawing attention to the material elements of language, that is, sounds, while also being attuned to, playing with, and deconstructing the semantic elements formed out of the phonetic building blocks in search of a purer, authentic or genuine kind of language.One could say that Frostenson attempts to eliminate all barriers which disrupt emotional and sensory communication. The experience of language's shortcomings is more authentic than its inability to communicate truth. Rather than relying on metaphors and complex attempts at reproducing in language the complexities of human experience, Frostenson's poetry instead gathers fragments of images, emotions, and sounds. Often, each image or feeling appears with an unexpected opposition, creating a dissonance of meaning. For Frostenson, the human senses are more faithful to experience and thus more trustworthy than language as a means of communication.Frostenson's oeuvre is one of the most influential in Swedish literature. Known first and foremost as a poet, she has published fourteen collections of poetry as well as several works of prose, drama, (creative) nonfiction, translations from French, as well as the libretto for Sven-David Sandstr\u00f6m\u2019s opera Staden (The City, 1998).

His best season was 1958, when he won the overall silver medal in both the European Championships at Eskilstuna and in the World Championships at Helsinki, on both occasions trailing just behind Oleg Goncharenko. It is widely acknowledged that Shilykovsky had to skate the final 10,000 m distance in much less favourable conditions than Goncharenko, and Shilykovsky was seen as the \"moral world champion\" by the spectators and commentators.\nAt the start of the Olympic 1960 season, the world record on the 10,000 m was still the legendary 16:32.6 set in 1952 by Hjalmar Andersen (although Nikolay Shtelbaums had skated 16:31.4 in Chelyabinsk on 4 February 1959, a result not ratified by the International Skating Union (ISU)). On 31 January 1960 at Medeo, both Shtelbaums (16:18.9) and Shilykovsky (16:13.1) skated below Andersen's record time, at the traditional \"Prize of the Soviet Ministry of the Kazakh Republic\" competition; but again these world record times were not officially ratified by the ISU. At the 1960 Winter Olympics four weeks later, first Kjell B\u00e4ckman (16:14.2) and then Knut Johannesen (15:46.6) lowered the official world record, while Shilykovsky only managed a 20th place, skating in unfavourable conditions.\nShilykovsky's personal bests were 42.8 (500 m), 2:15.1 (1,500 m), 8:06.7 (5,000 m), in addition to the 16:13.1 (10,000 m).\nShilykovsky grew up in Vladimir but moved to Moskva for education and for sports. He became Moskva champion in 1955 and finished his master of sports degree the same year. He skated for Shakhter and later on for Spartak. He held a degree in technical sciences (\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a) from 1969, and published scholarly articles in his field.\nShilykovsky was a highly unusual athlete by being able to compete at world top level in spite of a severe handicap; he lost his right arm when he was six months old as the result of an illness. This did not stop him taking part in all normal activities. In addition to his speed skating achievements, he was an accomplished swimmer and cyclist.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Having reached a favourable view of the person of the visionary, the diocese is conducting a review of the theology of Pierina's writings in the light of Catholic teaching.Pierina was born in the municipality of Montichiari which is located in the Brescia province of the Lombardy region in northern Italy. She died there  when she was 79 years old.

Due to its limited household income, the family often moved to various residences in Montichiari.When Pierina was seven years old her father, died, leaving her mother to support the three children. Between 1918 and 1922, Pierina was placed in a Montichiari orphanage, conducted by the sisters of the Handmaids of Charity. This experience had a lasting impact on Pierina. Pierina received her First Holy Communion in the orphanage when she was eight.Pierina returned to her family to assist her mother with the care of her two younger siblings, at the age of 11.  At age 12, her mother (who was now remarried), and eight siblings moved to live in a cottage with her step-family. Pierina claimed she had received inappropriate attention from her step-father. Although not wishing to introduce any discord into these two families that were now living together, Pierina eventually confided everything to her mother. Partly due to that trauma, Pierina decided to consider a vocation in the religious life at age seventeen. Her confessor advised her to wait, in order to further discern any genuine religious calling to the consecrated life.\nDespite all of Pierina's troubles, a soothing glimpse of her caring and devout family upbringing can be observed by this early childhood reminiscence from Pierina's diary: \"I was the first of nine children, I the first to be delighted in the joy, the bliss, and the caresses of my parents. The day of 3 August 1911 was the dawn of my earthly coming, and I was baptized on August 5, the feast of the Madonna of the Snow; on that given day, my Mamma consecrated me to the true Mamma in Heaven, so that her maternal protection would preserve me as white and pure as snow.\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_35278", "text": "At eighteen, Pierina worked as a children's assistant at a communal nursery school in Montichiari.

Her confessor finally spoke concerning her most genuine thoughts, thus confirming her vocation.

He also created pastiches of the work of leading Italian painters of the 16th century.  He designed cartoons for mosaics and worked as an art restorer.  Della Vecchia was also sought after as an art expert and did expert valuations of artworks. He worked most of his life in Venice and its environs except for a brief stay in Rome.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_35306", "text": "The life of Pietro della Vecchia is not very well documented and the information available is not always reliable.  He is believed to have been born in Vicenza in 1603 as the son of Gasparo della Vecchia, who was a painter admitted to the Venetian painters guild.  Some art historians place the artist's place of birth in Venice.  Pietro della Vecchia was erroneously called Pietro Muttoni after Luigi Lanzi in the first edition of his Storia pittorica della Italia (1796), mixed up the artist's name with that of a Muttoni collection, which kept one of his paintings.  Later authors interpreted de la Vecchia (meaning 'of the old') as a nickname as the artist liked to imitate the old masters of the previous century.  Pietro was in fact a scion of a well-known Venetian family called 'Dalla Vecchia'.Early sources describe Alessandro Varotari, called il Padovanino, as his teacher.  On stylistic grounds some art historians have expressed doubt on this traineeship in his early years.  The influence of the works of Padovanino is only visible after 1635.  So he may have worked with Padovanino at a later stage.  His earliest known work show a strong influence by Carlo Saraceni and Saraceni's pupil and collaborator Jean Leclerc.  This is an important indication that della Vecchia trained with them. As his work displayed for some time certain Caravaggesque characteristics it is believed that he spent time in Rome after the departure of Leclerc from Venice in 1621 or 1622.  Della Vecchia probably worked in Padovanino's workshop after his return from Rome in 1625 or 1626.  Padovanino, whose style was strongly rooted in early-16th-century Venetian art, likely played an important role in instilling in della Vecchia a great interest in 16th-century painting in Venice and the Veneto.The first documents in which the name of della Vecchia appears date back to the period from December 1626 to January 1628.  The documents deal with the payment for a banner the artist had made for the Confraternity of the Carmelites in the church of S. Marco in Pordenone. From 1629 to 1640 he was a member of the guild of painters in Venice.  In 1626 he married Clorinda R\u00e9gnier (or Clorinda Renieri), a daughter of the Flemish painter Nicolas R\u00e9gnier (or Renieri). Clorinda R\u00e9gnier was a painter in her own right and has been described as \"a woman of great spirit, of great stature and of great adherence\" (Tommaso Temanza, 1738).  Lucrezia R\u00e9gnier, the elder sister of della Vecchia's wife was married to Daniel van den Dyck, a Flemish painter active in Northern Italy.  Della Vecchia, together with his brother-in-law Daniel van den Dyck and their respective spouses, painted wall decorations in the Palazzo Pesaro in Preganziol.\nTowards the end of the 1630s della Vecchia had established his name as one of the leading painters of Venice, especially of religious works.  In January 1640 the procurators of S. Marco de Supra, responsible for the decoration of St Mark's Basilica, commissioned from him two cartoons for mosaics.  These appear to have been well received as della Vecchia was subsequently appointed Venice's \"pitor ducal\" (painter to the duke), a position he held until 1674, that is, until four years before his death.  In this capacity he was responsible for the design of the new mosaics and the restoration of the old ones in the Basilica.  Della Vecchia also received a commission to restore Giorgione's Castelfranco Madonna altarpiece in 1643-1644.At the height of his career, della Vecchia was a very sought-after teacher with a large workshop employing many assistants.  Della Vecchia also opened an academy in his house where live drawing classes were organised.  Gregorio Lazzarini was one of his pupils probably shortly after 1667.  Gregorio Lazzarini was later the teacher of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.  Della Vecchia also taught classes on the theory of art.Della Vecchia enjoyed fame as a connoisseur of ancient drawings and paintings.  Especially during the latter part of his life he was repeatedly consulted by collectors and merchants, often together with his father-in-law Nicolas R\u00e9gnier. Both he and his father-in-law had business relations with Paolo del Sera, who was the art agent in Venice of Leopoldo de' Medici, an Italian cardinal, scholar, patron of the arts and the Governor of Siena.  Marco Boschini, an engraver, art dealer and author who was a great admirer of della Vecchia, often joined the artist when he was asked to value paintings after 1670.\nDella Vecchia was close to the humanistic and libertine circle around the Accademia degli Incogniti (Academy of the Unknowns), a learned society of freethinking intellectuals, mainly noblemen, that significantly influenced the cultural and political life of mid-17th-century Venice.  Many of the subjects of his works were a reflection of the intellectual occupations of this influential Venetian society.  For instance the charged eroticism in the Young couple is likely linked to the libertine attitudes of the Accademia.His son Gasparo Prospero was born on 8 May 1653 and became a minor painter, musician, music theoretician and mathematician.  Pietro della Vecchia also had four daughters one of whom died young.Della Vecchia died on 8 September 1678 in Venice and was buried in the church of S. Canciano.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_35307", "text": "Della Vecchia was a versatile and prolific painter who worked in many genres and created altarpieces, portraits, genre scenes and grotesques.  He relied on the assistance of a large workshop, which explains his large output as well as the fact that many of his works are known in multiple versions.  He dated his religious paintings but not his other works, which makes it difficult to understand the evolution of the artist in these other genres.During his career the artist worked in a variety of artistic styles and absorbed many influences including from contemporary artists as well as artists from the previous century.  He combined in his work the monumentality of the 16th century Venetian art of artists such as Titian and Tintoretto with the dramatic effects of the style of the Caravaggisti.  In line with the Venetian Baroque his works tend to push the sentiments of the depicted figures to the extreme.  This penchant for exaggeration, even the grotesque, was central to della Vecchia's mature style and was influential on other artists.  The artist developed a unique style, which was characterised by its pursuit of artistic virtuosity, and often depicted subject matter which was unusual and esoteric.  These features explain the high demand for his work by the more discerning Venetian collectors of his time.\nHis earliest known works include two representations of Saint Francis, which display clear Caravaggesque tendencies.  Some paintings of this early period show an affinity with those of an anonymous artist likely of French origin, the so-called Candelight Master, who can perhaps be identified with Trophime Bigot.  It is assumed that during his presumed stay in Rome from 1621/2 to 1626 he may have been in contact with French followers of Caravaggio active in Rome such as Trophime Bigot and Claude Vignon. The first dated work by della Vecchia is the Calvary in the church of San Lio in Venice, and is dated 1633:  It still shows the influence of Carlo Saraceni and Jean Leclerc, his presumed masters.The influence of Bernardo Strozzi becomes noticeable in his work after 1630.  This is apparent in the Angel Offering a Skull to St Giustina, who stands between St Joseph and St John (1640, Accademia, Venice) painted for the church of San Giustina. From 1640 to 1673 he painted designs for some the mosaic depictions inside the St. Mark's Basilica.  A development towards greater drama was visible after 1650.  The works of that time draw again on the Caravaggesque models he followed at the start of his career.  The apex of this evolution is apparent in the two remaining works of the cycle of seven paintings that the artist executed between 1664 and 1674 for the second cloister of the Jesuit church in Venice.  The paintings represent the Conversion of Francis Borgia (Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Brest) and Marco Gussoni in the Ferrara lazaretto (location unknown).  The macabre themes, the effects of spectral lights and the suffocating lack of space in the compositions are unique in Venetian painting of the seventeenth century, comparable only with the morbid paintings of the Milanese or Neapolitan schools. After this cycle his later paintings appear without inspiration and derivative from the painter's earlier works.  Of greater interest are some historical paintings of this period, which show in the bold brushstrokes and the bright and dazzling palette the influence of the leading 17th-century Venetian painter Francesco Maffei, who died in 1660. Other works of his later period show the influence of Giambattista Langetti and the group of tenebrosi active in Venice around 1660.\nDella Vecchia had a notable interest in Venetian masters including Titian and Giorgione. This interest was likely nurtured during a stay as an assistant in the workshop of Padovanino. For his skill in imitating the works of Giorgione, his friend Marco Boschini coined for him the nickname 'simia da Zorzon', meaning 'ape of Giorgione'.  Giorgione was called Zorzon in the Venetian dialect. According to Boschini, della Vecchia abused of his skill in imitating the older Venetian masters.  Boschini recounts that when the art dealer Francesca Fontana was assembling a collection for Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici he was given a 'Giorgione self-portrait'.  This portrait was actually an imitation by della Vecchia painted from his own features.  When the deceit was discovered, della Vecchia claimed he was solely trying to emulate Giorgione and that he had produced the work 30 years earlier for his father-in-law Nicolas R\u00e9gnier.  Nicolas R\u00e9gnier, who  was not only a painter but also an art dealer, had sold the painting.  Thirty years later, it was believed that the work was in fact a genuine Giorgione.  It appears therefore that della Vecchia's imitations could very well be regarded in certain cases as attempts to pass off the imitations as originals.  His friend Boschini regarded these imitations, often executed in a remarkably ingenious manner, as displays of virtuosity. Other artists whose works della Vecchia and his workshop regularly imitated included Titian, Romanino, Palma Vecchio, Paris Bordone and Jacopo Bassano.  His imitations of Giorgione offer an important insight into the manner in which that artist's work was perceived in the 17th century.  It is believed that none of della Vecchia's works in the style of Giorgione were based on now lost compositions of Giorgione but were 'original' creations in the style of Giorgione.Della Vecchia was known for his paintings of soldiers (referred to as 'bravi') with broad feathered hats of which he made many versions and variations.  Some of these paintings depict individual soldiers while others show soldiers in genre scenes such as fortune telling, playing dice etc.  The innumerable repetitions of these works depicting warriors and other popular figures created by his workshop had a negative impact on his posthumous reputation.  Della Vecchia painted not only imaginary portraits of bravos, but also of philosophers, pages and courtesans. These portraits are an expression of the Venetian Baroque's taste for eccentric subject matter.  They also represent the artist's reaction to the expressive head portraits (tronies) by Caravaggio and Rembrandt.\nThere are about eight pictures by della Vecchia in which the landscape is the primary subject. These include four idyllic landscapes that presage the Rococo style (now in the Pinacoteca Querini-Stampalia) and the Rocky Landscape with Warriors in the Hermitage.  Two further landscapes were auctioned at Dorotheum on 20 October 2015 as lot 279.  These latter works are executed in a painterly technique, reminiscent of the 'picturesque' style of late 16th-century artists Titian and Jacopo Bassano. The two compositions likely do not depict a particular story, but are rather an evocation of a romanticised wild countryside, frequented by intrepid warriors wearing fantastic costumes.Della Vecchia maintained close links with the members of the Accademia degli Incogniti.  Their philosophical occupations were reflected in the iconography of some of his paintings of the 1650s and 1660s. In some works he treated the mathematical, philosophical and cabalistic ideas in a serious manner and in others he ridiculed them through salacious images.  For example in the Allegory of architecture (1654, Accademia Carrara di Belle Arti di Bergamo), which depicts a half-naked woman crouched over a book on a ledge with an old man and another half-naked woman seeming to beseech her, he gives expression to some of those ideas.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Simple objects become cultural interfaces. Through them I navigate accord and discord. When trying to unravel complex issues, I am instinctively drawn to things that connect to my personal narrative as a point of departure: a comb or a strand of hair. Charged with agency, simple objects nave the mysterious ability to reflect or absorb us. I find my image, my personal story, in an object. But it is also the object's ability to act as a rhizome, the multiple ways in which it can be discovered or read by a wide audience that draws me in. To sustain my practice, I milk the object, its potential, its image, and its materiality. I manipulate the object in a formal manner to engage the viewer in conversation about collective meaning. If we unravel a cloth together, what do we learn in the process? What is the connection between combs, hair, and textiles? Can a strand of hair tell a life story or a whole cultural history? I trust that my stories, your stories, our stories are held in the object. In this way, the everyday \"thing\" becomes a lens through which we may better see one another.

Such was his passion for antiquities that he is known to have sold his jewels and precious earthenware in order to secure the coveted treasures and have the description of them printed. Borgia placed his scientific collection at the disposal of scholars, regardless of creed and country, and gave them encouragement and support.

Boisselot had already assumed the management of his family business in Marseille and Barcelona, following the death of his brother Louis-Constantin (1809\u20131850), himself a successor to their father Jean-Louis (1782\u20131847), music publisher and musical-instrument manufacturer in Montpellier and Marseille. His achievements brought him many awards at exhibitions, such as one silver medal at the Paris Exposition of 1839, one gold medal at the French Industrial Exposition of 1844 and again at the London Great Exhibition of 1851. The quality of his grand pianos at home granted him a first class medal at the Exposition Universelle (1855), where his products were among the best of France and Spain.\nPoor financial operations and the Barcelona fire of 1855 put the company in difficulty. Boisselot retired that same year and passed the management of his factories over to his nephew, Franz Boisselot (1845\u20131902), whose godfather was Franz Liszt, and who completely restored his business to a prosperous situation, delivering 600 to 800 pianos per year, with a large number destined for export.

He is known for his own political prominence as well as that of his children and was a patriarch of the Kennedy family, which included President John F. Kennedy, Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and longtime Senator Ted Kennedy.\nKennedy was born into a political family in East Boston, Massachusetts. He made a large fortune as a stock and commodity market investor and later rolled over his proceeds by dedicating a substantial amount of his wealth into investment-grade real estate and a wide range of privately controlled businesses across the United States. During World War I, he was an assistant general manager of a Boston area Bethlehem Steel shipyard; through that position, he became acquainted with Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. In the 1920s, Kennedy made huge profits by reorganizing and refinancing several Hollywood studios; several acquisitions were ultimately merged into Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) studios. Kennedy increased his fortune with distribution rights for Scotch whisky. He owned the largest privately owned building in the country, Chicago's Merchandise Mart.\nKennedy was a leading member of the Democratic Party and of the Irish Catholic community. President Roosevelt appointed Kennedy to be the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he led from 1934 to 1935. Kennedy later directed the United States Maritime Commission. Kennedy served as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 to late 1940. With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Kennedy was pessimistic about Britain's ability to survive attacks from Nazi Germany. During the Battle of Britain in November 1940, Kennedy publicly suggested, \"Democracy is finished in England. It may be here [in the United States].\" After a controversy regarding this statement, Kennedy resigned his position.\nKennedy was married to Rose Fitzgerald and had nine children. During his later life, he was heavily involved in the political careers of his sons. Three of Kennedy's sons attained distinguished political positions: John served as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and as the 35th president of the United States, Robert served as the U.S. attorney general and as a U.S. senator from New York, and Ted also served as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_35514", "text": "Joseph Patrick Kennedy Sr. was born on September 6, 1888, at 151 Meridian Street in East Boston, Massachusetts.

Davidson also played bass, percussion, organ, electronic keyboards, and reed instruments.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_35518", "text": "Davidson was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, and began studying piano at age four. When he was twelve, he became the organist at the Zion Temple Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God, where his parents were pastors. He attended the Boston Latin School, graduating in 1959, then enrolled at Harvard College on a full scholarship, studying biochemistry. During this time, he began a long period of experimentation with various kinds of drugs, which may have led to the psychological issues that would later manifest themselves. After six years at Harvard, Davidson was asked to leave, as his academic performance had suffered. He apparently landed on his feet, however; Milford Graves later recalled that by 1965, Davidson was \"with a big laboratory up in Boston, with a big-time guy\".While at Harvard, Davidson became increasingly dedicated to music, and began traveling to New York City to play. During 1964, he met Ornette Coleman, and began playing with him on a regular basis. (Coleman would later refer to Davidson as his favorite pianist.) Davidson also occasionally played drums with the New York Art Quartet, substituting for Milford Graves when he was unavailable, and also played with Paul Motian, among others. (Prior to playing with Motian for the first time, Keith Jarrett heard him on a tape with Davidson; he later stated: \"it completely knocked me out\".)\nAt the recommendation of Coleman, Bernard Stollman, the founder of ESP-Disk, agreed to record Davidson without having heard him play. In July 1965, Davidson recorded his debut album, Lowell Davidson Trio (ESP 1012), featuring five original compositions, with bassist Gary Peacock and Graves on drums. Recorded in one take, it would prove to be Davidson's only commercial recording released during his lifetime.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Davidson collaborated with many musicians in both Boston and New York. He experimented with graphic and proportional notation, and assembled a book consisting of shapes created by a color copier. (Guitarist Joe Morris recalled Davidson pointing to a small part of one of his graphic scores and telling him \"if we practice for six months we might be able to play that\".) Davidson also experimented with scores made from aluminum foil riddled with pin holes and held over a light in order to \"burn the shape of the music into your synapses\".In the late 1980s, Davidson's behavior became increasingly erratic, and he was hospitalized at the psychiatric unit of Boston City Hospital. He later contracted tuberculosis, which went untreated, and died on 31 July 1990 at age 48. Ornette Coleman was among the attendees at his funeral, which was held at his family's church.Joe Morris studied and performed with Davidson and has described the pianist as a major influence. In 1997, Morris released Antennae, an album inspired by some of Davidson's graphic scores, with bassist Nate McBride and drummer Jerome Deupree, on the AUM Fidelity label. In 2009, Morris released MVP LSD: The Graphic Scores of Lowell Skinner Davidson on Riti Records, featuring Morris on guitar, John Voigt on bass, and Tom Plsek on trombone. In 2012, Morris released Graffiti in Two Parts, a recording of a 1985 concert in Cambridge, Massachusetts, featuring Davidson on bass and drums, Morris on guitar, Malcolm Goldstein on violin, and Butch Morris on cornet, on the RogueArt label.2014 saw the release of Rediscovered Session of 1988, on which Davidson appears with vibraphonist/pianist/drummer Richard Poole. Concerning his encounter with Davidson in the studio, Poole recalled: \"Shortly after we began recording, I realized he was multidimensional... he talked constantly and shortly took over the session.

Davidson did not let space dominate the intervals. He let it in judiciously.\"Raul D'Gama Rose wrote: \"Lowell Davidson was one of those quintessential artists. A pianist possessed of great virtuosity, he was also a Harvard-educated biochemist and his musical art\u2014both compositions and performance\u2014and emerged from a confluence of the two. Davidson inhabited a rarified space. He understood and played with such harmonic sophistication that he may be compared in this respect only to Thelonious Monk, Herbie Nichols and Don Pullen. As a scientist-musician he believed that musical tones, if properly employed, could influence the evolution of the brain.\"Joe Morris recalled: \"His music was much more about sound. He used to talk about the upper partials clashing together. It was very slow moving, it was much more about sounds slowly morphing into other sounds... It was... like what you would call electroacoustic improvisation now. His trio music, even though it had bass and drums, moved at a very slow pace. It had a sort of groove, but it was very different. And he operated differently. His rhetoric was very different. I don't think he ever thought of himself as a jazz musician; he just saw himself as a musician. He was a very dignified, incredibly brilliant guy. He would never lower himself to some mere label.\" Morris added: \"He was so brilliant in the way he spoke about things; it was impossible to dismiss it as just crazy talk. Even though at first it sounded like that, over time I understood what he was talking about, and we could have conversations. He used to say it was about evolution, that if we play things we haven't heard before, it will alter the biochemistry of the brain. He said that's what evolution is about... I understand that what he was really trying to do was to move humans forward.\" Regarding Davidson's funeral, Morris stated: \"The music played by the church band circled and rose to the ceiling. The sounds clashed and blended. The partials merged. It sounded like Lowell's music.\"Taylor McLean, a musician who had met Davidson at Harvard, stated that despite Davidson's personal issues, his life was \"positive and victorious.\" He recalled that Davidson lived in an \"alternative universe\" in which he was successful: \"It is a form of success that is little understood, and that brings with it no comforts. The artist is driven to pursue and formulate successive objective forms. That is the only way to cross the river and stay alive in the current. It is a form of achievement and 'success' that is incomprehensible to the normative path because it comes at great personal cost, [does not] include social status, accumulation of material goods, praise and adulation, or even a supportive social network.

Seen by some as \"The Father of Economics\" or \"The Father of Capitalism\", he wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work that treats economics as a comprehensive system and as an academic discipline. Smith refuses to explain the distribution of wealth and power in terms of God's will and instead appeals to natural, political, social, economic, legal, environmental and technological factors and the interactions among them. Among other economic theories, the work introduced Smith's idea of absolute advantage.Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.\nAs a reaction to the common policy of protecting national markets and merchants through minimizing imports and maximizing exports, what came to be known as mercantilism, Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity.

He was well known for having a 4.0 grade point average and earning a degree in just three years in aeronautical engineering, despite the fact that he did not speak English when he first arrived in New York.After college, Juneau spent a year with the Canadian Olympic team while disputing his contract offer from the Bruins. The sticking point was Juneau's insistence on being paid full salary even if he was sent to the minors - a demand Boston refused, having been burned in a nearly identical situation with Wes Walz the previous year.  Then-general manager Harry Sinden was famously quoted in response to Juneau's threat to play in Switzerland instead \"Well, I hope he learns to yodel.\"  In the meantime, Juneau led Canada to a silver medal at the 1992 Albertville Games, and was the tournament's leading scorer.Juneau would eventually sign with Boston on the team's terms, and Sinden's fears proved groundless. Juneau joined the Bruins' NHL roster right after the Olympics, and never spent a day in the minor leagues during his career. He had an impressive nineteen points in fourteen regular season games at the end of the 1992 season before a strong playoff.His best season was his rookie year of 1992\u201393 with the Bruins, when, as the left winger on a powerful line with Adam Oates and Cam Neely, he had 32 goals and 102 points and set the NHL record for assists in a season by a left wing with 70, a mark Juneau held until 2022, when it was passed by Jonathan Huberdeau of the Florida Panthers. As a reward, he was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team.\nLegend has it while with the Bruins, Juneau approached Bruins legend Johnny Bucyk asking if he could wear his No. 9 in Boston. Bucyk responded \"Score 557 goals first, and then come talk to me.\"\nDuring the 1993\u201394 season, the Bruins traded Juneau to the Capitals for Al Iafrate (who played only twelve games for Boston). In 1996, he became the first player ever to be awarded a penalty shot in overtime in a Stanley Cup playoff game (although he failed to score) during the second overtime of the Capitals' four-overtime loss to Pittsburgh. Juneau was also a member of the 1997\u201398 Capitals squad that reached the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals, scoring seventeen points in twenty-one playoff games. He scored the game-winning goal in overtime against the Buffalo Sabres in the 1998 Eastern Conference Finals that sent the Capitals to the Stanley Cup Finals. The next season, 1998\u201399, with the Capitals plagued by injuries and missing the playoffs, Juneau was traded to the Sabres, who reached the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals.Juneau spent the 1999\u20132000 season with the Ottawa Senators, who signed him largely to fill the offensive gap created when Alexei Yashin was suspended for failing to honor his contract.Juneau's offensive numbers steadily declined, largely due to chronic injuries. He became a journeyman, playing for five teams in four seasons before settling with the Montreal Canadiens as a third-liner for the final three seasons of his career. He announced his retirement after the 2003\u201304 NHL season.  Juneau finished with 156 goals and 416 assists for 572 points over thirteen seasons.Juneau wore No. 90 for the majority of his career, and later admitted that his reason for choosing No. 90 was a result of his preferred No. 9 was either retired or worn by different players. The lone exception was during his stint with the Ottawa Senators when he wore No. 39. This was done as then general manager Pierre Gauthier had a policy in place where no player could wear a number higher than the goaltender.

After graduating, he landed a job at General Electric soldering wires.\nTommy Roe first recorded his original song \"Sheila\" in 1960 for Jud Phillips's Judd label. \"I wrote this poem for a girl I had a crush on in high school, and her name was Freda,\" recalled Roe in 2015. \"[Jud Phillips said,] 'Son, I like that song but we gotta do somethin' about that title.' So he sent me home and Aunt Sheila was visiting that weekend. The rest is history!\" The Judd single, misspelled \"Shelia\" and credited to \"Tommy Roe and the Satins,\" is simpler than the more famous hit, with a standard vocal, rhythm combo, and backing chorus. It was a regional hit but did not chart nationally.\nRoe re-recorded the song for ABC-Paramount in 1962, with a new hook: an insistent drum paradiddle modeled on the 1957 hit \"Peggy Sue.\" Roe's slight Southern accent and his interpolation of a hiccup in the vocal invited comparisons with Buddy Holly.\nThis was deliberate, according to Roe: \"Felton (producer Felton Jarvis) said, 'We're gonna do it different. You know there's a vacuum left of Buddy Holly. There are still a lot of Buddy Holly fans out there so we need to draw attention to you, so I'm gonna put Buddy Holly drums on \"Sheila.\"' I wasn't really crazy about that whole idea because I was a big fan of Buddy Holly's and I felt like we were sponging off of him and his whole sound.\"  The new arrangement of \"Sheila\" became a Billboard number 1 hit in the U.S. and Australia in 1962. A buildup of global sales of \"Sheila\" meant that the Recording Industry Association of America did not present the gold record until 1969. When \"Sheila\" became a hit in 1962, ABC-Paramount asked him to go on tour to promote the hit. He was reluctant to give up his secure job at GE until ABC-Paramount advanced him $5,000.However, in March 1963, the UK music magazine NME reported that he and Chris Montez had both been upstaged by the Beatles and their fans on a 21-day UK tour.  Late that year, Roe scored a Top 10 hit with \"Everybody\", which reached US number 3 and UK number 9, and \"The Folk Singer\" (number 4 UK) written by Merle Kilgore was also popular.\nFollowing a more successful tour of the United Kingdom by his friend Roy Orbison, Roe toured there and then moved to England where he lived for several years. In 1964, Roe recorded a song written by Buzz Cason entitled \"Diane From Manchester Square\", about a girl who worked at EMI House when it was based in London's Manchester Square. Sales of this single in the UK were poor, and it failed to chart. During the 1960s, he had several more Top 40 hits, including 1966's number 8 \"Sweet Pea\" (number 1 Canada) and number 6 \"Hooray for Hazel\" (number 2 Canada).In 1969, his song \"Dizzy\" went to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, number 1 in Canada, as well as number 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. This transatlantic chart-topper sold two million copies by mid-April 1969, giving him his third gold disc award.Roe guest-starred in an episode of the American sitcom Green Acres, titled \"The Four of Spades\", airing on November 8, 1969.\nHis final Top 10 single, a track co-written with Freddy Weller, titled \"Jam Up and Jelly Tight\", became his fourth gold record, peaking at number 8 in the U.S. and number 5 in Canada in 1970.Although his style of music declined in popularity with the 1970s mass market, Roe maintained a following and continued to perform at a variety of concert venues, sometimes with 1960s nostalgia rock and rollers such as Freddy Cannon and Bobby Vee. He recorded numerous singles in the late 1970s and 1980s aimed at the country music market. In 1986, Roe was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.\nRoe's autobiography, originally published in 2016, named From Cabbagetown to Tinseltown and places in between, was co-written with Michael Robert Krikorian.On February 7, 2018, Roe officially announced his retirement on his Facebook page with this statement: \n\nToday I am announcing my retirement.

Commencing in April 1809, Archer remained under Beazley's instruction for the duration of his three-year term of articles before moving on to the office of John Rennie the Elder in April 1813 in the position of drawing clerk. Archer's employment with Rennie was terminated in 1818, he returned to Ireland and worked as an engineer for over 8 years, building his reputation. Following his father's death in 1822 and the ongoing strain of the economic depression of the time, Archer sought to find employment elsewhere. His opportunity came in December 1826 when John Rennie's son recommended Archer for the position of Colonial Architect in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) as the need arose for the development of public buildings and offices to accommodate the growing convict and free-settler population of Van Diemen's Land.Upon arrival in Hobart Town on 2 August 1827, Archer immediately commenced work in the role of Civil Engineer and Architect for the colony. Alongside the high demand for prisons and other buildings of a convict nature, the rise in free settlers due to the ongoing depression called for the development of other public works to accommodate the needs of colonial life, such as police offices, public offices, military barracks and churches. For the majority of the 11 years that John Lee Archer served as Civil Engineer and Colonial Architect, he was responsible for all government commissioned buildings, many still notable today.\nArcher married Sophia Mattinson of Hobart on 3 September 1833 and the pair established a home in New Town with their many children. Due to a temporary decline in colonial revenue Archer was retrenched in 1838 and was never reinstated in his role. As others moved in to take over his responsibilities in his absence, Archer became isolated from his profession at the age of 47 with little hope of local employment opportunities.\nIn October of the same year Archer moved to north-west Tasmania and took the position of police magistrate for the district of Horton.  He stayed with this role for the remainder of his life. In 1843 he produced a map of Stanley, reproduced by Betty Jones in Along the terrace: the owners and occupiers of Stanley 1843 -1922.John Lee Archer died at the age of 61 on 4 December 1852, and is buried at Circular Head.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Henry's eldest brother, King Frederick the Great, insisted that his brother marry, of course equally, just as their father had once arranged Frederick's marriage against his will. He only left him the choice of which of the sisters from the House of Hesse he wanted.Wilhelmina was described as a charming beauty. Wilhelmina and Henry had their own court and lived at Schloss Rheinsberg and Berlin. Wilhelmina had no children with Henry, who was reported to pay more attention to his male friends than to her. At his marriage Henry described the situation to his siblings that he was \"changing from the captivity of the king to the captivity of marriage\". Although the whole court spied on her behavior, she always managed to appear in a good mood and not to offer court gossip a target thanks to her consistently friendly demeanor.The couple separated in 1766 after an alleged affair on Wilhelmina's side. After the separation, she lived at Prince Henry's Palais in Berlin, on the grand boulevard Unter den Linden, which the king had built for his brother between 1748 and 1753 (today the main building of the Humboldt University of Berlin). She occupied one half of the building while her husband lived in the other.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nShe was popular with her husband's family, especially his brothers, while her husband was more distant towards her. Nevertheless, the Duke of Nevers wrote about Henry: \"He shows more consideration for his wife than his brother.\" (What was meant was the behavior of the king to his wife Queen Elisabeth Christine.)\n\nThe Swedish princess Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp described her at the time of her visit in 1798: She was a tall and handsome lady with a well kept figure, though very thin, and you can still see how remarkably beautiful she was in her youth. Her eyes are big and lively though somewhat protruding, and with a restless look. She is witty and literal, but as a consequence of her age, she sometimes talks of several subjects at the same time. Her manners are regal, and she represents perfectly, and was additionally very polite and toward me very pleasant. \nShe was one of the few members of the royal house to remain in Berlin during the French occupation in 1806. While most of the royal family left, reportedly because of the anti-Napoleonic criticisms they had expressed, and the members of the royal court either followed them or left the capital for their country estates, Wilhelmina remained with Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia and his consort Margravine Elisabeth Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt because of \"their high age\" as well as Princess Augusta of Prussia, who was pregnant at the time.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

But reviewers soon noticed key differences between Finch's poetry and that of other new formalist poets. Henry Taylor, for example, claimed that Finch was not a typical new formalist because she did not focus on the realities of contemporary life, and C.L.

Her first anthology A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women (1993) collected poems and essays by contemporary women poets. The \"metrical code,\" the central theory of her book of literary criticism The Ghost of Meter (1994), is cited in the article on \"feminist poetics\" by Elaine Showalter in the Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics.

By 1935, he helped establish a Franco-American cultural center in New York City to promote bilateral relations. The center was aimed at students and businessmen.When the Second World War broke out, Chambrun served as a captain, but with the collapse of France looming by mid-May 1940, French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud sent Chambrun as a special emissary to Washington to stiffen President Roosevelt's resolve to help the Allies. Between his first meeting with Roosevelt on 16 June and his last on 1 August, Reynaud's government had fallen. Later that year, Chambrun published the book I Saw France Fall, which helped to alert American opinion about the fate of his country.\n\nAfter the Liberation of France and the consequent fall of Laval's collaborationist government, Chambrun was a defender of Laval: Father-in-law wants a big trial which will illuminate everything, if he is given time to prepare his defence, if he is allowed to speak, to call witnesses and to obtain from abroad the information and documents which he needs, he will confound his accusers.\nThe Chambruns threw themselves into the task of assisting Laval in his defense before the High Court of Justice. After Laval's sentence and execution in October 1945, Chambrun was put on police watch in Paris on the suspicion that he may have helped the Nazis during the war. In 1942, Chambrun had been named on a list of French collaborators with Germany to be killed during the war or tried after it. By 1947, Chambrun officially applied for a US passport.Meanwhile, Chambrun and his wife devoted their energies over the following decades to the cause of his rehabilitation in the eyes of history. For example, he wrote a letter to President Dwight Eisenhower in which he objected to his characterisation of Laval as \"Hitler's most evil puppet\" in his 1948 memoir entitled Crusade in Europe. Chambrun based his argument on another book, authored by Spanish Foreign Minister Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er, in which the latter quoted Hitler describing Laval as \"no better than De Gaulle.\" By 1949, Eisenhower agreed to remove the passage from subsequent reprints. A decade later, in 1959, his wife wrote the foreword of Tout ce qu'on vous a cache, a book based on \"German secret files\" authored by Jacques Baraduc, Laval's lawyer. The book attempted to show that Laval \"refused repeatedly to yield to German demands for a reduction in the number of United States agents in French North Africa and a limitation on their activity.\"In 1969, Chambrun made an appearance in Marcel Oph\u00fcls's documentary on collaboration between the Vichy government and Nazi Germany during World War II, The Sorrow and the Pity (Le chagrin et la piti\u00e9). Chambrun wrote three books on the subject between 1983 and 1990. The Chambruns set up a foundation, the Jos\u00e9e and Ren\u00e9 de Chambrun Foundation, which collected documents on Laval for publication by the Hoover Institution. After Laval's death, the Chambruns brought flowers to his grave every 15 October to commemorate the day that he was executed.After World War II, Chambrun was hired by Peter II of Yugoslavia when the latter filed for divorce in 1953; the couple reconciled two years later. He represented the fashion designer Coco Chanel when she sued manufacturer Pierre Wertheimer to regain the marketing rights to her perfume, Chanel No. 5. Wertheimer settled the case, and Chanel became a millionaire as a result. In 1970 Chambrun defended Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos over false allegations that he killed his ex-wife, Eugenia Livanos.

News of his discovery brought many historians to his door, but Chambrun denied access, except to Andr\u00e9 Maurois whom he authorized to write a biography of Adrienne de Lafayette. Chambrun produced a book by using the documents that he had discovered; they covered the period of 1792\u20131797, when Lafayette was in an Austrian prison.

A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist and political philosopher who made contributions to economics, political philosophy, psychology, intellectual history, and other fields. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for work on money and economic fluctuations, and the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena. His account of how prices communicate information is widely regarded as an important contribution to economics that led to him receiving the prize.During his teenage years, Hayek fought in World War I. He later said this experience, coupled with his desire to help avoid the mistakes that led to the war, drew him into economics. He earned doctoral degrees in law in 1921 and political science in 1923 from the University of Vienna. He subsequently lived and worked in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany. He became a British citizen in 1938. His academic life was mostly spent at the London School of Economics, later at the University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg. He is widely considered a major contributor to the Austrian School of Economics.Hayek had considerable influence on a variety of political movements of the 20th century, and his ideas continue to influence thinkers from a variety of political backgrounds today. Although sometimes described as a conservative, Hayek himself was uncomfortable with this label and preferred to be thought of as a classical liberal. As the co-founder of the Mont Pelerin Society he contributed to the revival of classical liberalism in the post-war era. His most popular work, The Road to Serfdom, has been republished many times over the eight decades since its original publication.Hayek was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1984 for his academic contributions to economics. He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush. In 2011, his article \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the American Economic Review during its first 100 years.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_35947", "text": "Hayek's influence on the development of economics is widely acknowledged. With regard to the popularity of his Nobel acceptance lecture, Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after Kenneth Arrow) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics. Hayek wrote critically there of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical modelisation. A number of Nobel Laureates in economics, such as Vernon Smith and Herbert A. Simon, recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist. Another Nobel winner, Paul Samuelson, believed that Hayek was worthy of his award, but nevertheless claimed that \"there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last half of the twentieth century economist fraternity. In 1931, Hayek's Prices and Production had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927\u20131931 (and the 1931\u20132007) historical scene\". Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to have been right and his own teacher Joseph Schumpeter to have been wrong on the central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy.Hayek is widely recognised for having introduced the time dimension to the equilibrium construction and for his key role in helping inspire the fields of growth theory, information economics and the theory of spontaneous order. The \"informal\" economics presented in Milton Friedman's massively influential popular work Free to Choose (1980) is explicitly Hayekian in its account of the price system as a system for transmitting and co-ordinating knowledge. This can be explained by the fact that Friedman taught Hayek's famous paper \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" (1945) in his graduate seminars.\nIn 1944, he was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy after he was nominated for membership by Keynes.Harvard economist and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers explains Hayek's place in modern economics: \"What's the single most important thing to learn from an economics course today? What I tried to leave my students with is the view that the invisible hand is more powerful than the [un]hidden hand. Things will happen in well-organized efforts without direction, controls, plans. That's the consensus among economists. That's the Hayek legacy\".By 1947, Hayek was an organiser of the Mont Pelerin Society, a group of classical liberals who sought to oppose socialism. Hayek was also instrumental in the founding of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the right-wing libertarian and free-market think tank that inspired Thatcherism. He was in addition a member of the conservative and libertarian Philadelphia Society.Hayek had a long-standing and close friendship with philosopher of science Karl Popper, who was also from Vienna. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated: \"I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps Alfred Tarski\". Popper dedicated his Conjectures and Refutations to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, to Popper and in 1982 said that \"ever since his Logik der Forschung first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology\". Popper also participated in the inaugural meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society. Their friendship and mutual admiration do not change the fact that there are important differences between their ideas.\nHayek also played a central role in Milton Friedman's intellectual development. Friedman wrote: My interest in public policy and political philosophy was rather casual before I joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. Informal discussions with colleagues and friends stimulated a greater interest, which was reinforced by Friedrich Hayek's powerful book The Road to Serfdom, by my attendance at the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, and by discussions with Hayek after he joined the university faculty in 1950. In addition, Hayek attracted an exceptionally able group of students who were dedicated to a libertarian ideology. They started a student publication, The New Individualist Review, which was the outstanding libertarian journal of opinion for some years. I served as an adviser to the journal and published a number of articles in it....\nWhile Friedman often mentioned Hayek as an important influence, Hayek rarely mentioned Friedman. He deeply disagreed with Chicago School methodology, quantitative and macroeconomic focus, and claimed that Friedman's Essays in Positive Economics was as dangerous a book as Keynes' General Theory. Friedman also claimed that despite some Popperian influence Hayek always retained basic Misesian praxeological view which he found \"utterly nonsensical\". He also noted that he admired Hayek only for his political works and disagreed with his technical economics; he called Prices and Production a \"very flawed book\" and The Pure Theory of Capital \"unreadable\".  There were occasional tensions at the Mont Pelerin meetings between the Hayek's and Friedman's followers that sometimes threatened to split the Society. Although they worked at the same university and shared political beliefs, Hayek and Friedman rarely collaborated professionally and were not close friends.Hayek's greatest intellectual debt was to Carl Menger, who pioneered an approach to social explanation similar to that developed in Britain by Bernard Mandeville and the Scottish moral philosophers in the Scottish Enlightenment. He had a wide-reaching influence on contemporary economics, politics, philosophy, sociology, psychology and anthropology. For example, Hayek's discussion in The Road to Serfdom (1944) about truth, falsehood and the use of language influenced some later opponents of postmodernism.\nSome radical libertarians had a negative view of Hayek and his milder form of liberalism. Ayn Rand disliked him, seeing him as a conservative and compromiser. In a letter to Rose Wilder Lane in 1946 she wrote:Now to your question: 'Do those almost with us do more harm than 100% enemies?' I don't think this can be answered with a flat 'yes' or 'no,' because the 'almost' is such a wide term. There is one general rule to observe: those who are with us, but merely do not go far enough are the ones who may do us some good. Those who agree with us in some respects, yet preach contradictory ideas at the same time, are definitely more harmful than 100% enemies. As an example of the kind of 'almost' I would tolerate, I'd name Ludwig von Mises. As an example of our most pernicious enemy, I would name Hayek. That one is real poison.\nHayek made no known written references to Rand.Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales was influenced by Hayek's ideas on spontaneous order and the Austrian School of economics, after being exposed to these ideas by Austrian economist and Mises Institute Senior Fellow Mark Thornton.In the 21st century, some libertarian political scientists argue that Hayek would be in favor of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies due to its resistance to political pressure and due to Hayek's emphasis of sound money and competition in currencies. They also argue that cryptocurrency and Bitcoin serve as a \"Hayekian Escape,\" a method that the people can use to escape the government's currency monopoly.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_35948", "text": "In August 1926, Hayek married Helen Berta Maria von Fritsch (1901\u20131960), a secretary at the civil service office where he worked. They had two children together. Upon the close of World War II, Hayek restarted a relationship with an old girlfriend, who had married since they first met, but kept it secret until 1948. Hayek and Fritsch divorced in July 1950 and he married his cousin Helene Bitterlich (1900\u20131996) just a few weeks later, after moving to Arkansas to take advantage of permissive divorce laws. His wife and children were offered settlement and compensation for accepting a divorce. The divorce caused some scandal at LSE, where certain academics refused to have anything to do with Hayek. In a 1978 interview to explain his actions, Hayek stated that he was unhappy in his first marriage and as his wife would not grant him a divorce he had taken steps to obtain one unilaterally.For a time after his divorce, Hayek rarely visited his children, but kept up more regular contact with them in his older years after moving to Europe. Hayek's son, Laurence Hayek (1934\u20132004) was a distinguished microbiologist. His daughter Christine was an entomologist at the British Museum of Natural History, and she cared for him during his last years, when he had declining health.Hayek had a lifelong interest in biology and was also concerned with ecology and environmental protection. After being awarded his Nobel Prize, he offered his name to be used for endorsements by World Wildlife Fund, National Audubon Society, and the National Trust, a British conservationist organisation. Evolutionary biology was simply one of his interests in natural sciences. Hayek also had an interest in epistemology, which he often applied to his own thinking, as a social scientist. He held that methodological differences in the social sciences and in natural sciences were key to understanding why incompetent policies are often allowed.Hayek was brought up in a non-religious setting and decided from age 15 that he was an agnostic.He died in 1992 in Freiburg, Germany, where he had lived since leaving Chicago in 1961.

Previous research, including work by Ambros and Horvitz, had revealed that a gene known as lin-4 was important for normal larval development of C. elegans, a nematode often studied as a model organism. Specifically, lin-4 was responsible for the progressive repression of the protein LIN-14 during larval development of the worm; mutant worms deficient in lin-4 function had persistently high levels of LIN-14 and displayed developmental timing defects. However, the mechanism for control of LIN-14 remained unknown.\nAmbros and colleagues found that lin-4, unexpectedly, did not encode a regulatory protein. Instead, it gave rise to some small RNA molecules, 22 and 61 nucleotides in length, which Ambros called lin-4S (short) and lin-4L (long). Sequence analysis showed that lin-4S was part of lin-4L: lin-4L was predicted to form a stem-loop structure, with lin-4S contained in one of the arms, the 5' arm. Furthermore, Ambros, together with Gary Ruvkun (Harvard), discovered that lin-4S was partially complementary to several sequences in the 3' untranslated region of the messenger RNA encoding the LIN-14 protein. Ambros and colleagues hypothesized that lin-4 could regulate LIN-14 through binding of lin-4S to these sequences in the lin-14 transcript in a type of antisense RNA mechanism.\nIn 2000, another C. elegans small RNA regulatory molecule, let-7, was characterized by the Ruvkun lab  and found to be conserved in many species, including vertebrates. These discoveries confirmed that Ambros had in fact discovered a class of small RNAs with conserved functions. These molecules are now known as microRNA.

But by the time he reached adulthood during the post-war boom, Detroit was a thriving center of culture as well as the auto industry. He remained in Detroit, enrolling at Wayne State University. An outstanding student, Meisner was admitted to a graduate program there after only two years of college.\nHowever this was also the beginning of the Cold War and the Red Scare in the U.S., having serious repercussions on the personal lives of Maurice Meisner and his  wife Lorraine. As part of the McCarthy era investigations, Lorraine was subpoenaed before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1952 in relation to her attendance at the World Festival of Youth and Students held in East Berlin the previous year. Like most witnesses called before hearings of HUAC or the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS), Lorraine Meisner refused to testify to the body. Although this assertion of her Fifth Amendment rights had no direct legal consequences, David Henry, president of Wayne State University where she was also a student, saw fit to expel her from the university. Although seen as an unusually harsh move even at the time, other schools were reluctant to admit a student dismissed under such circumstances.\nThe Meisners moved to Chicago after they had been accepted to study at the University of Chicago, where they both would eventually receive doctorates. Maurice Meisner undertook to study Chinese history at a time when this would be considered an obscure choice, but where the emerging significance of China might be discerned in the wake of the 1949 revolution and role of China in the Korean War. This included studying the Chinese language to do research and travel in order to collaborate with the rather few China scholars of the time.\nMeisner's doctoral dissertation was prepared under the Sovietologist Leonard Haimson and developed in further year of research at the East Asian Research Center at Harvard. It was later published by Harvard University Press. In it, Meisner studied the original contributions to Chinese revolutionary theory by the co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Dazhao to show that the adaptation of Marxism to China which had been attributed to Mao Zedong had actually been accomplished by Li.Maurice Meisner was an early member of the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars (CCAS). In addition to opposing American participation in the Vietnam War, the group also involved itself in demystifying China at a time in which \"Red China\" was regularly portrayed as a threat to America, arguably surpassing the Soviet Union as a target of anti-communist sentiment toward the end of the 1960s.

His story is related in the anonymous 6th-century Georgian hagiographic novel The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta.\nOne of the earliest extant works of the Georgian literature, The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta (\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10e2\u10f3\u10da\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0\u10f2 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10db\u10dd\u10d7\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0\u10f2 \u10ec\u10db\u10d8\u10d3\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0 \u10d4\u10d5\u10e1\u10e2\u10d0\u10d7\u10d8 \u10db\u10ea\u10ee\u10d4\u10d7\u10d4\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0\u10f2) was written by an anonymous author later in the 6th century, within thirty years of Eustathius' reported death. The morphology of the work as well as some theological phrases also supports this dating, although the earliest surviving manuscript dates from c. 1000 (Georgian National Center of Manuscripts, MSS H-341). The text is also interesting for the first Georgian formulation of the Ten Commandments, an account of the life of Jesus which recalls Tatian's Diatessaron (a Gospel harmony of the 2nd century), and traces of influence of the 2nd century Apology of Aristides. The Passion was first published by Mikhail Sabinin in 1882.Eustathius is reported by the hagiographer to have been an Iranian cobbler originally called Gvirobandak, son of a high-ranking Zoroastrian priest (magi), from Ganzak. Having converted to Christianity, he flees persecution to Georgia (Iberia), then under the Iranian military authority, in 541. He settles at the Christian town of Mtskheta and marries a Christian woman. The local Iranian cobblers\u2019 guild denounces Eustathius to the marzban Arvand Gushnasp with seven other converts to be judged. Arvand punishes the apostates by having their noses pierced and casts them in prison under sentence of death. Six months later, Arvand releases them, however, as a farewell gesture to the local people, when recalled from Georgia by the king Khosrau I. Four years later, under the new marzban Vezhan Buzmihr, Eustathius is rearrested, but reaffirms his faith before the court in a speech of some 3,000 words that makes up nearly half the Passion. Eventually, the marzban, albeit reluctant, has him beheaded in Tbilisi. The remains of Eustathius were taken to Mtskheta and buried at its principal church.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He reported that the district near Portland Bay had good possibilities, and after revisiting it with his father, it was decided that the land was suitable for settlement. Edward went first on the Thistle with labourers, stock, potatoes and seed. After a voyage of 34 days the Thistle arrived at Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 at 8 a.m. Edward Henty told the anecdote,\n\"I stuck a plough into the ground, struck a she-oak root, and broke the point ; cleaned my gun, shot a kangaroo, mended the bellows, blew the forge fire, straightened the plough, and turned the first sod in Victoria\"\nThe second vessel brought Mr. Francis Henty, who landed on 11 December and in course of time Mr. Stephen and Mr. Thomas followed. Sheep were fetched across from Tasmania, pastures occupied, houses erected and land cultivated. The Henty brothers also engaged on bay whaling at Portland in the 1830s. The whale oil and baleen taken from southern right whales was shipped to Tasmania for export to London.\nThe British government had been keen to have land taken up in Western Australia and the Hentys had assumed no objections would be raised to their obtaining land in the Port Phillip district. The application was first made in 1834 and negotiations continued for many years. The father, Thomas Henty, died in 1839, and it was not until 1846 that the matter was finally settled, when the Hentys were allowed \u00a3348 for improvements at the port, and were granted 155 acres (0.63 km2) of land valued at \u00a31290. The remainder of their land they had to buy at auction. The attitude of the government at Sydney to new settlers may be illustrated by an extract from a dispatch of the governor, Sir George Gipps, to Lord John Russell, dated 11 April 1840. \"The Messrs Henty, like the first settlers at Port Phillip, claim to have rendered good service to the government and to the colony of New South Wales by opening a district of country, which might otherwise have remained unoccupied for a number of years; but, so far from considering this any advantage, I look upon it as directly the reverse, not only because the dispersion of our population is increased by it, but because also we are forced prematurely to incur considerable expense in the formation of new establishments. I have already, in consequence of the proceedings of the Messrs Henty, been obliged to send two expeditions to Portland Bay, and I am now under the necessity of organizing a police force there, and of laying out a town, besides incurring expense for the protection of the aborigines.\" The thought that the many thousands of pounds spent by the Hentys in developing the country might eventually be of benefit to the state had apparently not entered into the minds of the authorities. Neither could they have anticipated that the first sale of crown lands which took place a few months later would yield the sum of \u00a317,245.\nEdward Henty was determined to continue with his settlement; his brother, Francis, had joined him in December 1834, and during the next five years other members of the family joined him, and gradually all of their horses, cattle and sheep were transferred from Tasmania. On 29 August 1836 the exploring party headed by Major Thomas Livingstone Mitchell reached Portland Bay and were amazed to find the country already colonised. In later years Edward Henty was fond of telling the story of Major Mitchell when he came to a hut, from which blows of a hammer rang, saying, \"Where is Mr Henty, my man,\" and the reply of the burly blacksmith, \"Here he is at your service.\" From Major Mitchell Henty learned the character of the land to the north, and gradually he was able to acquire more land. In 1845 he had over 70,000 acres (280 km\u00b2). Sometimes the price of wool and sheep fell very low and it was impossible to sell either to advantage; but over the years the stations prospered.\nIn 1855 Edward Henty was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Normanby and was re-elected in 1859. He was defeated in 1861 and did not sit again in parliament. Henty's last years were spent in retirement at his Melbourne mansion 'Offington' and he died on 14 August 1878. In October 1840 he married Annie Maria Gallie who survived him. They had no children.\nEdward Henty in addition to being the first permanent settler in Victoria was the founder of the wool industry in that colony.

The cycle, completed in 1833, gave visual expression to Ludwig's alliance with Italy, and raised the genre of landscape painting to the height of history painting, the preferred mode of the King's other great commissions for monumental painting. The frescos unfortunately deteriorated under climatic influences. The cartoons for them are in the Darmstadt Gallery.\nIn 1834 Rottmann traveled to Greece to prepare for a commission from Ludwig for a second cycle; one might mark here the beginning of his third period. At first also intended for the Hofgarten arcade, the 23 great landscapes were eventually installed in the newly built Neue Pinakothek where they were given their own hall.\nOf his easel pictures, Ammer Lake and Marathon are in the National Gallery, Berlin; The Acropolis of Sikyon and Corfu in the Pinakothek, Munich; others in the Schack Gallery, Munich, and in Karlsruhe; and seven in the Leipzig Museum.\nCarl Rottmann died on 7 July 1850 in Munich, aged 53 of undisclosed causes. He is buried in the Alter S\u00fcdfriedhof in Munich.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is the Interim Executive Director of the Cultural Space Agency, having most recently served for 9 years as the Cultural Space Liaison for the City of Seattle. He is also well known as the founder of Consolidated Works, a contemporary arts center in Seattle.\nRichter has been producing alternative contemporary art, performance, film and music since his graduation from Northwestern University in 1990. In 1992, he formed the seminal Rm 608, a gallery for visual and performing arts, in an abandoned storefront on Seattle's Capitol Hill. The \"small but influential\" (The Stranger) organization served as the launching point for local talents such as David Schmader, the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players, Kia Sian, and Kristen Kosmas, and over the course of its two-year lifespan presented over 200 world-premiere works of theater and performance art, several of which received continued runs off-Broadway in New York City. On its closing in 1994 (the organization's lifespan was built into its structure, and the closing was anticipated) Richter was quoted in The Seattle Weekly as saying, \"Organizations should end, in the same way that performances end, so that the audience can clap, go home, and think about what it meant.\"\nIn 1994, he was hired as the Theater Editor of The Stranger, the alternative newsweekly in Seattle. While there, he expanded his interest in writing and published investigative journalism (according to the paper's website, one undercover report earned him personal bodyguard protection following death threats made by the group investigated) and feature-length articles that were reprinted in alternative newsweeklies around the country. He was also published in an American Heritage college geography textbook.  He left the newspaper in 1997 but continues to publish sporadically, most recently writing on the issue of nonprofit reform in America.\nIn 1998, he formed Consolidated Works, a contemporary arts center in Seattle, housed in a renovated 32,000-square-foot (3,000 m2) warehouse in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood. Art in America called ConWorks (as it was known for short) \"the most dazzling\" alternative arts space in the Northwest. Over the course of seven years as its executive director, he grew the organization into one of the region's most prestigious arts presenters, working with teams of curators and producers to fill the facility's theater, cinema, visual art gallery, music hall, lecture stage, and bar. The center flourished, reportedly thanks to Richter's \"legendary fundraising skills\" and \"internationally renowned programming\" (Seattle Post-Intelligencer).\nIn 2002 he was one of twelve individuals invited under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation to contribute as founding members of the National Arts and Technology Network. In 2003 he received the Seattle Mayor's Arts Award on behalf of ConWorks, and also in 2003 was one of 12 recipients nationally of the Safeco Insurance Rudy Award for leadership in the nonprofit sector. A profile of the Seattle arts scene in Art in America referred to Richter as \"an arts visionary.\" A profile in The Stranger referred to him as \"freakishly ambitious.\"", "hasanswer": true}]}

They played a short set as Adultery, borrowing backline from the Smiths. (Noko also played a set with Pete Shelley at the same gig in a line-up that also included ex-Magazine drummer John Doyle).\nThe line-up for that Adultery show was: Howard Devoto \u2013 vocals, Noko \u2013 lead guitar/viola, Leroy James \u2013 keyboards/2nd guitar, Pete Kinski \u2013 bass, Simon Hoare \u2013 drums.

(There is a bootleg recording of the gig in circulation).\nWhen Luxuria folded in 1990, Noko got together with school friends, brothers Trevor Gray and Howard Gray, and James Gardner and formed Apollo 440.\nThe band released a number of singles and EPs on their own StealthSonic Recordings label: \"Lolita\" (1990), \"Destiny\" (1991), \"Blackout\" (1992) and \"Lolita/Destiny '92\" (1992).\nApollo 440 made four albums: Millennium Fever (1995), ElectroGlide In Blue (1997), Gettin' High On Your Own Supply (1999), and Dude Descending A Staircase (2003) on Sony Records.

Raw Chimp played their live debut that same year at the Download Festival.\nNoko also scored  \u00c9ric Valette's next movie, The Prey which was released in France in April 2011 with worldwide distribution to follow later in 2012. Another French-language thriller, it was written by Laurent Turner and the movie's producer Luc Bossi, The Prey stars Albert Dupontel, Alice Taglioni, St\u00e9phane Debac and Sergi Lopez.\nIt's a dark high-octane edgy chase movie starting in a prison and culminating in a tense mountain denouement. The score is essential orchestral with touches of electronica and a multitude of Noko's trademark guitar-textures.\nThe soundtrack CD is again available on Milan Musique.\nMagazine completed their No Thyself LP at the end of 2011, the first new material from the band since 1981's Magic, Murder and the Weather, which was released on the Wire-Sound label. The band toured the UK in November.

Noko played bass guitar on \"Sons Of Sorrow\" and \"Barrel Of My Own Gun\" and vocals on \"Barrel of my own Gun\" and \"New Chemical\".\nWhen Hotei later signed to Universal's Spinefarm imprint, this LP was repackaged with some extra tracks for release outside of Japan as Strangers (SPINE663762) and included a re-worked version of \"New Chemical\" titled \"Move It\", featuring a lead vocal by Richard Z. Kruspe from Rammstein.\nIt was at Noko's suggestion that Hotei approached Iggy Pop to sing two other tracks on the album, which became \"How The Cookie Crumbles\" and \"Walking Through The Night\".\nHotei and Noko have been friends since 1997, first meeting when Apollo 440 remixed one of Hotei's tracks.

Apollo performed the two tracks live onstage with JMJ in front of the Eiffel Tower to an audience of over 600,000. It was Bastille Day and only two days before, France had won the World Cup. Immediately after they won on 12th, the Mayor of Paris asked Jarre to put together this impromptu free concert for the people of Paris to extend the euphoria. At the climax of the show, an enormous firework display went off on the Eiffel tower behind the stage.\nThis was the largest concert Noko has ever played.

He was educated at Blackburn Grammar School and in 1895 he obtained a scholarship for Jesus College, Oxford to study mathematics. While at Oxford, Garstang became interested in archaeology and conducted excavations at Ribchester. Encouraged to take up archaeology, Garstang excavated other Romano-British sites during his vacations from Oxford.After gaining a 3rd from Oxford in 1899, Garstang joined the team of Flinders Petrie at Abydos. He excavated various sites in the vicinity, including the discovery of the great tombs at Beit Khallaf in 1901. In 1902 he carried out his first independent excavation in Egypt at Reqaqnah. The excavation was funded by an excavation committee, a group of wealthy donors who in turn would receive a selection of objects from Garstang's excavations in exchange for their patronage. Like Petrie before him, Garstang would continue to use Excavation Committees to fund his excavations for most of his career.In 1902, Garstang was also appointed the honorary reader in Egyptian archaeology at the University of Liverpool. In 1904, Garstang founded the Institute of Archaeology, which was affiliated with the university. Largely funded by private benefactors, the Institute contained both a library and a museum, intended to support the work of the staff and the teaching of its students. In 2004, this museum was officially renamed the Garstang Museum of Archaeology, to celebrate the centenary of the foundation of the Institute.From 1907\u201341, Garstang was the first professorship in the methods and practice of archaeology at the university. On behalf of the institute, Garstang excavated sites in Egypt, Sudan and the Near East up to the out break of World War I. Some of his assistant excavators include E. Harold Jones, English artist and illustrator.\nHe served as the Director of the Department of Antiquities in the British Mandate of Palestine between 1920\u201326, and excavated at Ashkelon, 1920\u201321. He was also the Head of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, 1919\u201326. He also carried out a major excavation of Jericho from 1930\u201336, funded by Sir Charles Marston.He taught at the Egyptology section of the Faculty of Arts when this was established in the 1920s. One of his students was Pahor Labib, late Director of the Coptic Museum, Cairo.From 1936 to the outbreak of World War II, Garstang excavated Y\u00fcm\u00fck Tepe near Mersin. Garstang returned to Turkey after the War, and finished the excavation in 1948.

Involved in activism for over 20 years, Abbas has been active in mobilizing worker support during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 and its aftermath.  His approach emphasizes peaceful strikes and rallies accompanied by demands for better wages and working conditions, as well as more regular elections for union officials, and an independent union system.\nHe began his work by organizing a strike at a steel plant in Helwan, Egypt in 1989, for which he was arrested, tortured, and fired.  That incident led to his starting the CTUWS and advocating for workers' rights throughout Egypt.

They were met by 10,000 riot police who fired rubber bullets and tear gas at the striking workers; ultimately the strike was broken up when security forces stormed the plant, resulting on one death, one hundred injuries and hundreds of arrests.Abbas was arrested four times in the subsequent months, including 45 days of detention in which he was tortured.

Abbas saw the incidents as a test of the future of privatisation.  He said, \"People can now see that there is a choice, that they can say no.\"In 1999 he spoke out on the need for education and training for workers.  He said, \"In Korea, development was based on a comprehensive educational policy. We still do not see this happening here. Even in the new factories, production lines are imported with a foreign expert to run them. They are assembly plants and the Egyptian worker does not have to be very skilled. The Egyptian worker does not gain the kind of knowledge that can make him an interactive part of the production process.\"In the 2000 Parliamentary elections, Abbas nominated himself as an independent labor representative for Helwan. Abbas said that his General Union for Mineral, Electrical, and Engineering Industries at first refused to grant him status as a labor representative. According to Abbas, he received it, \"Following a long and exhausting struggle with the general union council.\" He also criticized the candidacy of Minister Sayed Mash'al and supported Safir Nigm for minister of military production in the Helwan area.  Abbas argued, \"After Mash'al took over, there was a massive explosion at one of the factories. Five workers died and compensation was inadequate. When workers complained, [Mash'al] had dozens of them sent to jail.\"In 2001 Abbas commented on the increasing privatisation of employment and the role of professional committees. He said, \"Approximately 50 per cent of the number of trade union members who make up the current trade union structure belong to and vote for 'professional committees.'\" Drivers in the Helwan district, Abbas said, are members of a professional committee, as are the construction workers in Shubra. \"These are committees that have few functions. For example, a driver will only go to his union when getting his licence because he needs their signature. We cannot consider these committees or their members active components of the trade union structure or the working class.\" He noted the changing nature of political alliances regarding unions:  \"And this time around, the left has changed its election programme from calling for the protection of the public sector to focusing on the protection of workers' rights, irrespective of who the management is.\"In 2002 a Unified Labour Law came up for parliamentary debate to replace labour law 137, passed in 1981. Abbas criticized exclusions in the bill which left out government administration, domestic work, workers' families, short-term workers (less than six months), principal management, and self-employed workers, and \"pure\" agricultural work when done by women and minors.In 2003 Abbas began seeking formal registration in line with Article 11 of Law 84/2002, which deals with NGO registration, security and public order.  Abbas was critical of the registration procedures:  \"The law is bad and it is designed to co-opt you under government control.  And there has been heavy government pressure.  But we decided to try and open negotiations with them.  After all, in Egypt you never know what is going to happen\u2014things could get even worse tomorrow.\" Abbas fought attempts to exclude the words \"worker\" and \"trade union\" from the organization name or scope.  \"They wanted us to change our name, but we won't, it's internationally recognized.  They said the name breaches Article 11.  We said no, Article 11 has to do with your goals...They said that our work could breach article 11. 'Your problem is that you speak for workers in disputes, and this we can not allow.  There are government agencies and organizations that already do this, and you cannot have face to face meetings [on these issues].'\"In 2005 Abbas was critical of how workers' rights were being addressed in the political dialogue.  He said, \"Unfortunately, the labour movement's democratic demands are absent from the agenda of change called for by the opposition. Even the political parties that are close to workers' circles\u2014such as the Tagammu and Nasserist parties\u2014are only interested now in the laws that regulate political participation and professional syndicates.\"  He told the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, \"Political movements that once upheld the interests of the working class based themselves on public sector workers, most of whom have been liquidated through early retirement schemes...the current environment where workers see people taking on the state and putting up a fight has created a situation in which we can see renewed labour activism of the sort now taking place...I do not think that such a movement would have been possible if it were not for the current movement for political reform.\"In 2005 Abbas criticized the negotiations in the Esco workers' protest. He noted that clause 69 of the labor contract, which stipulated workers could be fired if they fail to perform \"essential duties\", was broad enough to permit random firings. Abbas also criticized requirements that protests be approved by the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU).  He said, \"Workers go on strike to improve their material conditions.  They are not staging a play. They are not rehearsing for some media circus. And they should not be forced to strike within the straitjacket of a preset timetable. This defeats the purpose of the strike because it limits the workers' bargaining power.\"In June 2005 Abbas commented on legal issues dealing with the Al-Amrya Weaving and Textile Company.  He said, \"The distinction between public and private sector workers will in any case become irrelevant, sooner or later, given that the entire public sector is on the block. What is important in this case is that the Unified Labour Law (12) of 2003 doesn't differentiate between private and public sector workers. Misr Al-Amrya cannot legally argue on the basis of state workers' rights to base salary increments versus private sector workers' non-rights. Which is why, in the end, the company did eventually comply.\"In July 2005 Abbas was attacked by plain-clothes Egyptian security forces while demonstrating against human rights abuses by the Mubarak regime.  He was badly wounded.In 2005 Abbas also criticized the Muslim Brotherhood for being two-faced in their approach to civil rights. \"Egypt has never had democracy. For now the Brotherhood stands for civil rights, but its basic stance is against them. It has one language for the media and another for its followers.\"In November 2006 Abbas dismissed the significance of General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) elections, arguing that public sector industrial workers overseen by the GFTU were increasingly few.  He recommended switching focus to ununionized private sector workers:  \"The minister of investment has openly stated that except for four companies the little that remains of the industrial public sector is for sale...the real battle is to fight for trade union pluralism, to build a new and independent trade union structure.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_36093", "text": "In November 2007 Abass criticized the government sale of companies to international investors, arguing the transactions led to workers losing their jobs.In 2007 he criticized the state of politics, calling the regime illegitimate, and saying that Egypt is \"a suffering society with no way to express itself.\" He speculated that poverty in Cairo could lead to a violent confrontation with the police. Abbas envisioned a charismatic opposition leader who could rise up amidst the tension, but he did not believe such an individual would be part of the labor movement.  He said, \"Those who think the labor movement will lead to political change in Egypt are foolish.  The movement is still too young. We have to be concerned with the economic conditions of the workers. We can't rush things.\"In April 2007 Abbas' CTUWS office was shut down and he was accused of working with \"external forces\" in order to disrupt the country's economy.  The government closed CTUWS' Helwan headquarters and two other branches in Nag' Hamadi and Mehala Al-Kobra for \"security reasons\".In September 2007 Abbas and another writer were convicted of defamation and public abuse after writer Mohamed Helmy published an article on corruption at the 15th of May Youth Center, where Abbas was a member of the board. The story was published in Kalam Sanay'iya, a magazine published by the CTUWS.  The lawsuit for alleged \"slander and defamation of character\" against Abbas\u2014and his co-defendant lawyer Mohamed Helmi\u2014was filed by Mohamed Mustafa Ibrahim, chairman of the board of directors at the youth center. Ibrahim filed three petitions against Abbas and claimed that the magazine article \"publicly defamed him as a state-appointed civil servant\". He based his case on Article 188 of the Egyptian code of law, which penalizes false reporting (anyone who \"publishes false news, statements or rumours likely to disturb public order\" may face a prison sentence).  Abbas was sentenced to one year in prison.About the incident, Abbas commented to National Public Radio, \"The government is also very sensitive about any links between political powers in Egypt and the labor movement because this would mean that workers might enter with their weight into the democratic movement. They're very scared of this.\"\"It is clear the judge's decision to give me a one-year jail sentence is political...It is no coincidence that I was sentenced at about the same time as the journalists and editors,\" Abbas told Ahram Weekly. \"The court had regularly adjourned the case since May, deciding to issue a ruling only on 21 September. Prosecuting and sentencing journalists for publishing offences is all part of the government's general crack-down on civil liberties.  The government feels threatened by the strikes, especially actions taken by the militant Mehala Al-Kubra textile workers whose latest strike was settled last week. They need a scapegoat for their failed policies. This is why they closed down our offices, refuse to license us and continue to accuse the CTUWS of inciting the strikes. The allegations are flattering but untrue. How could we possibly have incited the tens of thousands of workers who have gone on strike since December?\" he said.CTUWS criticized the conviction. \"What does it mean when courts seek to imprison citizens, who publish the facts about corruption cases? The allegations against Ibrahim were found to be true and were the basis for the legal decision... Does it mean that the courts are offering immunity to corrupt officials, that they are offering protection against any criticism or disclosure?\"International labor and human rights groups came out in support of Abbas and condemned the court decision. The International Confederation of Trade Unions (ITUC), accused the Mubarak regime of going after opposition groups and media.  \"We are very concerned about this latest attack on the CTUWS.  We are particularly concerned that these prison sentences follow a long tradition of repression of the CTUWS, an independent civil society organization committed to defending trade union and workers rights in Egypt,\" said Guy Ryder, ITUC general secretary. A coalition of the Italian trade unions sent a letter to Mubarak asking him to \"ensure that CTUWS is not persecuted and demanding that \"this particular case could be reviewed.  The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network also issued a statement \"expressing its deep concern over the case.Egyptian labour historian Joel Beinin said, \"The attack on CTUWS is part of the intensification of the assault of the Mubarak regime against its opponents\". Faiza Rady considered the prison sentence an attack on the defence of workers' rights.After Abbas' and Helmy's September conviction, an investigation by the Governor of Cairo found the charges of corruption at the youth center to be true.  Cairo Governor Abdel Azim Wazir ordered the entire board of the center to be disbanded.Abbas appealed his conviction at a 29 Dec. hearing.  He and Helmy remained free between the case and the appeal.In 2009 Human Rights Watch noted a significant increase \"in the harassment of human rights activists at Cairo airport\", which included the detainment of Abbas.In 2010 the Egyptian Minister of Planning created a committee regarding minimum wage, which Abbas criticized for not acting.  Abbas supported working with the new committee's goals, which included a minimum annual salary increase of seven per cent. He also criticized the labour complaints committee for not meeting regularly.In 2010 Abbas criticized proposals to postpone trade union elections.  Abbas criticized the role of the ETUF as \"a governmental institution, not a federation of genuine trade unions. Nor does it represent Egypt's workers in any way.\" Abbas also noted the practice of elected officials busing in members of their constituency to vote.In May 2010 Abbas criticized the forced end of a protest in Cairo by workers from Amonsito, the Egyptian Telephone Company and el-Nubaria Agricultural Engineering, who had been protesting for several months.  Abbas had said he would submit a complaint to the International Labour Organization about the incident.In August 2010 Abbas criticized the constitutionality of military courts being used on civilians working in military production facilities.Also in August Abbas criticized ETUF head Megawer of being an appointed labor representative in positions that are mandated to be elected.  Abbas also criticized Megawer's affiliation with the National Democratic Party (NDP), suggesting that the ETUF should not be determining eligibility for parliamentary elections.  Abbas argued, \"The ETUF has actually granted a number of businessmen and retired officers, from the ruling party, the status of labor representatives when they are not laborers in any way shape or form.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_36094", "text": "During the revolution, Abbas made an appeal for new trade unions at Tahrir Square.  He said, \u201cOn January 30th we met with representative of other independent trade union organizations and we discussed forming a new federation.  We then made an announcement in Tahrir square, calling for a new federation. But at the time we had no idea what would happen. Since then this call has been responded to by the workers. The challenge now that the revolution has succeeded is to be able to build a society of social justice.\u201dIn February 2011 Abbas criticized the elections in federation syndicates for being corrupt with fraud.  He said, \"There are 116 verdicts of administrative court annulling the last union elections and we believe members of the federation were involved in acts of violence against the protesters in Tahrir\".  Abbas recommended creating independent syndicates, saying, \"We will do as our grandfathers did before 1952 when the first unions were created in Egypt\".Also in February, Abbas supported strikes motivated by \"how many billions the Mubarak family was worth.\"In May 2011 Abbas celebrated International Workers' Day (also known as \"May Day\"), the international socialist commemoration of workers' rights reform begun in the United States.  Abbas deemed that year's celebrations  \"historic\" for marking a break from the ETUF.  Abbas also praised the then newly formed Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (EITUF).  May Day celebrations focused on the free will of Egyptian workers to form independent trade unions, free from state control, and the dismantling of the ETUF.In June 2011, Abbas was co-filer of a lawsuit calling for the dissolution of the state-controlled ETUF.  The suit called for \"sequestration of the ETUF headquarters, buildings, its Workers' University, cultural institute, hospitals and clinics\" as well as \"barring the ETUF from representing Egypt's workers or unions at international conferences\".Abbas interrupted the ETUF's Ismail Fahmy during his speech at the International Labour Organization (ILO) June 2011 conference.  Abbas criticized the ETUF saying, \"Enough ... all these years ... and crimes enough! ... Enough you killers! ... You participated in the passage of the privatization deals, and facilitated and justified the blatant attacks on the rights of workers ... You defended with impunity Mubarak's regime with its corruption, repression and tyranny, and then you plotted against the killing of the revolutionaries in Tahrir Square!\"During the 2011 revolution Abbas made a video from Tahrir Square telling American workers who were on strike in Wisconsin:\n\n\"From this place, I want you to know that we stand with you as you stood with us.  I want you to know that no power can challenge the will of the people when they believe in their rights.  When they raise their voices loud and clear and struggle against exploitation.  No one believed that our revolution could succeed against the strongest dictatorship in the region.  But in 18 days the revolution achieved the victory of the people\u2026.We want you to know that we stand on your side.  Stand firm and don\u2019t waiver.  Don\u2019t give up on your rights.  Victory always belongs to the people who stand firm and demand their just rights.  We and all the people of the world stand on your side and give you our full support.  As our just struggle for freedom, democracy and justice succeeded, your struggle will succeed.  Victory belongs to you when you stand firm and remain steadfast in demanding your just rights.\"\nIn March 2011, Abbas participated in a labour panel discussing the future of trade unions following the fall of Mubarak's regime.  At the end of the panel, Abbas declared, \"the regime has fallen...the Egyptian Federation of Trade Unions has fallen!  What more do you want?  Go create your own unions!\"On 29 February 2012, the CTUWS reported that Abbas had been sentenced in absentia to six months in prison for \"insulting\" a public official.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1753 he began to import and hang flock wallpapers from England. At that time, wallpaper was becoming popular among the bourgeoisie as a creative and economical way to decorate interior spaces. During the Seven Years' War Reveillon started to produce wallpaper himself, marrying well and using his wife's dowry to produce velvet paper, pasted up into rolls and using vibrant colours, developed by Jean-Baptiste Pillement.\n\nIn 1759 he moved to the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, then a neighbourhood dominated by the various crafts associated with furnishing. R\u00e9veillon launched production of a full range of wallpapers. The nobility began to patronize his business and in 1765\u2014--already extremely wealthy--\u2014he bought a mansion, with a parc and a theatre inside La Folie Titon, formerly owned by \u00c9vrard Titon du Tillet. Reveillon installed his wallpaper factory on the ground floor, retaining the upper floors for his private residence.\nIn 1775 R\u00e9veillon opened a paper mill to improve both the quantity and quality of his paper supply. In 1776 he opened a shop near the Tuileries. The papier bleu d'Angleterre became very popular when Queen Marie Antoinette decorated her apartments with them. R\u00e9veillon himself dabbled in chemistry enough to discover a new process for making vellum paper in 1782. The following year he was granted permission to use the title of Manufacture Royale.\nHis purchase of the paper mill and expertise in paper production brought him into contact with Etienne de Montgolfier, and it was from R\u00e9veillon's garden at Folie Titon that the first hot-air balloon was launched on 12 September 1783. R\u00e9veillon delivered a special and colourful wallpaper, used as a cover for the balloon. A second balloon, called Le R\u00e9veillon, with a rooster, a duck and a sheep was launched a week later at Versailles. On 19 October his employee Andr\u00e9 Giroud de Villette and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier went into the sky, as pioneers of flight.\n\nIn the year 1789 R\u00e9veillon was the casualty of his own reflections on modern economics. \"Since bread was the foundation of our national economy,\" he stated in an essay, \"its distribution should be deregulated, permitting lower prices. That in turn would allow lower wage costs, lower manufacturing prices and brisk consumption.\" This musing was misinterpreted by an already angry Parisian populace, who believed that Monseigneur Reveillon was advocating a lowering in wages. On 28 April 1789 his mansion was attacked and looted by an angry mob, all the wallpaper, glue, furniture and paintings were burned. His wine cellar, containing 2,000 bottles of wine, was pillaged and quickly consumed by the riotous mob. R\u00e9veillon and his family escaped by climbing a wall and fleeing to the nearby Bastille. It was a bloody day, some say 25 people dying in the ensuing melee. The rioters were eventually dispersed in an opening episode of the French Revolution. Today plaques mark the site of the Reveillon riot.\n\nR\u00e9veillon emigrated to England with his fortune intact, and after the French Revolution, leased his manufacture to Jacquemart & B\u00e9rnard, who continued to produce wallpaper till 1840.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The band was originally titled H\u00fctz and the B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3ks, but Eugene H\u00fctz says that they decided to change the name because \"nobody knows who the hell B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k is in the United States.\" The band played their first show as the unofficial band at an after-hours club called Pizdetz where they became the house band and DJ H\u00fctz became the house DJ.Gogol Bordello's first single was released in 1999, and since then they have released six full-length albums, and one EP. In 2005 the band signed to punk label SideOneDummy Records. On 27 April 2010 Gogol Bordello made its major record label debut with Transcontinental Hustle on Rick Rubin's American Recordings, a subsidiary of Columbia Records/Sony Music Entertainment. Many of the songs on Transcontinental Hustle were inspired by H\u00fctz's move to Brazil.The band has toured extensively throughout Europe and America. They have made numerous appearances at international festivals and have toured with such diverse bands as Primus, Flogging Molly, and Cake. In an interview with NPR, frontman Eugene H\u00fctz cites Jimi Hendrix and Parliament-Funkadelic as among the band's main musical influences.

Gogol Bordello announced a benefit concert shortly after which sold out quickly, followed by announcing a benefit tour.

His house band was known as The Dynamites.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "19_36183", "text": "Son of a tailor and builder, Eccles spent his childhood in the countryside of the parish of Saint Mary. Eccles had an itinerant childhood due to his father's need to travel Jamaica seeking work. He used to regularly attend church, and he became influenced by spiritual singing; In his words: \"One of my uncles was a spiritual revivalist, who always did this heavy type of spiritual singing, and I got to love that\". Eccles's professional singing career began as a teenager, working the north-coast hotel circuit in the mid-1950s.  In his late teens, he moved to Ocho Rios, where he performed at night in various shows, with artists such as The Blues Busters, Higgs & Wilson and Buster Brown. He moved to Kingston in 1959, where he started his recording career. He first recorded for Coxsone Dodd, who had organised a talent show in which Eccles took part.Eccles had a Jamaican hit in 1961 with the early ska song \"Freedom\", which was recorded in 1959, and was featured on Dodd's sound system for two years before it was released. It was one of the first Jamaican songs with socially oriented lyrics. The song discussed the concept of repatriation to Africa, an idea developed by the growing Rastafari movement. The song became the first Jamaican hit to be used for political purposes; Alexander Bustamante, founder of the Jamaican Labour Party and at that time Chief Minister of Jamaica adopted it for his fight against the Federation of the West Indies in 1960. In the following years, Eccles had other successful songs, mixing boogie/rhythm and blues influences with ska rhythms, such as \"River Jordan\" and \"Glory Hallelujah\".\nIn 1962, he started promoting concerts and set up his Christmas Morning talent show; first with Dodd, then on his own. He organised concerts for The Clarendonians in 1963, and for The Wailers in 1964 and 1965. He launched other talent search contests, with Battle of the Stars, Clancy Eccles Revue, Independent Revue and Reggae Soul Revue, from which emerged stars such as Barrington Levy and Culture.\nStarting in 1963, he recorded with producers such as Charlie Moo (Leslie Kong's business partner) and the husband of Sonia Pottinger, Lyndon. He couldn't make a living from his music, so he quit in 1965 to work as a tailor in Annotto Bay. During this period, he made stage outfits for musicians such as Kes Chin, The Mighty Vikings, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, Carlos Malcolm and The Blues Busters.He went back to music in 1967, producing his own recordings as well as those of other artists. He scored a hit with Eric 'Monty' Morris' reggae song \"Say What You're Saying\", and with his own song \"Feel The Rhythm\", one of several records that were instrumental in the shift from rocksteady to reggae. Eccles has also been credited with deriving the name 'reggae' from streggae', Kingston slang for a good-time girl. Eccles' first hit, \"What Will Your Mama Say\" which was released by the recently created United Kingdom label, Pama Records. In 1968, his song \"Fattie Fattie\" became a skinhead reggae classic, along with his productions of recordings by the toasting DJ King Stitt (\"Fire Corner\", \"Van Cleef\", \"Herbman Shuffle\"). Eccles recorded many organ-led instrumentals with his session band The Dynamites (same band has Derrick Harriott's Crystalites), featuring Jackie Jackson, Hux Brown, Paul Douglas, Winston Wright, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Grennan, Joe Isaacs, and Hugh Malcolm, with Johnny Moore and Bobby Ellis both contributing trumpet in different sessions. In 1970, Eccles helped pave the way to the dub music genre by releasing an instrumental version of \"Herbman Shuffle\" called \"Phantom\", with a mix focusing on the bass line.\nEccles launched different record labels for his works: Clansone, New Beat and Clandisc (the latter also the name of a sub-label set up by Trojan Records for Eccles' UK releases). He recorded artists such as Alton Ellis, Joe Higgs, the Trinidian Lord Creator (\"Kingston Town\"), Larry Marshall, Hemsley Morris, Earl Lawrence, The Beltones, Glen Ricks, Cynthia Richards, Buster Brown and Beres Hammond. Appreciated by musicians for his fairness and sense of equity, he helped Lee Perry set up his Upsetter record label in 1968 after Perry left Dodd's employment, and helped Winston 'Niney' Holmes (later known as 'The Observer') record his first hit as a producer in 1971 (\"Blood & Fire\").A socialist militant, Eccles was appointed as an adviser on the music industry to Michael Manley's People's National Party (PNP) and took part in Jamaica's 1972 prime ministerial elections by organising a \"Bandwagon\" featuring musicians such as Bob Marley & the Wailers, Dennis Brown, Max Romeo, Delroy Wilson and Inner Circle, performing around the island in support of Manley's campaign. Throughout the 1970s, he remained close to Manley and wrote several songs in praise of the PNP program, including his hits \"Power for the People\", \"Rod of Correction\" or \"Generation Belly\".\nEccles' political interests meant that he spent less time on music, although in the late 1970s, Eccles had further success as a producer with recordings by Tito Simon and Exuma the Obeah Man, as well as collaborations with King Tubby. After the 1970s, new Eccles recordings were rare, and he concentrated on live concert promotion and re-issues of his back catalogue. In the 1980s, Eccles slowed down his musical activities, and he never met success again, apart from a few political songs, such as \"Dem Mash Up The Country\" in 1985. Eccles died on 30 June 2005, in Spanish Town Hospital from complications of a heart attack.\nEccles' son, Clancy Eccles Jr., has followed his father into the music business, initially performing as simply \"Clancy\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Following the suppression of the United Irish uprising in 1798, he sought to organise a renewed attempt to overthrow the British Crown and Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland, and to establish a nationally representative government. Emmet entertained, but ultimately abandoned, hopes of immediate French assistance and of coordination with radical militants in Great Britain. In Ireland, many of the surviving veterans of '98 hesitated to lend their support, and his rising in Dublin in 1803 proved abortive.\nEmmet\u2019s Proclamation of the Provisional Government to the People of Ireland, his Speech from the Dock, and his \"sacrificial\" end on the gallows inspired later generations of Irish republicans.

He was the youngest son of Dr Robert Emmet (1729\u20131802), physician to the Lord Lieutenant, and his wife, Elizabeth Mason (1739\u20131803). The Emmets were financially comfortable, members of the Protestant Ascendancy with a house at St Stephen's Green and a country residence near Milltown.\nDr. Emmet supported the cause of American independence and was a well-known figure on the fringes of the Irish patriot movement. Theobald Wolfe Tone, a friend of Emmet's elder brother, Thomas Addis Emmet, and an advocate of more radical reform, including Catholic Emancipation, was a visitor to the house. So too, as a friend of his father, was Dr William Drennan, the original proposer of the \"benevolent conspiracy--a plot for the people\" that was to call itself, at Tone's suggestion, the Society of United Irishmen.\nEmmet entered Trinity College Dublin in October 1793 as a precocious fifteen-year-old and excelled as a student of history and chemistry. In December 1797 he joined the College Historical Society. His brother Thomas and Wolfe Tone, preceding him in the society, had maintained its lively tradition (stretching back to Edmund Burke) of defying the College's injunction against discussing questions of \"modern politics\".Fellow Society member Thomas Moore recalled that men \"of advanced standing and reputation for oratory, came to attend our debates, expressly for the purpose of answering [Robert] Emmet\". His eloquence was unmatched.  In the preface to his Irish Melodies (1837), he recounts Emmet \"ardently\" taking the side of Democracy in the debate \"Whether an Aristocracy or a Democracy is most favourable to the advancement of science and literature?\"  and, in \"another of his remarkable speeches\", saying, \"When a people, advancing rapidly in knowledge and power, perceive at last how far their government is lagging behind them, what then, I ask, is to be done in such a case? What, but to pull the government up to the people?\"Robert Emmet is described by his contemporaries as slight in person; his features were regular, his forehead high, his eyes bright and full of expression, his nose sharp, thin, and straight, the lower part of his face slightly pock-marked, his complexion sallow.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_36190", "text": "While Emmet hid in Rathfarnham, yeomen sought to extract information from Anne Devlin, prodding her with bayonets and half hanging her until she passed out. Had he not insisted on taking his leave of his fianc\u00e9e Sarah Curran (daughter of the disapproving John Philpot Curran) he may have succeeded in joining Dowdall and Byrne in France. Emmet was captured on 25 August and taken to the Castle, then removed to Kilmainham. Vigorous but ineffectual efforts were made to procure his escape.Emmet was tried and convicted for high treason on 19 September. The evidence against him had been overwhelming, but the Crown took the extra precaution of suborning his defence attorney, Leonard McNally, for \u00a3200 and a pension. McNally's assistant Peter Burrowes could not be bought and represented Emmet as best he could.Emmet's instruction, however, was not to offer a defence: he would not call any witnesses, \"or to take up the time of the court\". When on announcing this, McNally proposed that the trial was concluded, the prosecuting counsel William Plunket took to his feet. In what was widely regarded as an unnecessary attack on a doomed man, Plunket, who was to see himself appointed Solicitor-General, mocked Emmet as the deluded leader of a conspiracy encompassing \"the bricklayer, the old clothes man, the hodman and the hostler\".Emmet's Speech from the Dock is especially remembered for his closing remarks. Historian Patrick Geoghehan has identified over seventy different versions of the text, but in an early printing (1818) based on notes taken by Burrowes, Emmet concludes:\nI am here ready to die. I am not allowed to vindicate my character; no man shall dare to vindicate my character; and when I am prevented from vindicating myself, let no man dare to calumniate me. Let my character and my motives repose in obscurity and peace, till other times and other men can do them justice. Then shall my character be vindicated; then may my epitaph be written.Chief Justice Lord Norbury sentenced Emmet to be hanged, drawn and quartered, as was customary for conviction of treason.  The following day, 20 September, Emmet was executed in Thomas Street in front of St. Catherine's. He was hanged and then beheaded once dead. As family members and friends of Robert had also been arrested, including some who had nothing to do with the rebellion, no one came forward to claim his remains out of fear of arrest.\nOn the eve of his execution, Emmet wrote from Kilmainham to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, William Wickham, whose \"fairness\" he acknowledged. He appears to have made a profound impression.In December Wickham resigned his post, confessing to friends that \"no consideration upon earth\" could induce him \"to remain after having maturely reflected\" on the contents of the note he had received. He could not enforce laws \"unjust, oppressive and unchristian\" and intolerable to the memory of a man he had been \"compelled by the duty of my office to pursue to the death\". Wickham was persuaded that Emmet had been attempting to save Ireland from \"a state of depression and humiliation\" and that, had he himself been an Irishman, he \"should most unquestionably have joined him\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_36191", "text": "Emmet's remains were first delivered to Newgate Prison and then back to Kilmainham Gaol, where the jailer was under instructions that if no one claimed them they were to be buried in a nearby hospital's burial grounds called Bully's Acre. Family tradition has it that in 1804, under cover of the burial of his sister, Mary Anne Holmes, Emmet's remains were removed from Bully's Acre and re-interred in the family vault (since demolished) at St Peter's Church in Aungier Street.After searching for Emmet's grave in Dublin, early in 1812, Percy Bysshe Shelley revised his elegiac poem \u201cThe Monarch's Funeral: An Anticipation\u201d: \"For who was he, the uncoffined slain, /That fell in Erin's injured isle /Because his spirit dared disdain/ To light his country's funeral pile?\"  In \"On Robert Emmet's Grave\" Shelley proposed that, because unknown, Emmet's grave would \"remain unpolluted by fame /Till thy foes, by the world and by fortune caressed, /Shall pass like a mist from the light of thy name.\"When Shelley returned to London from Dublin in 1812, it was with an account of Emmet's trial containing his famous speech, and Emmet appears again as the \u201cpatriot\u201d in The Devil's Walk, a lengthy broadside against a corrupt and un-reforming government. (At the same time, while in Dublin, Shelley had gone round streets and pubs of the city handing out An Address, to the Irish People, a 22-page pamphlet in which he pleaded with the Irish people not to repeat Emmet's attempt:  \"I do not wish to see things changed now, because it cannot be done without violence, and we may assure ourselves that none of us are fit for any change, however good, if we condescend to employ force in a cause we think right\").", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_36192", "text": "Emmet\u2019s rebellion infuriated Lord Castlereagh because he \"could not see the change that his own great measure the Union has effected in Ireland\".  Despite having so badly misfired, the 1803 rising suggested that the Act of Union was not going to be the palliative Castlereagh and Prime Minister William Pitt had intended. Castlereagh advised that \"the best thing would be to go into no detail whatever upon the case, to keep the subject clearly standing on its own narrow base of a contemptible insurrection without means or respectable leaders\", an instruction Plunket appears to have followed in Emmet's prosecution. This was to be a stance taken not only by unionists.\nDaniel O'Connell who was to lead the struggle for Catholic Emancipation and for repeal of the Union in the decades following Emmet's death, roundly condemned the resort to \"physical force\".  O'Connell's own programme of mobilising public opinion, fuelled by sometimes violent rhetoric and demonstrated in \"monster meetings\",  might have suggested that constitutionalism and physical force were complementary rather than antithetical. But O'Connell remained content with his dismissal of Emmet in 1803 as an instigator of bloodshed who had forfeited any claim to \"compassion\".Emmet's political rehabilitation begins in the Famine-years of the 1840s with the Young Irelanders. In 1846 they had finally broken with O'Connell declaring that if Repeal could not be carried by moral persuasion and peaceful means, a resort to arms would be \"a no less honourable course\". The Young Irelander publisher Charles Gavan Duffy repeatedly reprinted Michael James Whitty's popular chapbook Life, Trial and Conversations of Robert Emmet Esq. (1836), and promoted R.R. Madden's Life and Times of Robert Emmet (1847) which, despite its devastating account of the Thomas Street fiasco, was hagiographic.In carrying forward the tradition of physical-force republicanism from the debacle of the Young Irelander \"Famine Rebellion\" in 1848, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (the Fenians) also carried forward admiration for Emmet. On the $20 bonds they issued in 1866 in the United States in the name of the Irish Republic, his profile appears opposite that of Tone.Robert Emmet's older brother, Thomas Addis Emmet emigrated to the United States shortly after Robert's execution. He eventually served as the New York State Attorney General. His descendants (who included the prominent American portrait painters Lydia Field Emmet, Rosina Emmet Sherwood, Ellen Emmet Rand, and Jane Emmet de Glehn) helped advance his standing among the Irish diaspora, which in turn may have been one factor in ensuring that he was one among the \"ghosts\" invoked in the run-up to 1916 Easter Rising.In the Emmet Commemoration speech he delivered in New York City in March 1914, Pearse described how the spirit of Irish patriotism called in Emmet \"to a dreamer\" and  \"awoke a man of action\"; called to \"a student and a recluse\" and brought forth \"a leader of men\"; \"called to one who loved the ways of peace\" and found \"a revolutionary\".

Of interest are his translations of Goethe. From 1834 his contributions began appearing in the Dublin University Magazine. In 1840 he began producing translations from Turkish poetry, Persian poetry, Arabic poetry, and Irish poetry. He was also known for literary hoaxes; some of his \"translations\" are in fact works of his own, like Twenty Golden Years Ago, attributed to a certain Selber. His connection with The Dublin University Magazine was terminated because his habits rendered him incapable of regular application.\nHe was friends with the patriotic journalists Thomas Davis, and John Mitchel, who would write his biography. His poems were published in their newspaper The Nation. Mangan was for a time paid a fixed salary, but, as on former occasions, these relations were broken off, though he continued to send verses to \"The Nation\" even after he had cast in his lot with Mitchel, who in 1848 began to issue The United Irishman.Although his early poetry was often apolitical, after the Famine he began writing patriotic poems, including influential works such as Dark Rosaleen, a translation of R\u00f3is\u00edn Dubh and A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century. \n\nHis best-known poems include Dark Rosaleen, Siberia, Nameless One, A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century, The Funerals, To the Ruins of Donegal Castle, Pleasant Prospects for the Land-eaters and Woman of Three Cows.

There are many descriptions of his personal appearance at this time, all of them dwelling on his spare figure, his tight blue cloak, his witch's hat, and his inevitable umbrella. He was described by the artist William Frederick Wakeman as frequently wearing \"a huge pair of green spectacles\", padded shirts to hide his malnourished figure, and a hat which \"resembled those which broomstick-riding witches are usually represented with\".

It is hard not to acknowledge Mangan's debts to such translators and collectors of traditional Irish poetry as Samuel Ferguson and James Hardiman; many of Mangan's poems, for instance Dark Roseleen, appear to be adaptations of earlier translations rather than original translations.\nMangan is also frequently read as a Romantic poet. In particular, he is compared to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas De Quincey, largely thanks to his rumoured opium addiction and tendency to place his writing within the frame of a vision or dream.\nMore recently, critics have begun to read Mangan's work as a precursor to modernist and postmodernist experimental writing. His playful literary hoaxes and fake translations (which he called \"reverse plagiarism\") have been seen as a precursor to the works of Flann O'Brien.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_36346", "text": "During his life and immediately after, Mangan's legacy was co-opted by Irish nationalism, primarily thanks to John Mitchel's biography of Mangan, which stressed that Mangan was \"a rebel with his whole heart and soul against the whole British spirit\". Naturally, this helped to propel Mangan's legacy as Ireland's first national poet, and to lead later Irish writers to look back at his work.James Joyce wrote two essays on Mangan, the first in 1902 and the second in 1907 and also used his name in his works, for instance in Araby in Dubliners. Joyce wrote that in Mangan's poetry \"images interweave [their] soft, luminous scarves and words ring like brilliant mail, and whether the song is of Ireland or of Istambol it has the same refrain, a prayer that peace may come again to her who has lost peace, the moonwhite pearl of his soul\". Joyce also described Mangan as \"a prototype for a would-be-nation\", but stressed that he was ultimately a \"feeble figure\" that fell short of such promise.WB Yeats considered Mangan one of the best Irish poets, along with Thomas Davis and Samuel Ferguson, writing \"To the soul of Clarence Mangan was tied the burning ribbon of Genius.\"\nAmong the contemporary Irish writers he has influenced are Thomas Kinsella; Michael Smith; James McCabe, who wrote a sensationally discovered continuation of Mangan's autobiography that appeared in the Dublin journal Metre in 2001, but was later revealed \u2013 in a Mangan-style hoax \u2013 to be written by McCabe rather than Mangan; and David Wheatley, author of a sonnet sequence on Mangan. He is also cited by songwriter Shane MacGowan as an inspiration for both his work and his lifestyle. McGowan's song \"The Snake with Eyes of Garnet\" features Mangan as a character:\n\nA 1979 novel by Northern Irish/Canadian novelist Brian Moore, The Mangan Inheritance, tells the story of (fictional) young American James Mangan traveling to Ireland to find whether he is descended from the poet.\nWhile Mangan still has not acquired the critical clout of Joyce or Yeats, more recent literary criticism has begun to seriously consider his work. Largely, this can be attributed to the publication of David Lloyd's Nationalism and Minor Literature: James Clarence Mangan and the Emergence of Irish Cultural Nationalism in 1987. Lloyd's work was the first to seriously attempt to untangle Mangan the man from the nationalist poet fostered by John Mitchel.\nPrivate papers of Mangan are held in the National Library of Ireland, the Royal Irish Academy, and the archives of Trinity College, Dublin.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He then studied at Abbeville and Amiens before embarking as a helmsman on the fluyt Tamponne in 1776. In 1780, he joined the crew of the Degranbourg, a merchantman chartered by the Crown in Suffren's fleet, on which he took part in the Battle of Porto Praya. At the arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, Lejoille took command of Degranbourg while his father returned to France.In 1783, Lejoille returned to the merchant navy. On 6 May 1793, he was appointed Lieutenant and given command of the 14-gun corvette C\u00e9leste, which he ferried to Toulon. On 14, an incident occurred between C\u00e9leste and the Danish brig Franc-Navire, under Captain Elepsem, that triggered an investigation by the National Convention. Hennequin states that while crossing, C\u00e9leste captured the British war-brig Shout, of 18 guns.Arrived in Toulon, Lejoille was appointed to the Tonnant as first officer. He distinguished himself during the action of 8 June 1794 where the frigate Alceste was captured, and transferred on Alceste as her new captain. In 1795, he took part in the squadron under Admiral Martin, and was the first ship to overhaul and engage the 74-gun HMS Berwick at the action of 8 March 1795 where she was captured. A shot from Alceste having decapitated Berwick 's captain Adam Littlejohn, Lejoille was credited with much of the merit of the capture, and granted command of the prize. However, severely wounded at the right arm and leg, he was transferred to the flagship and convalesced in Genoa for eight months.Promoted to Chef de Division during his convalescence, Lejoille was first sent to Venice to oversee commissionings of the ships captured in the harbour, and then transferred to Corfu to take command of the 74-gun G\u00e9n\u00e9reux, in Brueys' squadron. He took part in the Battle of the Nile at the rear of the French line, duelling with HMS Bellerophon. His men inflicted heavy damage on the Bellerophon, but were damaged themselves in turn and eventually fled from the battlefield.\nAfter the Battle of the Nile, G\u00e9n\u00e9reux sailed to Corfu with Guillaume Tell and the frigate Diane and Justice, which he lost en route. Near Crete, G\u00e9n\u00e9reux met with HMS Leander, which she captured in the action of 18 August 1798. The British officers were released on parole.British sources later accused the French crew and Lejoille himself of plunder and various war crimes; the French captain who ferried the paroled officers of Leander to Trieste attacked the charges, and in his  Batailles navales de la France, Troude accuses William James of further \"augmenting\" the accusations originally published in the Gazette de Vienne. L\u00e9on Gu\u00e9rin claims that the accusations stem entirely from the Life of Nelson and that it furthermore fabricated a report by Lejoille.During the Siege of Corfu, Lejoille led G\u00e9n\u00e9reux to assist General Chabot and to harass the Russian blockade. As the situation of Corfu became more critical, Lejoille decided to organise a relief operation: he sailed to Ancona with G\u00e9n\u00e9reux and the brig Rivoli, where he loaded a 1000-man force, along with ammunition and food. One month later, he sailed back to Corfu.Awaiting a reconnaissance of Corfu, Lejoille decided to moor his ships in Brindisi harbour. In order to do so, he intended to sail past the fort defending the entrance channel without firing and attack it from behind. However, a navigation error grounded G\u00e9n\u00e9reux under the fort, forcing Lejoille to accept a gunnery duel. Lejoille was killed in the subsequent exchange of fire.Captain Touffet replaced Lejoille, and the fort and city of Brindisi surrendered after a two-hour battle. G\u00e9n\u00e9reux was refloated and awaited news from Corfu, which had in fact fallen on 3 March 1799; when informed, she put to sail and returned to Ancona.

This is notable on \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\", from the album Ha!-Ha!-Ha!. When Ultravox were recording Vienna, Cann's electronic ventures would become important for the Ultravox sound. The acquisition of a Roland CR-78 proved something of a headache for Cann, as he saw great sonic potential in it, but it had limited pattern programmability. In the process of adding some much needed practical customisations to the CR-78, Cann became somewhat persona non grata at the Roland headquarters in the UK. This did not stop Cann from carrying out his plans, and the result proved to be a key factor in the overall sound of their signature hit song \"Vienna\".\nThe initial reaction to the usage of drum machines led to bewilderment among the audience, who wondered what Cann was doing during some songs. Among claims that he was doing nothing, he decided to equip his drum machines with clear perspex cases instead of wood panels, and mount a variety of LEDs inside them as a feature Cann himself described as \"absolutely useless, but very impressive looking on a darkened stage; now it would be obvious I was actually doing something.\" (From Jonas W\u00e5rstad's interview at Discog)\nIn addition to his drum machine work, Cann designed several modifications for bass player Chris Cross' Minimoog, among them a primitive sequencer (built by Roy Gwinn) made from a series of toggle switches to add syncopation to the synthesiser's ability to create a stream of eighth notes, and a proprietary triggering system that allowed Cann and Cross to synchronise the Minimoog with Cann's drum machines, a feat performed almost three years before MIDI was officially introduced in 1983.

He endeavoured to have extremely precise timing; this would make the songs with live drums match songs driven by electronic, programmed percussion. For an example of this, compare the song \"Sleepwalk\", where Cann plays live drums, to \"Mr. X\", where the drums are sequenced. Both of these tracks can be found on Vienna. Despite his machine-like timing, Cann would often do things that neither drum machines nor electronically sequenced percussion could do at the time.  Specifically, he would often play very precise triplet fills and crescendos, especially on the snare drum. While these two techniques are easily accomplished by electronic instruments today, around 1979\u20131982 they were virtually impossible. In essence, it could fool the listeners to believe they were hearing a drum machine, only to prove them wrong through out-performing the rather rudimentary sequencing possibilities of the time.\nFrom a technical perspective, Cann preferred a traditional grip. On the Quartet album and subsequent tour (1982), Cann employed several sets of Simmons SDS-V electronic percussion pads, even to the point where he had an extra kit consisting of the hexagonal Simmons pads, which he played standing up. This way of playing was relatively unique and Cann seemed to be using this setup for one song only, namely \"The Song (We Go)\" from Quartet.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "19_36371", "text": "Speaking in 1986, Rush drummer Neil Peart named Cann as one of the drummers who had influenced and inspired him.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

He has been described as \"Ireland's first gay celebrity\".Hanley began presenting pop music shows on RT\u00c9 Radio Cork in 1976. He also did stints in Dublin on RT\u00c9 Radio 1 and RT\u00c9 television, including a special on Gilbert O'Sullivan. When the first dedicated pop station, RT\u00c9 Radio Two (now branded 2FM), was started in 1979, he was one of its best-known DJs. While in Dublin he shared accommodation with Charles Self. In 1981, he moved to London to work for Capital Radio. In 1984, he declined a lucrative offer to remain there and moved to New York City.Hanley founded Green Apple Productions in 1983 with Conor McAnally, an RT\u00c9 television producer and son of actor Ray McAnally. The company produced MT-USA (Music Television USA), a three-hour-long music video show modelled on the new American cable channel, MTV. MT-USA was broadcast on RT\u00c9 from 1984 to 1987 on Sunday afternoons. Each block of videos was followed by a segment filmed in New York City with Hanley introducing the videos, discussing American music and culture, and interviewing a celebrity. RT\u00c9 described him as Europe's first VJ (video jockey).In 1987, Hanley died shortly after his 33rd birthday. He had been visibly ill for some time, and was rumoured to have an AIDS-related illness, which he denied. This reflected the stigma then associated with the disease and with homosexuality in Ireland, which was not decriminalised until 1993. The illness admitted by Hanley was congenital cerebral toxoplasmosis, described as an \"eye disorder\"; he was blind in one eye by his death. Toxoplasmosis is very rarely fatal in adults who do not have a weakened immune system. In 2000, Hanley's friend and colleague Bill Hughes, who had himself come out in the 1990s, agreed that Hanley had in fact died of an AIDS-related illness. The same year, the Sunday Tribune newspaper placed Hanley at the top of a list of Irish gay icons.In February 2022, RT\u00c9 aired a new documentary about Hanley, titled Vincent Hanley: Sex, Lies and Videotapes.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

Despite being a sympathizer of Get\u00falio Vargas, Paul was a part of the Jewish underground resistance. Anna eventually suffered from a major paralysis due to a trauma caused by the fact that Jorge's sister, Susana, was not able to embark to Brazil with them, and so until he was 7 years old a nanny, L\u00facia, took care of him; L\u00facia was a m\u00e3e-de-santo, and introduced Jorge to Candombl\u00e9.\nIn 1948 Jorge's parents divorced, and Anna eventually remarried Henri M\u00fcller, a violinist who played for the S\u00e3o Paulo State Symphony, and who taught Jorge how to play the violin.

Convinced that, so long as his fellow Protestants feared to make common cause with the Catholic majority, the British Crown would continue to govern Ireland in the interest of England and of its client aristocracy, in 1791 Tone helped form the Society of United Irishmen. Although received in the company of a Catholic delegation by the King and his ministers in London, Tone, with other United Irish leaders, despaired of constitutional reform. Fuelled by the popular grievances of rents, tithes and taxes, and driven by martial-law repression, the society developed as an insurrectionary movement. When, in the early summer of 1798, it broke into open rebellion, Tone was in exile soliciting assistance from the French Republic. In October 1798, on his second attempt to land in Ireland with French troops and supplies, he was taken prisoner.
