They also booked more modern acts such as Alice Cooper, Chicago, and the Doors.On 12 September, Brower contacted Lennon, who was still a member of the Beatles, to ask him to be the master of ceremonies for the festival. Instead, Lennon offered to perform at the show with a new group, the Plastic Ono Band.\" Brower readily agreed, but since Lennon did not actually have a new group, he quickly began making phone calls to potential members to accompany himself and Yoko Ono. He initially approached Beatles band-mate George Harrison to play lead guitar, but Harrison declined, so Lennon turned to Eric Clapton, who had previously performed with Lennon in the one-off super group, the Dirty Mac. Bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Alan White soon agreed to perform, along with their assistants, Anthony Fawcett, Terry Doran, and Jill and Dan Richter. Voormann was a long-time friend of Lennon, but White, who was a respected session musician in London but did not know Lennon personally, initially thought that someone was prank calling him and only believed that the real John Lennon was on the phone when he called a second time.The group was scheduled to fly to Toronto on 12 September, the day before the concert, but Lennon, Ono, and Clapton were late to arrive at the airport. Lennon had talked to Clapton's management, but Clapton himself did not yet know that Lennon had invited him to perform and was not even aware of the concert. Brower managed to reach Clapton personally and told him to contact Lennon and Ono, who were still in bed. Clapton said he got \"a phone call on the day we were to leave and he said that someone had asked him to do that concert and it was that night! So I had to make the airport in an hour.\" The group had two quick rehearsals before appearing on stage. One was during the transatlantic flight from London to Toronto, though they could not hear the music very well since they were playing unplugged electric instruments. They had another at the concert venue shortly before appearing on stage. Lennon later said that the group \"didn't know what to play\" since they had not previously performed together, and they eventually settled on a set list consisting of older rock and roll standards, three Lennon-penned Beatle and solo songs, and two longer experimental songs featuring Ono.Though preparations for the show were rushed and chaotic, Lennon later said that he gained the confidence to leave the Beatles during those few days.

Before the start of the Plastic Ono Band's performance, they were introduced by Kim Fowley, and Lennon said to the crowd that the group were going to play only songs that they actually knew. They performed the Beatles' \"Yer Blues\", because Clapton had performed it with Lennon for The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, and his two solo songs, \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Cold Turkey\", the latter of which had its premiere at the festival. \"Cold Turkey\", presented as \"the newest song that John wrote\" by Ono, had Lennon reading the lyrics off a clip-board. Ono selected a song that was to be B-side of \"Cold Turkey,\" \"Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\", which also had its premiere at the festival. Shortly before the band went into \"Don't Worry Kyoko\", Lennon announced that Ono was \"gonna do her thing all over you\". The band closed with an electric version of the Wedding Album track \"John John (Let's Hope for Peace)\", an extended experimental number consisting of her screaming the title repeatedly to the feedback of the electric guitars. Towards the end of Ono's performance, the audience began to boo and whistle, and the band departed the stage leaving their guitars and bass to resonate until Mal Evans turned off the amplifiers. With their stage remarks, Lennon and Ono linked their appearance there to their ongoing campaign for peace.Lennon went to Abbey Road Studios on 25 September 1969 to mix the album from their eight-track recordings. While at the session, Lennon finished the stereo master for the album, although he did go back on 20 October to re-do the \"Don't Worry Kyoko\" stereo master, removing the majority of Ono's vocals from his songs and Clapton's backing vocals. The album is technically a soundtrack recording, being part of the audio portion of the documentary film being made of the festival by D.A. Pennebaker, later released as Sweet Toronto. Lennon and Ono made a deal with Pennebaker to license their portion of the show for record, in exchange for rights to include their appearance. According to the Beatles Monthly, due to the adverse reaction to Ono's performance, Pennebaker removed the segments with Lennon and Ono after limited screenings of the film, later re-edited as Keep on Rockin'.

The album came with a 13-month calendar that had photos, poems and songs in it, from Lennon's 1964 book In His Own Write, his 1965 book A Spaniard in the Works, and Ono's 1964 book Grapefruit. In the US, Capitol was reluctant at first to issue the album, after the commercial failures of Lennon's and Ono's experimental albums. Lennon recalled in an interview in December 1980 that he had to persuade Capitol to distribute the album: \"They said 'This is garbage, we're not going to put it out with her screaming on one side and you doing this sort of live stuff.' And they refused to put it out. But we finally persuaded them that ... people might buy this.\" In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon said that Capitol \"were on the [Paul] McCartney bandwagon, which they were on, and they thought that I was just an idiot pissing about with a Japanese broad and the music we were making, like Toronto, they didn't want to put out, because they didn't like that.\"Criticism was directed at side two of the LP, the side consisting entirely of two Yoko Ono songs. In a retrospective assessment, Richard Ginell of AllMusic remarks:\n\nSide two, alas, was devoted entirely to Ono's wailing, pitchless, brainless, banshee vocalizing on \"Don't Worry Kyoko\" and \"John John (Let's Hope for Peace)\" \u2013 the former backed with plodding rock rhythms and the latter with feedback. No wonder you see many used copies of the LP with worn A-sides and clean, unplayed B-sides \u2013 and Yoko's \"art\" is just as irritating today as it was in 1969. But in those days, if you wanted John you had to take the whole package.\nIn contrast, fellow musicians over the years remarked how Yoko Ono's half was a lot more inspirational and groundbreaking than the first half. Iggy Pop praised Yoko's part as \"the part that stands out.  The rest of it\u2018s just kinda pedestrian.\" Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction echoed similar feelings, stating that Ono's sound experimentations were a cornerstone of his musical education.Lennon later said he \"couldn't remember any of the words but it didn't matter\u2014I just made them all up and we made a great wonderful noise.\" Carl Perkins said to Lennon after the show that he was \"so beautiful you made me cry.\" A bootleg album of the concert appeared, under the title JL-YO-EC, thanks to an audience recording, which was released about the same time as the official album.After Lennon's death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set released in the UK on 15 June 1981. The album was reissued in the US in 1982, by Capitol, and again in 1986. The album was originally scheduled to appear on CD for the first time in June 1989, but the plan was scrapped. Ono, with the help of Rob Stevens from Quad Recording, supervised a remixing of Live Peace in Toronto 1969 for its compact disc issue, released on 1 May 1995. Two of the remixed tracks feature a variation in Ono's vocals: while \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\" has additional backing vocals from Ono, \"Money\" has fewer backing vocals from Ono.

It was also decided that the singers' collaboration would be recorded in series and presented in the form of an episodic documentary, such that music lovers too could experience the process of composing music. Finally, a web concert featuring both the singers was planned in which the full song would be officially unveiled.\nKailash Kher, who has written and composed \"Naina Chaar\", described it as 'a rustic song with earthy lyrics'. Besides the web episodes and web concert, Sony also introduced other engagement activities like quiz on the journeys of both the singers, AR app from Ghoshal and Kher greeting fans and sharing signed photographs and an online voting system for the selection of songs to be performed at the web concert.

Reviewers of The Wrath of Khan, such as Roger Ebert, rated Khan as one of the strongest aspects of the film. New Yorker critic Pauline Kael said Montalb\u00e1n's performance \"was the only validation he has ever had of his power to command the big screen.\"Critic Christopher Null notes that \"it is nearly gospel now among Trekkies that... Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is the undisputed best of the series, and will likely never meet its equal,\" and calls Khan the \"greatest role of [Montalb\u00e1n's] career\". Though he felt that the villain of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, V'Ger, was more cerebral and interesting, author James Iaccino notes that most fans and moviegoers preferred the archetypical good-versus-evil fight that the struggle between Khan and Kirk represents. Villains in subsequent Star Trek films have been measured by the standard of Khan, with Paramount promising fans that the villain of Star Trek Generations would be equal to the genetic superman. IGN ranked Khan as the best Star Trek villain, noting that he set the pattern for revenge-seeking villains in the series; in the decades since the film's release, \"even those with a passing interest [in Trek] know the name.\"Star Trek producer Rick Berman called the villain \"threatening and memorable.\"Khan is also recognized as a great villain outside of the Star Trek series. The Associated Press called the character \"one of sci-fi's great villains\". In 2002, the Online Film Critics Society's 132 members voted Khan as the 10th-greatest screen villain of all time, the only Star Trek character to appear in the listing. In 2006, Emmy Magazine voted Khan \"TV's Most Out-of-This-World Character\", beating out other science fiction characters such as the Doctor and Commander Adama. Editors wrote that \"Khan was so cool we would've bought a Chrysler Cordoba if he'd told us to,\" alluding to an ad campaign Montalb\u00e1n appeared in for Chrysler. The character also had a cultural impact outside of Star Trek fandom; a clip from The Wrath of Khan featuring Kirk screaming \"Khaaan!\" was one popular culture appropriation that became a \"popular fad\" driving the success of the website YTMND.In 2004, the Star Trek franchise returned to Khan's backstory in a three-episode story arc on Star Trek: Enterprise. In \"Borderland\", \"Cold Station 12\" and \"The Augments\", a 22nd-century scientist is portrayed as having revived genetically engineered embryos from Khan's time and raised them as \"Augments\". Enterprise producer Manny Coto described these characters as \"mini Khan Noonien Singhs\". A descendant of Khan, La'an Noonien-Singh, appears in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds; in the time-traveling episode \"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\", Khan appears as a child played by Desmond Sivan.Benedict Cumberbatch's performance in Star Trek Into Darkness drew praise from critics with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine calling it a \"tour-de-force to be reckoned with\" and his character \"a villain for the ages\". Joe Neumaier of New York's Daily News wrote that Cumberbatch delivered \"one of the best blockbuster villains in recent memory\". Jonathan Romney of The Independent specifically noted Cumberbatch's voice saying it was \"So sepulchrally resonant that it could have been synthesised from the combined timbres of Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Alan Rickman holding an elocution contest down a well.\" The New York Times praised his screen presence saying \"He fuses Byronic charisma with an impatient, imperious intelligence that seems to raise the ambient I.Q. whenever he's on screen.\"Christian Blauvelt from website Hollywood.com criticized the casting of Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness as being \"whitewashed into oblivion\". Star Trek: Voyager actor Garrett Wang tweeting, \"The casting of Cumberbatch was a mistake on the part of the producers. I am not being critical of the actor or his talent, just the casting.\"\nCo-producer and co-screenwriter Roberto Orci addressed the issue of the casting:Basically, as we went through the casting process and we began honing in on the themes of the movie, it became uncomfortable for me to support demonizing anyone of color, particularly any one of Middle Eastern descent or anyone evoking that. One of the points of the movie is that we must be careful about the villain within us, not some other race.\nIn 2016, ScreenRant rated Khan as the 6th-best character in Star Trek overall.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The album charted at number two on the Billboard 200 and its single \"Hands Down\" reached number eight on the Alternative Songs chart. The group contributed the track \"Vindicated\", which was produced by Don Gilmore, to the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack released in June 2004. Later that month, a live recording of a new track \"So Long, So Long\" appeared on the group's website. The track marked a change from their past work as it included a piano. Carrabba said the next album would be a piano-driven effort with contributions from the other members. Following this, Carrabba spent the rest of the summer writing material for a new album.In December, the group got together and played through the songs they had. Though Carrabba considered a lot of it unsatisfactory, he figured out the vibe for the next album: \"I have this passionate desire to sort of explore space ... [as opposed to] compounding everything into these driving parts.\"  In February 2005, Carrabba scrapped an album's worth of songs as he felt they were too safe: \"[F]ans probably would have liked those songs. And people who weren't would have had the same complaints as ever.\" Carrabba spent two weeks in Florida making several batches of demos of over 30 songs.

Despite having already having plans to record, Carrabba was invited to Jamaica, where Lanois was, to discuss the songs. He flew out and the pair spent a week talking about songs. A day after returning home, Lanois was interested in producing the album. In April, the group worked with Lanois and recorded 20 songs. Half of them at Lanois' home in Toronto, Canada, and the other half at Lanois' other home in Silver Lake, California. Sessions also took place at NRG, Avatar, Pilot, Mission Sound, Quad Studios, The Loft and La Bella Vista. Mark Kiczula acted as the main engineer with assistance from Jim Keller, Chad Lupo, Guiliano Baglioni, Roberto Fulps and Matt Shane. Additional engineering was done by Fox Phelps, Adam Samuels and Daniel Mendez.Carrabba experimented with a variety of instruments from mandolins to metal flowers pots that substituted as drums. At the end of the month, Carrabba went on a solo tour of colleges and debuted some of the new songs. In September, the group supported U2 on their North American tour. In between these support dates, the group performed a few club shows. Prior to starting the tour, Carrabba said the album required mixing. Despite this, material was still being recorded up to January 2006. Lanois left the project; Carrabba wanted to record another track, at which point Gilmore was brought in. Carrabba subsequently went on a song writing binge, creating six songs across four days. Sometime afterwards, Carrabba decided to rework the Lanois-produced material with Gilmore, while retaining some of Lanois' contributions. In March, Gilmore and Carrabba recorded an album's worth of songs.Gilmore is credited as producing the majority of the album, with the exception of \"Heaven Here\" which is credited to him and Lanois. Lanois also received a producer credit for the vocals on \"Reason to Believe\". Marsh said that due to the structure of the songs and melodies, the recording process give him a \"great opportunity to create space.\" Andy Wallace mixed all of the album, except for \"Don't Wait\" (mixed by Gilmore), at Soundtrack Studios in New York City.

This led to Adele signing a recording contract at age 17 with the label and providing vocals for Jack Pe\u00f1ate. During this session for Pe\u00f1ate's song she met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce the majority of her debut album.\nFour singles were released from the album, with \"Chasing Pavements\" and \"Make You Feel My Love\" reaching the top ten on the UK Singles Chart, while the former became Adele's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also contains her first song, \"Hometown Glory\", written when she was 16, which is based on her home suburb of West Norwood in London.\nNamed after the age of the singer during its release and production, 19 is a blue-eyed soul album with folk rock, indie pop, and jazz influences and lyrics describing heartbreak, nostalgia and relationships. 19 received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Adele's vocal prowess and songwriting talent at such a young age and noted her as having the \"potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation.\" 19 was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize.

She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and given it to a friend. The friend posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to a phone call from Richard Russell, boss of the music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting.Nick Huggett, at XL, recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management, and in June 2006, Dickins became her official representative.

The singer asserted greater creative control over the project \u2014 as a co-producer and composer of the material \u2014 compared to her previous work, assisted by Brothers in Rhythm, Manic Street Preachers, David Ball and Rob Dougan.\nInfluenced by the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s, sonically, Impossible Princess is a departure from Minogue's previous work. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from dance music, including trip hop, electronica, and rock. Lyrically, the album focuses on Minogue's self-discovery after a series of trips worldwide and delves into freedom of expression, relationships, and emotions.\nUpon its release, critical and public reception of Impossible Princess was divided over its new musical direction and Minogue's intimate lyrics. Commercially, the album reached the top 10 in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom; the British media, however, mocked its lack of success in Europe. Four singles were released from the album, including two UK top-20 entries \"Did It Again\" and \"Breathe\". Minogue embarked on the Intimate and Live tour in 1998 to support the album.\nIn retrospect, various commentators have cited Impossible Princess as Minogue's most personal and misunderstood work. Despite this, Minogue has said she would never create another studio album of personal songs like Impossible Princess. To celebrate 25 years since the album's original release, it was released on vinyl for the first time in October 2022, leading to its resurgence and reaching new peaks on record charts.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_22545", "text": "Minogue left her label PWL in 1992 because of creative differences and signed a three-album deal with Deconstruction Records the following year. She worked with a diverse group of collaborators to experiment with different sounds, including the British duo Brothers in Rhythm. Their first offering was Minogue's self-titled album in late 1994, which peaked at number three in Australia and number four in the United Kingdom. Besides promotional commitments for the album, Minogue expanded her acting career by taking part in several projects. Among them were big-budget films Street Fighter (1994) and Bio-Dome (1996), which were received poorly by critics. Minogue worked with Australian musician Nick Cave and his band, the Bad Seeds on their 1995 single \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\", which peaked at number two in Australia and number eleven in the UK. The song earned three ARIA Awards for Best Pop Release, Single, and Song of the Year in 1996.Minogue's friendship with Cave continued over the years; on Cave's advice, Minogue recited the lyrics to her 1987 song \"I Should Be So Lucky\" as poetry at London's Royal Albert Hall in July 1996. In December, she made a surprise appearance at a Manic Street Preachers concert at the Shepherd's Bush Empire, singing \"Little Baby Nothing\" with them. The track was planned initially as a duet with Minogue but did not materialise during her years under contract with PWL. Both 1996 live performances were viewed as the starting point of her new alter ego, \"IndieKylie\", a pseudonym that dealt with Minogue's move to rock music. Minogue began a romantic relationship with French photographer St\u00e9phane Sednaoui and embarked on a series of trips with him throughout North America, Asia, and Australasia to gain inspiration for her upcoming record. By the end of the trip, Minogue was enamoured by the experience and felt \"truly anonymous and free to be [herself]\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_22546", "text": "Plans for Impossible Princess began in mid-1995 after meetings with Brothers in Rhythm had taken place and recording the album began. By June 1997, the album had been in production for twenty-one months, and Deconstruction were adding the final touches to it. The album took nearly two years to record\u2014the longest period Minogue had worked on a project since her time acting on the Australian soap opera Neighbours (from 1986 to 1988). Many changes of direction, remixes and cowriters lengthened the process which at times upset and infuriated Minogue. Brothers in Rhythm member Steve Anderson explained this was \"due to the pure perfectionism\" of everyone involved; Minogue felt the album was worth the wait.Minogue's trips with Sednaoui, her Deconstruction label mates, and clients of Sednaoui's work including Bj\u00f6rk, Garbage, and Tricky inspired the album. Sednaoui and Cave were key factors during the production. In the biography Kylie (2014), Sean Smith notes Sednaoui had a huge effect on Minogue's belief in herself and contributed to her vision of the future, while Cave helped her to embrace the past. Minogue began writing lyrics after Sednaoui and Cave convinced her to take creative control over her next musical project. She wrote every track on the album\u2014in contrast, she co-wrote only one song on her 1994 studio album.  She did not have any specific method for writing: she wrote constantly in her notebook and composed many songs during the holidays. \"Cowboy Style\" and \"Dreams\" were among the earliest songs Minogue wrote for the album; the lyrics and melodies came easily to her. Minogue imagined performing \"Too Far\" while working on its lyrics, which she did at a local cafe. She found the track easy to write and did not sound like anything she had written before. She wanted to put herself into the album as much as possible, and felt the songs were more personal: \"I've written lyrics before, but they've been safe\u2013just neatly rhymed words and that's that.

It is a departure from her previous sound, encompassing various elements from dance music. Music critics commented on the album's musical diversity. Marcel Anders of Orkus, and Nick Levine at Digital Spy labelled it a dance record, while a writer from Who magazine wrote the album ranges from trip hop, torch songs to scratchy guitar pop, and disco tracks. Sputnikmusic writers pointed out trance, rock, and alternative influences, and described the album as \"something you would expect Bj\u00f6rk to make\". Michael Dwyer of The West Australian found the club-oriented production made the album standout. Chris True of AllMusic and Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine identified the record as part of the electronica and Britpop movements that spanned the mid-to-late 1990s.\nImpossible Princess incorporates live instrumental tracks, such as a trumpet solo by English trumpeter Guy Barker on \"Through the Years\". Minogue found this unusual because she was familiar only with the use of synthesizers on her tracks, and considered the album a mixture between synthetics and real instruments. The album contains several guitar-driven songs, such as \"Did It Again\" and \"I Don't Need Anyone\". \"Did It Again\" blends drums and electric guitar, which Smith found similar to the sound of The Beatles' Revolver (1966). \"I Don't Need Anyone\" is a rock song heavily influenced by Middle Eastern beats. Moore played drums and Bradfield played guitars on the joyful Britpop-style tracks \"I Don't Need Anyone\" and \"Some Kind of Bliss\". Critics compared the latter track to Motown music and the work of Manic Street Preachers.\"Cowboy Style\" is a country number that was influenced by Celtic music and tribal percussion. Ian Phillips of Sputnikmusic wrote that the orchestral pop ballad \"Dreams\" uses a mixture of eerie-sounding strings, booming bass, and drums. Cinquemani described the chaotic drum and bass \"Too Far\" as a blend of crisp breakbeats, a Moby-style piano progression and lush strings; \"Drunk\" as a trance song; and \"Limbo\" as a hybrid between rock and techno in the style of The Chemical Brothers. \"Jump\" is a dark trip hop track, while \"Say Hey\" and \"Breathe\" are subtle electronic-infused songs. \"Through the Years\" contains muted horns, experimental vocal tracks and mournful lyrics; Cinquemani compared it to Bj\u00f6rk's 1993 single \"Venus as a Boy\".The record's vocals feature segments of spoken word and rapping, alongside whispering and singing. John Mangan of Australia's The Age newspaper felt the songs were tailored-made for her voice. A writer from Who noted Minogue was developing her own voice on the album, saying she is \"whispering breathlessly one moment, shrieking like a young Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor the next\". Another writer from the same publication felt that Minogue \"never sounded more human\", with many songs showcasing her unique phrasing. In the biography Kylie: Naked (2012), Nigel Goodall and Jenny Stanley-Clarke likened Minogue's vocals to those of Tori Amos, Bj\u00f6rk, Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, Kate Bush and Madonna. Cinquemani and Dwyer also compared Minogue's seductive delivery to Madonna, and described her vocals as a \"sexy [and] reliable secret weapon\". Larry Flick of Billboard commented that Minogue had dropped the pitch-perfect vocals and let her \"odd noises flow freely\" on the album.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_22548", "text": "Impossible Princess deals with the theme of romantic relationships, self-discovery, emotional pain and freedom of expression. Critics and Dave Seaman noted that Minogue's personal input was more significant on this album. Most of the album is autobiographical, based upon Minogue's life during the two years preceding the album. Sean Smith believed the songs reveal her life more than any interview, as they were more \"complex, serious, introspective and challenging\" than the songs on her previous albums. Minogue discuss her paranoia, pain and anger in \"Too Far\", in which she sings in a quick, rambling way about suffering from claustrophobia. Negative stories that the British press had published about Minogue inspired \"Did It Again\". The track sees Minogue struggling to find the right identity. She uses an aggressive vocal style and whines about how she is messed up despite having it all. \"Jump\" advises the public to accept her and her personal choices throughout the course of her career.\n\n\"I Don't Need Anyone\" does not have a linear storyline; the set of lyrics was taken from four songs, each interpreting a different mood and story. Cinquemani noted the energetic track sees Minogue wildly declare her independence while admitting her inborn vulnerability. \"Some Kind of Bliss\" talks about Minogue's experiences while away from people and being happy. Written in Japan, the fifth track, \"Breathe\", expresses her ability to contemplate and feel peaceful while in an intense environment. \"Dreams\" discussing the persistence of pushing boundaries and experimentation throughout her career. Phillips wrote that \"Dreams\", the closing cinematic track, tells a thought-provoking fairytale.The record's remaining tracks discuss her relationship with Sednaoui. \"Cowboy Style\" details Minogue meeting Sednaoui for the first time. Minogue wrote \"Limbo\" in Spain, in which she discusses her inability to leave a certain country to meet someone, because of problems with its bureaucracy. Inspired by her relationship with Sednaoui, \"Say Hey\" highlights the need for communication, though not delving into conversation. Flick highlighted the self-examining lyrics of \"Limbo\" and \"Say Hey\", commenting that Minogue had liberated darker thoughts from her subconscious on the album. The theme of frustration lingers in \"Drunk\", which has Minogue feeling unsatisfied with the relationship, despite having so much feeling for someone. Minogue mentions meeting an ex-boyfriend on \"Through the Years\", feeling insecure and doubtful about the entire situation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The song also states that man made toys for the baby boys and girls, and comments about the fact that \"Man makes money\" to buy from other men. Before the song's fade, Brown states that man is lost in his bitterness and in the wilderness. Brown's co-writer and onetime girlfriend, Betty Jean Newsome, wrote the lyrics based on her own observations of the relations between the sexes. Newsome claimed in later years that Brown did not write any part of the song, and she argued in court that he sometimes forgot to pay her royalties. In May 1966, Record World magazine reported that Brown, King Records and Dynatone Publishing were being sued by Clamike Records for alleged copyright infringement of the Betty Newsome song \"It's a Man's World (But What Would He Do Without a Woman)\".The composition of \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" developed over a period of several years. Tammy Montgomery, better known as Tammi Terrell, recorded \"I Cried\", a Brown-penned song based on the same chord changes, in 1963. Brown himself recorded a demo version of the song, provisionally entitled \"It's a Man's World\", in 1964.

Producers Robert Marvin (Mat Kearney, tobyMac) and Dan Muckala (Brandon Heath, Backstreet Boys) collaborated to give the album its high-energy output.\"CCM Magazine's Andrew Greer said \"oscillating between vulnerable tracks that vocalize the struggle to surrender to God and sunny tunes of sheer fun, The Lost Get Found is an attractive set list. And though the lyrics may be a bit vague at times, this is pop music, and excellent pop music at that.\"Christian Music Review's Kevin Davis said \"'The Lost Get Found' is a great and catchy album by Britt Nicole. The title track, 'Safe', 'Hanging On', 'Headphones', 'Walk on The Water' and 'Have Your Way' are my favorite songs on the album. Along with 'Life Light Up' by Christy Nockels this is my top album by a female artist and one of my top overall albums of the year. If you liked 'Relentless' by Natalie Grant and 'My Paper Heart' by Francesca Battistelli, then you\u2019ll love 'The Lost Get Found' by Britt Nicole.\"Cross Rhythms' Simon Eden said \"this is pop nearing perfection. Remarkably, every track on this, Britt's second album, has the potential to become a US/UK mainstream number one hit with sufficient airplay. That success is beginning to show with the album and the title track single both hitting number one on the US Christian charts. With slightly breathy, sultry, intimate verses balanced with powerful choruses, each song radiates such positivity that you wonder how they managed to get the rainbows and sunshine packaged in.\" Eden wrote \"Musically targeted at excitable teenage girls, the Christian aspect is brilliantly natural and portrays God as a normal integrated part of any teenager's life without dumbing down or hyped worship and is a major credit to Britt's songwriting. As a pop album it fits into a mainstream genre and consequently sounds similar to singers like Avril Lavigne, which is no bad thing.\"Jesus Freak Hideout's Nathaniel Schexnayder wrote that \"despite some clich\u00e9 lyrics and the absence of more straight-up terrific highlights, The Lost Get Found is a fun album which definitely is a solid follow up to Say It. But even though the pop dance tunes are catchy, Meyers and many other pop-flair dependent artists routinely produce similar ear candy. The blend of youth and a refined pop beat combined on the title track is likely the direction where Britt Nicole should go in order to stand-out more. After all, that's how the good get better.\"Louder Than the Music's Suzanne Physick said \"Every once in a while you find a track that perfectly sums up something you have been trying to say for ages but have never managed to find the words. For me, Have Your Way is that track. It is the perfect pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Simply with that and the wonderfully written Headphones the album would be worth buying but the truth [is] that there are 9 other fantastic tracks that come along with them and you really shouldn't miss out on any one of them.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_22578", "text": "Britt Nicole \u2013 all vocals, programming (6), additional keyboards (8), acoustic piano (11)\nDan Muckala \u2013 programming (1, 4, 7, 9, 10), keyboards (1, 4, 7, 9, 10), bass programming (1, 4, 7, 9, 10), drums (1, 4, 7, 9, 10)\nRobert Marvin \u2013 programming (2, 3, 6, 8), all other instruments (2, 3, 8), additional programming (11)\nAdam Scott \u2013 programming (2), acoustic guitar (2)\nAndy Selby \u2013 additional programming (3, 11), strings (3)\nChuck Butler \u2013 guitars (1, 4, 7, 9, 10)\nAdam Lester \u2013 guitars (1, 4, 7, 9, 10)\nAlbert Kiteck \u2013 guitars (5)\nLoren Prothero \u2013 guitars (6)\nCary Barlowe \u2013 guitars (8)\nMike Payne \u2013 guitars (8)\nTony Lucido \u2013 bass (3)\nJoshua Crosby \u2013 drums (2, 3, 8), programming (5, 6), additional programming (8)", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_22579", "text": "Dan Muckala \u2013 producer (1, 4, 7, 9, 10), engineer (1, 4, 7, 9, 10), mixing (1, 4, 7, 9, 10)\nRobert Marvin \u2013 producer (2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11), recording (3, 6, 8, 11), mixing (6, 11)\nAdam Scott \u2013 co-producer (2)\nJoshua Crosby \u2013 recording assistant (3, 6, 8, 11), co-producer (5)\nChuck Butler \u2013 additional vocal editing (1, 4, 7, 9, 10)\nF.

Like their song \"Tire Me\" from the 1996 album Evil Empire, \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d never had a music video or was released on any media formats. It did, however, receive enough radio airplay to become an album favorite.\nThe artwork most commonly associated with the song is from a competition the band held for the then upcoming album The Battle of Los Angeles. Competing artists were given titles to put on their covers including \"Agunzagun\", \"Battle Hymns\", and \"The Battle of Los Angeles\". One of the titles was even a verse from \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d - \"The Riot Be the Rhyme of the Unheard\". Tom Morello eventually used the name \"Battle Hymns\" for a track on his debut album, One Man Revolution in 2007.\n\"Calm Like a Bomb\" is notable as a display of guitarist Tom Morello's creative use of a whammy pedal. Like many of RATM's songs, the song's lyrics take a radical and violent approach to the topic of social inequalities. The song also features a reference to Emiliano Zapata. Tim Commerford uses a combination of a home-made overdrive pedal and the Jim Dunlop 105Q Bass Wah pedal on his bass throughout the song. In Rolling Stone magazine's feature article on the new \"Guitar Heroes,\" a section was printed about Tom Morello, and \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d was cited as the prime example of his skill and fame on the guitar. He has occasionally referred to the extremely high whammy-pedal effects used in songs such as this as \"pterodactyl sounds.\"\n\"Calm Like a Bomb\" made its live debut on June 11, 1999, at the K-Rock Dysfunctional Family Picnic in Wantagh, New York at Jones Beach Amphitheater.\nIt was prominently featured in the ending credits of The Matrix Reloaded and was also included in the film's soundtrack.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Flowers commented; \u201cMy version of what the song is about is different than what Anthony is portraying in the video\u201d. In a frame story, it tells the story of a young woman around the age of 20. The video opens with her arriving at a large, white, wooden cross in a rocky hill. She mourns in front of it until a man, who had been desperately searching for her, shows up and comforts her. The following scenes are mostly flashbacks that would illustrate the story of how they came to be there.\nThe first of these flashbacks is one in which the same woman is praying at a church; after leaving, she encounters the man outside. They kiss and it is evident that there is a romantic relationship between them. One day she arrives home to their shared house to find the man in bed with another woman; seeing them together, she leaves the house, heavily distraught. As the woman runs through the town with tears in her eyes, the video flashes back to their joyous wedding, making it clear that they are husband and wife and that they were thoroughly happy together. The next scene is another flashback in which the man gazes on as she pours water on her legs, demonstrating the attraction he had for her.\nLater, the video cuts to a very early scene in the story, set within a bar that the man appears to own. The woman enters and introduces herself for the first time to her future husband, who at the time was chatting to his future mistress. It appears as though she had applied for employment at the bar, because he promptly gives her an apron and leads her away into another room, much to the annoyance of the other woman. In this room the Killers are playing to a small crowd within the bar and in the drums says \"Los Dientes Del Perro\" as the band name, that in Spanish means \"The Dog's Teeth\". She shares a prolonged look with Brandon Flowers as he sings the last verse, before turning away to attend to the man's instructions. The final shot of the music video comes back to the first scene set next to wooden cross, with the woman still on the ground and her husband there with her.\nThe video stars Mexican actors Gustavo S\u00e1nchez Parra & Sonia Couoh.\nThere is also an alternate version of the video in which the woman jumps off a cliff instead of reconciling with the husband.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_22688", "text": "CD: Island / ISLR16591-2 United States\n\n\"When You Were Young\" (radio version) \u2013 3:39US promo7-inch: Vertigo / 170 672-1 United Kingdom\n\n\"When You Were Young\" \u2013 3:39\n\"Where the White Boys Dance\" \u2013 3:26CD: Vertigo / 170 765-8 United Kingdom\n\n\"When You Were Young\" \u2013 3:39\n\"All the Pretty Faces\" \u2013 4:44CD: Island / 0 602517 07658 7 Germany\n\n\"When You Were Young\" \u2013 3:39\n\"All the Pretty Faces\" \u2013 4:44\n\"When You Were Young\" (video)CD: Island / ISLR 16633-2 United States\n\n\"When You Were Young\" (Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke Radio Edit) \u2013 3:58\n\"When You Were Young\" (The Lindbergh Palace Radio Edit) \u2013 4:31\n\"When You Were Young\" (Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke Mix) \u2013 6:23\n\"When You Were Young\" (The Lindbergh Palace Remix) \u2013 6:59\n\"When You Were Young\" (Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke Dub) \u2013 6:23\n\"When You Were Young\" (The Lindbergh Palace Dub) \u2013 6:50US promo2x12-inch: Island / B0007884-11 United States\n\n\"When You Were Young\" (Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke Mix) \u2013 6:23\n\"When You Were Young\" (The Lindbergh Palace Remix) \u2013 6:59\n\"When You Were Young\" (Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke Dub) \u2013 6:23\n\"When You Were Young\" (The Lindbergh Palace Dub) \u2013 6:50", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_22689", "text": "Coldplay's Chris Martin covered the song at an unplanned appearance for MENCAP.\nAmy Macdonald covered the song in her native Scotland and at Lowlands Fest in 2008.\nBiffy Clyro covered the song on live radio on \"Today FM\".\nThe Infamous Stringdusters covered the song live for The A.V.

It was released on September 29, 1997, by Columbia Records as the second single from the album. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. \"Butterfly\" is a  pop and R&B ballad combining elements of gospel. Carey had originally conceived it as a house record with David Morales titled \"Fly Away\" (Butterfly Reprise). After realizing how personal the lyrics were and how they could be applied to Butterfly, she wrote the album's title track with Afanasieff. On the song's lyrics, Carey sings to someone, telling them to spread their wings and release into the world on their own, like a butterfly.\nThe accompanying music video for \"Butterfly\" depicts Carey in an abandoned house, trapped in a desolate life. As the video progresses, she leaves, apparently for the first time in years, and runs into a nearby meadow. Towards the end, Carey jumps over a barbed fence and goes out into the world on a horse. The song's lyrics and video were directly connected to Carey's personal life at the time. \"Butterfly\" was performed live on the Late Show with David Letterman, Saturday Night Live, and various European television programs. The song was also a permanent part of the set-list during her Butterfly World Tour in 1998. The single performed weakly on the charts, peaking outside the top 20 in most countries, except for New Zealand, where it peaked at number 15. The song also reached the top-ten in Croatia and Taiwan.

While writing the material for the album, she wrote a house music record titled \"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\" with David Morales. When the song was finished, Carey felt there was something more she could do with the song; the lyrics were very personal and a perfect fit for a ballad. After contemplating on the matter, Carey re-wrote \"Fly Away\" in ballad form, and incorporated new lyrics and vocals.\n\nIt was '97 and I was leaving my marriage [to Tommy Mottola]. which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's what he would say to me. There's a part that goes, 'I have learned that beauty / has to flourish in the light / wild horses run unbridled / or their spirit dies / you have given me the courage / to be all that I can / and I truly feel ...[sings] and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you're ready to land.' At that point I really believed that I was going to go back to the marriage \u2013 I didn't think I was going to leave forever. But then the things that happened to me during that time caused me to not go back. Had it been, 'Go be yourself, you've been with me since you were a kid, let's separate for a while,' I probably would've.\n\nThe song was named \"Butterfly\" and became Carey's \"favorite and most heartfelt ballad.\" Its lyrics were very personal, linking to Carey's personal life and relationship with Mottola. Carey wrote \"Butterfly\" for Mottola, hoping he would say its contents to her, and choose to do what was best for her.

The notable maturity in her lyrics and worldly warmth of her vocal reflect the growth that she has continually strived to attain.\" British magazine Music Week gave it four out of five, adding, \"This is as smooth as any of her ballads, but it's in the vocals where the difference lies. No longer over-singing for the sake of it, Carey has rarely sounded more stunning.\" Rick Juzwiak from Slant Magazine gave the song a mixed review, but felt it was a pivotal part of Carey's vocal and musical transition. Juzwiak wrote \"The agonizingly slow 'Butterfly,' with its predictably soaring chorus and if-it-comes-back-it-was-meant-to-be message, would have been ignorable tripe.

Keyboardist Dee Palmer recalled her diary entries at the time of recording as saying that \"I'd start at 7pm and go home at 7am!\" Heavy Horses was the first album on which Anderson began to experience vocal issues, the beginning of an affliction which would become more serious in the 1980s and later develop into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Anderson's vocals sound more nasal and gruff on some of the album's tracks as a result, particularly on the title track.As with the band's previous album Songs from the Wood, other members of the band beyond just Anderson were involved in writing music for the album, with guitarist Martin Barre writing portions of the title track and \"No Lullaby\" and Palmer writing string arrangements for most of the album as well as the instrumental bridge of \"...And the Mouse Police Never Sleeps\".

{"id": "175_217", "question": "Who performed Wreck on the Highway?", "ctxs": [{"id": "175_22827", "text": "\"Wreck on the Highway\" is a song written and performed by Bruce Springsteen.  It was originally released as the final track on his fifth album, The River.  The version released on The River was recorded at The Power Station in New York in March\u2013April 1980.  As well as being the last track on The River, it was the last song recorded for the album.A melancholic song with a false ending, \"Wreck on the Highway\" features prominent organ and acoustic guitar parts.  The song is structured as a folk ballad with four verses of five lines each.  The rhyme scheme of the verse endings is generally ABCCB, but this is not followed absolutely strictly.  The lyrics describe a man who witnesses a hit-and-run auto accident on a rainy, isolated highway, and is subsequently haunted by the vision and unable to sleep.  After the first three verses focus on the specific incident, the last verse broadens the theme to encompass more universal themes of life and death.  The singer thinks about the life that was lost, and the people who may have loved him, and he knows he will be haunted by the incident for the rest of his life.  Springsteen has explained the theme by stating that after seeing the accident the singer \"realizes that you have a limited number of opportunities to love someone, to do your work, to be part of something, to parent your children, to do something good.\"  It is directly inspired by Roy Acuff's country song of the same name and similar theme from the 1940s, which is a cover version of the 1938 recorded song, \"I Didn't Hear Nobody Pray\", by the Dixon Brothers. While Springsteen's song has elements of a country arrangement, its music is more haunted and less sentimental.Along with the title track, \"Independence Day\" and \"Point Blank\", it is one of the verse-chorus songs on The River that was essentially a short story or character sketch. \"Wreck on the Highway\" and a few other songs on The River, such as the title track and \"Stolen Car\", mark a new direction in Bruce Springsteen's songwriting: these ballads imbued with a sense of hopelessness anticipate his next album, Nebraska, as well as a turn towards pessimism in his overall artistic and personal world-view. Springsteen himself has noted that \"Wreck on the Highway\" is one of the songs reflecting a shift in his songwriting style, linking The River to Nebraska.A slow-tempo song, \"Wreck on the Highway\" has not been particularly common in concert, with about 100 performances in Bruce Springsteen concerts through 2008.  Nearly all of those performances occurred during the 1980\u20131981 River Tour. The song was revived occasionally for electric piano performances on the 2005 solo Devils & Dust Tour.

Heylin also described the song as Springsteen's \"semi-ironic farewell to albums about cars and girls.\"  Music critic Dave Marsh describes the song as an appropriate closer for The River as it \"pares down the situation from 'Drive All Night'\" of the singer and his lover trying to ignore the distractions around them down \"to one man facing the world again.\"  To Marsh, the singer in \"Wreck on the Highway\" may well have been the hero from other songs on The River such as \"Ramrod,\" \"Cadillac Ranch,\" \"The River\" or \"Stolen Car,\" or even the heroes from earlier Springsteen albums such as Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town, but regardless Marsh feels that \"he sees and speaks and sings for all of them.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_22829", "text": "According to authors Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon:\nBruce Springsteen \u2013 vocals, guitars\nRoy Bittan \u2013 piano\nClarence Clemons \u2013 tambourine\nDanny Federici \u2013 organ\nGarry Tallent \u2013 bass\nSteven Van Zandt \u2013 guitars\nMax Weinberg \u2013 drums", "hasanswer": false}]}

The song features the only drum solo recorded by Ringo Starr with the Beatles.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_22834", "text": "McCartney said, \"I wanted [the medley] to end with a little meaningful couplet, so I followed the Bard and wrote a couplet.\" In his 1980 interview with Playboy, John Lennon acknowledged McCartney's authorship by saying, \"That's Paul again ... He had a line in it, 'And in the end, the love you get is equal to the love you give,' which is a very cosmic, philosophical line. Which again proves that if he wants to, he can think.\" Lennon misquoted the line; the actual words are, \"And in the end, the love you take, is equal to the love you make...\"Recording began on 23 July 1969, when the Beatles recorded a one-minute, thirty-second master take that was extended via overdubs to two minutes and five seconds. At this point, the song was called \"Ending\". The first vocals for the song were added on 5 August, additional vocals and guitar overdubs were added on 7 August, and bass and drums on 8 August, the day the Abbey Road cover picture was taken. Orchestral overdubs were added on 15 August, and the closing piano and accompanying vocal on 18 August.\nAll four Beatles have a solo in \"The End\", including a Ringo Starr drum solo. Starr disliked solos, preferring to cater drum work to whoever sang in a particular performance, and in fact this is the only drum solo Starr recorded with the Beatles. His solo on \"The End\" was recorded with twelve microphones around his drum kit; in his playing, he said he copied part of Ron Bushy's drumming on the Iron Butterfly track \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\". The take in which Starr performed the solo originally had guitar and tambourine accompaniment, but other instruments were muted during mixing, giving the effect of a drum solo.McCartney, George Harrison and Lennon perform a rotating sequence of three, two-bar guitar solos. The idea for a guitar instrumental over this section was Harrison's, and Lennon suggested that the three of them each play a section. The solos begin approximately 53 seconds into the song. Geoff Emerick, the Beatles' recording engineer, later recalled: \"John, Paul and George looked like they had gone back in time, like they were kids again, playing together for the sheer enjoyment of it. More than anything, they reminded me of gunslingers, with their guitars strapped on, looks of steely-eyed resolve, determined to outdo one another. Yet there was no animosity, no tension at all \u2013 you could tell they were simply having fun.\"The first two bars are played by McCartney, the second two by Harrison, the third two by Lennon, and then the sequence repeats twice. Each has a distinctive style which McCartney felt reflected their personalities. Immediately after Lennon's third solo, the piano chords of the final line \"And in the end ...\" begin. Then the orchestration arrangement takes over with a humming chorus and Harrison playing a final guitar solo that ends the song.\n\"The End\" was initially intended to be the final track on Abbey Road, but it ended up being followed by \"Her Majesty\". Although \"The End\" stands as the last known new recording involving all four members of the Beatles, one additional song, \"I Me Mine\", was recorded by three members of the group (Lennon being absent due to having privately left in September 1969) in January 1970 for the album Let It Be.\nThe 1996 compilation album Anthology 3 contains a remixed version of \"The End\", restoring tambourine and guitar overdubs mixed out of the original, and edited to emphasise the guitar solos and orchestral overdub. The track is followed by a variant on the long piano chord that ends \"A Day in the Life\", concluding the compilation. The drum solo was later used at the beginning of \"Get Back\" on the 2006 album Love.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_22835", "text": "The song commences in A major, with an initial I\u2013IV\u2013II\u2013V\u2013I structure matching the vocals on \"Oh, yeah, all right!\" This is followed by a \u266fiv\u2009dim\u2013I pattern (D\u266fdim to A chord) on \"dreams tonight.\" During this, the accompanying bass and one guitar move chromatically from A to B and D\u266f, while the second guitar harmonises a minor third higher to reach F\u266f. An eight-bar drum solo as a final statement of recognition to their \"steady, solid drummer\" ends with a crescendo of eighth notes and bass and rhythm guitar in seventh chords to the chant \"Love you.\" The sequential three guitar solos rotate through I7 (A7 chord)\u2013IV7 (D7 chord) changes in the key of A in a mix of \"major and minor pentatonic scales with slides, double-stops, repeated notes, low-bass string runs and wailing bends\".

The second time through, Paul answers John's bluesy flattened 7ths with bluesy minor thirds and then proceeds to echo George's earlier line, spiraling up to that same high D; George responds with some minor thirds of his own, while mimicking the choppy rhythm of John's part; John then drops two octaves to unleash a growling single-note line. On this final two-bar solo, Paul plays almost nothing but minor thirds and flattened sevenths in a herky-jerky rhythm that ends with a sudden plunge to a low A; George then reaches for the stars with a steeply ascending line that is pitched an octave above any notes heard so far; and John finishes with a string of insistent and heavily distorted 4ths, phrased in triplets, that drag behind the beat and grate against the background harmony.\nThe final \"Ah\" is in C with a spiritually evocative Plagal cadence IV\u2013I (F\u2013C chord) on piano while the voices do an F to E shift. \"And in the end the love you take\" is in A major, but the G/A chord supporting the word \"love\" begins to dissolve the listener's certainty that the chord is in A, by adding a \u266dVII.

For his next release Phillips committed to a full, standard album, his first since 1984 (1981). At this point in his career, Phillips was pressured by management at his record label, the independent US-based Passport Records, to deliver more commercial and radio friendly songs. Also in early 1982, he had bought a house in Clapham, south London and has since called Invisible Men his \"mortgage album\". He set up studio in his home which he named Englewood Studios, and did additional recording in Atmosphere Studios in central London. To help him with the project, Phillips invited musician and songwriter Richard Scott to assist in its production. In a later interview, Phillips acknowledged Scott's confidence and enthusiasm, but noted that this would sometimes result in Phillips being pushed into musical areas where he was uneasy, perhaps due to Scott's inexperience, having recently graduated from university and wanting to make a career out of music. When it came to the vocals, Phillips was inspired to take them on himself as former Genesis band mates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks had done vocals on their solo albums, and that he was unable to find someone suitable. Phillips had used different guest singers on Sides (1979), but felt that it did not work as well as he had expected. Feeling his vocals were inadequate, Phillips took singing lessons from John Owen-Edwards, who had worked with him on a musical project and had also coached Rutherford.After the backing tracks and rough vocals had been put down for about five songs, Phillips presented his work to his manager Tony Smith and recalled that he was \"extremely impressed\". This was when Phillips was enthusiastic about the album until it became increasingly difficult for him to maintain such a level of interest. During recording at Atmosphere Studios, session drummers were brought in to play parts originally programmed on a drum machine as well as singers for additional vocals. Phillips wrote about this period: \"The money was flowing out. It wasn't a wholly happy time.\" In addition, pressure was placed upon him to change his image and to present the album under the name Anthony Phillips Band, something with which he did not agree.Invisible Men was cut by Ian Cooper at Townhouse Studios in London. Phillips encountered problems in finalising the album's release in the US as Passport rejected two cuts that Cooper had prepared, coupled with the opinion that none of the songs were suitable for a single. After the second cut was rejected, Phillips recalled that Cooper \"was a bit beside himself - he just didn't know what else to do\", and received notes from the label's engineer in New York with suggestions to improve it, with which Phillips expressed some disagreement.

Kooper had recently left Blood, Sweat & Tears after they recorded their debut album, and was now working as an A&R man for Columbia Records. Bloomfield was about to leave the Electric Flag, and at a loose end. Kooper telephoned Bloomfield to see if he was free to come down to the studio and jam; Bloomfield agreed, leaving Kooper to handle the arrangements.Kooper booked two days of studio time at CBS Columbia Square in Los Angeles in May 1968, and recruited keyboardist Barry Goldberg and bassist Harvey Brooks, both members of the Electric Flag, along with well-known session drummer \"Fast\" Eddie Hoh. On the first day, the quintet recorded a group of mostly blues-based instrumental tracks. It included the modal excursion \"His Holy Modal Majesty\", which was a tribute to modal jazz musician John Coltrane, who had died the previous year, and was also reminiscent of \"East-West\" from the second Butterfield Blues Band album. On the second day, with the tapes ready to roll, Bloomfield returned to his home in Mill Valley in the San Francisco Bay Area, saying he had been unable to sleep.Needing to have something to show for the second day of booked studio time, Kooper hastily called upon Stephen Stills, also in the process of leaving his band, Buffalo Springfield, to replace Bloomfield. Regrouping behind Stills, Kooper's session men cut mostly vocal tracks, including \"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\" from Highway 61 and a lengthy and atmospheric take of \"Season of the Witch\" by Donovan. Although Harvey Brooks's closing \"Harvey's Tune\" includes overdubbed horns added in New York City while the album was being mixed, the album only cost $13,000 to complete.\n\nThe success of the album opened the door for the \"supergroup\" concept of the late 1960s and 1970s, as exemplified by the likes of Blind Faith and Crosby, Stills & Nash.

The notable black metal elements on the album include the high-pitched shrieking vocals of Peter Espevoll, some black metal tremolo riffs, such as on \"Innbydelse\", and the slightly raw sound production. However, the album's overall atmosphere is not particularly dark or cold; on several songs the soundscape contains happy sounding elements such as the cheerful power metal vocals of the guitarist Ole B\u00f8rud, creating tensions between the darker elements.\nThe musical output of Burial is a combination of power metal, old school death metal and traditional heavy metal, and the latter style is especially apparent on the main riff of \"Renhetens Elv\". Additionally, the songs contain interludes that include elements of industrial music, such as on the song \"Justified\", jazz and classical music, such as on the song \"Tears of Bitterness\". The guest musician Maria Riddervold played violin on the songs \"Embraced\" and \"Tears of Bitterness\". The musicianship on Burial is virtuoisic, taking the style a step towards technical death metal and progressive death metal, technically exceptionally precise, and contains experimental, bizarre song structures. One critic wrote that the album's style \"varies from extremely aggressive discharges to beautiful guitar harmonies, while the main focus relies on twisted riffs and ferocious directions.\" While most of the tracks are in English, three songs are written in Norwegian; \"Renhetens Elv\" (\"The River of Purity\"), \"Innbydelse\" (\"Invitation\"), and \"Jesus Kom Til Jorden For \u00c5 D\u00f8\" (\"Jesus Came to World to Die\"), the latter notable as a hymn-like, doom metal-esque and folkish piece arranged by Arnold B\u00f8rud, who also played the organs on the song.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23024", "text": "During the time Burial was released, Extol was described as Norway's second best band by the Norwegian magazine Scream.

It was released worldwide on March 8, 2011 through RCA Records. Recording sessions for the album began in November 2008 and continued over a period of nearly two years, concluding in October 2010. Goodbye Lullaby is a primarily a pop rock album and is considered a more introspective record from Lavigne in comparison to her previous material, consisting mainly of stripped down instruments such as the piano and acoustic guitar. Lavigne assumed an integral role in the album's production and co-wrote every original track on Goodbye Lullaby, as well as collaborating with several producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Butch Walker, and her ex-husband Deryck Whibley. Goodbye Lullaby is Lavigne's third and final studio album with RCA, following The Best Damn Thing (2007) and Under My Skin (2004)\nUpon its release, Goodbye Lullaby received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with some naming it her most personal and introspective album while others took issue with its subdued sound and Lavigne's lyrical content. The album debuted inside the top five in over 15 countries such as the United States and Canada (where it has since been certified gold) and topping the charts in over eight countries, such as Australia, Greece, Hong Kong and Japan.\nGoodbye Lullaby had sold 1.5 million copies worldwide as of 2013. Three singles were released from Goodbye Lullaby. \"What the Hell\" was released as the lead single in January 2011 and achieved worldwide chart success, reaching the top 20 in the United States and United Kingdom, the top ten in Europe and Australia and the top five in Asia. The following singles, \"Smile\" and \"Wish You Were Here\", had moderate chart success worldwide.

In September 2009, it was reported that Lavigne and husband Deryck Whibley were separating. The same day, MTV News reported that he was working with her on the follow-up album to The Best Damn Thing. They used their home studio to produce eight of the nine tracks she initially recorded for the album. \"I think this is taking the spirit of what she's done on previous records so much further,\" he said. \"It's way more meaningful, has more of an impact, more emotional. It makes me feel something more than the other stuff. And I wanted to match that musically with the track.\"The album and lead single's release dates had been pushed back several times. The album was originally scheduled for release on November 17, 2009. Later, in January 2010, Lavigne stated that the album cover had been photographed and the first single would be released in April followed by the album in June. In May, Lavigne said that she considered the album too serious and \"mellow\" and would return to the studio to balance the album out, \"With an album, I don't want to rush it out.... I have a very serious record, so I think I need to put a couple upbeat, fun songs on it.\" In August 2010, Lavigne returned to Henson Recording Studios with producer Alex da Kid. During these sessions, Lavigne had strep throat, and the people involved were required to wear surgical masks. Despite her doctor's warning, Lavigne recorded vocals, \"I wasn't able to sing for the last forty-eight hours because I could do permanent damage to the vocal cords.\" She revealed that she had been \"trying new stuff\" and that she was \"exploring\". Lavigne added that she had enough material for two records.In October 2010, Lavigne was featured in Maxim for the November issue. During the interview she revealed that she had finished Goodbye Lullaby after two and a half years. However, in November, Lavigne announced that her album had been completed for a year, citing her record company as the reason for the album's delays. Lavigne stated that her record company wanted something more upbeat to keep up with mainstream radio, \"Radio's very rhythmic and urban and dance today.

To help promote her first fragrance, Black Star, Lavigne needed a short theme that would be used for the TV spots. \"Black Star\" was composed in a Malaysian hotel during her tour. The jingle was eventually expanded into a short introduction to the album. Recording began with minimal instruments, usually starting with Lavigne singing only to acoustic guitar, with additional instruments added later. Lavigne stated that her vocals were the most important instrument to her during the album's recording, \"Typically the lead vocal gets buried in the track and you can't always hear the quality, character, or emotion after a certain point. I wanted my voice to be the main instrument.\"Lavigne described the process: \"It's stripped down. I love performing that way, so I really felt like it was time to make a record like that. To just make it all about the vocal and the performance, and the vibe, and the emotion.\" Because she has a studio in her home, Lavigne was able to compose and record at her leisure. She also used the piano to compose the majority of the songs. \"The piano is more of an emotional instrument. It stirs up different emotions for me and moves me in a different way than the guitar can.\" By July 2009, nine tracks had been recorded, including the songs \"Fine\", \"Everybody Hurts\" and \"Darlin'\", the latter being the second song Lavigne wrote as a 15-year-old while living in Napanee, Ontario. Lavigne stated that this album would be different from her previous work, \"The other albums I've done, the songs are all over the place. This is the most consistent album all the way through.\"In addition to working with Deryck Whibley in the majority of the songs, Lavigne also produced two songs on her own and worked with Max Martin and Shellback. \"What was really great about working with Max was, I flew out to Sweden for a couple weeks, sat down, played him my record, got to know each other, wrote some songs together, and then I was out,\" she told MTV News. \"It switched it up for me. It was a new creative space, a new relationship, and we got a lot done. He's very talented.\" Lavigne's longtime collaborators Evan Taubenfield and Butch Walker co-wrote and produced some of the tracks as well. In November 2010, British producer Alex da Kid, who worked with Lavigne beginning in August 2010, stated that some songs on the album will have a hip-hop sound, \"We've got some things that are hip-hop leaning, and we've got some things that are more pop/rock leaning\".

Lavigne described the album as being about how we all go through difficult experiences, whether it's ending a relationship, losing a job, or just missing someone. She stated, \"It's so easy for me to do a boy-bashing pop song, but to sit down and write honestly about something that's really close to me, something I've been through, it's a totally different thing.\" The album serves as a return to Lavigne's older musical style and is largely acoustic. With the exception of the album's lead single, Lavigne describes the songs on the album as different from her earlier material, \"I'm older now, so I think that comes across in my music, it's not as pop-rock and it's a little more mellow and it's deep\". She said, \"[For] this record, I just really, really wanted to sing.... I just wanna have silence around me, and have these acoustic songs and really deliver.\" For Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, \"these mellow acoustic songs paint a mournful, lamenting picture of a woman trying to sort through why her marriage failed.\"The album opens with the intro \"Black Star\", which lasts for 1 minute and 34 seconds, and was described by Rolling Stone as \"an ethereal lullaby that turns epic with tinkling Coldplay-like pianos and soaring strings.\" The second track and first single off the album, \"What the Hell\", was described by Lavigne herself as \"a broad message about personal freedom\", calling it her \"most pop track on the record\", the least personal song from the album and the song most reminiscent of her previous work. In \"Push\", she forcefully tells a guy to stop complaining about how hard it can be to make a relationship work, while the power ballad \"Wish You Were Here\" shows Lavigne's vulnerable side, and according to Spin's Mikael Wood, \"talks about her recent divorce from Deryck Whibley\". The other upbeat, pop rock track \"Smile\", finds Lavigne referring to herself as a \"crazy bitch\" and expressing her gratitude for special people in her life. The sixth track \"Stop Standing There\", written only by herself, has been described as having an \"early- '50s girl-group feel\", while lyrically it finds Lavigne imploring a hesitant suitor to confess his affection.The seventh track \"I Love You\" fondly reminisces about how Avril loved getting drunk with her ex, among other things, while \"Everybody Hurts\" ponders why things turned out as they have and longs for a second chance. For Andy Greenwald of Entertainment Weekly, \"Not Enough\" is a raw confessional track, while \"4 Real\", written and produced by herself, concerns about authenticity in a lover, with Lavigne insisting that her partner be \"4 real,\" because everything feels right. Acoustic guitar and piano, as well as an orchestra are used in \"Darlin'\", \"Remember When\" and \"Goodbye\". \"Darlin'\" was written when Lavigne was 14 years old. \"Whenever I hear 'Darlin,' I think of the family room I wrote it in and playing it for my mom,\" she says. \"So it's really special for me to have it on the album.\" \"Remember When\" realizes that the breaking of what's supposed to be an eternal bond has serious emotional consequences as it captures the ache of post-divorce loneliness. The final track \"Goodbye\" talks about finding the strength to close one chapter of her life and move on to the next. Lavigne stated that it was the most personal song she has ever wrote and was the inspiration for the album's title.

It peaked at No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 20 on the US Billboard 200.\nBefore the album's release, the Thompson Twins performed at Live Aid in July 1985, where they revealed their new material by playing a rock-oriented version of the Beatles' song \"Revolution\". The band were also joined onstage for this number by Nile Rodgers (who co-produced the album), Madonna, and guitarist Steve Stevens, perhaps best known for his work with Billy Idol.\nAlthough the album was a chart success in the UK and the US, it was considerably less successful than their previous studio album Into the Gap (1984).

Sadkin had produced the last two Thompson Twins studio albums, which were the band's biggest commercial successes to date, and the new single climbed to No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart. However, the band subsequently decided to part company with Sadkin and set about working on the new studio album with Bailey taking sole responsibility as producer at Marcadet Studios in Paris, using a 3M digital 32-track recorder. It was there that most of the backing tracks were put together.\nIn March 1985, with the album nearing completion and the next single \"Roll Over\" just about to be released in the UK, Tom Bailey suddenly fell ill. After collapsing in his hotel room, he was diagnosed with nervous exhaustion and ordered to rest by doctors. The incident prompted the band to recall all copies of \"Roll Over\", despite the fact that some of them had already been shipped to retail outlets. Bailey then took time off in Barbados to recuperate. Holding off on the album's release led the band to reconsider the entire project, and they began work on it again following Bailey's recovery. This time they enlisted Nile Rodgers to co-produce and help salvage the project at Bailey's suggestion, after having met him in New York during the break and discovering how well they both got on creatively. The new recordings were more strongly oriented toward the use of electric guitars.\nFrom early June to early August 1985, additional overdubs and mixing of Here's to Future Days took place at Skyline Studios in New York City with Rodgers assisting as co-producer; the only two major interruptions to recording were the US Independence day celebrations on 4 July and Live Aid on 13 July. Since the band had recorded on more than 24 tracks, two synchronized 24-track tape machines were used for transferring the Marcadet recordings. Concerning the use of electric guitars, Bailey commented:\n\n \"I knew before we went into the studio for this album that we'd avoided guitars for long enough, and that now was the time to use them. It was almost as if I wanted to make something that was more of a rock album and less of an electronic pop one.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the three Godfather films, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Michael was portrayed by Al Pacino, for which he was twice-nominated for Academy Awards. Michael is the youngest son of Vito Corleone, a Sicilian immigrant who builds a Mafia empire. Upon his father's death, Michael succeeds him as the don of the Corleone crime family.\nIn June 2003, Michael Corleone was recognized as the 11th most iconic villain in film history by the American Film Institute, although some critics consider him to be a tragic hero. The British film magazine Empire selected Michael Corleone as the 11th greatest movie character, with Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone widely regarded as one of the greatest performances in cinematic history.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_23242", "text": "In his novel The Godfather, Mario Puzo introduces Michael with the following physical description: \u201cHe did not have the heavy, Cupid-shaped face of [his siblings], and his jet black hair was straight rather than curly. His skin was a clear olive-brown that would have been called beautiful in a girl. He was handsome in a delicate way.\u201d Later in the novel, Puzo writes, \u201cMichael was not tall or heavily built but his presence seemed to radiate danger.\u201dUnlike his two older brothers, Michael wants nothing to do with the Corleone \"family business\", wanting instead to lead a more Americanized life. Vito does not want Michael to join the Corleone criminal empire either, hoping that his favorite son would go into politics. Michael was enrolled at Dartmouth College, but dropped out to enlist in the United States Marine Corps the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. During World War II, he fights in the Pacific War, and is wounded in battle. For his bravery, he received a battlefield commission to the rank of Lieutenant, and was awarded the Silver Star and the Navy Cross. He was discharged as a Captain after V-J Day in the fall of 1945. His heroics during the war were featured in Life magazine.\nDuring the autumn of 1945, Michael is discharged from the Marines, unaware that Vito secretly arranged for his discharge, using his political influence. Michael returns home to attend his sister Connie's wedding, accompanied by Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), his college sweetheart. Michael stays for a few weeks, intending to re-enter college without telling his family.\nJust before Christmas 1945, Vito is critically wounded in an assassination attempt by drug kingpin Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), pushing a reluctant Michael into the Mafia world he has avoided for so long. Arriving at the hospital, he finds his bedridden father unprotected from potential attack. While awaiting Corleone reinforcements, Michael prevents a second assassination attempt on Vito by Sollozzo, then affirms his loyalty to his father. Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), a corrupt NYPD captain on Sollozzo's payroll, breaks Michael's jaw before more Corleone button men arrive.\nAs Vito Corleone recuperates, Sollozzo requests that Michael broker a truce, but acting boss Sonny, suspecting a trap, refuses and demands the other Mafia families hand over Sollozzo to the Corleone family or else face war. Michael volunteers to meet Sollozzo in a public place and kill him and McCluskey. Hagen warns that killing McCluskey would violate a long-standing Mafia rule not to kill police officers, and says it would incite deadly backlash from rival Mafia families and law enforcement. Michael argues they can publicly expose McCluskey as a corrupt cop involved in the drug trade and serving as Sollozzo's bodyguard, contending that McCluskey has crossed into their world and is fair game. Sonny agrees and approves the hit.\nAfter careful preparation, Michael meets with Sollozzo and McCluskey at an Italian restaurant in The Bronx. He retrieves a handgun that Corleone caporegime Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano) had planted beforehand in the bathroom and kills Sollozzo and McCluskey by shooting them at point-blank range. This ignites the New York underworld's first Mafia war in a decade.\nMichael escapes to Sicily and spends two years under Corleone ally Don Tommasino's (Corrado Gaipa) protection. Michael falls in love with and marries a young local woman named Apollonia Vitelli (Simonetta Stefanelli). Back in the United States, Sonny is murdered. After Michael is notified of Sonny's murder, he and Apollonia prepare to move to Siracusa, but she is killed by a car bomb meant for Michael, proving the other Mafia families know where he is hiding.\nMichael returns to the United States in 1950 and assumes Sonny's role as Vito's heir apparent. After Vito's suspicions are confirmed that Don Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte), his main rival in New York City, is the mastermind of his shooting and Sonny's murder, he and Michael begin a secret, complex plot to wipe out the other New York Dons. They deliberately allow their rivals to whittle away at Corleone interests to lull them into inaction. Meanwhile, Michael convinces his father that it is time to remove the family from crime. More than a year following his return, Michael reunites with Kay and they marry. He promises her the Corleone family will be completely legitimate in five years. Within three years, they have two children, Anthony and Mary.\nVito semi-retires in 1954, and Michael becomes operating head of the family. He offers to buy out casino owner Moe Greene's (Alex Rocco) stake in the Las Vegas casino that the Corleones bankrolled, intending to move the family to Nevada as part of his effort to legitimize the Corleone interests; Greene refuses to sell. Corleone family caporegimes Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda) and Clemenza request permission to begin operating their own families in Corleone territory. Michael, with Vito's support, advises them to be patient and wait until the move to Las Vegas is completed. Tessio and Clemenza agree, but are clearly dissatisfied.\nIn 1955, Vito warns Michael that Barzini will likely attempt to assassinate Michael under the pretense of negotiating peace between the families, using a disloyal contact within the Corleone regime. Whoever approaches Michael about the meeting, Vito explains, will be the traitor within the family. Shortly thereafter, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with his grandson Anthony in his tomato garden.\nAt Vito's funeral, Tessio tells Michael that Barzini wants to arrange a meeting, confirming Vito's prediction. Michael sets his plan in motion to murder the other New York Mafia heads: Barzini, Philip Tattaglia (Victor Rendina), Carmine Cuneo (Rudy Bond), and Victor Stracci (Don Costello), as well as Greene. The plot unfolds on the same day Michael stands as godfather to Connie's newborn son. Later the same day, he has Tessio and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), Connie's abusive husband who conspired in Sonny's murder, executed. In one stroke, Michael re-establishes the Corleone family as the nation's most powerful crime family and establishes a reputation as being even more cunning and ruthless than his father.\nA few days later, Connie furiously accuses Michael of murdering Carlo. When challenged by Kay, Michael denies having ordered Carlo's murder. Kay, initially believing Michael, later observes him receiving his capos. Clemenza addresses Michael as \"Don Corleone\" and kisses his hand in the same manner that he did with Michael's father. Kay realizes Connie's accusations were true, and that Michael has become a powerful Don becoming his father's successor in every way.

The Corleone family has relocated to Nevada, while capo Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) runs the family's operations in New York, Clemenza having died a few years before. While Michael's many enemies and growing obsession with revenge keep him tethered to the criminal underworld, he still plans to finally legitimize the family by negotiating with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), his father's former business partner, over controlling casino operations in Cuba.\nHours after Anthony's First Communion party, assassins open fire on the Corleone house, nearly killing Michael and Kay. Michael suspects Roth ordered the hit, and believes a mole within the Corleone family aided him. To uncover Roth's involvement, Michael maintains their business relationship, and orders Pentangeli to settle a dispute with Roth's business partners, the Rosato Brothers. When Pentangeli meets with them, they try to kill him, but he survives.\nMichael, Roth, and Fredo travel to Cuba to forge a partnership with Fulgencio Batista allowing them to operate casinos in Cuba without interference in exchange for generous payments to the Cuban government. Michael sends his bodyguard to eliminate Roth on New Year's Eve, but Cuban soldiers kill the bodyguard during the attempt. That same night, Fredo unintentionally reveals that he was the mole within the family; Michael confronts Fredo and gives him the Sicilian \"kiss of death\". During the New Year's Eve festivities, victorious rebel forces enter Havana, forcing Batista into exile and ruining Michael's plans. Fredo, afraid of his brother, runs off, while Roth escapes to Miami.\nMeanwhile, Pentangeli, believing Michael had ordered a hit on him, prepares to testify against him in the Senate's investigation of organized crime. However, Michael has Pentangeli's brother Vincenzo (Salvatore Po) brought from Sicily. Just prior to the hearing, Vincenzo and Frank exchange glances. Understanding the threat, Pentangeli recants his earlier sworn statements, throwing the hearings into chaos and effectively destroying the government's case against Michael.\nFredo confesses to Michael that Roth's right-hand man, Johnny Ola (Dominic Chianese), had promised to reward him for information about Michael. Fredo also says that he resents being \"passed over\" to head the family in favor of Michael, and that he withheld key information about the Senate investigation. Michael disowns Fredo and tells his personal assassin Al Neri (Richard Bright) that nothing is to happen to his brother while their mother is alive \u2014 the implication being that Neri is to kill Fredo after she dies.\nMeanwhile, Kay decides to leave Michael and take their children with her, believing Michael will always live in a world of crime and violence. Michael asks her to reconsider, but Kay reveals she aborted their unborn son because she refused to bring another of his children into the world. Enraged, Michael hits Kay in the face and severs ties with her, taking custody of Anthony and Mary.\nFollowing their mother's death, and at Connie's behest, Michael seemingly forgives Fredo, but it is actually a ploy to draw him in closer in order to have him killed. Soon after, Neri murders Fredo on Michael's orders. At the same time, Michael sends Hagen to persuade Pentangeli to commit suicide to spare his family, and has caporegime Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui) kill a heavily guarded Roth at Idlewild Airport upon his return to the US.\nThe film ends as Michael recalls a surprise birthday party for his father on December 7, 1941. In a flashback scene, Michael informs the family that he has dropped out of college to enlist in the Marines. Only Fredo supports Michael's decision.

Michael has moved back to New York, abandoned the Nevada estate, and taken great strides to remove the family from crime.\nHe turns over his New York criminal interests to longtime enforcer Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna). Ridden with guilt over his ruthless rise to power, particularly his order to kill Fredo, Michael uses his great wealth to rehabilitate his reputation through numerous acts of charity, administered by a foundation named after his father.\nA decade earlier, he had given custody of his two children to Kay, who has since remarried. He sells his gambling interests to other Mafia families and reorganizes his vast legitimate business holdings as the \"Corleone Group\".\nThe Holy See has named him a Commander of the Order of Saint Sebastian for his charitable works and large donations to Catholic institutions.\nAt the ceremony, Michael and Kay have an uneasy reunion after nine years. Kay supports their son Anthony's (Franc D'Ambrosio) ambition to reject the \"family business\" and become an opera singer, and tells Michael that both she and Anthony know the truth about Fredo's death. Michael had previously wanted Anthony to either finish law school or join the family business, but now consents to Anthony going his own way.\nMichael's new connection to the Church provides an opportunity to take over the large property company, Immobiliare. He is already its largest shareholder, and offers to buy the Vatican's 25 percent share, which will give him controlling interest. He also takes in Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), a soldier in Zasa's crew, as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Nevertheless, Michael is distressed by Vincent's fiery temper, and disapproves of his romance with Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola).\nOn the night Michael announces he is dissolving his gambling empire, Zasa wipes out most of The Commission in a helicopter attack in Atlantic City. Michael escapes with help from Vincent and Neri. Michael realizes that his old friend Don Altobello (Eli Wallach) is the brains behind the attempt on his life. Traumatized by the attack, Michael suffers a diabetic stroke, briefly incapacitating him. (Francis Ford Coppola reveals in his audio commentary that Michael is frequently seen drinking water in the first two films\u2014subtle hints that he is a diabetic.) \nWith Michael still bedridden, Connie gives Vincent consent to assassinate Zasa. Disguised as an NYPD mounted officer, Vincent kills Zasa in the middle of an Italian street festival. Michael is infuriated upon learning of the hit, and demands that no similar orders be issued while he is alive.\nMichael returns to Sicily for Anthony's operatic debut at the Teatro Massimo. Suspecting that Altobello may make another attempt on his life, he has Vincent infiltrate Altobello's regime under the pretense of defecting.\nMichael and Kay tour Sicily together, during which Michael asks for Kay's forgiveness. Kay admits she will always love him, and they begin to rekindle their relationship.\nMeanwhile, the Immobiliare deal has stalled, supposedly because the critically ill Pope Paul VI must personally approve it. Michael learns that the Immobiliare deal is an elaborate swindle concocted by Immobiliare chairman Licio Lucchesi (Enzo Robutti), who schemed with Vatican Bank head Archbishop Gilday (Donal Donnelly) and accountant Frederick Keinszig (Helmut Berger) to embezzle a fortune from the Vatican Bank, using Michael's \"investment\" to cover their tracks. Hoping to salvage the deal, Michael seeks Don Tommasino's assistance. He directs Michael to Cardinal Lamberto (Raf Vallone), the future Pope John Paul I. With Lamberto's prodding, Michael makes his first confession in 30 years, tearfully breaking down as he admits to ordering Fredo's murder. Lamberto tells Michael he deserves to suffer for his terrible sins, but that there is hope for his redemption.\nJohn Paul I dies soon after being elected pope, poisoned by Gilday. Michael learns that Altobello (in league with the conspirators) has hired an assassin named Mosca (Mario Donatone) to kill him. Mosca murders Tommasino, and Michael vows before his old friend's casket to sin no more. Vincent reports that Lucchesi, working with Altobello, is behind the assassination attempts on Michael.\nWeary of the bloody, lonely life of a Don, Michael retires, making Vincent his successor, but not before giving him permission to retaliate. In return, Vincent agrees to end his relationship with Mary. That night, Michael, reconciled with Kay and Anthony, watches his son's performance in the opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Meanwhile, Vincent has Lucchesi, Gilday, and Keinszig murdered, while Connie murders Altobello with a poisoned cannoli.\nAfter the performance, Mosca shoots Michael, wounding him, and a second bullet hits Mary, killing her.

Rubin commissioned new songs from several musicians, two of which ended up on American Recordings. \"Down There By The Train\" was a spiritual or gospel style song of redemption by Tom Waits. \"Thirteen\" was a more ominous composition by Glenn Danzig, whose heavy metal band had earlier worked with Rubin; Danzig wrote the song specifically for Cash in less than twenty minutes.Two songs on the album had been recorded by Cash previously: \"Delia's Gone\", for the 1962 album The Sound of Johnny Cash and \"Oh, Bury Me Not\", for 1965's Johnny Cash Sings the Ballads of the True West.\nThe album cover was photographed while Cash was visiting Australia, at Werribee near Melbourne.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23273", "text": "American Recordings received nearly universal acclaim from critics.

In a rave review in Rolling Stone, Anthony DeCurtis hailed it as one of Cash's greatest albums because of his self-possessed, \"biblically intense\" take on traditional folk songs and Rubin's no-frills production: \"American Recordings is at once monumental and viscerally intimate, fiercely true to the legend of Johnny Cash and entirely contemporary.\" Mark Cooper from Mojo called it a \"breathtaking blend of the confessional and the self-mythologising\". In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot wrote that Cash's singing was effectively dramatic throughout \"the quagmire of humor and bloodshed, pathos and treachery evoked by these songs\", while Los Angeles Times critic Randy Lewis said they \"peer into the dark corners of the American soul\" on what was a \"milestone work\" for Cash.AllMusic's Mark Deming wrote that the album \"became a critical sensation and a commercial success, though it was overrated in some quarters simply because it reminded audiences that one of America's greatest musical talents was still capable of making compelling music, something he had never stopped doing even if no one bothered to listen.\"At the end of 1994, American Recordings was voted the seventh best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide.

It was produced by Danger Mouse, with additional production from Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The album was announced at an Apple Inc. product launch event and released the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. It was exclusive to iTunes, iTunes Radio, and Beats Music until 13 October 2014, when it received a physical release on Island and Interscope Records. The digital release made the record available to more than 500 million iTunes customers, for what Apple CEO Tim Cook marketed as \"the largest album release of all time\".\nAfter the relatively lukewarm commercial performance of their previous record, No Line on the Horizon (2009), lead singer Bono expressed uncertainty about the band's ability to remain musically relevant. During the five-and-a-half-year gestation period for Songs of Innocence\u2014the longest gap between albums of their career\u2014the group reportedly worked on several projects with multiple producers, including an aborted companion to their previous record called Songs of Ascent. However, they struggled to complete an album to their satisfaction and continually delayed a release. After working with Danger Mouse for two years, the group collaborated with Flood, Epworth, and Tedder to complete Songs of Innocence. Thematically, it revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to musical inspirations Ramones and the Clash. Bono described it as \"the most personal album we've written\".\nThe lead single \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)\" was featured in an Apple television advertisement as part of a promotional campaign for the band on which the company reportedly spent US$100 million. Approximately 81 million iTunes users listened to the album in its first month of release, 26 million of whom downloaded the entire record. Songs of Innocence received generally mixed reviews and drew criticism for its digital release; the album was automatically added to users' iTunes accounts, which for many triggered an unprompted download to their electronic devices. Upon its commercial release, Songs of Innocence sold just 101,000 copies in North America and charted for just eight and nine weeks in the US and UK, respectively. The group's press tour for the album was interrupted after Bono was seriously injured in a bicycle accident. The record received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Album.

Having spent time in Fez, Morocco, recording and absorbing exotic musical influences, the group intended the record to be more experimental than their previous two. However, critics found it to be more conventional than expected. During the five-and-a-half-year gestation period for Songs of Innocence, lead singer Bono expressed uncertainty on several occasions that U2 could remain relevant musically after the relatively lukewarm commercial performance of No Line on the Horizon.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23340", "text": "According to music journalist Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production \"puts a higher gloss, and sometimes a heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound\". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as \"the most personal album we've written\". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, \"Let's try to figure out why we wanted to be in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys\u2014first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually.\" He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he wanted to be in a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, \"The person you need to be to make the album that you wanna make is a long way from where you live.\" Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, a notion that Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration.\n\nOpening track \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)\" pays tribute to Joey Ramone, the Ramones' lead singer who was particularly influential on Bono. During their teenage years, U2 snuck into a Ramones concert, and the experience of watching Joey perform made Bono feel less self-conscious about his own singing. \"Every Breaking Wave\" is about the difficulty of \"giv[ing] yourself completely to another person\", with lyrical characters who are \"addicted to sort of failure and rebirth\". \"California (There Is No End to Love)\" recalls the group's first visit to Los Angeles and how the city contrasted with their native Dublin. \"Song for Someone\" is a love song Bono wrote for his wife Ali Hewson, who he met during their teenage years. \"Iris (Hold Me Close)\" is written about Bono's mother, Iris, who died after suffering a cerebral aneurysm at her father's funeral when Bono was 14 years old. The lyrics liken her influence over her son to a star that died long ago but whose light is still reaching earth. Bono rewrote the song's lyrics after reading a letter that journalist James Foley wrote in captivity to his family prior to his being killed by ISIS; the letters made Bono realize that \"we will all be remembered by the least-profound moments. The simplest moments.\"The lyrics for \"Volcano\" are written from the perspective of a younger Bono addressing his modern-day self; he said, \"It's this young guy going, 'The fuck happened to you?'\" The Edge composed the song's bass intro. \"Raised by Wolves\" is about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, which killed 33 people but were narrowly avoided by Bono that day. The song is written from the perspective of Andy Rowen (brother of Bono's childhood friend Guggi), whose presence at the bombings would later drive him into heroin addiction, a subject also addressed in U2's 1984 song \"Bad\". \"Cedarwood Road\" reminisces about the street in Dublin on which Bono lived during his youth. The cherry blossom tree referenced in the lyrics was from the Rowen family garden. \"Sleep Like a Baby Tonight\", written about a pedophile priest, was described by Q's Tom Doyle as featuring \"deceptively lullaby-like... synth pulses\" reminiscent of Kraftwerk. Their album The Man-Machine was gifted by Bono to Ali when they were dating as teenagers and is name-checked in \"Iris (Hold Me Close)\" in the line, \"But it was you who made me your man/Machine\". \"This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now\" takes musical cues from one of the group's childhood inspirations, the Clash; according to the liner notes, the song is dedicated to the Clash's guitarist/vocalist Joe Strummer. The lyrics were inspired by Bono's realisation that he had found a new family and home in the form of U2, having felt like his childhood house was no longer home after his mother's death. The closing track, \"The Troubles\", was described by Bono as \"an uncomfortable song about domestic violence\".The deluxe editions of the album feature two additional songs. \"Lucifer's Hands\" is based on an instrumental piece titled \"Return of the Stingray Guitar\" that U2 debuted live in 2010 and performed as the opening song at each of their 32 concerts that year. \"The Crystal Ballroom\" is written about the former Dublin nightclub of the same name (later known as McGonagle's) where the band frequently performed in their early years. Lyrically, Bono imagines himself on-stage at the venue witnessing his parents dancing in the audience.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23341", "text": "The album art for iTunes copies of the album was created by MAD Agency London to resemble white label packaging commonly used for promotional LP record pressings.

The image was taken by photographer Glen Luchford initially as an experiment, but the group thought it worked as a visual metaphor for the album and its theme of \"how holding on to your own innocence is a lot harder than holding on to someone else's\". Bono said, \"With this record we were looking for the raw, naked and personal, to strip everything back.\" According to Bono, the tattoo on Mullen's upper arm is based on Native American mythology of the Pawnee tribe and is a symbol of protecting innocence. The cover parallels those of the band's earlier albums, Boy (1980) and War (1983), which featured the face of a young boy, Peter Rowen, the younger brother of Guggi.The album's title, along with that of the group's 2017 follow-up, Songs of Experience, are taken from William Blake's collection of poems Songs of Innocence and of Experience.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23342", "text": "In the days leading up to an Apple product launch event on 9 September 2014 in Cupertino, California, rumours circulated that U2 would be involved. A spokesperson for the band denied reports that they would perform at the event or that a new album would come preloaded on the anticipated new iPhone 6 smartphone. During the event, after the unveiling of the new iPhone and Apple Watch, U2 appeared on-stage and performed a new song entitled \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)\". Afterwards, Apple CEO Tim Cook joined them to make a surprise announcement that their 13th studio album, Songs of Innocence, had been completed and would be digitally released that day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. Bono called the album \"a gift [from Apple]... to all their music customers\", and said that the group wanted to \"get [the album] to as many people as possible, because that's what our band is all about\". The record was automatically added to the \"purchased\" section of users' iTunes music libraries. It was exclusive to iTunes and the streaming services iTunes Radio and Beats Music until 13 October 2014, when it was physically released and the no-cost promotion within the iTunes Store lapsed. The Edge called the album launch: \"incredibly subversive. It's really punk rock, it's really disruptive.\" Songs of Innocence was made available to more than 500 million iTunes customers in 119 countries, for what Cook marketed as \"the largest album release of all time\".Bono rejected the notion that U2 had given the album away at no cost, saying: \"We were paid. I don't believe in free music. Music is a sacrament.\" Apple reportedly paid a lump sum to the band and Universal Music Group (UMG) for a five-week exclusivity window in which to distribute Songs of Innocence. According to Billboard's estimates, Apple could have paid either US$52 million to UMG for exclusive rights to the album based on the quantity of downloads, or an upfront fee of about $5 million excluding royalties. In addition, Apple agreed to a marketing campaign for the album reportedly worth around $100 million, which kicked off with a television advertisement featuring \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)\". Apple's partnership with U2 dates back to 2004; in promotion of the band's album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, its first single, \"Vertigo\", was featured in an internationally aired iPod television advertisement, while a U2 iPod and an iTunes-exclusive U2 digital box set were also released. The release of Songs of Innocence drew comparisons to that of two 2013 records: Jay-Z's Magna Carta Holy Grail, which was sponsored by Samsung; and Beyonc\u00e9's self-titled album, which also was released without any prior promotion or notice.To placate physical retailers affected by the digital exclusivity period, Universal offered them a deluxe version of Songs of Innocence that contains four additional songs, along with several acoustic versions of the record's songs. The bonus tracks were exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores and music streaming services for five weeks. The iTunes Store then released the ten deluxe edition tracks under the title Songs of Innocence + on 18 November 2014. Retailers also received catalogue deals that discounted U2's albums in stores by $3 for a period of time. A Grammy Awards spokesperson initially said the album would not be eligible for consideration at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards because it would not have been available for purchase prior to the 30 September eligibility deadline. However, the ruling was reversed after UMG released a limited-edition vinyl pressing of the album to retailers on the cutoff date.The same day as Songs of Innocence's digital release, Irish public service broadcaster RT\u00c9 played the record in its entirety on RT\u00c9 2fm. This was in line with a long-standing tradition of U2 giving the station's DJ Dave Fanning the exclusive to play their new albums before any other broadcaster.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The band reconvened at The Hit Factory in New York City in November 2004 to begin work on their eighth studio album. The Hit Factory, a studio in which artists such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, Stevie Wonder, U2 and John Lennon had recorded, was earmarked for closure. Dream Theater was the last band to record at that original location before it was permanently closed.After writing the concept album Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory, the double album Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and the metal-focused Train of Thought, the band decided to create \"a classic Dream Theater album\". Keyboardist Jordan Rudess described it as \"really going back to creating a real band effort, as well as drawing upon all our various stylistic influences.\" On Octavarium, the band wanted to make the music less complex, featuring songs which Rudess regards as \"quicker to appreciate\", although noted that the twenty-four-minute \"Octavarium\" was not as accessible. Guitarist John Petrucci noted that they wanted to focus on writing strong songs. To achieve this, the band stripped the sound down to piano, guitar and vocals when writing, focusing on the melodies and song structures.\nDrummer Mike Portnoy dismissed claims that Octavarium was an attempt to write a more commercial album, stating that the band simply \"[has] that side to [them]. We love bands like U2 or Coldplay, as well as liking shorter songs as well.\" Portnoy noted that, after writing Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and Train of Thought, they had not written an album of shorter songs for some time. He said that the band had found writing longer songs easier than writing shorter ones, and that the band was not trying to write a radio hit as \"the label wouldn't have done crap with it anyway.\"The band had previously written an orchestral-style piece in the form of \"Overture\" on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, but recorded it using keyboards. The tracks \"The Answer Lies Within\", \"Sacrificed Sons\" and \"Octavarium\" marked the first time Dream Theater worked with an orchestra, conducted by Jamshied Sharifi (who studied at Berklee College of Music at the same time as Portnoy, Petrucci and bassist John Myung). The orchestra was selected based on their sight reading ability, allowing all their parts to be recorded in a maximum of two takes, even though they had never seen or played the music before.Sharifi would later go on to conduct the Octavarium Orchestra on Dream Theater's Score album.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23375", "text": "When starting to work on what would become Octavarium, Portnoy noted that it would be their eighth studio album and that they had recently released their fifth live album, Live at Budokan. This sequence mirrored the octave on a musical keyboard: each octave contains eight naturals and five accidentals. Portnoy suggested that they use that concept for the entire album. When writing, the band delegated each song a different key. Sound effects were placed between songs to connect them: for example, \"The Root of All Evil\", written in F minor, and the following track, \"The Answer Lies Within\", written in G minor, were connected by a sound effect in the key of F\u266f minor. The album's lyrics and song titles featured references to this concept. Portnoy cited the titles \"The Root of all Evil\" (referring to the musical term \"root\") and \"Octavarium\" (\"the octave of the octave\") as two examples of this.\nOctavarium begins \"The Root of All Evil\" with the final note of the band's previous album, Train of Thought with \"In the Name of God\". Train of Thought started \"As I Am\" with the last note from Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence with the title track, which in turn started with the noise that ended Scenes from a Memory at the end of \"Finally Free\". Portnoy was inspired to do this thanks to the Van Halen album Women and Children First; the outro of the album's final song ended with a new riff being played which faded out. Portnoy recalled that he expected Van Halen's next album to start with that ending riff, but was disappointed when it did not. He later realized he had \"dug a hole where we're expected to do it every time\". He solved this problem on Octavarium, where the final track ends with the beginning of the first one. This made the album a cycle in itself, allowing the band to have a clean start with their next album. At 04:52\u201305:17, there is a lyrical and musical reference to the chorus of \"This Dying Soul\" from Train of Thought. This reference comes from Portnoy's Twelve-step Suite.

It was their final album with Atlantic Records, ending a contract which had lasted fourteen years. Although in recent years the band had been allowed creative freedom, they were dissatisfied by the lack of promotion the label offered them. Portnoy released a DVD entitled Drumavarium in 2005, containing footage of his drum performance from the Octavarium recording sessions.

{"id": "175_379", "question": "Who performed New Order discography?", "ctxs": [{"id": "175_23381", "text": "The discography of New Order, an English rock band, consists of 10 studio albums, 12 compilation albums, six live albums, five extended plays (EPs), 45 singles, 12 video releases, 40 music videos and a number of soundtrack appearances. New Order were formed in 1980 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The group began life as a continuation of their former incarnation Joy Division. Joy Division had disbanded after the death of the lead singer Ian Curtis. Gillian Gilbert, who was Morris's girlfriend at the time, soon joined the group and played guitar and keyboards.\nRemarkably, New Order's first eight singles released between 1981 and 1984 were not taken from any album. In most cases they were not even released as a 7-inch, but exclusively available in the radio-unfriendly 12-inch format, an unusual approach for a pop-act in the eighties.\nDespite the high anticipation that surrounded the group, their debut single \"Ceremony\" only peaked at number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The group's following two singles and their debut album met with similar moderate success. It would not be until the release of their fourth single, \"Blue Monday\", that New Order would break into the top 10, with the song peaking at number 9. \"Blue Monday\" became a defining single for the group and caused a sensation, becoming the biggest selling 12-inch single of all time.New Order, like many other post-punk groups of the period, increasingly utilised keyboards, drum machine and sequencers in their music. As a result, they became associated with the synthpop and electronic dance movements of the 1980s. Beginning with Power, Corruption & Lies from 1983, all of the group's studio albums reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The group experienced a lull in popularity in the years 1985 and 1986 but the surprise international popularity of the \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" single re-launched the group across the world. The group cemented their success in 1987 with the single, \"True Faith\", and the compilation album Substance.\nNew Order were at the peak of their popularity in the years 1987 to 1993, with a run of popular singles, including \"Blue Monday 1988\", \"Fine Time\", \"Regret\", \"World (The Price of Love)\" and in 1990 they scored their only number 1 single in the UK with the official England national football team song, \"World in Motion\". The two albums released during these years, Technique and Republic; each charted at number 1 in the UK. It was during this successful period that the group's internal dynamic began to falter. Sumner was not fond of touring, and wanted to take time off from the group and produce a solo album. He formed Electronic with Johnny Marr and the pair released their first single in 1989. Hook formed his own band, Revenge, in 1989, while Morris and Gilbert worked together as The Other Two, primarily scoring soundtracks. Of the three side projects, Sumner's was by far the most successful.\nThe recording and touring of 1993's Republic, their first for London Records, was difficult and intra-band tensions were rife. The group went on hiatus until 1998. In the meantime two compilation albums, The Best of New Order and The Rest of New Order, and several singles were released.\nThe group reconvened in 1998 for the Reading Festival but did not release new material until 2000. The group released the album Get Ready in 2001. It was met with critical warmth, but it was apparent that the group's popularity had lessened. The lead single from the album, \"Crystal\", reached the top 10 in the UK. The film 24 Hour Party People, a humorous chronicle of their label Factory Records, was released in 2002. New Order contributed a new song, \"Here to Stay\", and a re-recording of the Joy Division song \"New Dawn Fades\" with Moby, for the film's soundtrack. The compilation International and four-disc boxset Retro were released in winter 2002. New Order followed Get Ready with Waiting for the Sirens' Call in 2005. During this period Gilbert stepped down from live performances due to family commitments. Phil Cunningham stepped into her role and in 2005 became an official member of the group.\nThe group had intended to release a ninth album soon after Waiting for the Sirens' Call, the majority of which had already been recorded. The lack of enthusiasm inside the group and relative failure of Waiting for the Sirens' Call stalled their career momentum. In 2007, Hook decided to leave the group, and stated that he and Sumner had no further plans to work together. Sumner formed Bad Lieutenant with Cunningham, and Hook formed Freebass. Morris continued to work with Sumner and Cunningham. In 2008, New Order released remastered and expanded editions of their first five albums with the intention of releasing the further three albums in a similar format in the future.\nLost Sirens was released in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2013. It is an eight-track album of tracks left out of Waiting for the Sirens' Call. On 25 September 2015, the band released a new album, Music Complete. The album was the first without Peter Hook, and was produced mostly by the band themselves, except \"Singularity\" and \"Unlearn This Hatred\", both produced by Tom Rowlands, while \"Superheated\" features additional production by Stuart Price.

After the arms-for-hostages deals hit the news, the increased public awareness of the U.S. government's covert war in Nicaragua prompted Browne to produce and pay for a video for 'Lives in the Balance' well after the album had passed its peak in terms of sales. Discussing the song at the time of the video's release, Browne said, 'I imply that the truth is kept from us on a regular basis. I flat out say the government lies. Well, these things are no longer heresy [sic].'\"Released only as a U.S. 12\" promo and as a 7\" single in Germany, in 1986 the song was associated with American policies in Central America, but within the context of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the song received new life as a single in 2005 when a live version was released from Browne's Solo Acoustic, Vol. 1 album. The song, Mark Coleman says in the Rolling Stone Record Guide, \"is a cutting slice of social observation,\" as demonstrated in the chorus:\nThere are lives in the balance\nThere are people under fire\nThere are children at the cannons\nAnd there is blood on the wire.Jimmy Guterman, in his 1986 Rolling Stone review of the Lives in the Balance album, wrote approvingly of the lyrics of the song: \"For Browne, our crimes in Central America are the clearest example of the wrongheadedness of U.S. foreign policy.

Recording took place in December 2010 and lasted until February 2011 at Paint it Black Studios in Orlando, Florida. Michael Baskette, who worked with Radke on Escape the Fate's Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, returned as the executive producer for the album, alongside former bandmate Omar Espinosa and others as additional composers and production aids in the studio. The Drug in Me Is You was released on July 25, 2011, in Europe and Japan, and on July 26, 2011, in the United States.\nThe album charted at number 19 on the US Billboard 200, selling 18,000 copies in its first week in the United States. It also charted internationally on the national album charts in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. By December 2019, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Upon release, The Drug in Me Is You received mixed reviews. Critics consistently noted the contrast between hardcore music and pop music on the tracks, but to mixed reception. Overall, the lyrics were viewed as being clich\u00e9 while Radke's singing and return to making music were noted. In addition, critics focused on the bitter relationship between Radke and his former band, Escape the Fate, in which reviewers noticed the choice to attack the band in many of the album's tracks.

Following his incarceration and forced departure from his old band, Escape the Fate, Radke formed Falling in Reverse with the help of longtime friend Nason Schoeffler, who found band members and visited Radke while he was in prison. However, Radke was unable to work with the band prior to his release on December 12, 2010. After going through a few bassists and drummers, the band prepared to record their full-length debut album. After the album finished production, bassist and founding member Nason Schoeffler and drummer Scott Gee left the band, making the album their only release with the band. Former Aiden, I Am Ghost, and The Bigger Lights drummer Ryan Seaman replaced Scott Gee and former Cellador member Mika Horiuchi took over bass for Schoeffler.Originally conceived as a double album, the band's debut was originally going to contain one disc of post-hardcore and another with pop punk. This was eventually scrapped in favor for a single album, soon confirmed to be titled, The Drug in Me Is You. The band also confirmed that Radke's friend, Michael Baskette, who had previously worked on Blessthefall's album Witness and Escape the Fate's debut Dying Is Your Latest Fashion (which was also with Radke), would produce the album. Radke announced that the album would be released in 2011 by Epitaph Records, Radke's former label with Escape the Fate.

They announced on December 20 that they would go to Orlando, Florida to record a full-length debut album over a period of two months with a tentative release date of the first quarter of 2011.  The eleven song track list was released soon after. With the help of Executive Producer Michael \"Elvis\" Baskette, mixing and tracking for the album concluded on April 2, 2011. Speaking about working with Baskette as producer, Radke said, \"The dude\u2019s a genius, he really is. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s under the radar or anything, but the guy knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s a vocalist guy. That\u2019s why me and him get along so well.\"The Drug in Me Is You has been described as post-hardcore and pop punk. The songs also included synths, pop-choruses, and other sounds. Radke commented on the inclusion of different genres in songs, comparing different parts of the same song to the sounds of Norma Jean, Underoath, and Katy Perry. Lyrically, according to Radke, some of the songs on the album had tones of being arrogant, comparing the attitude to that commonly found in rap music. This is because Radke has cited Eminem as one of his major influences, so much so that he even included a beat made by Eminem and Dr. Dre during a breakdown on the track \"Sink or Swim\". In an interview, Radke's experiences were compared to Eminem's, noting that, \"[Eminem] is someone who has been knocked down and knocked down, and he\u2019s gotten back up again. Time and time again. And he\u2019s triumphed.\" While the album itself was written during Radke's time in prison, he does not consider it a \"Jailhouse record\", though some songs that did not make the album do address a prison theme.The lyrics for the album were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has often called the album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, \"I would think all day, for days and days, [about] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in different ways. I don\u2019t know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it.\" Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, \"We named it that because ... It's me, looking in the mirror, saying, 'I am my own worst [enemy]. I do the worst damage to myself \u2014 more than anybody else can to do me.'\"Some things explored in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, the corruption of Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related to the death of Michael Cook. Radke stated that he chose not to write any songs about love because, \"...I'm not going to lie ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody. I do have love, but there will be a lot of songs about just what I\u2019ve been through.\" Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating in an interview that he believed that the band's first album without Radke, This War Is Ours, was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate.

{"id": "175_413", "question": "Who performed Dusty in Memphis?", "ctxs": [{"id": "175_23516", "text": "Dusty in Memphis is the fifth studio album by English singer Dusty Springfield. Initial sessions were recorded at American Sound Studio in Memphis, while Springfield's final vocals and the album's orchestral parts were recorded at Atlantic Records' New York City studios. The album was released in March 1969 in the United States by Atlantic Records, and Philips Records distributed the record outside the U.S. Springfield worked on the album with a team of musicians and producers that included Jerry Wexler, Arif Mardin, Tom Dowd, conductor Gene Orloff, backing vocalists the Sweet Inspirations, bassist Tommy Cogbill, and guitarist Reggie Young.\nDusty in Memphis sold poorly upon its initial release despite featuring one of Springfield's top-10 UK hits \"Son of a Preacher Man\". It has been acclaimed as her best work and one of the great albums of all time. Music critic Robert Christgau called it \"the all-time rock-era torch record\" and included it in his \"Basic Record Library\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). In 2001, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.In 2020, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In its official press release, the library stated that despite its modest sales when first released, \"over time, Dusty in Memphis grew in stature to become widely recognized as an important album by a woman in the rock era.\"", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_23517", "text": "Hoping to reinvigorate her career and boost her credibility, Springfield signed with Atlantic Records, at the time the label of Aretha Franklin, one of her soul music idols. Springfield signed with Atlantic on the condition that she work with the label's chief producer and co-owner Jerry Wexler. For their initial album project, Wexler provided Springfield with dozens of song demo recordings, and the two decided on a program of 11 songs, primarily in the pop genre. Eight of the songs were composed by New York and Los Angeles-based songwriters who at the time were associated with the \"Brill Building Sound\". However, \"Son of a Preacher Man\", the album's best-known track, was not among these, and iy was written with the idea of submitting it to Aretha Franklin. (Franklin cut her own version of the song in 1969 after Springfield's single reached the #10 position in the Billboard Hot 100.) \"Preacher Man\" was musically and thematically closer to classic Southern soul as was \"Breakfast in Bed\". Farthest from the soul genre on the album was Michel Legrand's \"The Windmills of Your Mind\", which Springfield resisted and Wexler insisted she do. Wexler's and Springfield's idea for the album was to record the pop compositions with Southern soul's rhythmic feel, a combination that other producers had tried successfully at American Sound Studios with acts like The Box Tops and Merrilee Rush.\nThe Memphis sessions were supervised by Wexler, fellow Atlantic producer Arif Mardin, and Atlantic engineer Tom Dowd. Performing with Springfield were back-up singers the Sweet Inspirations and members of an informal group of American Sound Studios studio musicians known as the Memphis Boys, which included guitarist Reggie Young and bassist Tommy Cogbill. In addition to their pop session work, The Memphis Boys had previously backed soul musicians Wilson Pickett, Joe Tex, Bobby Womack, and King Curtis. Recording engineer Terry Manning, who was hired on assignment to write a piece on the sessions for the New Musical Express, attended and ended up assisting Dowd, along with Ed Kollis. The songs were written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, Randy Newman, and Burt Bacharach and Hal David.The recording was a challenge for Wexler. In his book Rhythm and the Blues, Wexler wrote that out of all the songs that were initially submitted to Springfield for consideration, \"she approved exactly zero.\" For her, he continued, \"to say yes to one song was seen as a lifetime commitment.\" Springfield disputed this, saying she did choose two: \"Son of a Preacher Man\" and \"Just a Little Lovin'\". He was surprised, given Dusty's talent, by her apparent insecurity. Springfield later attributed her initial unease to a very real anxiety about being compared with the soul greats who had recorded in the same studios. Eventually Dusty's final vocals were recorded in New York. Additionally, Springfield stated that she had never before worked with just a rhythm track, and that it was the first time she had worked with outside producers, having self-produced her previous recordings (something for which she never took credit).During the Memphis sessions in November 1968, Springfield suggested to the heads of Atlantic Records that they should sign the newly formed Led Zeppelin group. She knew John Paul Jones, who had backed her in concerts. Without having ever seen them and largely on Dusty's advice, the record company signed the group with a $143,000 advance.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23518", "text": "Dusty in Memphis was released by Atlantic Records in March 1969 in the United States and on 18 April by Philips Records in the United Kingdom. The album was a commercial failure in both countries, reaching only number 99 on the American album charts and failing to chart altogether on the British Top 40. According to music journalist Peter Robinson, its failure stalled Springfield's career rather than revive it, although the record eventually became \"a popcultural milestone [and] timeless emotional reference point\" for listeners who discovered it in second-hand shops or purchased one of its several reissues years later. Robert Christgau called it \"a pop standard and classic\", predicting in his 1973 column for Newsday it would be \"the kind of record that will sell for years because its admirers need replacement copies, and it is the perfect instance of how a production team should work.\" Greil Marcus was less enthusiastic in Rolling Stone, deeming some of the songwriting inconsistent on what was \"a real drifting, cool, smart, sexually distracted soul album\".Despite modest sales (the platter has sold 216,000 in the United States in the SoundScan era, per Luminate Entertainment Data) it was the first of a small wave of \"in Memphis\"-style albums that were recorded by pop singers at American Recording Studios. Three months after Springfield's album was released, Dionne Warwick's Soulful album was released, which had a similar mix of soul and pop and was recorded at American. In the summer of 1969, Elvis Presley's From Elvis in Memphis was released, featuring Presley recording at American with The Memphis Boys musicians. The following year, Petula Clark's Memphis album, also recorded at American, was released. These albums were all part of a larger 1960s and 1970s boom of soul and pop music production in Memphis (home to Stax Records, Hi Records, and other studios and labels), and nearby Muscle Shoals, Alabama.\nDusty in Memphis has been named one of the great albums of all time. NME named it the 54th greatest album ever in their 1993 list, and it was voted number 171 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked the record 89th on the magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, a rating which the album maintained in a 2012 revised list, before rising to number 83 in a 2020 reboot of the list. According to Richie Unterberger of AllMusic, the album's reputation has improved significantly over time as the music is \"deserving of its classic status\". Tony Scherman from Entertainment Weekly wrote Dusty in Memphis is a \"pure gem\", Springfield's greatest work, and perhaps one of the great pop records recorded. Q took note of its balance between \"R&B and sensitive pop dramas\", and Spin critic Chuck Eddy viewed it as one of the all-important blue-eyed soul records. In The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps wrote that Springfield and her team of musicians and producers for Dusty in Memphis developed an elegant and distinct fusion of pop and R&B that predated the Philadelphia soul sound of the 1970s. According to Eric Klinger from PopMatters, its sophisticated style of music influenced the sound of 1990s trip hop artists who sampled songs from the album and became a blueprint for British female singers of the 2000s, including Adele, Amy Winehouse, Duffy, Joss Stone, Paloma Faith and Rumer.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23519", "text": "Dusty in Memphis was first released on compact disc by Philips Records/PolyGram and re-released in the UK/Europe in 1988.

The album has often been noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's cinematic, downtempo sound, the erotic themes in his and Gaye's songwriting, and the singer's prominent use of the synthesizer.

Following a mixed response from critics at the time of its release, I Want You has earned retrospective recognition from writers and music critics as one of Gaye's most controversial works and influential to such musical styles as disco, quiet storm, R&B, and neo soul.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_23675", "text": "By 1975, Marvin Gaye had come off of the commercial and critical success of his landmark studio album Let's Get It On (1973), its successful supporting tour following the album's release, and Diana & Marvin (1973), a duet project with Diana Ross. However, similar to the conception and recording of Let's Get It On, Gaye had struggled to come up with an album as an appropriate follow-up. And much like Let's Get It On Gaye reached for outside help, this time seeking the assistance of Leon Ware, a singer and songwriter who had found previous success writing hits for fellow Motown alum, including pop singer Michael Jackson and the rhythm and blues group The Miracles. Ware had been working on songs for his own album which he would later issue under the title Musical Massage, a collection of erotic singles Ware had composed with a variety of writers, including Jacqueline Hillard and Arthur \"T-Boy\" Ross, brother of Diana Ross. When Motown CEO Berry Gordy paid a visit to Ware, the songwriter was more than happy to play Gordy his selection of tracks. After hearing a preliminary mix of the songs however, Gordy figured that Ware should let Gaye handle his material.While the majority of the album's songs were conceived by Ware, I Want You was transformed into a biographical centerpiece for Gaye, who was then in a volatile marriage with Anna Gordy, sister to Berry Gordy, and also in a long-standing affair with Janis Hunter, who would later become the mother of his two youngest children. Gaye and Hunter were introduced to each other by producer Ed Townsend in 1973 at Hitsville West, while Townsend and Gaye were recording Let's Get It On. Hunter was 17 years old while Gaye was seventeen years her senior at the time Townsend introduced them. In his book Mercy, Mercy Me: The Art, Loves, and Demons of Marvin Gaye, the author and music writer Michael Eric Dyson elaborated on the relationship between I Want You and Gaye's affair with Hunter:\n\n\"I Want You is unmistakably a work of romantic and erotic tribute to the woman he deeply loved and would shortly marry, Janis Hunter. Gaye's obsession with the woman in her late teens is nearly palpable in the sensual textures that are the album's aural and lyrical signature. Their relationship was relentlessly passionate and emotionally rough-hewn; they played up each other's strengths, and played off each other's weaknesses.\"\nThough it was often hinted that Let's Get It On was the album Gaye had dedicated to her, Marvin has stated that this album was dedicated to Hunter, who is believed to have been in the studio when he recorded it. According to music critics, her presence may have increased the emotion in Ware's and Gaye's conception of I Want You. From Gaye's first recordings of I Want You to the album's release in 1976, Hunter and Gaye married and divorced in the span of three short years. Having gone mostly silent since the years of Gaye's death, Janis broke her silence in 2013 by releasing a book titled, After the Dance: My Life with Marvin Gaye where she recalls her turbulent and often violent relationship with Marvin.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23676", "text": "Gaye and Ware recorded and mixed the album at Gaye's newly christened \"Marvin's Room Studio\", located on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and at Motown Recording Studios. The recording sessions took place throughout 1975 and 1976. Much like Gaye's previous studio effort Let's Get It On, I Want You featured Gaye's contribution of background vocals and heavy multi-tracking. Gaye's vocalizing style was in classic doo-wop tradition accompanied by the low tempo of string arrangements and other instrumentation was provided by the Funk Brothers.\n\nGaye's albums, and especially I Want You, have been influential on modern soul music and contemporary R&B. EMI Artists and Repertoire executive Gary Harris, who later assisted neo soul singer D'Angelo in recording his debut album Brown Sugar (1995), later commented on Gaye's significant artistry on I Want You and its opening title track. In an interview with writer Michael Eric Dyson, Harris comments on another popular track from the album \"Soon I'll Be Loving You Again\":\n\nWith the opening, with the congas and the strings; it's like the sun is rising. It's a very cinematic approach to the whole thing. It shows a thing Quincy Jones called \"ear candy.\" The voicings and the arrangements convey not only mood but time, place and image. He's talking about \"dreamed of you this morning.\" It's crazy. The other thing about Marvin and the song is he always, no matter what he was doing, how many risks he would take, he was a radical traditionalist and always held onto his doo-wop upbringing. Those background harmonies ... no matter how increasingly percussive he got, how funky, the background vocals were always steeped in that tradition.\nAnother significant feature of the recording sessions for I Want You was Gaye's use of the synthesizer in his music. During the time of recording, the instrument had entered its modern period of use and had been included in the music of such popular acts as Stevie Wonder and Led Zeppelin. For the instrumental version of \"After the Dance\", Gaye implemented it for a more spacey sound than his previous recordings had featured. Other recordings from these sessions to feature Gaye's synthesizer were later featured on the deluxe edition re-release of I Want You.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23677", "text": "The original The Sugar Shack painting, which was later used for the front album cover of I Want You, was painted and released by neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes in 1971. In 1976, Barnes redesigned the painting for use by television producer Norman Lear for the opening credits of Good Times, his hit CBS sitcom that ran from 1974 to 1979. The Sugar Shack portrays a cultural image of a shack full of black people dancing. The Sugar Shack was painted by Barnes in his signature post-mannerist style, using serpentine lines, elongation of the human figure, clarity of line, unusual spatial relationships, painted frames, and distinctive color palettes. This style of technique and composition is similar to the mannerist style of 16th-century artists such as Michelangelo and Raphael, which has led Barnes to be credited as the founder of the Neo-Mannerism movement. Art critic Frank Getlein later called The Sugar Shack a \"stunning demonstration of the fusion of Neo-Mannerism and Genre painting that Barnes alone has perfected and practices\", and went on to say:\n\nThe dances of ordinary people have been a standard subject of Genre painting since it was invented by Breughel. The perfectly controlled lighting and the elaborate poses of the elongated figures are class Mannerism. Sugar Shack effortlessly combines the two heritages in Neo-Mannerism Genre painting. Any Mannerist painter would be proud of the succession of figures in the main, central group of dancers, but the whole is infused with the innocent exuberance of Breughel and his fellow Flemings.\nThe Sugar Shack has been known to art critics for embodying the style of art composition known as \"Black Romantic\", which, according to Natalie Hopkinson of The Washington Post, is the \"visual-art equivalent of the Chitlin' Circuit.\" According to Barnes, he created the original version after reflecting upon his childhood, during which he was not \"able to go to a dance.\" In an interview with SoulMuseum.net, Barnes was asked whether there were any messages he was attempting to express through the painting. He stated \"'Sugar Shack' is a recall of a childhood experience. It was the first time my innocence met with the sins of dance. The painting transmits rhythm so the experience is re-created in the person viewing it. To show that African-Americans utilize rhythm as a way of resolving physical tension\"Gaye was introduced to Barnes by colleague Barbara Hunter, which led to him buying eight Barnes originals, including The Sugar Shack. After Gaye asked him for permission to use the painting as an album cover, Barnes then augmented the painting by adding references to Gaye's album, including banners hanging from the ceiling of the shack promoting the album's singles. Since the initial wide acclaim for The Sugar Shack, Barnes has gained further recognition from art critics as one of the best black painters of his time and was cited by the Oakland Tribune as the \"Picasso of the black art world.\" The original piece was later purchased by actor and comedian Eddie Murphy.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23678", "text": "I Want You was released March 16, 1976 in the United States on the Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. While not as successful sales-wise as Gaye's previous landmark albums What's Going On and Let's Get It On, I Want You sold in excess of 1 million copies in the United States with help mostly coming from its first single \"I Want You\". The single topped the Billboard Soul Singles chart, quickly becoming Marvin Gaye's eleventh number-one hit on that chart, while peaking at number fifteen on the Billboard Pop Singles chart.The album's second single, the quiet storm track \"After the Dance (Vocal)\", charted modestly, peaking at #14 on the Soul Singles chart and #74 on the Pop Singles chart, while another single release version of the song, a double A-sided vinyl record for dance clubs and discoth\u00e8ques, hit the top ten of the Billboard Disco Singles chart. The song became a staple of dance clubs and discoth\u00e8ques during the late 1970s. \"After the Dance\" was hailed as one of Gaye's signature songs during the late 1970s and was later described by Gaye-biographer David Ritz as \"emblematic for the final chapter of his career.\" I Want You became his fourth album to reach the top ten of the Billboard 200 chart and his fifth number-one album on the Soul Albums chart.\nDespite its chart success, I Want You received mixed reviews from music critics at the time of its release. It has been noted by music writers that the critical reception of disco music in general had been poor and ill-considered, which may have caused the slightly disco-styled I Want You to suffer critically, in comparison to Gaye's previous albums. Los Angeles Times writer Dennis Hunt called the album \"disappointing\" and \"only partially commendable\". Rolling Stone's Vince Aletti criticized Leon Ware's production for being too low-key, and perceived that Gaye lacks the certain passion in his lyricism and singing from his previous records. Aletti compared the album to Gaye's previous work, writing  that \"Gaye seems determined to take over as soul's master philosopher in the bedroom, a position that requires little but an affectation of constant, rather jaded horniness. The pose has already been established in Let's Get It On, on which Gaye was hot, tender, aggressive, soothing and casually raunchy\u2014the modern lover with all his contradictions. I Want You continues in the same vein but with only the faintest traces of the robust passion that shot through and sustained the earlier album ... one expects something with a little more substance and spirit. But there's no fire here, only a well-concealed pilot light.\"Cliff White of NME called the album \"almost a voyeur's delight\", and was not favorable of Gaye's sensual themes, stating \"Although getting down, getting mellow, and getting it on are paramount considerations in the privacy of my own home, I don't particularly want to be party to someone else's night life. Not on record anyway ... Like peeking through the windows of the Gaye residence in the wee wee hours. Perhaps that's your kick, but personally I find it a mite frustrating.\" White also criticized the album's sound, describing the songs as \"all expressions of the same mood. Sensual, satisfied, and spaced out\", and calling I Want You \"simply the explorative aftermath of Let's Get It On. The sweet nuthin's of a drowsy, sweat-streaked lover.\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote favorably of the album's sound quality. However, he criticized the lyrical content, as well as Ware's involvement in songwriting, stating \"was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice?

Pearl Jam wrote and recorded Vitalogy while touring behind its previous album Vs. (1993). The album's sound is more diverse than previous releases and consists of aggressive rock songs, ballads, and other stylistic elements, making it Pearl Jam's most experimental album at that period. Considered a departure from the grunge sound of the band's first two albums, the record focuses more on punk rock and hardcore styles in its production.The album was first released on vinyl, followed by a release on CD and cassette two weeks later on December 6, 1994. The LP sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, and until Jack White's 2014 album Lazaretto it held the record for most vinyl sales in one week since SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991. Upon its CD release, Vitalogy became the second-fastest selling album in history, behind only the band's previous release Vs., selling 877,000 copies in its first week and quickly going multi-platinum. The album received critical acclaim and has been certified 5\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of at least five million copies in the United States. The album was included on Rolling Stone's 2003 and 2012 \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" lists at number 485, but was dropped from the 2020 edition. It is Pearl Jam's second and last album to feature drummer Dave Abbruzzese, who was fired from the band before recording was finished. He was initially replaced by session drummers and later officially replaced by former Red Hot Chili Peppers' drummer Jack Irons, who completed the recording of the album.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_23705", "text": "For the band's third album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer Brendan O'Brien. The band wrote many of the songs during soundchecks on its Vs. Tour, and the majority of the album's tracks were recorded during breaks on the tour. The first session took place late in 1993 in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the band recorded \"Tremor Christ\" and \"Nothingman\". The rest of the material was written and recorded in 1994 in sessions in Seattle, Washington and Atlanta, Georgia, with the band finishing the album at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle after the tour's completion. \"Immortality\" was written in April 1994 when the band was on tour in Atlanta. Sources state that most of the album was completed by early 1994, but it was not released until November due to either a forced delay by Epic or the band's battle with ticket vendor Ticketmaster.Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by the time they were working on Vitalogy. Producer Brendan O'Brien said: \"Vitalogy was a little strained. I'm being polite\u2014there was some imploding going on.\" Bassist Jeff Ament said that \"communication was at an all-time low\". Drummer Dave Abbruzzese stated that the communication problems started once guitarist Stone Gossard stopped acting as the band's mediator. According to Gossard, Vitalogy was the first album for which lead vocalist Eddie Vedder made the final decisions. At the time, Gossard thought of quitting the band. Gossard said the band was having trouble collaborating, so most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. He added that \"80 percent of the songs were written 20 minutes before they were recorded.\" During the production of Vitalogy, lead guitarist Mike McCready went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for alcohol and cocaine abuse.Drums on \"Satan's Bed\" were performed by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On the day it was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as \"Jimmy\". Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for Vitalogy, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with other band members. Gossard said: \"It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason, his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled.\" Jack Irons, the original drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\". Gossard said: \"Jack entered the band right at the end of making Vitalogy. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23706", "text": "Overall, Vitalogy has been identified as a punk rock album by both critics and members of Pearl Jam, departing the grunge sound of the band's previous work. Despite this, some publications have labeled the album as grunge.In a 1995 interview, Guitar World writer Jeff Gilbert described Vitalogy as \"strange\" and \"very eclectic\". McCready agreed, saying: \"There is some weird stuff on there.\" McCready attributed the album's sound to the group recording it on tour. During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said: \"Vitalogy is the first one where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more punk feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly.\" The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said: \"Vitalogy is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; it was more of a rhythmic album.\"Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that \"thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, Vitalogy stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album.\" He added that \"in between the straight rock numbers and the searching slow songs, Pearl Jam contribute their strangest music\u2014the mantrafunk of 'Aye Davanita', the sub-Tom Waits accordion romp of 'Bugs', and the chilling sonic collage 'Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me'.\" \"Bugs\" features Vedder playing an accordion that he found at a thrift shop, while \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\" was created using looped recordings of real patients from a psychiatric hospital. Tim Coffman of WhatCulture considers Vitalogy to be a delve into art rock, commenting that the band \"[threw] every outlandish idea into the mix.\"Many of the songs on the album address the pressures of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include \"Not for You\", \"Pry, To\", \"Corduroy\", \"Bugs\", \"Satan's Bed\" and \"Immortality\". Vedder said: \"I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express.\" The lyrics of \"Not for You\" express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and \"how youth is being sold and exploited\", while Vedder said \"Corduroy\" is about \"one person's relationship with a million people.\" In \"Pry, To\" the phrase \"P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me\" is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of \"Immortality\" may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it is about \"the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train.\" The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of \"Immortality\" were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said, regarding \"Nothingman\", that \"if you love someone and they love you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing.\" \"Better Man\" is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote the song when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio. Considered a \"blatantly great pop song\" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23707", "text": "The original title for the album was Life. The first single, \"Spin the Black Circle\", was released before the album was released, and on the back of the single it states: \"From the Epic album Life\".\nThe title Vitalogy, which literally means \"the study of life\", came from an early 20th-century medical book that Vedder found at a garage sale. This book was also the inspiration for the album's cover art and liner notes. Ament stated: \"Ed brought in that book, and we said man that would make a great album cover.\" After explaining that, from Vs. onward, the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records, he said: \"We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways.\" Packaging the album in this way cost an extra 50 cents per copy. When the band discovered that later versions of the medical book were still under copyright, they had to confer with their lawyers as they worked out which material they wanted to utilize in the final version of the artwork.The booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well-being, as well as other notes, dealing with life and death reflections, which seem to be more personal, like a message typed on the \"Immortality\" page that seems to be referring to the loss of a loved one (\"I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted to tell you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me.\"). It also includes some poems or original sayings that do not belong to the songs' lyrics, but can be interpreted as commentary on the songs or, again, as a reflection on how life should or should not be lived. An example is the poem typed on the \"Aye Davanita\" page. The song's subtitle is listed as \"The song without words\", as it is an instrumental track, but the page also displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of \"intruder words\" is on the \"Not for You\" page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the Sisyphus myth (\"Call me Sisyphus love. Yeh, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Get pictures taken of me while moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock.\").

Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised the album's diversity compared to the band's previous records, commenting that the band incorporated \"fast but brutal punk, fuzz-toned psychedelia and judicious folk-rock, all of it sounding more spontaneous than before.\" He felt the band continued to be \"unremittingly glum\", and described the majority of the songs as \"tortured first-person proclamations\", commenting that \"Vedder sounds more alone than ever.\" Time reviewer Christopher John Farley singled out \"Bugs\" as one of the album's \"share of stinkers\", but added \"that's one admirably experimental failure on a largely successful album.\" Despite writing negatively of the album's \"shapeless high-energy riff-rockers\", Newsday staff writer Ira Robbins lauded Vitalogy's sound and called it a \"compelling triumph of surface over substance\".

Jam's book, token experiments like \"Bugs\" are genuinely weird, and in an era of compulsory irony [Vedder's] sincerity is something like a relief\u2014a Kurtlike relief at that.\" David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+, saying that \"Vitalogy marks the first time it's possible to respect the band's music as much as its stance\", but \"despite its musical advances, Vitalogy leaves an odd, unsettling aftertaste. You walk away from it energized, but wondering what price Eddie Vedder, and Pearl Jam, will ultimately pay for it.\" Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis gave tha album three out of four stars and commended Pearl Jam for their earnest songwriting. However, DeRogatis also wrote that the album \"leaves you wishing that they'd just lighten up\".

The song was released in 1994 as part of the single \"Heart\". In 1995, Hayao Miyazaki wrote and directed the short film for the song as a side-project after having writer's block with Princess Mononoke. The anime music video is non-linear, providing multiple reiterations and alternate scenes to depict the events. The music video added sound effects to the audio track, but contains no dialogue. Miyazaki purposely misinterpreted the lyrics to present his vision of a world where the surface becomes inhospitable and humans live in an underground city. He made the video cryptic to evoke creative interpretations among viewers.\nThe music video follows two policemen who raid and massacre a religious cult and find an angelic being, only to have her taken away and confined to a secure laboratory. Haunted by the fate of the angel, the two men formulate a plan and break into the laboratory. Fleeing in an armored truck, the three plummet into an abyss after trying to force past a police aircraft along a narrow, suspended roadway. After a montage of the previous scenes, the armored truck suddenly rockets into an apartment complex, allowing their escape. The three escape to the surface, ignoring the radiation and danger signs, emerging near an encased nuclear reactor. The two men set the angel free and she flies off into the sky.\nThe music video was well-received and praised for its animation and attention to detail.

Futuristic flying troop transports crash through the windows of a tower topped by gigantic neon-lit eyes and occupied by armed defenders. The policemen exchange gunfire and grenades with cultists whose hoods depict an enormous eye. As the victorious police begin to sort through the bodies of the cultists, two policemen find what appears to be a girl, lying unconscious, with large feathered wings on her back.\nThe scene changes again, now to bright daylight and blue sky. Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto down an empty road. As one of the men helps the girl up, she spreads her wings and he holds her hands while she gains confidence. With a nudge she is airborne, but she seems hesitant and afraid as he lets go.\nThe scene changes back to the discovery of the girl in the tower, and the identity of the two policemen is revealed to be the same from the previous sequence. They carefully carry her out and offer her something to drink. A team of scientists wearing radiation suits arrive and quickly take the girl away.\nThe two men are haunted by the girl's fate and formulate a plan to rescue her. They break into the laboratory and free her from confinement, but the lab's alarms are triggered. The three escape in an armored truck and drive along a narrow suspended roadway over a domed city built in a crater. Police hovercraft are in pursuit, and one of them comes very low to the roadway to block the fugitives' truck. The roadway collapses when the protagonists try to force their way through, sending the truck plummeting. The winged girl refuses to let go of the hands of her rescuers, and the three fall into the abyss.\nA brief montage of previous shots follows: the discovery of the girl, the girl flying through a blue sky, the two men rescuing the girl from the laboratory and stealing the truck, the truck plummeting amidst the wreckage of the roadway. But this time, the truck fires stabilizing thrusters and makes a short flight into the side of an apartment building. After their escape, the three are riding an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto through a dark tunnel underneath signs which bear radiation symbols and read (in kanji) \"Beware Of Sunlight\" and \"Survival Not Guaranteed\". As they emerge into daylight, they drive past nuclear cooling towers and a sign which reads \"Extreme Danger\" and continue down the road.\nOne of the men helps the girl up, she spreads her wings and gives them a grateful smile; he kisses her hand, and the other winks in farewell.

Miyazaki wrote and directed the music video for \"On Your Mark\", although the song was previously released in 1994 as part of the single \"Heart\". Despite the popularity of the work, Toshio Suzuki told Helen McCarthy, the British author of numerous anime reference books, that Studio Ghibli had not given \"100 percent\" focus to the music video.In the production of the music video, Miyazaki experimented with using computer animation to supplement traditional hand drawn cel-animation. At the time Studio Ghibli did not have its own computer department and the work was outsourced to CG Production Company Links, under supervision of Hideki Nakano, Silicon Graphics, Softimage 3D, and Alias Research. Techniques learned in the experimentation for On Your Mark were later adopted for the creation of Princess Mononoke. Animation director was Masashi And\u014d. Long time Miyazaki collaborator Michiyo Yasuda was in charge of colour selection. Backgrounds were created by Kazuo Oga. Y\u014dji Takeshige made his debut as art director.

Dani Cavallaro, an author of books related to anime, reflected on this by proposing that hope retains its purity and authenticity when it is ephemeral, evanescent and elusive. Hope may cause exertion and possibly pain, but denying hope is to deny the feasibility or and vision it provides. Miyazaki said that in the music video's setting, humans live in an underground city after the surface of the Earth has been contaminated with radiation, creating a sanctuary for nature. Miyazaki did not find this believable, though, as humanity would suffer on the surface instead. Miyazaki intentionally misinterpreted the lyrics to reflect upon the vision of a world filled with disease and radiation and people's reactions to that world. He implied the two policemen might not be able to return to their old life, but offered no reason as to why.Cavallaro noted that the lyrics of the song include \"ryuukou no kaze\", which translates to \"flu\" and is also an idiom for \"the flu of fashion.\" The author further interpreted it as \"I always feel the urge to make a fresh start\" suggesting this could be the \"bleak acceptance of the ideological and economic codes that mold our lives in accordance with the imperative of planned obsolescence, or as a hopeful embracing of the genuine prospects of renewal and change.\" Cavallaro suggested that despite the feminine appearance of the angel, it could be of a \"preternatural order\", making gender or sex distinctions irrelevant. Miyazaki referred to the angelic creature as \"tori no hito\" or \"a bird's person\" which is the nickname of Nausica\u00e4 from his Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind manga and film. Cavallaro noted another visual correspondence to Only Yesterday with the oppressive urban environment and the freedom of open spaces.During their April 1999 lecture series on manga, anime and the works of Miyazaki at the University of Dallas, Pamela Gossin, Professor of Arts and Humanities, and guest instructor Marc Hairston, research scientist in the William B. Hanson Center for Space Sciences, discussed On Your Mark in their lecture, \"In the Coda On Your Mark and Nausicaa, and drew parallels to the Nausica\u00e4 story, its titular character and its conclusion. Gossin and Hairston interpreted the release of the winged girl at the end of the video as Miyazaki setting free his character in a manner reminiscent of William Shakespeare's symbolic liberation of his characters, through Prospero's release of his servant Ariel in his play The Tempest.\nThe final volume of the Nausica\u00e4 manga was released in January 1995. Miyazaki started creating On Your Mark that same month.McCarthy highlighted similarities to different works and real life found throughout the film, remarking that the opening city sequence could be an homage to Akira or Blade Runner and the attack on the religious cult could be a reflection of the Aum Shinrikyo movement. Nausicaa.net stated the production occurred prior to the police raid following the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March 1995. McCarthy also noted that the film's scientists' decontamination gear look like the hero of Porco Rosso and the rescue scene is reminiscent of Princess Leia in Star Wars. The encased or \"box\" structure in the film is an homage to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant which was entombed in concrete following the Chernobyl disaster.Miyazaki scholar Seiji Kan\u014d observed that the urban settings have a China Town style and resemble the cityscapes of Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell animated film adaptation, in production at the time. While Miyazaki has been non-committal about the nature of his winged entity in On your Mark, Kan\u014d noted that the manga Seraphim 266613336Wings, an unfinished collaborative effort by Oshii and Satoshi Kon, with its Angel Disease theme, was still serialized in Animage at the time Miyazaki was creating On Your Mark in 1995.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_23853", "text": "The music video was well received.

The UK release saw the first 5,000 copies of Sides packaged with a Collectors Album edition of Private Parts & Pieces.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_23951", "text": "Following the release of his second album Wise After the Event in May 1978, Phillips started work on his next record which was to be an album of all fresh material. However, the writing sessions had Phillips in doubt as to whether his re-emergence as a recording artist in 1977 was at the right time, as his progressive style of music was becoming increasingly out of fashion. Phillips also had difficulty in deciding what musical direction to undertake, and saw little value in recording more folk and romantic-oriented music which he had done on his first album The Geese & the Ghost (1977) and Wise After the Event. His label, the US-based Passport Records, put pressure on him to deliver more radio friendly songs.\nDuring the preparation of the album's material, Phillips called upon producer and songwriter Rupert Hine and drummer Michael Giles to assist, both of whom had worked on Wise After the Event. Phillips was soon advised by Passport and his management to include guest vocalists as they deemed his songwriting ability strong enough, but figured other singers would benefit the material in a commercial sense. Phillips was attracted to this idea as he lacked the confidence to handle all the lead vocals himself, and hired singers Dan Owen and Dale Newman, the latter once a member of the Genesis road crew.Before recording began, Phillips and the group rehearsed for two weeks at Farmyard Studios in Buckinghamshire. They completed some songs there, including \"Um & Aargh\" which was an easy track for them to put together, and \"Nightmare\". Recording began in October 1978 at Essex Studios in London. The best takes of each track were transferred to a 24-track master to allow room for overdubs and vocals, and it was decided to mix down the original 16-track recordings for four songs, \"Sisters of Remindum\", \"Bleak House\", \"Magdalen\", and \"Nightmare\", straight onto the master. Both masters were then synchronised during the mixing stage. Recording then moved to Matrix Studios in London, where engineering duties were overseen by Nick Bradford, and the overdubs were put down at Trident Studios.

It was released in instrumental form on Archive Collection Volume I in 1998.In December 1978, after preparing a master copy, President Records manager Marty Scott suggested that some tracks would benefit from a remix or added instrumentation. A final recording session was booked, whereby Collins played the saxophone on \"Side Door\" and the track was remixed, and \"Um & Aargh\" was changed. A final session took place at Pye Studios on 11 January 1979 where Morris Pert added percussion to \"Lucy Will\" and \"Nightmare\".Phillips wanted to name the album Balls in response to one comment that his songs \"didn't have 'enough balls'\", but was told that the title was \"too eccentric\", resulting in the change to Sides.

McCoy co-wrote the song with its producers Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of the Smeezingtons. The song was created from a melody hummed by Mars and Lawrence. The lyrics were written during an eleven-day trip Mars and Levine made to London to work on a record, supported by Mars's label.\n\"Billionaire\" is a reggae and pop-rap song. Critical reception towards the song was mixed, as music critics praised the song's style comparing it to the music of Sublime, Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson, but criticized its songwriting.

Such elements include helping those in need, having a show like Oprah and being on the cover of Forbes magazine once McCoy becomes a billionaire.

The first song the team worked on and recorded with McCoy was \"One at a Time\", released as a charity single for MTV's Staying Alive Foundation. Mars and Lawrence usually hummed melodies, while Aaron Bay-Schuck, former Atlantic Records A&R rep, encouraged them to develop the best of those, such as \"Nothin' on You\" and \"Billionaire\". In the beginning, they had only \"scratch chorus demos of \"Nothin' On You\" and \"Billionaire\", with a guitar on the backing track and Mars singing on top of it. It was the first song McCoy began to work on after abandoning the original material for the album.Mars came up with the lyrical concept for \"Billionaire\" during a trip to London, to work on a record. He and Ari Levine were each given \u00a3240 ($350) by Mars's record label to live on for eleven days. Mars found the amount of money to be insufficient, and explained, \"We were like, 'Is this the biggest mistake we've ever made? We thought we were broke in California; what are we going to do here?' So we've got no money, and I'm walking the streets and came up with, 'I wanna be a billionaire, so frickin' bad'\". Mars also claimed that his own finances inspired him to write the track, \"I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about, you know, I can\u2019t afford to get breakfast, so I\u2019ll wait until lunchtime to eat\".When Mars first showed McCoy the hook, the latter decided to decline the collaboration, saying to him: \"Dude, we're in a recession right now. I'm gonna get crucified\". Nevertheless, when McCoy later returned home, he realized the track \"had potential\". From then on, the rapper began writing his verses with \"goofy humor and flashes of political conscience\" that \"counterbalanced the hook's materialism\". McCoy claimed he \"made it more relatable\". McCoy intended to avoid \"superficial\" lyrics in the song in the wake of an economic recession, and added, \"There's something to sing about here; if I was in the position to have a ridiculous amount of money, would I be selfish or selfless?' I just took that concept and ran with it\". According to Mars, he and McCoy \"came up\" with the song after listening to the Beatles' \"Can't Buy Me Love\". Mars was not supposed to feature on the hook of \"Billionaire\", however, his \"charisma\" when he sang it prompted the label and McCoy to keep his vocal after the final version was recorded.On January 28, 2014, Demetrius Orlandus Proctor filed a lawsuit, claiming to hold the copyright for \"Billionaire\". Proctor alleged he has owned the copyright to the track's music and lyrics since March 31, 2011, though the song was released a year before. As evidence, he submitted a United States Copyright Office registration certificate for Frisky Vol. 1 to 30 (Tapes), issued in 2000. In the suit, Proctor accused McCoy and Mars of \"willful and intentional\" infringement of copyright, and sought the destruction of all copies of the recording.

Gregory Heaney of AllMusic compared the song to the works of Sublime, while Digital Spy's Nick Levine compared it to No Doubt's \"Underneath It All\" (2002). Rodrigo Perez of MTV News wrote the song reminded him of a fusion between Sublime, Common and Jason Mraz. MTV News' Tamar Anitai thought the song gave her a Jason Mraz, Jack Johnson and Shwayze's \"Corona and Lime\" (2008) summer vibe. James Montgomery felt the same way, dubbing it as \"sunny, shiny, breezy and blissed-out\". Mars's style of singing has also been compared to that of Jack Johnson. \"Billionaire\" was composed in the key of A major at a tempo of 80 beats per minute.Lyrically, the chorus of the song is materialistic, money-driven\u2014\"I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad\"\u2014with amusing and political verses counterbalancing it. The songwriting concerns the lifestyle that McCoy and Mars would have with such money, including the fashion, luxury, \"shoulder-rubbing\", and influence. It goes into detail, outlining McCoy's wish list for when he becomes a billionaire. He fantasizes about success, helping after Hurricane Katrina, having a show like Oprah Winfrey, meeting The Queen and adopting unfortunate children. On the other hand, Mars expresses interest in having his name \"in shining lights\" and appearing on the cover of Forbes magazine. Sharyar Rizvi of the Dallas Observer compared the lyrics of \"Billionaire\" to those of Nas' \"If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)\" (1996) and Barenaked Ladies' \"If I Had $1000000\" (1992).

USA Today's Jerry Shriver praised the single, finding it \"hilarious\". Fraser McAlpine from BBC Chart Blog gave the single four stars. He commented that the track is \"optimistic\" and cheerful, with a positive message of \"hope and generosity\". Nevertheless, McAlpine criticized the use of explicit language, calling it \"a little ripe for genteel ears\".In a mixed review, Billboard's Melanie Bertoldi awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that the song's lyrics \"may be inconsistent, but the beat still goes down smoothly\". Rodrigo Perez of MTV News praised the song's instrumentation but criticized its lyrics, calling them a \"laundry list of wishes\". The New York Times's Jon Caramanica said the song has a \"moody underbelly\", complementing its \"stirring hook\", also noting that McCoy takes a \"quick potshot\" at his ex Katy Perry in one of the verses.In a negative review, Mike Diver of BBC dubbed the reggae stylings of \"Billionaire\" as \"horribly dated\". Likewise, Sharyar Rizvi of the Dallas Observer heavily criticized the song's lyrics saying they, \"sound a bit like other songs that explain what the musician would do if they had a bunch of money or ruled the world\". Rizvi added that she would like to see McCoy to do some philanthropic work as he promised in the song.

It was released on July 13, 2005, by Avex Trax. The album's lyrical content, composing and arrangement was handled by multiple music collaborators, such as Nao'ymt, SUGI-V, Michico, Tricky Stewart, T.Kura, among many others. It is her second full length urban contemporary record, and is made up of songs of various musical genres. Amuro uses the term \"hip-pop\" to describe the music on the album because it fuses pop music with other genres including R&B and hip-hop music. Three different formats were released to promote the album: a standalone CD, a limited edition Playbutton, and digital download.\nUpon its release, Queen of Hip-Pop received positive reviews from music critics. Commercially, the album was a success in Japan, hitting the second position on the Oricon Albums Chart, and has since been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). Four singles were released from the album: \"Alarm\", \"All For You\", \"Girl Talk/The Speed Star\" and \"Want Me, Want Me\". The latter two singles, \"Girl Talk/The Speed Star\" and \"Want Me, Want Me\", both peaked at No. 2 on the Oricon Singles Chart. Meanwhile, \"Alarm\" and \"All For You\" peaked at No. 11 and No. 6 respectively. Queen of Hip-Pop is considered Amuro's comeback album, being her best selling record since 2000's Genius 2000, and was her most commercially successful effort in half a decade before Play was released.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_24062", "text": "For Queen of Hip-Pop, Amuro's record label Avex Trax hired a wide array of musicians, such as Michico, T.Kura, SUGI-V, Nao'ymt, among many others to work on the album. Those producers are just some of whom worked with Amuro on her preceding album Style. Amuro contributed as the main and background vocalist.\nThe title track is a bouncy R&B number with a great combination of hand claps and floating synths. The Michico and SUGI-V penned song \"Want Me, Want Me\" is a reggae-style dance tune with an addictive loop that incorporates Japanese elements like the koto that plays during the intro. Atypical for Amuro, the song contains sexually aggressive lyrics and even name-drops the condom brand Trojan. The song \"WoWa\" (pronounced \"Ooh Wah\") is an uptempo R&B and dance-pop number with an impressive arrangement that mixes sounds made by real people, such as marching, hand claps, and flutes, which was custom-tailored by Nao'ymt. \"I Wanna Show You My Love\" was written by Michico while its music was composed by T.Kura & Michico. Musically, the song is a UK-style R&B number that serves as a love letter to Amuro's fans. \"Girl Talk\" is a pop dance tune provided by T. Kura and Michico. \"Free\" is a mid-tempo Southern hip hop tune with a dark intro that develops into a bewitching rhythmic synth sound which was written by Nao'ymt. \"My Darling\" is a soulful Crunk&B number written by Michico while its music was tailor-made by T.Kura & Michico. \"Ups & Downs\" is a midtempo R&B number featuring Nao'ymt, who also produced it. \"Ups & Downs\" was originally planned to be sung solo, but after Amuro heard Nao'ymt singing the song exceptionally, Amuro told him, \"I would love to sing it with you,\" and decided to make it a duet.\"I Love You\" is a disco pop number with sparkling rhythmic bouncing sounds. The words 'I love you' are said four times during the chorus in four different languages (French, English, Spanish and Chinese). The track is a Tricky Stewart-produced cover with Japanese lyrics. \"All for You\" is the album's sole ballad, which is written by Natsumi Watanabe and musically composed by Ryoki Matsumoto. \"Alarm\" is a pop and R&B song with a heavy bass which was written by Jusme and composed by Monk. \"No\" is an exciting club tune with a bouncy sound which was crafted by Nao'ymt. The bridge, with its handclaps and synths, stirs up calls of \"N-A-M-I-E.\" After the song \"No\", there is a hidden track which has no official title but is known to fans as \"No Pt.2\" or \"Yes\". At 4:06, the listener begins to hear the subtle sounds of the hidden track beginning. The song is a slower version of \"No\" with new lyrics and vocals.

After striking Carroll, he attacked his own wife, knocking her to the ground and hitting her with his shoe.Within five minutes from the time of the blow, Carroll leaned heavily against the barmaid next to her and complained of feeling ill. Carroll told co-workers, \"I feel deathly ill, that man has upset me so.\" The barmaid and another employee helped Carroll to the kitchen. Her arm became numb, her speech thick. She collapsed and was hospitalized. Carroll died eight hours after the assault. Her autopsy showed hardened arteries, an enlarged heart and high blood pressure. A spinal tap confirmed brain hemorrhage as the cause of death. She died in Mercy Hospital at 9 a.m. on February 9, 1963.\nZantzinger was initially charged with murder. His defense was that he had been extremely drunk, and he claimed to have no memory of the attack. His charge was reduced to manslaughter and assault, based on the likelihood that it was her stress reaction to his verbal and physical abuse that led to the intracranial bleeding, rather than blunt-force trauma from the blow that left no lasting mark. On August 28, Zantzinger was convicted of both charges and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. Time magazine covered the sentencing:In June, after Zantzinger's phalanx of five topflight attorneys won a change of venue to a court in Hagerstown, a three-judge panel reduced the murder charge to manslaughter. Following a three-day trial, Zantzinger was found guilty. For the assault on the hotel employees: a fine of $125. For the death of Hattie Carroll: six months in jail and a fine of $500. The judges considerately deferred the start of the jail sentence until September 15, to give Zantzinger time to harvest his tobacco crop.\nAfter the sentence was announced, the New York Herald Tribune conjectured he was given a sentence that short to keep him out of the largely black state prison, reasoning his notoriety would make him a target for abuse there. Zantzinger served his time in the comparative safety of the Washington County county jail, some 70 miles (110 km) from the scene of the crime. In September, the Herald Tribune quoted Zantzinger on his sentence: \"I'll just miss a lot of snow.\" His then-wife, Jane, was quoted saying, \"Nobody treats his niggers as well as Billy does around here.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_24117", "text": "Zantzinger was convicted of manslaughter on August 28, 1963, and was not tried by a jury of peers but by a panel of three judges. The sentence was handed down on the same day that Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Bob Dylan, aged 22 at that time, was one of the celebrities at the march and on the journey home to New York City he read about the conviction of Zantzinger and decided to write a protest song about the case. According to a 1991 Washington Post report, Dylan wrote the song in Manhattan, sitting in an all-night cafe. A radio documentary on the song said rather that he wrote it both in New York and at the home of his then-lover, Joan Baez, in Carmel. According to Nancy Carlin, a friend of Baez who visited: \"He would stand in this cubbyhole, beautiful view across the hills, and peck type on an old typewriter... there was an old piano up at Joan's... and peck piano playing... up until noon he would drink black coffee then switch over to red wine, quit about five or six.\" He recorded it on October 23, 1963, when the trial was still relatively fresh news, and incorporated it into his live repertoire immediately, before releasing the studio version on February 10, 1964. The song juxtaposes Zantzinger's wealth and connections with the brevity of that sentence. Despite the song's topical nature, Dylan has continued to perform it in concert as of May 2009.  His live-audience renditions of it appear on the albums The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue (2002; recorded November 21, 1975), The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall (2004; recorded October 31, 1964), and Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections (2018; recorded October 26, 1963).  In 2019, five live performances of the song from the 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue tour were released on the box set The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings.\nIn Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan includes \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\" in a list of his early songs which he feels were influenced by his introduction to the work of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. He describes writing out the words of \"Pirate Jenny\" (or \"The Black Freighter\") in order to understand how the Brecht\u2013Weill song achieved its effect. Dylan writes: \"Woody had never written a song like that. It wasn't a protest or a topical song and there was no love for people in it. I took the song apart and unzipped it\u2014it was the free verse association, the structure and disregard for the known certainty of melodic pattern to make it seriously matter, give it its cutting edge. It also had the ideal chorus for the lyrics.\"Literary critic Christopher Ricks considers the song to be \"one of Dylan's greatest\" and the recording on The Times They Are A-Changin' to be \"perfect\". He devotes an entire chapter to it, analyzing both the meaning as well as the prosody in his book on Dylan's songs as poetry. \"But here is a song that could not be written better.\"Dylan's song (\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\") contains at least two inaccuracies. Zantzinger was not booked for first degree murder, but for second degree murder.

In 1986, the same year the IRS ruled against him, Charles County confiscated those properties. Nonetheless, Zantzinger continued to collect rents, raise rents, and even successfully prosecute his putative tenants for back rent. In June 1991, Zantzinger was initially charged with a single count of \"deceptive trade practices.\" After some delay, Zantzinger pleaded guilty to 50 misdemeanor counts of unfair and deceptive trade practices. He was sentenced to 19 months in prison and a $50,000 fine. Some of his prison sentence was served in a work release program.In 2001, Zantzinger discussed the song with Howard Sounes for Down the Highway, the Life of Bob Dylan. He dismissed the song as a \"total lie\" and claimed \"It's actually had no effect upon my life\", but expressed scorn for Dylan, saying, \"He's a no-account son of a bitch; he's just like a scum of a scum bag of the earth.

It was recorded at the Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco in April 1972, with overdubs made later on. Morrison wrote it in a stream of consciousness in the same vein as some of his earlier works, particularly those on Astral Weeks. The  song's narrative moves from France to San Francisco, Morrison's place of residence at the time, to Belfast, where he grew up, to New York City (\"52nd Street apartment\").\nSaint Dominic's Preview has been described as one of his most allusive, containing wide-ranging references including The Troubles, Morrison's pre-fame career cleaning windows, Notre-Dame cathedral and the vicissitudes of the recording industry. The song also mentions Edith Piaf, Irish poet W. B. Yeats, country singer Hank Williams and the California supermarket chain Safeway. Gary Mallaber and Jack Schroer (from the Moondance album) play drums and saxophone respectively and Morrison's then wife, Janet Planet, is one of the back-up vocalists.\n\"Saint Dominic's Preview\" has also been released on the live recordings It's Too Late to Stop Now and Van Morrison in Ireland, as well as the compilation album Still on Top - The Greatest Hits.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_24134", "text": "It has been difficult for biographers and music reviewers to accurately identify some of the words used in \"Saint Dominic's Preview\"'s lyrics, as they were not published in the album sleeve at the time of its release. This led to some incorrect interpretations of the song before an official lyric sheet was published. The words emote different settings, but do not form an obvious story, as they describe a variety of subjects, such as cleaning windows, Edith Piaf's soul, W. B. Yeats and Hank Williams.\"Saint Dominic's Preview\" begins with references to Morrison's youth, working as a window cleaner in Belfast. He uses the word chamois (the leather used to clean windows) as a pun to link the French word to two aspects of French culture: singer Edith Piaf, with her song \"Non, je ne regrette rien\", and Cathedral Notre-Dame in Paris. The line \"It's a long way to Buffalo/It's a long way to Belfast city too\" is believed to refer to the homesickness that Morrison experienced living in the US at the time, because of the situation in Belfast. Whilst touring on the West Coast, drummer Gary Mallaber recalled a conversation he had with Morrison about how he missed Buffalo, New York: \"he wrote that [line] in 'Saint Dominic's Preview'. 'It's a long way to Buffalo/it's a long way to Belfast City too' \u2013 that was him crying out, saying, 'Well, you know what, I would like to return to my place too, 'cause I miss it.'\" Morrison revealed to journalists in 1972: \"I don't think I want to go back to Belfast. I don't miss it with all that prejudice around. We're all the same and I think it's terrible what's happening. But I think I'd like to get a house in Ireland. I'd like to spend a few months there every year.\"Morrison revealed that the song came to him in a stream of consciousness, but only found out afterwards that a mass that was  being held in a St. Dominic's church in San Francisco for peace in Belfast. He told John Grissim:\nI'd been working on this song about the scene going down in Belfast. And I wasn't sure what I was writing but the central image seemed to be this church called St Dominic's where people were gathering to pray or hear a mass for peace in Northern Ireland. A few weeks later I was playing at a gig in Reno, Nevada. I picked up a newspaper, and there in front of me was an announcement about a mass for peace in Belfast to be said the next day at St Dominic's Church in San Francisco. Totally blew me out. Like I'd never even heard of a St Dominic's Church.\nThere are also references to \"orange\" boxes, \"flags and emblems\" and people determined \"not to feel anyone else's pain\", which are seen by some as allusions to the situation in Belfast. Biographer Clinton Heylin thought that \"It was [a] surprising subject matter simply because of Morrison's long-standing decision not to address this volatile issue.\" Morrison later rejected the idea that the song had any political meaning, claiming that it was not written \"with anything in mind ... [it] is just a stream of consciousness. It doesn't mean any particular thing. It's a sketch ... the words, the syllables, just came out of my mouth and I wrote them down.\"In the lines \"You got ev'rything in the world you ever wanted/And right about now your face should wear a smile\", Morrison's personal life and successful career are covered, with references to the dishonesty of the music business, and his own self-pity and longing for a home that did not exist any more.Peter Mills identifies that the chorus is the element that brings the song together: \"Through it all, Saint Dominic's Preview remains. It is that which holds the song together, and unifies the apparently unconnected, resolving fracture through re-imagining what it means to belong: in this, the song is indeed a helpful observation of the situation in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_24135", "text": "\"Saint Dominic's Preview\" was recorded during the final session for the album at the Wally Heider Studios, San Francisco in April 1972.

Jim Gaines, employed at the Wally Heider Studios, was the engineer at the session. Pianist Tom Salisbury made the arrangements for the song, along with  \"I Will Be There\" and \"Redwood Tree\", which were also recorded at the final session. Salisbury had perfect pitch, which made it easy for him to write down the charts over the phone with instruction from Morrison. Salisbury was happy with the first take, even though ten takes were eventually made during the session. Doug Messenger recalled: \"When we recorded \"St. Dominic's,\" every take was more powerful that the last. Quite an experience. Mallaber kept driving the band harder and harder.\"Producer Ted Templeman and his assistant Donn Landee were not present at the recording of \"Saint Dominic's Preview\", but oversaw the overdubs and retakes that were made to the song.

'. The electric guitar had to be rerecorded because of unwanted sound leaking into the microphone. Doug Messenger was no longer part of Morrison's band when the overdubs were being recorded, so numerous guitarists, including Ronnie Montrose, were brought in to play it. None produced the sound wanted, so Messenger was recalled, and managed to complete the overdub to Morrison's satisfaction in one take. Morrison also rerecorded his vocals, which, over the new backing, allowed him to react more to the music; \"no regrets\" was replaced with \"ne regrette rien\" and the vowel sound of \"wine\" was elongated to \"wi-ee-ine\".

Spanning thirty years and four albums, the series comprises five parts, all of which carry unifying musical motifs. Parts I and II were released as the introductory and final tracks on King Crimson's 1973 album of the same name, part III was featured on their 1984 album Three of a Perfect Pair, part IV (itself divided into three identically titled parts) appeared on 2000's The Construkction of Light, and the final part, \"Level Five\", was included on the 2003 album The Power to Believe. Despite breaking the naming convention, Robert Fripp, King Crimson founder and only constant contributor to the suite, insists that \"Level Five\" is part of the pentalogy.\nIn 2011, PopMatters ranked the first part of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" as the eighth best progressive rock song ever.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_24301", "text": "\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\", the longest entry in the pentalogy, was first released as the introductory track to the album of the same name. The song is guided by the shifting guitar of Robert Fripp, but it is in the tense violin of David Cross and the chaotic percussion of Jamie Muir that Part I is defined.  The track goes through numerous varied acts and passages, with somber moments and a calm violin solo falling alongside periods of heightened aggression where Fripp's guitar borders on heavy metal and Muir's clangs reach cacophony. Bird calls, metallic clangs, horns, breaking crockery and tin ripping are all featured in Muir's repertoire, and, along with his percussive contributions, he coined the title \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\". In a 1991 interview, Muir said it was a \"very admirable creative decision\" for Fripp to work with him. Much of the track originated from full-band improvisations that began in 1971, with Cross calling it \"grown\" instead of written. Drummer Bill Bruford said the songs were \"hell\" to make given the deliberate lack of in-studio structure. An early version of Part I recorded by the 1971 lineup appeared as a bonus track on the 40th-anniversary edition of Islands under the name \"A Peacemaking Stint Unrolls\".\n\nWhile the first part is a many-sectioned, dynamic song that has been described as having a \"kitchen-sink sensibility\", \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\" is much more straightforward and riff-focused, with the sole writing credit going to Fripp. PopMatters called the track a \"roller-coaster of wrath and control\". The main riff of part II, which emerged in 1972 during a live performance at Richmond, Kentucky, is heavy and driving, drawing its host album to a dramatic climax. While the guitar in part II may be the most immediately obvious aspect, John Goldsby of Bass Player called the bass in the song something that \"bass players will still be talking about four decades later\". Fripp considered the first two parts of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" as the refinement of his role as composer in King Crimson.According to Fripp, Part I was conceived as the beginning of a King Crimson performance, and Part II as the end. \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\" was performed from 1972 to 1974, predominantly in a shortened seven-minute version that left out most of the violin solo and protracted ending passage. Part I was not performed again until 2014, when it was reintroduced as a setlist staple; it remained there through 2019. The new arrangement featured all of the violin segments played on guitar save for the solo, which was performed by Mel Collins on flute. Part II, alternatively, persisted in King Crimson's sets throughout most of their career.Both the first and second parts of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" have been met with critical acclaim. In 2011, Sean Murphy of PopMatters ranked the \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\" as the eighth best progressive rock song ever. He revised his placement in 2017, putting part I as number fifteen and \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\" as eighty-five. Marc Malitz of Louder Sound judged the first part as the forty-second best progressive song ever.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_24302", "text": "\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part III\" was released as the closing track on 1984's Three of a Perfect Pair.

Part III opens with the same melodic motif seen in parts I and II, but the rhythms and tones are significantly different, with Bruford playing a mix of acoustic and electronic drums.

Like part II, part IV is heavily guitar-driven, but it introduces new rhythmic and melodic motifs to the series, which would be explored further in part V. \"Coda: I Have a Dream\" shares some of the series' motifs, but also features lyrics and vocals from Adrian Belew. Though \"Coda\" was performed live with vocals in 2000, it was later performed live as an instrumental in 2001 and 2003.\nOn The Construkction of Light, \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic - Part IV\" is divided into three identically titled tracks that segue into \"Coda: I Have a Dream\", which is followed by a minute of silence.

The fifth part was ultimately released on 2003's The Power to Believe with the title \"Level Five\". Though nothing in the album's packaging confirmed that the song was part of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\", it shared elements of the series' rhythmic structure and form. While the relationship to the suite was hinted with an early 2001 tour jam combining a riff from part 1 of the suite with part of this piece, official confirmation only first appeared in the Elements 2017 box set, where it was included in sequence with the rest of the suite and called \"truly LTIA Pt V in all but name.\" The following year, Fripp confirmed that \"Level Five\" was indeed the fifth entry in the suite, but was renamed to \"unseat\" the expectations associated with the \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" title. It has since appeared on setlists and DGM Live downloads as \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part V\". The track is also listed on various streaming services as \"Level V\" with a Roman numeral, making it more consistent with the naming of the other parts.\n\"Level Five\" is a heavy guitar-driven track with glitchy and electronic drums that provide a rare, almost industrial groove. Several critics noted the sonic aggression of the song, and some compared the guitar interplay between Fripp and Belew as similar to the music on 1981's Discipline. AllMusic's Lindsay Planer called \"Level Five\" so intense \"that it could easily be mistaken for the likes of Tool, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, or KMFDM\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Tyler aimed to create an album utilizing the Wall of Sound production techniques of Phil Spector, and she believed that Steinman was the only person who could create the same sound, as Spector had mostly retired from the music business. Tyler visited Steinman in his apartment in New York in April 1982 with her manager, where she was presented with two tracks: \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\" and \"Goin' Through the Motions\". She stated that had she not liked the songs Steinman played for her, he would have rejected Tyler's invitation to collaborate. She returned to his studio apartment weeks later, where Steinman and Rory Dodd performed \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" for her. Steinman also hand-picked the recording band for the song, which included Dodd as a featured vocalist (the \"Turn around...\" refrain).The lyric \"Turn around, bright eyes\" had originally appeared in Steinman's 1969 college musical The Dream Engine.

Its lyrical and visual representations carry the common theme of virginal innocence, a continuation of 1999's teen-pop revival. It was produced to capitalize on the success of teen artists Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, who both debuted earlier that year. Sweet Kisses was a hit in the US, peaking at number 25 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over two million copies. As of February 2009, it has sold 1.9 million copies in the US.\nSweet Kisses spawned three singles, including Simpson's debut single: \"I Wanna Love You Forever\", which is her biggest hit in the US. The second single was a duet: \"Where You Are\" with future husband Nick Lachey of 98 Degrees. The third single was a dance track: \"I Think I'm in Love With You\", which samples \"Jack & Diane\" by John Cougar Mellencamp.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_24590", "text": "Simpson first developed and nurtured her talent in her local Baptist church, where her father also worked as the congregation's youth minister. At age twelve, she unsuccessfully auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club. While attending a church camp, at the age of 13, Simpson sang Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" and an arrangement of \"Amazing Grace\". One of the camp's visitors was launching a Gospel music record label and saw great promise and profits in her voice. It was during this time, while attending J. J. Pearce High School, Simpson signed to Proclaim Records, a minor Gospel music record label. She recorded an album, Jessica, but Proclaim went bankrupt and the album was never officially released except for a small pressing funded by her grandmother. This small pressing gained her minor attention which led her to performing at concerts with other gospel legendary acts such as Kirk Franklin, God's Property, and CeCe Winans. When she was seventeen years old, Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola heard Jessica, he was impressed with Simpson's musical talent and skill. Mottola instantly thought Simpson sounded like Mariah Carey. Simpson was immediately signed to the label. She dropped out of high school but later earned her GED.Simpson also collaborated with Sam Watters for the album. Watters produced the singles \"I Wanna Love You Forever\" and \"Where You Are\", as well as \"Heart of Innocence\". Watters also co-wrote the track \"I Wanna Love You Forever\", along with Louis Biancaniello. Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers also produced the tracks \"I've Got My Eyes On You\" and \"Betcha She Don't Love You\" together, though neither track was released as a single. Simpson's label wanted Sweet Kisses to be different from that of Aguilera's and Spears' debut albums, in that they were sexually risque, especially the lead singles from both albums. For Sweet Kisses, the label decided they wanted Simpson to be the \"anti-sex appeal\", to which Simpson would sing about love and romance rather than sexual themes. Simpson's \"virgin\" image was thought of as a great idea by the label, who felt that it would draw in listeners by making a girl whom they could relate to. Simpson also announced in an interview that she would be abstinent until marriage, which helped listeners give her the appearance the label was hoping for.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_24591", "text": "Sweet Kisses was released on 23 November 1999 through Columbia Records in United States, Canada, Australia and Europe.

She doesn't over-sing, like Aguilera occasionally does, even if she has moments where she pushes the envelope slightly \u2014 just like her idol Dion. However, there are already indications that she's developing her own voice, since she is equally capable of delivering danceable urban R&B (\"Final Heartbreak,\" \"I've Got My Eyes on You,\" the Destiny's Child duet \"Woman in Me\") as she is mature balladry (\"Faith in Me,\" the Nick Lachey duet \"Where You Are\"). Like most teen-pop albums, Sweet Kisses suffers from inconsistent material, yet the filler is well-produced and performed, making the record every bit as listenable as Aguilera's fine debut.\" People Magazine was less critical of the album, quoting \"Blonde, pouty-lipped and impossibly cute, Jessica Simpson is as tough to pick out of a lineup of lookalike teenage songbirds as her breathless hit \"I Wanna Love You Forever\" is difficult to differentiate from the rest of Top 40 radio. So far, Simpson's debut album hasn't scored the same success as those of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. But rest assured there are more cookies like \"I Wanna\" in Simpson's cutter. One ditty, titled \"Where Are You,\" is a duet with 98\u00b0 boy-toy Nick Lachey, Simpson's real-life squeeze. Unlike her peers the 19-year-old Simpson is not a former member of Disney's Mickey Mouse Club. She auditioned for the show at age 12 but didn't make the cut. Also setting her apart from the teen pop pack is Simpson's track record as a performer on the Christian music circuit. Here, she sounds downright worldly singing \"Heart of Innocence\"\u2014a devotional tune she wrote extolling the virtues of premarital abstinence\u2014in a low, sexy croon. Bottom Line: Teen yearnings set to a watery R&B beat.\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised Sweet Kisses as a hopeful debut when comparing her next album negatively to it.Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C\u2212, stating \"Jessica Simpson, a melodramatic 19, chirps cheeky Mariah Carey-isms on Sweet Kisses, a subpar portfolio, missing the soulful target almost every time. 'Do you wanna see the woman in me?/Let me show you,' she lasciviously hisses in one laughable instance, backed by a doo-wopping Destiny's Child. Uh, thanks, but no, kid. Been there, done that. Mom's waiting for you outside in the station wagon.\" Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice: \"Simpson is a blonde who got out of cheerleading early to prepare herself for whatever show business offered--game-show sidekick, R-rated remake of Debbie Does Dallas, bond trader seeking trophy wife. What she got was a John Cougar Mellencamp sample and the hard-earned ability to carry a tune. We know teenpop is rarely as vapid, prefab, and faux-wholesome as gatekeepers who've barely listened to it claim.

It was the first album to be released in the US by Virgin Records' new American imprint, Virgin Records America.\nBroadcast was re-released by Cherry Red Records on 24 May 2010, with bonus tracks including for the first time on CD \"For the Longest Time\", the B-side of \"(I Just) Died In Your Arms\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_24615", "text": "\"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\" reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart, and later on, \"I've Been in Love Before\" and \"One for the Mockingbird\" became top 10 and top 40 hits respectively across various countries. The band then received a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist of 1987. Despite all this, however, contemporary reception to the album was mixed from critics and muted commercially.\nBoth the album and the band have been looked upon more positively in hindsight. In a retrospective review, Michael Sutton of AllMusic gave the album four stars. He said the album \"never deserved the hacking [it] received from critics\", and said that \"the slick guitar rock on Broadcast may not have wowed the rock & roll intelligentsia, but it's a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, an underrated collection of simple, heartfelt love songs and up-tempo pop that reside between the stylistic boundaries of new wave and mainstream rock.\" He concludes the review by saying the album \"is not a creative breakthrough\", but is \"simply an LP absent of any filler.\"In the early '90s, the first seven tracks were included in the compilation album The Best of Cutting Crew, along with select songs from the follow-up studio album The Scattering (1989) and the single \"If That's the Way You Want It\" from Compus Mentus (1992).

The album opens with \"Perfection\", which was co-written and produced by Dan Carey. It features \"dreamy violin-laden confessions\" and was called a \"take on Misery-era Blonde Redhead\" by Drowned in Sound's John Calvert. \"Break the Chain\" references the singer's back injury following a dancing accident, where she refuses doctor's orders by continuing to pursue her dreams; it contains dubstep and flamenco \"undertones\" in addition to shackle sound effects. \"Sun of a Gun\" uses a metaphor regarding the orbit of the sun to describe being in love with someone who is \"destructive\" and \"dangerous\". The song's Europop sound was compared to the works of Kylie Minogue and Goldfrapp. The fourth track and third single, \"Voodoo\", is a synth-pop track that has Oh Land performing a \"spoken word verse over disco beats\". BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine wrote that the track's style was similar to the work of Marina and the Diamonds. He also compared the album's fifth track, \"Lean\", to Massive Attack's \"Teardrop\" (1998). \"Lean\" and \"Wolf & I\" are trip hop tracks, with the latter being described as dramatic by Gaffa's Michael Jose Gonzalez.\"Human\", the album's seventh track, is an emo-disco barnstormer\" that sounds Robyn-esque. Barry Walters from Spin stated that the song \"violates just as many grammar rules as the Killers\". \"White Nights\" is the fourth single and is lyrically about dreaming. As described by Leahey from AllMusic, the track blends Motown, synth-pop, and Tropic\u00e1lia into one song. \"Helicopter\" is the ninth track and is a collaboration between Oh Land and songwriter/producer Lester Mendez. It is reminiscent of Feist's work and features \"skittish electronics and dubby beats\". The following track is \"We Turn It Up\", which McAlpine considered \"perky enough to have served as a replacement for that Shakira World Cup song\".

It might just be that Oh Land is more skilled at getting songs to sound current than she is at expressing herself.\" Drowned in Sound's John Calvert called the album \"hip, diverse and always vibrant\", but also branded it \"pretty forgettable\". Calvert pointed out the production work of Dave McCracken and Dan Carey, noting the album \"inhabits a tepid middle ground between the two extremes\u2014offering neither gilded Scandi chart-pop (Robyn, Annie) or the artistic mettle of Scandi indie bands, most of whom are able to turn out sublime pop anyway.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

When you listen to 'That Within Blood Ill-Tempered', it's clearly more melody based... so a lot of my friends said: 'If you guys could combine the drive, the rock, and the aggression of \"Hearts\" and the structuring, the melody and the intelligence of \"That Within Blood Ill Tempered\", you might have my favorite album of all time.' So again, because I can never answer a question just directly, to answer your question directly, what we try to do is combine both albums. We wanted to make it smart, and heavy, we wanna make it sound great. We wanted to give something to people where they could groove along to it and rock for more than a second and a half without changing, but we also wanted to maintain some technical intelligent aspect, and the melodic nature of our last album.

When that didn't work, he might tell me a joke, or I might tell him one, hoping that joking would lead to some kind of song.  It didn't...And one afternoon, after we had just sat around throwing the bull, he said, \"I'm going to the office to make a few calls.

During two sessions on September 11\u201312, Nelson recorded \"Crazy\", \"Darkness on the Face of the Earth\", \"Three Days\", \"Funny How Times Slips Away\", \"Mr. Record Man\" and \"Hello Walls\". B. J. Baker led the vocal chorus that attempted to back Nelson, but the singer's idiosyncratic style gave them problems, as recounted by Nelson biographer Joe Nick Patoski: \"The singers got lost trying to follow Willie's lead vocals until Joe Allison put up some baffles between Willie and the singers so they couldn't hear one another.  To stay on the beat, the singers followed Johnny Western's direction.\"  The liner notes of the album were written by local DJ Charlie Williams, by request of Allison.  The album's biggest hit was \"Touch Me,\" a sad blues done in a slow drag with the rough edges smoothed out by harmony singers and a cool instrumental arrangement that reached the Top 10 and earned Nelson a place on jukeboxes throughput the United States.It was during the recording of \"Mr. Record Man\" that Nelson met his second wife Shirley Collie, with whom he would soon record the duet \"Willingly\", a Cochran composition.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_24654", "text": "The record was released in September 1962. \"Touch Me\" was released as a single, becoming Nelson's second top ten single, reaching No. 7 on Billboard's Hot Country Singles chart.

Orbison's recording of the song, produced by Fred Foster for Monument Records, was the first major hit for the singer. It was described by The New York Times as expressing \"a clenched, driven urgency\". Released as a 45 rpm single by Monument Records in May 1960, \"Only the Lonely\" went to No. 2 on the United States Billboard pop music charts on 25 July 1960 (blocked by Brenda Lee's \"I'm Sorry\") and No. 14 on the Billboard R&B charts. \"Only the Lonely\" reached number one in the United Kingdom, a position it achieved on 20 October 1960, staying there for two weeks (out of a total of 24 weeks spent on the UK singles chart from 28 July 1960). According to The Authorized Roy Orbison, \"Only the Lonely\" was the longest charting single of Orbison's career. Personnel on the original recording included Orbison's drummer Larry Parks, plus Nashville regulars Floyd Cramer on piano, Bob Moore on bass, and Hank Garland and Harold Bradley on guitars, Joe Melson and the Anita Kerr Singers on backing vocals. Drummer Buddy Harman played on the rest of the songs on the session.\nIn 1999, the 1960 recording of \"Only the Lonely\" by Roy Orbison on Monument Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_24671", "text": "After several years without much success in the music business, and sharing a tiny apartment with his wife and new baby, Roy Orbison had taken to sitting in his car to write songs when, in 1958, his acquaintance Joe Melson tapped on the car window and suggested they collaborate. With Chet Atkins producing, they recorded several songs for RCA Victor, only two of which were deemed worthy of release. Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of producer Fred Foster at Monument Records. There, Orbison would become one of the first recording artists to popularize the \"Nashville sound\".\nIn his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded \"Paper Boy\" (a song that RCA Victor had previously refused) while sound engineer Bill Porter experimented with close miking the doo-wop backing singers. Orbison requested a string section to perform in the studio, to augment the Nashville sound. The resulting recording had a \"polished, professional sound ... finally allow[ing] Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein\". With this combination, Orbison recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was \"Uptown\". Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, \"We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world.\" However, \"Uptown\" only reached number 72 on the Billboard Top 100, and Orbison set his sights on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere.\nIn early 1960, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote one more song, \"Only the Lonely\", which they tried to sell to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, who turned it down. (The song was subtitled \"Know The Way I Feel\" to avoid confusion with another song called \"Only The Lonely\", which Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen had written for Frank Sinatra in 1958.)\nInstead, they recorded \"Only the Lonely\" themselves at RCA's Nashville studio, using the string section and doo-wop backing singers that had given \"Uptown\" such an impressive sound. But this time, sound engineer Bill Porter tried a completely new strategy: building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background. This combination was to become Orbison's trademark sound.The recording also featured a falsetto note hit by Orbison that showcased a surprisingly powerful voice. According to biographer Alan Clayson, it \"came not from his throat but deeper within\". The song differed from the typical verse-chorus form structure of popular music of the time, building and falling to a climax, with emotional expression then rare for masculine performance.The single shot to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK, Ireland and Australia. According to Orbison, he and Melson now began constructing songs with Orbison's voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told Rolling Stone in 1988, \"I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Only the Lonely\", it kind of turned into a good voice.\" Instantly Orbison was in high demand. He appeared on American Bandstand and toured the U.S. for three months non-stop with Patsy Cline.

He was born with a severe hunchback, a bushy eyebrow covering his left eye while the right eye \"disappeared entirely\" behind a giant wart. He was born to a tribe of Romani people (in the novel called \u00e9gyptienne or 'gypsies'), but due to his monstrous appearance he was switched during infancy with an able-bodied baby girl, Agnes. One character in the novel refers to him as animalistic and un-Christian, suggesting he may be the \"offspring of a Jew and a sow\", and thus deserving of death. After being discovered, Quasimodo is exorcised by Agnes's mother (who believed that the Romani people ate her child) and taken to Paris. He is found abandoned in Notre Dame (on the foundlings' bed, where orphans and unwanted children are left to public charity) on Quasimodo Sunday, the First Sunday after Easter, by Claude Frollo, the Archdeacon of Notre Dame, who adopts the baby, names him after the day the baby was found, and brings him up to be the bell-ringer of the cathedral. Due to the loud ringing of the bells, Quasimodo also becomes deaf causing Frollo to teach him sign language. Although he is hated for his deformity, it is revealed that he is kind at heart. Though Quasimodo commits acts of violence in the novel, these are only undertaken when he is instructed by others.\n\nLooked upon by the general populace of Paris as a monster, he believes that Frollo is the only one who cares for him, and frequently accompanies him when the Archdeacon walks out of Notre Dame. Frollo lusts after a beautiful Romani girl named Esmeralda, and enlists Quasimodo in trying to kidnap her. (She is later revealed to be Agnes, the baby Quasimodo was switched with.) Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00e2teaupers arrives to stop the kidnapping and captures Quasimodo, unaware that Quasimodo was merely following Frollo's orders. The deaf judge Florian Barbedienne sentences him to an hour of flogging and another hour of humiliation on the pillory. Phoebus ties Quasimodo up and has Pierre Torterue whip him in front of a jeering crowd. When Quasimodo calls to him for help, Frollo allows Quasimodo to be tortured as punishment for failing him.  When Quasimodo calls for water, a child throws a wet rag at him. Seeing his thirst, Esmeralda approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him and she captures his heart.\nEsmeralda is later entangled in an attempted murder \u2013 committed by Frollo, who had stabbed Phoebus in a jealous rage after spying on Esmeralda and Phoebus having a night of passion \u2013 and is sentenced to be hanged. As she is being forced to pray at the steps of Notre Dame just before being marched off to the gallows, Quasimodo, who has been watching the occasion from an upper balcony in Notre Dame, slides down with a rope, and rescues her by taking her up to the top of the cathedral, where he poignantly shouts \"Sanctuary!\" to the onlookers below.\nEsmeralda is terrified of Quasimodo at first, but gradually recognizes his kind heart and becomes his friend. He watches over her and protects her, and at one point saves her from Frollo when the mad priest sexually assaults her in her room. In one instance Esmeralda also sees Phoebus from the cathedral balcony and pleadingly convinces Quasimodo to go down and look for him, but Phoebus is repulsed by Quasimodo's appearance and refuses to visit Notre Dame to see her.\nAfter an uneasy respite, a mob of Paris's Truands led by Clopin Trouillefou storms Notre Dame, and although Quasimodo tries to fend them off by throwing stones and bricks down onto the mob and even pours deadly molten lead, the mob continues attacking until Phoebus and his soldiers arrive to fight and drive off the assailants. Unbeknownst to Quasimodo, Frollo lures Esmeralda outside, where he has her arrested and hanged. When Quasimodo sees Frollo smiling cruelly at Esmeralda's execution, he turns on his master and throws him to his death from the balcony in rage.\nQuasimodo cries in despair, lamenting \"There is all that I ever loved!\" He then leaves Notre Dame, never to return, and heads for the Gibbet of Montfaucon beyond the city walls, passing by the Convent of the Filles-Dieu, a home for 200 reformed prostitutes, and the leper colony of Saint-Lazare. After reaching the Gibbet, he lies next to Esmeralda's corpse, where it had been unceremoniously thrown after the execution.

His annoyance became a jumping off point for a deeper examination of the state of his marriage. The lyrics acknowledge that the relationship is in trouble, and Lennon admits that he has hurt his wife, but he also resents the fact that she won't let him live down his mistakes. He also claims that those mistakes occurred long ago. According to pop historian Robert Rodriguez, the candidness of Lennon's exploration of his feelings give the song a potency that recalls songs from John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Walls and Bridges. Music critic Johnny Rogan also sees similarities with songs written during his mid-70s separation from Yoko Ono, when many the Walls and Bridges songs were written. And Lennon has confirmed that although the song was originally inspired by his feelings over the phone call, it also expresses his feelings about losing Yoko Ono during their 18-month separation (i.e., his lost weekend) as well as other losses, including the loss of his mother, which was the subject of several songs on John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band.The opening line in the song has the singer wondering why he went to the room of a \"stranger\" for comfort. It is left ambiguous whether the stranger is someone other than his lover, or whether the stranger is actually his lover, to whom he has become so alienated that she seems like a stranger. In another line, \"do you still have to carry that cross?\", the singer uses The Passion as a metaphor for his lover's refusal to forgive him.Another line from the song is \"here in the valley of indecision/I don't know what to do\". This is a reference to the title of the 1945 movie The Valley of Decision. Shortly after writing the song, Lennon explained to son Sean that he was often indecisive as a result of the pain he suffered when having to choose which parent to live with when his parents separated.Authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish say that the \"big\" drum sound and guitar part help create a \"tense atmosphere\", and liken the drum sound to production styles that became common later in the decade.An earlier version of the song was entitled \"Stranger's Room\".

Possible reasons for their exclusions are that Cheap Trick's management may have wanted too much money, or that Lennon believed that the performances were more \"heavy\" than he wanted. However, when the Double Fantasy version of \"I'm Losing You\" was recorded, the version with Cheap Trick's backing was played through the session musicians' headphones to help inspire their performances.

The search for a new guitarist was a drawn out process; Mustaine examined a number of guitarists for the job, including Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, who was initially offered the job before declining, as he requested that his Pantera brother, drummer Vinnie Paul, also be hired. Jeff Waters of Annihilator was also considered. Mustaine had asked original Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland to rejoin the band, with Poland tracking lead guitar parts on demo versions of all the songs that ended up on the studio album. According to Poland, he was \"99 percent going to join\" the band but was talked out of it by his manager. According to Mustaine, one of the last guitarists he had heard about, Marty Friedman, had sent him a copy of Dragon's Kiss, on which Friedman played. Upon listening to the record, Mustaine had Friedman come in to audition and hired him. This would become the band's first stable line-up and, as recognized by fans, the 'classic' Megadeth lineup.The album title Rust in Peace was inspired by a bumper sticker that Mustaine saw on the back of a vehicle while driving home from Lake Elsinore, California. The sticker read: \"May all your nuclear weapons rust in peace\". Mustaine liked the concept and decided to use it as a title for Megadeth's upcoming album. Rust in Peace was recorded at Rumbo Recorders with producer Mike Clink, while the mixing was handled by Max Norman. Clink was brought in for his work on both Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction and UFO's Strangers in the Night. The producer's work dealt mostly with the bass, drums and Friedman's guitar. In a 2002 interview, Mustaine declared that they \"really didn't make the record with [Clink]\" as at the time he was focused on Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and II \u2013 which were also being recorded at Rumbo \u2013 and stated most of the work in the album was done by himself, Norman, and engineer Micajah Ryan.The album artwork was created by artist Ed Repka, who previously had done the cover for Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? in 1986. It references \"Hangar 18\", and depicts band mascot Vic Rattlehead and world leaders of the era viewing an alien body. In addition to creating the album's cover, Repka also supplied artwork for the album's two singles. The object Rattlehead is holding was confirmed by Mustaine to be a material resembling Kryptonite.The men featured on the cover are, from left to right: an unidentified British representative, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, German President Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and United States President George H.

The Punishment Due\" finds its thematic inspiration derived from the Northern Ireland conflict, in which the largely Catholic nationalist community were in conflict with the mainly Protestant loyalist community over the sovereignty of the six counties of Northern Ireland. Mustaine has said that at a show in Antrim, Northern Ireland, he discovered bootlegged Megadeth T-shirts were on sale. He was dissuaded from taking action to have them removed on the basis that they were part of fund raising activities for \"The Cause\", explained as something to bring equality to Catholics and Protestants in the region. Liking how \"The Cause\" sounded as was explained to him, Mustaine dedicated a performance of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" to it, causing the audience to riot. The band were escorted in a bulletproof bus back to their hotel in Dublin after the show. This incident, along with Marvel's Punisher, inspired Mustaine to write the song.\"Rust in Peace... Polaris\", addresses the topic of nuclear warfare, with \"Polaris\" referring to the Cold War-era Lockheed UGM-27 Polaris intercontinental ballistic missile. Mustaine has revealed that the song, originally titled \"Child Saint\", was one of his earlier compositions, having been written before his tenure with Metallica (1982\u201383). Menza proposed the concept for \"Hangar 18\", a song about UFO conspiracies and Area 51.

Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune called it Megadeth's most accomplished album, praising its \"instrumental virtuosity, thoughtful lyricism and punkish rage\".Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone wrote that the album is demonstration of how far the \"nasty speed thrash\" concept can go without being \"formulaic and boring\". Reviewing the album for Entertainment Weekly, Jim Farber described the music as \"sheer velocity, combined with dexterity\" and Mustaine's lyrics as \"nihilistic whimsy\". Mike Stagno from Sputnikmusic agreed that the songwriting was \"top notch\" on the album, as well as the fast and technical musicianship. He also spoke highly of Friedman's and Mustaine's guitar performance, calling them \"one of the most potent duos in the scene\".Spin reviewer Tom Nordlie praised the album, deeming it a \"mature, complex, surprisingly consonant and sparely produced album\", and concluded that Rust in Peace \"never sleeps\". Music journalist Kim Cooper also noted the album's maturity and wrote that Rust in Peace \"transcended the hard rock genre and raised the bar to a whole new level\".

He went on to praise the Dust Brothers' production, the layers of samples, and felt the closing track \"B-Boy Bouillabaisse\" will \"probably change the face of all hip-hop for a long time to come\".

He overall considered the samples \"ill-matched\" and the group's performance subpar.Robert Christgau said although it \"doesn't jump you the way great rap usually does\", \"the Beasties and Tone-L\u014dc's Dust Brothers have worked out a sound that sneaks up on you with its stark beats and literal-minded samples, sometimes in a disturbing way.\" He commended them for \"bearing down on the cleverest rhymes in the biz\" and wrote, \"the Beasties concentrate on tall tales rather than boasting or dissing. In their irresponsible, exemplary way, they make fun of drug misuse, racism, assault and other real vices fools may accuse them of.\" In Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s (1990), he said the album's \"high-speed volubility and riffs from nowhere will amaze and delight you\", calling it \"an absolutely unpretentious and unsententious affirmation of cultural diversity, of where [the group] came from and where they went from there.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The other rock musician who sang with Jones was Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones on \"Say It's Not You\", which originally appeared on Jones's 1967 album If My Heart Had Windows.  In a 2004 interview that was posted on his website, Richards said of the meeting, \"That was a great experience...To sing with George \u2013 and get away with it! \u2013 was amazing.

All three went to Sacramento's C. K. McClatchy High School together, and participated in the city's skateboarding scene. Carpenter was a fan of heavy metal; Moreno was interested in hardcore punk bands such as Bad Brains as well as post-punk and new wave bands such as Depeche Mode and the Cure. When Moreno learned that Carpenter was a guitarist, he set up a jam session with Cunningham, who played drums. The trio began playing regularly in Carpenter's garage around 1988. They recruited bassist Dominic Garcia some time after, and the band became a four-piece. When Cunningham left Deftones to join Phallucy, another band from Sacramento, Garcia switched instruments and became the band's drummer. Chi Cheng filled the void as bassist, and the band recorded a four-track demo soon afterwards. Cunningham then returned to the band on drums, replacing Garcia.Regarding the recording, Cunningham said, \"At the time we did the first record \u2013 which I really like and think is good \u2013 you can tell the band was really young. We'd been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn't really think a whole lot about making the songs better\". Moreno felt that Adrenaline was recorded \"really fast\", and he performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure SM58 microphone.Although not specifically credited in the album's liner notes, it was stated that Frank Delgado contributed to the songs \"Minus Blindfold\" and \"Fireal\".

In his 1995 review, Kerrang!'s Paul Brannigan felt the album's sound \"falls between Quicksand and Tool\", and said Deftones \"explode from atmospheric croons into buck-mad rages\". He wrote, \"Excellent production from Terry Date allows the crisp guitar on 'Lifter' and '7 Words' to shine\", and that \"Bored\" and \"Nosebleed\" are \"just as blunt and angry, slabs of guitar crashing down on swirling, hypnotic rhythms.\" Brannigan rated it 4 out of 5 stars, saying it was \"Impressive.\" In 1995, Jon Wiederhorn of Pulse! stated that \"Adrenaline pitches between gloom-saturated melodies and explosive riffs, lashing out like a sleep-deprived paranoiac awakened by noisy neighbors. The rhythms are crisp and crafty and the vocals resonate both fury and sensitivity in a way that's similar to, but far more blatantly metallic than Nirvana\". Critic Katherine Turman wrote for Car Audio magazine in January 1996, \"If this is what heavy metal is evolving into, it's a damn good thing\".Giving the album 3 out of 4 stars in her 1996 review, Los Angeles Times critic Sandy Masuo praised the album's nuance and blend of musical extremes and various influences: \"On the outside, Sacramento's Deftones are all pummeling rhythms and high anxiety, but delving further into the music turns up some surprising nuances: traces of post-punk pop, tinges of rap, a pinch of industrial grit. Chino Moreno rants, sobs, croons and even works some Middle Eastern overtones into his vocals, while Stephen Carpenter's guitar shifts from coarse outbursts to crisp Helmet-ine precision. A bracing blend of extremes\". In his 1996 review, Tomas Pascual of Livewire magazine similarly noted the album's subtle yet diverse musical influences and the juxtaposition of loud and heavy with soft and melodic: \"There are many bands these days that lay claim to a diverse section of influences. But no one band is as subtly boisterous about their eclectic mix as are Deftones. [...] Deftones' course is piloted by vocalist and frontman Chino Moreno, who expresses his smooth, melodic lyrics emotionally one minute before giving way to abrasive, maddened screams the next. Backed by the serene and apocalyptic guitar of Stephen Carpenter, this Yin-Yang formula keeps Deftones' debut Adrenaline progressively contagious\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

By 1980, Greg Harris and Ed Ponder had left the group, leaving the Burritos as a trio of \"Sneaky\" Pete Kleinow, Gib Guilbeau and Skip Battin. In addition to commitments with the Flying Burrito Brothers, Guilbeau was also working as a songwriter for Criterion Music with John Beland, who Guilbeau knew from his time in the band Swampwater. Guilbeau and Beland wrote some songs and ultimately, Beland was invited to join the Burritos. Beland was reluctant to join the now nearly defunct band, as he was riding strong as lead guitarist with Ricky Nelson who (with Beland's help) was enjoying his own comeback of sorts.\nHowever, after leaving Nelson in the hopes of producing the Burritos, Beland took the Burritos in a more commercial direction, having already written a number of country hits for other artists prior to his joining the FBB. In addition, the band's name at this time was shortened to simply The Burrito Brothers, a suggestion made by Curb Records.\nBeland's song demos, which featured the Burritos on them, eventually made it to Dick Whitehouse at Curb records, who signed the band to a deal with Curb / Epic Records. By December 1980, the band's first single for Curb, \"She's a Friend of a Friend\" reached the US country top 70. Hearts on the Line followed in January 1981 and spawned two further singles, both of which made the US country top 20, \"Does She Wish She Was Single Again?\" and \"She Belongs to Everyone But Me\". More would follow.\nThat year, The Burrito Brothers received the number one \"Crossover from pop to country\" award from Billboard Magazine as well as best new vocal group award from Record World Magazine. But Skip Battin was fired from the band after the photo shoot for the album cover of Hearts on the Line, and was replaced in the studio by Dennis Belfield on bass. Mickey McGee was also replaced on drums by Ron Krasinsky, for the recordings.

The album marked a musical shift away from their earlier work; despite being critically lauded, fan reaction to it was highly negative. While touring the album, the material came across as too mellow and quiet, which made for lackluster live performances, according to vocalist/guitarist Matt Pryor. In August, the group went on a European tour, playing shows in Germany, Belgium and the UK. The tour was to include additional shows in Italy, Switzerland and Amsterdam, but were left out due to time constraints. They were also due to perform shows as part of a Vagrant Records tour in the US, as well as further European shows, but were abandoned due to scheduling conflicts, resulting in the band staying at home.

Around this time, they were in the middle of acquiring the studio Red House Recordings in Eudora, Kansas.The band had previously made albums in places such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Bridgeport, and wanted to make one near to their home. The opportunity to purchase Red House came about when they wanted to work more with Ed Rose, who they had known for several years, and asked the owner if he wanted to sell it. To help fund the purchase, the group sold their Heroes & Villains Records imprint to Vagrant Records, citing a lack of responsibility and interest in it, in addition to Vagrant wanting 100% ownership of its releases. During some midwestern US shows in November and December, and Canadian shows in March, the band debuted two new songs: \"Wouldn't Believe It\" and \"Sick in Her Skin\".

The group began doing pre-production in April 2003, listening to around 20 demos at drummer Ryan Pope's house. By the end of the month, they had tracked scratch guitar and vocals for 13 songs. The process consisted of Pryor playing to a click track, Rose and Pope would build drum tracks over. By early May, the drums were recorded for 13 songs, with guitar, bass and vocals only being finished for a few of them. Around this time, Jason Russell of Hot Rod Circuit was in the city to practice with Pryor's other band the New Amsterdams, and ended up singing on \"Man of Conviction\", the only track finished up to that point.The group took a short two week break as most of the members went on holiday. They began tracking again in early June, and continued into July. They worked on some new songs, alongside a few by guitarist Jim Suptic. The members initially listened to the demos of these new songs and thought how to approach them, before playing them in the studio's live room as a full group, marking it one of a handful of times the whole band were in the studio together for the album. At the end of June, keyboardist James Dewees tracked his parts; he had little time to do this due to his project Reggie and the Full Effect was due to start touring in early July. Overall, Dewees finished around 95% of his parts before embarking on tour.Suptic laid down his guitar parts in August while both the New Amsterdams and Reggie were on tour. Pryor later recorded piano, for \"The Dark Night of the Soul\", and backing vocals, for \"Holy Roman\", at his home in Lawrence, Kansas. Pryor and Rob Pope recorded a drum machine and vocals for \"Is There a Way Out\" in the basement of Pope's house. Rob and Ryan Pope recorded bar noise for \"Martyr Me\" at The Free State Brewery. Jeremy Goldstein, who worked at Quadrant 5 Studios, did sound manipulation on \"The Dark Night of the Soul\". Recording wrapped up in October with 58 days in total spent recording; 18 songs had been tracked altogether. Shortly afterwards, Rose mixed the recordings.

The album was far less collaborative than their previous works, many songs being written and demoed by Pryor, then fleshed out by the rest of the band. During the writing, the group was listening to the Clash and Elvis Costello and the Attractions. They wanted more upbeat songs that would work well live, citing a return to the sound of Something to Write Home About (1999). Pryor was at the happiest point of his life up to that point, but thought that it would not work well lyrical and started writing about other people's relationships. He claimed there was \"hardly\" anything on the album relating to his life. He stated that Pope's divorce was \"pretty heavy shit to have gone through. So yeah, it made for good lyrical fodder.\" Pope said the theme and overall tone of the songs changed following it: \"It made everyone step back and go, 'Wow. Okay.' It\u2019s a big thing.\" Additionally, a lot of the album talks about conflict between friends.The album's title stemmed from an occasion where Rob Pope and Rose were driving to the studio. They passed a church that said \"annual quilt show\", which the pair misread as \"annual guilt show\". Discussing the meaning, Pryor said there was a lot of lyrics referring to \"betrayal in one form or another, and guilt seems to go hand-in-hand with betrayal.\" \"The One You Want\" is about a woman that Pryor wishes he never met: \"She sucks the soul out of people, and she spends all of my friend's money on drugs and stupid sh--.\" He referred to it as \"'77 era\" power pop. \"Wouldn't Believe\" is about an occurrence of adultery that eventually ends in divorce. Pryor found \"Holy Roman\" to be a departure from his usual writings due to its political nature. It was influenced by him becoming a father, stating his awareness of the political climate in the world outside of life in a band. \"How Long Is Too Long\" talks about a man who sleeps with another guy's partner. The track was the first of two written during the On a Wire sessions, but were left off as they didn't fit the style of that record. \"Sympathy\", the second track written during the On a Wire sessions, has been referred to by Pryor as \"'97 era\" indie rock.

It was released by Capitol Records on October 18, 2013. While the album was initially planned to be \"darker\" than her previous material, Prism ultimately became a prominently dance-inspired record. Perry worked with several past collaborators, while enlisting new producers and guest vocals. Much of Prism revolves around the themes of living in the present, relationships, and self-empowerment. The album garnered generally positive reviews with critics praising its lyrics for being more \"mature\" and personal, while others considered Prism to be more formulaic than her previous material.\nThe album debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with 286,000 copies sold, becoming Perry's best opening week to date. The album also peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Prism became Perry's fastest-selling album, the second best-selling album in Australia in 2013, and the second best-selling album released by a woman in the United States in 2013. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that Prism was the sixth best-selling album in the world in 2013, the best-selling album in the world in 2013 released by a woman, and labeled Perry \"a global phenomenon.\" It has sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The album's success continued throughout 2014, ranking within the top 10 of the annual charts for 2014 in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and earned Perry a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.\nThe release of the album was preceded by the release of two singles. \"Roar\" was released on August 10, 2013, as the album's lead single and topped the Billboard Hot 100. \"Unconditionally\" debuted on October 16, 2013, as the record's second single. In between the release of these two tracks were the releases of promotional singles \"Dark Horse\" on September 17 and \"Walking on Air\" on September 30, 2013. \"Dark Horse\" was released as the album's third single three months later on December 17, 2013, and also reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Birthday\" and \"This Is How We Do\" were the fourth and fifth singles, respectively.

If I had a time machine and could go back in time, I would. But I can't, so, you'll discover another part of me.\" To Interview, she mentioned that she aspired to include a more acoustic vibe to the record.Perry also said that her music would be getting \"real fucking dark\" and \"shoegazing\", though also stated that her fans would be able to relate to it. \"I imagine that maybe my next record would be a little bit more of an artistic venture,\" she said. \"Not that I'm going to self-sabotage either and be like, 'I'm going to make a crazy record that nobody really understands.'\" That fall, she later told Billboard about her plans for the album, saying she already envisioned several aspects of it. Perry told the magazine that she already had songs and ideas, and knew the type of record she would make next. She also said that although she had not started recording yet, she already knew how the artwork, coloring and tone of the album would turn out.

She began with a process she deemed \"slow cooking\", which consisted of recording random \"fragments of ideas\" into her mobile phone's dictaphone application. A member of Direct Management Group, Ngoc Hoang, then transcribed the audio files, which he inserted into what Perry described as a \"treasure chest\"; such object was consulted by Perry later on during the album's recording sessions. While Perry started recording the album officially in November 2012, accompanied by Greg Wells and Greg Kurstin, she noted she was still in a \"dark place\", and that she had not \"let the light in\". The sessions began again in March 2013, following a trip to Madagascar which Perry credited as having \"put [her] priorities in perspective\", thus leading her to \"do more work on [her]self\". Perry also viewed a video made by Eckhart Tolle, which discusses loss. She commented: \"When you lose something, all your foundations crumble\u2014but that also leaves a big hole that's open for something great to come through.\"After feeling prepared to record again, she reunited with her team from Teenage Dream\u2014Dr. Luke, Bonnie McKee, and Cirkut\u2014in Perry's hometown of Santa Barbara, California, where they spent a month recording at Playback Recording Studio among others. After those sessions, she went to Stockholm, where she worked with Scandinavian record producer Max Martin, to do what Perry called \"put[ting] the ice on the cake\". She also recruited other collaborators, such as Norwegian team Stargate, Bloodshy, Benny Blanco, Jonatha Brooke and Sia. By April 2013, recording for the album was halfway complete, and Perry revealed to ASCAP how was working with such collaborators. She affirmed that Wells allowed her to \"vomit words\"; with Martin, she picked the melodies of the songs; Luke mostly helmed the production and she worked with \"topline and melody\". Perry described writing sessions with McKee as \"emotional abuse\", adding that they argue over the \"best lyric\", as if they were fighting in a boxing ring. McKee, who wrote four songs for Prism, spoke with MTV on the effort, describing it as \"a little bit more grown up\" and \"interesting\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_25124", "text": "The album opens with \"Roar\", a midtempo synth-driven power pop track. Musically, it contains elements of arena rock and glam rock, while lyrically it is an empowerment anthem. Comparisons were established between \"Roar\" and \"Brave\" by Sara Bareilles. \"Legendary Lovers\", a bhangra-based song, deals with the concepts of karma and infinity. \"Birthday\" was described by Perry as her own attempt at \"writing something Mariah Carey would have put on her first record\". Musically, it is a \"fluffy\" pop song that is primarily styled in the genre of disco. \"Walking on Air\", the album's second promotional single, is an early 1990s-inspired deep house-Eurodance-disco song, inspired heavily by CeCe Peniston and Crystal Waters. It was produced by Klas \u00c5hlund and Max Martin. \"Unconditionally\", Perry's personal favorite song on the album and second official single, is a \"soaring\" power ballad with an \"epic chorus\". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard noted that the song includes a \"woodblock percussion\" as well as \"a dramatic bass line\" and deemed it the album's \"most mature offering\". Furthermore, he called it \"an ode to love that looks past all flaws\" and stated that the song acts as a \"compellingly grounded predicate\" to the title track from Teenage Dream. Perry herself described the song as a song about unconditional love that could come in all forms, including those from relationships, from parent-to-child, and from sibling-to-sibling.\"Dark Horse\" is a song with ample influences of trap, grime, hip hop, and \"Southern rap-techno mashup\" genres. \"This Is How We Do\", produced by Max Martin and Klas Ahlund, was described as being the possible \"song of summer\" for 2014. Shirley Halperin from The Hollywood Reporter described \"This Is How We Do\" as \"a sunny 80s throwback\", while Edna Gundersen from USA Today described it as a \"buoyant pop blast with hip-hop underpinnings\" and praised the song's recurring refrain (\"It's no big deal!\"). James Montgomery from MTV News called the song a \"cocksure, club-ready banger\". With \"Double Rainbow\", produced by Greg Kustin and co-writer Sia, Perry was allowed to \"dump pent-up emotions\" and \"get things off her chest\". The song was described as a \"massive ballad\". Lipshutz deemed it as a \"breathy love track\" with a \"powerful chorus that explodes upon impact\" with lyrics that include \"One man's trash is another man's treasure / so if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever\". He added that \"Kurstin brings the pop sensibility he's flashed with artists like Kelly Clarkson and P!nk, while Sia's presence connects this sleek, shimmering pop track to [her David Guetta collaboration] 'Titanium'\". Elijah Sarkesian felt that \"Some of Katy's finest vocals of the album are on this song\".Perry described \"Love Me\" as a song \"about loving yourself the way you want to be loved\". Gundersen called it \"irresistibly catchy and energetic\". The song was produced by Bloodshy. Sarkesian called it \"an interesting mix \u2013 the lyrics are dark, but the music is very dance-centric. At the very least, it'll do well in clubs\". Montgomery stated that \"Love Me\" and \"International Smile\" both \"seem destined for the dance floors\". The latter was inspired by Perry's friend Mia Moretti, and was compared to the songs on Perry's previous album. Lipshutz called it a \"straightforward pop-rock offering\" and described its guitar hook as \"kicky\", adding that the song also includes a \"Melting Daft Punk-esque vocoder breakdown\". Halperin stated that in the song, Perry sings the \"hooky\" line: \"Please fasten your seat belts and make sure your champagne glasses are empty\".Halperin described \"This Moment\" and \"Ghost\" as \"mid-tempo ballads that are closest in DNA to Perry's previous smashes\". Perry stated that she was inspired to write \"This Moment\" after she heard the audio book of The Power of Now; the song's lyrics talk about \"living in the present\"; with Perry \"add[ing] a romantic spin\" to it. Gary Trust described \"Ghost\" as a \"mesmerizing ballad\", while Gundersen described it as \"powerful, dark, and haunting\". Lipshutz felt that \"Ghost\" and \"By the Grace of God\" contain the album's \"most somber moments\". While talking about each Prism track, Perry mentioned that \"By the Grace of God\" was the first song she wrote and recorded for the album back in November 2012 while she was in her \"dark\" phase. Jody Rosen from Vulture described bonus track \"Spiritual\" as an inspirational song. Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast described \"It Takes Two\" as a \"sweeping ballad\" which allowed Perry to \"show off a full-throated belt that so many of her more bubbly tracks mask\".

Consequently, they booked the show at Leeds University, along with one at Hull City Hall the following day, specifically to record a live album. Six songs were taken from the Leeds show, and the cover was pressed to look like a bootleg recording.

According to biographer Chris Charlesworth, \"a sixth sense seemed to take over\", leading them to \"a kind of rock nirvana that most bands can only dream about\". The band were rehearsing and touring regularly, and Townshend had settled on using the Gibson SG Special as his main stage instrument; it allowed him to play faster than other guitars. He began using Hiwatt amplifiers that allowed him to get a variety of tones simply by adjusting the guitar's volume level.The group were concerned that Tommy had been promoted as \"high art\" by manager Kit Lambert and thought their stage show stood in equal importance to that album's rock-opera format. The group returned to England at the end of 1969 with a desire to release a live album from concerts recorded earlier in the US. However, Townshend balked at the prospect of listening to all the accumulated recordings to decide which would make the best album, and, according to Charlesworth, instructed sound engineer Bob Pridden to burn the tapes, an order Townshend retrospectively called \"one of the stupidest decisions of my life.\"Two shows were consequently scheduled, one at the University of Leeds and the other in Hull, for the express purpose of recording and releasing a live album. The Leeds concert was booked and arranged by Simon Brogan, who later became an assistant manager on tour with Jethro Tull. The shows were performed on 14 February 1970 at Leeds and on 15 February at Hull, but technical problems with the recordings from the Hull gig \u2014 the bass guitar had not been recorded on some of the songs \u2014 made it all the more necessary for the show from the 14th to be released as the album. Townshend subsequently mixed the live tapes, intending to release a double album, but then decided on a single album with six tracks. The full show opened with Entwistle's \"Heaven And Hell\" and included most of Tommy, but these were left off the album in place of earlier hits and more obscure material.

As Rothchild himself recalled, \"I'd ask Jim to get out his notebooks of poetry and we'd go through them and find a piece that fit rhythmically and conceptually. A lot of the fragments there were just bits of poetry we put together.\" The lyrics draws comparison to William Blake as well as T. S. Eliot's poem \"Ash Wednesday\", much like many other selections of Morrison's poetry, which are heavily influenced by other poets and authors, notably \"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\" and \"Not to Touch the Earth\".\"The Soft Parade\" itself was an expression coined by Morrison to indicate the bizarre and varied humanity that populated Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles daily. His lyrics express need and pursuit for sanctuary, escape, and pleasure from his point of view. At the beginning of the song, Morrison starts out defiantly with spoken words reminiscent of a Christian revivalist preacher. The track then goes into a harpsichord driven semi-introductory piece with lyrics such as, \"Can you give me sanctuary? / I must find a place to hide\" referencing Morrison's then-current problems, most notably his arrests during the Miami and New Haven concerts.

Released in May 1994, it is considered one of Nine Inch Nails' signature songs and remains their most popular song. Most versions of the single are titled \"Closer to God\", a rare example in music of a single's title differing from the title of its A-side (\"Closer to God\" is also the title of an alternate version of \"Closer\" featured on the single, which was also released as a separate promotional single for club-play).

Although the song addresses themes such as self-hatred and obsession, its sexually aggressive chorus led to widespread misinterpretation of the song as an anthem of lust, which helped it become Nine Inch Nails' most successful single up to that time and cemented Trent Reznor's status as an industrial rock icon. Commercially, \"Closer\" reached No. 41 on the US Billboard Hot 100, No. 25 on the UK Singles Chart, and No. 3 on the Australian Singles Chart.

The drum track of \"Closer\" is built around a heavily modified sample of the bass drum from the 1977 Iggy Pop song \"Nightclubbing\", which was performed by a Roland drum machine. The samples were produced using two Akai S1100 samplers, each with an expander, essentially making up four samplers. The samples were then combined with beats produced by a Roland R-70 drum machine. The production features sound effects such as a bass squelch, synth echo, and feedback growl. Radio edits of \"Closer\" were created by muting the vocal track for the duration of each deleted obscenity.Lyrically, \"Closer\" is a song about self-hatred and obsession; to Reznor's dismay, the song was widely misinterpreted as a lust anthem due to its chorus, which famously includes the lines \"I wanna fuck you like an animal / I wanna feel you from the inside\". In 2003, VH1 ranked the song at No. 93 in its countdown of the \"100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years.\" The song was ranked at No. 2 on AOL's \"69 Sexiest Songs of All Time\" due to the explicit frankness of the chorus.

It was cut down from its original length to 4:36. Several sections of the video were shot inside the then-abandoned Linda Vista Community Hospital in Los Angeles. The video was popular and helped bolster the success of the band. Set in what appears to be a 19th-century mad scientist's laboratory, the video's imagery involves religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror, including:\n\nA heart connected to some sort of device; the beat of the heart corresponds to the beat of the song\nA little girl lounging on a chair\nA nude, bald woman with a crucifix mask\nA monkey, scared, panicked, tied to a cross with a picture of Jack Nicholson (photograph taken by David Bailey) on the right.\nA severed pig's head spinning on some type of machine.\nA diagram of the vulva/vagina\nReznor wearing various fetish gear, such as an S&M mask, ball gag, and long leather gloves while swinging in shackles.Several times, Reznor, wearing leather pants, floats and rotates through the air, suspended by invisible wires.

Mark has stated: \n\nWe made prints, and I personally spent a couple of days dragging them around the parking lot and spraying aerosol shellac and holding lighters under them. We were just making it for art's sake, and YouTube didn't exist then, so it was a pretty ballsy and extravagant thing for Trent to do. But MTV liked it, so that started a long negotiation of how we can get it on the air. I want to go on record about the monkey: That monkey was not in any danger even though he appears to be in distress. The monkey was just munching on bits of banana and enjoying himself. We had an ASPCA person on the set. It wasn't harmed, and actually got paid more than some of the crew.\nThese images were inspired by the work of Joel-Peter Witkin, as well as by the Brothers Quay's animated short film Street of Crocodiles. For the television version, certain removed scenes were replaced with a title card that read \"Scene Missing,\" and the instances of the word fuck being edited out were accompanied by a stop in the video motion, making it appear as if the stop was a result of defective film (this was supposedly done to make sure the flow of the song was not affected). According to Romanek, the video was filmed using \"a slightly out of date film stock but it was still a contemporary film stock.\"\n\nThey had stopped making it three years before and we found some of it. All the new color film stocks have this T-Grain, like little Ts that are interlocking. The film stock we used had the original old granular grain. The new stocks are just really modern looking, really sharp, really contrasty, very fine grain. We didn't want that. Normally you don't want to use that kind of stock because the colors will be off. It does have a shelf life but in this case we didn't care, the more fucked up it was the happier we were.\nThe unedited version of the video was shown on Playboy TV's music video show Hot Rocks in 1994. In mid-2002, the unedited version aired on MTV2 as part of a special countdown showcasing the most controversial videos ever to air on MTV.

After signing to Independiente, they took time working on new material, until early 2004, when they recorded their next album at Olympic Studios in London with producer Martin \"Youth\" Glover. Out of Nothing is an indie rock album that drew comparison to the works of Coldplay and Keane.\n\"Gravity\" was released as the lead single from Out of Nothing in August 2004; shortly afterwards, Embrace went on a tour of the United Kingdom. \"Ashes\" appeared as the album's second single in November 2004 in the midst of another UK tour.

They held two shows at the Millennium Square in Leeds, dubbed A Glorious Day, in May 2005; coinciding with this, \"A Glorious Day\" was released as the album's fourth and final single.\nOut of Nothing received generally favourable reviews from critics, many of whom praised the high-quality songwriting, while others felt it sounded uninspired. It topped the album charts in both Scotland and the UK, while also charting in Germany and Ireland. The album was certified gold a few days after its release, and has been certified double platinum as of 2021. All of the album's singles reached the top 30 in the UK, and the top 10 in the Scotland; \"Gravity\" peaked the highest in both territories, with number two in Scotland and number seven in the UK.

Despite this, the band were dropped from the roster by Hut and Virgin Records less than a month later. The band promoted the album with a tour of the United Kingdom at the end of the year, with a shorter UK tour following in early 2002. While making If You've Never Been, frontman Danny McNamara said they had gathered enough material that they were considering releasing its follow-up in early 2002. In between the two UK tours, the band spent some time recording new material.Hut Records released the band's first compilation album, Fireworks: The Singles 1997\u20132002, in March 2002; McNamara explained: \"I see the next phase of Embrace as being quite separate and different from what the band has done up until now and this album is us signing-off on the past\". Cam Lindsay of Exclaim! wrote that the career of acts hyped up by the Britpop and post-Britpop scenes was \"so short it left many bands and their second albums for dead\".

After leaving Hut, some of the members were forced to get day jobs. McNamara said label chairman Andy MacDonald was a fan of theirs and had seen them a few times prior. McNamara mentioned that he had been spending sometime in London writing material while the other members were building a recording studio, and that they were aiming to release a new single later in the year. According to McNamara, MacDonald told the band he was impressed with their live performances and that they had high-quality songwriting but had \"never made a classic album\", which was something he wanted for the label. He was content with them taking as long as they wanted for as much money as they needed.Drummer Mike Heaton said they did not have the means of writing songs in peace previously, often feeling stressed while out touring. In December 2003, the band played a few shows under the moniker the Good Good People; McNamara explained that he had spent the \"last two years doing nothing but writing songs\".  At MacDonald's suggestion, they worked with producer Martin \"Youth\" Glover, with whom they previously worked with earlier in their career. Bassist Steve Firth said by this point, they had grown accustomed to outside opinions, something they used to block out, allowing for an easier process when working with Youth. After New Years Day 2004, the band began recording at Olympic Studios in London.Clive Goddard served as engineer, while Paul \"P Dub\" Walton recorded the strings; they were assisted by Phillipe Rose, Sam Miller and Bea Kenkel. McNamara said Youth \"broke us into pieces, and then re-built us as a new band almost\", expressing interest in wanting him for their next album. While in the mixing process, the band were offered the song \"Gravity\" by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. As the process was almost done, they had disregarded the suggestion as guitarist Richard McNamara said they \"had so much faith in what we\u2019d already recorded, the potential backlash just didn\u2019t seem necessary\". After an evening of contemplation, they decided to use the song. Heaton had to do some post-production work on \"Looking as You Are\" as they had recorded the song at the wrong tempo, prompting them to slow the track's speed down without sacrificing the quality of the recording.

Shortly after this, the band played a one-off show in Brighouse, Yorkshire on 15 August 2004 to celebrate their 10th anniversary, which saw the debut of material from Out of Nothing. They appeared a V Festival a few days later after Jet pulled out because of a death in the family. Shortly after this, Embrace partially played a fan club gig in London that was ultimately shut down by the police. They promoted the \"Gravity\" single with a one-off show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire venue in London, prior to the release of Out of Nothing on 13 September 2004. The artwork shows the members of the band embracing one another.To promote the album, the band told fans via text messages about secret gigs they were holding, one of which including a performance in Mallorca. Later that month, they embarked on a UK tour that ran into October 2004. Following this, they went on a longer UK tour throughout November 2004. On 15 November 2004, a special edition of Out of Nothing was released, featuring a DVD with footage of their secret gigs from two months prior. This edition also included a special code that fans could use to enter into a competition for addition secret shows at the end of the year. The band promoted it two in-store signing sessions in Leeds, Birmingham and Liverpool. They closed out the year appearing at a benefit gig for Shelter, alongside Kasabian and the Zutons, and a secret show at the Carnglaze Caverns in Cornwall.Billboard reported in their 12 February 2005 issue that Embrace had signed to Lava Records for releases in the North American market. Between February and April 2005, Embrace went on another tour of the UK, played their first ever shows in the United States and then two gigs in Ireland. After this, Embrace went on a tour of the US with Snow Patrol in April and May 2005. Following a warm up gig at a fan's house, the band played two hometown shows in Leeds at the Millennium Square, which were dubbed A Glorious Day, at the end of May 2005. They were supported for the first show by the Ordinary Boys, the Subways, Hard-Fi and Anechoic, while other show feature Thirteen Senses, the Engineers and Infrasound. After initially planned for release in the US on 3 May 2005, Out of Nothing was eventually released there on 14 June 2005.

It was packaged with a three-track CD that featured live versions of \"Gravity\", \"A Glorious Day\" and \"Keeping\". The Mallorca performance was also released on DVD in 2005, this time through Independiente. That same year, Coldplay released their own version of \"Gravity\" as the B-side to their song \"Talk\". Embrace held special shows in March 2020 where they played songs exclusively from their The Good Will Out and Out of Nothing albums. In October 2020, the band held a livestream performance where they played Out of Nothing in its entirety. To coincide with the latter, Out of Nothing and their fifth studio album This New Day (2006) were re-pressed on vinyl in 2020 through Craft Recordings; this version was done as a single-disc, in contrast to the double-disc version of the original 2004 Independiente edition.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_25199", "text": "Out of Nothing was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics.

The staff at AllMusic called it a \"batch of well crafted songs tailor-made for the charts\", praising the \"euphorically expansive production\".

It peaked at number 14 on the Billboard 200 and was his final studio album for long-time label Warner Bros. Records.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "175_25204", "text": "After the relative success of You're the One, which was released in late 2000 finding Simon back to the Top 20 of the American charts after ten years of absence and also receiving a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year, Simon spent most of the following two years promoting the album. In 2002, he took a year off, and during 2003 and 2004 had a widely documented reunion with Art Garfunkel. This was followed by a Simon & Garfunkel Old Friends Reunion Tour from October\u2013December 2003, as well as June and July 2004, where the duo extensively toured America and Europe and the concerts in New York in December 2003 were registered on both a live album and video that was released by the end of the year. Also in December 2004, Paul Simon's studio albums were re-released in remastered issues, as well as re-promoted.\nAt this point, Simon was fully involved in the writing and recording of a new studio album. He was introduced to Brian Eno, producer of Talking Heads and U2 among others.\nAccording to Simon, one of the first songs written for the album was \"Wartime Prayers\", which became one of the most celebrated tracks of the album and later a concert favorite. Simon commented that, in some kind of premonition, the song was written even before the Iraq invasion in 2003. Soon after, early recording for the album began. The album was recorded in London, New York and Nashville. Simon first met with Brian Eno in London to discuss a collaboration between Eno's electronic production and Simon's classic guitar folk-rock. As Simon said, \"We spent some time in his studio and decided to combine our visions. It took about two years. The actual time I spent with Brian was 20 days, split into four periods. We found we could really work intensely for five days, and after that it was a bit of a burnout.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "175_25205", "text": "In personal terms, Simon was inspired by the fact of being over sixty years old \u2013 an age that he turned in 2001 and that he humorously referred already on his single \"Old\", from the You're the One album.\nIn the way of the songs were written, Simon stated \u2013 \"I start with the rhythm. It's drums first, then I go to key to sound to guitar to the form of the song to the beginning of the melody. As the melody begins, so do the words. That's how it's been since Graceland. I write backward.\" Simon was particularly grateful with the results of the songs written considering of his age.\n\nI'm much more judgmental these days. Finishing a song is more satisfying now because I'm grateful, whereas when I was 28, I expected it. Now if I find something to say, and I say it in a way that I think is artful and true, I'm relieved I wasn't frustrated or stymied. When I was younger, I just said whatever I had to say. I ask myself now: Do I deeply believe that? Will anybody get it? Am I just talking to myself? You have to put that aside because it's not very helpful.\n[...] I'm trying to be as honest as I can expressing myself musically and lyrically, editing out what might be considered obscure but not trying to oversimplify or be condescending. And then I have to let go, even if I don't immediately understand the words. What I meant eventually reveals itself. You can be too familiar with the process, which I've been doing since I was 15. Sometimes, instead of manipulating the craft, you have to just be the vessel through which some sort of inspiration will flow. With this record, it took me a while to map out a path.\nSimon showed special care about the musical venture he traveled since 1986's Graceland. As he put it, \"Once you go away for a bit, you wonder who people think you are. If they don't know what you're up to, they just go by your history. I'm so often described as this person that went to other cultures, which is true, but I never thought of it that way. I suspect people are thinking, 'What culture did you go to?' But this record is straight-ahead American.\"\nThe digital sounds of the 2000s also reportedly inspired Simon. \"I wondered, 'Is this an appropriate context to express various thoughts, given the way people listen now and the way music is exposed to the world?' Pop music, as it's constantly evolving, is completely different from the value system and aesthetic I grew up with and contributed to.\" Simon stated that he wasn't demonizing technological shifts. \"The Internet is opening things up\", he said. \"At first it caused the record business to implode, but now it's making life easier. It's broken the stranglehold that radio had. Downloading has made people more eclectic in their tastes, and I'd guess eventually that will redirect radio to loosen up, because it will have to compete. When that happens, you can say whatever you want, and there will be a place for it.\"\nEno was finally not credited as producer but as provider of \"sonic landscape\". Simon expressed gratitude with the album \u2013 \"Working with Brian Eno opens the door to a world of sonic possibilities; plus he's just a great guy to hang with in the studio, or for that matter in life.

Entertainment Weekly's Chris Willman stated that \"patience is rewarded with moments of stellar songwriting\", in an allusion to the high anticipation of the release of the album.

Of the song's theme, Wiseman said that he felt it was an example of \"write what you know\" despite criticism of songs which use similar Southern themes.The refrain of \"red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck\" heard in the opening of the song originated when Wiseman asked his co-writers about their weekend during a songwriting session and Davidson replied, \"Man, I was down in Georgia, hanging out with rednecks.\" Wiseman had been recording the conversation and decided to \"[chop] it up into short pieces\". He explained, \"I've been messing [around with] my cut and paste stuff, doing my hillbilly Skrillex thing. So I cut and pasted (the recording of 'rednecks') a couple of times.

So I remember I blurted out 'Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles/ Run Ol' Bocephus through a jukebox needle at a honky-tonk, where their boots stomp all night,' and then Craig goes, 'That's right,' kind of in celebration of getting the song started\".Shelton advocated for \"Boys 'Round Here\" to be released as the second single from Based on a True Story..., calling it, \"the best way to put into a song my personality\" and saying, \"That song had me from the first, 'cause I thought about all the guys I know back in Tishamingo [sic].

The group was unable to use the name Yes for legal reasons. However, the group did have Arista assign the catalog number of 90126 to the original releases of the CD and cassette.

Anderson notably built on several demos provided by Howe, some of which Howe released on his solo album Homebrew (1996) and subsequent releases.

The album was lyrically inspired by the memberships of Bono, the Edge, and Larry Mullen Jr. in a Christian group called the Shalom Fellowship, and consequently it contains spiritual and religious themes. Their involvement with Shalom Fellowship led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the \"rock and roll\" lifestyle, and threatened to break up the band.After completing the third leg of the Boy Tour in February 1981, U2 began to write new material for October, entering the recording studio in July 1981. Just as they did for their 1980 debut, Boy, the band recorded at Windmill Lane Studios with Lillywhite producing. The recording sessions were complicated by Bono's loss of a briefcase containing in-progress lyrics for the new songs, forcing a hurried, improvisational approach to completing the album on time.\nOctober was preceded by the lead single \"Fire\" in July 1981, while its second single, \"Gloria\", coincided with its release.

They wrote part of October during an extended sound check at First Avenue in Minneapolis. In March, on an otherwise successful American leg of the tour, the briefcase of lead vocalist Bono containing in-progress lyrics and musical ideas was lost backstage during a performance at a nightclub in Portland, Oregon. The band had limited time to write new music on tour and in July began a two-month recording session at Windmill Lane Studios largely unprepared, forcing Bono to quickly improvise lyrics. Steve Lillywhite, reprising his role as producer from U2's debut album, Boy, called the sessions \"completely chaotic and mad\".Bono said of the recording process of October, \"I remember the pressure it was made under, I remember writing lyrics on the microphone, and at \u00a350 an hour, that's quite a pressure. Lillywhite was pacing up and down the studio... he coped really well. And the ironic thing about October is that there's a sort of peace about the album, even though it was recorded under that pressure. A lot of people found October hard to accept at first, I mean, I used the word 'rejoice' precisely because I knew people have a mental block against it. It's a powerful word, it's lovely to say. It's implying more than 'get up and dance, baby.' I think October goes into areas that most rock 'n' roll bands ignore. When I listen to the album, something like 'Tomorrow,' it actually moves me.\" The briefcase was eventually recovered in October 2004, and Bono greeted its return as \"an act of grace\".

McCullough concluded, \"This October will last forever\". Adam Sweeting of Melody Maker also wrote a favorable review, saying: \"Their whole musical sensibility is shaped by a strong emotional bond to their homeland and its traditions. It gives them a completely different frame of reference from most groups, and on 'October' it's given them the strength to assimilate a barrage of disorientation and to turn that into a cohesive body of music.\"In contrast, NME published a negative review, in which reviewer Barney Hoskyns noted the \"excessive plaintiveness of Bono's voice and the forced power of U2's sound\". He concluded: \"Obviously rock doesn't expire just because groups run out of ways to change it... U2, I guess, will continue to 'move' in live performance, but they will only move on the lightest surface. Their music does 'soar'... But then 'God' knows, there are other religions\". Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone praised the Edge for his powerful guitar playing, \"drenched in echo and glory\", but said Bono's vocals were negatively impacted by him taking himself too seriously and that his lyrics were silly and clich\u00e9d. Pareles acknowledged the band's attempts to vary their sound, but said \"none of the strategies works as well yet as their basic power-trio dynamics\". In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the band \"tries too hard to move forward\" on October, with Bono straining to make big statements and the music sounding \"too pompous\".
