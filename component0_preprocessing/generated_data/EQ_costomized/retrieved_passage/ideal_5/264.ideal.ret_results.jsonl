Altogether, James Brown and the Famous Flames numerous R&B hit songs reached the Top 40 on the R&B and pop charts.They also appeared in the Hollywood films T.A.M.I. Show (1964) and Ski Party. Members of the Flames also contributed as songwriters and choreographers. In 2012 the Flames were retroactively inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside Brown.

Although members of the group did play instruments in some of their earliest shows and recordings, by 1959 Brown had hired a touring band and from that point on, the Flames contributed primarily as backing vocalists and dancers.

The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's criterion states that only artists whose first recording had been out for more than 25 years were eligible for induction. Brown's first solo recording did not meet that criterion. Rock & Roll Hall of Fame president and chief executive officer Terry Stewart contended that Brown was indeed eligible for induction but as a member of The Famous Flames. Concerning the Hall of Fame's failure to induct The Flames with Brown back in 1986, Stewart went on to say: \"There was no legislative intent why they weren't included; somehow they just got overlooked.\"In 2011, a special committee was set up to correct exclusions which might have occurred during the first two years of Rock Hall inductions (1986 and 1987) due to the impact of the bands' lead singers or front men. The Famous Flames (Byrd, Bennett, Terry and Stallworth) were inducted in April 2012 alongside other \"backing groups\" such as The Midnighters (Hank Ballard), The Comets (Bill Haley), The Crickets (Buddy Holly), The Blue Caps (Gene Vincent) and The Miracles (Smokey Robinson). Since all these lead singers were actually members of these groups, these were not really \"backing groups\" at all. This was highlighted by Smokey Robinson, who did the induction honors for all of the groups, including his own Miracles, who stated, \"These people do not stand behind you. They stand with you.\"  \"These are not backing groups. These are the groups.\" Bennett, as the Famous Flames' only surviving member, accepted the honor in person in Cleveland on April 14, 2012. Bennett further stated the induction was not only a correction for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame committee's mishap in 1986 but also a reunion: \"For years, I felt like we were all separated,\" said Bennett. \"I feel like we're whole again, I wish we could all be here as one group.

During the mid-1960s, the authorship of the song was not widely known. Cash asked Maybelle Carter during the recording session about the original author, Carter stated that the song was written by Ervin T. Rouse and his brother Gordon. Carter also told Cash that the songwriter resided in Florida. Cash called Florida disk jockey Jim Brooker, who told him that he lived with the Seminoles on the Everglades. In order to locate him, Brooker announced on air during his radio show, that if Rouse was listening to call the station to give him the phone number of Cash. Rouse called the station and contacted Cash who told him that he would be soon in Miami, Florida for a scheduled concert.During an intermission of the show in Miami, a man approached Cash backstage claiming to be Ervin Rouse. Cash recalled hearing the name but he could not remember who Rouse was. After clarifying that he had written a few songs, he remarked that one he co-wrote with his brother, named \"The Special\", was particularly successful. Cash recognized that he was talking about Orange Blossom Special. Cash believed the man, who actually was Rouse, that he had traveled from his house in the everglades in a custom-made swamp buggy to the house of his sister in Miami, where he borrowed her bicycle to ride ten miles to be at the concert. Cash invited the man to perform the song with him in the concert, receiving the acclaim of the audience.

Cavaliere was inspired to compose the song by his girlfriend Adrienne Buccheri, whom he only got to meet every Sunday amidst heavy touring and recording. Musically, the song differs from most of band's previous output, leaving the garage rock genre for Latin American influences, such as bai\u00e3o. Lyrically, \"Groovin'\" tells the tale of a narrator spending time with his partner on a Sunday afternoon. The song was arranged and recorded at the Talentmasters Studios, New York City in March of 1967.\nInitially, Atlantic Records were skeptical of releasing \"Groovin'\" as a single, given that it deviated from their previous output. After hearing it, the disc jockey Murray the K convinced Jerry Wexler to release it. \"Groovin'\" was released as a single on April 10, 1967 backed by \"Sue\u00f1o\".

Though their debut single \"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\" (1965), was of a similar vein, it was \"Good Lovin'\" that established what would be categorized as the Young Rascals musical style; a mix of garage rock and rhythm and blues that was personalized by Felix Cavaliere's blue-eyed soul vocals. The two singles following \"Good Lovin'\", \"You Better Run\" and \"Come On Up\" (both 1966) expanded upon this musical venture, the latter of which featured a \"more aggressive sound\" through Gene Cornish's fuzz guitar licks. Despite this, both singles were relative chart failures, reaching number 20 and 43 on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively.Starting with \"You Better Run\", the Young Rascals singer Eddie Brigati and Cavaliere formed a songwriting partnership, where Brigati provided most of the lyrics while Cavaliere composed the music. Additionally, by early 1967 the Young Rascals attempted to move away from their initial rhythm and blues sound, expanding on it. Their January 1967 single \"I've Been Lonely Too Long\" abandoned Cavaliere's organ in favor of a more piano-based sound; this moved the band back into the Billboard top 20. Despite this, the band found the charting to be a commercial failure, having aimed for the single to become a top-ten hit, leading to the members wanting to revamp the group's image. Around the same time, Cornish would state that their follow-up single would be completely different, lacking organ, guitars or drums; instead basing their sound on conga drums, harmonica and sound effect of birds.\"Groovin'\" was inspired by Cavaliere's then-girlfriend, Adrienne Buccheri, who according to him caused emotions that were \"tailor-made to that style of music\". In a later interview, Cavaliere stated that he believed Buccheri to be \"divinely sent for the purpose of inspiring my creativity\". The day of Sunday proved to be an additional general inspiration for Cavaliere in conceiving the song, as that was the sole day that he had a chance to spend time with Buccheri. Cavaliere states that \"Groovin'\" was a reflection of \"the bliss I felt relaxing with her on Sunday afternoons, watching the world go by\".The musical content of \"Groovin'\" was largely derived from the time Cavaliere spent working at mountain resorts in Upstate New York, where he was introduced to Latin rhythms, something that compelled him. The song was composed at an upright piano in the shared apartment of Brigati and Cavaliere, before the duo collaborated on the lyrics. Brigati was tasked with writing the lyrics of \"Groovin'\" by Cavaliere because \"he [Cavaliere] felt he [Brigati] was better at expressing Cavaliere's ideas\". The lyrical ideas were initially conveyed by Cavaliere humming a tune, to which Brigati would attempt to write lyrics to fit them, before Cavaliere would re-arrange the lyrics to his preferred liking.

The laid-back narrative is conveyed even though the narrator suggests to his partner that he'd like to walk through crowded avenues and meet strangers that are happy. However, the narrator laments the fact the Sunday afternoon will end, in dismay over the fact that it passed by so quickly. The phrase \"you and me endlessly\" which appears in the final verse was often misheard as the mondegreen \"you and me and Leslie\", which according to Caveliere was a result of his habit of slurring \"uneven words to squeeze them in to fit the beats\", something that was hampered by the fact that a conga fill appeared just as the word \"endlessly\" was sung.Musically, as performed by the Young Rascals, \"Groovin'\" is performed in F minor, and has a BPM of 108. The song sports a clear structure, with the chorus repeated three times, supported by three verses. Structurally, it is largely composed of the chords of D and E\u266d that are performed by Cavaliere on his piano during the choruses in a 6/8 time signature before alternating. During the verses, the chord of F\u266f largely substitutes the chord of D, though also marks the appearance of the chords of G and A through a modulation that appears towards the end of the verses. \"Groovin'\" bears a strong inspiration from Afro-Cuban music, particularly concerning its bai\u00e3o rhythm and instrumentation which was unconventional for the band. It features the use of conga drums played by drummer Dino Danelli and tambourine by Cornish rather than a more standard drum set.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52327", "text": "The recording session of \"Groovin'\" was held at the Talentmasters Studios on West 42nd Street in Manhattan, New York City on March 27, 1967. Though Atlantic Records had given the Young Rascals unlimited session time at their own Atlantic Studios, Cavaliere had requested that the session was held at Talentmasters, due to the fact that \"many great R&B groups were making their singles\" there; he additionally remembered the studio to have been a small box, something which \"didn't matter as James Brown had recorded there\". Besides the Young Rascals, present in the studio were Brigati's older brother David, the producer Arif Mardin and the engineer Chris Huston, who had been chosen to attend the session by David, who had known Huston while himself a member of Joey Dee and the Starliters in the early 1960s.The structure of \"Groovin'\" was according to Cavaliere \"mapped out\" together with Mardin right before right before they entered the studio, with the decision of cutting the drums from the song haven been taken during that moment. Additionally, Cavaliere had opted not to play his standard instrument, the hammond organ, on the recording. Instead, he opted to play the piano on the recording; the Carmen Cavallaro-inspired lounge piano performance during the song's instrumental break was orchestraded by Mardin in order to give the recording \"a little bit more texture\". Cavaliere states that Mardin helped with a lot of the arrangement and production of the song, even though the Young Rascals themselves were contractually credited as the producers.The basic track of \"Groovin'\" was recorded by Cavaliere on vocals and piano, with Cornish on tambourine and Danelli playing a conga drum and woodblock. Cavaliere recalls that Danelli held the woodblock sticks under his arms while playing the conga, before using it to hit a wood block taped to the conga drum, creating a \"ticking beat that sounded like a clock you ignored on a beautiful Sunday afternoon\". Following the basic track's completion, Cavaliere overdubbed vibes and Cornish guitar while the Brigati brothers added their backing vocals. Though Cornish tried to overdub the song's bass line, he was unable to get precisely what Cavaliere had envisioned, so instead they called in session musician Chuck Rainey to perform the bass duties on the song. With time running out in the studio, Huston used one of Talentmaster's janitors, a local musician named Michael Weinstein, to overdub the harmonica performance of the song. Cornish would return to the studio a few weeks later to overdub his harmonica performance; this would be used for the stereo mix of the song.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52328", "text": "After recording had been completed, Jerry Wexler, the head of Atlantic Records, was initially skeptical about releasing \"Groovin'\" as a single due to its vastly different musical style compared to the band's previous singles. The song was thus nearly shelved, had it not been for a chance meeting with disc jockey Murray the K. According to Cavaliere, Murray the K had been present during the recording session of \"Groovin'\". While listening to the playback of the song, he \"went nuts\" and stated that it was a \"certain smash\".Wexler persisted in insisting that the Young Rascals at least added a conventional drum part to the record, to which Cavaliere insisted that it was a homage to the \"whole world of Latin people out there who love to dance\". The final straw in releasing \"Groovin'\" came from Murray the K, who spoke to Wexler only a few days after it was recorded. Murray the K convinced Wexler by stating that he would play it on his radio show, ensuring it would become a number one hit.\"Groovin'\" was released in the US on April 10, 1967, backed by another song written by Cavaliere and Brigati, \"Sue\u00f1o\". On the Billboard Hot 100, the single entered on April 22 at number 79. It peaked at number one a month later on May 20, becoming the Young Rascals' second number one single and top-ten entry on the Billboard Hot 100. It initially spent two consecutive weeks at number one before being dislodged by Aretha Franklin's cover of \"Respect\" on June 2. \"Respect\" spent two weeks at number one before \"Groovin'\" once again reached number one on June 17, staying there for two weeks. \"Groovin'\" dropped off the Billboard Hot 100 chart completely from a position of 38 on July 17. At the time, \"Groovin'\" beat the Billboard milestone of dropping off the charts entirely the fastest after reaching number one. Elsewhere in North America, \"Groovin'\" also reached number three on the Billboard Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart, along with topping the Cash Box top 100 singles and R&B chart. In Canada, it reached number one on both the RPM Top 100 and R&B chart.In the UK, \"Groovin'\" was released on May 5, 1967. It entered the Record Retailer chart on May 31 at a position of 48, before peaking at number eight on July 4. It dropped off the charts on August 22 at a position of 48, having spent 13 weeks in total. \"Groovin'\" became the Young Rascals' only top-20 single in the UK. Elsewhere in the world, \"Groovin'\" became a top-twenty hit in Oceania, reaching number three in Australia and number 13 in New Zealand. In Africa, \"Groovin'\" reached the top-ten in both South Africa and Rhodesia, peaking at number ten and three respectively. Despite \"Groovin'\" finding massive commercial success on multiple continents, its commercial performance was lackluster in Continental Europe, where it failed to enter the top-ten on any national chart. It did reach the top-twenty in the Netherlands and West Germany, peaking at number 16 and 20 respectively.Due to the massive popularity of \"Groovin'\", the single was chosen to be the title track of the band's  third studio album, which was released by Atlantic Records on July 31, 1967. On mono copies of the album, the single version of \"Groovin'\" is included, while stereo copies include the alternate harmonica performance by Cornish. Fueled primarily by the success of \"Groovin'\", \"A Girl Like You\" and \"How Can I Be Sure\" (both 1967), Groovin' reached number five on the Billboard 200, becoming their highest charting studio album. \"Groovin'\" has also appeared on most of the Young Rascals' compilation albums, the first of which was Time Peace: The Rascals' Greatest Hits that was released by Atlantic a year after the single on June 24, 1968.

It is the band's first album with their classic line-up, adding new bassist Christian Olde Wolbers, who performed on close to half of the album's tracks, with guitarist Dino Cazares handling the rest. Many regard it as the band's best album and a heavy metal classic. The album was certified Gold in Australia by ARIA and Silver in the UK by the BPI.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_52375", "text": "Demanufacture is a concept album about a man's struggles against a machine-controlled government, with each song a chapter in his life. The band stated the album took its inspiration from the movie The Terminator.This album was originally mixed by its producer Colin Richardson, who had performed both duties on the band's debut album. However, differences between the band and producer emerged over the mix, with Richardson wishing not to stray too far from Soul of a New Machine. In the 2005 re-release liner notes, Monte Conner notes Richardson's focus on the guitars at the expense of the electronics, and suggests that this is the reason for the rejection of Richardson's mix. The final mix for the album was subsequently performed by Greg Reely, Rhys Fulber and the band. The Richardson mixes of \"Zero Signal\" and \"Body Hammer\" were later released on the Hatefiles compilation.\nThe album was recorded at Bearsville Studios in rural New York. Also in residence at the studio was Bon Jovi, recording their album These Days. Fear Factory were in the studio next door and one of Bon Jovi's engineers asked them to turn the sound down, as it was bleeding into Bon Jovi's drum mics, during Bon Jovi's recording sessions.After the release of the album, some critics and observers suggested that drummer Raymond Herrera had in fact used a drum machine, due to the often blistering speed and machine-like precision of the drumming, most notably on the kick drums. He records, however, with a click track to keep time. He is also known to use triggers on his drum sets for the purpose of keeping the sound of his drums consistent, particularly kick drums, regardless of how hard they are struck. This is a common strategy used by metal drummers when playing at such speeds, as relatively few drummers are able to achieve such rapid and consistent notes without the use of triggers.\nSamples, loops, and electronic textures were handled by Rhys Fulber throughout the album, with Reynor Diego contributing additional samples and keyboard parts. The music for \"A Therapy for Pain\" was originally written as the opening for \"Echoes of Innocence\" from the then-unreleased Concrete album. The outro passage was inspired by John Carpenter, Hijokaidan, and Aphex Twin. The use of organ in \"Dog Day Sunrise\" was inspired from an in-joke between Diego and Bell about The Doors. During post-production work with Richardson, Bell performed and added the organ parts to the track.\nThe opening riff of the title track was voted 19th in Total Guitar's list of \"The Heaviest Riffs of all Time\". The opening sample for \"Pisschrist\" and \"Zero Signal\" are both taken from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Concrete also had a track named \"Piss Christ\", but the two bear no similarities other than the title.\nThe original digipaks had slightly different artwork, most noticeably a different barcode on the front cover, and different colouring within the words \"Fear Factory\". The digipak was re-released in 2003 with all bonus tracks mentioned above, but with the new Roadrunner Records logo on the front and back and different lettering on the spine. This version is not limited, but has since been replaced by the remastered edition detailed below. In all, four different digipak versions of the album are available.\nTracks 1 to 4 were featured on 2006's The Best of Fear Factory.\nIn July 2013, the band toured Australia performing Demanufacture in its entirety.\nIn celebration of the 20 year anniversary of Demanufacture in 2015, Fear Factory embarked on a tour across Europe and North America playing the album.\"Your Mistake\" is from the album Victim in Pain.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52376", "text": "The music video for the song \"Replica\" is unlockable in the video game Test Drive 5.

The band's songwriter/guitarist Gary Kemp realised after the release of their second album that the nightclub audience they initially wanted to attract had lost interest in them in part because of the band's transition from dance music to pop. He no longer felt obligated to keep writing music for them and shifted his focus to soul and R&B influences such as Marvin Gaye and Al Green for this album. Kemp thought that bandmate Steve Norman's newfound interest in the saxophone would be well-suited to the sound he was going for, as would the decision to record most of the album at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas.\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to begin work on the album with producer Trevor Horn, the band tested out their working relationship with Tony Swain and Steve Jolley while recording its first single, \"Lifeline\", and chose to produce the album alongside them. \"Lifeline\" was a top ten hit on the UK Singles Chart, and its follow-up, \"Communication\", also did well. The album became available as the second single climbed the charts, and the overwhelming response to the title track dictated its release as the third single from the album, leading it to four weeks as the most popular song in the UK. It also became their first song to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, where it peaked at number four. A fourth single, \"Gold\", reached number two in the UK but only got as high as 29 in the US, which Kemp attributed to internal conflicts at their record label that took time away from promoting the band.\nOn the album charts, True reached number one in the UK and number 19 in the US while also having success in numerous other countries. It achieved platinum certification for sales of 300,000 units in the UK less than three months after its release. Most critics thought the album was enjoyable, but there were those who found something or much to dislike. The choice of suits for the album photos and \"True\" music video was thought to have misled US audiences by presenting them as too clean cut to have much else to offer other than soul ballads like the title song.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_52385", "text": "When Spandau Ballet first formed, their guitarist/songwriter Gary Kemp had been aware of how previous generations of Britain's youth culture had bands representing them, such as the Mods having The Who and Small Faces.:\u200a9:09\u200a He wanted people to associate Spandau with the fashion-wise clientele of a popular Tuesday night London gathering called the Blitz, and had written songs that sounded like what was played there, what he described as \"white European dance music\".Their first album, Journeys to Glory, was a successful culmination of this style of material that Kemp had written at his own pace and that had been tested in front of the Blitz crowd over an extended period of time, but coming up with songs for their second effort, Diamond, was more challenging. Although following a renewed interest in funk gave them a number 3 UK hit with its first single, \"Chant No. 1 (I Don't Need This Pressure On)\", the writer's block Kemp suffered as it climbed the UK Singles Chart resulted in his mimicking its use of horns and group vocals for the next single, \"Paint Me Down\", which had a number 30 showing in the UK, the lowest peak position there of any of their singles to date. An experiment with the eastern European sound from American film scores for the third single, \"She Loved Like Diamond\", fared even worse just as Diamond was about to be released; that inspired the idea to take another song from the album, \"Instinction\", and hire a new producer to remix it in the hope that it would perform better. Kemp described that track as being the closest thing to a pop song that Spandau Ballet had yet recorded. The band hired Buggles founder Trevor Horn to do the new arrangement of the song, which reached number ten in the UK and made Kemp realise that the clubgoers they had initially catered to were no longer interested in their music. He was now able to write songs without concern for their danceability or adherence to current tastes. In his autobiography I Know This Much: From Soho to Spandau, he explained, \"The freedom of not having to write just for Soho meant I could dive into that great big reservoir of pop, deep with melody and soul, and hopefully surface with the pearls I wanted.\"Because of the rebound the band experienced with Horn's reworking of \"Instinction\", the plan was to have him produce the next album. He was especially impressed with one of Kemp's recent compositions, \"Pleasure\", and wanted to start working with the band on it immediately. The rehearsal went well, and they began recording it at AIR Studios with the mindset that it would be the first single from the new album, which was initially called The Pleasure Project. On the first day of recording, however, Horn had drummer John Keeble redo the track repeatedly over the course of the ten-hour day to try to get it perfect and called Kemp that evening to offer to programme the drums and suggest that they get a new drummer. Kemp was stunned by the suggestion: \"I heard myself saying that programming the drums would not just be psychologically wrong for our team spirit, but it would also undermine John as a player.\" He refused Horn, who decided not to continue working with them. Later in 1982 Kemp told Smash Hits magazine, \"We couldn't have worked with Trevor because he was too overpowering, too dogmatic.\"The band's manager, Steve Dagger, suggested producers Tony Swain and Steve Jolley, who recently had success with Bananarama, and Kemp performed some of the songs he had just written for the duo with the plan of having them produce the first single from the new album to see if they had a good working relationship with the band. While Swain was leaning toward \"Communication\" as the best choice for their next hit song, Jolley insisted that they work on the \"up-tempo, more obvious pop sing-along\" \"Lifeline\". The band was credited alongside Jolley and Swain as producers of \"Lifeline\" and would be on the album as well.\n\"Lifeline\" was recorded at Red Bus Studios in Paddington as Spandau Ballet got a feel for their new producers, but they worked on the rest of the album at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas because of the soul music that had been recorded there and because Kemp felt that the tropical surroundings would help give the music the feeling he was trying to achieve.

Kemp recalled, \"We first started to devise a cover together for the True album when we were up in the mountains, in one of the pubs one evening. He was drawing in his sketchbook and a dove appeared, this little dove.\" Band later added alongside it the outline of a man's head with a brimmed hat, which the band loved; a variation was used for the sleeve of the \"True\" single. His work was described as \"a marker for the look of the time, a jazz-influenced style that could also be seen in an exaggerated fashion in the New Romantic look.\" Kemp credits him with having \"the skill of coming up with simple, figurative graphics that would set a visual tone for the decade.\" In 2012 he told The Herald:\nI felt David was tuning into something visually and graphically that was in the air anyway.

Perhaps there's life in the old clotheshorses yet.\" Trouser Press magazine's Ira Robbins also counted \"Communication\" and \"Lifeline\" as album highlights, adding, \"The remaining six cuts aren't as noteworthy, but at least aren't objectionable or off-putting.\" Dave Rimmer of Smash Hits conceded that \"there's nothing here as awful as, say, '[She Loved Like] Diamond', but on the other hand nothing as brilliant as 'Chant No. 1'. True is less interesting than previous Spandau LPs, but much more enjoyable.\" Record Mirror's Betty Page warned,Enter into True with a mind truly free of preconceptions, and you'll wallow in a chunk of creamy, dreamy funk with satisfyingly rounded edges. Turn a cynical eye to who you're dealing with and where they've come from and you'll find plenty of cannon fodder.\nGavin Martin of the New Musical Express wrote a long, scathing review of the album, which he opened by describing the band as \"slimy\" and \"ingratiating\" with \"opportunist, vaguely plagiaristic whims and indulgences\". He called the album \"milksop funk pap\", \"bland feckless goo\" and \"doleful emasculation\". Regarding Kemp's songwriting, he wrote,Despite all the talk of inner strength and celebrations of the highlife elsewhere, the music is stale and rigid with a backline that fairly grinds along where it should be bright and alert.\nAs a pop band Spandau are too pedestrian, too tied up in their own self-important world to provide a sharp/indignant/imaginative insight to the times; and as a \"soul\" band, well, they're fooling no one.\nRetrospective reviews were mixed. Paul Evans wrote a brief summary review of most of their album discography in The Rolling Stone Album Guide and gave True three stars out of five without much to recommend. At his most complimentary, he opined, \"Tony Hadley developed a way of vocalizing that joined the heavy dramatics of Bryan Ferry to the lounge act 'feeling' of a Gary Puckett or a bad Bobby Darin.\" Of all their albums, he concluded, \"True remains creepily fascinating.\" Dan LeRoy of AllMusic complimented \"the growing skill of guitarist Gary Kemp, the band's primary songwriter, who crafted a set of tunes aimed squarely at the charts.\" Like Rimmer, however, he did not find anything as interesting as their previous UK hits:Some listeners at the time called the album an MOR sellout, but its slick surfaces remain tough to resist, and while none of the cuts generate the excitement of past singles like \"To Cut a Long Story Short\" or \"Chant No. 1,\" True remains Spandau Ballet's most consistent and best all-around album.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The song \"Maniac\" was set to appear on the album with features vocals from Keri Hilson and Chris Brown however in November 2009 during an interview with E!

The highs here are not as high, and the lows are as low, unless you consider the very presence of Chad Kroeger and Daughtry, or the unveiling of Brandy\u2019s rapping alter ego Bran\u2019 Nu, to be more odious than a sub-Coldplay ballad. [...] That said, it is a mildly entertaining album\u2014as long as you block out most of the lyrics.\"David Balls of Digital Spy agreed saying that \"Timbaland dips into his usual bag of production tricks here and many of the supporting cast dutifully return, but never does this quite reach the same excitement levels as its predecessor. [...] it feels as though Tim's trying so hard to impress us with his pimped-up SUV that he's driven the thing off the road. The result? A disparate, disjointed collection of songs that feels like less than the sum of its parts.

[...] To be fair, Timbaland is not a terrible rapper. His clumsy flow is no worse than Diddy's jittery streams of twaddle, but it's just as annoying. The tendency here, whether intentional or not, is to surround himself with mediocre talent rather than the titans who he helped make superstars [...] The overall laziness of that facet is even more inexcusable coming from one of the most renowned producers of the last decade.\".The most positive review comes from USA Today, Steve Jones says \"He misses occasionally on this 17-track opus, but he's mainly on target with his jolts to the eardrums.\"However, August Brown of the Los Angeles Times was slightly less critical, stating that, \"many of the same vices that plagued the first installment of Shock Value keep the second edition sodden as well: Tim's precise, micromanaged beats usually outshine his random collection of vocal collaborators.\" Brown said that the album was not a complete disaster but \"for Timbaland fans pining for previous hits like Aaliyah's \"Are You That Somebody?\" or Furtado's \"Say It Right,\" Shock Value II is a weak cocktail.\"The editor from Entertainment Weekly said on the December 11 issue (page 115), \"So far, so predictable\u2014at least until \"Tomorrow In The Bottle,\" which features Chad Kroeger of Nickelback. That guy's got a funky bone? Talk about a shocker.

There are even fewer who can crossover from hardcore hip-hop heads to become a mainstream household name. [...] it's not a pure \"Timbaland Presents\" situation like it has been in the past, where one felt Timbaland was simply showcasing artists he felt deserved the shine over his own high quality sound.

She collaborated on A New Day Has Come with various producers, including Anders Bagge and Peer \u00c5str\u00f6m for the first time.\nA New Day Has Come garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics, who noticed that Dion explores a \"broader, more adventurous\" range of pop music and \"dips its toe\" into modern music, particularly dance-pop (\"Sorry for Love\"). However, the album also contains the usual adult contemporary songs, including power ballads like \"I Surrender\", \"Have You Ever Been in Love\", and the title track. Critics also praised \"Ten Days\", \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\", \"I'm Alive\", \"When the Wrong One Loves You Right\", \"The Greatest Reward\", and the album's two covers: \"Nature Boy\" and \"At Last\".\nA New Day Has Come became a commercial success throughout the world and entered number one in more than seventeen countries.

Overall, A New Day Has Come has sold 12 million copies worldwide.\nThe first single, \"A New Day Has Come\", was released in March 2002 and peaked inside the top ten in Canada and Europe.

Since then, she had performed publicly only a handful of times, including 21 September 2001, when she sang a live rendition of \"God Bless America\" at the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon honoring victims of the September 11 attacks, and 28 September for Montreal's companion fund-raiser, A Show for Life, singing \"L'amour existe encore\".According to Dion, the album's title, A New Day Has Come, acknowledged a new chapter in her life and career. However, she was also deeply affected by the events of 11 September and wanted the words to serve as a reminder of the tragedy. \"It represents my child, because I gave life,\" Dion said. \"Obviously, it also marks my return with a new album.

In the lead-up to the release of Innerspeaker, four small video snippets were released through their YouTube channel, showing them practicing the songs, \"The Bold Arrow of Time\", \"Island Walking\" and another instrumental piece. The album contains two re-recorded songs, \"Desire Be Desire Go\" (previously released on their self-titled EP) and \"The Bold Arrow of Time\" (previously recorded, but unreleased).\nPast Tame Impala releases were done by Kevin Parker purely for his own enjoyment. Innerspeaker marks the first time Parker has \"recorded something for an intended release. In the past [he has] just recorded a song, then done another two weeks later and eventually put them together.\" While Tame Impala tour as a band, it is Parker's personal music project in which he writes and records all the music to. Commenting on this, Parker said \"Tame Impala is just one sliver of the giant amount of noise-making that we do as a circle of friends. I don't feel bad doing the recording by myself because I don't expect that input in their bands...to us Tame Impala is just Kevin Parker's project and everyone has a project\" and \"Tame Impala has always been a solo project. It has two halves: one half is the recording side which is very calculated and pieced together, and the other side is the live side, where we take what's been recorded and turn them into live songs.\" Parker has been recording music solo for a long time, as he explains \"I\u2019ve always recorded music. When I was 12, I used to set up two tape machines and multi-track myself. First, I\u2019d record a beat on the drums, then, I\u2019d play that tape into another tape recorder while playing keyboard; then I\u2019d take that tape and play bass guitar along with the drums and keyboard. I\u2019d keep adding instruments. I did that for a long time until my dad bought me an 8-track, and then I continued recording music by myself, even if I was in other bands at the same time.\" Parker's father \"played a lot of music as a hobby\" and was a \"big influence\" on Kevin.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52506", "text": "The album was recorded almost entirely at Wave House, Injidup, a beach shack about four hours south of Perth with 180 degree views of the Indian Ocean, with \"no internet, no phone reception and no TVs\". While it had been reported that Tame Impala were recording in a mansion, Parker ran into problems: \"The mansion isn't really like a mansion to us, it's more like a big, wooden house; the roof was leaking and the power was so bad that it kept turning off and I kept losing drum tracks. I lost a whole day's worth of drum tracks one day while recording Innerspeaker. Sometimes the power would go off for a second, which was enough to kill off my eight-track, and I lost everything. We also had plastic on top of everything because the roof was leaking so bad\". Still, he maintained that \"it's the most amazing scenery [he has] ever woken up to\" and that recording in the house was a luxury, with the scenery having a subconscious influence on the recording.Recording started in June 2009 and finished in August 2009. Parts of the album were recorded all over the house, with some being recorded on the balcony overlooking the ocean whilst the Fremantle Doctor blew towards the house. Additional recording took place at Poon's Head Studio and at Parker's House. Regarding the recording environment, Parker said, \"the idea of going to some flash studio where there's some stranger telling you how to arrange your song is pretty absurd to us\". Consequently, the majority of the album was recorded and produced by Parker, with Jay Watson and Dominic Simper contributing small parts to the recording.Mixing began in November 2009 and was undertaken by acclaimed Flaming Lips producer Dave Fridmann at Tarbox Road Studios in Cassadaga, New York. Originally, Parker had intended to make the entire album by himself, recording, mixing and producing it all by himself, but he ran into problems when he was \"mixing it and couldn't get the sounds [he] wanted to.\" Parker wanted it to sound \"absolutely explosive\" but was not able to do so on his own. At first, he was hesitant to let Fridmann mix it and was \"torn about instantly handing over everything\". However, he later concluded that \"in the end, there's no way in hell [he] could've made the album sound as good as Dave [Fridmann] made it sound\" and that his experiences working with Fridmann made him \"feel like [he had] taken a giant leap forward as an engineer\". Speaking about the album's and Fridmann's slightly lo-fi sound, Parker said \"it has a different emotion to it, it brings out a different feeling\".Tim Holmes from the band Death in Vegas also came along during the recording of Innerspeaker to handle engineering duties, but was not required very often. As Parker recalls, \"I told him that the Tame Impala set-up was pretty unprofessional and that there wouldn't be much for him to do. Tim was totally cool with it. He said he'd bring his fishing rod and help out when needed.\" Parker later said, \"He encouraged me to use some different mics instead of some old mics I was using, which helped a lot.

In 2012, Tame Impala recorded a cover of \"That's All for Everyone\" to be included on the Fleetwood Mac tribute album Just Tell Me That You Want Me, which was originally intended to be released on Innerspeaker. \"When we made our first album our first idea is that it would be a double album and that it would finish with a cover of \"That's All for Everyone\". The joke being that we'd choose a song from Fleetwood Mac's double and use it to close out our double album, which was also our debut album.

So it was great when we got the offer to be included on that compilation because it meant we finally had a reason to record that song.\"The title Innerspeaker was selected by Parker, which was a term he came up with to try to explain the \"feeling you get when you're at your most inspired, the idea that [a song] just appears to you vividly and if someone plugged a stereo into your brain they'd be able to hear it\" and also said \"the songs come from somewhere internal, rather than slowly taking shape with a bunch of guys jamming in a room. One way of writing a song is that you've got an idea in your head and build a song around that. Another is more of a collaborative thing: It starts out as nothing and gets put together with whatever happens.

Gladiators also cooperated with the toaster U-Roy.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_52513", "text": "Albert Griffiths, singer and guitar player, was the founder of the reggae group The Gladiators. After some success with the singles \"You Are The Girl\" (a b-side to The Ethiopians' hit record \"Train to Skaville\") in 1966, he recruited his childhood friends David Webber and Errol Grandison in 1968 to form the original Gladiators vocal group. The group's name was allegedly suggested by a fellow bus passenger during the time of their first recordings.The group's first major success was with the single \"Hello Carol\" in 1968, for producer Coxsone Dodd, which topped the Jamaican music charts.  Shortly afterwards, in 1969, Webber was stricken with illness and was replaced by Clinton Fearon, one of Griffiths' proteges.  Similarly Grandison left the group in 1973 for family commitments and was replaced by Gallimore Sutherland.During the early 1970s the Gladiators cut numerous records for various producers such as, Lloyd Daley and Lee Perry, but it was their recordings for Dodd at Studio One that became the biggest hits.  During this time at Studio One the Gladiators' hits included \"Bongo Red\", \"Jah Jah Go Before Us\", \"Mr. Baldwin\", and \"Roots Natty\".The success of these recordings garnered the attention of Britain-based Virgin Records, who gave the group their first major recording contract in 1976.  Their debut album released on Virgin was the Tony Robinson produced Trenchtown Mix Up (1976), which included revisions of many of their early hits.  They followed this effort with Proverbial Reggae (1978). At the time Gladiators was a band with Albert Griffiths on lead guitar and vocals, Clinton Fearon on bass guitar and vocals, Gallimore Sutherland on rhythm guitar and vocals, Sly Dunbar on drums, Lloyd Parks on bass, Uziah \"Sticky\" Thompson on percussion, Ansel Collins on keyboards and Earl 'Wire' Lindo on synthesizer. Errol Thompson and Joe Gibbs were their engineer and mixer, and Robinson the record producer.\nDodd and Studio One also released Studio One Presenting the Gladiators, (1978) a compilation of some early Gladiators' records released 1968 \u2013 1974. The Gladiators' next two albums on Virgin were Naturality (1978) and Sweet So Till (1979). The group's next album Gladiators was recorded at Coach House Studios in the UK with local producer Eddy Grant.  It was the first Gladiators' album on which no member of the group played any of the instruments, as a few members of the band Aswad were brought in.  The album did worse than their previous work, and they were subsequently dropped from their contract with Virgin.  Virgin subsequently released two compilation albums Vital Selection in 1981 and Dreadlocks The Time Is Now in 1983.At the time, roots reggae was declining. A new type of reggae \u2013 based on drum machine, sampler, synthesizers and organ \u2013 occurred in the 1980s; ragga. One of the reasons for ragga's swift propagation is that it is generally easier, and less expensive to produce, than reggae performed on traditional musical instruments. Nevertheless, the Gladiators released eleven studio albums in the 1980s. They soon found a home at US-based Nighthawk Records and released Symbol of Reality in late 1982 followed by Serious Thing in 1984.  One year later the Gladiators changed labels again, this time moving to Heartbeat Records, where they released albums throughout the latter half of the decade.  In 1987 Fearon left the group after eighteen years, but Griffiths and Sutherland have continued to release albums on various labels since then.\nWith the advent of dancehall in the 1990s, the Gladiators only released three studio albums during that decade. Eventually, the Gladiators, Mighty Diamonds, Bunny Wailer, Heptones and Burning Spear had a renaissance. The dancehall artists had to change their profile and baptised their new showmanship as conscious dancehall.In 2005, the Gladiators released Fathers and Sons which has been regarded as Albert Griffiths' farewell after ill health forced him to retire from touring, with his sons, Alan and Anthony, joining the group.In June 2013, the group announced that their next album would be a collaboration with deejay Droop Lion, nephew of original Gladiators' member David Webber, performing new versions of some of the group's most popular tracks.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It just got to the point where we didn't enjoy what we were doing anymore.

Half of it is about my ex-fianc\u00e9 who meant everything to me, so once Motograter had fell apart and then her and I dwindled apart it just took a huge part of my life.

I'm not one of those artists that just likes to get up on stage and drink beer, when I sing a song I like to take myself and the fans back to the place where I was when I wrote that song.\"\nWhen Moody spoke about the first time he heard \"The Bleeding\", he said: \"When I first heard it, I sat back in my chair and almost cried. I mean, it came so naturally. Cause at the time, you know, I had just separated from my ex-fiancee and with Motograter separating, it was a real tragic time. A good friend of mine had just passed.

Digby Diehl of the Times referred to the band's sound as \"a hypnotic m\u00e9lange\" and further wrote that: \"The flute and harpsichord jazz improvisations on numbers such as 'Stephanie Knows Who' and 'Orange Skies' lend a fresh lift to what might be an ordinary rock piece.\" A later review from the paper placed the band's \"clean\" presentation and \"balance of instruments and roles\" with those of the Beatles and Buffalo Springfield. Echols remembered the band's performances with the expanded lineup as \"probably the most fun we had playing.\"Da Capo was first announced as an album on November 12, 1966, with an advertisement placed by Elektra on page 1 of Billboard magazine. By late January 1967 when Da Capo was listed by Billboard as a \"New Action Album\", \"7 and 7 Is\" had already received commercial and critical success, helping to boost the album's sales. It entered the Billboard Top LPs chart on February 11, 1967, and peaked at number 80 on April 8, failing to achieve the commercial success the band had hoped it would. Lee blamed the album's disappointing performance on Elektra, but Botnick disagreed, saying, \"Arthur wouldn't go out and promote it!\" Stuart later reflected that the band \"should have toured behind it\"; however, he recognized that Lee \"prided himself on being different. If bands toured after releasing an album, he would do it differently.\" Regarding the album as \"an undeniably groundbreaking release for 1966\" with a style that had \"no other context or reference in [rock] up to that point\", Einarson asks if Lee had \"overestimated his own audience with a body of music perhaps too complex and esoteric for their tastes\". In the observation of writer Jim Bickhart, \"by that point, Arthur had shown he was kind of oblivious to who his audience was and how to appeal to them ... he was not thinking, 'I'm going to bring my audience along with me,' he was just thinking, 'I'm going to do what I'm going to do.'\"Da Capo received favorable recognition from contemporary reviewers. David Harris of Mojo-Navigator called it \"a great advance\" over Love's debut album and recognized their \"integration of jazz and [rock] into a new form of music.\" In a more critical review for Esquire magazine, Robert Christgau felt that, although \"7 and 7 Is\" was a \"perfect rocker\", the rest of side one \"sounds cluttered and lacks sock\", directing the latter criticism to Lee's voice being \"more often too sweet for his material.\" Of \"Revelation\", Christgau wrote: \"It includes excellent guitar and harmonica work and great screaming ... It also includes some mediocre alto sax and (I shudder) a protracted drum solo.

Mike Segretto called the album \"frustrating\" due to it not \"follow[ing] through on its tremendous promise.\" He said that the first side \"may be the best run of Love songs the band ever recorded\", and that the album may have ended up being their best if the second side \"had some songs on it.\" Despite this, Segretto said that the strength of side one still set the album \"well above the majority of its contemporaries.\"The album has been featured in several record guides, such as: John Tobler's 100 Great Albums of the Sixties (1994); Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000), where it was voted number 331; Tom Moon's 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die (2008), albeit as a \"Catalog Choice\" after Forever Changes; and Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2018).

{"id": "264_75", "question": "What music label is Revolver represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_52572", "text": "Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied by the double A-side single \"Eleanor Rigby\" / \"Yellow Submarine\". The album was the Beatles' final recording project before their retirement as live performers and marked the group's most overt use of studio technology to date, building on the advances of their late 1965 release Rubber Soul. It has since become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in the history of popular music, with recognition centred on its range of musical styles, diverse sounds and lyrical content.\nThe Beatles recorded Revolver after taking a three-month break at the start of 1966, and during a period when London was feted as the era's cultural capital. Regarded by some commentators as the start of the group's psychedelic period, the songs reflect their interest in the drug LSD, Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde while addressing themes such as death and transcendence of material concerns. With no plans to reproduce their new material in concert, the band made liberal use of automatic double tracking, varispeed, reversed tapes, close audio miking, and instruments outside of their standard live set-up. Among its tracks are \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", incorporating heavy Indian drone and a collage of tape loops; \"Eleanor Rigby\", a song about loneliness featuring a string octet as its only musical backing; and \"Love You To\", a foray into Hindustani classical music. The sessions also produced a non-album single, \"Paperback Writer\", backed with \"Rain\".\nIn the United Kingdom, the album's 14 tracks were gradually distributed to radio stations in the weeks before its release. In North America, Revolver was reduced to 11 songs by Capitol Records, with the omitted three appearing on the June 1966 LP Yesterday and Today. The release there coincided with the Beatles' final concert tour and the controversy surrounding John Lennon's remark that the band had become \"more popular than Jesus\". The album topped the Record Retailer chart in the UK for seven weeks and the US Billboard Top LPs list for six weeks. Critical reaction was highly favourable in the UK but less so in the US amid the press's unease at the band's outspokenness on contemporary issues.\nRevolver expanded the boundaries of pop music, revolutionised standard practices in studio recording, advanced principles espoused by the 1960s counterculture, and inspired the development of psychedelic rock, electronica, progressive rock and world music. The album cover, designed by Klaus Voormann, combined Aubrey Beardsley-inspired line drawing with photo collage and won the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts. Aided by the 1987 international CD release, which standardised its content to the original Parlophone version, Revolver has surpassed Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) in many critics' estimation as the Beatles' best album. It was ranked first in the 1998 and 2000 editions of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums and third in the 2003 and 2012 editions of Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".

The group's manager, Brian Epstein, had intended that 1966 would then follow the pattern of the previous two years, in terms of the band making a feature film and an accompanying album, followed by concert tours during the summer months. After the Beatles vetoed the proposed film project, the time allocated for filming became a further three months free of professional engagements. This was the longest period the band members had experienced outside the group collective since 1962, and it defied the convention that pop acts should be working almost continually. The group thereby had an unprecedented amount of time to prepare for a new album.\n\nBeatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner cites 1966 as the start of the band's \"psychedelic period\", as do musicologists Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc. Schaffner adds: \"That adjective [psychedelic] implies not only the influence of certain mind-altering chemicals, but also the freewheeling spectrum of wide-ranging colors that their new music seemed to evoke.\" Music journalist Carol Clerk describes Revolver as having been \"decisively informed by acid\", following John Lennon and George Harrison's continued use of the drug LSD since the spring of 1965. Through these experiences, the two musicians developed a fascination for Eastern philosophical concepts, particularly regarding the illusory nature of human existence. Despite his bandmates' urging, after Ringo Starr had also partaken of the drug, Paul McCartney refused to try LSD. Intent on self-improvement, McCartney drew inspiration from the intellectual stimulation he experienced among London's arts scene, particularly its thriving avant-garde community. With Barry Miles as his guide, he became immersed in the nascent British counterculture movement, which soon emerged as the underground.While arranging dates for the band's world tour, Epstein agreed to a proposal by journalist Maureen Cleave for the Beatles to be interviewed separately for a series of articles that would explore each of the band members' personality and lifestyle beyond his identity as a Beatle. The articles were published in weekly instalments in London's Evening Standard newspaper throughout March 1966, and reflected the transformation that was underway during the group's months of inactivity. Of the two principal songwriters, Cleave found Lennon to be intuitive, lazy and dissatisfied with fame and his surroundings in the Surrey countryside, while McCartney conveyed confidence and a hunger for knowledge and new creative possibilities. In his book Revolver: How the Beatles Reimagined Rock 'n' Roll, Robert Rodriguez writes that, whereas Lennon had been the Beatles' dominant creative force before Revolver, McCartney now attained an approximately equal position with him. In a further development, Harrison's interest in the music and culture of India, and his study of the Indian sitar, had inspired him as a composer. According to author Ian Inglis, Revolver is widely viewed as \"the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52574", "text": "The Beatles had hoped to work in a more modern facility than EMI's London studios at Abbey Road and were impressed with the sound on records created at Stax Studio in Memphis. In March 1966, Epstein investigated the possibility of their recording the new album at Stax, where, according to a letter written by Harrison two months later, the group intended to work with producer Jim Stewart. The idea was abandoned after locals began descending on the Stax building, as were alternative plans to use either Atlantic Studios in New York or Motown's Hitsville USA facility in Detroit.Recording for the album instead began at EMI Studio 3 in London on 6 April, with George Martin again serving as producer. The first track attempted was Lennon's \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", the arrangement for which changed considerably between the initial take that day and the subsequent remake. This first version of \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", along with several other outtakes from the album sessions, was included on the 1996 compilation Anthology 2. Also recorded during the Revolver sessions were \"Paperback Writer\" and \"Rain\", which were issued as the A- and B-side of a non-album single in late May.\nThe band had worked on ten songs, including both sides of the upcoming single, by 1 May, when they interrupted the sessions to perform at the NME's annual Poll-Winners Concert. At a time when Time magazine dubbed London \"the Swinging City\", belatedly recognising its ascendance as the era's cultural capital, the Beatles drew inspiration from attending concerts by visiting artists, as well as film premieres, plays and other cultural events. From February through June, these musical acts included Stevie Wonder, Roy Orbison, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Mamas & the Papas, Bob Dylan (with whom they socialised extensively), Luciano Berio and Ravi Shankar. During mid-May, Lennon and McCartney attended a private listening party for the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds album, and McCartney met Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni, who filmed Blowup in London, inspired by the contemporary fashion scene.On 16 May, Epstein responded to a request from Capitol Records, EMI's North American counterpart, to supply three new songs for an upcoming US release, titled Yesterday and Today. Issued on 20 June, this album combined tracks that Capitol had omitted from the Beatles' previous US releases with songs that the band had originally issued on non-album singles. From the six completed recordings for Revolver, Martin selected three Lennon-written songs, since the sessions had favoured his compositions thus far. Keen to limit the interruption to recording that multiple television appearances would create, the Beatles spent two days making promotional films for the \"Paperback Writer\" single. The first set of clips was filmed at EMI Studio 1 on 19 May by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, director of the popular TV show Ready Steady Go! The following day, the group shot further clips for the two songs in the grounds of Chiswick House, in west London. In the face of fans' complaints of an aloofness in their new work, however, the band conceded to making a live appearance on Top of the Pops on 16 June.The camaraderie among the four Beatles was at its highest throughout this period. A disagreement between McCartney and his bandmates nevertheless resulted in McCartney walking out of the studio during the final session, for Lennon's \"She Said She Said\", on 21 June, two days before the band were due to fly to West Germany for the first leg of their world tour. The Beatles spent over 220 hours recording Revolver \u2013 a figure that excludes mixing sessions, and compares with less than 80 hours for Rubber Soul. Final mixing of the album took place on 22 June. The Beatles celebrated the project's completion by attending the opening of Sibylla's, a nightclub in which Harrison had a financial stake.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52575", "text": "In mid-May 1966, Tony Hall of Record Mirror wrote a preview of the Beatles' new recordings in which he opined that some of them were \"the most revolutionary ever made by a pop group\". While avoiding mention of the official song titles, he highlighted Lennon's \"The Void\" for its electronic effects, along with a \"McCartney song about lonely people\" set to string orchestration, and a \"Harrison number on which he plays a long exotic solo on sitar\". In Britain, EMI gradually distributed the album's songs to radio stations throughout July \u2013 a strategy that MacDonald describes as \"building anticipation for what would clearly be a radical new phase in the group's recording career\". Revolver was released there on 5 August and on 8 August in the United States. \"Eleanor Rigby\" was issued as a double A-side single with \"Yellow Submarine\". The pairing of a ballad devoid of any instrumentation played by a Beatle and a novelty song marked a significant departure from the usual content of the band's singles.Schaffner likens the Beatles' 1966 recordings to the moment of transformation in the film The Wizard of Oz, \"where, when Dorothy discovers herself transported from Kansas to Oz, the film dramatically changes from black-and-white to glorious technicolor\". The album appeared a year before psychedelic drugs became a phenomenon in youth culture, and it was the source of confusion for the group's more conservative fans. A female writer later complained in Beatles Monthly that 1966 represented the end of \"The Beatles we used to know before they went stark, raving mad\". In this way, Revolver marked the start of a change in the Beatles' core audience, as their young, female-dominated fanbase gave way to a following that increasingly comprised more serious-minded, male listeners.The release coincided with a period of public relations challenges for the band, the combination of which led to their decision to retire from touring following the end of their North American tour, on 29 August. In the US, the album's release was a secondary event to the controversy surrounding the recent publication there of Cleave's interview with Lennon, in which he remarked that the Beatles had become \"more popular than Jesus\". This episode followed the unfavourable reaction to the Yesterday and Today butcher sleeve, from the press, radio stations and retail outlets. As a result, at press conferences during the tour, questions were typically focused on religious matters rather than the band's new music. In addition, the group were vocal in their opposition to the Vietnam War, a stand that further redefined their public image in the US. The Beatles did not attempt to perform any of the songs from Revolver during the tour.Reporting on \"Swinging London\" for The Village Voice, Richard Goldstein said that, as if in response to the antagonism being shown towards the band in the US, \"British youth has flipped completely over the new Beatle album, Revolver.\" Author Howard Sounes writes that, amid the fine weather of the 1966 summer and England's recent win in the World Cup, Revolver was the nation's \"soundtrack album of the season\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52576", "text": "In the UK, where \"Eleanor Rigby\" was the favoured side, the single became the best-selling song of 1966, after topping the national chart for four weeks during August and September. On Record Retailer's LPs chart (later the UK Albums Chart), Revolver entered at number 1 and stayed there for seven weeks during its 34-week run in the top 40. On the national chart compiled by Melody Maker, the album was number 1 for nine weeks. By October, at least ten of the LP's songs had been covered by other artists and reviewed by Melody Maker. Among these, Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers' version of \"Got to Get You into My Life\", which McCartney co-produced, was a top ten hit. McCartney's ballads \"Here, There and Everywhere\" and \"For No One\" became highly popular among mainstream recording artists. In the UK, Revolver was the second highest-selling album of 1966, behind The Sound of Music. In the NME readers' poll for 1966, Revolver and Pet Sounds were jointly recognised as the magazine's \"Album of the Year\".\nIn America, Capitol were wary of the religious references in \"Eleanor Rigby\", given the ongoing controversy, and instead pushed \"Yellow Submarine\". The latter peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it, in Gould's description, \"the first 'designated' Beatles single since 1963\" not to top that chart. On the Billboard Top LPs chart, Revolver hit number 1 on 10 September, a week after the end of Yesterday and Today's five-week run at the top. The Beatles were presented with gold discs from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), recognising the album as a \"million seller\", during their 24 August press conference at the Capitol Tower in Hollywood. Revolver was number 1 there for six weeks and remained on the chart until mid February 1968. In March 1967, Revolver was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Voormann's cover design won the Grammy for Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts.Based on retail sales up to early October 1966, Revolver was the eighth-highest-selling album of the year in the US. Although commercially successful, it ranked only equal tenth (with Help!) on the list of the Beatles' biggest-selling albums in the US, as supplied by Allen Klein in 1970. According to figures published in 2009 by former Capitol executive David Kronemyer, further to estimates he gave in MuseWire magazine, the album had sold 1,187,869 copies in the US by 31 December 1966 and 1,725,276 copies by the end of the decade.The April 1987 CD release of Revolver standardised the track listing to the original UK version. Revolver returned to the UK Albums Chart the following month, peaking at number 55, while the 2009 remastered album reached number 9. In 2013, after the British Phonographic Industry altered its sales award protocol, the album was certified Platinum based on UK sales since 1994. In January 2014, the Capitol version of Revolver was issued on CD for the first time, both as part of the Beatles' U.S. Albums box set and as an individual release.

The song was written by Shaffer \"Ne-Yo\" Smith, Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel S. Eriksen, Espen Lind, Amund Bj\u00f8rklund, Beyonc\u00e9 and produced by Stargate and Beyonc\u00e9. \"Irreplaceable\" was originally a country record; it was re-arranged as a mid-tempo ballad with pop and R&B influences by modifying the vocal arrangements and instrumentation. During the production and recording sessions, Beyonc\u00e9 and Ne-Yo wanted to create a record which people of either gender could relate to. The song's lyrics are about the breakdown of a relationship with an unfaithful man and the song contains a message about female empowerment.\nFollowing the moderate chart performances of \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" and \"Ring the Alarm\", \"Irreplaceable\" was released internationally on October 23, 2006, as the album's second single, and the third in the United States on December 5, 2006. The single was released through Columbia Records. Pitchfork Media and Rolling Stone placed it on their lists of Best Songs of the 2000s. \"Irreplaceable\" won several awards, including Best R&B/Soul Single at the 2007 Soul Train Music Awards. It was nominated for the Record of the Year award at the 50th Grammy Awards.\nThe single became Beyonc\u00e9's fourth number-one in the U.S., was B'Day's most successful release, and remained at the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for 10 consecutive weeks. \"Irreplaceable\" was the twenty-fifth most successful song of the 2000s (decade) in the U.S., and was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It became Beyonc\u00e9's second single to achieve 200 million audience impressions in 2006. She is the second singer to achieve this feat in the U.S., the first having been Mariah Carey in 2005. \"Irreplaceable\" also peaked at number one in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, and New Zealand, at number four in the United Kingdom, and reached the top ten in several other European countries. \"Irreplaceable\" was the most successful song of 2007 in the US and 2007's tenth best-selling digital single with over 4.6 million copies sold worldwide. It also was the most downloaded female ringtone of the 2000s decade in the US.\nThe single's accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler and served as the debut performance of Beyonc\u00e9's all-female band, Suga Mama. The video was included on the 2007 B'Day Anthology Video Album, and a video edit was produced for \"Irreemplazable\", the Spanish version of the song. It won the Video of the Year award at the 2007 Black Entertainment Television (BET) Awards, and was nominated for the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year at the 2007 Awards. \"Irreplaceable\" has regularly featured in Beyonc\u00e9's tours and live performances since 2006.

Production team Stargate and singer-songwriter Ne-Yo had written for Beyonc\u00e9's second album B'Day, but Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate said that they might not have gone in the direction they did on the song. The tune did not suit Beyonc\u00e9's voice, and Ne-Yo wrote the lyrics from a male perspective, although it was not based upon his personal experiences. Ne-Yo wrote the song in the country style, thinking of country singers Shania Twain and Faith Hill during the sessions. When Ne-Yo heard them playing the song with a guitar, he thought it sounded like country music. But when the drums were incorporated into the music, it was brought to an R&B vibe, and Ne-Yo considered making an R&B-country western music song instead.When the team worked with Ne-Yo, they recorded the song with a male vocalist. However, they thought a female vocalist would be more suitable, and Ne-Yo also thought that it was empowering for a woman to sing it. Eriksen of Stargate said it was an A&R person who suggested that the song would work better when sung by a woman. Two labels wanted the song. While Beyonc\u00e9 worked on material for B'Day, she was pleased with the demo of the \"Irreplaceable\" that was presented to her. However, \"Irreplaceable\" did not seem to fit on B'Day, which was supposed to be \"a hard-hitting club album\". Swizz Beatz, who was working on the album, declared that Beyonc\u00e9 would be crazy not to include the song on the record. Beyonc\u00e9 asked for changes to the song, including the addition of drums, vocal arrangements, and singing in a higher register than the demo. Espen Lind and Amund Bj\u00f8rklund, from the Norwegian production team Espionage, wrote the chord structure and the guitar part. In an interview with MTV, Ne-Yo said, \"Beyonc\u00e9 had some stuff that she wanted to get off her chest\", while aiming to make a record that women could relate to, in keeping with the theme of the album.\nThe recording was engineered by Jim Caruana and mixed by Jason Goldstein at Sony Music Studios in New York City. Goldstein was hired to mix B'Day. He said: \"This song was really simple to mix. It was produced by Stargate and the sounds are really good and they all made sense, and there was lots of room for all the instruments.\" Goldstein used a board equalizer for the drums' treatment. For the acoustic guitars, he used the analogue flanger of a TC 1210 spatial expander \"to sweeten the sound\" and to give them \"a little bit more spread\". Goldstein thought \"Irreplaceable\" sounded \"a bit old-school\"; an eighth note delay echo was placed on the song's lead vocal at 341ms, using the Echo Farm plug-in software. For the backing vocals, Goldstein used Echo Farm with a quarter note delay at 682ms and Sony's Oxford Dynamics compressor/limiter in dual-mono mode.The compressor was placed in Classic setting, to emulate the LA-2A leveling amplifier, and the Warmth button used to add harmonics. Oxford Dynamics was used for the bass in a different setting. Goldstein passed the final mix through the Oxford EQ and Inflator plug-ins. Pro Tools software was used to print the aux track into a 44.1kHz/24-bit CD and then into a 24-bit CD master. After the sessions for \"Irreplaceable\" ended, Hermansen said that \"everyone felt they had captured something special and that Beyonc\u00e9 had done the track justice\", but there were still concerns that urban radio might not play the song as it featured acoustic guitars and had more of a pop appeal. \"But then it became the biggest urban record ... ever,\" [Hermansen] said.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52587", "text": "\"Irreplaceable\" is a mid-tempo ballad with pop and R&B influences. Written in the key of B\u266d major, the beat is set in common time and moves at a moderate 88 beats per minute. Beyonc\u00e9's vocal range in the song spans nearly two and a half octaves, from B\u266d2 to E\u266d5. While most of the songs on the album are aggressive and uptempo, her voice on \"Irreplaceable\" is toned down. \"Irreplaceable\" uses a gently strummed acoustic guitar, following the B\u266d5\u2013F5\u2013Cm7\u2013E\u266d6/9 chord series. Hermansen and Eriksen combined the classic chord progression on an acoustic guitar, a modern-sounding 808 drum beat and cellos. Al Shipley of Stylus Magazine noted that the guitar strum can be found in Rihanna's 2007 single \"Hate That I Love You\", a song co-produced by Stargate and Ne-Yo.  Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote that Chris Brown's 2007 single \"With You\", another Stargate-produced song, also features the same element. He wrote, \"'With You' is the convincer, even if you can instantly tell that producer Stargate was just trying to roll out 'Irreplaceable' one more time.\" while Billboard magazine wrote that it \"leans a bit too heavily\" to the song.\n\nJim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that \"Irreplaceable\" resembles ballads sung by Whitney Houston. Spence D. of IGN wrote that the song was inspired by Aretha Franklin's work since \"Irreplaceable\" consists of several variations in gutturals and octave range.

Beyonc\u00e9 said that the song is \"a little honest\", and, \"... basically we can't forget our power and our worth. And sometimes you're so in love, you forget that. And sometimes you feel like you're not being appreciated. And sometimes they forget that they can be replaced.\"The song's lyrics are constructed in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form. It begins with guitar strumming, and Beyonc\u00e9 sings the hook-intro, \"To the left, to the left: everything you own in a box to the left\". In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing with her boyfriend about the indifference of their relationship, and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus and chorus follow, \"You must not know 'bout me ... I can have another you by tomorrow / I could have another you in a minute ... Don't you ever for a second get to thinking / You're irreplaceable\". In the second verse, Beyonc\u00e9 recollects the moment she discovered her boyfriend's infidelity. The same pattern leads to the second chorus. Towards the end, Beyonc\u00e9 sings the bridge, where she tells her lover, \"Replacing you is so easy\". The song closes with an ad-libbed chorus.

Shortly after the release of \"Irreplaceable\", Beyonc\u00e9 told MTV: \"I love 'Irreplaceable'. I think it's important to have those songs.

Although the album failed to reach any major music charts, it did receive positive reviews from critics, and helped establish a steady fanbase for the band. After the release of The Unraveling, guitarist Dan Wleklinski left the band due to personal differences with lead vocalist Tim McIlrath; he was eventually replaced by Todd Mohney, McIlrath's roommate and former bandmate.When it came time to record Rise Against's second album, Revolutions per Minute, McIlrath noted that the band was suffering from an \"identity crisis\". At the time, Fat Wreck Chords had a specific pop punk sound, so the band members wanted to find a producer who could help distinguish them from the other bands on the label, and highlight the heavier aspects of their music. Sonic Iguana Studios, where Rise Against recorded The Unraveling, and another studio in San Francisco were both busy at the time, leaving the band members only thirty days to record. They decided on Bill Stevenson\u2014the former drummer of the punk band Descendents\u2014and Jason Livermore to produce the album.Before the recording process began, the band members wrote songs for the album above an antique store in Chicago, an environment that McIlrath described as \"roach-infested\". Revolutions per Minute was recorded at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, from November to December 2002. Stevenson and Livermore produced the album; Stevenson also served as the engineer and mixer, while Livermore mastered the album. McIlrath commented that Stevenson was the perfect person to produce the album, as he not only understood the nuances of the band, but was also their \"musical soul mate\".

These comments were echoed by Punknews.org's Aubin Paul, who noted the album's overall \"darker\" tone.The first track on Revolutions per Minute is \"Black Masks & Gasoline\", which features \"power chords\" and rapid drumming. Its lyrics advocate for a revolution against a vengeful government, and contain imagery of raised hands and clenched fists. The second track, \"Heaven Knows\", makes use of \"serrated, slingshot hooks\", with lyrics that deal with \"personal strife\". The next track, \"Dead Ringer\", is a short hardcore song that chastises those who felt that the band had sold out due to their growing popularity. Jo-Ann Greene of AllMusic believes that \"Halfway There\" is about the need for a real leader and questioning the current leaders' action, bolstered by McIlrath's screaming vocals.The fifth track, \"Like the Angel\", begins with strumming of the bass guitar, before transitioning into a \"poppy\" beat about unrequited love. \"Voices Off Camera:\" is one of the more accessible songs on the album, with McIlrath singing in a softer voice. In contrast, \"Blood-Red, White, & Blue\" is described by Matthew Fiander of PopMatters as a \"musical tour de force\", with a moody breakdown. With it, McIlrath wanted to write a song that showcased the conflict of interests following the September 11 attacks, between overt patriotism, and war crimes in the name of God. The eighth track, \"Broken English\", \"switches tempo constantly\", and has motivational lyrics in the chorus. McIlrath describes \"Last Chance Blueprint\" as the band's \"escape song\", while Fiander feels it is a \"stock get-out-of-town tune\". It contains a soundbite from the 1999 film American Beauty.\"To the Core\" is another short hardcore song that Greene describes as \"a ferocious, fever-pitched number written and delivered with pure vitriol\". McIlarth notes that \"Torches\" is a very different when compared to most of the band's material, due to its heavy metal-influenced intro and breakdown. The penultimate track, \"Amber Changing\", is more muted in its sound, and has McIlrath sing about not wanting a great moment in a relationship to end.

Medley formed the group with Hatfield in 1963.

Their most active recording period was in the 1960s and '70s, and, after several years inactive as a duo, Hatfield and Medley reunited in 1981 and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003. The term \"blue-eyed soul\" is thought to have first been coined by Philadelphia radio DJ Georgie Woods in 1964 when describing the duo's music.Hatfield and Medley had contrasting vocal ranges, which helped them create a distinctive sound as a duet. They each had the vocal talent to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his bass-baritone voice, with Hatfield taking the higher-register vocals with his tenor. His voice reached the register of a countertenor.Following a year and a half of Top 40 non-entries on Billboard's Hot 100, the duo hit big with the late-1964 release of what would become their signature record, \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" \u2013 a transatlantic number one produced by Phil Spector, often considered one of his finest works and a landmark recording in popular music. Other notable hits include three US 1965 Top Tens \u2013 \"Just Once in My Life\" and covers of \"Unchained Melody\" (also a huge hit in 1990 after being featured in the film Ghost) and \"Ebb Tide\" \u2013 and the massive US 1966 number one \"(You're My) Soul and Inspiration\", plus the 1974 comeback hit \"Rock and Roll Heaven\".

It was called the Tenderloin, and it was where there were seedy clubs, bars, prostitutes... it was the underbelly of San Francisco. I can't remember why I was there - I wasn't going to a massage parlor or anything. Maybe I was going downtown to Macy's or something like that. But in front of massage parlors and houses of prostitution, they used to have these little kiosks. Out in front of this one massage parlor there was a kiosk that was like a phone booth. It was enclosed, and the sign said, \"PAY A DOLLAR, TALK TO A NAKED GIRL.\"\nIt was supposed to arouse you so you would go into the \"happy ending\" type of massage parlor. It had been there for years, and I'd never done anything like that before, but for some reason, I went up to it and put a dollar in the thing because I was curious. You put a dollar in, the wall slides down, and there is a girl in there who is scantily clad. She starts disrobing, at the same time talking about, \"Hey baby, come on in. We'll take care of you.\" I was such a rube and so na\u00efve. It was this gorgeous girl, and I'm going, \"What are you doing this for? You're so gorgeous, why are you doing this? You could be a model.\" She completely ignored whatever I said and kept giving her speech, her spiel. \"Yeah, come on honey, come in.\" Before she would actually take anything off, the thing would come down again, and it was, \"Pay another dollar.\" So, I put in another dollar!\n\nWe were looking for new Tubes dancers because we had lost our dancers between the last album and this one, so I kept saying, \"You can be a dancer in The Tubes. Can you dance? Can you sing?\" And she just completely ignored me.\nOriginally, the chorus was intended to include the line \"You can talk to a naked girl,\" but producer David Foster convinced Waybill to change the lyric to the less offensive \"You can talk to a pretty girl.\" Foster was also the source for the song's title, which Waybill characterized as indicative of Foster's Canadian nationality.

Ortega achieved greater success choreographing movies such as Dirty Dancing and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and as a director with High School Musical and its sequels.\nInitially, the music video was intended to feature a version of a freak show based on the film Freaks; this was ultimately rejected by the record company as \"too weird,\" so the band instead came up with the idea of the carnival ride. Other ideas were also blocked by the record company; Waybill recalled, \"They constantly censored us...We had a topless mermaid, and of course, that was right out - we had to change that, and a bunch of stuff. It was just a little too weird for MTV. We had a great big paper breast - a big screen with an air-brushed breast on it. And the guy in the ride for 'She's a Beauty' would go crashing through it.

Records in the US. As a result of the Sex Pistols' volatile internal relationships, the band's lineup saw changes during the recording of the album. Original bass guitarist Glen Matlock left the band early in the recording process, and while he is credited as a co-writer on all but two of the tracks, he only played bass and sang backing vocals on one track, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" Recording sessions continued with a new bass player, Sid Vicious, who is credited on two of the songs written by the band after he joined. While Vicious's bass playing appeared on two tracks, his lack of skill on the instrument meant that many of the tracks were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones playing bass instead. Drummer Paul Cook, Jones and singer Johnny Rotten appear on every track. The various recording sessions were led alternately by Chris Thomas or Bill Price, and sometimes both together, but as the songs on the final albums often combined mixes from different sessions, or were poorly documented who was present in the recording booth at the time, each song is jointly credited to both producers.\nBy the time of its release, the Sex Pistols were already controversial, having spoken profanity on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from playing live in some parts of Britain. The album title added to that controversy, with some people finding the word \"bollocks\" offensive. Many record stores refused to carry it and some record charts refused to list its title, showing just a blank space instead. Due in part to its notoriety, and in spite of many sales bans at major retailers, the album debuted at number one on the UK Album Charts. It achieved advance orders of 125,000 copies after a week of its release and went gold only a few weeks later, on 17 November. It remained a best-seller for nearly a year, spending 48 weeks in the top 75. The album has also been certified platinum by the RIAA. It has seen several reissues, the latest in 2017.\nThe album has influenced many bands and musicians, and the industry in general. In particular, the album's raw energy, and Johnny Rotten's sneering delivery and \"half-singing\", are often considered game changing. It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album, and one of the greatest and most important albums of all time. In 1987, Rolling Stone magazine named the album the second best of the previous 20 years, behind only the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The same magazine ranked it 73rd on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2020. In 2006, it was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest albums ever.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_52717", "text": "With the completion of \"Bodies\", the time came to finalise the album's track list. Though Jon Savage wrote there were three versions of each track available, Heylin states that alternative versions for only five tracks (\"E.M.I.\", \"No Feelings\", \"Seventeen\" and \"Submission\", plus an \"album\" mix of \"Satellite\") existed. It was not until 20 September that the track list was finalised, which Heylin said \"suggests just how bogged down by the process they had become\". Richard Branson spent the night deciding the track list and which versions to use, and included all the hits on the record, despite the objections of the band, McLaren's management company Glitterbest and most of Virgin. Due to the album's long completion time, the Sex Pistols and McLaren decided to release \"Holidays in the Sun\" backed with \"Satellite\" as the band's fourth single. \"Holidays in the Sun\" was not as successful as past singles\u2014it charted at number eight and dropped out of the top 20 after four weeks\u2014which Heylin attributed to the group's announcement that their album would be released on 4 November and that the single would be included on the LP, despite previous statements to the contrary. In an attempt to stem criticism over the decision to include all four previously released Sex Pistols singles on the forthcoming LP, Virgin indicated the possibility of an \"alternative album\" being issued simultaneously, featuring a new title and two new songs replacing \"two of the former hit singles\". A label spokesman stated, \"We've put the singles on the LP because most people wanted it that way. But the alternative set would enable us to overcome the multiple stores' ban\". A ten-song test pressing was made, though no new cuts were included, with \"Satellite\" and \"Submission\" being added as bonus tracks.The Sex Pistols' contract with Virgin stated that its music would be distributed by Virgin in the United States provided Branson matched any competing offers McLaren received. However, McLaren wanted to negotiate separate deals in every territory, regardless of what the contract stipulated, which angered Branson, as the clause for American distribution was an important one he had fought for. Branson knew he had been outmanoeuvred by McLaren, for he could not sue to enforce the contract or else be perceived as acting like EMI or A&M. Competition for the band in the United States narrowed down to Warner Bros., Arista, Columbia and Casablanca Records, with Warner Bros. signing the band on 10 October for \u00a322,000.Before Virgin could release Never Mind the Bollocks, Branson discovered that two other Sex Pistols albums were competing with his label's. In October, a bootleg named Spunk featuring high-quality recordings of Sex Pistols demos and recording sessions with Dave Goodman was released on a label called Blank. Among the rumours of who was behind the release of the tapes included Goodman, Glen Matlock and McLaren, who has always considered Goodman's versions to be a more accurate representation of the band. Meanwhile, the French pressing of Never Mind the Bollocks on Barclay had added \"Submission\" to the slated 11-song track list, and was due for release a week before Virgin's edition. As McLaren's separate deal with Barclay meant that the French release could not be halted and given the Virgin head was aware of how easy it was for import records to arrive in Britain, Branson rushed production of Never Mind the Bollocks to ensure it would come out a week earlier than intended. Nevertheless, the Barclay version was already available in the UK at the time Virgin had its version ready. Ten thousand copies of Virgin's pressing erroneously only listed 11 tracks on the sleeve yet contained 12 on the actual record.Even with the availability of Spunk, the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols was eagerly awaited in the United Kingdom.

Jamie Reid's cover concept refrained from including a picture of the group and instead was dayglo red and yellow in colour with cutout lettering and a finish resembling crude screen-prints while the US version was pink with a green Sex Pistols logo. The album's title changed in mid-1977, based on a phrase supplied by Steve Jones. Jones said he picked up the phrase \"Never mind the bollocks\" from two fans who would always say it to one another. Johnny Rotten explained its meaning as a working-class expression to \"stop talking rubbish\".In the United Kingdom, the album was subject to what Heylin described as \"blatant acts of censorship exercised by media and retail outlets alike\". London police visited the city's Virgin record store branches and told them they faced prosecution for indecency as stipulated by the 1899 Indecent Advertisements Act if they continued to display posters of the album cover in their windows. The displays were either toned down or removed. However, on 9 November 1977 (just two days before the album was released in the US), the London Evening Standard announced on its front-page headline \"Police Move in on Punk Disc Shops\", and reported how a Virgin Records shop manager in Nottingham was arrested for displaying the record after being warned to cover up the word \"bollocks\". Chris Seale, the shop's manager, \"it would appear, willingly set himself up as a target, possibly at Branson's behest\", according to Heylin, who noted that he had been visited by the police on four occasions and resumed displaying copies of the record in the store windows after they had left on each occasion. After Seale's arrest, Branson announced that he would cover the manager's legal costs and hired Queen's Counsel John Mortimer as defence. Meanwhile, advertisements for Never Mind the Bollocks appearing in music papers attempted to politicise the issue, showing newspaper headlines about Sex Pistols controversies that were underlined with the message \"THE ALBUM WILL LAST. THE SLEEVE MAY NOT.\"The obscenity case was heard at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 24 November. Mortimer presented the case as a matter of police discrimination. During his cross-examination of the arresting officer, he asked why the newspapers The Guardian and Evening Standard (which had referred to the album's name) had not been charged under the same act. When the overseeing magistrate inquired about his line of questioning, Mortimer stated that a double standard was apparently at play, and that \"bollocks\" was only considered obscene when it appeared on the cover of a Sex Pistols album. The prosecutor conducted his cross-examination \"as if the album itself, and not its lurid visage, was on trial for indecency\", according to Heylin. Mortimer produced an expert witness, Professor James Kinsley, Head of the School of English at the University of Nottingham, who argued that the word \"bollocks\" was not obscene, and was actually a legitimate Old English term formerly used to refer to a priest, and which, in the context of the title, meant \"nonsense\". Lawyer Geoffrey Robertson, who appeared with Mortimer, recalled the professor saying that early English translations of the Bible used \"bollocks\" to refer to testicles, this being replaced by the word \"stones\" in the King James Version of the Bible, at which point Rotten handed Robertson a note saying, \"Don't worry. If we lose the case, we'll retitle the album Never Mind the Stones, Here's the Sex Pistols\".

The forbidden ideas from which Rotten makes songs take on undeniable truth value, whether one is sympathetic ('Holidays in the Sun' is a hysterically frightening vision of global economics) or filled with loathing ('Bodies,' an indictment from which Rotten doesn't altogether exclude himself, is effectively anti-abortion, anti-woman, and anti-sex). These ideas must be dealt with, and can be expected to affect the way fans think and behave. The chief limitation on their power is the music, which can get heavy occasionally, but the only real question is how many American kids might feel the way Rotten does, and where he and they will go next.

It was written by the Spice Girls, Matt Rowe and Richard \"Biff\" Stannard and produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album, Spice, released in November 1996. \"Wannabe\" is a dance-pop song that features Mel B and Geri Halliwell rapping. The lyrics, which address the value of female friendship over heterosexual relationships, became a symbol of female empowerment and the most emblematic song of the group's girl power philosophy. It was written and recorded quickly. The result was considered lacklustre by their label and was sent to be mixed by Dave Way. The Spice Girls were not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, by Mark \"Spike\" Stent.\n\"Wannabe\" was heavily promoted. Its music video, directed by Johan Camitz, became a success on the British cable network the Box, which sparked press interest in the group. Subsequently, the song had intensive radio airplay across England, while the Spice Girls performed it on television and began doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines.\nResponding to the wave of interest, Virgin released the song as the Spice Girls' debut single in Japan in June 1996 and in the UK the following month, well ahead of the planned release of the Spice album. \"Wannabe\" topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and has received a quadruple platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It was released in the United States in January 1997, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was the group's only number-one single in that country. By the end of 1996, \"Wannabe\" had topped the charts in 22 nations, and by March 1997 this number had climbed to 37.Despite mixed reviews from critics, \"Wannabe\" won for Best British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards and for British Single of the Year at the 1997 Brit Awards. \"Wannabe\" became the best-selling single by a girl group, with 1,385,211 copies sold in United Kingdom by 2017, 2,910,000 in the United States by 2014, and more than 7 million copies worldwide by the end of 1997.

The group moved to a house in Maidenhead and received the name \"Touch\". Stephenson was eventually fired because she lacked the drive of the other group members. She was replaced by Emma Bunton. In November, the group\u2014now named \"Spice\"\u2014persuaded their managers to set up a showcase in front of industry writers, producers, and A&R men at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush, London. Producer Richard Stannard, at the studio for a meeting with pop star Jason Donovan, attended the showcase after hearing Brown, as she went charging across the corridor.

Chris Herbert booked the group's first professional songwriting session with the producers at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, East London, in January 1995. Rowe recalls feelings similar to Stannard's: \"I love them. Immediately. ... They were like no one I'd met before, really.\" The session was productive; Stannard and Rowe discussed the songwriting process with the group and talked about what the group wanted to do on the record.

Stannard commented that the only pre-planned concept for the song was that it should represent the essence of what they were. The group then added their own contributions to the song, Rowe recalls:\n\nThey made all these different bits up, not thinking in terms of verse, chorus, bridge or what was going to go where, just coming up with all these sections of chanting, rapping and singing, which we recorded all higgledy-piggledy. And then we just sewed it together. It was rather like the way we'd been working on the dance remixes we'd been doing before.

During the session, Brown and Bunton came up with the idea of including a rap near the end of the song. At this point the group became highly motivated, and incorporated the word \"zigazig-ah\" into the lyrics. Chisholm told Billboard: \"You know when you're in a gang and you're having a laugh and you make up silly words? Well we were having a giggle and we made up this silly word, zigazig-ah.

In her autobiography, she wrote: \"I just couldn't bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn't matter, it did matter.

Written in the key of B major, it is set in the time signature of common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 110 beats per minute. It uses the sequence B\u2013D\u2013E\u2013A\u2013A\u266f as a bass line during the refrain, the chorus, and the bridge, and uses a chord progression of F\u266f\u2013G\u266fm\u2013E\u2013B for the verses. The song is constructed in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a rapped bridge before the third and final chorus. Musically, it is \"energised\" by a highly syncopated synthesised riff, and by the way the repetitive lyrics and rhythm are highlighted during the bridge. \"Wannabe\" presents a different version of the traditional pop love song performed by females; its energetic, self-assertive style expresses a confident independence that is not reliant on the male figure for its continuance.The song opens with Halliwell's laugh, followed by \"undislodgeable piano notes\" inspired by the Grease \"Summer Nights\" bassline. The first lines of the refrain are rapped in a call and response interaction between Brown and Halliwell. The words \"tell\", \"really\" and \"I wanna\" are repeated, so that the vocal tone and lyrics build up an image of female self-assertion. The refrain ends with the word \"zigazig-ah\", which musicologist Sheila Whiteley compared to the neologisms created by Lewis Carroll; other writers have considered it a euphemism for female sexual desire, which is ambiguously sexualised or broadly economic. The first verse follows; Chisholm, Bunton, Brown, and Halliwell sing one line individually, in that order. In this part, the lyrics have a pragmatic sense of control of the situation; they begin, \"If you want my future, forget my past.\" This, according to Whiteley, taps directly into the emotions of the young teenage audience.During the chorus, the lyrics\u2014\"If you wanna be my lover/You gotta get with my friends\"\u2014address the value of female friendship over romantic relationships, while the ascending group of chords and the number of voices creates a sense of power that adds to the song's level of excitement.

Though he had numerous hit records, he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of Cole Porter's \"Begin the Beguine.\" Before the release of \"Beguine,\" Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and, after its release, he became a major pop artist within short order. The record eventually became one of the era's defining recordings. Musically restless, Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as Third Stream music, which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions. His music influenced other musicians, such as Monty Norman in England, whose \"James Bond Theme\" features a vamp possibly influenced by Shaw's 1938 recording of \"Nightmare\".Shaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the big bands he led. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1942 to 1944, during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific. Following his discharge in 1944, he returned to lead a band through 1945.

It features four standards, two originals by the bassist, and a jam by the group credited to Hawes. While there's nothing particularly arresting or startling about the date, the relationship between the two ostensible co-leaders is a good case study in group dynamics when deference between two strong-willed individualists turns into a certain amount of compromise. Drummer Danny Richmond is not so much the peacemaker or even mediator, and he is the one with the most common sense who actually pulls this triad into a simpatico unit, cooling the embers with his steady, willful-in-its-own-right playing. As complex as the music of Mingus tends to be, it's nice to hear what he does in a more simplified area. His \"Back Home Blues\" is so basic as his bass leads out, while the Mingus chart \"Dizzy Moods\" is deeper within an easier swing, allowing darker colors to fully but slowly blossom. Richmond overdubs the tambourine on \"Dizzy Moods\" and the hip \"A Night in Tunisia\"-styled take of \"Summertime,\" while a faster \"Hamp's New Blues\" bops along effortlessly, chided by the drummer's accents. Hawes shines in his gilded, rearranged concept of \"Yesterdays,\" intentionally messing up the changes for the first few bars before settling in, while slowing the Vernon Duke evergreen \"I Can't Get Started\" (always a personal staple of the Mingus book) to a crawl. The most intriguing selection comes at the end, as \"Laura\" sounds derived from \"Tea for Two,\" with the hardy upright of Mingus sallying forth about this imaginary woman made real through this poignant song. Some six years later, Mingus, Duke Ellington, and Max Roach would record the controversial trio effort Money Jungle, so in many ways this album is a prelude to that all-star combination, both one-shots and definitely sidebars to the careers of all of these brilliant jazzmen.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52784", "text": "All compositions by Charles Mingus except as indicated\n\n\"Yesterdays\" (Otto Harbach, Jerome Kern) - 4:13\n\"Back Home Blues\" - 5:29\n\"I Can't Get Started\" (Vernon Duke, Ira Gershwin) - 6:28\n\"Hamp's New Blues\" (Hampton Hawes) - 3:52\n\"Summertime\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin, DuBose Heyward) - 4:28\n\"Dizzy Moods\" - 6:51\n\"Laura\" (Johnny Mercer, David Raksin) - 6:33", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52785", "text": "Charles Mingus - bass\nHampton Hawes - piano\nDannie Richmond - drums, tambourine (overdubbed)\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was released on September 6, 2010, by the independent record label Plug Research, his first album for the label.\nBilal began composing music for the album using the recording software GarageBand, while touring in the aftermath of his unreleased but widely leaked album Love for Sale. He wrote and recorded Airtight's Revenge during a period of approximately three years, working alongside the musician-producers Steve McKie, Nottz, Shafiq Husayn, Conley \"Tone\" Whitfield, and 88-Keys. The album's soul and rock music is more electronic- and guitar-oriented than Bilal's previous albums, featuring influences from jazz, blues, and futurism. Experiences from his personal life and professional conflicts with his former label, Interscope Records, formed the inspiration for the album's dark songwriting, which explores themes of love, spirituality, capitalism, and politics, with lyrics informed by free thought.\nThe album debuted at number 106 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 4,600 copies in its first week. Although it charted modestly, Airtight's Revenge was well received by music critics upon its release. PopMatters ranked the album number 61 in its year-end list of best albums for 2010, calling it a \"wildly inventive, wildly enjoyable album\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_52789", "text": "Bilal worked on the album intermittently for approximately three years, with the singer saying he began creating its music \"around 2008\". While touring in response to the popularity of Love for Sale, his controversially shelved but leaked album, Bilal began composing new music on his computer using the digital audio workstation GarageBand. Recalling the process, he says, \"It sort of starts on the piano and then I go to the Garage Band and make, like, a little sketch of something I can sing to and then go from there. It allows me play around with the shape of the song more.\" The songs were variously written in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Amsterdam.When writing the lyrics, Bilal says he wanted to approach expressing free thought in different ways and tried to \"write short stories and dark tales of life in general\". He drew inspiration from his personal experiences, as well as \"a lot of things from fiction\" in an effort to \"make certain statements, from a love standpoint\", he explains. Bilal adds that his experience with Love for Sale and the ensuing conflict with his then-record label Interscope led him to the \"dark underworld\" storytelling of Airtight's Revenge.\nAfter hearing some of Bilal's GarageBand compositions, his touring drummer persuaded him to record one of the songs at the former's studio. By doing so, Bilal felt inspired to record further. In the studio, the singer held improvisatory sessions with his accompanying musicians, comparing it to jazz or \"a Led Zeppelin show\". In contrast to his previous albums, Bilal pursued a more guitar-led direction based in rock and soul, with influences from jazz, blues, and electronic music. He utilized ideas from the music of Frank Zappa, who he says \"was dope at that; mixing a lot different artists in a band to create one distinct sound\". Recording with a smaller budget than previously for Interscope, he found that \"you don't need to be in a gigantic studio, you just need to be in a good room with acoustics and be creative with how you mic things or use things.\"\n\nBilal collaborated with producers Shafiq Husayn, Nottz, 88-Keys, and, most prominently, Steve McKie. A drummer-producer who had recorded with the singer on Love for Sale, McKie was eager to work on Airtight's Revenge after listening to Bilal's preliminary compositions on GarageBand. McKie began recording with Bilal in late 2008, starting with 13 compositions and eventually co-producing seven of the album's songs. As McKie explains, \"We just went through a bunch of sounds, locked ourselves in the studio and experimented with different snare drums and kicks. It took a bunch of time because we had that freedom to just experiment and be creative.\" In an interview soon after the album's release in late 2010, Bilal said that he and McKie \"put the finishing touches and tightened everything up over the last year\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_52790", "text": "Airtight's Revenge has been described as a mix of soul, rock, jazz, blues, and electronic styles. Referencing Bilal's intention to create music that would challenge a computer, Pitchfork writer Marcus J. Moore says it explains the music's \"iconoclastic nature\" and how it \"largely eschewed Bilal's earlier throwback aesthetic for a denser electronic sound\". According to NPR's Frannie Kelley, \"the sound here is more electronic than the neo-soul of the Soulquarians' heyday ... The production is heavily layered, with several Bilals often singing at once.\" Prefixmag.com's Andrew Martin says it \"owes more to contemporary album-oriented indie rock than pop, R&B or hip-hop\", while Michael Hewlett from the Winston-Salem Journal calls it \"sped-up rock and jazz\". In the opinion of HipHopDX journalist Luke Gibson, \"the production is to [sic] experimental to be called Neo Soul, to [sic] funky to be called Acid Jazz, and to [sic] free-form to be Funk\".\n\nLyrically, the album explores a wider range of subjects than Bilal's previous albums, including love, spirituality, politics, economics, and religion. Evan Rytlewski of The A.V.

Just the whole long, drawn-out standstill behind it and how it kind of turned into a phoenix-rising type of deal, with people giving it mad love online and just became this underground type of sensation. So that's the real revenge, the music couldn't be shut down or hidden, but people got it and they loved it, just like I loved making it. That was the meaning behind 'revenge,' and 'Airtight' is just an old nickname that I got.\nBack in the day, I used to really be into reading Donald Goines and Iceberg Slim. I casually read both of their whole catalogs, and they inspired me as a songwriter also, but there's a book Iceberg Slim wrote and the title is Airtight Willie & Me. I kind of kept that name, 'Airtight.' And I think even back then I thought it would be dope to have an album with the title Airtight-something, so Airtight's Revenge sounded like a black exploitation film. It kind of fit the scenario.\nThe album's cover art is a reference to the iconic photo of Malcolm X peering through his window while holding a M1 carbine rifle. Instead of a rifle, Bilal is holding a microphone, and instead of peering through his bedroom curtain, Bilal is peering through a heavy red stage curtain. In an interview with Parlour Magazine, Bilal elaborated on the message behind the album's cover art, stating:\n\nI'm killing them with the words. This album was my version of Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" and a retrospective look on the world and where we are today. There\u2019s not a lot of music like that these days.

In June 1998, Prince resumed the project, creating a \"reworked\" version of the title track, and enlisting help from other musicians, such as Gwen Stefani, Eve, and Sheryl Crow.

Andrews was born in Seattle, Washington, and attended film school in Los Angeles before his band Failure received a record deal from Slash Records.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_52867", "text": "He is best known as co-founder, lead vocalist, guitarist, bassist and co-songwriter of the alternative rock band Failure. He has also played in Replicants, a cover band side project that also included members of Tool. After the breakup of Failure in 1997, he also recorded music under the moniker ON, and later assembled and fronted the band Year of the Rabbit. He has performed as a solo artist, as well as collaborating in a self-described \"digital band\" called Digital Noise Academy with Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Sharky Laguana (Creeper Lagoon), Jordon Zadorozny, and Charlotte Martin (whom Andrews married in 2005), among others. In 2014, Andrews reunited with Failure members Greg Edwards and Kellii Scott. They embarked on a North American tour, which included two dates performing alongside A Perfect Circle and Puscifer for the celebration of Maynard James Keenan's 50th birthday.\nApart from his work as a musician, Andrews has also produced and/or mixed material for many artists, such as Nine Inch Nails, Beck, Lostprophets, Pete Yorn, A Perfect Circle, Tenacious D, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Candlebox, Mae, and others. Also notable is his participation in the production of \"You Know My Name\", the theme for the 2006 James Bond movie Casino Royale, performed by Soundgarden/ex-Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell.\nIn March 2007, Andrews released Secrets of the Lost Satellite, his first solo album under his own name, and helped oversee its release via his own label, Dinosaur Fight Records. The initial inspiration for the album came when he was invited by Beck to contribute to songs that he and his backing band were working on for the Nacho Libre soundtrack, recording sessions which Andrews described as \"one of the most exciting of my life\". Beck's live musical director, session musician Justin Meldal-Johnsen, was already a friend of Andrews', and shortly afterward, they and other members of Beck's band (including Matt Mahaffey of Self) began working on material that eventually became the album. Andrews also brought in another old friend, Jordon Zadorozny of Blinker the Star, to assist with songwriting and arrangements, and Zadorozny also ended up playing various instruments on some songs, as well. Both Meldal-Johnsen and Zadorozny are listed as co-producers of Secrets of the Lost Satellite. Andrews went on tour that spring for the first time since 2003, with the opening band, San Diego's First Wave Hello, also serving as his backing band.\nThe members of Failure and Tool have been friends since the early 1990s; the two bands toured together repeatedly, and some members collaborated occasionally. Andrews is often credited for directing the music video for Tool's \"Hush\", but this is incorrect. He did, however, edit the video for their later single \"Prison Sex\". Andrews is also mistakenly credited with involvement in the post-grunge arena-rock band Neon Steam Dreams; that Andrews is a different musician by the same name.  In May 2014, the Cinquanta concert with Tool, A Perfect Circle and Failure was held as a 50th Birthday Celebration for Maynard James Keenan, who asked for the band to reunite for that concert. Keenan stated, \"This was the perfect opportunity to tick off one of my bucket list items in the form of a Failure reunion. What better birthday present could one ever hope for?\" Failure, however, performed their first reunion show at the El Rey Theater on February 13, 2014, before the event.He was featured on an episode of WIRED Science discussing the pros and cons of digital vs. analog recording. Andrews argued that more can be done (with greater ease) with digital while Steve Albini argued that he can accomplish just as much with analog.\nOn the October 28, 2020, Andrews released a five song EP entitled What's Coming. This was his first release of new solo work since 2007's Secrets of the Lost Satellite. Single track \"Sword and Shield\" has a music video directed by Andrews, which stars David Dastmalchian. This video is intended as a criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump, opening with a shot of a MAGA drum kit, with Dastmalchian lip syncing to the song dressed as Trump.

While that project failed to materialise\u2014with More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies) being released in its place\u2014most of the unreleased songs were held over for a future project. \nIn February 1974, to give it an air of authority, Bill Wyman involved himself in compiling an album he entitled Black Box. However, Allen Klein wanted more Mick Jagger/Keith Richards songs in the project for monetary reasons, and Wyman's version remained unreleased. Metamorphosis was issued in its place.\nWyman's original picks for the record were as follows:\n\n\"Bright Lights Big City\"\n\"Cops and Robbers\"\n\"I'd Much Rather Be With the Boys\"\n\"Little Red Rooster\" (Live)\n\"Down the Road Apiece\" (Live)\n\"Don't Lie to Me\"\n\"If You Let Me\"\n\"Godzi\"\n\"Panama Powder Room\"\n\"Gold Painted Nails\"\n\"Fannie Mae\"\n\"Down in the Bottom\"\"Godzi\" and \"Panama Powder Room\" were instrumentals from the Between the Buttons sessions and have never been released. They were recorded at RCA Studios, Hollywood on August 4-12, 1966. \nMost tracks that appear on side one of the vinyl album are demos, written by Jagger and Richards for other artists to perform. Some were recorded with session musicians like Big Jim Sullivan on guitar, Clem Cattini on drums, and Jimmy Page on guitar, and were not intended for release by the Rolling Stones. Indeed, on most of these tracks the only Rolling Stone who appears is Jagger. \"Out of Time\" and \"Heart of Stone\" were well-known Stones songs that appear here in drastically different renditions, with session players providing the backing. Side two includes unreleased band recordings up until the Sticky Fingers sessions of 1970. \nWith some speculation that \"I'd Much Rather Be With the Boys\" had a homosexual subtext, The Toggery Five version changed the lyric to \"I'd rather be out with the boys.\" An alternate version of \"Memo from Turner\" includes Brian Jones on guitar and has a looser vibe than the Mick Jagger solo single from the soundtrack album of the 1970 film Performance. \nReleased in June 1975, Metamorphosis came out the same day as the band's authorised hits collection Made in the Shade and was also seen to be cashing in on the Rolling Stones' summer Tour of the Americas. While the critical reception was lukewarm, Metamorphosis still managed to reach No. 8 in the US, though it only made No. 45 in the UK.

At AbsolutePunk, Gregory Robson gave the album an 80%, and wrote that \"Kenny Chesney's fifteenth studio album is nowhere near his best and nowhere near his worst. What it is though is occasionally pleasing, horribly derivative and way too self-indulgent.\" Robson went on to state that \"Welcome to the Fishbowl is anything but first-rate.

In 1955, he married Galina Vishnevskaya, a leading soprano at the Bolshoi Theatre.Rostropovich had working relationships with Soviet composers of the era. In 1949 Sergei Prokofiev wrote his Cello Sonata, Op. 119, for the 22-year-old Rostropovich, who gave the first performance in 1950, with Sviatoslav Richter. Prokofiev also dedicated his Symphony-Concerto to him; this was premiered in 1952. Rostropovich and Dmitry Kabalevsky completed Prokofiev's Cello Concertino after the composer's death. Shostakovich wrote both his first and second cello concertos for Rostropovich, who also gave their first performances.Rostropovich went on several tours in Western Europe and met several composers, including Benjamin Britten, who dedicated his Cello Sonata, three Solo Suites, and his Cello Symphony to Rostropovich. Rostropovich gave their first performances, and the two had a special affinity; Rostropovich's family described him as \"always smiling\" when discussing \"Ben\", and on his deathbed he was said to have expressed no fear as he and Britten would, he believed, be reunited in Heaven.Britten was also renowned as a pianist and together they recorded, among other works, Schubert's Sonata for Arpeggione and Piano in A minor.

In one, \n\"Bob Dylan's Dream\" recalls the times Dylan had spent in Greenwich Village with comedian Hugh Romney and their friends during the early 1960s. Romney, later to become Wavy Gravy of Woodstock and Merry Pranksters fame, lived above The Gaslight Cafe on MacDougal Street, where he worked as entertainment director. The two first met at the Gaslight in the spring of 1961. Dylan approached Romney about the possibility of performing and began appearing regularly at the Gaslight's hootenannies. Within a few months, he debuted at the Gaslight as a featured act.Dylan frequently hung out upstairs in Romney's apartment and wrote one of his most significant songs there, \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", in August 1962 . The next winter, in late January or early February 1963, he wrote \"Bob Dylan's Dream\" possibly as a nostalgic remembrance of his early days in the Village when his life was less complex.A differing account, by biographer and critic Robert Shelton, posits that the song concerns the lost innocence of Dylan's adolescence in Hibbing, Minnesota. John Bucklen, one of Dylan's closest friends in Hibbing in the mid-1950s, told Shelton he and Dylan used to venture out to his sister's house, where they would play guitar and sing verses. \"When I heard the song 'Bob Dylan's Dream',\" he said, \"I couldn't help but think that some of the sessions we had at my sister's house were part of that 'Dream.'\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53142", "text": "According to Shelton, Dylan credited the melody of \"Bob Dylan's Dream\" to the traditional broadside ballad \"Lord Franklin\" (also known as \"Lady Franklin's Lament\" and \"The Sailor's Dream\"), which he learned from British folksinger Martin Carthy, while visiting London in late December 1962.However, Dylan may have learned the song even earlier from his Village friend Paul Clayton, who had recorded it in 1957 for his album Whaling and Sailing Songs: From the Days of Moby Dick on Folkways. In either case, within a couple weeks after returning from London in January 1963, Dylan began playing \"Bob Dylan's Dream\" for Gil Turner during after-hours sessions at Gerde's Folk City, where Turner was emcee.Besides the melody, Dylan's song also shares lyrical similarities with \"Lady Franklin's Lament\", as in the song's closing lines:\nTen thousand dollars at the drop of a hat\nI'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.\n\"Lady Franklin's Lament\" concludes on a similar note:\n\nTen thousand pounds would I freely give\nTo know on earth, that my Franklin do live.\nWithin a short time, Dylan made the song a regular part of his repertoire, performing it for his first major New York concert at Town Hall on April 12, 1963.

The song originated with its opening riff, written by guitarist Bernard Butler who was inspired \"totally secretly\" by \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". According to Butler, he conceived this guitar part during rehearsal in early 1992 and presented it to singer Brett Anderson, who was slow to warm to it.\nThe title of the song is a reference to the inhalant drug amyl nitrite, although Anderson has said it has more to do with other drugs like ecstasy and cocaine. He came up with the song's lyrical theme after going through a period where he said \"drugs were taking the place of people.\" Chris Jones, reviewing Suede's debut album for the BBC, concurred: \"Despite its punning title it\u2019s a thrill-seeking slice of cynicism that perfectly summed up what it was like to be young and chemically imbalanced in the nation\u2019s capital at the time.\"The original working title for the song was \"Dixon\", as Butler's guitar part during the chorus was inspired by the intro to popular BBC television series Dixon of Dock Green. The song was almost overlooked as a single. Initially, Anderson was convinced that the ballad \"Sleeping Pills\" would be the third single, but he was overruled by Nude Records owner Saul Galpern who insisted that \"Nitrate\" had the broader commercial appeal. Speaking to NME in 2013 on writing the song, Anderson said: \"We were rehearsing it for months and months and Bernard kept asking me if I had any lyrics for it and I wanted something special to say over the top of what he\u2019s written. I like the fact it\u2019s a song about a dark, murky world that ended up in the Top 10.\" Indeed, Anderson had stated in the first Melody Maker cover story in April 1992 that his fantasy was to have written a top-10 UK single about \"some bizarre sexual experience.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53162", "text": "The song was first performed live six months before its actual release at the 1992 Reading Festival.

It would receive its largest audience when the band played the song at the 1993 Brit Awards one week prior to its release. When the NME heard that Suede had been left off the nominations for the Brit Awards, they began a weekly campaign to get them to perform at the awards on the night. The song was nominated for Best British Single at the following year's Brit Awards. The single was released in the UK on 22 February 1993 and became the band's first top-10 single, charting at No. 7 on the UK Singles Chart. The single remained at No. 7 the following week. At the time this was considered a rare feat for an indie band, something which Saul Galpern points to the Brits performance as the reason for its success. It is estimated the performance reached approximately nine million homes. While the song's subject matter may not have particularly appealed to the masses, Anderson agreed that it did reach a wide audience due to its hooks and radio friendly appeal.In continental Europe, the song was released on 1 March 1993. The single was the band's big breakthrough in Sweden, a country where the band would have long-term future success. Two weeks prior to the release of the single, Sony Music Sweden had ordered finished product directly from Nude Records and sent it to key radio producers, media and retailers. The promotion efforts paid off when \"Animal Nitrate\" became a big radio hit in Sweden and generated strong interest in the band's first Swedish gig.

The group comprised vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock.\nOriginally named the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, Led Zeppelin, was a top-ten album in several countries and featured such tracks as \"Good Times Bad Times\", \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Communication Breakdown\". Led Zeppelin II (1969) was their first number-one album, and yielded \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Ramble On\". In 1970, they released Led Zeppelin III which featured \"Immigrant Song\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history with 37 million copies sold. The album includes \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock history. Houses of the Holy (1973) yielded \"The Song Remains the Same\" and \"Over the Hills and Far Away\". Physical Graffiti (1975), a double album, featured \"The Rover\" and \"Kashmir\".\nPage composed most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones's keyboard-based compositions later became central to their music, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included Presence (1976) and In Through the Out Door (1979), grew limited, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death in 1980, feeling that they would not be \"Led Zeppelin\" without him. Since then, the surviving former members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off concerts. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham's son Jason Bonham on drums.\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time; their total record sales are estimated to be between 200 and 300 million units worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US Billboard 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

The influence of American blues artists such as Muddy Waters and Skip James was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct country blues style of Howlin' Wolf. Tracks were structured around the twelve-bar blues on every studio album except for one, and the blues directly and indirectly influenced other songs both musically and lyrically. The band were also strongly influenced by the music of the British, Celtic, and American folk revivals. Scottish folk guitarist Bert Jansch helped inspire Page, and from him he adapted open tunings and aggressive strokes into his playing. The band also drew on a wide variety of genres, including world music, and elements of early rock and roll, jazz, country, funk, soul, and reggae, particularly on Houses of the Holy and the albums that followed.The material on the first two albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of blues standards and folk songs. This method led to the mixing of musical and lyrical elements of different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, to create new material, but would lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright.  Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for the final version of the song. From the visit to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed. In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would then add lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts.\nEarly lyrics drew on the band's blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs. Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music. Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as misogynistic. Particularly on Led Zeppelin III, they incorporated elements of mythology and mysticism into their music, which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history. These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the occult, which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained subliminal satanic messages, some of which were said to be contained in backmasking; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics. The pastoral fantasies in Plant's songwriting were inspired by the landscape of the Black Country region and J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band's main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast counterculture of the 1960s. In the later part of the band's career Plant's lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences and circumstances.According to musicologist Robert Walser, \"Led Zeppelin's sound was marked by speed and power, unusual rhythmic patterns, contrasting terraced dynamics, singer Robert Plant's wailing vocals, and guitarist Jimmy Page's heavily distorted crunch\". These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the originators of hard rock and heavy metal and they have been described as the \"definitive heavy metal band\", although the band members have often eschewed the label.  Led Zeppelin, together with Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid- seventies\". Part of this reputation depends on the band's use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"The Wanton Song\". Often riffs were not doubled by guitar, bass and drums exactly, but instead there were melodic or rhythmic variations. Page's guitar playing incorporated elements of the blues scale with those of eastern music. Plant's use of high-pitched shrieks has been compared to Janis Joplin's vocal technique. Robert Christgau found him integral to the group's heavy \"power blues\" aesthetic, functioning as a \"mechanical effect\" similarly to Page's guitar parts. While noting Plant \"hints at real feeling\" on some of their acoustic songs, Christgau believed he abandoned traditional blues singing's emphasis on emotional projection in favour of vocal precision and dynamics: \"Whether he is mouthing sexist blues cliches or running through one of the band's half-audible, half-comprehensible ... lyrics about chivalry or the counter-culture, his voice is devoid of feeling. Like the tenors and baritones of yore, he wants his voice to be an instrument\u2014specifically, an electric guitar.\" Bonham's drumming was noted for its power, his rapid rolls and his fast beats on a single bass drum; while Jones' basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band's sound.\n\nLed Zeppelin have been widely viewed as a hard rock band, although Christgau regarded them as art rock as well. According to popular music scholar Reebee Garofalo, \"because hip critics could not find a constructive way of positioning themselves in relation to Led Zeppelin's ultra-macho presentation, they were excluded from the art rock category despite their broad range of influences.\" Christgau wrote in 1972, the band could be considered art rock because they \"relate to rock and roll not organically but intellectually\", idealising the \"amplified beat\" as \"a kind of formal challenge\". Unlike their contemporaries in Jethro Tull and Yes, who use \"the physical compulsion of beat and volume to involve the mind\", Led Zeppelin \"make body music of an oddly cerebral cast, arousing aggression rather than sexuality.\" As such, along with other second-generation English hard rock bands like Black Sabbath and Mott the Hoople, they can attract both intellectuals and working-class youths in \"a strange potential double audience.\" Years later, In Through the Out Door's \"tuneful synthesizer pomp\" further confirmed for Christgau they were an art rock band.Page stated that he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had \"light and shade\". This began to be more clearly realised beginning with Led Zeppelin III, which made greater use of acoustic instruments. This approach has been seen as exemplified in the fourth album, particularly on \"Stairway to Heaven\", which begins with acoustic guitar and recorder and ends with drums and heavy electric sounds. Towards the end of their recording career, they moved to a more mellow and progressive sound, dominated by Jones' keyboard motifs. They also increasingly made use of various layering and production techniques, including multi-tracking and overdubbed guitar parts. Their emphasis on the sense of dynamics and ensemble arrangement has been seen as producing an individualistic style that transcends any single music genre. Ian Peddie argues that they were \"... loud, powerful and often heavy, but their music was also humorous, self-reflective and extremely subtle\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53189", "text": "Many have considered Led Zeppelin to be one of the most successful, innovative, and influential bands in the history of rock music. Rock critic Mikal Gilmore said, \"Led Zeppelin\u2014talented, complex, grasping, beautiful and dangerous\u2014made one of the most enduring bodies of composition and performance in twentieth-century music, despite everything they had to overpower, including themselves\".Led Zeppelin have influenced hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush, Queen, Scorpions, Aerosmith, the Black Crowes, and Megadeth as well as progressive metal bands like Tool and Dream Theater. They influenced some early punk and post-punk bands, among them the Ramones, Joy Division and the Cult. They were also an important influence on the development of alternative rock, as bands adapted elements from the \"Zeppelin sound\" of the mid-1970s, including the Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Bands and artists from diverse genres have acknowledged the influence of Led Zeppelin, such as Madonna, Shakira, Lady Gaga, Kesha, and Katie Melua.\nLed Zeppelin have been credited with a major impact on the nature of the music business, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock. In 1988 John Kalodner, then-A&R executive of Geffen Records, remarked that\n\nIn my opinion, next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They're the ones who did the first real big arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can do as well as them, but nobody surpasses them.\nAndrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, commented on how Led Zeppelin had a major influence on the record business, and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences. In 2007, they were a featured artist in the stadium rock episode of the BBC/VH1 series Seven Ages of Rock.The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide according to some sources, while others state that they have sold in excess of 300 million records, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Led Zeppelin are the third-highest-selling band, the fifth highest selling music act in the US, and one of only four acts to earn five or more Diamond albums. They achieved eight consecutive number-ones on the UK Albums Chart, a record for most consecutive UK number-one albums shared with ABBA. Led Zeppelin remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music.Led Zeppelin also made a significant cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, argues that \"on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement\". Led Zeppelin have also been described as \"the quintessential purveyors\" of masculine and aggressive \"cock rock\", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that \"Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people want a piece of that\". Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the big hair of the 1980s glam metal bands such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Skid Row. Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman hair of Jack White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno's silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced tight jeans.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They were also a founding member of Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth occult group, and fronted the experimental pop rock band Psychic TV.\nBorn in Manchester, P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the avant-garde while at Solihull School. After dropping out of studies at the University of Hull, they moved into a counter-cultural commune in London and adopted Genesis P-Orridge as their pseudonym. On returning to Hull, they founded COUM Transmissions with Cosey Fanni Tutti, and in 1973 they relocated to London. COUM's confrontational performance work, dealing with such subjects as sex work, pornography, serial killers, and occultism, represented a concerted attempt to challenge societal norms and attracted the attention of the national press. COUM's 1976 Prostitution show at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts was particularly vilified by tabloids, gaining them the moniker of the \"wreckers of civilisation.\" P-Orridge's band, Throbbing Gristle, grew out of COUM, and were active from 1975 to 1981 as pioneers in the industrial music genre. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Psychic TV, an experimental band that from 1988 onward came under the increasing influence of acid house.\nIn 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, an informal occult order influenced by chaos magic and experimental music. P-Orridge was seen as the group's leader, but rejected that position, and left the group in 1991. Amid the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, a 1992 Channel 4 documentary accused P-Orridge of sexually abusing children, resulting in a police investigation. P-Orridge was subsequently cleared and Channel 4 retracted their allegation. As a result of the incident, P-Orridge left the United Kingdom for the United States and settled in New York City. There, they married Jacqueline Breyer, later known as Lady Jaye, in 1995, and together they embarked on the Pandrogeny Project, an attempt to unite as a \"pandrogyne\", or single entity, through the use of surgical body modification to physically resemble one another. P-Orridge continued with this project of body modification after Lady Jaye's 2007 death. Although involved in reunions of both Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV in the 2000s, they retired from music to focus on other artistic media in 2009.\nP-Orridge was credited on over 200 releases during their lifetime. They were cited as an icon within the avant-garde art scene, accrued a cult following, and had been given the moniker of the \"Godparent of Industrial Music\". P-Orridge considered themself third-gender and used various gender-neutral pronouns.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_53193", "text": "Throbbing Gristle was formed in late 1975 as a four-piece band, consisting of P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti, Peter \"Sleazy\" Christopherson and Chris Carter. The name \"Throbbing Gristle\" was adopted after a Northern English slang term for an erect penis. P-Orridge's involvement in Throbbing Gristle led to the artist being regularly cited as the \"Godfather of Industrial Music\", or in some later sources, \"godparent\".The first Throbbing Gristle performance was held at the Air Gallery in London in July 1976. At that point, Throbbing Gristle's headquarters was located at 10 Martello Street, Hackney, East London, the address of an artist collective. P-Orridge and Tutti's living and work space was the postal address of Industrial Records (IR). Throbbing Gristle released \"Discipline\" in 1980. TG came to be identified as the founders of industrial music, although at the same time the academic Drew Daniel asserted that as a result of its eclecticism, their music resists clear analysis.Throbbing Gristle's best-selling single was \"Zyklon B Zombie\" (1978), the title being a reference to the Zyklon B poison gas used at Auschwitz extermination camp. With their album 20 Jazz Funk Greats they attempted to move away from their industrial sound, and produced songs in a variety of different musical genres. P-Orridge received a number of threatening phone calls, proceeding to record them and use them as a backing track for the TG song \"Death Threats\".The final IR release was called Nothing Here Now But the Recordings, a best-of album taken from the archives of William S. Burroughs, who provided P-Orridge and Christopherson with access to his reel-to-reel tape archive.The final Throbbing Gristle live event, Mission of Dead Souls, occurred in May 1981 at the Kezar Pavilion in San Francisco. Shortly after the San Francisco event, P-Orridge and Paula Brooking were married.During this period, P-Orridge befriended an English musician named David Bunting; P-Orridge already knew another man named David, so coined the moniker David Tibet, which Bunting adopted as a stage name. Through an introduction provided by Burroughs, P-Orridge met Brion Gysin in Paris, probably in 1980, coming to be deeply influenced by Gysin's cut-up method; P-Orridge understood this to be a revolutionary method of escaping current patterns of thought and developing something new.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53194", "text": "Following the break-up of Throbbing Gristle, in 1981 P-Orridge founded a band with Peter Christopherson and Alex Fergusson that they named Psychic TV. Involved in video art, they also performed psychedelic, punk, electronic and experimental music. The decision to name the band \"Psychic TV\" stemmed from P-Orridge's belief that while mainstream television was a form of mass indoctrination and mind control, it could be used as an \"esoterrorist\" form of magick to combat the establishment's control. Historian Dave Evans described Psychic TV as \"a band dedicated to musical eclecticism and magical experiment, their performances being in part ritual (ab)use of sound samples, the creation of 'auditory magical sigils' and the destruction of consensus language in order to find meaning\".The band's first song, \"Just Drifting\", was based on a poem by P-Orridge. For their first album, Force the Hand of Chance (1982), P-Orridge used a kangling, or Tibetan trumpet made out of a human thigh-bone; the instrument had been introduced to P-Orridge by David Tibet, and attracted attention to their music. P-Orridge had become acquainted with Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan and ideologue of LaVeyan Satanism, with LaVey making an appearance on the Psychic TV song \"Joy\", in which he recites the Lord's Prayer backwards. From 1988, the band came under the increasing influence of the acid house genre of dance music, and were responsible for helping the popularisation of acid house music in Europe.Psychic TV made its debut in 1982 at an event organised by P-Orridge, David Dawson, and Roger Ely, called The Final Academy. It was a 4-day multimedia celebratory rally held in Manchester and at the Ritzy Cinema in Brixton, South London. It brought performers and audience together with literature, performance, film and music. PTV, Cabaret Voltaire, 23 Skidoo, Z'EV, John Giorno, William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Terry Wilson, Jeff Nuttall, and the Last Few Days participated to honour the cut-up techniques and theories of William S. Burroughs, Ian Sommerville, Antony Balch and Gysin. Video projection and early sampling were used here, as well as whispered utterances by P-Orridge reprocessed as a soundtrack to Gysin's Dreammachine by the Hafler Trio. In the mid-1980s, Psychic TV aimed to release a live album on the 23rd of each month for 23 months in recognition of the 23 enigma. The group did not reach its goal but still managed fourteen albums in eighteen months, thus earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. Following the culmination of Psychic TV but before embarking on Thee Majesty, P-Orridge and several Psychic TV musicians formed Splinter Test, a name adopted from one of P-Orridge's essays on sampling.In 1981, P-Orridge also founded a loosely organised network of occultists named Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY), with the aid of John Balance, Tibet, and a number of members of the Process Church of the Final Judgement, a group which had exerted an influence on P-Orridge's occult thought. TOPY was conceived not as an occult order of teaching, but a forum to facilitate discussions on occult ideas by like-minded people, and from its beginnings was understood by its founders to be a successor to the late 19th and early 20th century Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), especially as the latter had been run under Crowley's leadership. Evans described TOPY as \"a 'fusion' organisation, creating a crossover of punk/experimental music with chaos magical thinking and practice\", making particular use of the sigilisation practices of occult artist Austin Osman Spare. Journalist Gavin Baddeley described TOPY as \"perhaps the most influential new occult order of the 1980s\". P-Orridge had never wanted to be seen as the leader of an occult order, although many of those involved in TOPY were frustrated that outsiders regularly described P-Orridge as the group's leader. Accordingly, P-Orridge separated from TOPY in 1991, although it continued as a fan community after the departure.Having been encouraged by groups involved in propagating the moral panic about alleged Satanic ritual abuse, the Channel 4 1992 documentary show Dispatches claimed to have discovered videotapes depicting P-Orridge sexually abusing children in a ritual setting. Police from the Obscene Publications Squad subsequently raided P-Orridge's home, and confiscated several tonnes of art work. At the time, P-Orridge was in Thailand undertaking famine relief work; fearing arrest and loss of child custody upon return to the UK, P-Orridge stayed out of the country for several years, settling in the United States. P-Orridge believed that the negative press and police attention were the result of a campaign organised by a Christian group. It was subsequently revealed that the footage obtained did not depict child abuse. Instead, it was a video artwork titled First Transmissions that had been made in the early 1980s, partially funded by Channel 4 itself; the footage depicted sex-magic rites between adults, bloodletting performances, and scenes of the filmmaker Derek Jarman reading passages from the work of Geoffrey Chaucer.

The religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge characterised P-Orridge's work as being a \"confluence of pornography, violence, death, degradation, the confrontation of taboo subjects, noise and Paganism\", deliberately courting controversy and expressing an anti-establishment stance. Partridge suggested that this intent to shock emerged both out of a serious attempt to highlight the mechanisms of social control in Western society and also out of \"a juvenile delight gained from extreme behaviour and the offence caused\".P-Orridge's work was particularly influenced by the early 20th-century English artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare, who shared their disdain for mainstream morality and fascination with sexuality and the human body. P-Orridge adopted Spare's views on sigils, coming to see their own work as a form of sigil magic. Spare's sigilisation process entailed writing down one's desires, before crossing out any letters that are repeated and then combining the remaining letters into an abstract design, or sigil; the magician must then focus on that sigil and mentally absorb it, and \u2013 according to Spare's claims \u2013 psychic energies operating on the subconscious ensure that the original desire is manifested in reality. P-Orridge adopted this theory, believing that their work operates according to its principles.A further element of P-Orridge's work is their common use of idiosyncratic grammar and spelling, such as \"Thee\" in place of \"the\", \"ov\" in place of \"of\" and (especially in early writings) \"butter\" in place of \"but\".

Asserting that their \"industrial paganism\" was different from most forms of contemporary paganism, Partridge described it as \"confrontational, subversive, experimental and, to a large extent, dystopian\", with it serving as \"an ideological tool\" with which to analyse society \"from its underbelly; an immersion in the dark side; the subversion of Christian hegemony, conservative politics and what nowadays might be described as neoliberalism\". P-Orridge was devoted to the deity Eshu Eleggu\u00e1, an entity from the Afro-Caribbean syncretic religion of Santer\u00eda. P-Orridge also stated disbelief in the literal existence of gods, deeming such entities to instead be \"early attempts at psychology, trying to understand the light and dark side of human nature\".P-Orridge vociferously criticised contemporary Christianity, describing it as \"an incredibly sick social pseudo-religion\", and arguing that it was based upon the tenet of \"Be good now, agree, or else we will punish you forever and ever when you're dead. And we may punish you while you're alive ...\"  P-Orridge maintained that such an attitude was established in Christianity by St. Paul and the early Roman Catholic Church, and that it differed from the \"ecstatic mysticism of the original Christianity, the Gnostic Christianity\".In her memoir, Art Sex Music, former bandmate Cosey Fanni Tutti claimed P-Orridge had been abusive during their relationship.

On late 1985, Madonna and Leonard began working on her third studio album; she also enlisted the help of former boyfriend Stephen Bray, with whom she had worked on her previous record Like a Virgin (1984). Titled True Blue, the record saw Madonna co-writing and co-producing for the first time in her career. It is a dance-pop album that features influences of Motown sound, girl groups, and Latin pop. It was inspired by Madonna's love for Penn, to whom she dedicated the album.\nUpon release, the album was well received by critics, who complimented Madonna's vocals and musical growth. It was an immediate global success, reaching number one in a record-breaking 28 countries across the world. With over 25 million copies sold worldwide, True Blue is the best-selling album of 1986, the best-selling of the 1980s by a female artist, and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Five singles were released from the album \u2015all reached the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, with three going to number one. The album was promoted on Madonna's second concert tour, 1987's Who's That Girl World Tour, which visited cities in Asia, North America, and Europe. True Blue is credited as the album that established Madonna's position as the biggest female artist of the 1980s, rivaling male musicians like Michael Jackson and Prince. It's also considered the album that made her an icon and artist.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_53205", "text": "In February 1985, Madonna began dating actor Sean Penn, whom she met in the set of the music video for her single \"Material Girl\". She recalled that Penn was someone \"whose work I\u2019d admired, and I think he felt the same way [...] We have so much in common he is almost like my brother\". They dated casually and married six months later, on Madonna's 27th birthday. Afterwards, the newlyweds starred together in a movie called Shanghai Surprise (1986), which was a critical and commercial failure.Madonna met producer Patrick Leonard while on the Virgin Tour, where he was hired as musical director. After the tour was finished, Madonna asked Leonard if he wanted to work with her. They met at a barbecue in his house, where he showed her a song he'd created in his studio called \"Love Makes the World Go Round\", which Madonna sang at the Philadelphia Live Aid benefit concert on July 13, 1985. Leonard and Madonna's next collaboration was a song called \"Live to Tell\", which was conceived as an instrumental for the score of Paramount's film Fire with Fire. Paramount, however, rejected the track; Leonard then asked Madonna as a favor, if she would write the lyrics.  She complied, and decided to use the track on At Close Range, a movie starring Penn.On April 5, 1986, Billboard reported that Madonna's new album would be called Live to Tell, and be released in the summer. One month later, the title was confirmed to be True Blue, named after a favorite expression Penn's. She wanted to reach a wider, more mature audience with the album, which she described as her \"most personal\" at the time. Pleased with the results of \"Live to Tell\", she chose to keep Leonard on the project, and also enlisted former boyfriend Stephen Bray, with whom she had worked on her second album Like a Virgin (1984), and felt could help her create \"up-tempo songs with a classic Top 40 sensibility\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53206", "text": "Recording for True Blue took place from December 1985 to April 1986, during the first year of Madonna and Penn's marriage, at the Channel Recording Studios in Los Angeles. For the first time in her career, Madonna co-wrote and co-produced all of the album's tracks. According to Leonard, she was \"very much in love\" and in control when creating the record. The singer worked with Bray and Leonard separately, with the three meeting together only once. Leonard recalled the recording process: \"I would put something together, usually just on piano, and then [Madonna] would come in, we'd mess around with whatever needed to be messed around with, she\u2019d write a lyric, she\u2019d sing it, and the next day we would do another song, one a day\". On the other hand, Bray's job was to \"shape things and [...] create arrangements to show off the song[s] better\".  \"Open Your Heart\" was the first track recorded for the album; it was created as a rock and roll song titled \"Follow Your Heart\" by Gardner Cole and Peter Rafelson for singer Cyndi Lauper. Madonna's team got a demo with songs from Cole's management, among them \"Follow Your Heart\"; she liked the track, changed the title, re-wrote some of the lyrics, and produced it alongside Leonard. They added a bassline underneath, changing it from a rock song into a dance one.\"Papa Don't Preach\" was written by Brian Elliott for a singer named Cristina Dent. When Elliot played Dent's tracks for Warner's Michael Ostin, the same A&R executive who discovered \"Like a Virgin\", Ostin asked if he could play the track for Madonna; Elliot had been working with Dent for six months and was reluctant to let the song go to another artist, but he eventually gave in, finding the idea of Madonna recording his song \"hard to resist\". With lyrics that talk about teenage pregnancy, Madonna was attracted to the track because it \"fit right in with my own personal zeitgeist of standing up to male authorities\". She only contributed with additional lyrics, making \"Papa Don't Preach\" the only song on the album that she did not have a strong hand in writing. \"La Isla Bonita\" marked a \"stylistic shift\" for Madonna, as it's her first song to incorporate Latin motifs, and lyrics in Spanish.  It was created by Leonard as an instrumental and offered to Michael Jackson, who turned it down. After meeting with the singer to start working on True Blue, Leonard presented her the demo and she wrote the lyrics while filming Shanghai Surprise. To get the correct translations, he and Madonna talked over the phone with a Hispanic housekeeper. It was described as a tribute to \"the beauty and mystery of Latin American people\". \"Where's the Party\" is the only track that saw Madonna, Bray and Leonard working together. Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens-Crowder, the authors of Madonna's 1983 hit \"Holiday\", wrote a song called \"Spotlight\" for the album, that was recorded but ultimately not included. Madonna dedicated True Blue to Penn, \"the coolest guy in the universe\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53207", "text": "Daryl Easlea, author of Madonna: Blond Ambition, described True Blue as a \"girlish\" album, \"the sound of a woman in love\". Made up of \"highly commercial dance-pop [with] lyrics [that] convey an upbeat message along with casual autobiographical references\", it contains musical references to Motown sound and girl groups. Her love for Penn \"seep[s] into every song\", as noted by author Lucy O'Brien. Adam Sexton pointed out that, \"[Madonna] transforms her own marital bliss into high-school accessible scenarios of a girl breaking down a bad boy's defense\". Opener \"Papa Don't Preach\" is a dance post-disco track, with lyrics that see a daughter telling her father she is pregnant and refuses to have an abortion or give up the baby for adoption, despite her friends' advice. The strings in the introduction nod to classical and Baroque music. The following track, \"Open Your Heart\", is a \"simple\" \"dizzy, driving\" dance-pop love song \"brimming with sexual innuendo\". Lyrically, it is a \"tale of an unrequited love for someone seen on the street\", and begins with Madonna whispering watch out! just as the opening drums kick in.Third track \"White Heat\" was dedicated to actor James Cagney and named after the 1949 film of the same name. It is a \"standard\" uptempo dance track, with synth bass and doubletracked vocals; also present are two quotes from the original soundtrack, \"with speech and gunshots\", one at the beginning and one towards the end. \"Live to Tell\" is a pop ballad whose background instrumentation features a keyboard, a synthesizer, electric guitar and a mix of synthesized and real drumming. Lyrically, it talks about the complexity of deceit, mistrust, and \"bearing the burden of some enigmatic secret and coping with a painful past\". Fifth track \"Where's the Party\" is a dance song described by Madonna herself as a statement about \"what it's like to be in the middle of this press stuff with everybody on my back\". Inspired by Motown and girl groups from the 1960s, title track \"True Blue\" is Madonna's tribute to Penn. The verse-and-chorus composition is reminiscent of that of The Dixie Cups' \"Chapel of Love\" (1964), with backup singers Siedah Garrett and Edie Lehman accompanying Madonna's convincing \"girly\" vocals like a choir.\"La Isla Bonita\" combines flamenco guitar, Latin percussion, electronic sounds, and maracas. Lyrically, it talks about a \"humble observer, captured by the rhythm of an imagined island\" named San Pedro, with mentions of \"tropical breeze\" and \"nature wild and free\". It starts with an introduction performed on bongos, before descending into castanets. Madonna then utters the phrase \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede ser verdad? (\"How can it be true?\"). In one line, she specifically sings, Last night I dreamt of San Pedro/Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song. One of the album's \"happiest\" cuts is \"Jimmy Jimmy\", which has influences of New wave music. In the lyrics, Madonna commemorates her \"youthful fascination\" with actor James Dean; \"I used to fantasize that we grew up in the same neighbourhood and that he moved away and became a big star\", she recalled. Closer \"Love Makes the World Go Round\" incorporates Latin drums and samba-influenced rhythms, and lyrics that talk about anti-war and anti-poverty.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53208", "text": "The album cover was shot by photographer Herb Ritts. It shows Madonna in profile, with her head thrown back and eyes closed against a sky-blue background; her skin is bleached-out, and her hair platinum blonde. Jeri Heiden, who was working at the Warner Bros. art department, was given the task of editing the photos to make them usable as album covers. The final photo was selected by Madonna, Heiden and Jeff Ayeroff, creative director of Warner Bros. at that time. After the image was chosen, Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the original, which was shot in black and white, to go along with the album's title, and finally arrived at the final, blue toned, hand tinted version. The album's inner sleeve did not feature any photographs, and instead was dedicated to album credits and song lyrics, since Madonna wanted to be represented by her work rather than her image.Lucy O'Brien described the cover as a \"moment of Warholian pop art. A mixture of innocence [and] idealism [...] Our first glimpse of Madonna as a classic icon\". For J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of Madonna: An Intimate Biography, the artwork  indicated how \"[True Blue] was a vehicle of growth for [Madonna]\"; the \"washed out color photograph\" cover was \"understated\", especially when compared to the \"sexier poses\" she had been associated with in the past. For Joe Lynch from Billboard, it's one of the greatest album covers of all time.True Blue was released on June 30, 1986. In the United States and Canada, the cover did not include the singer's name. Heiden explained in an interview with Aperture magazine that the record company thought it would be \"cool\" to use a shrink wrap on the American releases, so that when the public took it off, they'd be left with the photograph of Madonna. In Europe, Warner felt that the name was needed, as they did not want to risk messing with Madonna's popularity. The back sleeve and booklet feature the song titles in Heiden's own handwriting. About cropping the image for the cassette and vinyl releases, Heiden said: \"I think the image became more interesting cropped into a square\u2014and at that time we always started with the album cover configuration. It was like she was floating\u2014her clothing was not visible. She took on the appearance of a marble statue\u2014Goddess like. In the vertical cropping you see her leather jacket and the wall, and it becomes more typical, editorial, earthly\".

He began writing the album on early morning bike rides, compiling lines in a notebook for an album that was intended to be about how he had given up. Although it seemed the members of the band had been beaten into misery in their early 20s, Campbell, after riding past a fountain at \"Logan Circle\" and seeing it had been switched on, realized it wasn't right for him to feel defeated at 23. After a month of writing with the band living in his home, they emerged with a newly adopted \"we're not sad anymore\" philosophy.\n\nWhilst the lyrics have been referred to as \"more personal than ever,\" the band didn't shy away from the humor on their previous releases, with topics about sexting (referring to a member of I Call Fives), cock-blocking, and fist pumping. The lyrics also venture into different themes in each song, from the loneliness of tour life (\"Everything I Own Fits in this Backpack\"), to social awkwardness (\"This Party Sucks\") and persevering through bad times (\"Washington Square Park\"). Allmusic's review said The Upsides has a concept album-like feel and is filled with \"post-college angst, busted hearts, big questions, hope, anger, humor, and life\", adding that the songs fit together like an intricate puzzle, flowing like it was an entire diary's worth of observations, feelings and events.Campbell said \"when the record came out, I was not in the best spot.\" He had broken up with his girlfriend of two years but still felt \"the prevailing theme kind of worked because while I was kind of down at the moment; it was a different down than I had been before. Like in the past, I\u2019ve been depressed, and just kind of been complacent, and okay with it, but this was a different sad.

He is also the founder and CEO of P. Miller Enterprises and Better Black Television, which was a short-lived online television network. Miller gained fame in the mid-1990s with the success of his hip hop group TRU as well as his fifth solo rap album Ice Cream Man (1996), which contained his first single \"Mr. Ice Cream Man\". Miller's  popularity grew in 1997 after the success of his Platinum single \"Make 'Em Say Uhh!\".

Washington High School and Warren Easton High School. Having played on the basketball team, Miller attended the University of Houston on an athletic scholarship, but dropped out months into his freshman year and transferred to Merritt College in Oakland, California to major in business administration. After the death of his grandfather, Miller inherited $10,000 as part of a malpractice settlement. Miller opened a record store in Richmond, California called No Limit Records And Tapes, which later became the foundation for No Limit Records. On February 15, 1990, Master P released the cassette tape Mind Of A Psychopath. His brother Kevin Miller was killed that same year in New Orleans. This increased his motivation to become a successful entrepreneur to change his life and save his family.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53240", "text": "Aside from being a rapper, Master P has enjoyed a successful career as an entrepreneur and investor. Miller opened a record store in Richmond, California called No Limit Records, which later became the foundation for his own record label of the same name.Miller was one of the first rappers to notice and take advantage of the retail potential of the music industry. As an investor, Master P was one of the first rappers to build a business and financial empire by investing in a wide range of business and investment ventures from a variety of industries. He has since invested the millions of dollars he made from his No Limit record company into a travel agency, a Foot Locker retail outlet, real estate, stocks, film, music, and television production, toy making, clothing, telecommunications, a jewellery line, auto accessories, book and magazine publishing, car rims, fast food franchises, and gas stations. His sports management agency No Limit Communications, a joint venture with marketing guru Djuan Edgerton, was a success. His conglomerate company, No Limit Enterprises became a financial powerhouse. His real estate investment and property management company, the New Orleans-based PM Properties controls over 100 properties across the United States. According to Black Enterprise magazine, No Limit Enterprises grossed $110 million in revenue in 1998 alone. This level of success inspired other rappers to branch out into other business ventures and investments. Miller also has his own line of beverages called \"Make 'Em Say Ughh!\" energy drinks. Miller has also made a foray into mass media, where he founded Better Black Television, a cable television network in November 2010 based in New Orleans, making him the first rapper to establish a cable television network.Rappers had historically focused more on the artistic and glamorous side of hip hop music while paying very little attention to the business, investment, and financial aspects. All that changed in 1996 when Master P signed a music distribution deal with Priority Records, one where No Limit Records would retain 100% ownership of their master recordings and keep 85% of their record's sales while giving Priority 15% in return for pressing and distribution which allows No Limit to profit from future sales such as catalogs and reissues. Master P went on to make hundreds of millions of dollars from this deal. Additionally, Master P invented many innovative marketing techniques. According to Wendy Day, CEO of the Rap Coalition, \"Master P had a whole marketing movement. He was the first person to market the way a corporate entity like IBM would market to their clientele.\" Whereas the traditional model for marketing records was to spend millions of dollars on expensive videos and air play, Miller did not have such a luxury. As an independent artist, Miller had to find a way to sell, market and build platinum record selling demand on a limited recording budget. He was known for keeping upfront business expenses down and profit margins high. He began selling tapes out the trunk of his car in every city and town in America where there was potential demand for his music. He gave out free samples to people with expensive cars and had them playing his music throughout their neighborhoods. This street level guerrilla marketing technique set the foundation to build a larger fanbase for the future. After signing his deal with Priority, Miller began a high volume business model of cranking out as many records as possible, as frequently as possible. He branded all his albums, so that the No Limit brand became more important than the actual artist's name. Miller cross-promoted all his artists and albums inside the album covers. He also used pen and pixel graphics and Mafia-inspired themes to make his albums stand out using Photoshop. He offered 20 songs per album, whereas most albums offered 15 or less, as Miller learned that customers wanted more for their money. He turned his artists into Marvel comic book-like characters rather than just rappers. He made sure his artists were number one on SoundScan every time they released an album, to build the perception of popularity. He used inexpensive videos to promote his artists and he cross-promoted albums using films and vice versa and tied them altogether as a package. Brand image and identity became more important than just music quality. Miller's record labels have sold 75 million records as a result of his innovative marketing and branding strategies.As founder and CEO of No Limit Entertainment, Miller at one time presided over a business empire that included his conglomerate No Limit Enterprises, No Limit Records, Bout It Inc., No Limit Clothing, No Limit Communications, No Limit Films, No Limit Sports Management, P. M. Properties, and Advantage Travel. Miller represented former NFL running back Ricky Williams when he was drafted by the New Orleans Saints; however, the deal was rated the worst contract for a player in NFL History by ESPN. Miller manages the music, film, and television career of his son, Romeo Miller, as well as pop star Forrest Lipton and Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane.

His father worked as a truck driver and also played trumpet and sang in local bands. Freddy grew up listening to the rhythm and blues music of Big Joe Turner, Buddy Johnson and others on the radio, and he learned to play guitar.  After attending Lynn Vocation High School, he made his recording debut as a singer in 1958, singing and playing rhythm guitar on a single, \"Cha-Cha-Do\" by the Spindrifts, which became a local hit.  He had also played lead guitar on a session for an R&B vocal group, the G-Clefs, whose record \"Ka-Ding Dong\" made No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1956. At a young age he joined the National Guard, took a job driving a truck, married, and became a father.Inspired musically by Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little Richard, he formed his own group, Freddy Karmon & the Hurricanes, which became increasingly popular in the Boston area, and began to develop a trademark strained singing style.  He also became a regular on a local TV dance show, Boston Ballroom, and, in 1958, signed up to a management contract with Boston disc jockey Jack McDermott.  With lyrics written by his mother, he prepared a new song which he called \"Rock and Roll Baby\", and he produced a demo which McDermott took to the writing and production team of Bob Crewe and Frank Slay.  They rearranged the song, rewrote the lyrics, and offered to produce a recording in return for two-thirds of the composing credits. The first recording of the song, now titled \"Tallahassee Lassie\", with a guitar solo by session musician Kenny Paulson, was rejected by several record companies, but was then heard by TV presenter Dick Clark who part-owned Swan Records in Philadelphia. \nClark suggested that the song be re-edited and overdubbed to add excitement, by highlighting the pounding bass drum sound and adding hand claps and Freddy's cries of \"whoo!\", which later became one of his trademarks. The single was finally released by Swan Records, with the company president, Bernie Binnick, suggesting Freddy's new stage name of \"Freddy Cannon\". After being promoted and becoming successful in Boston and Philadelphia, the single gradually received national airplay.  In 1959, it peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first of his 22 songs to appear on the Billboard chart, and also reached No. 13 on the R&B singles chart. In the UK, where his early records were issued on the Top Rank label, it reached No. 17. \"Tallahassee Lassie\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.\nHe stayed on the Swan label with producer Frank Slay for the next five years and became known as Freddy \"Boom Boom\" Cannon for the thumping power of his recordings.

Freddy Cannon made rock & roll records; great noisy rock & roll records, and all of them were infused with a gigantic drum beat that was an automatic invitation to shake it on down anyplace there was a spot to dance.\"\nHis second single \"Okefenokee\" (credited to Freddie Cannon, as were several of his other records) only made No. 43 on the charts, but the next record, \"Way Down Yonder In New Orleans\", a rocked-up version of a 1922 song, became a gold record and reached No. 3 in the pop charts in both the US and the UK, where it was the biggest of his hits. It also sold over one million copies.  Cannon toured in Britain and, in March 1960, his album The Explosive Freddy Cannon became the first album by a rock and roll singer to top the UK Albums Chart. For the next two years, until early 1962, he continued to have lesser chart hits in the US, in some cases with versions of old standards including \"Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy\" and Edward \"Kid\" Ory's \"Muskrat Ramble\".  His hits also included \"Twistin' All Night Long\", recorded with Danny & the Juniors and also featuring Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons on backing vocals. However, one of his biggest hits came in May 1962 with \"Palisades Park\", written by future TV Gong Show host Chuck Barris. Produced by Slay with overdubbed rollercoaster sound effects, it reached No. 3 on the Hot 100, No. 15 on the R&B chart, and No. 20 in the UK. This release also sold over one million copies, gaining gold disc status.Cannon also appeared with Bobby Vee, Johnny Tillotson and others, in the movie Just for Fun, made in the UK in 1962.  Although his popularity in the US faded, he remained a popular touring act in Britain and elsewhere in the world for some years.  In 1963, he signed for Warner Bros. Records where he recorded his last two US top twenty hits, \"Abigail Beecher\" (No. 16) in 1964 and the following year \"Action\" (No. 13), from Dick Clark's TV show Where the Action Is, which he recorded with top Los Angeles session musicians including Leon Russell, James Burton, Glen Campbell, and David Gates. \"Action\" got a fourth gold disc for Cannon. Also in 1965, Slay acquired Cannon's Swan recordings and sold them to Warner Bros.\nHe appeared, along with the Beau Brummels, in Village of the Giants, a teen movie with early film appearances by Beau Bridges and Ron Howard, and played himself, performing one of his songs, in the final episode of the teen soap opera, Never Too Young, on 24 June 1966. \nAfter leaving Warner Bros. Records in 1967, Cannon released singles on several labels, including Sire, Royal American, Metromedia, MCA, Andee, Claridge, Horn, and Amherst. In the 1970s he recorded and became a promotional man for Buddah Records, but returned to the lower reaches of the charts in 1981 with \"Let's Put the Fun Back in Rock'n'Roll,\" recorded with the Belmonts for MiaSound Records and in 1982 appeared in the independent movie, The Junkman.  Thereafter, he continued to work with Dick Clark at his Bandstand reunion concerts and to tour all over the world.  In 2002, he released an album of seasonal songs, Have A Boom Boom Christmas!!A resident of Tarzana, California, Cannon continues to put on performances at assorted concert venues. He has complete control and ownership of his Swan and Warner Bros. masters.One notable fan of Cannon's was the late Box Tops and Big Star singer Alex Chilton; Chilton reportedly had a portrait of Cannon hanging on the wall of his home in New Orleans and had once offered the following comment about Cannon to a friend: \"Freddy Cannon\u2019s shows always worked, because he moved through life with ease.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In a major transition from his earlier sound, it was Dylan's first album to incorporate electric instrumentation, which caused controversy and divided many in the contemporary folk scene.The album is split into two distinct halves; the first half of the album features electric instrumentation, in which on side one of the original LP, Dylan is backed by an electric rock and roll band. The second half features mainly acoustic songs. The album abandons the protest music of Dylan's previous records in favor of more surreal, complex lyrics.The album reached No. 6 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart, the first of Dylan's LPs to break into the US Top 10. It also topped the UK charts later that spring. The first track, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", became Dylan's first single to chart in the US, peaking at No. 39. Bringing It All Back Home has been described as one of the greatest albums of all time by multiple publications. In 2003, it was ranked number 31 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", later repositioned to number 181 in the 2020 edition.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_53301", "text": "Dylan spent much of the summer of 1964 in Woodstock, a small town in upstate New York where his manager, Albert Grossman, had a place. When Joan Baez went to see Dylan that August, they stayed at Grossman's house. Baez recalls that \"most of the month or so we were there, Bob stood at the typewriter in the corner of his room, drinking red wine and smoking and tapping away relentlessly for hours. And in the dead of night, he would wake up, grunt, grab a cigarette, and stumble over to the typewriter again.\" Dylan already had one song ready for his next album: \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" was written in February 1964 but omitted from Another Side of Bob Dylan. Another song, \"Gates of Eden\", was also written earlier that year, appearing in the original manuscripts to Another Side of Bob Dylan; a few lyrical changes were eventually made, but it's unclear if these were made that August in Woodstock. At least two songs were written that month: \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\" and \"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\". During this time, Dylan's lyrics became increasingly surreal, and his prose grew more stylistic, often resembling stream-of-consciousness writing with published letters dating from 1964 becoming increasingly intense and dreamlike as the year wore on.\nDylan returned to the city, and on August 28, he met the Beatles for the first time in their New York hotel. In retrospect, this meeting with the Beatles would prove to be influential to the direction of Dylan's music, as he would soon record music invoking a rock sound for at least the next three albums. Dylan would remain on good terms with the Beatles, and as biographer Clinton Heylin writes, \"the evening established a personal dimension to the very real rivalry that would endure for the remainder of a momentous decade.\"\nDylan and producer Tom Wilson were soon experimenting with their own fusion of rock and folk music. The first unsuccessful test involved overdubbing a \"Fats Domino early rock & roll thing\" over Dylan's earlier, acoustic recording of \"House of the Rising Sun\", according to Wilson. This took place in the Columbia 30th Street Studio in December 1964. It was quickly discarded, though Wilson would more famously use the same technique of overdubbing an electric backing track to an existing acoustic recording with Simon & Garfunkel's \"The Sound of Silence\". In the meantime, Dylan turned his attention to another folk-rock experiment conducted by John P. Hammond, an old friend and musician whose father, John H. Hammond, originally signed Dylan to Columbia. Hammond was planning an electric album around the blues songs that framed his acoustic live performances of the time. To do this, he recruited three members of an American/Canadian bar band he met sometime in 1963: guitarist Robbie Robertson, drummer Levon Helm, and organist Garth Hudson (members of the Hawks, who would go on to become the Band). Dylan was very aware of the resulting album, So Many Roads; according to his friend, Danny Kalb, \"Bob was really excited about what John Hammond was doing with electric blues. I talked to him in the Figaro in 1964 and he was telling me about John and his going to Chicago and playing with a band and so on \u2026\"However, when Dylan and Wilson began work on the next album, they temporarily refrained from their own electric experimentation. The first session, held on January 13, 1965, in Columbia's Studio A in New York, was recorded solo, with Dylan playing piano or acoustic guitar. Ten complete songs and several song sketches were produced, nearly all of which were discarded. Take one of \"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\" would be used for the album, but three would eventually be released: \"I'll Keep It With Mine\" on 1985's Biograph, and \"Farewell Angelina\" and an acoustic version of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" on 1991's The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991.\nOther songs and sketches recorded at this session: \"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\", \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\", \"She Belongs to Me\", \"On the Road Again\", \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\", \"You Don't Have to Do That\", \"California,\" and \"Outlaw Blues\", all of which were original compositions.\nDylan and Wilson held another session at Studio A the following day, this time with a full, electric band. Guitarists Al Gorgoni, Kenny Rankin, and Bruce Langhorne were recruited, as were pianist Paul Griffin, bassists Joseph Macho Jr. and William E. Lee, and drummer Bobby Gregg. The day's work focused on eight songs, all of which had been attempted the previous day. According to Langhorne, there was no rehearsal, \"we just did first takes and I remember that, for what it was, it was amazingly intuitive and successful.\" Few takes were required of each song, and after three and a half hours of recording (lasting from 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm), master takes of \"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\", \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", \"Outlaw Blues\", \"She Belongs to Me\", and \"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\" were all recorded and selected for the final album.Sometime after dinner, Dylan reportedly continued recording with a different set of musicians, including John P. Hammond and John Sebastian (only Langhorne returned from earlier that day). They recorded six songs, but the results were deemed unsatisfactory and ultimately rejected.\n\nAnother session was held at Studio A the next day, and it would be the last one needed. Once again, Dylan kept at his disposal the musicians from the previous day (that is, those that participated in the 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm session); the one exception was pianist Paul Griffin, who was unable to attend and replaced by Frank Owens. Daniel Kramer recalls: The musicians were enthusiastic. They conferred with one another to work out the problems as they arose. Dylan bounced around from one man to another, explaining what he wanted, often showing them on the piano what was needed until, like a giant puzzle, the pieces would fit and the picture emerged whole \u2026 Most of the songs went down easily and needed only three or four takes \u2026 In some cases, the first take sounded completely different from the final one because the material was played at a different tempo, perhaps, or a different chord was chosen, or solos may have been rearranged...His method of working, the certainty of what he wanted, kept things moving.\nThe session began with \"Maggie's Farm\": only one take was recorded, and it was the only one they'd ever need. From there, Dylan successfully recorded master takes of \"On the Road Again\", \"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\", \"Gates of Eden\", \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", and \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\", all of which were set aside for the album. A master take of \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\" was also selected, but it would not be included on the album; instead, it was issued as a single-only release in Europe, but not in the US or the UK.\nThough Dylan was able to record electric versions of virtually every song included on the final album, he apparently never intended Bringing It All Back Home to be completely electric. As a result, roughly half of the finished album would feature full electric band arrangements while the other half consisted of solo acoustic performances, sometimes accompanied by Langhorne, who would embellish Dylan's acoustic performance with a countermelody on his electric guitar.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53302", "text": "The album's cover,  photographed by Daniel Kramer with an edge-softened lens, features Sally Grossman (wife of Dylan's manager Albert Grossman) lounging in the background.

It's been an emotional rollercoaster these last two years, whether it be divorce, sex, drink, drugs, arguments, whatever it might be, I can only write about what I'm experiencing. Life is about making mistakes and learning from them, learning about yourself and becoming a better person. That's what the title of the album basically means.\"\nThe opening song, \"Help Me (She's Out of Her Mind)\", has been described as \"easy funk\", and comparisons were drawn between Jones' vocals on the song and John Lennon's \"Cold Turkey\" vocals. Jason MacNeil of PopMatters compared the \"moody, murky blues rock\" song to Southern soul, while describing \"Maybe Tomorrow\" as \"English soul.\" Lead single \"Madame Helga\" has been described as gospel and glam metal, with \"dirty guitars duplicating a funky brass section.\" The acoustic, country-styled \"Climbing the Wall\" features horn and string sections and a Southern rock guitar solo, while the \"pseudo-experimentalism\" of \"I'm Alright (You Gotta Go There To Come Back)\" features looped drums and a piano.

They changed their names: Miller became Tom Verlaine, after the Symbolist Paul Verlaine, and Meyers became Richard Hell. The group was the first rock band to play the club CBGB, which soon became a breeding ground for the early punk rock scene in New York. Hell had an energetic stage presence and wore torn clothing held together with safety pins and spiked his hair; in 1975, after a failed management deal with the New York Dolls, impresario Malcolm McLaren brought some of Hell's ideas back with him to England and eventually incorporated them into the Sex Pistols' image.Disputes with Verlaine led to Hell's departure from Television in April 1975, and he co-founded the Heartbreakers with New York Dolls guitarist Johnny Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan. Hell lasted less than a year with this band, and began recruiting members for a new one in early 1976. For guitarists, Hell found Robert Quine and Ivan Julian\u2014Quine had worked in a bookstore with Hell, and Julian responded to an advertisement in The Village Voice.  They lifted drummer Marc Bell from Wayne County. The band was named the Voidoids after a novel Hell had been writing.Hell drew musical inspiration from acts such as Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, the Stooges and fellow New Yorkers the Velvet Underground, a group with a reputation for heroin-fueled rock and roll with poetic lyrics. Hell also drew from\u2014and covered\u2014garage rock bands such as the Seeds and the Count Five, both found on the 1972 Nuggets compilation.Hell had written the song \"Blank Generation\" while still in Television; he had played it regularly with the band since at least 1974, and later with the Heartbreakers. The Voidoids released a 7\" Blank Generation EP in November 1976 on Ork Records containing \"Blank Generation\", \"Another World\" and \"You Gotta Lose\". The cover featured a black-and-white photo by Hell's former girlfriend and unofficial CBGB photographer Roberta Bayley, depicting a bare-chested Hell with an open jeans zipper.

Two months later, they were informed that the album release would be delayed until September because their label, Sire Records, was changing distributors. \"In the meantime, I had noticed a lot of things about the record that I thought we could have done better,\" recalls Hell. He asked their label if they could re-record the album, and after getting their approval, they booked three weeks in late June and early July at Plaza Sound Studio, located on the eighth floor of Radio City Music Hall. The final LP would use the Plaza Sound recordings for every song except \"Liars Beware,\" \"New Pleasure\" and \"Another World,\" where the Electric Lady recordings were retained.

It was the band's first album with bassist Karl Alvarez and guitarist Stephen Egerton, who brought new songwriting ideas to the group. The album is titled after the concept of \"All\" invented by drummer Bill Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion in 1980. Based on the goals of achieving \"the total extent\" and \"to not settle for some, to always go for All\", the philosophy was the subject of the one-second title track, the two-second \"No, All!\", and \"All-O-Gistics\".\nAll marked the end of the Descendents' original run. Following two tours of the United States to promote the album, singer Milo Aukerman left the group to pursue a career in biochemistry.

Seeking a new bassist, drummer Bill Stevenson contacted a musician he knew in Boise, Idaho. The musician declined but suggested Salt Lake City native Karl Alvarez, whose band the Bad Yodelers was staying with him at the time while on tour. Stevenson had met Alvarez in 1984 while touring with Black Flag, and invited him to try out with the Descendents. Packing all his belongings in a garbage bag, Alvarez took a train from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles and began rehearsing with Stevenson. According to singer Milo Aukerman, Alvarez and Stevenson \"just locked in completely.\" \"I think Billy and I had a certain connection,\" recalled Alvarez, \"but I can't help but think 'Well, yeah, because I practiced bass to his records.'\"Guitarist Stephen Egerton called to congratulate Alvarez on joining the Descendents; the two had been friends since 1976, learned to play guitar together, had played in the Salt Lake City hardcore punk band Massacre Guys, and were both big Descendents fans. Knowing the band needed a guitarist, Alvarez recommended Egerton, who was living in Washington, D.C. at the time. Stevenson also knew Egerton through touring; Egerton had been a tour promoter for Black Flag and the Minutemen when they had played Salt Lake City in 1984. Egerton came to Los Angeles and practiced with the band for a few days, officially joining on Stevenson's birthday of September 10. After settling his affairs in Washington, D.C., he moved to Los Angeles that October. He and Alvarez moved into the Descendents' headquarters, a storefront along the Pacific Coast Highway in Lomita, California that housed the band's living quarters, practice space, and office. Egerton later recalled:\n\nFor me, meeting Bill, beyond my massive love for the Descendents' music, was my massive love for Black Flag's music, and he had been in both. So the idea that it was Karl, my oldest friend, and I joining this band that was so huge to us, it was like living on a cloud. We were like \"Uh, what just happened? Uh, we just joined the Descendents. This is gnarly.\"\nAfter practicing for a few weeks, the Descendents headed out on the second Enjoy! tour from late November 1986 to mid-January 1987, playing small shows for little money and sleeping on people's floors. \"Those first tours were very grueling in the way that it is when you're not used to it\", recalled Alvarez.

Egerton remembered \"What was interesting about putting that band together at that time was that there were two already functioning chemistries that existed: Milo and Bill, and me and Karl.\" \"They had all these really cool experimental, instrumental deals going\", recalled Aukerman. \"Stephen came in with these crazy songs, this kind of King Crimson-eque thing, and I was like 'ooh, okay.'\"Alvarez wrote \"Coolidge\", which deals with a failed relationship and the realization that \"I'm not a cool guy anymore, as if I ever was before\". \"That's proven to be one of our identifying songs\", said Stevenson 26 years later, \"Here he is, new to the band, he walks in and writes one of the songs that would define us.\" Egerton's contributions were primarily instrumental; he wrote the music for \"Impressions\", \"Iceman\", \"All-O-Gistics\", and \"Schizophrenia\", and co-wrote the music for \"Van\" and \"Uranus\". \"Stephen harnessed the job of trying to expand some of the melodic boundaries\", said Stevenson. \"He would kind of come up with what I would call the nasty chords.\"Stevenson's \"Clean Sheets\" and he and Aukerman's \"Pep Talk\" also dealt with themes of broken relationships. According to Stevenson, the chorus of \"Clean Sheets\" came to him fully formed one morning as he was waking up: \"'Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true / Those sheets are dirty, and so are you', that was a complete thought: a melody, lyrics, and chords in my head. The way you hear it on the record, I heard that when I woke up. I didn't strum around or plink around, it was just like 'Oh, that's Clean Sheets'. It's done.\" Aukerman's lyrics for \"Iceman\" were loosely based on the 1946 play The Iceman Cometh by Eugene O'Neill.\n\nThe album was titled after the concept of \"All\", which Stevenson and his friend Pat McCuistion had invented during a fishing trip on Stevenson's boat Orca in 1980. According to Aukerman, \"While drinking all this coffee in the midst of catching mackerel they came up with the concept of All \u2014 doing the utmost, achieving the utmost. The more they got into it the more it turned into their own religion; it's partly humor, but it's also an outlook on how to conduct your life: to not settle for some, to always go for All.\" Stevenson described the concept of \"All\" as \"the total extent\", and he and McCuistion had quickly written several short songs \"in a fit of Allular frustration\", two of which were recorded for All: \"All\" and \"No, All!\". \"The songs were only seconds long, but that was all the time we needed to make the point\", he said. McCuistion also shared writing credit on \"All-O-Gistics\", a musical set of commandments for achieving All, such as \"Thou shalt not commit adulthood\", \"Thou shalt not partake of decaf\", and \"Thou shalt not suppress flatulence\". \"Stephen had those chords, and I wrote my own religion for his chords\", said Stevenson.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53406", "text": "All was recorded in January 1987 at Radio Tokyo studios in Venice, Los Angeles with recording engineer Richard Andrews, who had recorded Enjoy!

It was more like 'I'm embarking on my life's career to do this.'\" \"I toured him to death,\" said Stevenson. \"We did all those tours in a row and he's like 'I gotta go focus on my studies and do something real.' I mean, we were making five or ten dollars per day in our pocket and that's it. We had nowhere to live, and you could see where a guy with the kind of brainpower he has would say 'You know what? I don't have to sleep next to Bill's drum set in the practice room.'\"With Aukerman's departure announced in advance, Stevenson took the opportunity to relaunch the band afresh under the name All with singer Dave Smalley, formerly of the Washington, D.C. hardcore band Dag Nasty, meaning for the new band to be the complete fulfillment of the \"All\" concept. \"I've been wanting to change the name of the band to ALL for eight years\", he said during the FinALL tour, adding that it would not feel right to continue as the Descendents without Aukerman and that he wished to shelve the name in case he and Aukerman should wish to use it again at some point.

However that August they amended the expected release date to March 2007. In November 2006 drummer Lane Pederson stated that the band were \"working at D4 speed on a new record. About half of the songs are written.\" A month later bassist Patrick Costello announced in an interview that the album would be released in the Spring of 2007, stating that it was being pushed back so that the band would be better prepared to tour in support of it:\n\nWe're aiming for the Spring but we\u2019re not being that vague just because of concerns of when the record's ready. It\u2019s more to do with when we want to tour. Right now it's more that Lane's having a baby and Billy might be selling his house. Just all sorts of crazy shit like that. We're waiting to see when would be the best time that we could leave for two and half months.\n\nThe album went unreleased in the Spring and Summer of 2007, however, and guitarist Bill Morrisette stated in September that the band were still working on it:\n\nThe new record is coming along great! The new jams are high energy, and are gonna be a blast to play live. We're working on really using all three vocals, which we used to do a bit more in the early days and works great, and people always seem to want more of, so that will be fun. But mostly I expect a great Dillinger Four record: fun, fast-paced, great change-ups and a couple songs on this one where it's a bit different than stuff we've done before.\n\nIn December 2007 guitarist Erik Funk remarked on the album's progress, stating in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Star Tribune that \"We have a lot of stuff written and are gonna take the next few months to finish an album.\" Months continued to pass with no release details, however, and on April 1, 2008, the music news website Punknews.org poked fun at Civil War's long-delayed release by making a fake news post in celebration of April Fools' Day giving false cover artwork and song titles for the album. In July Dillinger Four announced that they were entering a recording studio to finish the album, and that it would be completed by August. This recording session took place at The Terrarium in Minneapolis with producer Dave Gardener. On August 19, 2008 Fat Wreck Chords posted the official cover artwork on their website and set a release date of October 14. The full track listing was subsequently listed on the band's official website and the Fat Wreck Chords website. On September 16 the band posted the song \"Americaspremierfaithbasedinitiative\" for listening on their Myspace profile, and on September 18 Fat Wreck Chords made the song available as a free download through their website. The full album was made available for listening in streaming media on the band's Myspace profile on October 8.\nIn an interview with Chart magazine shortly before Civil War's release, Funk reflected on the reasons for the long delay:\nWe weren't trying not to put out a record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a deadline on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, we thought it would be fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [Civil War's songs were written in] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.\n\nFunk described the album as \"all around slicker, occasionally heavier, more melodic, poppier and longer\" than previous Dillinger Four albums.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53427", "text": "An early internet leak of Civil War was a source of some controversy. Aaron Hale-Williams, a writer for the online publication Racket Magazine, was given a password-encoded streaming media version of the album by Fat Wreck Chords so that he could publish a review prior to its release. Hale posted the password and a link to the album stream on the music news website Punknews.org, and the album soon spread onto peer-to-peer networks after the streaming audio was converted into MP3 format. Racket Magazine Editor Jonathan Yost learned of the leak from Hale and contacted Fat Wreck Chords: \"He called me to tell me how good it was, and mentioned that he gave it to 'two or three' people. I scoped it on PunkNews and saw that it was all over the place, so [I] dropped Fat a line to change the password before it got too far out of control.\" Meanwhile, Hale had been submitting samples of his writing to Scott Heisel, Music Editor for Alternative Press and former editor for Punknews.org. Heisel had been covering news of Civil War's recording and development for Alternative Press and learned of the album leak, which he called \"illegal...immoral and immature.\" He contacted Fat Wreck Chords to inform them of the situation at about the same time as Yost, and learned that the Hale was the suspected source of the leak:\n\nWhen I asked a friend who worked for Fat where they think the leak came from, they pinpointed it to one specific person from a specific magazine (again, not AP) who had been begging them to hear the record. Upon hearing this person's name, I realized that same person had been emailing and IMing me incessantly for the past few weeks about trying to write for AP...Once I found out the label was holding him responsible for the leak, I promptly wrote him and let him know that AP doesn't use writers who leak records, so I would not need his services.\n\nYost subsequently fired Hale from Racket Magazine, explaining that \"it was very obvious that this was a giant fuck up on our homeslice\u2019s part. So...it was my decision to fire Aaron from Racket.\" Hale responded with his version of events on his blog:\n\nI'm sorry for whom I hurt [at Fat Wreck Chords], but the truth is...I did my job, in a roundabout way. I got people, in a way, really hyperventilating about a band that's been dormant for nearly a decade. In the terms of underground music...that's nearly impossible, with so many bands worthy of attention falling on and off the radar nearly daily. Not that this particular band needs any help, but with years and years of taunting new releases, new music, and then shooting them down, it became a game of \"band who cried album.\"\n\nIn the wake of the controversy artist Mitch Clem published a six-part comic strip satirizing the events in his webcomic Nothing Nice to Say. He received an email from the album's producer Dave Gardener criticizing his satire of the situation: \"As the guy who recorded the record I have to say I found your attempt at social commentary via satire was pretty weak and actually fairly insulting. If you had any idea of the work that all of us, the band, the other guy who did the record and honestly the label put into making the record happen you might have an inkling over how shitty the leaking of the record is to us all.\" Clem responded that the comic was actually intended to oppose music piracy, not to advocate it. Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that \"It sucks that Mr. Hale\u2019s decision to share the album with his friends turned out this way. But he is directly responsible for the leak and needs to accept accountability for his actions. You can\u2019t place the blame on everyone but you because they were forced to react to your initial actions.\" Punknews.org posted a synopsis of the controversy, stating that \"Punknews.org does not support or condone leaking albums. It's not just about the commerce; there are many people who work on an album like this one, it is fair for people to at least be compensated for the time they took away from other jobs, families and friends in order to put together an album for you.\"In an interview with Dillinger Four singer/guitarist Erik Funk for Alternative Press on the day before the album's release, Heisel asked what Funk thought of the controversy surrounding Civil War's online leak. Funk replied that the band members do not have a strong stance on the issue and were surprised at the controversy:\n\nWe were surprised to see it become as big--I mean, the story became way bigger than our part in it. Or it wasn't really about our record. It was just about that circumstance. For us, none of us have a real strong position against people sharing music. I mean, I think that's fine.

Reviewer Jason Lymangrover of Allmusic commented that the album \"[holds] strong to their melodic punk roots, but [shows] a new, more mature side of the band. The fiery pep is still intact here, but the carefree days of 'He's a Shithead (Yeah, Yeah)' have been replaced with thoughtful lyrics dealing with social injustices...it's their most glossy, most consistent, most calm, and surprisingly, their most socially relevant album, despite their approach toward middle age on a teen-oriented punk playground.\" Chris Fallon of Absolutepunk.net also praised the album, calling it \"a new stitch in a damaged American flag; it's the healthy new dose of oxygen we are severely in need of in a crippled music industry starved of substance.\" He particularly praised the band's songwriting and use of melody, stating that \"The record is audibly more melodic than previous releases, with a focus on pop-infused choruses and hooks, all while still containing that raw focal point the band has continually reached for on past albums.\" Maximum Rocknroll magazine coordinator Justin Briggs wrote in the December 2008 issue, \"[...] While nothing they ever do will knock Midwestern Songs of the Americas from the position of 'DILLINGER FOUR's best album,' which is an impossible feat among impossibilities in itself, Civil War has tracks that I'd definitely put on a 'Best of DILLINGER FOUR' mixtape - quite a few, actually. [...] Just f**king buy it already.\"Not all reviewers praised the album, however. Scott Heisel of Alternative Press gave it three out of five stars, noting that the band's extended period of inactivity did not allow them to test the new songs in front of an audience, and thus \"the band's fourth proper full-length isn't the New Testament of beard-punk that so many Fest attendees want it to be.\" He also remarked that their hiatus had distanced them from contemporary punk, and thus Civil War sounds dated and \"lacks bite and innovation.\" Heisel also felt that it did not measure up to the promise of the band's earlier work, stating that \"While the album has bright spots, overall it feels a bit dull and without the spark that made 1998's Midwestern Songs of the Americas so fresh and exciting. With the albatross around their neck finally loosened, Dillinger Four have the talent to return with another truly great, defining punk album\u2013hopefully it'll be before 2014.\" Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club remarked that the album was \"mostly interchangeable with its predecessors, right down to the silly samples that bookend the songs\" and that \"after six long years, it would've been nice for Dillinger Four to deliver something beyond more of the same\". He did note, however, that the band's pop tendencies were more prominent than on previous releases, and that Funk's vocals were clearer, citing \"Contemplate This on the Tree of Woe\" and \"Americaspremierefaithbasedinitiative\" as strong tracks and saying that \"Fruity Pebbles\" \"may be D4's most accessible song yet\".Punknews.org ranked the album at number two on their list of the year's 20 best releases.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53429", "text": "All songs written by Dillinger Four (Patrick Costello, Erik Funk, Bill Morrisette, and Lane Pederson)\n\n\"A Jingle for the Product\" - 3:47\n\"'Contemplate This on the Tree of Woe.'\" - 3:03\n\"Parishiltonisametaphor\" - 2:59\n\"Gainesville\" - 3:39\n\"Ode to the North American Snake Oil Distributor\" - 2:29\n\"Minimum Wage is a Gateway Drug\" - 2:24\n\"The Classical Arrangement\" - 2:24\n\"Americaspremierefaithbasedinitiative\" - 3:21\n\"The Art of Whore\" - 3:14\n\"Fruity Pebbles\" - 3:06\n\"A Pyre Laid for Image and Frame\" - 2:51\n\"Like Eye Contact in an Elevator\" - 3:10\n\"Clown Cars on Cinder Blocks\" - 3:18", "hasanswer": false}]}

Guitarist S.

There, they met two girls who were friends with an A&R person, and brought the girls back to the studio with them. When the A&R person came looking for the girls, the bandmates played their demos for him. Although seemingly disinterested at first, he agreed to try and get them a recording contract. Eight months later, the band, now under the name D'Molls, signed a contract with Atlantic Records, with Priest rejoining the band at this time.  Two years later, they released their debut album, D'Molls. The video for \"777\" received some airplay on MTV, but album sales failed to prosper.

And it was one of those moments where it was like, this is a legendary man, but it's a different side of him. It seemed real vulnerable and real personal.

He had been playing guitar prior to his polio and decided to continue despite his handicap, which led to his development of the butter knife method.Once he sufficiently mastered his variation on slide guitar  playing, Davis began playing in various nightclubs across the Mississippi Delta area.  He played with Robert Nighthawk for a ten-year period from 1953 to 1963.  While playing in a club in 1957, a police raid caused the crowd to stampede over Davis. Both of his legs were broken in this incident and he was forced to use a wheelchair from that time onwards.  The hardships resulting from his physical handicaps were a major influence on his lyrics and style of blues playing.\nDavis moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas in the early 1960s and continued his artistic work.  In recent times, Davis' music has been released by the Fat Possum Records label to much critical acclaim.  His 1994 album, produced by Robert Palmer, Feel Like Doin' Something Wrong, received a 9.0 from Pitchfork Media, which called it \"timeless.\"\nThe Best Of CeDell Davis (1995) was also released, with help from Col.

Yet, he is regarded (and was acknowledged) as being a musician who was highly influential for other prominent musicians, such as Fats Domino, Allen Toussaint and Dr. John.After suffering a stroke, Professor Longhair recorded \"No Buts \u2013 No Maybes\" in 1957. He re-recorded \"Go to the Mardi Gras\" in 1959. He first recorded \"Big Chief\" with its composer, Earl King, in 1964. In the 1960s, Professor Longhair's career faltered. He became a janitor to support himself and fell into a gambling habit.After a few years during which he disappeared from the music scene, Professor Longhair's musical career finally received \"a well deserved renaissance\" and wide recognition. He was invited to perform at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1971 and at the Newport Jazz Festival and the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1973. His album The London Concert showcases work he did on a visit to the United Kingdom. That significant career resurrection saw the recording of the album Professor Longhair \u2013 Live on the Queen Mary, which was recorded on March 24, 1975, during a private party hosted by Paul McCartney and Linda McCartney on board the retired RMS Queen Mary.By the 1980s his albums, such as Crawfish Fiesta on Alligator Records and New Orleans Piano on Atlantic Records, had become readily available across America. In 1974 he appeared on the PBS series Soundstage (with Dr. John, Earl King, and The Meters). In 1980 he co-starred (with Tuts Washington and Allen Toussaint) in the film documentary Piano Players Rarely Ever Play Together which was produced and directed by filmmaker Stevenson Palfi. That documentary (which aired on public television in 1982 and was rarely seen since), plus a long interview with Fess (which was recorded two days before his sudden death), were included in the 2018 released project \"Fess Up\".Professor Longhair died in his sleep of a heart attack while the filming of the documentary was under way (and before the live concert, which was planned to be its climax). Footage from his funeral was included in the documentary. He was interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in New Orleans.Professor Longhair's manager through those renaissance years of his career was Allison Miner, of which jazz producer George Wein was quoted saying: \"Her devotion to Professor Longhair gave him the best years of his life.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53635", "text": "His song \"Tipitina\" was covered by Hugh Laurie on the 2011 CD album Let Them Talk.

Laurie used to perform these two songs regularly during his world concert tours of 2011\u20132014 with The Copper Bottom Band, and in March 2013 paid tribute to Professor Longhair in a special concert on board RMS Queen Mary.The New Orleans music venue Tipitina's is named after one of Longhair's signature songs, and was created specifically as a venue for Longhair to perform in his aged years.

He was especially enamored with Cuban music. Longhair's style was known locally as \"rumba-boogie\". Alexander Stewart stated that Longhair was a key figure bridging the worlds of boogie-woogie and the new style of rhythm and blues. In his composition \"Misery,\" Professor Longhair played a habanera-like figure in his left hand. The deft use of triplets in the right hand is a characteristic of Longhair's style.\n\nTresillo, the habanera, and related African-based single-celled figures have long been heard in the left hand-part of piano compositions by New Orleans musicians, such as Louis Moreau Gottschalk (\"Souvenirs from Havana\", 1859) and Jelly Roll Morton (\"The Crave\", 1910). One of Longhair's great contributions was the adaptation of Afro-Cuban two-celled, clave-based patterns in New Orleans blues. Michael Campbell stated, \"Rhythm and blues influenced by Afro-Cuban music first surfaced in New Orleans. Professor Longhair's influence was ... far reaching. In several of his early recordings, Professor Longhair blended Afro-Cuban rhythms with rhythm and blues. The most explicit is 'Longhair's Blues Rhumba', where he overlays a straightforward blues with a clave rhythm.\" The guajeo-like piano part for the rumba-boogie \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\" (1949) employs the 2-3 clave onbeat/offbeat motif. The 2\u20133 clave time line is written above the piano excerpt for reference.\n\nAccording to Dr. John, the Professor \"put funk into music ... Longhair's thing had a direct bearing I'd say on a large portion of the funk music that evolved in New Orleans.\" This is the syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to swung subdivisions). Alexander Stewart stated that the popular feel was passed along from \"New Orleans\u2014through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s,\" adding, \"The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes. Concerning funk motifs, Stewart stated, \"This model, it should be noted, is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53637", "text": "Black or white, local or out-of-town, they all had Longhair's music in common.

It was recorded in early 1985 at Weryton Studios, Munich, following a turbulent period: co-founder, lead guitarist and co-principal songwriter Mick Jones and drummer Topper Headon had been dismissed by lead vocalist Joe Strummer and bassist Paul Simonon. Jones and Headon were replaced  by three unknowns: guitarists Vince White and Nick Sheppard and drummer Pete Howard. During the tense recording sessions, Clash manager Bernie Rhodes and Strummer fought each other for control over the band's songwriting and musical direction.\nStrummer and Rhodes co-wrote most of the songs. During production, Rhodes took charge of the arrangements, track sequencing and the final mix. His production choices, which rely heavily on Strummer's preference for synthetic drum sounds and Rhodes' own inclusion of sampling, were widely derided. One writer described the album's sound as brash and seemingly \"designed to sound hip and modern\u2014'80s style!\". Rhodes chose the album title, taken from a line in the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2.  The recording process and tension between Rhodes and Strummer left other band members disillusioned. White's and Sheppard's contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix, and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash's success in the United States, and planned an expensive video for a lead single. \nOn release, Cut the Crap was maligned in the UK music press as \"one of the most disastrous [albums] ever released by a major artist\". Strummer disowned the album and dissolved the Clash within weeks of its release. He performed only one song from the album live during his solo career, and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash's compilations and box sets. Although it is still generally regarded as the band's worst album, contemporary critics have praised Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance, especially on the tracks \"This Is England\", \"Dirty Punk\" and \"Three Card Trick\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_53639", "text": "The Clash's internal difficulties during 1983 led to two of its core members being fired: guitarist Mick Jones was seen as adopting rock star posturing that lead vocalist Joe Strummer considered anathema to what the band stood for, and drummer Topper Headon had developed a heroin addiction which left him unreliable. After the band undertook rehearsals in London during June 1983, interpersonal tensions reemerged. The two principal songwriters no longer trusted each other, due to Jones's frequent absence from rehearsals and use of synthesizers. Both Jones and bassist Paul Simonon have said that they refused to sign the contract negotiated by manager Bernie Rhodes, who had earlier been fired due to personal differences with Jones.The relationship between Strummer and Jones had broken down by this point. Not long into rehearsals, Strummer and Simonon had fired Jones. A week before the official announcement of the dismissal, Strummer, Simonon and Rhodes began to look for replacements and  met Pete Howard. The band placed anonymous advertisements for replacement guitarists in the magazine Melody Maker. After auditioning over 100 candidates, they eventually hired unknown musicians Nick Sheppard and Greg White. White took the pseudonym Vince after Simonon complained that he would prefer to quit than play in a band with someone named Greg. Both were given a weekly wage of \u00a3100 rather than recording contracts.Strummer had been the band's principal lyricist, while Jones had written their music. After Jones was fired, the band assumed that anyone could write a punk song. This proved to be a mistake and, unknown to members of the Clash, Rhodes had already conceived his own solution to Jones's departure\u2014he would take control of the music.Strummer intended the second Clash line-up to encapsulate a back-to-basics approach to punk. The new musicians largely avoided the reggae-influenced style of their two previous studio albums, Sandinista! (1980) and Combat Rock (1982). Strummer began to refer to the line-up as \"the Clash, Round Two\", a phrase adopted by the press as \"the Clash Mark II\". They booked a short tour of the US West Coast, debuting new songs, which prompted Jones to boast to concert promoter Bill Graham that he was planning his own tour with Headon as \"the Real Clash\". Jones's lawyers had frozen the band's earnings from both the US Festival and sales of Combat Rock (1982). In response, Strummer wrote the song \"We Are the Clash\", which, along with \"Three Card Trick\", \"Sex Mad Roar\" and \"This Is England\", was debuted during live appearances in January 1984. In all, the Clash Mark II had written around 20 new songs before entering the studio to record what became the band's final studio album.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53640", "text": "The album was recorded between January and February 1985, on a 24-track mixing desk in Weryton Studios, Unterf\u00f6hring, outside Munich, Germany, with some parts recorded in London. Epic Records chose the German studio because the band's finances were dependent on ongoing legal cases, including moves by Jones to prevent them recording under the name \"the Clash\". Rhodes hired engineer Micheal Fayne on the basis of affordability, and his prior experience with programmed drum machines, which Strummer wanted to use on the album because, according to Rhodes, \"Joe wanted to compete with Mick's drum machine thing\". Rhodes also employed engineers Ulrich A. Rudolf, Simon Sullivan and Kevin Whyte, who are credited on the sleeve.Strummer and Rhodes disagreed on the direction of the recordings almost from the outset. Rhodes, credited on the sleeve under the pseudonym \"Jose Unidos\", had no previous experience with either songwriting or record production. While Strummer had been pleased with his demo versions, he fought against his manager over the album's production. Rhodes believed he had discovered a new genre, seeking to mix electro, hip hop and cut-up technique. He replaced live musicians with synthetic sounds and layered the tracks with audio from TV programs.Fayne described Rhodes's treatment of Howard as \"damaging\". Rhodes would begin recording sessions by asking the drummer to play what he wanted, but would inevitably respond to Howard's parts by saying \"no, not that\", or \"no, not that either\". In one incident, Rhodes appeared in the recording room and began to \"smash the drum kit up\", at which point Howard stood up and left. Fayne said, \"Bernie didn't want any connection with the past ... He wanted to take it forward, to control it, to mastermind the whole thing, and what they were doing was a bit too reminiscent of what it was\". Disillusioned and lacking reinforcement or direction from Strummer, Howard seriously considered leaving the band at several points.Most of the Clash and the production team liked the football-style chants used in some of the choruses. They were in part inspired by the communal sing-alongs the Clash performed during their busking tour the previous year, and thus evoked memories of a less tense period in their career. The massed vocals were provided by several dozen of their friends and families, and several of the inner team remembered those sessions as the only enjoyable period during the album's recording. The only other aspect that the musicians agreed on was the quality and commercial potential of \"This Is England\", a song into which Rhodes allowed the musicians significant creative input.Rhodes suddenly ended the recordings and took the master tapes from the studio, after which he added further synthesizer parts. Although Jones's use of synthesizers and samplers was one of the main reasons behind his dismissal, those instruments brought him critical and public acclaim with his next band Big Audio Dynamite. When asked at the time for his opinion on the debut BAD album, Strummer described it as one of the \"worst pieces of shit I have ever heard.\" In 1986, Strummer said that he had liked a few of the tunes but \"really I hated it ... I didn't hear [the album as a whole] until it was in the shops.\" Strummer ultimately lost control of Cut the Crap to Rhodes, and became so disillusioned that at one point he asked Jones to rejoin the band, but was refused.Simonon does not appear on any of the final recordings; the basslines were performed by Norman Watt-Roy, former member of Ian Dury and the Blockheads, who was not credited on the sleeve. Howard's exclusion from the album has been lamented by many critics. Knowles described him as an \"astonishingly powerful and prodigious\" drummer, and said that replacing him with electronic percussion was \"like replacing a Maserati with a Matchbox\". Regretting the decision, Strummer later vowed to never use a drum machine again.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53641", "text": "The consensus among critics is that the album's production choices distract from otherwise strong songwriting by Strummer and Rhodes. Strummer's vocals are placed low in the mix, sometimes buried underneath electronic drums, synthetic keyboards and studio effects. The sound has often been described as muddy and cluttered due to multi-layered guitar tracks and backing vocals. Many of the guitar overdubs have been considered unnecessary, given that Sheppard and White were both using Gibson Les Pauls and as such their sounds were tonally similar, and there was not significant variation in either their chord progressions or riffs. Rhodes may have felt the need to fill each channel on the 24-track mixing desk. Author Gary Jucha summed up the album as having been produced by a manager whose musical ambitions were overstretched by a lack of experience.The over-laid vocals in the choruses, which give the football chant feel, were harshly viewed by critics at the time, both because the effect seemed like low-brow rabble-rousing, and they compared unfavorably with Jones's earlier backing vocals. The drums are largely untreated with sound effects which left them sounding dull. Knowles suggested that adding reverb would have helped to create a more organic \"roomy\" sound, so the songs wouldn't feel \"so canned and phony\". Against this, the live instrumentation is tight and cohesive. Each of the new recruits was a skilled musician, and they had just come off a tour during which Rhodes had instructed them not to vary song structures or guitar leads between performances.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53642", "text": "The album cover was conceived by Rhodes, who contracted Mike Laye to shoot the pictures.

It shows a punk, apparently King's brother, wearing a mohawk, black leather jacket and sunglasses\u2014all markers of 1980s punk fashion. The image is rendered so that the portrait looks like a poster glued to a wall. A similar image appears on the 7-inch release of \"This Is England\". A lithograph of the cover is held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, who attribute an \"unknown designer\".Rhodes titled the album, taking the words \"cut the crap\" from a scene in the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2, when Mel Gibson's character, Max Rockatansky, insists on driving the oil tanker on which the settlers' survival depends: \"Come on, cut the crap. I'm the best chance you've got.\" According to Jucha, the sentiment reflected the band's view of themselves in the mid-1980s: \"the back-to-basics Clash, Round two\u2014like the initial band of UK punk rockers\u2014were going to eradicate the meaningless New Romantic bands dominating the British pop world.

Their music mixes elements of rock with blues and pop. They are best known on their native Long Island, although they had some success nationally and internationally.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_53675", "text": "Formed in 1964, the original group consisted of five students from St. John's University in Queens, New York: Ted Haenlein, Frank Stapleton (Frank never plugged in his bass as he did not play it, but it looked good on stage), Eric Crane, Denny Ryan and Peppi Marchello. The group was originally called the U-Men and played most of their gigs in the Rockaways (Peyton Place & McNultys) and Long Island (The Attic, Tiger's Tail etc.)\nIn 1966, Stapleton's brother, John, arranged for the group to play at a club in Queens, New York (The John Doe Room) where a record company executive heard them and eventually signed the band, but suggested a name change was in order. The band continued to play top 40 covers while working on their own original music.\nBy the fall of 1966 the composition of the band had changed with Peppi's brother Micky on guitar, Denny Ryan on drums, Teddy H. on rhythm & singing, and Art Fahie (aka/ Crazy Artie) on bass. The introduction of the \"Rats\" to Long Island's northshore took place at a club called the \"Knotty Knee\", whose owners Jack Dowd & Al Cunningham trusted the group to fill the venue seven-nights per week. A few years later, Marty Ross took ownership of the place under the name \"McDimples\", and for a while everything went on as it had been.  The \"Rats\" were also known for playing \"The Cage\" in Williston Park, as well as \"The Go-Go 7\" in Port Washington. In 1968, \"Teddy\" Haenlein was drafted and went to Vietnam, but did rejoin the group from 1970 to 1972.\nIn 1969, the band released their first album, the self-titled The Good Rats which had cult popularity with New Yorkers local and transplanted when it launched.  Two of its more memorable cuts are the intro song: \"We Are The Good Rats\" where the band members sing the \"hello-hello-hello\" greeting used by the 3 Stooges; and the landmark \"Joey Ferrari\", a proto-punk song (\"Joey Ferrari, though you're from the poor side, don't give you no right to go wild\"). The Good Rats continued to build a following, playing Long Island's thriving club scene, along with other groups, such as Twisted Sister and Zebra. From 1970 until early 1972, the band consisted of Peppi, Mickey, Teddy (guitar) John Argento (bass) and Charlie Zarou (drums). They played weekly at The Baldwin Manor, Back Alley Sallys (of which Peppi and John Argento took on a partnership of the bar). The Rats doing cover tunes, adding originals in, till originals were primarily asked for, during this time songs such as \"Hour Glass\", \"Injun Joe\", \"Mean Mother\", \"Yellow Flower\", were requested by a fan base that continued to grow rapidly. A rare studio recorded LP, recorded and mastered at Echo Studios, East Meadow, was used for shopping the band to record companies.\nIn 1974, the Good Rats released their best-known and most popular album, Tasty. It featured a blend of hard rock and blues, highlighted by Marchello's raspy vocals.  Various songs from this record, including \"Injun Joe\", \"Papa Poppa\", \"Back to My Music\" and \"The Songwriter\", and the blues title track, received airplay around the country on FM radio. During the following years, the Rats performed at venues such as Madison Square Garden, The Philadelphia Spectrum, The Nassau Coliseum, The Hammersmith Odeon in England, and New York's Central Park, as well as showcase rooms such as The Bottom Line (Manhattan), My Father's Place (Roslyn, New York), Whiskey a Go Go (Los Angeles), Casino Arena (Asbury Park, NJ) and The Paradise Room (Boston). They headlined or opened for bands such as Rush, Journey, Kiss, Meat Loaf, Aerosmith, Ozzy Osbourne, The Grateful Dead, Bruce Springsteen, The Allman Brothers Band, Mountain and Styx.Between 1976 and 1980, The Good Rats released a series of albums, including Ratcity in Blue, From Rats to Riches (1978), Birth Comes to Us All, and Live At Last, all of which were well received by the band's fan base, and received some airplay on FM radio.  In 1981, Gatto and Kotke left the band, and were replaced by future Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick and bass player Schuyler Deale (who later played with Billy Joel and Michael Bolton), for the album Great American Music. The band did shows until 1983 and then broke up.\nThroughout the 1980s, Peppi Marchello continued to write and produce recordings with his son Gene. They toured locally for a while under the name \"Popzarocca\" until the song \"First Love\" became a minor hit for Gene's band, Marchello.  Marchello also recorded a music video for \"First Love\", and had received minor airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball. This band featured Gene on guitar and lead vocals, drummer John Miceli (Meat Loaf, Rainbow, and bassist Nick DiMichino (NineDays [Something To Listen To, Monday Songs, Three, The Madding Crowd, So Happily Unsatisfied, Flying the Corporate Jet]), (Matt White [Best Days]). The band recorded two albums (only one which was released).\nIn the mid-1990s, Marchello and sons Gene Marchello and Stefan Marchello began playing out locally under \u201cThe Good Rats\u201d name. They released three new studio CDs with this lineup, Tasty Seconds (1996), Let's Have Another Beer (2000), and Play Dum (2002).  Marchello also released a live recording of a 1979 appearance on a Rochester radio show, Rats, The Way You Like \u2019Em.\nIn 1998, Marchello wrote \"A Tale of Two Balls,\" the introduction to the book Conflicts of Disinterest (Aardwolf Publishing) by Clifford Meth.In the 2000s, the band continued to play in local venues throughout New York, Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as playing annually in their own summer weekend outdoor festival aptly named \"Ratstock\".  At one point, the \"new\" Good Rats (Peppi and his sons) performed as the opening act for a reunion performance by the \"old\" Good Rats. Billed as \"The Original Good Rats\" Peppi was joined by Mickey, Kotke, Franco, and Gatto on October 4, 2008, in a small venue on Long Island, and for a pair of sold-out shows at B.B. King's in Manhattan.\nIn 2008, Gene Marchello left the band to go out on his own.  Nevertheless, The Good Rats, featuring Peppi and Stefan Marchello continued playing weekend club dates around Long Island.\nThe Good Rats were inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2008.\nPeppi Marchello is quoted prominently in the IDW Publishing graphic novel Snaked by Clifford Meth and has been the subject of other stories by the author.In July, 2009, Peppi Marchello cut a series of three commercials for the car donation organization Kars4Kids.In Magnolia Pictures 2011 release Roadie, the character Nikki pulls out Ratcity in Blue from Jimmy's vinyl record collection and they listen to a couple of tracks starting with \"Advertisement in the Voice\". This brings back memories of them seeing the band every Saturday night with their friend Steph when they were in high school. Peppi Marchello makes a cameo appearance in the film.\nIn 2012, Peppi Marchello released a new Good Rats album, Blue Collar Rats: The Lost Archives on his Uncle Rat Music label.  The CD contained one new song plus 19 previously unreleased songs recorded between 1975 and 1984, some featuring the original Good Rats line-up, and others including Kulick, Deale, Gene Marchello and various other musicians.\nThe Original Good Rats continued to play two spring shows (in one night) annually at Manhattan's B.B. King's, as well as a show in the fall at \"The Crazy Donkey\" in Long Island, until 2013.\nPeppi Marchello died on July 10, 2013, of a heart attack at his Nissequogue home. He was 68 and was recovering from heart surgery he had in June.Aardwolf Publishing announced the publication of Peppi Marchello: Song Writer on Kickstarter.In 2014, Stefan Marchello released a posthumous album of material that he and Peppi had worked on before Peppi's death, titled Afterlife. In 2016, he released Making Rock and Roll Great Again, an album that contains more of Peppi Marchello's posthumous material, plus some original material by Stefan Marchello.\nThe band now continues with Stefan Marchello.

The band, with vocalist Adam Agee at the forefront, has matured and altered their formula from blink-182-type power punk to meaningful vertical praise.

It would be great for them to tackle slower, unhurried songs and I would love to see them continue to write more of their own work. Nevertheless there is plenty for the fans to love and for newcomers to enjoy. All in all, I believe that Everything is Different Now sets the standard and is the foundation from which Stellar Kart will continue to work on.

What Stellar Kart needs to do to break the chains of repetition is to drop their producer, not because he isn't cutting it but because it\u2019s time for a change of scenery. They need to take back all the writing credits for their songs and not rely on others to do the work for them. They need to stop doing tours of teen girl conventions, and youth night at the local Church. If they really want to expand their horizons, it\u2019s time to test the waters and go out on their own. Maybe tour with other General market bands, or like minded Christian artists who have  a similar style. I\u2019m not 16 anymore and I seriously doubt any of these guys are near that age so it\u2019s time to grow up a bit. I know that sounds harsh but the writing style on this album is aimed at Christian teens and it\u2019s like it was purposely written that way. I can\u2019t be the only guy feeling this way? Maybe I'm just burnt out on the Contemporary Christian Market because I've been a part of it in some small way for so many years.\"  Nathaniel Schexnayder of Jesus Freak Hideout concurred by saying: \"I've always thought that Stellar Kart has needed to make changes, both musically and lyrically, to make themselves a more stand-out band. However, while changes have been implemented with their latest release, I can't help but wonder if the album has set them back. Undoubtedly, Stellar Kart fans will fall in love with Everything Is Different Now, but, as a whole, I couldn't wait to stop listening to Stellar Kart\u2019s overproduced, underwhelming album.

Previously, the group had released their major-label debut, My Dinosaur Life (2010) on Columbia; the band parted ways with the label due to the record's lackluster commercial response. Following this, the band returned to their home of Minneapolis, Minnesota, with producer and longtime friend Ackerson. The band entered a local studio and recorded their next effort on their own time and finances. The band recorded Go without a label, and put it upon themselves to pay for mixing and mastering and have conversations with distributors later.\nFrontman Justin Pierre composed the lyrics for Go, which is themed around mortality, growing older, and learning to live in the moment. The reflective tone includes subjects such as procrastination, relationship miscommunication, and optimism, but also personal struggles such as the death of loved ones. Many songs on Go were developed over years at a time, and several date to the band's first few studio albums. Musically, the album retains the band's pop-rock, Moog-based sound, with a heavier emphasis on electronic experimentation. Following the album's recording, the band entered talks with Epitaph Records, where they were signed from 2003 to 2008. Discussions with label founder Brett Gurewitz led the band to re-sign with Epitaph, who co-released Go alongside the band's own label, The Boombox Generation.

The band did not sit down and preconceive the album as a change in style, but rather relaxed and took their time writing it. \"This time we just felt like it was like we were just taking our time and just kinda living life and not worrying about too much other than getting together and making music,\" remarked Taylor. \"Before we would just work on material, make edits, add guitars and then finish. On this record, we kind of worked on a song and then decided to work on a new idea to come up with something,\" said Cain.Ackerson was not worried with the album being perfect; for example, when Pierre forgot to record a lyric at the studio, he recorded it on his computer and sent it to Ackerson, who simply added reverb and mixed it into the recording.

By the age of 10, he was playing the guitar in two techniques, which he described as \"frailing\" and \"picking\".\nIn the 1920s, he lived in southern California, where he operated a hot-dog stand and was befriended by Douglas Fairbanks. He worked briefly as a film extra in The Thief of Bagdad (1924) and East of Suez. In 1929, he settled in Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco, where he worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad for many years as a fireman and a gandy dancer. He married, and he and his wife, Gertrude, had a family. During World War II, he worked as a shipyard welder, but when the war ended, he found it increasingly difficult to secure employment.

For a while, he operated a shoe-shine stand,  where he sang and danced to entertain passersby.\nHe began to compose songs, many of them based on his experiences on the railroads, and also reworked older pieces, playing them in his syncopated style. His one-man band act began when he had difficulty finding reliable musicians to work with: hence, he became known as \"The Lone Cat.\" Starting locally, in clubs and bars in San Francisco and across the bay in Oakland and Berkeley, Fuller became more widely known when he performed on television in both the Bay Area and Los Angeles.\nIn 1958, at the age of 62, he recorded an album, released by Good Time Jazz Records. Fuller's instruments included 6-string guitar (an instrument which he had abandoned before the beginning of his one-man band career), 12-string guitar, harmonica, kazoo, cymbal (high-hat) and fotdella. He could play several instruments simultaneously, particularly with the use of a headpiece to hold a harmonica, kazoo, and microphone.\n\nIn addition, he would generally include at least one tap dance, soft-shoe, or  buck and wing in his sets, accompanying himself on a 12-string guitar as he danced. His style was open and engaging. In typical busker's fashion, he addressed his audiences as \"ladies and gentlemen,\" told humorous anecdotes, and cracked jokes between songs. He told of his love of his wife and family, but some of his stories were anything but cheerful, often including recapitulations of his tragic childhood, his mother's illness and early death, his determination to escape the segregated racial system of the South, suicide, and death.\nIn the summer of 1959 he was playing in the Exodus Gallery Bar in Denver. Bob Dylan spent several weeks in Denver that summer, and picked up his technique of playing the harmonica by using a neck-brace from Fuller.The British label Topic Records issued his album Working on the Railroad in 1959 as a 10-inch vinyl LP, including \"San Francisco Bay Blues\".

His solution was the fotdella, a foot-operated percussion bass, consisting of an upright wood box, shaped like the top of a double bass, with a short neck at the top, and six piano bass strings attached to the neck and stretched down over the body. The strings were played by means of six piano or organ pedals, each connected to a padded piano hammer which struck a string. Removing his shoe and placing his sock-covered foot in a rotating heel cradle, Fuller played the six pedals of the fotdella like a piano. With the instrument's six notes, he could play bass lines in several keys. He occasionally played without it, if a song exceeded its limited range.The name was coined by his wife, who took to calling the instrument a \"foot-diller\" (a \"killer-diller\" instrument played with the foot), which was shortened to fotdella.

Quintanilla did not find the song to have any potential; he has said that he later had a change of heart.In a 2002 interview, A.B. said that during a recording session he had asked Selena to record the song for a fifth time. The singer replied, \"What you got there is what you got\" and left to go shopping. He mused, \"Now looking back, she really did a beautiful job when recording the song, she had so much passion. The song became a classic.\"Although the song was originally intended as a mariachi track, EMI Latin president Jose Behar believed that a mariachi recording would not appeal to the popular market. When the song was set to be released as the third single from the album, the group gave it to Argentine arranger Bebu Silvetti to rework into a pop-style track, and Behar asked Silvetti to \"sweeten\" the song to boost its airplay and chart performance. The result enhanced Selena's pop-radio success and was included in late 1994 reissues of Amor Prohibido, subsequently replacing the original album version. Behar said in a Billboard interview that the song was \"internalized\" without affecting the originality of its recording.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_53744", "text": "\"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" is a downtempo mariachi and pop ballad, incorporating ranchera and flamenco influences into its sound. Musicologists Ilan Stavans and Harold Augenbraum called the song a bolero-mariachi mix. This was echoed by the Lexington Herald-Leader, which noted its bolero influences. Texas Monthly editor Joe Nick Patoski wrote that Vela \"riffed off romantic boleros\" and the song \"showcase[d] Selena's vocal range and control\". \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" has a \"traditional [mariachi] trumpet duet harmony\", using violins and guitars. The original version mainly used acoustic strummed guitars and a synthesized string track; while the single remix, featured on later reissues of Amor Prohibido, replaced this with soft rock instrumentation featuring a drum kit, bass guitar and multitracked acoustic and electric guitars combined with a lush live orchestral string arrangement.The song employs the traditional ranchera storyline, with the female singer agonizing over the end of a relationship. Its lyrics explore unrequited love; when the singer's lover leaves her for another woman, she nevertheless wishes them \"nothing but happiness.\" According to author Lori Beth Rodriguez, Selena sings the song \"in a low, sober voice\", and critic Howard Blumenthal adds that she does so in a \"desperate\" and \"sentimental\" way.

The album itself was marketed as the \"return\" to Van Halen's hard rock roots, with most songs being guitar driven, and the synth sounds being replaced by pianos. The band also reconciled with producer Ted Templeman, who produced earlier Van Halen albums to return to work on the album. According to Eddie Van Halen, this happened because Hagar did not want to work with Andy Johns and Templeman let him \"get away with everything.\" The year-long production led to the 'labored' sound.This was the first album that Eddie recorded without his trademark Marshall Super Lead serving as the primary amplifier. The Marshall was fading, so he went with his 1989 Soldano SLO-100 to record the album primarily, though the Marshall was used sparingly. A prototype for what would become the Peavey 5150 series of custom amplifiers was also used. Peavey's release of the 5150 series coincided with the release of the album.\n\"Poundcake\" featured the sound of a battery-operated power drill, which Eddie held to the pickups of his guitar and revved, creating the intro. \nThe instrumental \"316\" is named for the March 16, 1991, birthday of Eddie's son Wolfgang, who later went on to be Van Halen's last bass player, although the song predates his birth (as part of it was used by Eddie at the beginning of his guitar solo on tour, as seen on Live Without a Net, and was originally written for 5150). On Wolfgang's 25th birthday on March 16, 2016, his mother Valerie Bertinelli posted a photo on her Facebook page of her and Eddie during her pregnancy with the caption \"Ed playing 316 on my growing tummy, before he knew he would call it 316\" Eddie can be seen in the photo playing an acoustic guitar on top of Valerie's pregnant belly.The song \"Top of the World\" features a riff that was first heard on a studio recording during the outro of the 1984-era hit \"Jump\".

In contrast to Take This to Your Grave's rushed recording schedule, Fall Out Boy took a much more gradual pace while working on From Under the Cork Tree. It was the first Fall Out Boy record in which Stump created all the music and Wentz wrote all the lyrics, continuing the approach they took for some songs on Grave. Stump felt that this process was much more \"smooth\" as every member was able to focus on their individual strengths.

Oh!'s and punchy chords of 'Of All the Gin Joints in All the World' are a thrill greater than any Jimmy Eat World album ever; 'Sugar, We're Going Down' 's half-time shifts are triumphs of tumbling words; and the opening track meditates wryly on all-ages shows' fame.

Released in February 1971, just four months after the group's debut LP, the album entered Billboard's Top LP's chart in early April, having been certified gold on 25 March 1971. In its fourth week on the Top 200, the album improved on its predecessor (a no. 4 peak), reaching no. 3 (behind Janis Joplin's Pearl and Jesus Christ Superstar).\nUp to Date yielded the two big pop hits \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" (Billboard no. 6/Cash Box number one) and \"I'll Meet You Halfway\" (Billboard no. 9),  which respectively reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot 100 in March and June.\nIn Canada, both \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" and its parent album reached number one on the RPM charts.As with all Partridge Family albums (with the exception of Bulletin Board), Up to Date was produced by Wes Farrell at United Western Recorders, Studio 2 in Los Angeles. And as with the group's first album, it was engineered by Bob Kovach, with arrangements by Mike Melvoin.\nConsistent with all of the Partridge Family's studio output, the album features musicians associated with iconic Los Angeles\u2013based session players \"the Wrecking Crew\": Hal Blaine (drums), Joe Osborn (bass guitar), Mike Melvoin (keyboard), Dennis Budimir (guitar) and Louie Shelton (guitar). And once again, members of overlapping studio groups the Ron Hicklin Singers and the Love Generation \u2013 brothers John and Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin and Jackie Ward \u2013 feature prominently as backing vocalists throughout the album.\nThe album features three songs written by \"I Think I Love You\" songwriter Tony Romeo, who contributed material to all eight of the Partridge Family's studio albums. The LP also includes five songs co-written by Wes Farrell, including three with prolific lyricist Gerry Goffin (former songwriting partner of Carole King). And two of the songs \u2013 including the hit \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" \u2013 were co-written by Wes Farrell, Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, whose five Partridge Family songs as a songwriting trio include \"I Can Feel Your Heartbeat\". Between 1972 and 1975 Appel worked as manager and producer for Bruce Springsteen.\nUp to Date features David Cassidy's first contribution as a songwriter. With Wes Farrell he co-wrote the song \"Lay It on the Line\". The recording introduced a distorted guitar sound to the group's repertoire.\n\nCassidy publicly despised one of the LP's hits, \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\", and making it proved to be a very hard task. He didn't think it was a good song at all and hated the idea of his having to talk in the middle of it so much so he refused to do it. This caused consternation with the studio and the record company, prompting the involvement of the heads of both Bell Records and Screen Gems, which at the time were the respective record and television divisions of the major Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures. Production shooting of the TV series was halted in order to provide a place in time where his manager and agent could talk to him over the issue. One of the things they were saying was about how many more copies of the record would be sold if it contained a speaking role from him. They put pressure on him until he caved in and did the record as requested.  When it was finished, he was unsuccessful in trying to keep the record shelved in Bell's vaults. His feelings toward the song remained negative: It was horrible, I was embarrassed by it. I still can't listen to that record.\nThe album's distinctive cover (overseen by Bell Records art director Beverly Weinstein) was designed in the form of a calendar indicating the birth dates of the family (including dog Simone), which were the actual birth dates of the cast members.

{"id": "264_447", "question": "What music label is The Deep represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_53913", "text": "The Deep was an American psychedelic rock band made up of musicians from New York City, who in 1966 traveled to Philadelphia to record a one-time LP, Psychedelic Moods.  The band was experimentally progressive, as they were one of the earliest groups to record psychedelic music, before it was adapted by a wider array of musical acts.  Although their only album failed to achieve success, it later gained acclaim for being considered the earliest work to reference \"psychedelic\" in its title.Information on the band is sparse as only one band member had a confirmed musical career prior to recording. The member, Rusty Evans (born Marcus Uzilevsky, 1937, New York City, died December 5, 2015, Woodacre, California), was the Deep's lead guitarist, primary songwriter, and a vocalist.  Evans initially recorded in 1958 as a rockabilly singer, before performing as a Greenwich Village folk musician in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  He recorded three albums as Rusty Evans \u2013 Songs of Our Land, Railroad Songs (both 1964) and Live at Gerde's Folk City (1965) \u2013 and was later a member of the folk group The New Christy Minstrels. Musician David Bromberg is also known to have played on The Deep's one and only album, although it is unknown on which tracks he played.In the early summer of 1966, Evans convinced producer Mark Barkan to help him record a psychedelic album.  They secured arrangements with the Philadelphia-based Cameo-Parkway label, the home for fellow protopunk act Question Mark and the Mysterians, for a meager budget of $1200.  In August, Evans and Barkan assembled a group of New York musicians to record as the Deep, and they drove in a rundown car to Philadelphia to record what would become the Psychedelic Moods album, which was done in the short period of four days and would necessitate late-night sessions in order to be finished on time.  The all-night sessions also provided the musicians, who were unable to afford a hotel, with a place to sleep.While the exact release date of the album has yet to be definitively established, the record is generally considered to have been distributed in October 1966, based on the album's catalogue number. This would credit it as the first official album to include the word \"psychedelic\" in its title, pre-dating the Blues Magoos' debut, Psychedelic Lollipop, and The 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. The Deep's Psychedelic Moods did not sell well, and the group did not tour to support it. They existed as a studio-only band, and, aside from sessions for their album, produced no other recordings under that name.Evans left Cameo-Parkway to record a new album for the Columbia Records label in 1967. Abandoning the \"Deep\" name, this second album was credited to the band The Freak Scene and entitled Psychedelic Psoul. Despite the name change, the band still contained the original lineup from the first album, and the sound of this album is very similar to that of Psychedelic Moods. It is typically considered a follow-up in all but name. As its title suggests, Psychedelic Psoul is composed of psychedelic-influenced tracks as the band continued to develop past concepts from their debut album. However, The Freak Scene's album met the same results as Psychedelic Moods. They did not tour, and their album did not chart. The album has been rereleased by Sony BMG through Columbia Records on vinyl. The group disbanded in late 1967.After this venture, Evans returned to performing as a solo musician. He recorded under his birthname, Marcus, for a self-titled album in 1969, which produced compositions conceived as psychedelic folk in nature. He did not record another album until 1979, when he released Life's Railway Heaven, another folk effort. Evans recorded sporadically until his death, usually in the style of folk or rockabilly music,  and in the 1990s released two new age CDs, Slice of Light and Gypsy Dreams, credited as Uzca.  He also led a Johnny Cash tribute band.  Under his real name of Marcus Uzilevsky, he was a respected visual artist best known for his landscape paintings, and was exhibited widely in California.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), following shipment in excess of 523,408 copies in the United States.

With such foraying display of bravado, T.I. has rightfully earned his membership to hip-hop's elite. Royal salute!\" Allmusic writer Andy Kellman gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 praising the album's lead single \"What You Know\", and stating \"T.I.'s fourth album isn't the leap forward he's been threatening to make, but it does carry the best set of productions he has been given to work with, and it guarantees that he won't be leaving the singles charts any time soon.\" Blender Magazine noted on T.I.'s status saying \"Before his album sold a surprise half a million copies in its first week of release, T.I. was a Southern star who didn\u2019t quite feel like one: He made up with irresistible hooks what he lacked in personality. Now he\u2019s a national star who doesn\u2019t quite feel like one. A breezily charismatic drug rapper, he\u2019s like Jay-Z without the worldview, Young Jeezy without the gravitas; he still hasn\u2019t distinguished himself as an artist worth exploring past the singles. Thankfully, he\u2019s packed album No. 4 full of singles, which might be just as good. His sonorous, self-assured drawl adds an air of unflustered authority to his alpha brags, and he pours it into unexpected patterns. What he\u2019s best at is craft\u2014woozy refrains and hypnotic rhyme schemes\u2014and his fleet of beats is impeccable, highlighted by the four-minute epic \u201cWhat You Know,\u201d which laces imperious synths with an intriguing wistfulness. Throughout, producers Just Blaze, Swizz Beatz and DJ Toomp back T.I.\u2019s self-deifying spiels with wild bombast: he\u2019d seem a lot less kingly if it weren\u2019t for his court.\"Pitchfork stated \"T.I. has always been a great rapper, warm and fluid and confident, his loose elastic voice winding under tracks with force and finesse. Before every other mainstream rapper was talking about drugs, he was doing it with a weary lived-in authority, proudly defiant and sheepishly defensive at the same time, bragging about getting money but lamenting the fact that he only had one way to do it. But great rappers don't always make great albums, and every one of T.I.'s previous full-lengths had a fatal flaw: desperate grabs at radio love, grossly insincere sex-jams, cobbled-together non-cohesion, or all three. Last summer, I thought Young Jeezy's Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101 (2005) was the album T.I. should've made. Young Jeezy isn't half the rapper that T.I. is, but his album-- stunning in its focus and monolithic swagger and deeply nihilistic in worldview-- had more cinematic sweep than anything his progenitor had ever done.\" Matt Cibula of PopMatters described the album as a stunning classic saying that \"Clifford \u201cT.I.\u201d Harris is one of America's greatest songwriters. I'm not just talking about hip-hop, either\u2014even if you add in all the other genres that people go all gaga over, T.I. strides this narrow world like a colossus. No one is smarter, no one constructs tighter songs, and no one has more ways to score. This is proven over and over again on King. T.I. is the whole package: gritty, smooth, smart, dangerous, introspective, and wise. And while it's pretty early in 2006 to talk about albums of the year, this record says it's time to start talking.\" Stylus Magazine noted \"T.I.\u2019s path to a self-made mythology hinges not just on his ability to trumpet himself, but to make his locale and history vital. King, T.I.\u2019s latest, proves, among other things, that his legacy is tied into his town, and his town, Atlanta, is the true Southern metropolis: primal, spiritual, refined, and delicate at the same time. New Orleans may have the painful religious symbolism, Memphis the working-class spirit, and Houston the expansive, halting sound, but Atlanta is the melting pot of bourgeoisie, aristocracy, and neighborhood hustlers. Lil Wayne may be the chaperone of this coast, but T.I. is the CFO. Song to song production is generally top-shelf. From barn-burning \u201cTop Back\u201d to the slyly tender \u201cGone,\u201d every chime chimes when it's supposed to, every snare clacks right into place. Individually, Grand Hustle in-house rising star Toomp gobbles up the lion's share of the praise: the cataclysmic \u201cWhat You Know\u201d and ostentatious \u201cBankhead\u201d both soar. Mannie Fresh and Just Blaze inlay T.I.\u2019s lines with velveteen strings and swirling drums respectively. King isn\u2019t complacent enough to act like all the wars are fought and all the gods are dead; T.I. sees his legacy and city very much up for grabs. A city, a scene and his legacy are unfinished, and while King won\u2019t be T.I.\u2019s last, or, hopefully, best section of his mosaic, it\u2019s the perfection of his aesthetic thus far.\"The New York Times said the album had \"Memorable refrains, hard beats, elegant rhymes: this album succeeds mainly by sticking to a simple but effective formula.\" Entertainment Weekly stated \"Though long at 18 tracks, King still [has] plenty of heavyweight hits.\" The Village Voice's Makkada B. Selah opined that \"Anyone disputing T.I.'s claim to the title 'King of the South' has been summarily silenced by the pageant King's release. The self-proclaimed Dick Cheney of rap showcases many styles, each track here is a multi-layered, highly nuanced production.\" Sputnikmusic's Joe Schmoh noted \"T.I. has always been a prime example of an excellent mainstream rapper from the south. He exudes confidence with every single breath he breaths over the microphone, swinging comfortably from snare hit to snare hit like Tarzan of the beats. However, whether it's Ludacris, Rick Ross, or T.I., the problems are all the same. T.I. has no idea at all how to balance an album together. At least he didn\u2019t until he went towards recording King, an album whose title obviously aims towards magnum opus, a record that balances T.I.\u2019s softer side done right with effortless gruff confidence placed on balling records. Basically, King shows T.I. ripping to his full potential. With women, he\u2019s evolved into this sort of country gentlemen, and he shows this over swelling, swollen synthesizers that make his softer side truly something to behold. And yet, it seems like what the real shine still are the bangers. Even the weak tracks sound strong due to T.I.\u2019s superfluous confidence. Normally, records like this just sound like wastes of good beats, but T.I. serves these beats with pure swag and rhythmic ability. He doesn\u2019t even need to rhyme about anything important or relevant, he\u2019s got enough fun punchlines and self-confidence to cover that up. T.I. manages to spend the entire record outshining every single guest, making every beat his own, and even being respectful to the ladies as opposed to misogynistic. Overall, a triumph.\" The Austin Chronicle's Robert Gabriel stated \"Respected from East to West like he was running the Mob,\" T.I. ascends the throne of rap regality on his fourth LP. Consistent as it is tenacious, King's effortless flow over top-grade beats comes courtesy of Mannie Fresh, Just Blaze, and DJ Toomp, and as the synth-laden 'What You Know' has already made the job of radio programmers that much easier, T.I.'s transcends flash-in-the-pan status with a swagger unmatched in hip-hop.

This led to Stevens recording his first single as Mike Stevens Did I dream/I saw a field for Decca Records. It was arranged by John Paul Jones (later of Led Zeppelin) \u2013 for Decca Records but was not a success.In 1967 he suffered mental health problems and returned to his home village of Solva to recuperate. He started to write songs in Welsh and use themes from traditional Welsh music in a conscious effort to create a distinctive Welsh pop music. From 1967 to 1969 he recorded a series of now rare Welsh-language picture sleeve EPs (Mike Stevens, Rhif 2 (Number 2), Mwg (Smoke), Y Brawd Houdini ( The Brother Houdini), Meic Stevens, Diolch yn Fawr (Many Thanks), Byw yn y Wlad (Living in the Country)). These were made for local labels like Sain and Wren, for whom he was one of the first artistes to record. \nHe also performed around Britain during the '60s, as he continued to try to develop a reputation outside Wales. Stevens played on recording sessions (notably for his friend Gary Farr's debut album on the Marmalade label). He made a one-off English language LP, Outlander, for Warner Bros. Records in 1970, but the contract was abandoned by mutual consent. In 1972 Gwymon (Dryw) was released, an album containing some of his best songs such as Gwely Gwag (Empty bed), Merch o'r Fatri Wl\u00e2n and Taed Neb Yn \u00d4l.  In 1972 Gwymon (Wren records) was released, an album containing some of his best songs such as Gwely Gwag (Empty bed), Merch o'r Fatri Wl\u00e2n and Taed Neb Yn \u00d4l. These early LPs have become rare and sought after.\nStevens lived in Brittany between 1974 and 1977, performing in many festivals although he did not make any commercial recordings. He returned to Wales in 1977, and recorded G\u00f4g (Sain records, 1977). In 1978 self-published the disc Caneuon cynnar, of songs from earlier Wren recordings. He also wrote the music for the rock opera Dic Penderyn, based on events in the Merthyr Rising of 1831.  It was staged at the Cardiff National Eisteddfod and had earlier been recorded in Steven's 1972 album Gwymon and the compilation album Disgwyl Rhywbeth Gwell i Ddod.\nIn 1981, Stevens released a cassette of new songs, Cider Glider (The Farnham Sessions) in English, with the Cadillacs to accompany a return visit to Brittany. This was re-released on Voodoo Blues: 1979-92 by Blue Tit in 1994 with additional tracks.\nNos Du, Nos Da was released on Audio records in 1982 and included songs such as M\u00f4r O Cariad, Bobby Sands and Dic Penderyn. This was followed by Git\u00e2r Yn Y Twll Dan Star (Sain, 1983) that included songs from the lost rock opera Hirdaith A Craith Y Garreg Ddu. He used the Cadillacs once again to record Lapis Lazuli (Sain, 1985) which includes the song Erwan. The album Gwin A Mwg A Merched Drwg (Wine And Smoke And Bad Girls) was released in 1987 only on cassette. The band members included session musicians from London including Brian Godding. \nHe moved from Sain to the Flach label for Bywyd Ac Angau (Life and Death) in 1989. This was a bilingual album and more folkish in tone. Ware'n Noeth (Bi bop a lwla'r Delyn Aur) was recorded at Les Studio, Bethesda, and this was his first CD, released by Sain in 1991. This was followed by Er Cof Am Blant Y Cwm ar Crai (In Memory of the Children in the Crai valley), which includes a song of the same name. Stevens continued to make recordings for Sain records, available only on cassette. One was Yn Fwyw (Greater), recorded in the Swroco Tent at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1995. In 1998 he collaborated with lyricist Rob Mills to produce the album Mihangel on Crai records. \nYsbryd Solva (Spirit of Solva) (Sain records) was released during the National Eisteddfod at St Davids in 2002, and Meic a'r Gerddorfa (Meic and the Orchestra) was recorded at the Brangwyn Hall in Swansea and the  Ysgol Dyffryn Aman Hall in Ammanford with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and released by Sain records in 2005. In the later album Icarws (Sain, 2007), Stevens collaborated again with Geraint Jarman. Like Early Songs No. 1 and Ysbryd Solva, this was a collection of his old songs re-recorded.\nAn Evening With Meic Stevens was recorded in 2007 live at The Half Moon, Putney, London, for Sunbeam, and released with a DVD, the first official one from Stevens.  In 2008, his album Gwymon was reissued on the Sunbeam label with two live tracks in addition to the songs on the original album. Another album followed in 2010, Love Songs (Sain) in English. Most of these songs were written in the late 1950s. In August 2011, his latest controversial autobiography, 'Mas o 'Ma', was published.\nIn 2011, Stevens announced that he wanted to migrate to Canada to join an old girlfriend, Liz, whom he met during his time as an art student in Cardiff in the early 1960s. He played several farewell gigs in Wales before leaving for Canada. However, in 2019 he was living in Cardiff.Today Stevens' psych-folk influence can be heard in contemporary Welsh groups such as Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, and his song \"Cwm y Pren Helyg\" was recently covered by Alun Tan Lan. Several CDs of his are available from the Sain label in Caernarfon, and two volumes of his classic 1960s EPs have recently appeared on Sunbeam Records.Stevens can be found occasionally singing in certain pubs/hotels in Aberystwyth until the late hours.

He attended Edison High School and went to Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College from 1971 to 1973.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54028", "text": "Twilley and Phil Seymour met in Tulsa in 1967 at a theater where they had gone to see The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night, and soon began writing songs and recording together. They continued their partnership over the next several years under the band name Oister. Twilley wrote all the songs and played guitar and piano, Seymour played drums and bass, and both sang leads and harmonies. Later, guitarist Bill Pitcock IV played lead guitar on most of their tracks.\nTwilley and Seymour eventually decided to leave Tulsa and try to be discovered in Memphis, Tennessee. By sheer chance, the first recording studio that they wandered into was Sun Studio, where they met, according to Twilley, \"some guy named Phillips.\" After listening to a cassette of their folk/pop/country blend, Jerry Phillips (son of Sun founder Sam Phillips) referred them to the Tupelo, Mississippi studio of former Sun artist Ray Harris, whom both Twilley and Seymour credited for introducing them to rockabilly and adding a harder edge to their sound.Ultimately, Twilley and Seymour left Tulsa and went to Los Angeles in 1974 to find a label, where they signed with Shelter Records, a label with offices in Los Angeles and Tulsa that was co-owned by Denny Cordell and Tulsa's Leon Russell. Cordell promptly changed the group's name from Oister to the Dwight Twilley Band, which sowed the seeds for future problems arising from Seymour's anonymity in the partnership.  Because of Shelter's Tulsa headquarters, they were able to self-produce many songs in their hometown, recording at The Church Studio. They recorded \"I'm on Fire\" in one night at the historic studio. \nThat song became their debut single and reached #16 on the Billboard charts in 1975 with relatively little promotion, largely because the band was in England recording its first album, tentatively called Fire, with producer Robin Cable at Trident Studios. The photos used on the single's picture sleeve were low-quality from a photo booth, even less professional than the band's first promotional picture. The unexpected success of the self-produced \"I'm On Fire\" caused most of the English tracks recorded with Cable to be relegated to a second album, thereafter known as The B Album. Leon Russell then permitted the band to record new tracks at his 40-track home studio, where one of the engineers was Roger Linn, who also contributed lead guitars and bass to some of their recordings.\nDuring an appearance on American Bandstand, the band played what was to be its follow-up single, \"Shark (in the Dark)\", produced by Twilley, Seymour and Russell. The success of the film Jaws, however, caused Cordell and Shelter to reject the single, apparently to keep the group from being perceived as a cash-in novelty act. The eventual follow-up single, \"You Were So Warm\" backed with \"Sincerely\", failed due to distribution problems; just after the single was released, Shelter Records collapsed in the midst of a lawsuit between Russell and Cordell. The Dwight Twilley Band's completed album went unreleased for 10 months due to Shelter's switch from MCA Records to ABC Records for distribution, and The B Album was left unreleased.\nWhen the album Sincerely was finally released in 1976, it failed as well, peaking at #138. During this time, Seymour and Twilley befriended labelmate Tom Petty and Phil sang backing vocals on \"Breakdown\" and \"American Girl\", creating a long-lasting friendship.In 1977, the Dwight Twilley Band performed on the short-lived CBS Saturday morning kids show Wacko!.\nShelter then switched distribution again to Arista Records. ABC elected to keep Petty and J. J. Cale, leaving Twilley alone on the Shelter/Arista label. Pitcock became a credited member of the Dwight Twilley Band during touring and recording of the second album. However, that album, Twilley Don't Mind, proved to be another commercial disappointment in 1977. Seymour left the band the following year, pursuing a solo career with some success until he developed what proved to be terminal cancer. He died of lymphoma in 1993, and as of 2007 Twilley still did not perform Dwight Twilley Band songs that featured lead vocals by Seymour.The Dwight Twilley Band albums were reissued in CD form with bonus tracks by the audiophile DCC Compact Classics label in 1989 and 1990. In 1993, shortly before Phil Seymour's death, the Dwight Twilley Band released The Great Lost Twilley Album, which collected a fraction of the \"hundreds\" of early unreleased songs Twilley and Seymour had recorded for Shelter, including several songs from The B Album and Blueprint (a Twilley solo album discussed below), as well as a few alternate versions of released songs. However, once again the Dwight Twilley Band fell victim to some label politics, as EMI bought the rights to Shelter just weeks after the release, and all three of the DCC Dwight Twilley Band albums went out of print again.\nIn 1997, The Right Stuff, a reissue label owned by EMI, reissued Sincerely and Twilley Don't Mind with somewhat different bonus tracks from the DCC versions. They both went out of print the following year, when EMI discontinued the label.\nThe Dwight Twilley Band albums Sincerely and Twilley Don't Mind were reissued in a two-disk compilations by Australia's Raven Records in 2007 with still different bonus tracks.\nFinally, in 2009, a tape of the Dwight Twilley Band's October 1976 concert at the Agora Theatre and Ballroom in Cleveland, Ohio, which had been recorded for broadcast on Cleveland radio station WMMS, was remastered and released as a live album entitled Live From Agora.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54029", "text": "After the demise of the Dwight Twilley Band, Twilley continued as a solo act, keeping Pitcock on lead guitar and adding Susan Cowsill on harmony vocals. This lineup released the album Twilley for Shelter/Arista in 1979, although the album's most successful song, \"Darlin'\", featured backing vocals by Seymour. Twilley's next album, Blueprint, co-produced by Jack Nitzsche, was rejected by Arista after the failure of the 1979 single \"Somebody to Love\" although it was assigned an Arista release number. Blueprint ultimately was never released, keeping Twilley out of circulation until his Shelter contract expired at the end of 1981.\nTwilley then moved to EMI America for Scuba Divers (1982), a combination of rejected Blueprint tracks and new material. His follow-up album, Jungle (1984), produced his second national hit single, \"Girls\", featuring a counterpoint vocal by Petty, which also reached #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #2 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart. His follow-up single, \"Little Bit of Love\", reached #77.  Twilley left EMI America at that point, which once again dissipated his momentum from the hit. Twilley's 1986 album Wild Dogs was recorded for Private I Records, a custom label run by independent radio promoter Joe Isgro that was distributed by Epic Records; however, when Isgro was implicated in a 1986 radio promotion scandal, Private I Records collapsed. Instead, the album was quietly released by Epic's CBS Associated label, where it went largely unnoticed, despite the appearance of the last Twilley/Seymour song, \"Shooting Stars\".\nAfter the failure of Wild Dogs, Twilley found himself without a label (or a lead guitarist, as Bill Pitcock IV had quit). Twilley wrote a parenting book based on his long-distance relationship with his daughter Dionne, entitled Questions From Dad. He then titled his next album, intended for release in 1994, The Luck. The irony did not help Twilley with record label executives, and Twilley was unable to secure distribution for it.\nIn 1996, EMI issued a 21-song Twilley greatest-hits collection entitled XXI, which included two new songs (one of which had been on The Luck) on its The Right Stuff reissue label, followed by reissues of the two Dwight Twilley Band studio albums the next year. All three of these releases again went out of print in 1998, when EMI discontinued the label.\nHowever, in 1998, Pitcock rejoined Twilley, and the rise of digital audio meant that placing a record on a major label became less of a priority. In 1999, Twilley released both another rarities collection, Between the Cracks, Vol. 1 (Not Lame Records), made up of songs not owned by Shelter, EMI or CBS, and his first new album in 13 years, Tulsa (Copper Records). In 2001, Twilley finally released The Luck (Big Oak Records), although with some changes to the version he had completed in 1994. His six-song seasonal EP Have a Twilley Christmas (Digital Musicworks International, \"DMI\") appeared in 2004, followed by two more albums on the same label, his ninth studio album, 47 Moons, in 2005 and his first live album, Live: All Access in 2006.\nTulsa was sold to DMI (now Digital Music Group, Incorporated, or DMGI) in 2004. Additionally, the first two Twilley solo albums Twilley and Scuba Divers are available in two-disk compilations by Australia's Raven Records.

His family moved to Fair Lawn, a small town near Passaic. When he was ten years old, he moved with his parents and younger sister to Kendall Park, a newly constructed suburban section of South Brunswick, New Jersey. The transition upset him. He detested living in the suburbs. He later recalled that it \"was like a prison. I think I lost faith in [my parents'] judgment... It was probably the first time I realized I had my own view of life.\" His life in Kendall Park, including his teenage love of late-night radio, inspired his later album The Nightfly.Fagen became interested in rock and rhythm and blues in the late 1950s. The first record he bought was \"Reelin' and Rockin' \" by Chuck Berry. At age eleven, his cousin, Barbara Cohen, recommended jazz music and Fagen went to the Newport Jazz Festival, becoming what he called a \"jazz snob\": \"I lost interest in rock 'n' roll and started developing an anti-social personality.\" In the early 1960s, beginning at age 12, he often went to the Village Vanguard, where he was particularly impressed by Earl Hines, Willie \"the Lion\" Smith, and Bill Evans. He regularly took the bus to Manhattan to see performances by jazz musicians Charles Mingus, Sonny Rollins, Thelonious Monk, and Miles Davis. He learned to play the piano, and he played baritone horn in the high school marching band. He developed a lifelong fondness for table tennis. In his late teens he was drawn to soul music, funk, Motown, and Sly and the Family Stone. He has also expressed admiration for the Boswell Sisters, Henry Mancini, and Ray Charles.After graduating from South Brunswick High School in 1965, he enrolled at Bard College to study English literature, where he met Walter Becker in a coffee house in 1967. Becker and Fagen attracted a revolving assortment of musicians, including future actor Chevy Chase, to form the bands Leather Canary, the Don Fagen Jazz Trio, and the Bad Rock Band.

The duo achieved both critical and commercial success from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, helping to popularize Southern hip hop with their intricate lyricism, memorable melodies, and positive themes, while experimenting with a diverse range of genres such as funk, psychedelia, jazz, and techno. The duo are widely regarded as one of the most influential artists in hip hop.Patton and Benjamin formed Outkast as high school students. They released their debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik in 1994, which gained popularity after the single \"Player's Ball\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. With successive releases such as the critically acclaimed albums ATLiens (1996) and Aquemini (1998), the duo further developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial success. Outkast then achieved more mainstream and crossover success with their critically acclaimed fourth album Stankonia (2000), which included the singles \"B.O.B.\" and \"Ms. Jackson\", the latter being their first single to reach the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100.\nThe duo then released the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below (2003), their only album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, which featured the number one singles \"The Way You Move\" and \"Hey Ya!.\" The album won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America. Outkast starred in the 2006 musical film Idlewild and recorded the film's accompanying soundtrack, which was released as their final album three days before the film's release. The duo split the following year and both members have since pursued solo careers. Outkast temporarily reunited to celebrate their debut album's 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide, beginning at the Coachella Festival in April 2014.Outkast is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential hip hop acts of all time, and are one of the most successful, having certified sales of 20 million records between six studio albums and a compilation album, as well as having earned six Grammy Awards. Rolling Stone ranked them No. 7 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time, while publications such as Pitchfork and the aforementioned Rolling Stone have listed their albums among the best in all of hip hop and of all time.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_54104", "text": "Outkast's musical style and lyrical content have evolved throughout the group's career. Rolling Stone described their music as \"idiosyncratic\" and \"inspired by the Afrocentric psychedelics\" of George Clinton and Sly Stone, and particularly by the psychedelic funk of Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic collective. The band's debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik incorporates analog elements such as Southern-styled guitar licks, languid soul melodies, and mellow 1970s funk grooves. It also features digital hip hop production elements such as programmed snare beats, booty bass elements, ATLiens and Aquemini feature outer space-influenced production with echo and reverb effects. With Stankonia, Outkast became the first hip-hop act to openly acknowledge rave culture as an influence. Stankonia and Speakerboxxx/The Love Below would draw on sources such as psychedelia, gospel, funk, techno, soul, electro, and rock music. During the late 1990s, rappers tended to embrace slow, laid-back beats in their productions.  On several tracks on Stankonia, the group employed faster, more chaotic tempos to reflect rave culture and the introduction of new drugs such as ecstasy into the hip-hop scene.One central motif of Outkast's songwriting is the duality of the two members and their differing personalities, with Big Boi as \"the player\" and Andr\u00e9 3000 as \"the poet\". Big Boi generally covers the more conventional hip-hop topics such as his childhood in the South, sex, and partying, while Andr\u00e9 3000 discusses more unorthodox themes. In contrast to much of hip hop music in the late 1990s, Outkast did not tone down its Southern regional qualities, like the harmonica break on \"Rosa Parks\" and distinctive Atlanta slang and diction throughout. The duo experimented with several delivery styles on the record, using \"relaxed, hyper, distorted, speedy and conversational presentations.\" Outkast often discusses the status of women in the South, and contrasts with the misogynistic attitudes common in hip-hop music. In Slate, Alex Abramovich praised the duo for \"[tending] to shy away from the misogyny and violence rap is so often (and not always unjustly) condemned for.\" In his book Classic Material: The Hip-Hop Album Guide, Oliver Wang writes that songs such as \"Slum Beautiful\" and \"Toilet Tisha\" \"reimagine 'round the way girls, not only as just more than one-dimensional accessories, but as objects of affection with lives and concerns that are worth exploring.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54105", "text": "During the recording of Stankonia Outkast and Mr. DJ began producing tracks for the artists on their Aquemini Records imprint through Columbia, including Slimm Cutta Calhoun and Killer Mike, who made his debut on Stankonia's \"Snappin' & Trappin.\"\nIn 2002, Outkast participated in the only Dungeon Family group album, Even in Darkness, along with Goodie Mob, Killer Mike, Sleepy Brown, Witchdoctor, and Backbone among others, and featuring Bubba Sparxxx, Shuga Luv and Mello.

The lawsuit alleged that the song misappropriates Parks' name, and it objected to the song's obscenities.The song's lyrics are virtually unrelated to Parks, except for a reference in the chorus: \"Ah ha, hush that fuss / Everybody move to the back of the bus\". The song, which Outkast maintained was intended partly as homage, refers to Parks metaphorically: the purpose of the song's chorus is to imply that Outkast is overturning hip hop's old order, and that people should make way for a new style and sound. In the initial suit, the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan at Ann Arbor granted summary judgment for Outkast.\nLater on appeal, the issue of whether Outkast violated the Lanham Act for false advertising was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. This was based on the Court's determination that the title \"Rosa Parks\" had little artistic relevance, whether symbolic or metaphorical, to Rosa Parks the person. Parks' representation hired lawyer Johnnie Cochran to appeal the decision in 2001, but the appeal was denied. The judge ruled that while there was linkage between the song and Rosa Parks, the song was an \"expressive work\" and was therefore protected by the First Amendment. In 2003, the Supreme Court turned down an appeal to overrule the lower court's decision.In December 2003, Andr\u00e9 told UK journalist Angus Batey that, following a Detroit concert in the midst of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case had less to do with Parks than with the lawyers. In April 2005, the judge in the case appointed an impartial representative for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and her lawyers were pursuing the case based on their own financial interest. The case was settled on 14 April 2005, with Outkast and the co-defendants, Sony BMG and its subsidiaries Arista Records and LaFace Records, admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to develop and fund educational programs concerning Rosa Parks.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Recording sessions for the album took place during 2003 to 2004, with its production handled by his longtime collaborator Jermaine Dupri, along with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Lil Jon, among others. Primarily an R&B album, Confessions showcases Usher as a crooner through a mixture of ballads and up-tempos, incorporating musical genres of dance-pop, hip hop and crunk. The album's themes generated controversy about Usher's personal relationships; however, the album's primary producer Jermaine Dupri claimed the album reflects Dupri's own personal story.\nIn the United States, the album sold 1.1 million copies in its first week. To boost sales amid threats of bootlegging, the special edition for the album was issued, which includes the single, \"My Boo\"; a duet with Alicia Keys. Confessions earned Usher several awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album.\nAccording to Billboard, it is the second-best selling album of the 2000s decade in the United States, behind NSYNC's No Strings Attached.

Prather said, \"The music has never been the question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they're there with you.\" Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real.

I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of.\" He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.\nSeveral of the songs in this album were conceptually based on a situation. For instance, \"Burn\" was built around the winding down of Usher's two-year relationship with Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas from American R&B-Hip hop girl group TLC. Dupri and Cox were talking and felt that there was a song in it, and started writing. Similarly, with the title track \"Confessions Part II\", they were conversing about an impregnated mistress, and its concept was written down. Usher recorded \"Confessions Part II\" during July 2003 recording sessions in New York City.

The collective was able to settle on fifteen of them, with two interludes completing the seventeen track list. Many songs were set aside for future use, including \"Red Light\" and a remix of \"Yeah!\". Usher and Arista held advance listenings for the album, a few months before its actual release; he also appeared on TV guestings to promote Confessions.With strategies to boost the album's sales albeit threats of stealing music in the internet, Usher and his management readied a follow-up release of Confessions with an additional marketing blitz. The idea was considered \"musically driven\" after Zomba, who absorbed Arista, management was excited about \"My Boo\", a song that was recorded for the original version of the album but failed to meet deadline. However, it actually began when American R&B and soul singer Alicia Keys, who is featured on the track, \"brought in that the talk of repackaging started\". With the inclusion of \"My Boo\", they thought of the album as complete. While they knew of other artists releasing special editions of their albums, the label felt that Confessions had the edge because of its previous success and its physical changes, including new cover art, an expanded CD booklet, a pullout poster and a letter to fans from Usher. The new version includes \"My Boo\" and \"Red Light\", which were leaked alongside other songs that did not appear in the album, and a remix of \"Confessions Part II\", and \"Seduction\"; original tracks were also improved like the extended version of \"Confessions Part I\" and a rap added by American rapper Jadakiss in \"Throwback\".

Most of the album was recorded following a grueling tour during which the band was left with little time to compose new material. Record producer Paul A. Rothchild recommended a total departure from the Doors' first three albums: develop a fuller sound by incorporating brass and string arrangements provided by Paul Harris. Lead singer Jim Morrison, who was dealing with personal issues and focusing more on his poetry, was less involved in the songwriting process, allowing guitarist Robby Krieger to increase his own creative output.\nThe album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200, but it failed to retain audiences in the UK and other European countries that their previous album, Waiting for the Sun, had succeeded in engaging. Three preceding singles, \"Touch Me\", \"Wishful Sinful\", and \"Tell All the People\", were included on The Soft Parade, with the former becoming another Top 10 hit for the Doors. Another single, \"Runnin' Blue\", also followed the album's distribution.

A lot of the fragments there were just bits of poetry we put together.\" The lyrics draws comparison to William Blake as well as T. S. Eliot's poem \"Ash Wednesday\", much like many other selections of Morrison's poetry, which are heavily influenced by other poets and authors, notably \"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\" and \"Not to Touch the Earth\".\"The Soft Parade\" itself was an expression coined by Morrison to indicate the bizarre and varied humanity that populated Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles daily. His lyrics express need and pursuit for sanctuary, escape, and pleasure from his point of view. At the beginning of the song, Morrison starts out defiantly with spoken words reminiscent of a Christian revivalist preacher. The track then goes into a harpsichord driven semi-introductory piece with lyrics such as, \"Can you give me sanctuary? / I must find a place to hide\" referencing Morrison's then-current problems, most notably his arrests during the Miami and New Haven concerts.

Records in 1986.\nDestiny was Khan's follow-up to the platinum-selling I Feel for You and was as high tech as its predecessor\u2014symptomatically and characteristically for its period with more producers and sound engineers credited in the liner notes than musicians\u2014but was musically more geared towards rock and pop than soul and R&B, most prominently on tracks such as \"So Close\", the self-penned title track \"My Destiny\", \"Who's It Gonna Be\" and \"Watching the World\" featuring Phil Collins on drums and backing vocals.\nThe album spun off five single releases, the first being \"Love of a Lifetime\", co-written, co-produced and featuring backing vocals by Green Gartside of British band Scritti Politti (US Pop #53, US R&B #21, UK #52). The second single \"Tight Fit\" was a midtempo R&B ballad, just like \"Eye to Eye\" from I Feel for You produced by Russ Titelman, which reached #28 on the US R&B chart. The satirical \"Earth to Mickey\" (When are you going to land?), featuring Khan both singing and rapping (and keyboardist Reggie Griffin rapping in the role of 'Mickey'), was released as the third single in early 1987 and only just made the Top 100 of the R&B chart, peaking at #93. The dramatic ballad \"The Other Side of the World\", written by Mike Rutherford of Genesis and B. A. Robertson and which had first been released as part of the White Nights soundtrack album in late 1985, reached #81. The fifth single \"Watching the World\" never charted. The album itself fared slightly better, reaching #25 on Billboard's R&B albums chart, but stalling at #67 on Pop and #77 in the UK. Destiny however gave Khan another Grammy nomination in 1987 for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female. The track \"My Destiny\" was used as the theme song for Richard Pryor's motion picture Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling.\nThe closing track, the heavily edited one minute thirty-nine seconds \"Coltrane Dreams\", a tribute to John Coltrane, had a backing track mainly made up of samples of Khan's voice. The actual full-length version of the track (4:54) was only released as the B-side of the 12\" single \"Love of a Lifetime\".\n\"Love of a Lifetime\", \"Tight Fit\", \"Earth to Mickey\" and \"Watching the World\" were all released as 12\" singles including extended remixes.\nWhile the success of Khan's own single releases in 1986 was limited to the R&B charts, she appeared as featured vocalist/vocal arranger on two worldwide pop/rock chart hits that same year, Steve Winwood's \"Higher Love\" and Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love\"; on the latter she was only credited for 'vocal arrangement' in the liner notes.

The group includes Hallucinogen and Raja Ram (one of three in The Infinity Project). The duo are considered to be one of the progenitors of the psybient genre \u2014 a genre combining world music with psychedelic trance and ambient. Their musical style combines traditional music from all over the world and vocals with contemporary western synthesizer-based psychedelic music. When asked to describe Shpongle's music, Posford has responded that it is \"like nothing you've ever heard before.\"Shpongle's first track, \"Vapour Rumours\", was released on TIP Records' Infinite Excursions compilation in 1996. Their debut album, Are You Shpongled?, was released in 1998 on Twisted Records.

Raja Ram stated in an interview that \"Shpongle\" is an umbrella term for feeling positive and euphoric emotions. Shpongle's music is heavily influenced by psychedelic experiences and frequently makes use of sonic textures that approximate psychedelic states as well as vocal samples relating to consciousness expansion, hallucinations, and altered states of awareness.

He is best known for his harmonica solos on iconic recordings such as Candy Man (Roy Orbison), He Stopped Loving Her Today (George Jones), I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool (Barbara Mandrell), and others.  He was a member of the progressive country rock bands Area Code 615 and Barefoot Jerry. After recording with Bob Dylan in New York, McCoy is credited for unknowingly influencing Dylan to decide to come to Nashville to record the critically acclaimed 1966 album \"Blonde on Blonde\".\nA prolific session musician, McCoy performed on many recordings by established artists, including Elvis Presley (on eight of his film sound tracks), Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Chet Atkins, Waylon Jennings, Roy Orbison, Leon Russell, and Loretta Lynn. In the recording industry, he was known as the \"utility man\" because of his ability to play with sufficient skill on many different instruments in addition to the harmonica; for example, he played trumpet on Dylan's \"Rainy Day Women \u266f12 & 35\", saxophone on Roy Orbison's \"Oh, Pretty Woman\", and bass harmonica on Simon and Garfunkel's \"The Boxer\". For Elvis Presley's 1965 film Harum Scarum (soundtrack), he played guitar, harmonica, organ, and vibraphone. \nHe is a member of three halls of fame, including the Country Music Hall of Fame and the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame; he was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007 as a part of a group of session musicians dubbed \"The Nashville A-Team\".

When the instrument arrived, McCoy found it hard to get any music out of it, and lost interest.:\u200a3\u200a Later, he moved to Florida to live with his father. On unpacking his suitcase, his father saw the harmonica. To McCoy's surprise, his dad picked it up and played \"Home Sweet Home\", both the melody and his own rhythmic accompaniment.:\u200a5\u200a This was the first time anyone had shown him how the instrument is properly played. McCoy was amazed, and a spark was struck. He soon learned to play 4 songs that he performed at his elementary school assembly.:\u200a5\u200a As he got older, he devoted himself to learning blues harmonica by listening to late-night radio broadcasts originating out of Nashville's WLAC. He acquired records of the great blues harmonica players by mail-order.:\u200a11\u200a  He also learned to play the guitar, and in his teens, the bass and trumpet. While attending Southwest Miami high school, he put together a rock and roll band called \"Charlie McCoy and the Agendas\" as a guitarist and singer. At age sixteen he accompanied a friend to a Miami-based country music barn dance radio show called the \"Old South Jamboree\". Upon their arrival, McCoy's friend left him in the crowd and went to talk to \"Happy\" Harold Thaxton, the host of the show, with the intention of coaxing the reluctant McCoy up on stage to sing.

McCoy cut his first single, \"Cherry Berry Wine\", for the Cadence label; it reached No. 99 on the Billboard chart.

He said, \u201cAfter the song hit the radio, my phone started ringing ... and thank God, 61-years later, it\u2019s still ringing.\u201d He continued to record for the Monument label without a written contract. His ability to give a creditable performance on many different instruments made him a good man to have on any session, and he became known as the \"Utility Man\" by producers.

Their classic lineup (1964\u20131978) consisted of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century. Their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large public address systems, the use of synthesisers, Entwistle's and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk, power pop and mod bands. The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.\nThe Who evolved from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"I Can't Explain\" (1965), reached the UK top ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including \"My Generation\" (1965), \"Substitute\" (1966) and \"Happy Jack\" (1966). In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released \"I Can See for Miles\", their only US top-ten single. The group's 1969 concept album Tommy included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success.\nFurther festival appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight, along with the concert album Live at Leeds (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up the album Who's Next (1971), including the hits \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", \"Baba O'Riley\", and \"Behind Blue Eyes\". The group released another concept album, Quadrophenia (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy (1975).

Each question had odds attached to it depending on the difficulty of the question.

If a player's score dropped to zero during any point in the game, that player was eliminated from further play.\nThe contestant who made the highest wager for any given question was given the right to answer it. If two or more contestants picked the same category and wagered the same amount, James put the question up for auction with the tied contestants now being able to wager up to their entire score if they desired. Bidding continued until one player elected to let the opposing player answer. In the rare case that the auction failed to break the deadlock, both contestants would write their answers down.\nLater in the show's run, a \"lightning round\" category was played (known as the \"3 W's Quick Round\"), in which players buzzed in on rapid-fire questions for 60 seconds.

The next morning, Prince had composed two songs, one of which was \"When Doves Cry\". According to Prince's biographer Per Nilsen, the song was inspired by his relationship with Vanity 6 member Susan Moonsie.\n\"When Doves Cry\" was Prince's first Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single, staying there for five weeks, and was also a worldwide hit. According to Billboard, it was the top-selling single of 1984. It is certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was the last single released by a solo artist to receive a Platinum certification before the certification requirements were lowered in 1989. \"When Doves Cry\" was ranked number one on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1984.

The song features an intro of a guitar solo and a Linn LM-1 drum machine, followed by a looped guttural vocal. After the lyrics, there is another, much longer, guitar and synthesizer. The song ends on a classical music-inspired keyboard piece backed by another synthesizer solo. Keyboardist Matt Fink revealed in 2014 that the baroque synthesizer solo was recorded by Prince at half speed and an octave lower against a half-speed backing track, then sped up to create the final version. Fink was then tasked to learn and perform the solo at the album's speed.On versions edited for radio, either the song fades out as the long guitar and synthesizer solo begins, or the solo is eliminated altogether and the song skips to the ending with Prince's harmonizing and classical finish.\nDuring live performances of the song on the Purple Rain Tour, Prince's bass player Brown Mark added bass lines to the song as well as to other songs without bass lines.The song is in the key of A minor.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54335", "text": "In its contemporary review of the song, Cash Box said that \"featuring ethereal lyrics, a pounding backbeat and a sometimes ominous musical atmosphere, this single again proves Prince to be one of the most provocative and sophisticated artists in the business. .\"\"When Doves Cry\" was No. 1 in the US for five weeks, from July 7, 1984, to August 4, 1984, keeping Bruce Springsteen's \"Dancing in the Dark\" from reaching the top spot.

Davis headed Lewis' former US label J Records before joining RCA Records when the former was folded. Davis had previously played a part in the A&R division for Lewis' albums. The CBS interview titled Clive \"The Music Man\" Davis \u2013 Interview showed Davis talking about Lewis branching out to work with American producers, and about previewing songs before they were presented to Lewis. However, when the track listing for the album was unveiled, \"Burn\" was omitted in favour of another Zancanlla/Lewis/Tedder track, recorded with Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith, titled \"Favourite Scar\". \"Burn\" would later be recorded by British singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding for Halcyon Days (2013), the re-release of her second album Halcyon (2012).\nBritish hip hop artist Tinie Tempah approached Lewis to record a duet with him called \"Trouble\", however after hearing the raw demo sung by Emeli Sand\u00e9, Lewis decided she wanted the song for her own album. Together with Sand\u00e9 and Fraser T Smith, Lewis recorded the song. \"Trouble\" appears on the album in two versions; the first features just Lewis and is the opening track on the album, while the second version featuring a rap from Childish Gambino appears as track thirteen. As a result of recording \"Trouble\", Sand\u00e9 and Lewis struck up a friendship which led to the duo writing several other songs for the album. \"Mountains\" was co-written by Lewis and Sand\u00e9 with Shahid Khan, James Murray, Mustafa Omer and Luke Juby. The piano and strings-led ballad was supposed to feature on Glassheart however for unknown reasons the song was reclaimed by Sand\u00e9 and instead features on her own debut album Our Version of Events (2012). A small unfinished snippet of Lewis' version of \"Mountains\" leaked online on 15 August 2012 along with another song called \"I Miss You Missing Me\", which was written by Grammy-winning songwriter Diane Warren and originally sung by Chinese singer Bibi Zhou in 2010. A third Sand\u00e9 and Lewis-penned song called \"I to You\" did make the album. In September 2011, Sylvia Patterson of The Guardian previewed several tracks including \"Sugar\" and \"Trouble\", both of which feature on the album, in addition to the song \"Blank Page\", which was written by Australian singer-songwriter Sia. The latter was described as \"a soaring reverie over mournful piano and strings\", but it did not make the album. \"Blank Page\" was later revealed to have been given to American singer Christina Aguilera, as it can be found on her 2012 album Lotus. During this same time period, fellow American producer Brian Kennedy Seals revealed that Lewis would record his song \"Open Up\".\nAccording to Yahoo! music, Lewis worked with Ammo and Steve Robson while a press release from Sony Music revealed that Lewis had branched out to work with a variety of international producers, including Swedish producer Jonas Quant, American producer Chuck Harmony and American songwriters Claude Kelly and Al Shux. During this same time, two other American record producers linked themselves to Glassheart. Whilst working as a mentor on American Idol, American music producer Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart noted that he had been asked to submit material for Lewis' new album. French producer Sandy Vee and American songwriter Autumn Rowe presented Lewis with the album's first single \"Collide\". Digital Spy and Popjustice confirmed that Lewis spent time in the studios with producer and writer Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins\", rapper will.i.am and Polow da Don. Lewis' sessions with Darkchild took place over the weekend of 18\u201319 May 2012 and produced the song \"Shake You Up\". Circle House Studios in Miami, Florida was the venue for recording sessions with American songwriter Rico Love.MTV revealed that R&B singer-songwriter Ne-Yo was planning to pen some material for her. It would be their third collaboration, Ne-Yo having previous penned tracks for Spirit and produced tracks for Echo that did not make the final list. Ne-Yo wasn't Lewi's only returning collaborator. Andrea Martin, who co-wrote Lewis' 2008 single \"Better in Time\", worked with Lewis in the first half of 2011. On 1 January 2012 the leaking of a snippet of \"Love Birds\" (later renamed \"Lovebird\") revealed that according to Idolator, Lewis had worked with Bonnie McKee who is known for working with Kesha, Britney Spears and Katy Perry. Lewis also travelled to Nashville, Tennessee in January to record for a week and separately worked with Dallas Austin. McKee later joined studio sessions after Fraser T Smith co-wrote \"Un Love Me\" with Smith and Kelly Sheehan, a writer known for her work with Mariah Carey.\n\nAt the end of 2011, Lewis spoke about another of her collaborators \u2013 this time Scottish DJ Calvin Harris, \"I've worked with Calvin on a song and want to do another \u2013 he's so talented. I'm planning an EP before the end of the year as I feel bad for everyone who was expecting the album this year. But the lead song won't be the track I've done with Emeli Sand\u00e9 \u2013 that's for the album.\" Lewis revealed that she had recorded the song \"We Found Love\" but because she wanted to release \"Trouble\" as her first single, Harris subsequently offered the song to Rihanna while touring with her. Rihanna's version of \"We Found Love\" became a worldwide hit. Lewis released Hurt: The EP in December 2011. The EP consisted of cover songs that had been re-tooled by Smith. During the middle of March, Lewis posted a picture of herself in the studio with Jahlil Beats and Smith, confirming that Smith was now producing material for Glassheart. Later following Lewis' performance at the Radio 1 Hackney Weekend in June, it was confirmed that Smith was overseeing production for the remainder of the album and was the project's executive producer. Norwegian songwriter Ina Wroldsen joined some of Lewis and Smith's studio sessions, notably contributing to the song \"Come Alive\". Orchestral collective the Wired Strings joined Smith in the studio in June 2012, to record the strings section for the song \"I to You\".

Glassheart's album cover was unveiled on 5 September 2011. An editor for The Metro described the cover photo. Lewis stares directly at the camera \"in a continuation of the more sexy and sophisticated look she has been sporting in recent months.\" The reviewer commented on Lewis' styling: \"Her long dark hair is swept back from her face, aside from her ruffled fringe, while two black stars have been carefully applied below her eyes, adding to the overall dramatic effect.\" Becky Bain from music website Idolator, commented that although \"Lewis looks beautiful\", the image processing makes her look \"incredibly washed out in this over-saturated photo\"; Bain was less impressed with the star-like beauty marks on her face. A competition run by Lewis' website gave fans the opportunity to be part of the artwork for the deluxe edition of the album. Fans were asked to send in pictures of themselves posing with a heart, for inclusion in the album liner booklet.

The music touches on Celtic melodies, bluesy rock stomps, nods to goth and gospel.\" The Daily Telegraph's Neil McCormick viewed Ceremonials as \"a giant, fluid, emotionally resonant album\" and stated, \"Contrary to the name she has given her band, the Machine feel organic and human, providing an epic, full-blooded soundtrack to Welch's voodoo, in which rhythm, melody and chanting are employed to drive out neuroses and insecurities, characterised as ghosts and devils.\" Rob Harvilla of Spin described Welch as \"a bloodied, bloodying songbird in a gilded cage of immaculately crafted, slow-burn, chest-beating empowerment anthems, gripping steel bars that her elegantly volcanic voice could shred at any moment\", adding, \"She's so much better than her material that her material is rendered immaterial.\"Michael Hann of The Guardian concluded that the album \"always sounds wonderful\u2014producer Paul Epworth has created a warm, soft, four-poster featherbed of sound for Welch to emote over\u2014but it never really satisfies. One yearns for Welch's wonderful voice to be delivering lines of more import than the nonsense she's often delivering here.\" In a mixed review, Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole wrote that \"[t]he first four tracks of Ceremonials are essentially flawless\", but felt that the album \"can't help but get weaker as it continues, a fact which owes less to the quality of the songwriting than to the album's length [...] and a far less dynamic second act.\" Andy Gill of The Independent expressed, \"[I]n cementing one style, some of the possibilities offered by Lungs have been choked off. The only time [Welch] and The Machine stray from the formula is the Krautrock-disco motorik of 'Spectrum'; elsewhere, declamatory piano chords and burring organ underpin the banked, soaring vocals that are her trademark\". Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal argued, \"Instead of Lungs' largely charming yet discombobulating diversity, Ceremonials suffers from a repetitiveness that's akin to looking at a skyline filled with 100-story behemoths lined-up one after the other, blocking out everything but their own size.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54395", "text": "The cover artwork for Ceremonials was photographed by Florence and the Machine's longtime collaborator Tom Beard.

The album is the follow-up to her successful debut album, Thankful (2003). Breakaway sees Clarkson collaborating with various producers and songwriters for the first time, primarily Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, Ben Moody, and David Hodges; the latter two are former members of American rock band Evanescence. Despite the established commercial success of Thankful, music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an American Idol winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she was convinced by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, in pursuit of a pop rock direction. This also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release. Breakaway is primarily a pop rock record with elements of rock and soul music, marking a departure from the R&B-oriented sound of Thankful; its lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism.\nBreakaway received a positive response from music critics, with many commending the album's new-found pop rock sound and Clarkson's vocal performances. It received several awards and nominations, including winning two Grammy Awards and receiving a nomination for a Juno Award. The album became a commercial success worldwide. By selling over 12 million copies worldwide, Breakaway is Clarkson's best selling album of her career so far, and one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. After debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 in the United States, it stayed on the top twenty of the chart for more than a year, eventually being certified 6\u00d7 multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of more than six million copies.\nBreakaway's singles \"Since U Been Gone\", \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", \"Because of You\", \"Walk Away\", and \"Breakaway\" became worldwide hits and have become some of Clarkson's signature songs. Their successes prompted Billboard to credit her for landscaping the core sound of mainstream pop music as an uptempo dance-oriented sound in the 2000s. Furthermore, Breakaway established Clarkson as one of the four highest-selling acts of Sony BMG in the 2000s. Internationally, the album topped the music charts of Ireland and the Netherlands and became the world's 7th biggest-selling release of 2005, eventually being certified platinum in over 17 countries. To promote the album, Clarkson embarked on three international concert tours from 2005 to 2006: the Breakaway Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and the Addicted Tour. Billboard placed the album 77th in  the Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_54457", "text": "In early 2004, Clarkson began working on new material for her second studio album, which followed her successful debut album Thankful (2003), while co-headlining the Independent Tour with Clay Aiken, the runner-up from the second season of American Idol. She had also expressed intentions to record with Fantasia Barrino, who had then just won the series' third season; both were expected to release their albums in the same month.As she began to work for the album with music executive Clive Davis, Clarkson was invited by Whitney Houston to record the song \"Breakaway\", which would be included for the soundtrack of the 2004 Walt Disney Pictures feature film The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, which Houston had co-produced. The song, written by Matthew Gerrard, Bridget Benenate, and Avril Lavigne, was initially written for Lavigne's debut album Let Go (2002) but deemed unsuitable for the album's themes at the time. Initially reluctant, Clarkson agreed to record the song. \"Breakaway\" was first released in July 2004 by Walt Disney Records as a single from the soundtrack, acting as an interim record until her second album's lead single was released. After debuting on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 60, it peaked at number six, a week before the album's release.In April 2004, Clarkson entered the studio immediately after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, \"I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's some people who have some stuff for me. I'm not one of those people who thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it.\" During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, \"I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material.\" Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a d\u00e9tente\u2014she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, \"I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone.\" In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, \"I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore,\" Clarkson said. \"I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing ... so it worked out perfectly.\" Moody recalled, \"It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently.\"Worried of Clarkson being continually typecast as a talent show winner, Davis met with various producers, primarily Max Martin, and encouraged them to produce records for Clarkson in a pop rock direction. Clarkson revealed that she expected that she'll always be labeled as an American Idol winner; she remarked, \"I'm the first one, so it's going to be on my grave, I'm aware of that. (There's no getting away from it) so why even try?\" Upon their meeting, Martin presented songs he wrote with Dr. Luke. These songs include \"Since U Been Gone\" and a demo version of what would have been \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\". Davis wanted Clarkson to record the songs, describing them having \"a sharp rock edge but were still capable of being pop hits. They would push Kelly in a promising direction for her, while maintaining and even growing her audience.\" Martin insisted that the songs should be given to rock acts, wanting to stray from his reputation for producing pop singles for the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears in the 1990s. Davis recalled, \"Max was looking to move on from what he had done with Backstreet Boys, and I really spent time convincing them that an American Idol winner could bring all the feeling and passion that was required to the song.\" Martin and Dr. Luke eventually agreed and invited Clarkson to travel to Sweden to record the songs. Upon hearing the tracks, Clarkson was skeptical of the pop elements; and the three eventually decided to develop a rock sound, a move Clarkson claimed Davis did not approve. Davis reiterated that he was ecstatic with the prospect, claiming that she disliked it and demanded that both the songs be removed from the album. Clarkson then asserted that she wanted it to be on the record and claimed that Davis had detested \"Because of You\" instead, saying that she \"was a shitty writer (sic) who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon her\". Davis reiterated that he loved the song and felt that Clarkson could indeed write hits.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54458", "text": "Wanting to stray away from the R&B-styled music of Thankful, which she described as a showcase of versatility, she revealed that Thankful's success \"empowered me to step more into rock, step more into the soulful vibe.\" She described the music of the second album as \"like the first CD in the sense that it's versatile, but it's more into the rock, It's more into the soulful roots, and it's just a little bit deeper, so it's pretty cool.\" Dr. Luke revealed in an interview that alternative music and indie music were inspirations to \"Since U Been Gone\", saying, \"That was a conscious move by Max [Martin] and myself, because we were listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song-I don't remember what it was. I said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?' It worked.\" Songs such as \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", and \"Because of You\" were also inspired by her real life experiences, the former about her relationship with an ex-boyfriend and the latter about her experience after her parents' divorce.Clarkson shares writing credits on six songs from Breakaway. \"Breakaway\" was included as the album's opening and title track. She described it as a simple song, and further explained, \"I think that its simplicity is what's beautiful about it. Whenever writers or producers come to work with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice. I've done country music, I've done pop, I've done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different. But this song was different from everything I've done; people didn't even know it was me!\" Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track \"Since U Been Gone\", as \"not as \"smooth\" as pop or R&B. Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, \"It's very emotional. Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live.\" Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, \"I wrote 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' about my last boyfriend. It's the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn't make the deadline.\" The fourth track, \"Because of You\", was originally intended for Thankful. Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. \"Gone\", the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, \"Addicted\", was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album Fallen (2003). She remarked, \"I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. And then I heard that Evanescence record ... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.Clarkson co-wrote the seventh track, \"Where Is Your Heart\", with DioGuardi and Chantal Kreviazuk. She revealed that it was also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as \"wanting to get really into our relationship, and I just thought, 'Where are you in our relationship?'\" \"Walk Away\", the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as \"one of the brighter songs\" on Breakaway, and said that \"It's very blunt and to the point. 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'\" DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, \"You Found Me\". Clarkson revealed, \"When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting at the time that I recorded it.\" DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, \"I Hate Myself for Losing You\", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as \"depressing\", but felt it could be used as a foreshadowing device. She explained \"I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out.\" The eleventh track, \"Hear Me\", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, \"The song is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'\" The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of \"Beautiful Disaster\", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankful's version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54459", "text": "Breakaway was first released in North America on November 30, 2004, by RCA Records, 19 Recordings, and S Records, following an influx of releases by American Idol contestants Clay Aiken, Ruben Studdard, and Fantasia Barrino. The New York Times columnist Jeff Leeds noted that the releases could benefit from the holiday season, but \"it could also hinder their efforts to establish themselves as recording artists with distinctive personalities and the legitimacy needed for long careers.\" Clive Davis reiterated that the release was intended to recede from their ties from American Idol, saying, \"I'm not interested in merely souvenir sales\". The album was titled Breakaway to capitalize on the success of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement soundtrack single \"Breakaway\", which was also reissued as the album's final single. Immediately before the album was released, Clarkson left 19 Management, dismissed Fuller as her manager, and quickly hired the managing services of Jeff Kwatinetz of The Firm, though still contracted to 19 Recordings. A promotion plan was created for Clarkson for Breakaway's release. Davis positioned her to be RCA's top global priority, and at the recommendation of The Firm, removed American Idol from her official biography. Rather than being booked on arenas for her tour, Kwatinetz booked Clarkson for smaller amphitheaters to hone her performance skills. He remarked, \"American Idol gave her a lot of exposure that allowed her to skip some steps in her development, and that's hazardous.\" Breakaway was first released internationally on January 3, 2005, by the Bertelsmann Music Group (now Sony Music Entertainment), and was released in the United Kingdom on July 18, 2005, by RCA.

On the eve of Breakaway's release, she performed \"Since U Been Gone\" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. In February 2005, she appeared on Saturday Night Live to perform \"Since U Been Gone\" and \"Breakaway\". In September 2005, she appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and performed \"Breakaway\" as well as \"Because of You\". Clarkson also performed in award ceremonies and events; she performed \"Since U Been Gone\" on the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards at the American Airlines Arena and on the Brit Awards 2006 at the Earls Court. She performed \"Because of You\" on the 48th Annual Grammy Awards at the Staples Center and on the 15th Echo Awards at the Estrel Hotel.From 2005 to 2006, Clarkson embarked on three concert tours to promote Breakaway: the Breakaway Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and the Addicted Tour. The Breakaway Tour, which took place before, in between and after the Hazel Eyes Tour, marked Clarkson's first world tour, visiting theaters and arenas throughout North America, Europe and Oceania.

A different Cliks lineup, consisting of Silveira, bassist Ezri Kaysen and drummer Heidi Chan, released an eponymous debut album in 2004. In Toronto's NOW, reviewer Sarah Liss described the band's music as \"what might happen if Chrissie Hynde and the Murmurs' Leisha Hailey fell in love, got Bowie to help out with insemination and gave birth to an indie rock love child.\"However, the original lineup broke up in 2005. This precipitated a difficult period for lead singer and guitarist Lucas Silveira:\n\nI was in a six-and-a-half year relationship that came to a really, really messy end. After the breakup, both of my band members quit. It was hard to take, because I was falling back on the music to take me to a place where I could keep myself going. My father had a stroke. My grandmother died. A friend of mine got rediagnosed with cancer after being cancer-free for four months. It was just one thing after another. I also started coming to terms with a lot of identity issues, being transgender and all this stuff. I had a huge breakdown and decided I was either going to get through it or I wasn't.\nThe first album predated Silveira's gender transition. Silveira later worked with Morgan Doctor and Jordan B. Wright to record Snakehouse. Wright left the band shortly after the album was completed and was replaced by Jen Benton on bass.  Martinez was added as the second guitarist.\nThe breakthrough lineup of the band were all out members of the LGBT community.

The original lineup reformed in 2005, releasing five albums thereafter.Mascis's drawling vocals and distinct guitar sound, hearkening back to 1960s and 1970s classic rock and characterized by extensive use of feedback and distortion, were highly influential in the alternative rock movement of the 1990s.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_54486", "text": "Dinosaur Jr has been described as alternative rock indie rock, noise rock, hardcore punk (first albums) and grunge (early nineties).\n\nDinosaur Jr. is considered to be an alternative rock band; however, the band's musical style, compared to its underground contemporaries in the 1980s, differed in several ways. This included the influence of classic rock on the band's music, their use of feedback, extreme volume as well as loud-quiet dynamic, combined with Mascis's droning vocals. A characteristic of Mascis's vocal style is frequent use of vocal fry. Gerald Cosloy, head of Homestead Records, summarized the band's music: \"It was its own bizarre hybrid. ... It wasn't exactly pop, it wasn't exactly punk rock\u2014it was completely its own thing\".Mascis listened to classic rock artists such as the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, elements of which were incorporated into Dinosaur Jr.'s sound. In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as The Birthday Party, and has frequently noted Nick Cave as an influence. Dinosaur Jr. combined elements of hardcore punk and noise rock into their songs, which often featured a large amount of feedback, distortion and extreme volume. When the master tape of You're Living All Over Me arrived at SST, the label's production manager noticed the level on the tape was so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed it was the way he wanted the album to sound.Similar to Mascis's guitar work, Barlow's bass lines with their alternating heavily distorted, fast chords and pulverizing lows, draw heavily from both his hardcore past and musicians such as Lemmy and Johnny Ramone. On his influences, Barlow stated that \"...Johnny Ramone is my hero. I wanted to make that rhythmic chugging sound like he got playing guitar with the Ramones. And, I found that I got a bigger sound by strumming farther up the neck.\"Mascis's vocals are another distinctive feature of Dinosaur Jr.'s music. He attributed his \"whiny low-key drawl\", the opposite of the hardcore punk \"bark\", to artists such as John Fogerty and Mick Jagger. His style also resembled Neil Young's, but Mascis disputed this and later commented: \"That got annoying, being compared all the time.\" His drawl epitomized the band's slacker ethos and relaxed attitude; author Michael Azerrad said \"even Mascis seemed removed from the feelings he was conveying in the music.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54487", "text": "In a BBC review of their reissued albums You're Living All Over Me and Bug, Zoe Street called them \"Frighteningly ahead of their time.\" The Seattle Times called them \"one of post-punk\u2019s most influential bands.\" According to Michael Azerrad:Dinosaur Jr was one of the first, biggest, and best bands among the second generation of indie kids, the ones who took Black Flag and Minor Threat for granted, a generation for whom the Seventies, not the Sixties, was the nostalgic ideal. Their music continued a retrograde stylistic shift in the American underground that the Replacements and other bands had begun: renouncing the antihistorical tendencies of hardcore and fully embracing the music that everyone had grown up on. In particular, Dinosaur singer-guitarist J Mascis achieved the unthinkable in underground rock\u2014he brought back the extended guitar solo.Dinosaur Jr's music has influenced many other musicians such as Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins, Black Francis of Pixies, Radiohead, Graham Coxon of Blur, Doug Martsch of Built to Spill, Henry Rollins, Tad, Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Slowdive, Aidan Moffat of Arab Strap, Swervedriver, Uncle Tupelo, Teenage Fanclub, The Lemonheads, Tom DeLonge of Blink-182, Snow Patrol, Band of Horses, Polvo, and Kurt Vile.Their album You're Living All Over Me has been called \"the first perfect indie rock album.\" Spin named it one of \"The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985\u20132014)\".

The only full-out dance-pop song on the album is \"Your Love\", and on the deluxe version, \"Cold World\". The rest of the songs are a mix of \"urban\" pop, R&B, soul, and even some experimental PBR&B on the song \"Heartbreaker\".

The song \"Bang\" was compared to the work of Ciara, specifically her Basic Instinct album (2010), which both The-Dream and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart also produced. \"Just a Girl\" is a \"throwback to 90's R&B\" with its production. \"Girl With a Diamond Heart\" mixes dance-pop and R&B. \"First Time\" is features a more traditional pop and R&B sound. \"Little Boy\" is a soulful ballad that is mostly free of a beat to put the focus on Nicole's vocals and lyrics.

After Life After Death, Puff Daddy's Bad Boy Records continued to bring pop and gangsta rap closer together: the references to violence and drug dealing remained, as did the \"gangsta\" rhetoric, but the previously dark production changed to a cleaner, sample-heavy, more upbeat sound that was fashioned for the pop charts, as seen in the single \"Mo Money Mo Problems\". The Notorious B.I.G. is often credited with initiating this transition, as he was among the first mainstream rappers to produce albums with a calculated attempt to include both gritty and realistic gangsta narratives as well as radio-friendly productions.\n\n\"It sounded for the first time like an East Coast artist had been able to make the perfect record. It was a pop record, a radio record, a street record, a club record. It embodied every type of song that a hip-hop artist could make \u2013 would wish to make, would try to make \u2013 in one project.

However, notable hip-hop producers such as Easy Mo Bee, Havoc from Mobb Deep, DJ Premier and RZA from Wu-Tang Clan contributed beats.\nVarious artists were specifically influenced by songs on Life After Death. Evidence's \"Down in New York City\" is essentially \"Going Back to Cali\" from the perspective of a West Coast hip hop artist. Jay-Z borrows four bars from \"The World Is Filled...\" in his song \"I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)\", as well as the chorus from his song \"Squeeze first\" from \"Hypnotize\", a line in \"The Ruler's Back\" from \"Kick in the Door\" and \"You're Nobody ('Til Somebody Kills You)\" on \"D.O.A.

The official remix includes a verse from B.I.G. that originally appeared on \"I Love the Dough\". SWV sampled \"Ten Crack Commandments\" on the opening track \"Someone\" featuring B.I.G.'s former protege and friend Puff Daddy.

It appeared in the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire and on its soundtrack album. The song samples English rock band the Clash's 1982 song \"Straight to Hell\", leading to its members being credited as co-writers. A downtempo alternative hip hop, pop track combining African folk music elements, the song has a less dance-oriented sound compared to other songs on the album. Its lyrics, inspired by M.I.A.'s own problems obtaining a visa to work in the USA, satirise American perceptions of immigrants from Third World nations.Its accompanying music video, filmed in Bedford-Stuyvesant, depicts M.I.A. as an undercover dealer and features images of paper planes flying overhead. While the video proved popular on MTV, the network censored the song's cannabis reference and gunshot sounds.

It won awards from the Canadian Independent Music Awards and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), and earned a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year.

While M.I.A. wanted to work with American producer Timbaland for Arular's follow-up album Kala (2007), her application for a long-term US work visa was rejected. This was allegedly due to her family's connection to the Tamil guerrillas, commonly known as the Tamil Tigers, a claim M.I.A. denied. Her visa problems were also attributed to her criticism of the Sri Lankan government's discrimination and alleged atrocities committed against the Tamils, with whom M.I.A. shares an ethnic and cultural heritage. She expressed this on her politicised album Arular.M.I.A. began work on \"Paper Planes\" with American producer Diplo and English DJ Switch in London. The track's downtempo production sets it apart from the rest of Kala, which features dense electronic sounds. Diplo came up with the idea of sampling English rock band the Clash's 1982 song \"Straight to Hell\" and produced the instrumental track with assistance from Switch. As a result, all members of the Clash were credited as co-writers. M.I.A. said that she recorded her vocals without paying much attention to her singing and finished the song in one take. She drew inspiration for the lyrics from her own troubles gaining a work permit to the US, complaining that the issue was probably \"them thinking that I might to [sic] fly a plane into the Trade Center\".

After regaining entry to the US, M.I.A. finalised the track at her home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a Brooklyn neighbourhood with a high concentration of African Americans, in mid-2007. She recalled that her time living there prompted her to think, \"People don't really feel like immigrants or refugees contribute to culture in any way\". She added the sound effects of gunshots and a cash register to the chorus. Saying these sounds symbolise stereotypes of immigrants, M.I.A. refused to elaborate and wanted listeners to interpret the song for themselves noting, \"America is so obsessed with money, I'm sure they'll get it\". She told The Daily Beast that the gunshots embodied political refugees' experiences in war-torn areas, which she described as \"a part of our culture as an everyday thing\".

Byzantine wrote four songs, then seven more songs were written, and 2000\u20132001 Demos was recorded and self-released in 2001. Soon after, Byzantine became a part of the local West Virginian heavy metal scene.Subsequently, the band recruited local musician Matt Wolfe as a drummer. Ten songs featuring Wolfe were recorded in 2003 at Broadmoor Studios in Huntington, West Virginia and were released as The Broadmoor Demo, arousing the interest of Lamb of God's drummer Chris Adler. Byzantine then had a short East Coast tour with Lamb of God. This tour helped them obtain new fans and a deal with Prosthetic Records.Soon after Byzantine released their debut album The Fundamental Component in February 2004, which introduced the band's trademark sound. Subsequently, Byzantine toured with Lamb of God and Shadows Fall as well as playing the main stage of New England Metal and Hardcore Festival in 2004 (and later in 2006). Chris \"Cid\" Adams was soon fired, and Byzantine returned to the studio to record their second album in 2005: ...And They Shall Take Up Serpents, with Tony Rohrbough taking over bass duties in the studio. The album received high praise both abroad and domestically.A 2007 fan-oriented DVD titled Salvation, featuring exclusive material, scenes, in-studio clips, interviews, the uncut version of the \"Jeremiad\" music video and the performance of the never-before released \"Cradle Song\", increased the band's popularity.

During World War II, he worked in the Army's V-disc operation, which made records for radio broadcast and for personal use by army personnel.In 1945, he became head of the country division in Nashville, Tennessee, and was responsible for recruiting such talent as Chet Atkins for RCA Victor. When he left Nashville, Atkins took over as head of the country music division. In the 1940s Sholes signed Eddy Arnold, The Browns, Hank Locklin, Homer and Jethro, Hank Snow, Jim Reeves, and Pee Wee King. In 1955, he signed Elvis Presley to RCA Victor. He eventually had fifteen chart topping hit singles in the UK as a  record producer for Presley.  In 1982 he reached fourth place on the list of most successful record producers on the UK charts.In 1957, Sholes convinced RCA to build its own recording studio in Nashville on Seventeenth Avenue South; this would become RCA Studio B. The same year, he became the company's pop singles manager, then pop singles and albums manager in 1958, and West Coast manager in 1961. The latter promotion took him to Los Angeles, California. In 1963, Sholes became RCA Victor vice president for pop A&R and returned to New York.\nHe served on the Country Music Association (CMA) and Country Music Foundation (CMF) boards of directors. Sholes was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, which he had worked to create, in 1967.Sholes died in Nashville of a heart attack at the age of 57.

During the five decades of his music career he has recorded 16 studio albums and collections, and 6 live albums. He is also a writer, having published autobiographic and noir novels, and a comics writer. Guccini also worked as actor, soundtrack composer, lexicographer and dialectologist.\nGuccini moved to P\u00e0vana during World War II, then returned to Modena where he spent his teenage years and established his musical career. His debut album, Folk beat n. 1, was released in 1967, but the first success was in 1972 with the album Radici. He was harshly criticised after releasing Stanze di vita quotidiana, and answered his critics with the song \"L'avvelenata\". His studio albums production slowed down in the nineties and 2000s, but his live performances continued being successful.\nHis lyrics have been praised for their poetic and literary value and have been used in schools as an example of modern poetry. Guccini has gained the appreciation of critics and fans, who regard him as an iconic figure. He has received several awards for his works; an asteroid, a cactus species and a butterfly subspecies have been named after him. The main instrument in most of his songs is the acoustic guitar.\nA leftist, though not a communist, Guccini dealt with political issues and more generally with the political climate of his time in some songs, such as \"La locomotiva\" or \"Eskimo\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_54729", "text": "Guccini was born in 1940 in Modena, Italy. His father from Tuscany, Ferruccio Guccini, was a postal employee, and his mother from Emilia, Ester Prandi, was a housewife. While his father served in the Italian military during World War II, Guccini lived with his grandparents in a small village in the Apennine Mountains in northern Tuscany called P\u00e0vana, where he spent his childhood. His years spent in the somewhat archaic society of the mountains of Central Italy was to be a strong inspiration throughout his career, and it became one of the key recurring themes of his songs and books.When World War II had ended, Guccini moved back to his family in Modena. He studied at the Istituto Magistrale Carlo Sigonio, the same school Luciano Pavarotti had attended, earning his high school diploma in 1958. Guccini spent his teenage years in Modena, as he later recounted in his second novel Vacca d'un Cane and in songs including \"Piccola Citt\u00e0\", which paints a bitter portrait of the city as \"a strange enemy\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54730", "text": "Guccini's first job was as a teacher at a boarding school in Pesaro, but he was fired after a month and a half. He then worked as a journalist at the Gazzetta di Modena for two years. In April 1960, Guccini interviewed Domenico Modugno, who had just won two consecutive Sanremo Festivals. This inspired Guccini to write \"L'antisociale\", his first composition as a singer-songwriter.\nIn 1958 Guccini was guitarist and vocalist in a group first called Hurricanes, then Snakers and finally Gatti. The group included Pier Farri (drums), who would later become Guccini's producer; Victor Sogliani (saxophone), future member of Equipe 84; and Franco Fini Storchi (guitar). Guccini wrote his first songs while in the Snakers, in a style inspired by The Everly Brothers and Peppino di Capri. The group performed for two years, touring around Northern Italy and Switzerland. In 1961 the Guccini family moved to Bologna, and Francesco enrolled at the University of Bologna to study foreign languages. The next year he undertook mandatory military service, an experience he described as \"substantially positive\". When he returned to Bologna, Guccini was asked to join the band Equipe 84, but he declined to continue his studies. He later quit university just before taking his degree (he was conferred a degree honoris causa in science education in 2002). The band Cantacronache was an important influence in Guccini's artistic growth, as was Bob Dylan.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54731", "text": "Record Producer CGD commissioned Guccini to write a song for the 1967 Sanremo Festival, \"Una storia d'amore\", to be sung by Caterina Caselli and Gigliola Cinquetti at . The song, though, was not selected for the event, and Guccini was embittered by the edits made by two lyricists engaged by CGD.\nGuccini made his debut as a singer-songwriter in March 1967, with the album Folk beat n. 1, which received little commercial success. Three of the songs recorded for the album had previously been successes for Nomadi and Equipe 84: \"Noi non-ci saremo\", \"L'antisociale\" and \"Auschwitz\". The latter was translated and sung in English by Equipe 84, as well as by Rod MacDonald in his 1994 album Man on the Ledge. Another song from the album, \"In morte di S.F.\", later renamed \"Canzone per un'amica\", was recorded by Nomadi in 1968.  From 1965 onward, Guccini spent 20 years teaching Italian at the off-campus Dickinson College, in Bologna.In May 1967 Guccini made his first appearance in television, on Diamoci del tu, hosted by Caterina Caselli and Giorgio Gaber singing \"Auschwitz\". He wrote several songs for Caselli and for Nomadi, who made his song \"Dio \u00e8 morto\" become widely popular; it became one of his most famous songs, despite being censored by the RAI for blasphemy. In 1968 Francesco Guccini translated Simon & Garfunkel's hit song \"Mrs. Robinson\" into Italian; it was first covered in this version by the Italian beat group I Royals and later was recorded by Bobby Solo on his LP Bobby Folk in 1970. In 1968 the 45 rpm record Un altro giorno \u00e8 andato/Il bello was released; Guccini re-recorded the Side A song in an acoustic version for his 1970 album L'isola non-trovata. His first concert was held the same year at the La Cittadella Cultural Centre in Assisi.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54732", "text": "In 1970 Guccini released his second album, Due anni dopo, recorded in the autumn of 1969. The main themes of the album are the passage of time and the analysis of everyday life in the context of bourgeois hypocrisy, with a noticeable influence from French music and from Leopardi's poetic style. After this album Guccini started his 10-year-long collaboration with folksinger Deborah Kooperman, who played fingerstyle guitar on it, a style mostly unknown in Italy at the time. Eleven months after Due anni dopo, the album L'isola non trovata was released. The title was a literary reference to Guido Gozzano, and the song \"La collina\" contained a reference to J. D. Salinger. Guccini's fame began to spread beyond Bologna, partly thanks to the appearance in the TV show Speciale tre milioni, where he sang some of his songs and befriended Claudio Baglioni. In 1971 he married his long-time girlfriend Roberta Baccilieri, who was pictured on the back cover of his next album.The turning point in Guccini's career was in 1972 thanks to the album Radici (roots), about the perpetual search for one's origins. This was also conveyed by the image on the front cover of the album, portraying Guccini's grandparents and their siblings next to their old mountain home. Radici contains some of his most renowned and popular songs, like \"Incontro\", \"Piccola Citt\u00e0\", \"Il vecchio e il bambino\", \"La Canzone della bambina portoghese\", \"Canzone dei dodici mesi\", and \"La locomotiva\", based on a real event and dealing with themes of equality, social justice and freedom, with a style similar to the anarchic music of the end of the 19th century. In the same year Guccini brought Claudio Lolli, a young singer-songwriter, to his record label, EMI Italiana. He later wrote two songs with him, \"Keaton\" and \"Ballando con una sconosciuta\".\nIn 1973 Guccini released Opera buffa, a light-hearted and playful album, which showed his skills as an ironic, theatrical and cultured cabaret artist. Guccini was perplexed by the release of the disc, especially because of its arrangements and because it was recorded live (with overdubs made in a recording studio). One year later Stanze di vita quotidiana was released, with a mixed reception by fans and critics. It included six long and melancholic songs, a mirror of the crisis Guccini faced, worsened by constant disagreements with his producer Pier Farri. Guccini received harsh criticism, including a slating by the critic Riccardo Bertoncelli, who said the singer songwriter was \"a finished artist, who has nothing else to say\". Guccini answered with the song \"L'avvelenata\", a few years later.\nGuccini had his first commercial success in 1976, with Via Paolo Fabbri 43, which was the sixth best-selling album of the year. It was named after the address of the house in Bologna where he lived. He sang with a more mature and determined voice, and the musical structure was more complex than in his earlier works. The album contained \"L'avvelenata\", a bitter and colourful reply to the criticism he received for Stanze di vita quotidiana, which cited one of his critics, Riccardo Bertoncelli. Later Guccini was reluctant in performing the song during concerts, saying it was obsolete. \nThe title track was an abstract description of Guccini's life in Bologna, which referenced Borges and Barthes; it also mentioned the \"three heroines of Italian song\", Alice, Marinella and Lilly, three women from songs by Italian singer-songwriters De Gregori, De Andr\u00e9 and Venditti. Other notable tracks were \"Canzone quasi d'Amore\", characterised by existential poetry, and \"Il pensionato\", about an old neighbour of Guccini, focusing on the sad psychological situation of some old people. Guccini's next album, Amerigo was released in 1978. The most popular song was \"Eskimo\", but Guccini claimed the highest point was the title track, a ballad about an emigrant uncle of his.\nIn 1977 the weekly magazine Grand Hotel featured Guccini on the cover titled \"The father every teenager would have liked to have\". Guccini did not endorse the article, which was based on an interview he did not know would be published, and commented: \"I cannot understand how they chose that title, I write songs for an audience of people in their thirties, I do not see how an audience of sixteen year olds fresh out of school could relate with the things I say\". In the same year, Guccini separated from his wife Roberta (the song \"Eskimo\" is about this event), and started cohabitating with Angela. In 1978 they had a daughter, Teresa, to whom the songs \"Culodritto\" and \"E un giorno...\" are dedicated. In 1979 the live album Album concerto, recorded in a concert with Nomadi, was released. It was peculiar because the songs were performed in duet with Augusto Daolio, and because it included previously unreleased songs: \"Dio \u00e8 morto\", \"Noi\", and \"Per fare un uomo\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

A beautiful balance of energy, momentum, and melody, Canvas announces the arrival of a new keyboard star-in-the-making, and a burning new trio. Wonderful stuff\".In The Guardian, John Fordham observed \"Robert Glasper is a 26-year-old Houston-born piano virtuoso with a light, dancing touch.  ... On the face of it, Canvas sounds like the work of just another mostly-acoustic keyboard threesome in a jazz landscape teeming with such outfits. Glasper applies wistful Bill Evans chords to softly waltzing ballads. He fuels uptempo pieces with taut and shapely bursts of Hancockish virtuosity and adopts a gently rocking lyricism along the lines of Jarrett and Mehldau here and there. ... The originals are by no means as striking as the playing, but you can hear why Blue Note has hopes for this newcomer, who is steeped in tradition yet audibly contemporary\".In JazzTimes, David R. Adler wrote \"Canvas situates Glasper to full advantage. ... All the tracks but \u201cRiot\u201d are originals, although Glasper's take on Hancock stands out as an artistic centerpiece. Playing Rhodes as well as piano, he takes a seemingly inconsequential snippet of the melody and loops it as a five-bar phrase for soloing. As an example of sonic and formal creativity, this is a stunner. But it's also a window into Glasper's emerging sound, in which advanced jazz lines, neosoul cadences and hints of hip-hop rhythm all play a role.\".On PopMatters, Robert R. Calder was less positive noting \"This is on the whole a disappointing set, the fault probably being Blue Note's, for not getting more variety from this undoubtedly extraordinarily able young pianist from Texas ... The tendency here is to play a chorus, followed by a chorus, followed by a chorus, and round and round it goes, even if the time signature's changing.

Some fans and critics expressed their disappointment at the album's length, stating that a playing time of 26 minutes was not sufficient for a full-length album and that they had expected more creative output from the band. By this time, however, the band's members had drifted heavily into other projects (most notably singer/guitarist John Reis, who was simultaneously playing in Hot Snakes and Sultans and running his record label Swami Records) and were not as creatively dedicated to Rocket as they had been in the past. Cryptic liner notes written by Long Gone John seemed to indicate that the album was a \"last gasp\" of a band in turmoil and that it might be their final album.\nTouring in support of Live from Camp X-Ray was sparse due to the band members' commitments to other projects, and they would perform infrequently over the next few years. In August 2005, after breaking up Hot Snakes, Reis announced that Rocket from the Crypt would play their final performance on Halloween of that year. This confirmed suspicions that Live from Camp X-Ray was the band's final studio album, though posthumous releases of material recorded before their breakup have since been released.\n\"Bring Us Bullets\" is notable for being featured in the film Crank.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_54774", "text": "\"I'm Not Invisible\"\n\"Get Down\"\n\"I Can't Feel My Head\"\n\"Can You Hear It?\"\n\"I Wanna Know What I Wanna Know\"\n\"Bring Us Bullets\"\n\"Bucket of Piss\"\n\"Dumb Blind and Horny\"\n\"Outsider\"\n\"Too Many Balls\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54775", "text": "Speedo (John Reis) \u2013 guitar, lead vocals\nND (Andy Stamets) \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nPetey X (Pete Reichert) \u2013 bass, backing vocals\nApollo 9 (Paul O'Beirne) - saxophone, percussion, backing vocals\nJC 2000 (Jason Crane) - trumpet, percussion, backing vocals\nRuby Mars (Mario Rubalcaba) \u2013 drums\nAnne Zarkus, Wes Tudor, Jason Greenworld, Patricia McLurmick, Santa Peuraro, Kara Richardson, Brianna Lotes, and Evelyn Cooperman \u2013 strings on \"Can You Hear It?\" and \"I Wanna Know What I Wanna Know\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54776", "text": "Record label: Vagrant Records\nProduced by John Reis\nRecorded at Drag Racist studios in San Diego Summer 2002 by John Reis, Dave Gardner and Ben Moore\nMixed by Ben Moore at Big Fish Recorders with assistance by Jason Clark\nMastered by Eddy Schreyer\nArtwork by Yannick Desfanleau and Chloe Lum\nAdditional layout and design by Joby J.

Steve Huey of AllMusic said the songwriting on the album \"takes a quantum leap in focus and consistency\", adding: \"It's surprisingly cerebral and arty music for a band courting mainstream metal audiences, but it attacks with scientific precision.\" Guitarist Kim Thayil jokingly called it the \"Heavy Metal White Album\". Frontman Chris Cornell said, \"I think there's songs on the new record which are almost more commercially viable because they have that memorable feel to them, and I think if anyone expected us to come out and make something more commercial than Louder Than Love [the band's previous album], then I'm glad that they were surprised.\" He added that the album was more representative of how the band was live.Compared with Louder Than Love, the band took a more collaborative approach to the writing process for Badmotorfinger. It was Soundgarden's first album with bassist Ben Shepherd, who replaced Jason Everman in April 1990, and Cornell said Shepherd brought a \"fresh and creative\" approach to the recording sessions, while the band as a whole said his knowledge of music and writing skills redefined the group. Before joining, Soundgarden had been Shepherd's favorite band. Shepherd contributed the song \"Somewhere\" and collaborated on the musical composition of several other songs on the album, as did Thayil and drummer Matt Cameron. Thayil said Shepherd's contributions helped make the album \"faster\" and \"weirder\".Several of the album's songs utilize alternative tunings, such as \"Rusty Cage\", \"Searching with My Good Eye Closed\", and \"Holy Water\" (on all of which the bottom E string of the guitars is tuned down to B), and \"Mind Riot\" (on which every string is tuned to one of several octaves of E). There are also some unusual time signatures on the album, \"Outshined\" is partially in 7/4 and \"Face Pollution\" is in 9/8. Thayil was quoted as saying he didn't \"push for weird time signatures\", but rather \"push[ed] to get the quirkiness out of things\".Regarding the lyrics, Cornell said he tried to not get too specific and was more interested in letting ambiguity \"[create] colourful images.\" Thayil compared listening to the album to \"reading a novel [about] man's conflict with himself and society, or the government, or his family, or the economy, or anything.\" Cornell said \"Outshined\" is about going from \"periods of extreme self-confidence\" to \"plummeting in the opposite direction\". \"Jesus Christ Pose\" was written about famous people who exploit the symbol of Jesus' crucifixion to suggest they're persecuted by the public.

Although overshadowed at the time of its release by the sudden popularity of Nevermind, the attention that album brought to the Seattle music scene helped Soundgarden get broader exposure, and Badmotorfinger peaked at number 39 on the Billboard 200 album chart on February 29, 1992. It was among the 100 top selling albums of 1992, sold a million copies in the early 1990s, and was certified platinum by the RIAA in January 1993.The album included the singles \"Jesus Christ Pose\", \"Outshined\", and \"Rusty Cage\", which gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations. The music videos for \"Outshined\" and \"Rusty Cage\" gained considerable airtime on MTV, but the video for \"Jesus Christ Pose\", the album's lead single, was removed from MTV's playlist amidst widespread controversy over the perceived anti-Christian message of the song and video. Promotion of the song also precipitated death threats against the band while they were on tour to support the album in the United Kingdom.In a contemporary review for Spin, Lauren Spencer hailed Badmotorfinger as a \"garden of sound\" that drew on older hard rock influences without sounding \"derivative\". Entertainment Weekly critic Gina Arnold commended Soundgarden for writing more engagingly than their contemporaries, \"who seldom get beyond extolling booze, girls, and cars\". She concluded in her review that the record was more \"stylishly bombastic rather than bludgeoningly bombastic. Tuneless heavy metal is, after all, still tuneless heavy metal, and in that department, Soundgarden are as functional as they make 'em.\" Writing for NME, Keith Cameron said that the band had found \"a cool balance\" between Cornell's \"bluesy screams\" and Thayil's \"brutish riff powerplay\" on Badmotorfinger, rendering the album more \"stripped down, lithe and lethal\" than Louder Than Love. Retrospectively, AllMusic staff-writer Steve Huey deemed Badmotorfinger \"heavy, challenging hard rock full of intellectual sensibility and complex band interplay\", while Ann Powers of Blender commented that \"Cornell strikes the perfect Jesus Christ pose on this sonic wallop\". Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, finding it \"credible\" as a metal record because of Thayil's impressive use of guitar noise, but less impressive lyrically, writing: \"Chris Cornell howls on about 'lookin for the paradigm' and 'your Jesus Christ pose' (I swear, that's the good stuff)\".At the 1992 Grammy Awards, Badmotorfinger received a nomination for Best Metal Performance.

The record begins with \"Elizabeth on the Bathroom Floor\", a sparse piece composed of one of Elizabeth Everett's final diary entries. Later, the album's emotional climax is reached in two tracks: \"Climbing to the Moon\", which draws upon Everett's experiences visiting his sister at a mental health facility shortly before her death; and \"Dead of Winter\", a song about his mother's painful radiation treatment and slow death. The album's last song, \"P.S. You Rock My World\", is a hopeful bookend to \"Elizabeth\", containing subtly humorous lyrics that describe, among other things, an elderly woman at a gas station honking her car at Everett, incorrectly assuming he is the attendant, and his decision that \"maybe it's time to live\".According to the Eels official website, the song \"Baby Genius\" is about Everett's father, a quantum physicist who authored the Many Worlds Theory, although Jim Lang, who helped with the song, believed it was about Eels former bassist, Tommy Walter.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54898", "text": "At the time of the album's recording, the only official Eels members were E himself and drummer Butch Norton, as Tommy Walter had left the band.\nElectro-Shock Blues features guest appearances by T-Bone Burnett, Lisa Germano, Grant Lee Phillips and Jon Brion.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_54899", "text": "Electro-Shock Blues was released September 21, 1998, by record label DreamWorks.

It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by Virgin Records (EMI France). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist Kelly Rowland, who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by Nervo.\nAccording to Rowland, the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album Here I Am (2011), while Guetta noted \"When Love Takes Over\" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds. Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track. Veronica Ferraro mixed the song, focusing primarily on giving Rowland's vocals a magical and inspiring tone. Critics would later state that Rowland's vocals on \"When Love Takes Over\" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist. The song's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other, while the production bears some similarities to Coldplay's 2002 hit single \"Clocks\".\n\"When Love Takes Over\" received universal acclaim. Most noted the addition of Rowland's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from One Love. The song was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries, including in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland. At the time of release, it became Guetta's highest-charting single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Rowland's second number one single in the United Kingdom. \"When Love Takes Over\" ranked at number one on Billboard's Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart. In 2013, Billboard named \"When Love Takes Over\" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time, in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging electronic dance music trend in America at its time of release.\nIn the song's accompanying music video, Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together. It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result. \"When Love Takes Over\" was promoted mainly at award shows, including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards, NRJ Music Awards and the World Music Awards. Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \"When Love Takes Over\" for the annual Miss Universe competition. The single earned several Platinum and Gold certifications, selling over 5.5 million copies worldwide.

While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta at one of his DJ shows in Southern France and commented that \"Listening to him was just crazy.\" Guetta was playing the instrumental version of \"When Love Takes Over\". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, \"I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!\" Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. \"So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song\". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lef\u00e8vre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.Later in a 2010 interview, Nervo revealed that Rowland's record label were not keen on the song despite their and Rowland's enthusiasm. Consequently, \"When Love Takes Over\" was shelved until Guetta rediscovered the song when compiling his fourth studio album, One Love.

However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his One Love album. After getting selected for the album, \"When Love Takes Over\" was given to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final audio mixing of the song. However Riesterer decided to give the track to French mixing engineer Veronica Ferraro, who would later go on to say that \"Reisterer was supposed to mix it, but he wanted me to do it and see how it turned out. The first time I heard the track I immediately knew it would be a huge hit.\" The track was mixed in September 2008, at Ferraro's Super Sonic Scale studio near Paris, the day after her birthday.\nBefore working on the song's individual elements, Ferraro decided that she would focus primarily on Rowland's vocals. \"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric had the right sounds on the drums and the keyboards, so I did not change very much. I just did some standard things, with EQ and compression and things like that. After that my obsession was to get the vocals to sound as good as possible. When I'm mixing a track, I want something to happen, something that takes the listener somewhere. You want the right things in the right place, but it's not a technical issue. It's actually an artistic issue to have everything in the right place \u2013 the mixing has to be magic. It was not difficult in this case, because I knew the song would be a hit, but I did my best to make the vocal sound magical, like an angel singing, so that the hit quality of the song was immediately obvious. I wanted to make sure that the voice takes you from the beginning to the end and doesn't lose you.\"\nFerraro told Sound on Sound that she added a bass drum sample, as she felt that the kick was missing something. \"Rather than equalise it, I added a little bit of my sample to make the BD track sound bigger\". She altered the two piano elements of the song, using the Flex Studio Tool to widen the sound of the piano element without the delay. Additionally, Ferraro used a number of French plug-in software to amplify many of the track's instruments, including the violin, strings and guitar samples. She then moved on to Rowland's vocals, which \"were extensively processed\", including equalization and de-essing. Then upon completion of her work on the song, Ferraro sent \"When Love Takes Over\" to her husband, Bruno Gruel, and his Elektra Mastering Suite.

David Jefferes of Allmusic gave the song a thumbs up saying, calling \"When Love Takes Over\" one of the strongest songs from One Love and praising the \"[addition of] the powerful voice of Kelly Rowland for one grand, uplifting floor-filler.\" Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly agreed calling the song the \"most memorable from the album\" and recalling \"Clocks\" by Coldplay to make \"a showstopper starring Kelly Rowland.\" Michael Hibbard of MusicOMH was impressed with both the production and vocal work on \"When Love Takes Over\". He pointed out the rarity in the amount of promotion given to the song, referring to \"When Love Takes Over\" being given \"its own poster on the Tube.\"  He also described the song as a \"euphoric masterpiece\" backed by \"at least eight remixes \" and the accompany vocals from \"Destiny's Child songbird Kelly Rowland on hand for a diva masterclass.\" Also agreeing with these comments was Fraser McAlpine from BBC Online who awarded the song four out of five stars. \"The genius ingredients include a thinly reworked go at the piano riff to 'Clocks' by Coldplay and handclaps ...

Other elements of the song such as the \"bed of synthistrings, a skippy beat, a breakdown, some riffing glassy electronics and a dramatic, cinematic bottom end drone\" were praised. McAlpine also praised Rowland's appearance on the track, commenting who she sounded \"entirely unlike herself, so that even SHE is all buffed up and shiny.\" He described the marriage of Rowland's vocals and Guetta's production by stating that \"[Rowland's] got a spiralling, sky-scraping melody to sing too.\"Erin Martin of PopMatters said that \"When Love Takes Over\" had euphoric properties. Martin said the song was \"a classic, triumphant dance number, and Rowland's powerhouse vocals ensure that this song has anthemic potential for years to come.

She also noted that the song was central to the concept and \"love-spreading message [that] Guetta delivers on the album as a whole.\" David Balls of Digital Spy agreed with the song's anthem credentials. \"[It] is further evidence that Rowland may no longer be resigned to living in Beyonc\u00e9 [Knowles'] shadow. Fusing classic dance beats with a heady, emotionally charged vocal, it's a world away from the mid-tempo R&B numbers with which she started her solo career. In fact, this packs a punch from the very first listen, meaning it could well become one of the summer anthems of 2009.\" However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was less impressed than the other critics, simply noting the song as \"a cheesy synthpop makeover of Coldplay's 'Clocks'.\" Wood did however state that it was among Guetta's best work and was an example of when the DJ is \"most commercial\".The song was nominated for the Best Dance Recording award at the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony. It lost out to \"Poker Face\" by Lady Gaga. The song's Electro Extended Remix was successful at the ceremony, winning Guetta his first Grammy Award for the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical.

{"id": "264_755", "question": "What music label is Where Do Broken Hearts Go represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_55013", "text": "\"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\" is a song recorded by American singer Whitney Houston for her second studio album, Whitney (1987). It was released as the fourth single from the album on February 25, 1988. The song was written by Frank Wildhorn and Chuck Jackson and produced by Narada Michael Walden. A pop ballad set in the key of D major, the record is about someone seeking for a former lover to return after a breakup. Upon its release, the song received mixed reviews from critics. \nThe song helped Houston to set an all-time chart record on the Billboard Hot 100, in which it became Houston's seventh consecutive number one single on the chart, beating the record of six, previously held by The Beatles and The Bee Gees. As of 2024, the record still holds. It also made Houston just the second artist to land four number one singles off one album after Michael Jackson had set the record with his Bad album and made her the first female artist to do so.\nBoth the song and the song's music video, directed by Peter Israelson, received some negative reaction from some members of Houston's core black audience who accused the singer of \"selling out\". Houston would later perform the song in full on her Moment of Truth World Tour, while in later tours such as the I'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour and The Bodyguard World Tour, portions of the song was included in a \"Love Medley\" segment, usually near the end of the medley.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_55014", "text": "By September 1986, Whitney Houston had quickly risen to superstardom following the release of her self-titled debut album, Whitney Houston, which had spawned four consecutive top ten singles, the latter three having gone to number one in a row on the Billboard Hot 100, having sold more copies than any album released by an African-American female artist at the time. That month, while Houston was on her first headlining world tour, The Greatest Love World Tour, Arista head Clive Davis began preparing songs for Houston's sophomore release. Following the global crossover success of \"How Will I Know\" produced by Narada Michael Walden, Davis handpicked him to be the primary producer of the second album. During the summer, Houston began recording with Walden with material Davis had previewed for the singer in demo recordings, including \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\". Though Davis wanted Houston to have a younger, accessible sound, Davis agreed to continue the previous album's use of ballads.\nComposer and lyricist Frank Wildhorn, who later conceived the Broadway musical, Jekyll & Hyde, had wanted to write a song for Houston after hearing her duet with Teddy Pendergrass, \"Hold Me\", a couple of years earlier. He and songwriter Chuck Jackson were eventually hired by Davis to compose a ballad for the singer. According to Wildhorn, Jackson, known for writing hit songs such as \"This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)\" and \"I've Got Love on My Mind\" for Natalie Cole, called him on the phone and gave him the title. From there, he said, he \"sat there at the piano... and in about 40 minutes, 90% of the sketch of the song was done\". Afterwards, he called Jackson back and told him to come over his house because \"I think we've got something\" and the duo finished the song later that night.\nAfter presenting the song to Davis, Wildhorn recalled the song's selection for the album:\"From what I understand, it was one of the first songs chosen for the album. Knowing [it was for] Whitney's project, there must have been 50,000 songs submitted after (ours). So every week it was, 'Do we still have it?' We were going through hell.\"\nAlong with \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" and \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\", it was one of the earliest songs presented for Houston's sophomore effort. Prior to her recording the song, other singers, such as Smokey Robinson, offered to record it but Wildhorn and Jackson refused, holding out hope for Houston to record it.When Houston eventually listened to a demo record of the ballad, the singer flatly turned it down, thinking the song \"had no depth to it\". Years later, in a 2000 interview, Houston admitted, \"I didn't even wanna do '[Where Do] Broken Hearts [Go]', I hated the song, I didn't wanna sing it\". However, Davis insisted the song would be perfect for Houston to sing because, he told her, \"this is your number one song\". Houston said she eventually found \"some meaning in [the song] that I could relate to\" when she entered the studio with Walden producing the session.Once Houston started recording, Wildhorn recalls being struck by her performance:\n\n\u201cI cried the first time I heard Whitney sing \u2018Where Do Broken Hearts Go.\u2019 I've had Julie Andrews, Liza Minnelli, Johnny Mathis, Trisha Yearwood and Patti LaBelle (sing songs I've written), but if someone put a gun to my head, the answer is Whitney's version of \u2018Where do Broken Hearts go,\u2019 going No. 1, that's as good as it gets.\u201d", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_55015", "text": "AllMusic's Ron Wynn highlighted the track in his review of the Whitney album.

Houston's record was also significant in that it broke the record first set by The Beatles and later shared with The Bee Gees, each of which scored six consecutive number one hits in a row. Following the song's release, Houston wrote a congratulatory letter to Wildhorn that simply said, \"Where do broken hearts go? I have no idea\".In addition, the song made her just the second artist in history to achieve four number one singles from one album after Michael Jackson had accomplished this feat with his Bad album and made her the first female artist to accomplish this goal. Houston is only one of five female artists to date to have four or more number one singles off a single album, with succeeding releases by Paula Abdul (Forever Your Girl, 1989-90), Janet Jackson (Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, 1989-91), Mariah Carey (Mariah Carey, 1990-91) and Katy Perry (Teenage Dream, 2010-11). Also, with seven number one singles, she had the most number one hits by a female artist in the 1980s, sharing the feat later with Madonna, who tied it with \"Like a Prayer\". Prior to Madonna tying it, Houston's song had also made her the solo female artist with the most number ones ever at the time, besting a record previously set by American recording artist Diana Ross, who had six.The song topped the chart for two weeks, eventually replaced by Terence Trent D'Arby's \"Wishing Well\" afterwards, and spent a total of 18 weeks on the chart, with six of those weeks inside the top ten altogether. It entered the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart (formerly \"Hot Black Singles\") at number 60 on the week of March 5, 1988, peaking at number two nine weeks later, bested by Al B.

The single debuted at number 30 on the UK Singles Chart, the week ending date of March 12, 1988, and three weeks later reached a peak of number 14 on the chart.

Although neither band released any albums, Wolfgang, who are still active, recorded an undisclosed number of songs that, according to Joensen, are \"pretty much ready to release\".T\u00fdr formed in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1998. Heri Joensen met his old bandmate, K\u00e1ri Streymoy, at a party in January in Copenhagen. Joensen suggested to Streymoy that they should meet up and jam. Streymoy initially declined, but later took him up on his offer. They were soon joined by another former bandmate, bassist Gunnar H. Thomsen, expanding the duo into a trio. In 2001, guitarist Terji Skiben\u00e6s joined the band.\nThey signed a worldwide deal with Austria's Napalm Records in early 2006, while signed to the Faroese record label Tutl. In September 2012, they signed a three-album deal with Metal Blade Records.They began making music which was heavily inspired by Norse mythology, kv\u00e6\u00f0i (Faroese traditional music), and heavy metal music in general. According to the band's frontman Heri Joensen:\n\"T\u00fdr's musical mission is to break down the walls that are erected between all the kinds of metal that have arisen over the years. Power, doom, black, progressive, gothic, viking, folk, ethnic and epic metal. Walls and labels do nothing but fill people with prejudice.\"\nAccordingly, scholarship has found that the band's lyrics and imagery promote pan-Nordic ideologies, and draw on well established, transnational genre conventions from metal music; but has also suggested that the band's insistence on their Faroese identity, which has been fetishised by international audiences, could be \"regarded as a form of self-exoticisation\". The band's handling of traditional songs is characterised by fidelity to traditional melodies, but more complex and innovative handling of associated chord progressions and harmonies.The band has been accused of promoting Nazi ideologies through their use of runes and other imagery appropriated by Nazis. The band responded to these accusations with the song \"Shadow of the Swastika\" on the album Lay of Thrym (2011), which in the assessment of Karl Spracklen, \"attacks the far-right for appropriating...heathen symbols and images associated with pre-Christian northern Europe\". Even so, scholars have, in the words of Catherine Hoad and Samuel Whiting, suggested that \"through imagining the Viking as an ancestral, genetic category, the 'common past' of the Nordic people is constructed as a self-identity apart from other people\" in the work of T\u00fdr. Likewise, Spracklen finds that \"the themes in T\u00fdr's songs celebrate pagan identity, Viking identity and the hegemonic masculinity of the Viking warrior combined with the modern-day heavy metal anthem of being an individual\".The band released the song \"Rainbow Warrior\", a song about the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in response to their campaign against whaling in the Faroe Islands.

I (Matthew Ellis) stopped playing music and went off to college, but the guy who I was always playing guitar with (Kyle Cooke) called me up and said he had terminal cancer. He said I should move home so we could start a new band. I suddenly felt like I would much rather be playing music, and that's what I was supposed to do.  So, I moved back home and we started A Hope for Home.\nAfter a long struggle with cancer, founding member Kyle Cooke died on August 5, 2006. After his death, friends and family members of Cooke created the \"Kyle Cooke Foundation\", a \"non-profit fundraising corporation that raises money for The Friends of Doernbecher Foundation and the people of the Camas and Washougal community on a need by need basis\".\nOn their website is a post stating the following:\n\nOur message is simple, Believe in Hope. No matter what you are going through in your life, there is always hope. Kyle battled cancer for 6 years of his life, and lived far longer than he was ever expected. He never stopped fighting, and didn't give into hopelessness. He lived a full life through it all, and used the pain and hardships that he was going through for a much higher purpose. Hopelessness can easily take over when we are in overwhelming circumstances and it takes real strength to overcome it. Kyle found hope through his faith in God and through the love from the people in his life. When it comes down to it, those are the things that can keep you going, no matter what life throws your way. So the best way you can support our message, is be somebody's hope, help them through whatever they are going through, just like Kyle did. Thank you. Much love & God bless, The Kyle Cooke Foundation.\n\nA Hope for Home has since continued with new members, while still bearing the name created by Kyle Cooke as a remembrance of their formation. In 2007, A Hope for Home entered the home studio of bassist Dan McCall (Robots Ate My Studio) and recorded their first album Here, the End. The track \"Kyle\" off of the album was written for Kyle Cooke by Matthew Ellis, and in the liner notes of the album there are words stating that the entire album is dedicated to the memory of Kyle Cooke. After releasing Here, the End in 2007, A Hope for Home gained local praise and began building their fan base by playing routinely at local venues such as The Noisebox in Camas, Wa and the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, OR.After several months of touring for Here, the End, A Hope for Home re-entered the studio to begin recording their next album.On December 4, 2008 the band announced via their Purevolume page that they had signed to Strike First Records (the imprint label for Facedown Records). \"After 2 years of being a 100% DIY group we have finally been given an awesome chance to take the next step in the industry, and we can't be more excited\".\n\nThe Everlasting Man was released on January 20, 2009 on Strike First Records. The title of the album is taken from the G. K. Chesterton nonfiction work of the same name. The Everlasting Man added more atmospheric textures to their sound, using many different guitar effects and tones woven together with electronic backgrounds while still holding a strong drum and bass foundation. In an interview with Indie Vision Music, Keyboardist Eric Gerrard explained that \"We wanted to sing about and affirm value in things that aren't often talked about in the current scene today\" and that \"a lot of our ideas lined up with what Chesterton talks about in the book (The Everlasting Man)\".\n\nIn September 2009 after several months of touring A Hope for Home announced that drummer Ian Vidovic would be leaving the band to pursue his other musical projects \"Roads\" and international touring with \"The New Divide\".After the departure of Vidovic, A Hope for Home entered a practice space in Beaverton, Oregon (recruiting the help of fellow drummer Lance Taylor) and began writing Realis, their third album to date. Throughout January 2010 A Hope for Home recorded at the \"Red Room Studios\" in Seattle, Washington and \"Robots Ate My Studio\" in Camas, WA. The album was produced by bassist Dan McCall, mastered by Troy Glessner at \"Spectre Mastering\", and featured art direction and design by guitarist Tanner Morita. Realis, a concept album about the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, was a drastic change in the band's musical style. Far from the \"breakdowns\", \"dance parts\", and \"double bass\" of their previous records, Realis brought song structures and instrumentation that clearly indicated their Post and Sludge metal influences (Envy, Cult Of Luna, Isis). The album was well received by many music review sites (Absolute Punk, The New Review, Indie Vision Music).On September 10, 2011 the band announced via their Facebook page that they had finished their fourth official album titled \"In Abstraction\", and that it is set to be released on December 6, 2011 on Facedown Records. On November 25, 2011 the band played a cd release show for In Abstraction at the local Portland, OR Rotture-Branx venue complex along with local artists Tribes, Tiny Dads, Amos Val, My Mantle, and Kye Kye.In January of 2022, the band announced via their Twitter account that they had entered the studio to record their first album in over 10 years, set to be released in 2022.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_55129", "text": "Often described as Post-hardcore, A Hope for Home covers many other genres including Sludge metal, Post-rock, Post-metal, Alternative, and Experimental rock.

Among the notable singles from the album included her cover of the boogie-woogie hit, \"Rocking Pneumonia and the Boogie-Woogie Flu\", the club hit title track, \"Family\", \"Shoot Him on Sight\" (her first collaboration with songwriters Cynthia Biggs and Dexter Wansel) and \"Over the Rainbow\", the latter track becoming her solo cover of a tune she had previously recorded as member of Patti LaBelle and the Blue Belles in the sixties. LaBelle had been performing the song in concert after embarking on her solo career. The new recording was listed as the b-side of the single \"Family\" and became a standout in LaBelle's career, quickly becoming a signature song for LaBelle.

They had several hits, including a cover version of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes' \"Don't Leave Me This Way\", which spent four weeks at No. 1 in the UK charts and became the biggest-selling single of 1986 in the UK. He also sang backing vocals on Fine Young Cannibals' version of \"Suspicious Minds\", which was a UK Top 10 hit.\nThe Communards split in 1988; Somerville began a solo career the following year.

He also sang on the second Band Aid project at the end of 1989.\nIn November 1990, Somerville's greatest-hits album The Singles Collection 1984/1990 (which featured his hits with Bronski Beat and The Communards in addition to his own material) was released; it reached number 4 on the UK Album Chart. It included a reggae cover of the Bee Gees' hit song \"To Love Somebody\", which also reached the UK Top 10. Also in 1990, Somerville contributed the song \"From This Moment On\" to the Cole Porter tribute album Red Hot + Blue produced by the Red Hot Organization, the proceeds from which benefited AIDS research.\nIn 1991, Somerville provided backing vocals to a track called \"Why Aren't You in Love With Me?\" from the album Ripe by Communards offshoot band Banderas.

He began formal piano studies at the age of nine and was soon playing for his church choir. His father had brought an alto saxophone home from the service and when Hank entered Manassas High School, he took it up in order to join the band. He credits Charlie Parker, Louis Jordan, Earl Bostic and Johnny Hodges as early influences.\nCrawford appears on an early 1952 Memphis recording for B.B. King, with a band including Ben Branch and Ike Turner.In 1958, Crawford went to college at Tennessee State University in Nashville, Tennessee. While at TSU, he majored in music studying theory and composition, as well as playing alto and baritone saxophone in the Tennessee State Jazz Collegians. He also led his own rock 'n' roll quartet, \"Little Hank and the Rhythm Kings\". His bandmates all thought he looked and sounded just like Hank O'Day, a local saxophonist, which earned him the nickname \"Hank\". This is when Crawford met Ray Charles, who hired Crawford originally as a baritone saxophonist. Crawford switched to alto in 1959, and remained with Charles' band \u2014 becoming its musical director until 1963.When Crawford left Ray Charles in 1963 to form his own septet, he had already established himself with several albums for Atlantic Records. From 1960 until 1970, he recorded twelve LPs for the label, many while balancing his earlier duties as Ray's director. He released such pre-crossover hits as \"Misty\", \"The Peeper\", \"Whispering Grass\", and \"Shake-A-Plenty\".\nHe also has done musical arrangement for Etta James, Lou Rawls, and others. Much of his career has been in R&B, but in the 1970s he had several successful jazz albums, with I Hear a Symphony reaching 11 on Billboard's Jazz albums list and 159 for Pop albums.\nDavid Sanborn cites Crawford as being one of his primary influences. Crawford is recognized by saxophonists as having a particularly unique and pleasing sound. In 1981, he featured, with fellow horn players Ronnie Cuber and David Newman, on B.B. King's There Must Be a Better World Somewhere.\nIn 1983 he moved to Milestone Records as a premier arranger, soloist, and composer, writing for small bands including guitarist Melvin Sparks, organist Jimmy McGriff, and Dr. John. In 1986, Crawford began working with blues-jazz organ master Jimmy McGriff. They recorded five co-leader dates for Milestone Records: Soul Survivors, Steppin' Up, On the Blue Side, Road Tested, and Crunch Time, as well as two dates for Telarc Records: Right Turn on Blue and Blues Groove. The two toured together extensively.\nThe new century found Crawford shifting gears and going for a more mainstream jazz set in his 2000 release The World of Hank Crawford. Though the songs are compositions from jazz masters such as Duke Ellington and Tadd Dameron, he delivers in that sanctified church sound that is his trademark. Followed by The Best of Hank Crawford and Jimmy McGriff (2001).\nCrawford died on January 29, 2009, at his home in Memphis, aged 74, due to complications arising from an earlier stroke.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When Arbuckle was urged to write, she turned to Matt Bronleewe\u2014an original member of Jars of Clay who happened to be her next-door neighbor\u2014and the two hit it off. The debut album, Plumb, was released in 1997. Plumb has said subsequently that the addition of the letter \"B\" to the end was the idea of her producer Matt Bronleewe and, in her mind, also represents Bronleewe's important contribution to her sound.In 1999, Plumb released a second studio album, Candycoatedwaterdrops, which won the 2000 Gospel Music Association Dove Award for \"Modern Rock Album of the Year\". Three tracks from it were later covered by other artists; \"Stranded\" and \"Here with Me\" by Jennifer Paige and, in 2001, \"Damaged\" by Plummet. Though the album won the DOVE Award for Best Modern Rock Album in 2000, and saw strong radio success with the single \"God-Shaped Hole\", the subject matter and approach of much of Plumb's music was often considered too dark and taboo for the mainstream Christian marketplace. Plumb's tendency to write songs about deeply personal issues, such as international hit \"Cut\" which addressed cutting, and \"Damaged\" which addressed a girl coping with being molested as a child, led to more enthusiastic reception by fans of alternative and dance music. Fueling the break from contemporary Christian music, \"Cut\" was also used prominently during a pivotal scene in the storyline of The Vampire Diaries in the 10th episode of season 1, \"The Turning Point\". Later in 1999, all band members left the band, and since that time Plumb became a solo project of Tiffany Arbuckle.\nPlumb considered leaving the music industry after the 2000 album, but changed her mind after receiving a note from a fan a few hours before what she thought to be her final concert. The letter was about her song \"Damaged\" about a girl coping with being molested as a child. The note said \"Whatever you do, I just want you to never forget that you have changed someone's life,\" which inspired Plumb to remain in the music industry. She signed to Curb Records in 2003, releasing the album Beautiful Lumps of Coal on March 25, 2003. The lead single, \"Real\", peaked at No. 41 on the UK Singles Chart. Her next album, Chaotic Resolve, entered the Billboard 200 album chart at No. 177 on March 9, 2006. \"Better\" reached No. 1 on the U.S. Christian airplay chart. The Bronleewe & Bose remix of her follow-up \"Cut\", hit No. 1 on SiriusXM's dance hits channel BPM, and No. 5 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart.Shortly after the birth of her second child, Plumb recorded her fifth album, Blink, as a collection of lullaby inspired songs. It was released on October 9, 2007, immediately becoming one of her best selling and most enduring albums to date. Lead single \"In My Arms\" was used in conjunction with key plot narratives for both Vampire Diaries and One Tree Hill, and became Plumb's biggest international hit to date, selling close to half a million singles in both the United States and Russia. \"In My Arms\" received remixes by Kaskade, Scotty K, Bronleewe & Bose, Gomi, and Bimbo Jones, with the latter reaching the No. 3 spot on the Billboard Dance chart.On May 19, 2009, Curb Records announced that it would release a career-spanning greatest hits album, Beautiful History, which was released later in the year and included several new songs. The first single from Beautiful History, \"Hang On\", reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2009 and reached the top spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in 2010.\nPlumb returned to the studio in 2010 with longtime producer and co-writer Matt Bronleewe to begin work on what would become her 6th studio album, while also changing management and signing with alternative boutique firm Street Talk Media. The debut single from the project, \"Drifting\", a co-penned duet with longtime friend Dan Haseltine (of Jars of Clay), spread quickly across Christian rock radio. The second single, \"Need You Now (How Many Times)\", went to contemporary Christian music radio in early 2012 and has become Plumb's most successful single to date in that market, rising to number to No. 1 on multiple radio and iTunes charts in both the United States and Canada by year's end. The single has remained in regular rotation nationwide for well over a year, selling close to 300,000 singles on iTunes to date, and is BDS certified at over 100,000 radio spins. The album Need You Now was released worldwide in February 2013, charting at a career-best No. 56 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 2 on Christian album charts. The album received five Dove Award nominations including Song of the Year and Contemporary/Pop Album of the Year. With her children now all at least grade school age, and with the massive success of Need You Now, 2012 and 2013 saw the most aggressive touring of her entire career, playing major festivals throughout 2012 and 2013, embarking on her first and largely sold-out headlining tour in the fall of 2013, and joining the massive Winterjam arena tour for November 2013-14.Plumb released her seventh studio album, Exhale, on May 4, 2015.Plumb left Curb Records in early 2017 to form her own label, Plumb Music, and released her first single \"God Help Me\" in July 2017. The song was one of six tracks included on the EP God Help Me in late 2017. She followed it up with the album Beautifully Broken in June 2018 on Centricity Music.Following the No. 1 chart successes of \"In My Arms\", \"Hang On\", and \"Cut\", Plumb has been increasingly sought-after in the dance and electronic world. In 2011, she collaborated with trance DJ Paul Van Dyk on \"I Don't Deserve You\", playing several shows with Van Dyk, and filming a music video together in middle Tennessee.

They recorded the 1966 hit \"Dirty Water\", written by their producer, Ed Cobb. (Ed Cobb is also wrote \"Tainted Love\", a Gloria Jones song which became world famous when Soft Cell did a version of it.) \"Dirty Water\" is the anthem of several Boston sports teams and is played following every Boston Red Sox and Boston Bruins home win.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_55331", "text": "The Standells band was formed in 1962 by lead vocalist and keyboard player Larry Tamblyn (born Lawrence Arnold Tamblyn, February 5, 1943), guitarist Tony Valentino (born Emilio Bellissimo, May 24, 1941), bass guitarist Jody Rich, and drummer Benny King (aka Hernandez). Tamblyn had previously been a solo performer, recording several 45 singles in the late 1950s and early 1960s including \"Dearest\", \"Patty Ann\", \"This Is The Night\", \"My Bride To Be\" and \"Destiny\" for Faro and Linda Records. He is the brother of actor Russ Tamblyn and the uncle of actor Amber Tamblyn.\nThe Standells band name was created by Larry Tamblyn, derived from standing around booking agents' offices trying to get work. In early 1962, drummer Benny King joined the group, and as \"the Standels\", their first major performance was in Honolulu at the Oasis Club. After several months, Rich and King departed. Tamblyn then assumed leadership of the group. He and Valentino re-formed the Standels, adding bass guitarist Gary Lane (September 18, 1938 \u2013 November 5, 2014) and drummer Gary Leeds, later known as Gary Walker of The Walker Brothers. Later that year, the band lengthened its name to \"Larry Tamblyn & the Standels\". In 1963 an extra \"L\" was added, and as \"Larry Tamblyn and the Standells\" the group made its first recording \"You'll Be Mine Someday/Girl In My Heart\" for Linda Records (released in 1964). In the latter part of the year, the band permanently shortened its name to \"The Standells\". After the Standells signed with Liberty in 1964, Leeds left the group, and was replaced by lead vocalist and drummer Dick Dodd. Dodd was a former Mouseketeer who had been the original drummer for The Bel-Airs, known for the surf rock song \"Mr. Moto\", and eventually became the singer who sang lead on all of the Standells hit songs.\nIn 1964, Liberty Records released three Standells singles and an album, The Standells in Person at P.J.s. The album was later re-issued as The Standells Live and Out of Sight. The band also appeared on The Munsters TV show, as themselves in the episode \"Far Out Munsters,\" performing \"Come On and Ringo\" and a version of The Beatles' \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\". In late 1964, they signed with Vee Jay and released two singles in 1965. Later in the year they signed with MGM for one single.\nThe group appeared in several low-budget films of the 1960s, including Get Yourself a College Girl (1964) and cult classic Riot on Sunset Strip (1967). The Standells performed incidental music in the 1963 Connie Francis movie Follow the Boys, which coincidentally co-starred Larry Tamblyn's brother, Russ Tamblyn. The Standells played the part of the fictional rock group the \"Love Bugs\" on the television sitcom Bing Crosby Show in the January 18, 1965, episode \"Bugged by the Love Bugs\". In addition to appearing in the aforementioned The Munsters episode as themselves, they also appeared performing an instrumental in the background in the March 29, 1965 Ben Casey series episode, \"Three 'Lil Lambs.\" The band also performed the title song for the 1965 children's movie, Zebra in the Kitchen.\nSome reports state that early versions of the band had a relatively clean image and performed only cover songs. However, early 1964 photos counter that notion, showing the Standells with long hair, making them one of the first American rock groups to adopt that style. In order to work in conservative nightclubs like P.J.'s, the group members were forced to cut their shaggy locks. Like the Beatles, early rock groups did mostly cover songs in nightclubs.\nIn 1965 the group \u2013 Dodd, Tamblyn, Valentino and Lane \u2013 signed with Capitol Records' label Tower, teaming up with producer Ed Cobb. Cobb wrote the group's most popular song, \"Dirty Water\", which the band recorded in late 1965. The song's references to the city of Boston are owed to Cobb's experiences with a mugger in Boston. The song also makes reference to the Boston Strangler and the dorm curfews for college women in those days.\"Dirty Water\" reached No. 11 on the Billboard charts on June 11, 1966, No. 8 on the Cashbox charts on July 9, 1966, and No. 1 on the Record World charts. \"Dirty Water\" was on the WLS playlist for 17 total weeks, tied only by \"California Dreamin'\" for most weeks on that playlist during the 1960s. Though the song is credited solely to Cobb, band members Dodd, Valentino and Tamblyn have claimed substantial material-of-fact song composition copyright contributions to it as well as contributing to its arrangement. Tamblyn has stated that Cobb's version was a \"standard blues song\", adding: \"We took the song with the condition that we could arrange in any way we want; we added the guitar riff into it and all of the wonderful vocal asides like, 'I'm gonna tell you a story, It's all about my town, I'm going to tell you a big fat story'...that was all written by us.\"\nAccording to critic Richie Unterberger,\"Dirty Water\" [was] an archetypal garage rock hit with its Stones-ish riff, lecherous vocal, and combination of raunchy guitar and organ. While they never again reached the Top 40, they cut a number of strong, similar tunes in the 1966\u20131967 era that have belatedly been recognized as 1960s punk classics. \"Garage rock\" may not have been a really accurate term for them in the first place, as the production on their best material was full and polished, with some imaginative touches of period psychedelia and pop. \"Dirty Water\" is listed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\"Dodd briefly left the Standells in early 1966, and was replaced by Dewey Martin, who became a member of Buffalo Springfield. Dodd returned to the group a few months later, as the \"Dirty Water\" song began to climb the charts. The band recorded additional songs for their first full studio album Dirty Water in April 1966. Another popular track on the album was \"Sometimes Good Guys Don't Wear White\", which would later be recorded by Washington, D.C. hardcore band Minor Threat, New York City punk band The Cramps, and Swedish garage band The Nomads.\nThe follow-up studio album, Why Pick on Me \u2014 Sometimes Good Guys Don't Wear White, was released in November 1966 and included the single \"Why Pick on Me\", which peaked at No. 54 on the Billboard chart. Gary Lane left the Standells in 1966, and was replaced by bass guitarist Dave Burke. John Fleck (born John William Fleckenstein in Los Angeles, August 2, 1946 \u2013 October 18, 2017), formerly of Love, soon replaced Burke in early 1967. The band then released their third album, The Hot Ones! In early 1967. It was simply a selection of popular songs that they covered. The band's fourth studio album, Try It, released in October 1967, contained the song \"Riot on Sunset Strip\", which had been released earlier in 1967 to support the soundtrack for the movie of the same name. The title track \"Try It\" was later recorded by Ohio Express and Cobra Killer. Picked by Billboard magazine to be the Standells' next hit, \"Try It\" was banned by Texas radio mogul Gordon McLendon, who deemed the record to have sexually suggestive lyrics. The Standells were asked by Art Linkletter to debate with McLendon on his House Party TV show in 1967. By most accounts, McLendon was handily defeated, but, by then, most radio stations had followed McLendon's lead and would not play the record. A third single released from this album, \"Can't Help But Love You\", would be the Standells last entry into the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 78, while also peaking at No. 9 in the Cashbox charts.\nIn 1968, Dick Dodd left the band to pursue a solo career. The Standells continued to perform with a varying line-up thereafter, briefly including guitarist Lowell George who went on to play with Little Feat.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_55332", "text": "In the 1980s, Dodd, Tamblyn and Valentino performed at a few shows with The Fleshtones.

As the title suggests, the Standells were thumbing their noses at McLendon. In 2000, bassist Gary Lane re-joined the Standells to perform at Las Vegas Grind. Between 2004 and 2007 the band was called upon to reform to make several appearances at major Boston sporting events. In 2006 the band sued Anheuser Busch for over $1 million after the company used \"Dirty Water\" in sports-related beer commercials without permission.After a show at the Cannery Casino and Hotel in Las Vegas in May 2009, The Standells reformed with Tamblyn and former bassist John Fleck, along with guitarist Paul Downing and veteran drummer Greg Burnham. The group went on to make appearances at Los Angeles venues Amoeba Records, Echoplex and the Whisky a Go Go. In 2010 they toured in Europe, performing in several countries,including their first ever UK show at 229 The Venue in London on June 19, 2010. In late 2010, Downing was replaced by guitarist Adam Marsland. In 2011, the band decided to record their first new album in over 40 years. Through Kickstarter, the Standells raised money towards the cost of the album. Marsland left the group shortly thereafter. He was replaced by singer/guitarist Mark Adrian, a former member of the rock group Artica. In March 2012, the Standells performed at the SXSW Festival.In September 2012, Dick Dodd briefly rejoined the group, and they appeared at the Monterey Summer of Love \"45 Years On\" Festival that month. On August 9, 2013, they released a new album, Bump, on GRA Records. Dodd did not participate in the album. In June, Dodd again departed from the Standells for personal reasons.

The following month, the band revealed they were in the process of recording with Brian Eno, doing pre-production. In October and November, the band embarked on a UK club tour. They used the stint to test how the new songs would sound live before they planned to record them. They had written over 30 tracks for inclusion on their next record; on the opening night, the band played seven of these new songs.\nThough the band had planned to use a different producer for the main sessions, Eno and guitarist/violinist Saul Davies were enlisted to produce most of the recordings.Inspired by playing the new songs live, the band decided to gather in a circle and record live-in-the-studio at Ridge Farm Studios in Capel, Surrey with engineer Gary Langan. Eno likened the process to when artists make their debut record: \"they're full of enthusiasm and excitement and they know what they're doing and it's a pleasure.\" Additional production was done by KK, at the suggestion of Eno, and drummer David Baynton-Power.

He added that the album had an underlying theme of distaste for \"habits, addictions, [and] impulses that we can't control. Different characters expressing their particular loops.\" Booth said the album was the first since their fifth studio album Laid (1993) that they had strayed from the Verse-chorus-verse structure.\"Space\" begins as a Radiohead-esque track with an electro intro before shifting into chorus sections in the vein of Simple Minds. In the context of the song's pre-chorus, Booth said that \"[s]cientifically we are made up of about 96% space,\" which he found interesting. Discussing \"Falling Down\", Booth said after recording a jam with Eno, it was given to KK. He edited the track; after giving Booth a copy, he re-did the vocal take, resulting in the final version.

All three EPs have differing musical styles. Mike Powell of online music magazine Pitchfork noted it was \"amazing\" that so much material could be released in such a short period of time. However, despite the amount of music released by Blake in 2010, most of the material on his debut album is completely new.In interviews about the album, Blake cited fellow Londoners the xx as an influence, telling Clash's Robin Murray their success with debut xx \"made it a lot easier for me\". He added that the band's acclaim meant listeners \"are gonna be a lot less shocked by [this album]\".Blake, speaking to Jo Youle and Mark Savage of the BBC, said that a lot of the vocals on the album were by him, despite relying more heavily on samples in previous work. \"There are times when it might seem there's a sample being used, but I've just sampled myself. That's what makes this record special compared to everything [else] I've done.\"Before the album's release, Blake was named in both BBC's \"Sound of 2011\" shortlist, and came second to Jessie J in the running for the BRIT Awards' Critics' Choice Award.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_55443", "text": "Grayson Currin of Pitchfork noted that the album is \"composed of tender torch songs, elegiac drifters, and soulful melodies, Blake's first puts him in the rare company of fellow singers-- Thom Yorke, Karin Dreijer, Antony Hegarty, Justin Vernon, Dan Bejar-- who've recently bent their own lavish voices, not samples, to make interesting pop music shaped with electronics\". Blake has evidently done this with many tracks on the album.\nThe album begins with \"Unluck\", a post-dubstep song with multi-layered vocals (processed through the use of Auto-Tune and vocoders) and distorted synths. The second track, \"The Wilhelm Scream\" is a cover version of \"Where to Turn\" by his father, James Litherland. \"The Wilhelm Scream\" is built around soft synth tones and booming percussion which gradually increases in volume to create a slightly claustrophobic sound.\nThe third track, \"I Never Learnt to Share\" is a post-dubstep song with elements of electronic rock and soul music, beginning with repetitive a cappella vocals, then adding in electric guitars and lush keyboards. The song has a unique bass drop three minutes and forty seconds into the song. This is then followed by the two-part \"Lindisfarne\". \"Lindisfarne I\" is entirely a cappella, while \"Lindisfarne II\" takes these vocals (with some new lines added) and pairs them with acoustic guitar and light percussion. Both parts of the song extensively use vocoders and Auto-Tune.\nThe album's sixth track, \"Limit to Your Love\", is a minimalist dubstep cover of the song of the same name by Feist. The song uses only Blake's singing, piano, percussion, and a wobble bassline. This is followed by \"Give Me My Month\", a short piano ballad, also a minimalist piece.\nIn the album's eighth track, \"To Care (Like You)\", Blake pitch shifts, cuts-up, and layers his own vocals and combines them with quiet keyboards and a bass-heavy and very percussive beat. \"Why Don't You Call Me\" opens with only voice and piano, \"played with the studied delicacy of a classical student\". Blake then splices up the piano chords and vocals to create unique breaks.\nIn \"I Mind\", Blake creates a wobble bass out of \"incomprehensible vocal loops\", Latin-American rhythms and distorted bass noises. As with the last track, \"Why Don't You Call Me\", it begins solely with piano and vocals. The album concludes with \"Measurements\", in which critics noted that Blake's layered vocals sound like a black gospel choir. Popmatters also noted that the song contains elements of synth-pop.\nThe deluxe edition of the album, in addition to being packaged with the Enough Thunder EP, adds two new tracks originally exclusive to the vinyl version (and added in the same places as they were on the vinyl album). \"Tep and the Logic\" is added as track 1 and \"You Know Your Youth\" is added as track 13. The two are IDM songs with chopped up vocals and light keyboards and piano.\nThe songs \"Why Don't You Call Me\" and \"You Know Your Youth\" include samples of a cover of Joni Mitchell's \"A Case of You\" performed and recorded by Blake himself.

During a tour of the west coast of the US in support of Plastic Letters, Blondie encountered Australian producer Mike Chapman in California. Peter Leeds, Blondie's manager, conspired with Chrysalis Records to encourage Chapman to work with Blondie on new music. Drummer Clem Burke recalls feeling enthusiastic about the proposition, believing Chapman could create innovative and eclectic records. However, lead vocalist Debbie Harry was far less enthusiastic about Chapman's involvement as she knew him only by reputation; according to Chapman, her animosity towards him was because \"they were New York. [He] was L.A.\". Harry's cautiousness abated after she played Chapman early cuts of \"Heart of Glass\" and \"Sunday Girl\" and he was impressed.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_55465", "text": "In June 1978 the band entered the Record Plant in New York to record their third album, and first with Chapman. However, Chapman found the band difficult to work with, remembering them as the worst band he ever worked with in terms of musical ability, although praising Frank Infante as \"an amazing guitarist\". Sessions with Chris Stein were hampered by his being stoned during recording, and Chapman encouraged him to write songs rather than play guitar. Similarly, according to Chapman, Jimmy Destri would prove himself to be far better at songwriting than as a keyboardist, and Clem Burke had poor timing playing drums. As a result, Chapman spent time improving the band, especially Stein with whom Chapman spent hours rerecording his parts to ensure they were right. Bassist Nigel Harrison became so frustrated with Chapman's drive for perfection that he threw a synthesizer at him during recording. Chapman recalls the atmosphere at the Record Plant in an interview for Sound on Sound:\n\nThe Blondies were tough in the studio, real tough. None of them liked each other, except Chris and Debbie, and there was so much animosity. They were really, really juvenile in their approach to life\u2014a classic New York underground rock band\u2014and they didn't give a fuck about anything. They just wanted to have fun and didn't want to work too hard getting it.\nChapman took an unorthodox approach when recording with Harry whom he describes as \"a great singer and a great vocal stylist, with a beautifully identifiable voice. However ... also very moody\". Chapman was far more cautious of demanding much from Harry as he saw her as a highly emotional person who would vest these emotions in the songs they made. He remembers Harry disappearing into the bathroom in tears for several hours at a time during recording. During a day of recording, Harry sang two lead parts and some harmonies, less work than she did previously with Gottehrer. This was due to Chapman encouraging her to be cautious about the way she sang, particularly to recognise phrasing, timing and attitude.Blondie recorded Parallel Lines in six weeks, despite being given six months by Terry Ellis, co-founder of Chrysalis Records, to do so. For the drums, a traditional set-up was used and Chapman fitted Neumann microphones to the toms, snare and hi-hat, as well as several above the site. When recording, Chapman would start with the bass track, which was difficult to record at the time, by way of \"pencil erasing\". Chapman explained in an interview for Sound on Sound, \"that meant using a pencil to hold the tape away from the head and erasing up to the kick drum. If a bass part was ahead of the kick, you could erase it so that it sounded like it was on top of the kick. That's very easy to do these days, but back then it was quite a procedure just to get the bottom end sounding nice and tight.\" A combination DI/amp method was used to record Harrison's bass and Destri's synthesizer. Shure SM57 and AKG 414 microphones were used to capture Infante's Les Paul guitar. King Crimson leader Robert Fripp makes a guest appearance on guitar on \"Fade Away and Radiate\".\nAfter the basic track was complete, Chapman would record lead and backing vocals with Harry. However, this process was hampered by many songs not being written in time for the vocals to be recorded. \"Sunday Girl\", \"Picture This\" and \"One Way Or Another\" were all unfinished during the rehearsal sessions. When recording vocal parts, Chapman remembers asking Harry if she was ready to sing, only for her to reply \"Yeah, just a minute\" as she was still writing lyrics down.

Its style of \"state-of-the-art pop/rock circa 1978\", as AllMusic's William Ruhlmann described it, showed Blondie deviating from new wave and emerging as \"a pure pop band\". Ken Tucker believed the band had eschewed the \"brooding artiness\" of their previous albums for more hooks and pop-oriented songs. Chapman later said, \"I didn't make a punk album or a New Wave album with Blondie. I made a pop album.\" The album's eleven pop songs have refined melodics, and its sole disco song, \"Heart of Glass\", features jittery keyboards, rustling cymbals by drummer Clem Burke, and a circular rhythm. Burke credited Kraftwerk and the soundtrack to the film Saturday Night Fever as influences for the song and said that he was \"trying to get that groove that the drummer for the Bee Gees had\".Lyrically, Parallel Lines abandoned what Rolling Stone magazine's Arion Berger called the \"cartoonish postmodernist referencing\" of Blondie's previous new wave songs in favor of a \"romantic fatalism\" that was new for the band. \"Sunday Girl\" deals with the theme of teen loneliness. Music critic Rob Sheffield said that the lyric \"dusty frames that still arrive / die in 1955\", in \"Fade Away and Radiate\", is the \"best lyric in any rock'n'roll song, ever, and it's still the ultimate statement of a band that always found some pleasure worth exploiting in the flashy and the temporary.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_55467", "text": "Parallel Lines took its name from an unused track written by Harry, the lyrics of which were included in the first vinyl edition of the album.

Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released in February 1979 in the United States by Capricorn Records and PolyGram Records elsewhere. The Allman Brothers Band had broken up in 1976 following internal turmoil, amplified by escalating drug use. The band members splintered into different acts \u2014 among those Great Southern, Sea Level, and the Gregg Allman Band. Guitarist Dickey Betts approached his bandmates in 1978 with the prospects of a reunion. It is the first to feature guitarist Dan Toler and bassist David Goldflies. Living together in Sarasota, Florida, they rehearsed and wrote the material for their next album in fall 1978.\nThey began recording Enlightened Rogues that December, and recording stretched into the new year. Sessions took place in Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, with producer Tom Dowd, who worked on a trio of early Allman Brothers albums. The group stayed at a home overlooking Biscayne Bay, which promoted unity within the members. The recording process was smooth and pleasant, with members showing courtesy to one another in comparison to ill feelings felt earlier. The album's title comes from a quote original guitarist Duane Allman used to describe the band: \"The world is made of two great schools, enlightened rogues and religious fools.\"\nThe album was a commercial success in the United States, peaking at #9 and earning a RIAA gold certification. \"Crazy Love\" was the group's second of three Top 40 hits, reaching #29. Despite this, Capricorn would file for bankruptcy that fall, leading the Allman Brothers to sign to Arista Records.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_55485", "text": "Following the critical and commercial failure of their fifth studio album, Win, Lose or Draw (1975), the Allman Brothers Band continued to tour nationwide, playing 41 shows to some of the biggest crowds of their career. The shows were considered lackluster and the members were excessive in their drug use.  The \"breaking point\" came when Gregg Allman testified in the trial of erstwhile road manager Scooter Herring. Bandmates considered him a \"snitch,\" and he received death threats, leading to law-enforcement protection. Herring was convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and received a 75-year prison sentence, which were later overturned as he received a lesser sentence. For his part, Allman always maintained that Herring had told him to take the deal and he would take the fall for it, but nevertheless, the band refused to communicate with him. As a result, the band finally broke up; Leavell, Williams, and Jaimoe continued playing together in Sea Level, Betts formed Great Southern, and Allman founded the Gregg Allman Band.Betts approached Allman with the prospect of a reunion in 1978. Allman, who was addicted to Dilaudid and vodka, met with his former bandmates after completing a detox program. He, Betts, Trucks, and Jaimoe all agreed to reform. \"No one was pleased with how things had ended back in \u201976, and the combination of the passing of time, missing each other musically, and money all made it easier for us to put the past behind us,\" Allman later wrote. Together, the rest of the band joined Great Southern for five songs during an August concert in New York's Central Park. Williams and Leavell were invited for the reunion, but were busy with Sea Level (Jaimoe had left the band several months prior). As a result, the Allman Brothers added two new members from Great Southern: guitarist \"Dangerous\" Dan Toler and bassist David \"Rook\" Goldflies. Jaimoe summarized the performance: \"We were a little rusty\u2014maybe a lot rusty\u2014and we were playing with some different guys, but it felt good to be together.\" Following this, the band made an appearance at the annual Capricorn Records picnic.The band were immediately pressured to record a new album, but declined, in order to see how everyone communicated \"musically and spiritually.\" The band went into rehearsals in Sarasota, Florida, staying together at the Pirates Den on Anna Maria Island. The main reason for living together at the Pirates Den was to see if they could simply get along together. Meanwhile, former record label Capricorn Records had been splintering, and the band were not receiving their royalty payments. An audit revealed Capricorn was deep in debt to PolyGram Records; manager Phil Walden had borrowed $4 million he could not return. Steve Massarsky became the band's manager during this time, and helped renegotiate a deal with Capricorn Records.

For the album, the band strived to reach their \"classic\" sound, typified by their earliest releases. Criteria owned a row of houses along Biscayne Bay they allowed artists to stay in while recording; Eric Clapton had named his album 461 Ocean Boulevard after his residence while there. Allman recalled they stayed \"three doors down\" from that location while recording, and held fond memories for the location: \"That place just calmed us all out\u2014really helped us travel back in time. It was just a groove, man, one big family again. The house was huge, so there was plenty of room for all of us.\" A cook prepared breakfast and dinner for the group, and while all were still regularly using drugs, it was more controlled than it had been in the past.Things went smoothly during the recording process. Goldflies remarked that Allman and Betts got along well: \"What I saw many times, especially towards the beginning, was a real effort from both Gregg and Dickey to be really gracious to each other. I sensed there was a real effort to make it work. They tried to make it happen.\" Allman described reuniting with Dowd: \"We had communication, and I mean the utmost communication. Tom was a master at getting everyone's attention focused on one little item, and I picked up so many little ways to go about things from him, and to keep from wasting time.\" The band lacked a slide guitarist, leading Betts to take over the role, which he disliked. He later noted that it altered the band's sound, which in its earlier days relied on Betts's guitar and a slide guitar working together with guitarist John Lundahl, a Chicago native. Allman partnered with former confidant Twiggs Lyndon once more as his manager, despite the wishes of Betts. Following a small altercation with Allman, he left the area and ceased being his manager.Allman wrote \"Just Ain't Easy\" as a description of years living in Hollywood with pop star Cher, whom he was married to from 1975 to 1979. \"It's about defeat and resignation, being on the bottom,\" he wrote.

Many long-time fans criticized the album's sound, which bore little relation to the gothic/folk/progressive rock of the band's past.  With the band now consisting solely of leader Warren Defever and vocalist Lovetta Pippen, an experienced soul and gospel singer who had first appeared as a part of a gospel choir on 1996's Stars on ESP, Someday... is basically a straightforward soul and R&B album.  This was the first HNIA album without long-time vocalist Karin Oliver, whose unique vocal range was, for many fans, the band's key element.\nOn the other hand, there are some fans who appreciate the album for what it is, noting Defever's characteristic songwriting, production and musicianship, and Pippen's impressive vocal skills.  Album reviews were also favorable from publications who were unfamiliar with the band's back catalog.\nThe replacement of Oliver with Pippen as primary vocalist lead some to believe that Defever had fired Oliver, which tainted the opinions of fans without even hearing the album.  The truth was that Oliver had always held jobs in marketing and advertising during her time with HNIA, as the band had never been a commercial success.  With the changes at 4AD (outlined in the article on the previous album, Ft. Lake), 4AD had increased commercial expectations for the band.  When Ft. Lake was not a big seller, Oliver chose to accept a full-time job offer in marketing, more out of reasons of feasibility than any hostility between her and Defever. Oliver left the band after the US release party for Ft. Lake; a tape of this concert is available from Time Stereo.  She was replaced on the resulting tour with Erika Hoffman, who had also been contributing since Stars on ESP.\nDefever and Pippen recorded the album from 1998 through 2000.  The release of the album was delayed for a year.  While 4AD's official reason for the delay was that the elaborate V23 artwork was difficult to produce, there was also speculation that the label was unhappy with the album and had no idea how to market it.  The label decided not to renew their option on the band's contract beyond the next album, about six months before Someday... was released.  Defever and Pippen were encouraged to go ahead and record the final album of the contract right away.

They also proved to be influential, both during their initial run and to a new generation of musicians like Yo La Tengo and Espers.As the Holy Modal Rounders, Stampfel and Weber began playing in Greenwich Village, at the heart of the ongoing American folk music revival. Their sense of humor, irreverent attitude, and novel update of old-time music brought support from fellow musicians but also caused controversy amongst folk purists in the scene. In 1964, the Rounders made history with their self-titled debut, which included the first use of \"psychedelic\" in popular music. After their first two studio albums, the duo briefly joined the newly formed underground rock band the Fugs in 1965 and helped record the band's influential debut album. \nFollowing their exit from the Fugs, the duo released two albums that experimented with psychedelic folk before they expanded their lineup to a full rock band by the end of 1968. The Holy Modal Rounders' expanded lineup notably included famed playwright Sam Shepard as a drummer and later guitarist Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter (amongst others) before stabilizing in 1971, with a band that would later back Jeffrey Frederick as the Clamtones. In 1972, Weber relocated the band to Portland, Oregon, while Stampfel stayed behind in New York. Although Stampfel would describe Weber as his \"long lost brother,\" they often had a hostile relationship and the two would only reunite sporadically following the band's Portland move.

While the Rounders famously were the first to use \"psychedelic\" in popular music, music journalist Greil Marcus also used the Holy Modal Rounders as the earliest example of old American music being reinvented with modern aesthetics, commenting that they were \"incapable of taking anything seriously, but nevertheless [got] to the bottom of folk songs other people sang as if they were obvious.\" The band has frequently been lumped into what Marcus coined as \"old weird America,\" which refers to the type of music Bob Dylan recorded for The Basement Tapes. Michael Simmons also noted the band's trail-blazing aesthetics, saying that \"the story of the Rounders is one of the grand secret histories of 20th-century American music. If music history is often a game of Who Came First?, then the Rounders can be said to be the first psychedelic hippie freak band and the first aggressively anti-purist folkies, making them a crucial missing link between early- and late-20th-century pop.\" The band's first two albums have been called early forerunners of the genre freak folk, with music critic Robert Christgau commenting \"freak folk started here.\" The band's two psychedelic albums are also of historical significance, with The New York Times saying that they \"still stand as extreme examples of acid-tinged folk music.\"Writing for New Haven Independent, Eleanor Polak discussed how the band had not just had significant influence, but that they had also inspired \"countless other musicians to take deep dives into American folk music to find the dark and weird within.\" Music critic Eric Weisbard, writing for  Spin in 1999, commented that after the band helped the folk scene rediscover many great \"blues and Appalachian singers\" in the 1960s, \"it's time the tables were turned--it's time for the rediscovery of the Holy Modal Rounders.\" Stampfel in particular was singled out for praise, with Weisbard declaring \"Stampfel has become to roots music what Jon Langford is to  punk: the patron saint of lost causes and good times in spite of them.\" Robert Christgau had similar high praise, believing that the Holy Modal Rounders, like Bob Dylan, \"greatly transcend\" the New York folk scene they began in and that \"next to Bob Dylan, Stampfel is the closest thing to a genius\" to come out of the 1960s folk revival. Christgau also praised Weber, calling him an \"ace guitarist\" who \"can just not give a fuck while remaining both charming and musical.\" Jason Weiss observed that \"from the start, [Weber] was recognized for his technique and divine spontaneity he brought to old-time music.\" The New York Times also noted Weber's \"mastery of traditional guitar styles.\"Rounder Records was named partially as a tribute to the Holy Modal Rounders. The label would release several of the band's studio albums after its formation in 1970.

Prato considered the album Cooper's best solo work, despite the absence of the original band: \"While the music lost most of the gritty edge of the original AC lineup, Welcome to My Nightmare remains Alice's best solo effort \u2013 while some tracks stray from his expected hard rock direction, there's plenty of fist-pumping rock to go around.\" However, he maintained that \"the rockers serve as the album's foundation \u2013 'Devil's Food', 'The Black Widow', 'Department of Youth', and 'Cold Ethyl' are all standouts, as is the more tranquil yet eerie epic 'Steven'.\" He concluded by comparing the album to Cooper's subsequent solo efforts by stating: \"Despite this promising start to Cooper's solo career, the majority of his subsequent releases were often not as focused and were of varying quality.\" The New York Times, describing the subsequent tour, said that Cooper was much tougher than he looked in concert.Since its release, Welcome to My Nightmare has become the most-represented album in Alice Cooper's concert setlists, accounting for, even including concerts from before its release, 15.7 percent of all the songs he has played live \u2013 a proportion which of course will be much larger counting only shows since the album's composition and release.

After moving to New York City, Clarke did one-man performance art shows. Although believing rock bands to be less artistic, he was persuaded to reform a band, which he named Warrior Soul after a line in a George S. Patton docudrama.The band began to play in New York City in 1987, and soon came to the attention of Geffen, who signed the band. Geffen directed Clarke to shed his hired band and get new players. Clarke insisted on keeping Pete McClanahan as his bass player, and recruited guitarist John Ricco and former Killing Joke drummer Paul Ferguson.In 1990, Warrior Soul released their first album, Last Decade Dead Century. AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia compared it to Nirvana's Nevermind, saying that although comparable success eluded Warrior Soul, it explored similar themes.  Rivadavia speculated that the nihilism of Nevermind may have resonated more with Generation X.1991 saw Ferguson replaced on drums by Mark Evans, and the band's second album Drugs, God and the New Republic released, which took their anarchist leanings even further. A nationwide support tour with Queensr\u00ffche (with whom they shared management from the Q Prime agency) followed.The following year saw the release of the band's third album, 1992's Salutations from the Ghetto Nation, and Clarke's relationship with Geffen sour. Clarke's interviews became increasingly bitter, often focusing on the band's record label, whom he accused of ignoring the group's potential. Eventually, Clarke resorted to an all-out war, telling all that the band's fourth release, 1993's Chill Pill had been botched on purpose in order to fulfill the band's contract. The ploy seemed to work, and by early 1994 Warrior Soul were dropped by Geffen.A number of lineup changes ensued. Longtime guitarist John Ricco was ousted, replaced by two guitarists:  Alexander Arundel (aka X-Factor aka Gene Poole ) and Chris Moffet (former Cycle Sluts from Hell lead guitarist). Not long after, Mark Evans and Chris Moffet departed. At that time former Nuclear Assault/Cities/Cycle Sluts from Hell drummer Scott Duboys joined the band. The line-up now consisted of Clarke, Arundel, McClanahan and Duboys. Clarke sought to reinvent Warrior Soul as self-appointed cyberpunks for their fifth album, 1994's The Space Age Playboys, released on the independent Futurist label. At this time adding old friend and collaborator, Peter Jay on rhythm guitar. While touring in support of the album, Warrior Soul headlined the 1995 Kerrang! UK tour, as well as performing at the 1995 Dynamo Open Air Festival, and also at the 1995 Donnington Monsters of Rock concert.\nAfter the performance of their last live show in September 1995, Arundel, Duboys, and longtime bassist McClanahan quit the band, leading in short order to Clarke's decision to retire the band later that year.\nIn 1996, Odds & Ends was released as a collection of demos recorded on an eight-track with Arundel, and leftover material that was originally intended for release on Elektra Records.\nThe \"classic\" lineup of Clarke, Ricco, McClanahan, and Evans later reunited for a short tour and to go in the studio to re-record twelve of the bands' songs, released on Dream Catcher Records as Classics in 2000.  All Warrior Soul albums were remastered and re-released on CD and MP3 in 2006 and 2009, including with bonus material (mostly live songs originally released as b-sides).  The first three albums were also re-released on vinyl in 2009.\nClarke says many of their songs are politically based, such as \"Blown Away\", \"Superpower Dreamland\", \"In Conclusion\", and \"Children of the Winter\".

His mother died when he was eight years old, and Kantner remembered that he was not allowed to attend her funeral; his father sent him to the circus instead.After his mother's death, his father, who was a traveling salesman, sent young Kantner to Catholic military boarding school. At the age of eight or nine, in the school's library, he read his first science fiction book, finding an escape by immersing himself in science fiction and music from then on. As a teenager he went into total revolt against all forms of authority, and he decided to become a protest folk singer in the manner of his musical hero, Pete Seeger.After graduating from Saint Mary's College High School, he attended the University of Santa Clara (where he first befriended classmate Jorma Kaukonen) and San Jose State College (now San Jos\u00e9 State University), completing three years of coursework before dropping out to enter the music scene.

Might as well die of something I like.\" Identifying as a political anarchist, Kantner advocated the use of entheogens such as LSD for mind expansion and spiritual growth, and was a prominent advocate of the legalization of marijuana, which he regularly consumed for most of his adult life. In a 1986 interview, Kantner shared his thoughts about cocaine and alcohol, saying, \"Cocaine, particularly, is a bummer. It's a noxious drug that turns people into jerks. And alcohol is probably the worst drug of all. As you get older and accomplish more things in life in general, you realize that drugs don't help, particularly if you abuse them.\" When Kantner suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in 1980, his attending physician at Cedars-Sinai, Stephen Levy, was quick to point out it was not a drug-related issue, saying: \"There is zero relationship between Paul's illness and drugs. He doesn't use drugs.\"Belying his reputation as a near-teetotaler during the commercial heyday of Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship, Kantner began to use alcohol more frequently in his later years, with bandmate Jude Gold ultimately characterizing Kantner's vodka intake as an \"on-again/off-again love affair.\" In a 2016 reminiscence, Marty Balin reflected on this period: \"It was sad to see. He didn't do anything to take care of his health with all his drinking and everything, smoking cigarettes all the time, pushing himself too much. He asked me to join him for this last go-round. He'd been touring around the world and I talked to him and said, 'You better be careful. Take care of yourself. You've got a grueling schedule.' He just said, 'Don't worry about me.

Their live shows would often only last around fifteen minutes, occasionally cut short due to injury caused by spectators.

And then after that it's the problem of finding someone that can stand you!\"In the late 1980s, after living in Los Angeles for 30 years, Ronstadt moved to San Francisco because she said she never felt at home in Southern California. \"Los Angeles became too enclosing an environment\", she says. \"I couldn't breathe the air and I didn't want to drive on the freeways to get to the studio. I also didn't want to embrace the values that have been so completely embraced by that city. Are you glamorous? Are you rich? Are you important? Do you have clout? It's just not me and it never was me.\" In 1997, Ronstadt sold her home in San Francisco and moved back to her hometown of Tucson, Arizona, to raise her two children. In more recent years, Ronstadt moved back to San Francisco while continuing to maintain her home in Tucson.\nIn 2009, in honor of Ronstadt, the Martin Guitar Company made a 00\u201342 model \"Linda Ronstadt Limited Edition\" acoustic guitar. Ronstadt appointed the Land Institute as recipient of all proceeds from her signature guitar.In 2013, Simon & Schuster published her autobiography, Simple Dreams: A Musical Memoir, as well as the Spanish version, Sue\u00f1os Sencillos \u2013 Memorias Musicales.In August 2013, Ronstadt revealed she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, leaving her unable to sing due to loss of muscular control, which is common to Parkinson's patients. She was diagnosed eight months prior to the announcement and had initially attributed the symptoms she had been experiencing to the aftereffects of shoulder surgery and a tick bite. In late 2019, it was reported her doctors had revised their diagnosis to progressive supranuclear palsy, a degenerative disease commonly mistaken for Parkinson's due to the similarity of the symptoms.Ronstadt describes herself as a \"spiritual atheist\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Produced by Paul Simon, Art Garfunkel and Roy Halee, the album was released on April 3, 1968, in the United States by Columbia Records. The duo had risen to fame two years prior with the albums Sounds of Silence and Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme and the soundtrack album for the 1967 film The Graduate.\nBookends is a concept album that explores a life journey from childhood to old age. Side one of the album marks successive stages in life, the theme serving as bookends to the life cycle. Side two largely consists of previously-released singles and of unused material for The Graduate soundtrack. Simon's lyrics concern youth, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality. Much of the material was crafted alongside producer John Simon (no relation), who joined the recording when Paul Simon suffered from writer's block. The album was recorded gradually over the period of a year, with production speeding up around the later months of 1967.\nInitial sales for Bookends were substantial in the US, and the album produced the number-one single \"Mrs. Robinson\". The album sold well in the US and in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number one. Bookends was considered a breakthrough for the duo, placing them on the same level as artists such as Aretha Franklin, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and The Rolling Stones at the forefront of the countercultural movement in the 1960s.

(1964). Following another release, Sounds of Silence (1965), the duo recorded and released Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme (1966), which brought new critical and commercial success to the duo. Simon, then 25, felt he had finally \"made it\" into an upper echelon of rock and roll, while most importantly retaining artistic integrity (\"making him spiritually closer to Bob Dylan than to, say, Bobby Darin\", wrote biographer Marc Eliot). The duo chose William Morris as their booking agency after a recommendation from Wally Amos, a mutual friend through their producer, Tom Wilson.During the sessions for Parsley, the duo cut \"A Hazy Shade of Winter\" and decided to release it as a single then, where it peaked at number 13 on the national charts. Similarly, they recorded \"At the Zoo\" for single release in early 1967 (it charted lower, at number 16). Simon began work for Bookends around this time, noting to a writer at High Fidelity that \"I'm not interested in singles anymore\". He had hit a dry spell in his writing, which led to no Simon & Garfunkel album on the horizon for 1967. Artists at the time were expected to release two, perhaps three albums each year and the lack of productivity from the duo worried executives at Columbia Records. Amid concerns for Simon's idleness, Columbia Records chairman Clive Davis arranged for up-and-coming record producer John Simon to kick-start the recording. Simon was distrustful of \"suits\" at the label; on one occasion, he and Garfunkel brought a tape recorder into a meeting with Davis, who was giving a \"fatherly talk\" on speeding up production, in order to laugh at it later.Meanwhile, director Mike Nichols, then filming The Graduate, had become fascinated with the duo's past two efforts, listening to them nonstop before and after filming. After two weeks of this obsession, he met with Clive Davis to ask for permission to license Simon & Garfunkel music for his film. Davis viewed it as a perfect fit and envisioned a best-selling soundtrack album. Simon was not as immediately receptive, viewing movies akin to \"selling out\", creating a damper on his artistic integrity. However, after meeting Nichols and becoming impressed by his wit and the script, he agreed to write at least one or two new songs for the film. Leonard Hirshan, a powerful agent at William Morris, negotiated a deal that paid Simon $25,000 (US$219,043 in 2023 dollars) to submit three songs to Nichols and producer Lawrence Turman. Several weeks later, Simon re-emerged with two new tracks, \"Punky's Dilemma\" and \"Overs\", neither of which Nichols was particularly taken with.

John Simon's first session with the group was for \"Fakin' It\" in June 1967. The duo were signed under an older contract that specified that the label pay for sessions (\"As a folk duo, how much could recording costs be?\" said John Simon). Simon & Garfunkel took advantage of this indulgence, hiring viola and brass players, as well as percussionists. When the viola players arrived, the duo were so intrigued with the sound of the musicians tuning their instruments before recording that they spent nearly all night (at Columbia's expense) trying to find the random sound.\nThe record's brevity reflects its concise and perfectionistic production. The team spent over 50 studio hours recording \"Punky's Dilemma\", for example, and re-recorded vocal parts, sometimes note by note, until they were satisfied. Simon paid close attention to his vocal takes, and he strived to get each line perfect. He took a bigger role in all aspects of production, and harmonies for which the band was famous gradually disappeared in favor of songs sung solo by each member. Although the album had been planned long in advance, work did not begin in earnest until the late months of 1967.John Simon's work with the duo produced several tracks that ended up on Bookends, such as \"Punky's Dilemma\", \"Save the Life of My Child\", and \"Overs\". In October 1967, Morgan Ames, writer for High Fidelity magazine, attended a recording session with the duo, Simon, Halee and an assistant engineer at Columbia's recording studio on 52nd Street in New York City. Her observations were reported in the November edition of the magazine:\n\nThe team's working relationship is built upon listening to each other, asking advice, taking it, building each other's morale. Though it's obvious they enjoy working with John Simon, the last word seems to come from one partner to the other [...] Ideas are tried, accepted, rejected. Time passes. Too much time. Too little headway [...] \"Punky's Dilemma\" is put aside for the moment and Simon begins work on the title song for the new album, Bookends.\nWork on Bookends slowed by the beginning of the new year, with John Simon's departure from Columbia. The duo and Halee completed production themselves, recording \"America\" on February 1, the final version of \"Mrs. Robinson\" on February 2, and \"Old Friends\" and the closing \"Bookends Theme\" on March 8.

In January 1968, the duo appeared on a Kraft Music Hall special, Three for Tonight, performing ten songs largely culled from their third album. Richard Avedon, regarded then as one of the best photographers, was commissioned to shoot the album cover. When viewed closely, one can see Avedon's reflection in Simon's irises.Bookends was released by Columbia Records on April 3, 1968.

Bookends received such heavy orders weeks in advance of its release that Columbia was able to apply for award certification before copies had left the warehouse, a fact that was touted in magazine ads.  The record became the duo's best-selling album to date. It fed off the buzz created by the release of The Graduate soundtrack album ten weeks earlier, creating an initial combined sales figure of over five million units. In the United Kingdom, Bookends was a number one hit. The album charted highly in both Australia and France, peaking in both countries at number three.The duo had a complicated relationship with Davis; Simon was particularly outraged when Davis suggested raising the list price of Bookends to $5.79 (US$51 in 2023 dollars), one dollar above the standard retail price. Davis explained that including a large poster with each copy made it necessary to charge an extra dollar to cover the cost. Simon scoffed and viewed it as charging a premium on \"what was sure to be that year's best-selling Columbia album\". According to biographer Marc Eliot, Davis was \"offended by what he perceived as their lack of gratitude for what he believed was his role in turning them into superstars\".

Although obscured by its famous predecessor, the album has gained more recognition with time and is largely considered a key record to Phair's legacy as an artist, along with her other two Matador Records releases and the Girly Sound tapes. In 2003, the German version of Rolling Stone magazine placed the record at 95 on its list of greatest records since Autumn of 1994.

The album was recorded in two distinct sessions: the first in August 1993 in Chicago, and the second in February 1994 in the Bahamas.\nGuitarist Casey Rice described the initial sessions at Idful Studios in Chicago as subject to many distractions, such as \"the phone ringing, people dropping by the studio, and so on\". Phair wanted to move recording to New York City, but due to financial constraints, the band ended up continuing with Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas instead.\nThe same team that worked on Guyville worked again on what would become Whip-Smart.

Wood characterized the recording process as very much spontaneous, saying that \"[Liz would] bring in a song and we'd record the whole thing that day. I'd have to write a drum and bass part right on the spot.\" There was, however, pressure to improve on the sound of the previous record, to meet the expectations of Phair's newly formed fanbase.\nLiz Phair has described Whip-Smart as a chronicle of the beginning, middle and end of a relationship: \"a rock fairy tale, from meeting the guy, falling for him, getting him and not getting him, going through the disillusionment period, saying 'Fuck it,' and leaving, coming back to it.\" Phair also described the sound of the album as more confident and playful \u2013 and less frustrated, tense, and sexual \u2013 than Exile in Guyville.Phair is credited, along with Matador Records' in-house art designer Mark Ohe, with the album's art and layout.

Between 1990 and 1999, he had his greatest chart success recording for Universal Music Group Nashville's MCA and Decca branches, with a total of eight albums between those two labels. During this timespan, Chesnutt also charted twenty top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, of which eight reached number one: \"Brother Jukebox\", \"I'll Think of Something\", \"It Sure Is Monday\", \"Almost Goodbye\", \"I Just Wanted You to Know\", \"Gonna Get a Life\", \"It's a Little Too Late\", and a cover of Aerosmith's \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\". His first three albums for MCA (Too Cold at Home, Longnecks & Short Stories, and Almost Goodbye) along with a 1996 Greatest Hits package issued on Decca are all certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); 1994's What a Way to Live, also issued on Decca, is certified gold. After a self-titled album in 2002 on Columbia Records, Chesnutt has continued to record predominantly on independent labels.\nChesnutt is known for his neotraditionalist country and honky-tonk influences, with frequent stylistic comparisons to George Jones. He has recorded several cover songs as both singles and album cuts, including covers of Hank Williams Jr., John Anderson, Don Gibson, Conway Twitty, and Charlie Rich. Artists with whom he has collaborated include Jones, Tracy Byrd, Vince Gill, and Alison Krauss. Mark Wright produced all but one of his albums released in the 1990s, while his work since 2005 has been produced by Jimmy Ritchey. Chesnutt has also won two awards from the Country Music Association: the Horizon Award (now known as Best New Artist) and Vocal Event of the Year, both in 1993.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "264_55859", "text": "Mark Nelson Chesnutt was born on September 6, 1963, in Beaumont, Texas. He drew musical influence from his father,  Bob Chesnutt, who was a singer and record collector. Chesnutt first played drums as a child after receiving a drum kit as a Christmas gift, but at his father's persuasion, he stopped playing drums and chose to focus on singing instead. He dropped out of school in the eleventh grade to begin playing in clubs around southeast Texas. When he turned 17, his father began to take him to Nashville, Tennessee, to begin recording. For the next ten years, he began to record on small regional labels while he was the house band for local Beaumont nightclub Cutters. By the late 1980s, he had released eight singles, which would later be released together as an album titled Doing My Country Thing. Record producer Tony Brown heard one of Chesnutt's independent releases, and recommended him to Mark Wright, a songwriter, session musician, and record producer who helped Chesnutt sign with the Nashville branch of MCA Records in 1990. The same year, Bob Chesnutt died of a heart attack.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_55860", "text": "In 1993, Chesnutt was featured in an ad campaign for Frito-Lay where he sang their tagline \"I know what I like and I like Fritos.\" In 1994, he contributed three cover songs to multi-artist compilation albums. These were Merle Haggard's \"Goodbye Comes Hard for Me\", recorded for the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country; Keith Whitley's \"I Never Go Around Mirrors (I've Got a Heartache to Hide)\" to Keith Whitley: A Tribute Album; and \"Good Ones and Bad Ones\", a duet with George Jones on the latter's 1994 duets album The Bradley Barn Sessions. In 1996, the radio station WKIS in Boca Raton, Florida, compiled a Christmas album titled A Country Christmas from WKIS 99.9, to which Chesnutt contributed a recording of the Christmas carol \"What Child Is This?\" His version made the Hot Country Songs charts that same year due to seasonal airplay.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_55861", "text": "Chesnutt's musical style draws mainly from honky-tonk and neotraditional country. Due to both singers hailing from Beaumont, Chesnutt was frequently compared stylistically to George Jones. Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune wrote that he was \"a throwback to the inwardly-tough, just-do-it kind of country star they were making back when they minted George Jones, who preceded Chesnutt out of the rough-and-tumble East Texas honky-tonks 40 years ago.\" Nash described Chesnutt's vocal style by saying that he \"has a comely, smooth baritone and a supple way of moving through his vocal range\", and a \"friendly foghorn\" with \"earnestness\". Rick Mitchell, writing in The Encyclopedia of Country Music, described Chesnutt as \"arguably the strongest pure-country voice to come out of Southeastern Texas since George Jones\", and an uncredited review in People said that Chesnutt \"has a natural, George Jonesian sob and enough machismo to get away with going falsetto when he wants.\" Chesnutt has cited Merle Haggard, Hank Williams, and Elvis Presley as major influences of his. Mitchell also noted that Chesnutt was able to have success with both ballads and uptempo material such as \"Bubba Shot the Jukebox\" and \"Old Flames Have New Names\", as well as the strong presence of cover songs from the 1950s and 1960s. Some of his songs, such as \"It Sure Is Monday\" and \"Gonna Get a Life\", have featured influences of Cajun music through prominent use of fiddle and accordion.Chesnutt's musical persona placed a greater emphasis on song quality over physical attractiveness, compared to the move toward young and attractive males that prevailed in country music in the 1990s. Nash stated that he \"distanced himself from the pack with an identifiable baritone and a focus on music over image\", and Barry Gilbert of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch similarly stated that he \"put the music and his warm, classic-country voice before the image.\" Chesnutt stated in a 1996 interview that \"I would rather play honky-tonks the rest of my life for $500 a week than be something I'm not.\" He noted that during his latter years at Decca and MCA, he was constantly pressured by label heads to record more mainstream-friendly country pop instead of the traditional sounds of his earlier albums, due to the genre's shift away from neotraditional country having a negative impact on his album sales. He also said that some of the tracks on Savin' the Honky Tonk were songs that the major labels had rejected, and that he would \"rather sell 100,000 albums [of traditional country] than 6 million of some crap that I wasn't happy with.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "264_55862", "text": "Chesnutt has been married to the former Tracie Motley since 1992. The two met in a bar, and according to Chesnutt, \"She came out there with a guy she was with at the time, and I took her away from him\". The couple have three sons: Waylon, Casey, and Cameron. Waylon was named after Waylon Jennings, who jokingly suggested during the recording sessions for their cover of \"Rainy Day Woman\" that the then-pregnant Tracie name their child after him. Although Jennings later stated that the suggestion was a joke, Chesnutt decided to choose the name anyway. In late 1995, following Waylon Chesnutt's birth, Tracie typically stayed home at the couple's house in Jasper, Texas, while also working as an artist. The birth of his sons also caused Chesnutt to tour less frequently by the end of the 1990s, as he wanted to be able to spend more time with his family. On Nov 1, 2023 the singer was hospitalized for an issue that required critical care, and is in the process of undergoing multiple tests to determine the exact problem.
