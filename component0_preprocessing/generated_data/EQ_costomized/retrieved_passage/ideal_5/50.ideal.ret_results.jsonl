{"id": "50_22", "question": "Who is the author of The Homosexual Matrix?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_25681", "text": "The Homosexual Matrix is a book by American psychologist Clarence Arthur Tripp, in which the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book was first published in 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company; it was republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, and that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality. He criticizes Sigmund Freud and argues that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions. He maintains that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning, that early puberty and early masturbation are important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and that a majority of adults are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He criticizes psychotherapeutic attempts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality and argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.\nThe book was controversial and received many negative reviews. It was criticized for Tripp's rambling style, sexism, views about the biological basis of male and female sexual behavior, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, who criticized Tripp's dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, accused him of being biased in favor of homosexuality, charged that he mistakenly claimed that gay men tend to have a larger than average penis size, and objected to his discussion of attempts to change homosexuality through psychotherapy. Tripp himself believed that The Homosexual Matrix had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, the book was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Some commentators complimented Tripp's criticism of psychotherapy and supported his view that erotic feeling depends on resistances to its satisfaction.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_25682", "text": "The Homosexual Matrix was first published by McGraw-Hill Book Company in 1975. A revised edition with a new preface was published by New American Library in 1987.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_25683", "text": "The Homosexual Matrix was influential and widely read, reportedly selling nearly half a million copies. The book has received praise from gay authors such as the historian Martin Duberman, the scholar John Lauritsen, the playwright Larry Kramer, the historian Jonathan Ned Katz, the novelist Lewis Gannett, the novelist Gore Vidal, and the journalist Paul Varnell. Kramer called the work the first book from a \"reputable source\" that \"dared to openly speak of homosexuality as a healthy occurrence\", Katz commented that prior to its publication \"you could count on one hand the books on the subject that had any intellectual substance\", Gannett called it \"the first work to explain in cogent psychological terms why homosexuality is not a developmental failure to achieve heterosexuality\" and wrote that Pomeroy considered it the best book on homosexuality he had ever read, Vidal described it as \"ground-breaking\", and Varnell described it as one of the ten best non-fiction books relating to homosexuality. However, the book was controversial. According to Gannett, Tripp's view that \"gay people and straight people develop their orientations in exactly the same ways\" appalled \"many clinicians and much of the general public\". In 1987, Tripp wrote that no sentence in the book stirred such a \"hateful reaction\" as Tripp's comment that, \"When two men are excited and unrestrained in their sexual interaction, the fire that is fed from both sides often does whip up levels of eroticism that are very rarely reached elsewhere.\" Tripp wrote that it had been used to wrongly portray him as maintaining that homosexuality is an inherently superior form of sexual expression. In 1996, Duberman criticized the book's \"misogynistic passages\".According to the writer Paul Moor, the psychoanalyst Irving Bieber filed an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Bieber accused Tripp, in a passage of The Homosexual Matrix in which Tripp alluded to Bieber and his work Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals (1962), of impugning his scientific honesty and credibility by claiming that he knew of only one patient whom he had helped to become heterosexual and was on such poor terms with him that he could not contact him so that he could validate Bieber's claim to have changed his sexual orientation. However, the APA concluded that there was no evidence of unethical behavior on Tripp's part.Authors who have complimented aspects of The Homosexual Matrix include the anthropologist Donald Symons, the philosopher Timothy F. Murphy, the queer theorist David M. Halperin, and the journalist Philip Nobile. Symons considered Tripp's hypothesis that erotic feeling depends on \"resistance\" plausible. He endorsed his view that sexual encounters between men often involve intense levels of eroticism seldom reached elsewhere. Murphy endorsed Tripp's criticism of conversion therapy. Halperin credited Tripp with significantly expanding on Kinsey's discussion of inversion, while Nobile believed that The Homosexual Matrix \"completed Kinsey's work\" on homosexuality. However, the historian of science Brian Easlea considered it regrettable that Tripp did not further explore the way in which male sexual attraction depends on motifs of dominance.Some of Tripp's claims have been criticized as inaccurate or misleading. The psychiatrist Ruth Tiffany Barnhouse maintained that while The Homosexual Matrix had been praised for its avoidance of bias, it contains multiple misrepresentations. She noted that while Tripp cited an article by Beach as evidence that homosexual behavior is common throughout the animal kingdom, his bibliography included a subsequent article by Beach rejecting his earlier claim on the basis of further research. She criticized Tripp's understanding of masculinity, relations between the sexes, and sexual attraction, as well as his use of the term \"inversion\", noting that it differs from that originally employed by psychiatrists. She also wrote that Tripp was incorrect to claim that no cures of homosexuality have ever been reported, that his discussion of therapeutic treatment of homosexuality was confused, and that many of her colleagues considered his \"slipshod methods and lack of scholarship beneath intellectual contempt and have refused to even dignify his work with a reply.\" The social theorist Jonathan Dollimore described Tripp's account of psychoanalytic theories of homosexuality as an over-simplification bordering on parody.Tripp's views about the causes of homosexuality have been criticized. The economist Richard Posner wrote that Tripp revives the psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's theory that masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a boy on the male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. He criticized the theory on the grounds that homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer credited Tripp with providing the clearest articulation of the social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, he found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality. The psychologist Alan P. Bell and the sociologists Martin S. Weinberg and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith considered Tripp correct to caution against speculation about the role of maternal relationships in the development of male homosexuality, but noted that some studies suggest that \"prehomosexual\" boys have atypical relationships with their mothers.The Homosexual Matrix received positive reviews from the novelist George Whitmore in The Advocate and Fritz A. Fluckiger in the Journal of Homosexuality, as well as from the Atlantic Monthly. The book received a mixed review from David A. Begelman in the Journal of Homosexuality. The book received negative reviews from Robb McKenzie in Library Journal, the author J. M. Cameron in The New York Review of Books, Michael Lynch in The Body Politic, Phil Derbyshire in Gay Left, and Harriet Whitehead in Signs. Negative reviews from psychoanalysts included those from Herbert Hendin in The New York Times, Arno Karlen in the Journal of Sex Research, and Charles W. Socarides in the American Journal of Psychiatry.Whitmore considered the book \"the second great contemporary landmark in the study of homosexuality\", following the Kinsey Reports. He described it as a \"revolutionary work\" that would elicit outrage from psychiatrists. He credited Tripp with showing the \"diversity and fluidity of sexual identity\" and the way in which \"inversion and effeminacy\" relate to other forms of human behavior, and with making the most \"devastating attack\" on therapeutic attempts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality since George Weinberg's Society and the Healthy Homosexual (1972). He praised Tripp's discussions of \"gay sexual response\" and the politics of homosexuality. However, he observed that Tripp did not discuss the gay movement and that his \"centrist\" political views did not necessarily correspond to those of the gay liberation movement, and suggested that feminists, and some gay people, would dislike the book. He stated that it had been seen by two publishers before it was published by McGraw-Hill, and its publication had at one stage been in doubt because of the contents of its \"chapters on politics and psychiatry\". He attributed the problems involved in publishing the book, along with the negative review by Hendin, to prejudice. Fluckiger called the book \"easily the most provocative work on sexuality to have appeared in a long time\" and credited Tripp with offering a powerful challenge to established views about homosexuality and showing command of a range of data from many fields. He maintained that Tripp offered the most novel account of the way in which behavioral expression communicates internal states since the naturalist Charles Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), but considered his most original contribution to be his explanation of how erotic feeling depends on \"resistance\".  The Atlantic Monthly described the book as \"well-written\", \"authoritative\", and \"indispensable\" for readers with a serious interest in homosexuality. It stated that Tripp contradicted most generally held beliefs about the origins of homosexuality with \"an impressive mass of evidence\".Begelman called Tripp a skillful writer who was learned on the subject of homosexuality, but whose objectivity was nevertheless open to question. McKenzie wrote that Tripp only partially succeeded in his goal of describing homosexuality, that his bibliography omitted basic works and included some dubious sources, and that while some of Tripp's observations were thought-provoking, others were ludicrous. He also described the book as a rambling, awkwardly written, and poorly organized anecdotal survey. Cameron called Tripp \"vulgar\" and prejudiced and characterized Tripp's evidence as \"largely literary.\" He criticized Tripp for treating the Kinsey Reports as authoritative, writing that they were out of date. He also criticized Tripp for being careless in his discussion of history and for focusing mainly on male homosexuality and neglecting lesbianism. He was convinced by Tripp's argument that strains and tensions are necessary in a relationship to keep the partners interested in each other, and found his discussion of psychotherapy insightful.\nLynch wrote that while initially delighted by the work, he later concluded that it was a \"deceptive book inadequate to its task\" that the gay movement should not endorse. In his view, Tripp made many claims without empirical evidence and neglected lesbianism and female sexuality in general. He argued that Tripp's understanding of sexual relations between men and women, and his account of how tension between the sexes creates erotic excitement, were influenced by biological determinism. He found Tripp's discussion of why societies have increased divisions between the sexes interesting, but also poorly worked out. He accepted Tripp's view that sexual orientation depends on learning, but disagreed with the details of Tripp's account. He agreed with Tripp's criticisms of psychotherapy, but argued that Tripp's theories were \"linked to psychoanalytic assumptions.\" He accused Tripp of seeking to legitimize homosexuality \"by making it bland\". He also criticized Whitmore for defending Tripp and expressed partial agreement with Hendin's review of the book. Lynch subsequently wrote that the book had been criticized for Tripp's failure to discuss the gay rights movement and negative view of women. According to Lynch, Tripp stated in an interview that he had not written about the gay liberation movement because he did not know enough about it, that he was amazed at the accusation of sexism made against the book, and that he believed the \"gay press\" had reacted with embarrassment to it, while the interviewer suggested that Tripp was hurt by such negative reactions.Derbyshire dismissed the book, arguing that it was based in \"bourgeois social science\" and that Tripp did not appreciate the role of sexism in supporting taboos against homosexuality, which he viewed through \"the ideological forms of advanced capitalism\" and therefore misunderstood as a \"unitary and trans-historical category\". He also argued that Tripp had a sexist focus on gay men and mostly ignored lesbians, that he viewed male and female sexuality as \"biological givens\", and ignored alternative feminist and Marxist accounts of the oppression of gay men and lesbians. He contrasted Tripp's work unfavorably with that of the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault. Whitehead called the book a \"rambling mixture of personal observation and popularized social science\". She wrote that despite some \"more promising kernels of thought\", Tripp wrongly maintained that \"the various forms of human sexual behavior as well as the various human reactions to these forms are reducible to a simple set of psychological imperatives.\" She described Tripp's model of heterosexual relations as sexist, criticized him for focusing only on male homosexuality, and noted that he barely mentioned the gay liberation movement.Hendin called The Homosexual Matrix pseudoscience and Tripp an \"erudite con man\" who lacked impartiality and had a \"bias toward homosexuality\". He argued that Tripp saw homosexuality as superior to heterosexuality and sexual passion as dependent upon anger, mistakenly drew conclusions about heterosexuality from observations about homosexual behavior, and had a distorted view of sexual history and a negative view of women. He wrote that Tripp's conclusion that homosexuality is not related to fear or anger toward women, family relationships, or a reflection of confusion over sexual identity, was baseless. His review was followed by letters of protest from the historian Martin Duberman, Pomeroy, George Weinberg, and others, to which Hendin replied with a rebuttal. Karlen wrote that Tripp made numerous unjustified claims, such as that homosexual men tend to have a larger than average penis size and that there are no confirmed cases of homosexuals being converted to heterosexuality through therapy. He accused Tripp of trying to normalize or exalt homosexuality and denigrate heterosexuality and women, and those who endorsed his work of politicizing sex research. Socarides criticized Tripp for arguing that homosexuality is not pathological, presenting it as preferable to heterosexuality, incorrectly claiming that homosexual men tend to undergo puberty early and to have a larger than average penis size, making \"slurs\" against therapists who attempted to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality, and encouraging homosexuals not to undergo treatment.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He believes that a secret society has kidnapped his friend Jacopo Belbo and is now after him, and that they will soon convene in the museum. As he waits, Casaubon reflects on his life, but it is implied that he is an unreliable narrator whose mind has been warped by conspiracy theories.\nIn the 1970s in Milan, Casaubon, who as a student had participated in the 1968 Italian uprisings, is studying the Knights Templar when he meets Belbo and his colleague Diotallevi. The former works as an editor in a publishing house and invites Casaubon to review a manuscript about the Templars. The manuscript, by Colonel Ardenti, claims he discovered a secret plan of the Templars to take over the world. Ardenti mysteriously vanishes after meeting with Belbo and Casaubon; Casaubon then moves to Brazil to pursue a relationship with a woman named Amparo and meets Agli\u00e8, an elderly man who implies he is the mystical Comte de Saint-Germain. Casaubon's relationship with Amparo falls apart after attending an Umbanda rite, and he returns to Milan, where he is hired by Belbo's employer, Mr. Garamond, as a researcher. Casaubon learns that in addition to a respected publishing house, Garamond also owns Manutius, a vanity publisher that charges incompetent authors large sums to print their work. Garamond has the idea to begin two lines of occult books, one for serious publishing and the other to be published by Manutius to attract more vanity authors. Agli\u00e8, now also in Milan, becomes a consultant to Garamond. Belbo grows jealous of Agli\u00e8's ability to charm Belbo's former mistress Lorenza.\nBelbo, Diotallevi, and Casaubon become submerged in occult manuscripts that draw flimsy connections between historical events, and soon have the idea to develop their own as a game. Using Belbo's personal computer \"Abulafia\" and Ardenti's manuscript as a foundation, the three create what they call \"The Plan\" using a program that rearranges text at random. The Plan eventually becomes an intricate web of conspiracy theories about the Templars and their goal to reshape the world using \"telluric currents\", which are focused at the Foucault pendulum. In addition to numerous other historical organizations apparently involved in The Plan, the three invent a fictional secret society, the Tres (Templi Resurgentes Equites Synarchici, Latin for \"the Risen again Synarchic Knights of the Temple\").\nAs time passes, the three become increasingly obsessed with The Plan and wonder if it could be true. Diotallevi is diagnosed with cancer and attributes it to divine retribution for his role in The Plan. Belbo, overcome by jealousy over Lorenza, discusses The Plan with Agli\u00e8 and claims to be in possession of a Templar map of the telluric currents; Agli\u00e8 demands to see it and is refused. Agli\u00e8, Garamond, Ardenti, and many of the manuscript authors convince themselves they are the Tres, and that Agli\u00e8 is their leader; the latter then forces Belbo to accompany him to Paris. Casaubon visits Belbo's apartment and reads his personal files, then goes to Paris and Foucault's Pendulum to see Agli\u00e8 and his associates.\nIn the present, a group led by Agli\u00e8 gathers around the pendulum for an arcane ritual. Casaubon sees several ectoplasmic forms appear, one of which claims to be the real Comte de Saint-Germain and denounces Agli\u00e8 in front of his followers. Belbo is questioned but refuses to reveal what he knows, inciting a riot during which he is hanged from Foucault's Pendulum. Casaubon escapes the museum and flees to the countryside villa where Belbo grew up, soon learning that Diotallevi succumbed to his cancer at midnight on St. John's Eve, coincidentally the same time Belbo died.\nCasaubon meditates on events and resigns to being captured by the Tres, where he plans to follow Belbo's lead and tell them nothing. While waiting in the villa, Casaubon finds an old manuscript by Belbo that relates a mystical experience he had when he was twelve, in which he perceived ultimate meaning beyond signs and semiotics. He realizes that much of Belbo's behavior, and possibly his creation of the Plan and even his death, was inspired by Belbo's desire to recapture that lost meaning.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_25692", "text": "Most books written in this fiction genre seem to focus on the mysterious, and aim to provide their own version of the conspiracy theory. Eco avoids this pitfall without holding back on the historical mystery surrounding the Knights Templar. In fact, the novel may be viewed as a critique, spoof, or deconstruction of the grand overarching conspiracies often found in postmodern literature, and indeed its very title may well allude to one of postmodernism's key exponents, Michel Foucault. Although the main plot does detail a conspiratorial \"Plan\", the book focuses on the development of the characters, and their slow transition from skeptical editors, mocking the Manutius manuscripts to credulous Diabolicals themselves. In this way, the conspiracy theory provided is a plot device, rather than an earnest proposition.\nBelbo's writings are a recurrent theme throughout the book. The entire book is narrated in the first person by Casaubon, with brief interludes from the files on Abulafia. These passages are often eccentrically written, and deal in most part with Belbo's childhood, his constant sense of failure, and his obsession with Lorenza. The interludes from his childhood serve as a stark contrast to the mythical world of cults and conspiracies. Belbo is extremely careful to not try to create (literature), because he deems himself unworthy, although it becomes somewhat obvious that writing is his passion. This attitude of constant subconscious self-abasement fits in with the overall irony focused on in the book, considering that Belbo is eventually consumed by (re)creation of the Plan; one excerpt meant for the unattainable Lorenza reads,\n\n\"I could not possess you, but I can blow up history.\"Casaubon is a scholar: While Belbo seeks inner peace, Casaubon's quest is of knowledge. The uncertainty of scientific knowledge and human experience is explored in his character, as he participates in various extra-natural events. His narratives abandon his strict realism and become increasingly inclined towards the supernatural as the novel progresses, despite periodic reality checks from his partner Lia.\nMr. Garamond, whose primary business is selling dreams (through his vanity press outlet), comes to believe the fantasy world his authors weave. It is possible, though, that he had always been a \"Diabolical\", and founded his publishing business to fish for information.\nEco shows that if one stops discriminating between whether propositions are right or wrong, it is possible to link any fact or idea with any other, but that this creates a dangerous tendency towards conspiracy theories. As Diotallevi approaches death, he remarks:\n\n\"I'm dying because I convinced myself that there was no order, that you could do whatever you liked with any text.\"As Belbo approaches death, Casaubon remarks of him that:\n\n\"... he refused to bow to nonmeaning. He somehow knew that fragile as our existence may be, however ineffectual our interrogation of the world, there is nevertheless something that has more meaning than the rest.\"As Casaubon awaits death at the hands of those who incorrectly believe that he is withholding some occult information from them, he reflects that:\n\n\"It makes no difference whether I write or not. They will look for other meanings, even in my silence.\"Eco reinforces this theme by quoting Karl Popper at the heading of chapter 118:\n\n\"The conspiracy theory of society ... comes from abandoning God and then asking: Who is in his place?.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_25693", "text": "Foucault's Pendulum (1988) has been called \"the thinking man's Da Vinci Code\". The parchment that sparks the Plan plays a role which is similar to the parchments in the Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau story in Brown's novel and in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982), from which Brown drew inspiration. Eco's novel predated the Da Vinci phenomenon by more than a decade, but both novels are concerned with the Knights Templar, complex conspiracies, secret codes, and even a chase around the monuments of Paris. Eco does so, however, from a much more critical perspective; Foucault is more a satire on the futility of conspiracy theories and those who believe them, rather than an attempt to proliferate such beliefs.\nEco was asked whether he had read the Brown novel; he replied:\n\n I was obliged to read it because everybody was asking me about it. My answer is that Dan Brown is one of the characters in my novel Foucault's Pendulum, which is about people who start believing in occult stuff. \u2013 But you yourself seem interested in the kabbalah, alchemy, and other occult practices explored in the novel.\n No. In Foucault's Pendulum I wrote the grotesque representation of these kind of people. So Dan Brown is one of my creatures.\nEco was indebted to Danilo Ki\u0161's story \"The Book of Kings and Fools\" in The Encyclopedia of the Dead (1983) for the portrayal of Sergei Nilus. The Boston Globe claimed that \"one can trace a lineage from Robert Anton Wilson's The Illuminatus! Trilogy to Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum\". The Illuminatus! Trilogy was written 13 years before Foucault's Pendulum. George Johnson wrote on the similarity of the two books that \"both works were written tongue in cheek, with a high sense of irony.\" Both books are divided into ten segments represented by the ten Sefiroth.\nFoucault's Pendulum also bears a number of similarities to Eco's own experiences and writing. The character of Belbo was brought up in the region of Piedmont in Northern Italy. Eco refers to his own visit to a Candombl\u00e9 ceremony in Brazil in an article compiled in Faith in Fakes, reminiscent of the episode in the novel. He also describes French ethnologist Roger Bastide who bears a resemblance to the character of Agli\u00e8. Eco's novel was also a direct inspiration on Charles Cecil during the development of Revolution Software's highly successful point and click adventure game Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars, in which an American tourist and a French journalist must thwart a conspiracy by a shadowy cabal who model themselves on the Knights Templar.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is also introduced to a blind scholar named Bardo de' Bardi, and his daughter Romola. As Tito becomes settled in Florence, assisting Bardo with classical studies, he falls in love with Romola. However, Tessa falls in love with Tito, and the two are \"married\" in a mock ceremony.\nTito learns from Fra Luca, a Dominican friar, that his adoptive father has been forced into slavery and is asking for assistance. Tito introspects, comparing filial duty to his new ambitions in Florence, and decides that it would be futile to attempt to rescue his adoptive father. This paves the way for Romola and Tito to marry. Fra Luca shortly thereafter falls ill and before his death he speaks to his estranged sister, Romola. Ignorant of Romola's plans, Fra Luca warns her of a vision foretelling a marriage between her and a mysterious stranger who will bring pain to her and her father. After Fra Luca's death, Tito dismisses the warning and advises Romola to trust him. Tito and Romola become betrothed at the end of Carnival, to be married at Easter after Tito returns from a visit to Rome.\n\nThe novel then skips ahead to November 1494, more than eighteen months after the marriage. In that time, the French-Italian Wars have seen Florence enter uneasy times. Girolamo Savonarola preaches to Florentines about ridding the Church and the city of scourge and corruption, and drums up support for the new republican government. Piero de' Medici, Lorenzo de' Medici's son and successor to the lordship of Florence, has been driven from the city for his ignominious surrender to the invading French king, Charles VIII. The Medici palace is looted and the Medici family formally exiled from the city. In this setting, Tito, now a valued member of Florentine society, participates in the reception for the French invaders. Tito encounters an escaped prisoner, who turns out to be his adopted father, Baldassarre. Panicked and somewhat ashamed of his earlier inaction, Tito denies knowing the escaped prisoner and calls him a madman. Baldassarre escapes into the Duomo, where he swears revenge on his unfilial adoptive son. Growing ever more fearful, Tito plans to leave Florence. To do this, he betrays his late father-in-law, Bardo, who died some months earlier, by selling the late scholar's library. This reveals to Romola the true nature of her husband's character. She secretly leaves Tito and Florence, but is persuaded by Savonarola to return to fulfil her obligations to her marriage and her fellow Florentines. Nevertheless, the love between Romola and Tito has gone.\nAgain the action of the novel moves forward, from Christmas 1494 to October 1496. In that time, Florence has endured political upheaval, warfare and famine. Religious fervour has swept through Florence under the leadership of Savonarola, culminating in the Bonfire of the vanities. The League of Venice has declared war on the French king and his Italian ally, Florence. Starvation and disease run rampant through the city. Romola, now a supporter of Savonarola, helps the poor and sick where she can. Meanwhile, Tito is embroiled in a complex game of political manoeuvring and duplicitous allegiances in the new Florentine government. Mirroring this, he has escaped attempts by Baldassarre to both kill and expose him, and maintains a secret marriage to Tessa, with whom he has fathered two children. Romola becomes defiant of Tito, and the two manoeuvre to thwart each other's plans. Romola meets an enfeebled Baldassarre, who reveals Tito's past and leads her to Tessa.\nPolitical turmoil erupts in Florence. Five supporters of the Medici family are sentenced to death, including Romola's godfather, Bernardo del Nero. She learns that Tito has played a role in their arrest. Romola pleads with Savonarola to intervene, but he refuses. Romola's faith in Savonarola and Florence is shaken, and once again she leaves the city. Meanwhile, Florence is under papal pressure to expel Savonarola. His arrest is effected by rioters, who then turn their attention to several of the city's political elite. Tito becomes a target of the rioters, but he escapes the mob by diving into the Arno River. However, upon leaving the river, Tito is killed by Baldassarre.\nRomola makes her way to the coast. Emulating Gostanza in Boccaccio's Decameron (V, 2), she drifts out to sea in a small boat to die. However, the boat takes her to a small village affected by the Plague, and she helps the survivors. Romola's experience gives her a new purpose in life and she returns to Florence. Savonarola is tried for heresy and burned at the stake, but for Romola his influence remains inspiring. Romola takes care of Tessa and her two children, with the help of her older cousin.

Both Renaissance Florence and Victorian England were times of philosophical, religious and social turbulence. Renaissance Florence was therefore a convenient setting for a historical novel that allowed exotic characters and events to be examined in Victorian fashion.\nRomola is the female protagonist through whom the surrounding world is evaluated. Contemporary and modern critics have questioned the likelihood of the level of scholarship attributed to women such as Romola in Renaissance Italy, and have pointed to the possible role of the title character as a Victorian critique of the constrained lot of women in that period, as well as in Eliot's contemporary period. Felicia Bonaparte speculated about the title character as a \"thoroughly contemporary figure, the Victorian intellectual struggling to resolve the dilemmas of the modern age\". In a similar vein, the story also deals with the dilemma of where the duty of obedience for women ends and the duty of resistance begins.The psychological and religious introspection seen in Eliot's other novels is also seen in Romola. Richard Hutton, writing in The Spectator, in 1863, observed that \"[t]he greatest artistic purpose of the story is to trace out the conflict between liberal culture and the more passionate form of the Christian faith in that strange era, which has so many points of resemblance with the present\". The spiritual journey undertaken by the title character in some ways emulates Eliot's own religious struggle. In Romola, the title character has a non-religious and scholarly, yet insular, upbringing. She is gradually exposed to the wider religious world, which impacts her life at fortuitous moments.

Erdrich was also moved to write The Birchbark House to show aspects of a real native family during that time in history. The popular media that existed at the time of her writing often portrayed Native Americans in a negative light, e.g. the racism against natives in Little House on the Prairie. Erdrich wanted to counter this narrative by sharing her own version of these stories. As a child, Erdrich frequently visited Madeline Island, where her family originated. Because of this familiarity, Erdrich chose to set her novel in this part region, telling the story of her family\u2019s people, the Turtle Mountain Chippewa. She hoped that in telling this story she could deepen the understanding that the public had of Native Americans, saying that \u201dthere's this humanity that's been lost in the public perception about Native American people.\u201d The series reinforces the deeper emotional aspects of the Ojibwe, and reminds the reader of their prevailing lineage.Erdrich's larger vision was to give readers a more in depth look into native families. She wanted to make accessing real native lives easier giving children a more well rounded view. The prevailing portrayal of Native Americans in American literature, especially children's books, primarily view natives as people who just went away, and were always going to. Viewing them through their perspective shows that they are people who have survived. Erdrich also planned to create a series of books depicting the displacement of her people over a century, and how they ended up in Turtle Mountain North Dakota. So far she has completed 5 books: The Birchbark House (1999), The Game of Silence (2005), The Porcupine Year (2008), Chickadee (2012), and Makoons (2016).Erdrich researched for The Birchbark House through past stories from oral history and texts. She also read through trappers' journals which had accounted for the epidemic and the moving of her people. Some parts of the book were inspired from her own life. Many of the illustrations and storylines were first hand experiences, like her own pet crow or a makak (birchbark eating bowl). Some characters, like Old Tallow, are based on actual people.

The four seasons, as follows, are summer, fall, winter, and finally spring. Inside each season Erdrich defines the experiences Omakayas has with fellow community members and the nature around her. \nThe structuring of the seasons helps show the connectedness to nature this novel holds. Instead of thinking of months and years, the seasons and climate are some of the only true measurements of time necessary to the lifestyle of our main characters.

There are many characters in The Birchbark House. The following are the characters most of the novel is centered on.\nOmakayas - Omakayas is the 7-year-old protagonist of the novel. Although she has complicated feelings about her siblings, she loves her family very much. Her healing gift became evident when her tribe fell ill from smallpox. She is brave, caring, selfless, and compassionate. Despite her name not being a direct translation of any Ojibwe word, it can be inferred that it is rooted from makwa, meaning bear, and aya, meaning owning.Nokomis \u2013 The maternal grandmother of Omakayas. She lives with Omakayas and her family. She mentors Omakayas to listen to the land and demonstrates her connection to nature through her offerings of tobacco leaves. After tough times befall her family, Nokomis dreams the location of a deer, which once it was hunted and killed, saved the family from starvation. Nokomis is wise, strict, and reliable. \nYellow Kettle (Mama) \u2013 Omakayas's mother is a strong woman who does not often display her anger, but at times her anger pours out. She is the one who keeps the family structure intact while Deydey is traveling. The direct translation of yellow kettle into Ojibwe is Ozaawi Akik. Akik is the Ojibwa word for kettle; however it also has a second meaning: engine or motor. Also, with ozaawaabikad meaning brass,Deydey (Mikwam) \u2013 Omakayas's father is mixed race, half-white and half-Ojibwa. He is a trader who is gone trading during some of the novel. He has a strong personality tempered by moments of tenderness and care. The meaning of Mikwam in the Ojibwe language is 'ice.'Neewo - Omakayas' baby brother whoM Omakayas loves very much. She often pretends that Neewo is her own baby. Neewo feels a stronger connection to Omakayas than he has to his other siblings. He falls victim to the smallpox epidemic.  Readers learn that Omakayas has some form of immunization from the disease, and Neewo may find a subconscious feeling of safety being around Omakayas. The name Neewo comes from the Ojibwa word niiwogonagizi, meaning fourth (typically of the month). This is a direct naming as he is the fourth child in the family. \nAngeline \u2013 Omakayas's older sister whom Omakayas loves but is very jealous of due to perceived perfection. Angeline is very smart and is known in the community for her beauty and her excellent skills in beading. She is usually kind to Omakayas, but can be cold-hearted. \nPinch \u2013 Omakayas's younger brother whom Omakayas loves. As his sister, Omakayas sees the flaws in his character, such as his laziness. Pinch is also something of a trickster, often using his wits to get out of undesirable tasks. Omakayas does not enjoy Pinch. Pinch saves everyone at the end.\nFishtail - Fishtail was a close friend of Deydey and Ten Snow\u2019s husband. He also is one of the members in the community who is learning to read the tracks of the whites. In other words, he is attempting to learn the English alphabet to better aid communication and treaty negotiations with the whites.\nTen Snow \u2013 Ten snow is a connection to the family. She is a close friend of Angeline and Fishtail\u2019s wife. She, along with many others, was a victim of the smallpox epidemic. \nOld Tallow \u2013 A neighbor in the tribe who acts as an \u201caunt\u201d figure to Omakayas. Omakayas understood that Old Tallow treated her with more respect than she did the other children, whom Old Tallow would yell at and send away from her cabin. When the family and community are suffering through the smallpox epidemic, Old Tallow helps Omakayas care for the sick.

Areopagitica is among history's most influential and impassioned philosophical defences of the principle of a right to freedom of speech and expression. Many of its expressed principles have formed the basis for modern justifications of that right.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_25748", "text": "Areopagitica was published on 23 November 1644 at the height of the English Civil War. It takes its title in part from Areopagitikos (Greek: \u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2), a speech written by Athenian orator Isocrates in the 4th century BC. (The Areopagus is a hill in Athens, the site of real and legendary tribunals, and was the name of a council whose power Isocrates hoped to restore.) Some argue that it is more importantly also a reference to the defence that St Paul made before the Areopagus in Athens against charges of promulgating foreign gods and strange teachings, as recorded in Acts 17:18\u201334.Like Isocrates, Milton (who was not a member of parliament) did not mean his work to be an oral speech to that assembly. Instead, it was distributed via pamphlet, thus defying the same publication censorship which he argued against. As a radical, Milton had supported the Presbyterians in Parliament, and would later work as a civil servant for the new republic, but in this work he argued forcefully against Parliament's 1643 Ordinance for the Regulating of Printing, also known as the Licensing Order of 1643, in which Parliament required authors to have a licence approved by the government before their work could be published.\nAccording to the British Library, \"State control of printing was introduced by Henry VIII and continued into the 17th century. In April 1638, political agitator John Lilburne was arrested for importing subversive books. He was fined \u00a3500 and flogged for the two miles between the Fleet Prison and the pillory. Milton wrote his pamphlet as a protest against Lilburne's treatment.\" This issue was personal for Milton, as he had suffered censorship himself in his efforts to publish several tracts defending divorce (a radical stance which met with no favour from the censors). In particular, The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce (1643), which he published anonymously and unlicensed, was condemned by the Puritan clergy as being heretical and intending to foster sexual libertinism, and it was cited in petitions to parliament as evidence of the need to reinstall a system of prepublication licensing. Areopagitica is full of Biblical and classical references which Milton uses to strengthen his argument. This is particularly fitting because it was being addressed to the Calvinist Presbyterians who composed Parliament at that time.According to George H. Sabine, the Areopagitica presumed and was written for an engaged public:\n\nIts basic principle was the right and also the duty of every intelligent man as a rational being, to know the grounds and take responsibility for his beliefs and actions. Its corollary was a society and a state in which decisions are reached by open discussion, in which the sources of information are not contaminated by authority in the interest of party, and in which political unity is secured not by force but by a consensus that respects variety of opinion.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_25749", "text": "Before presenting his argument, Milton defends the very idea of writing a treatise such as Areopagitica. He compliments England for having overcome the tyranny of Charles I and the prelates, but his purpose is to voice his grievances. Milton defends this purpose, holding that to bring forth complaints before the Parliament is a matter of civil liberty and loyalty, because constructive criticism is better than false flattery. He concludes his introduction by encouraging Parliament to obey \"the voice of reason\" and to be \"willing to repeal any Act\" for the sake of truth and upright judgment.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_25750", "text": "Areopagitica did not persuade the Presbyterians in Parliament to invalidate the prepublication censorship component of the Licensing Order of 1643; freedom of the press in this sense was not achieved until 1695, when the Parliament chose not to renew the order. However, as Milton's treatise has been overwhelmingly praised, but it was unsuccessful because the objective did not appeal to the target audience. Milton and the Presbyterians had together abolished the Star Chamber under Charles I, but now that they were not being oppressed and they held the power, the Presbyterians in Parliament no longer held to their defence of freedom of the press. Through the Licensing Order of 1643, they were set on silencing the more radical Protestants, the Independents as well as works supporting the King which had begun to appear in London. Milton's treatise is his response to that licensing order, which clearly came at a time when he and the Parliament were already at odds.In addition, by the time Milton wrote Areopagitica he had already unsuccessfully challenged Parliament in other areas of privilege and right. Milton's divorce tracts proved too radical for his immediate day, as did this work. Milton's ideas were ahead of his time in the sense that he anticipated the arguments of later advocates of freedom of the press by relating the concept of free will and choice to individual expression and right. Milton's treatise \"laid the foundations for thought that would come after and express itself in such authors as John Locke and John Stuart Mill\".However, although Milton's ideas were initially resisted by the Puritans, they were incorporated into the official charter of the Puritan church within a few years. The Westminster Confession of Faith, written between 1643 and 1650, allows for divorce on two grounds: infidelity and abandonment. The Westminster Confession of Faith states: \"Adultery or fornication, committed after a contract, being detected before marriage, giveth just occasion to the innocent party to dissolve that contract. In the case of adultery after marriage, it is lawful for the innocent party to sue out a divorce, and after the divorce to marry another, as if the offending party were dead.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_25751", "text": "A quotation from Areopagitica is prominently displayed over the entrance to the renovated Main Reading Room of the New York Public Library: \"A good Booke is the precious life-blood of a master spirit, imbalm'd and treasur'd up on purpose to a life beyond life\".The Supreme Court of the United States has referred to Areopagitica, in interpreting the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, to explain the Amendment's protections. The Court has cited Areopagitica by name in four cases. Most notably, the Court cited Areopagitica in the landmark case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan to explain the inherent value of false statements. The Court cited Milton to explain the dangers of prior restraint in Times Film Corporation v. City of Chicago. Later, Justice Douglas concurred in Eisenstadt v. Baird, citing the pamphlet to support striking down restrictions on lecturing about birth control. Finally, Justice Black cited Areopagitica when he dissented from the Court's upholding of restrictions on the Communist Party of the United States against a free speech and free association challenge in Communist Party of the United States v.

There, they discover a time loop with the help of their book The Tales of the Peculiar and escape into it. Surprisingly, it is full of peculiar animals, who embrace and thank them for killing a hollow that had for a long time roamed in the time loop.

She relocates to Wethersfield, Connecticut to live with her Aunt Rachel, Uncle Matthew, and her two cousins, Judith and Mercy, in their Puritan community.\nA brief stop is made in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, to pick up four new passengers. As the small rowboat returns to the ship, a young girl named Prudence accidentally drops her doll in the water and begs her harsh mother, Goodwife Cruff, to get it back for her. Impulsively, Kit jumps into the water and retrieves the doll. She is then met with astonished suspicion, as few white people in Connecticut could swim so well. Cruff is the most skeptical of them all, believing Kit is a witch, commenting, \"No respectable woman could stay afloat like that.\" On the slow trip upriver, Kit befriends John Holbrook, another passenger coming to Wethersfield to study with the Reverend Gershom Bulkeley.  \nKit finds Wethersfield very different from Barbados. Unlike at her previous home, where Kit's family owned servants and slaves, she is expected to work here along with the rest of the family. Her cousin Mercy has a lame leg and is on crutches. Kit is required to attend the Sabbath church meetings twice each Sunday, which she finds dull. Kit meets a rich young man, William Ashby.  He begins courting her, though she does not care for him. Originally, her cousin Judith had hoped to marry William, but she focuses on John Holbrook, a divinity student studying with Bulkeley.\nKit's life improves when she and Mercy begin teaching some young children of Wethersfield, who are preparing for traditional school. Everything proceeds well until one day, bored with the normal lessons, Kit decides the children will reenact a passage from the Bible: the parable of the Good Samaritan. The head of the school, Eleazer Kimberly, enters the house just as things get out of hand. He is outraged at Kit for having the audacity to act out something from the Bible and shuts down the school. Heartbroken, Kit flees to the meadows where she meets and befriends the kind, elderly Hannah Tupper, who was outlawed from the Massachusetts colony because she is a Quaker and does not attend church meetings, as well as being suspected of being a witch. With Hannah's support, Kit convinces Kimberly to give the school another chance.\nAs fellow outcasts, Kit and Hannah develop a deep bond, and even after her uncle forbids Kit to continue the friendship, she keeps visiting Hannah. During one of her visits, Kit again meets the handsome Nathaniel (Nat) Eaton, son of the captain of the Dolphin. Without realizing it, she falls in love with him, and though he doesn't say so, Nat reciprocates. Unfortunately, Nat is banished from Wethersfield after setting lit jack-o-lanterns in the windows of William Ashby's unfinished home. Nat is threatened with 30 lashes if he returns to Wethersfield. Kit also begins secretly teaching Prudence to read and write; Goodwife Cruff claims the child is a half-wit and \"stupid\" and refuses to allow her to attend the dame school.\nWhen a deadly illness sweeps through Wethersfield, a mob gathers to kill Hannah by burning her house. Kit rushes to warn Hannah, and the two women escape to the river just as the Dolphin appears from the early morning mist. Kit flags it down.  Nat takes Hannah aboard and invites Kit to come with them. She refuses, explaining that Mercy is gravely ill, though Nat believes Kit fears losing her engagement to William Ashby.\nAfter the Dolphin sails away, Kit returns home to find that Mercy's fever has broken. In the middle of the same night, the townspeople come for Kit; Goodwife Cruff's husband has accused her of being a witch. The next day, after a freezing night in the sheriff's shed, Kit is asked to explain the presence of her hornbook in Hannah's house and a copybook with Prudence's name written throughout, as the townspeople fear that she and Hannah were casting a spell over the girl. Kit refuses to reveal that Prudence wrote her own name, as Kit does not wish to cause the girl trouble with her parents. \nJust as Kit seems to be declared guilty, Nat appears with Prudence, who testifies that Kit was only giving her lessons. To demonstrate her literacy, Prudence reads a Bible passage and writes her name, thus convincing her father both that she is intelligent, and that no witchcraft could be involved, as the devil would be foolish to allow a child to be taught to use the Bible against herself. While Nat is initially in trouble for returning and evades capture, Kit's Uncle Matthew intervenes on his behalf and gets the punishment dropped as a reward for Nat returning to see justice done at great risk to himself.\nSoon after, Kit breaks off her engagement to William.  Two engagements are announced: Mercy to John Holbrook and Judith to William Ashby. Kit decides to return to Barbados. However, she decides to talk to Nat first after finally realizing that she's in love with him. Nat returns to Wethersfield with a surprise: he is the captain of a new boat.

Several countries send their official delegates, but the auction is won by a representative from an anonymous United States buyer.\nAfter the auction closes, the mysterious buyer is revealed to be Barbicane and Co., a company founded by Impey Barbicane, J.T. Maston and Captain Nicholl \u2014 the same members of the Baltimore Gun Club who, twenty years earlier, had traveled around the Moon inside a large cannon shell. The brave gunmen-astronauts had come out of their retirement with an even more ambitious engineering project: using the recoil of a huge cannon to remove the tilt of the Earth's axis \u2014 so that it would become perpendicular to the planet's orbit, like Jupiter's.\nThat change would bring an end to seasons, as day and night would be always equal and each place would have the same climate all year round. The society's interest lay in another effect of the recoil: a displacement of the Earth's rotation axis, that would bring the lands around the North Pole, which they had secured in the auction, to latitude 67 north. Then the vast coal deposits that were conjectured to exist under the ice could be easily mined and sold. The technical feasibility of the plan had been confirmed by J. T. Maston's computations. The necessary capital had been provided by Ms. Evangelina Scorbitt, a wealthy widow and ardent admirer of Maston.\nThe cannon needed for that plan would be enormous, much larger than the huge Columbiad that had sent them to the Moon. Once the plan became public, the brilliant French engineer Alcide Pierdeux quickly computes the required force of the explosion. He then discovers that the recoil would buckle the Earth's crust; many countries (mostly in Asia) would be flooded, while others (including the United States) would gain new land.\nAlcide's note sends the world into panic and rage, and authorities promptly rush to stop the project. However Barbicane and Nicholl had left America for destination unknown, to supervise the completion and firing of the monster gun. J. T. Maston is caught and jailed, but he is unwilling or unable to reveal the cannon's location. Frantic searches around the world fail to find it either.\nThe cannon in fact had been dug deep into the flanks of Mount Kilimanjaro, by a small army of workers provided by a local sultan who was an enthusiastic fan of the former Moon explorers. The projectile, a steel-braced chunk of rock weighing 180,000 tons, would exit the barrel at the fantastic speed of 2,800 kilometres per second \u2014 thanks to a new powerful explosive invented by Nicholl, which he had called \"melimelonite\".\nThe cannon is fired as planned, and the explosion causes huge damage in the immediate vicinity. However, the Earth's axis retains its tilt and position, and not the slightest tremor is felt in the rest of the world.  Alcide, shortly before the cannon was fired, had discovered that J. T. Maston, while computing the size of the cannon, had made a calculation error; he had accidentally erased three zeros from the blackboard when he was struck by lightning during a telephone call from Ms. Scorbitt. Because of that single mistake, twelve zeros got omitted from the result. Because Maston's calculations were undoubtedly considered correct when they were discovered, this error was not discovered early enough. The cannon he designed was indeed far too small: a trillion of them would have had to be fired to achieve the intended effect.\nRidiculed by the whole world and bearing the bitter resentment of his two associates, J. T. Maston goes back into retirement, vowing to never again make any mathematical calculations. Ms. Scorbitt finally declares her feelings to Maston, and he gladly surrenders to marriage.

The ostensible subject is the siege of Paris in 1589 by Henry III in concert with Henry of Navarre, soon to be Henry IV, but its themes are the twin evils of religious fanaticism and civil discord. It also concerns the political state of France. Voltaire aimed to be the French Virgil, outdoing the master by preserving Aristotelian unity of place\u2014a property of classical tragedy rather than epic\u2014by keeping the human action confined between Paris and Ivry.

These \"fictions\", as Voltaire calls them, mostly relate to Henry IV, and \"draw from the regions of the marvelous\", and include \"the prediction of Henry's conversion, of the protection given to him by Saint Louis, his apparition, the fire from Heaven destroying those magical performances which were then so common, etc.\" Voltaire also stated that various other sections of the poem were purely allegorical: \"for example, the voyage of Discord to Rome, Politics and Fanaticism personified, the temple of Love, the Passions and Vices, etc.\"The poem was written in a reformed styling of the twelve-syllable alexandrine couplet. He made this stylised hexameter for dramatic effect. Some commentators remarked that this particular rhythm of verse was unsuited to the content and theme of the poem. According to the poem's editor O. R. Taylor, the poem \"rarely touches the sensibility of the modern reader\" and readers hoping for sublime fire will be disappointed, though Voltaire's verse is always idiomatic and never pedestrian. Voltaire's English Essay upon the Civil Wars in France. Extracted from Curious Manuscripts (1727) expresses his Enlightened opinions on these themes in a prose form that is more approachable to modern taste.\nO. R. Taylor's critical edition of La Henriade devotes a full volume to an introduction, accounting for the germination of the idea and its publication history, the contextual theory of the epic and sources both literary and in recent history and contemporary events, and the nineteenth-century decline in the poem's popularity.

Stripped of all he has for protesting against the Governor of Malta's seizure of the wealth of the country's whole Jewish population to pay off the warring Turks, he develops a murderous streak by, with the help of his slave Ithamore, tricking the Governor's son and his friend into fighting over the affections of his daughter, Abigail. When they both die in a duel, he becomes further incensed when Abigail, horrified at what her father has done, runs away to become a Christian nun. In retribution, Barabas then goes on to poison her along with the whole of the nunnery, strangles an old friar (Barnadine) who tries to make him repent for his sins and then frames another friar (Jacomo) for the first friar's murder. After Ithamore falls in love with a prostitute who conspires with her criminal friend to blackmail and expose him (after Ithamore drunkenly tells them everything his master has done), Barabas poisons all three of them. When he is caught, he drinks \"of poppy and cold mandrake juice\" so that he will be left for dead, and then plots with the enemy Turks to besiege the city.\nWhen at last Barabas is nominated governor by his new allies, he switches sides to the Christians once again. Having devised a trap for the Turks' galley slaves and soldiers in which they will all be demolished by gunpowder, he then sets a trap for the Turkish prince himself and his men, hoping to boil them alive in a hidden cauldron.

The script of this performance included additions by S. Penley. It was considered a successful production at the time. However, in an anonymous biography of Kean published seventeen years later, it suggests that the success of the production came from Kean's performance and his addition of a song to the role of Barabas, and that the play itself, on its own, was a failure.On 2 October 1993, Ian McDiarmid starred as Barabas in a BBC Radio 3 adaptation of the play directed by Michael Fox, with Ken Bones as Machevil and Ferneze, Kathryn Hunt as Abigail, Michael Grandage as Don Lodowick, Neal Swettenham as Don Mathias and Kieran Cunningham as Ithamore.", "hasanswer": false}]}

On 18 December that year, the Stationers Company ruled that both Jeffes and White had broken the guild's rules by printing works that belonged to the other; both men were fined 10 shillings, and the offending books were destroyed so that Q1 of The Spanish Tragedy survives in only a single copy. Yet the Q1 title page refers to an even earlier edition; this was probably by Jeffes, and no known copy exists.The popular play was reprinted in 1594. In an apparent compromise between the competing booksellers, the title page of Q2 credits the edition to \"Abell Jeffes, to be sold by Edward White\". On 13 August 1599, Jeffes transferred his copyright to William White, who issued the third edition that year. White in turn transferred the copyright to Thomas Pavier on 14 August 1600 and Pavier issued the fourth edition (printed for him by William White) in 1602.

Kid\". The style of The Spanish Tragedy is considered such a good match with Kyd's style in his other extant play, Cornelia (1593), that scholars and critics have universally recognised Kyd's authorship.In 2013, scholar Douglas Bruster theorised that some awkward wordings in the \"Additional Passages\" of the 1602 fourth edition resulted from printers' errors in setting type from the (now lost) original manuscript. Furthermore, after examining the \"Hand D\" manuscript (widely accepted as in Shakespeare's handwriting) from the play Sir Thomas More, Bruster argued that the speculated printers' errors resulted from reading a manuscript written by someone with Shakespeare's \"messy\" handwriting, thus bolstering the likelihood that Shakespeare wrote the Additional Passages.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_25864", "text": "Figures in the FrameThe ghost of Don Andrea\nAn embodiment of RevengeSpainThe Spanish King\nDon Cyprian, Duke of Castile, the King's brother\nDon Lorenzo, the Duke of Castile's son\nBel-imperia, the Duke of Castile's daughter\nPedringano, Bel-imperia's servant\nChristophil, Don Lorenzo's servant\nDon Lorenzo's page boy\nDon Hieronimo, Knight Marshal of Spain\nIsabella, his wife\nDon Horatio, their son\nA servant to Don Hieronimo\nA maid to Isabella\nDon Bazulto, an elderly man\nGeneral of the Spanish army\nThree watchmen\nA deputy\nA hangman\nA messenger\nThree citizensPortugalThe Portuguese Viceroy\nPrince Balthazar, his son\nDon Pedro, the Viceroy's brother\nAlexandro and Villuppo, Portuguese noblemen\nThe Portuguese Ambassador\nSerberine, Balthazar's serving-man\nTwo noblemen of Portugal\nTwo Portuguese citizens (Portingales)In Hieronimo's playSoliman, Sultan of Turkey (played by Balthazar)\nErasto (\"Erastus\"), Knight of Rhodes (played by Lorenzo)\nBashaw (played by Hieronimo)\nPerseda (played by Bel-imperia)", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_25865", "text": "Before the play begins, the Viceroy of Portugal rebelled against Spanish rule. A battle took place in which the Portuguese were defeated and their leader, the Viceroy's son Balthazar, killed the Spanish officer Andrea before being taken captive by the Spanish. Andrea's ghost and the personification Revenge itself are present onstage throughout the entirety of the play and serve as chorus. At the end of each act, Andrea bemoans the series of injustices that have taken place and then Revenge reassures him that those deserving will get their comeuppance. The Ghost of Andrea and Revenge open the play in Act 1 and close the play in Act 5 with descriptions of the Classical underworld. There is also a subplot concerning the enmity of two Portuguese noblemen, one of whom attempts to convince the Viceroy that his rival has murdered the missing Balthazar.\nThe King's nephew Lorenzo and Andrea's best friend Horatio dispute over who captured Balthazar. Though it is made clear early on that Horatio defeated Balthazar and Lorenzo has essentially cheated his way into taking partial credit, the King leaves Balthazar in Lorenzo's charge and splits the spoils of the victory between the two. Horatio comforts Lorenzo's sister, Bel-imperia, who was in love with Andrea against her family's wishes. Despite her former feelings for Andrea, Bel-imperia soon falls for Horatio. She confesses that her love for Horatio is motivated partially by her desire for revenge: Bel-imperia intends to torment Balthazar, who killed her former lover Andrea.\nMeanwhile, Balthazar is falling in love with Bel-imperia. The Spanish king decides that a marriage between Balthazar and Bel-imperia would be an excellent way to repair the peace with Portugal. Horatio's father, the Marshal Hieronimo, stages an entertainment for the Portuguese ambassador. Lorenzo, suspecting that Bel-imperia has found a new lover, bribes her servant Pedringano and discovers that Horatio is the man. He persuades Balthazar to help him murder Horatio during an assignation with Bel-imperia. Hieronimo and his wife Isabella find the body of their son hanged and stabbed, and Isabella is driven mad. (Revisions made to the original play supplement the scene with Hieronimo briefly losing his wits as well.)\nLorenzo locks Bel-imperia away, but she succeeds in sending Hieronimo a letter, written in her own blood, informing him that Lorenzo and Balthazar were Horatio's murderers. Hieronimo's questions and attempts to see Bel-imperia convince Lorenzo that he knows something. Afraid that Balthazar's servant Serberine has revealed the truth, Lorenzo convinces Pedringano to murder Serberine, then arranges for Pedringano's arrest in the hopes of silencing him too. Hieronimo, appointed judge, sentences Pedringano to death. Pedringano expects Lorenzo to procure his pardon, and Lorenzo, having written a fake letter of pardon, lets him believe this right up until the hangman drops Pedringano to his death.\nLorenzo manages to prevent Hieronimo from seeking justice by convincing the King that Horatio is alive and well. Furthermore, Lorenzo does not allow Hieronimo to see the King, claiming that he is too busy. This, combined with his wife Isabella's suicide, pushes Hieronimo past his limit. He rants incoherently and digs at the ground with his dagger. Lorenzo goes on to tell his uncle, the King, that Hieronimo's odd behaviour is due to his inability to deal with his son Horatio's newfound wealth (Balthazar's ransom from the Portuguese Viceroy), and he has gone mad with jealousy. Regaining his senses, Hieronimo, along with Bel-imperia, feigns reconciliation with the murderers, and asks them to join him in putting on a play, Soliman and Perseda, to entertain the court.\nWhen the play is performed, Hieronimo uses real daggers instead of prop daggers, so that Lorenzo and Balthazar are stabbed to death in front of the King, Viceroy, and Duke (Lorenzo and Bel-imperia's father). He cast the play in such a way that both himself and Bel-imperia could exact their own revenge by actually killing the murderers. Bel-imperia chooses to stab herself during the play too, although this was not Hieronimo's intention for her.\nHieronimo tells everyone of the motive behind the murders, bites out his own tongue to prevent himself from talking under torture, and kills the Duke of Castille and then himself. Andrea and Revenge are satisfied, and promise to deliver suitable eternal punishments to the guilty parties.", "hasanswer": false}]}

(Chapter I.1)\nAfter defrauding Twango of a substantial sum, only to be double-crossed by Yelleg and Malser, Twango's \"scale divers\", Cugel absconds from Flutic, still in possession of the Skybreak Spatterlight. At the nearby port of Saskervoy he takes employment as a lowly worminger (a crew member responsible for the maintenance of huge marine worms) aboard the worm-propelled  Galante, a merchant ship owned by Soldinck and Mercantides, hoping to reach Almery by sea. On the island of Lausicaa, where he is to be replaced by a more competent worminger and thus remain stranded, Cugel hijacks the Galante, kidnapping Soldinck's wife and three comely daughters. Madame Soldinck, to whom Cugel naively entrusts the duties of night helmsman, outwits her captor by turning the ship in the opposite direction every night while Cugel is asleep after dallying with her daughters. To evade retribution at the hands of Master Soldinck, who is pursuing the Galante in a lubberly cog, Cugel runs the ship aground on the Tustvold mud flats and wades ashore. (Chapters I.2, II.1, II.2, II.3)\nAt the nearby village of Tustvold he falls in with a quarryman and antiquarian named Nisbet, whose trade is the construction of columns atop which the idle husbands of the industrious village women bask in the rays of the dying sun. The height of the columns is a status symbol and so the village women vie with each other to have Nisbet erect taller and taller columns for their husbands. With the aid of Nisbet's gravity-repellent boot dressing, Cugel comes up with a scheme whereby he surreptitiously removes the bottom segments of every column in order to resell them to the women. The ruse is discovered and he flees the village before the women can lynch him. (Chapter III.1)\nTravelling onward, in the countryside between Tustvold and Port Perdusz, Cugel narrowly avoids a sticky end at the manse of Faucelme, a magician who recognises the Skybreak Spatterlight and, when Cugel refuses to part with it, attempts various underhand ways of doing away with its present owner. Arriving at Port Perdusz, Cugel discovers that sea passage to Almery is impossible. Using Nisbet's magical boot dressing to render it immune to gravity, Cugel steals a ship, the Avventura, and joins a caravan led by Varmous. The caravan, towing the Avventura and its \"premium\" passengers through the air, arrives, after various adventures, in Kaspara Vitatus, the City of Monuments, where the vessel's original owner, Captain Wiskich, and his crew finally catch up with it. (Chapters III.2, IV.1, IV.2)\nCugel flees across a barren waste known as the Pale Rugates and finally comes to the town of Gundar, the site of the last remaining Solar Emosynaries, who stimulate the combustion of the dying sun by projecting the heat of a fire at the solar orb through a contraption made of lenses. Cugel manages to gain employment as a night watchman guarding a caravan conveying seventeen virgins south to the temple city of Lumarth. At Lumarth, however, the College of Thurists discover that only two of the seventeen maidens are still virgins. Obliged to expiate his crime, Cugel is sent down into the depths of the temple of the demon Phampoun. Conversing with Pulsifer, a homunculus growing on the end of Phampoun's tongue, Cugel realises that all those who have preceded him have been eaten, but only after regaling the demon with lurid tales of their misdeeds. By inveiglement, he persuades Pulsifer to visit the upper world. On ascending to the temple above, the gigantic Phampoun, who is violently sensitive to light, awakes and runs amok, demolishing the city. (Chapter V.1)\nCugel escapes by water, down the River Chaim, as far as the Tsombol Marsh. After crossing the Plain of Standing Stones, Cugel rescues a certain Iolo from a pelgrane, only to be caught by a tentacle that emerges from a hole in the ground, a breach into an otherworld created by a magical adjunct worn by the pelgrane. Iolo, more of a swindler even than Cugel, refuses to assist his erstwhile rescuer and composes himself to sleep; during the night Cugel manages to steal Iolo's bagful of dreams and secretes it within the hole into another dimension. In the morning, Iolo releases Cugel from the grip of the tentacle when he promises to help him catch the supposed thief. They travel to Cuirnif, where Iolo had been hoping to exhibit his dream crystals at Duke Orbal's Grand Exposition. Cugel transports the hole to Cuirnif, which he exhibits, giving it the title \"Nowhere\". However, he is forced to enter his own exhibit in order to retrieve Iolo's bagful of dreams. The dream crystals, contaminated with the alien stuff of the otherworld, cause Duke Orbal violently unpleasant visions when he samples them in order to judge the winner of the Grand Exposition. (Chapter V.2)\nCugel leaves Cuirnif in a hurry. He finally reaches Almery, where Iucounu repeatedly attempts to steal the Skybreak Spatterlight from him, but is thwarted because the scale absorbs all the magical spells aimed at Cugel. Finally, Cugel fools Iucounu, who has clothed himself in the scales of Sadlark ready to become one with the Overworld entity, into touching his forehead with the Skybreak Spatterlight; Iucounu is instantly absorbed, annihilated. The now complete Sadlark attempts to catch Cugel but stumbles into a fountain and the water dissolves the bonds of force linking together his scales. Cugel is left in possession of Iucounu's manse, Pergolo.

It took nearly eight years for the book to be published. Going back and forth with Richards, who initially agreed to publish his work, Joyce revised and omitted many things in the book to reach an agreement. However, Richards objected to too many things and eventually simply refused to publish Dubliners at all.Ireland had been under the rule of Great Britain since the sixteenth century. A movement for home rule, greater autonomy, began in the late nineteenth century. In \"Ivy Day in the Committee Room,\" Joyce touches on the deep-rooted political struggle by noting nationalist Charles Stewart Parnell and his role in Irish politics. His representation in \"Ivy Day\" is clear from the title of the story: Ivy Day is the anniversary of the death of Parnell, the \"uncrowned king of Ireland.\" Parnell wanted to give the Irish people a greater role in the management of their own affairs.\nParnell's ousting from power served to delay Irish independence. In \"Ivy Day in the Committee Room\", the campaigners for Tierney are not campaigning for him to get into office, but rather as a way for them to earn money. They acknowledge, however, that \u201cSome of those hillsiders and Fenians are a bit too clever if you ask me... Do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers?

The inactivity in \u201cIvy Day in the Committee Room\u201d serves to show Joyce\u2019s view of Irish nationalism. The stagnant conversations speak to Ireland\u2019s paralytic nature. Nothing being accomplished in this story reflects the fact that nothing was being done about obtaining Ireland\u2019s independence.\nAfter Parnell's death, an Irish cultural and political movement was set into motion, through which citizens tried to figure out what it meant to live in Ireland with strong Irish roots. Ireland was split into segregated religious groups (Catholics versus Protestants), but most Irish were Catholic and wanted independence from Britain, as opposed to the mostly-Protestants conservatives, who were in favor of staying under British rule. The two pillars of this Irish nationalism were the Catholic faith and pride in Ireland's Gaelic cultural heritage, which led to a renewed interest in the Irish language.

Lloyd's elderly parents, \"Pops\" and Carmelita live with him.  Carmelita is terminally ill and takes up much of Helen's time, while \"Pops\" has mental health issues that are never fully explained.  Chris meets a friend of Lloyd's named Harold, a boy close to Chris' age who has a solid muscular build like Lloyd.  Chris bonds with Harold, but Lloyd's brash, street smart demeanor puts Chris off.  Harold, aware of the tension, tries to diffuse things between them by sharing with Chris the fact that he too was awkward and underweight, but Lloyd helped him build his confidence and eat the right foods.\nThrough all this is a subplot involving the relationship that Chris has with his mother.  One particularly humiliating ritual for Chris is her making him urinate in a milk bottle in cases where they have to share a bathroom with her patient's family.  Lloyd particularly enjoys taunting Chris with this knowledge (as well as Chris' obsession with the overccoat), especially after he discovers that Helen has been stealing household goods and food from their pantry.

Pohl and Bradbury wanted Asimov to write a juvenile science fiction novel that would serve as the basis for a television series. Fearing that the novel would be adapted into the \"uniformly awful\" programming he saw flooding the television channels, he decided to publish it under the pseudonym \"Paul French\".\nAsimov began work on the novel, David Starr: Space Ranger, on 10 June.

A seventh, Lucky Starr and the Snows of Pluto, was planned, but abandoned when Asimov elected to devote himself to writing non-fiction almost exclusively. With no worries about being associated with an embarrassing televised version, Asimov decided to abandon the pretense that he was not the author (although the books continued to be published under the Paul French pseudonym). He brought the Three Laws of Robotics into Lucky Starr and the Big Sun of Mercury, which he wrote in his autobiography \"was a dead giveaway to Paul French's identity for even the most casual reader\".Eventually, Asimov used his own name in later editions.

The conflict between the two men spills into the real world in a decades-long feud, distorting reality and affecting the entire human race.\nClive Barker has said in interviews that this novel was the hardest to write of all his books.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_26045", "text": "In 1969, while working in a dead letter office in Nebraska, disgruntled postal clerk Randolph Jaffe discovers hints to a mysterious society known as The Shoal, which ostensibly practises a form of magic only vaguely known as \"The Art\". Jaffe's search eventually brings him to a New Mexico town where he encounters Kissoon, who claims to be the last of the Shoal. Kissoon tells Jaffe of the mystical dream sea Quiddity and the islands within it known as the Ephemeris. Quiddity, as it turns out, is visible exactly three times to an ordinary human: The first time we ever sleep outside our mother's womb, the first time we sleep beside the one we truly love and the last time we ever sleep before we die. However, this simply is not enough for the megalomaniac Jaffe, who wishes to actually visit the dream sea in person and gain control of it. Jaffe flees when Kissoon tries to bargain for his body.\nJaffe later teams up with a scientist named Fletcher to develop a liquid called Nuncio, which can theoretically allow a human to evolve to a state that would enable him to physically reach Quiddity. Fletcher realises that Jaffe will only use Nuncio for evil and destroys his laboratory. Jaffe arrives and both are exposed to the Nuncio. After the two battle each other for a year, their spirits arrive in California and topple into a crack in the earth near the town of Palomo Grove. From there, they energize extreme sexual desires into four local teenage girls. The four girls seek out various partners in their community and become impregnated. One of the girls is infertile and fails to conceive while another kills herself and her child after giving birth. The third, Trudi Katz, moves away with her baby Howard, while the fourth, Joyce McGuire, gives birth to twins, Jo-Beth and Tommy Ray.\nEighteen years pass. Howard returns to California after the death of his mother. While Jaffe and Fletcher produced offspring to continue their battle, Howard and Jo-Beth instead fall in love after meeting. Fletcher and Jaffe are able to escape their captivity, locked into the crack in the earth. Jaffe is able to amass an army of creatures known as Terata using the minds of vulnerable people, and gets his son Tommy Ray on his side as well. Howard encounters Fletcher, who explains his heritage to him. Fletcher explains Quiddity to Howard, telling him that the Ephemeris contain the Great and Secret Show, but Howard refuses to align with his father. Meanwhile, a reporter named Grillo and his friend, Tesla, arrive in town. Fletcher is unable to amass his own army of hallucigenia from the mind of dreamers and instead kills himself through immolation, spreading his essence to the people of the town.\nHaving encountered Fletcher before his death, Tesla heads to the remnants of his laboratory to recover the remains of the Nuncio. Tommy Ray is sent by Jaffe. While there Tesla encounters Raul, an ape who had been evolved through the power of the Nuncio. Tommy Ray arrives and shoots Tesla, but the last remaining vial of Nuncio breaks, infecting both men. Tesla's consciousness travels to a time loop in New Mexico where she encounters Kissoon. Kissoon explains to Tesla that the Shoal were dedicated to keeping Quiddity and the Art pure but with them all dead, Earth (known as the Cosm) could be dominated by the evil race Iad Uroboros, who live in the Metacosm on the opposite side of Quiddity. Tesla leaves when Kissoon tries to take over her body but agrees to find another body for him to inhabit. Leaving the time loop, Tesla encounters a woman named Mary Muralles, who reveals that it was Kissoon who murdered the Shoal and he is actually an agent of the Iad Uroboros. Kissoon manages to kill Mary using snake-like creatures created by his excrement and semen (Lix), then captures Raul to take over his body.\nTommy Ray leads an army of the dead while the hallucigenia created by Fletcher's death convince Howard to help them attack Jaffe. Jaffe manages to tear a hole through reality into Quiddity but realises it is too much power for him to deal with. As his Terata battle the hallucigenia many are dragged into Quiddity including Howard, Jo-Beth and Tommy Ray. Tesla, Grillo and Jaffe flee the house and attempt to close the vortex into Quiddity. Quiddity transforms Howard, Jo-Beth and Tommy Ray as they reach the Ephemeris, where they find that the Iad Uroboros are crossing Quiddity towards Earth.\nThe town starts to collapse and is sealed off by the authorities. Tesla recalls a word Kissoon had brought up, \"Trinity\", which is the place where the first atomic bomb was detonated. Kissoon arrives, now occupying Raul's body, but Jaffe is able to distract him as Tesla transports the vortex to Quiddity into Kissoon's time loop. Howard, Jo-Beth and Tommy Ray, completely transformed from their experience in Quiddity, return from the vortex. Jaffe is able to kill Raul's body and is reunited with Tommy Ray. Tesla finds that Raul has occupied Kissoon's former body. By convincing Raul's consciousness to enter her body, Kissoon's body dies, which disintegrates the time loop, destroys the vortex to Quiddity and the Iad Uroboros who were arriving. Tesla and the others are able to escape the time loop just in time.\nJo-Beth and Howard meet supernatural investigator Harry D'Amour, who asks for their story.

Additionally, Chaucer drew on John Gower's Confessio Amantis and the biblical story of Jephtha for inspiration. \nAlthough difficult to date like most of Chaucer's tales, the Physician's tale is usually regarded as an early work of Chaucer-- probably written before much of the rest of the Canterbury Tales. Some scholars believe it may have originally been intended for Chaucer's poem The Legend of Good Women instead. The long digression on governesses possibly alludes to a historical event and may serve to date it. In 1386, Elizabeth, the daughter of John of Gaunt, eloped to France with John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. Elizabeth's governess was Katherine Swynford, who was also Gaunt's mistress and later wife. Chaucer's words on the virtues of governesses were potentially influenced by this scandal.The Physician's Tale is widely considered by Chaucerian scholars to be a failure, largely due to its convoluted moral message. However, the story is still considered one of the moral tales, along with the Parson's Tale and the Knight's Tale.

The story opens with a description of the noble Virginius and his daughter, the beautiful, virtuous Virginia who is 14 years old. One day, Virginia accompanies her mother to the city on an errand and is spotted by a judge, whose name is later revealed to be Appius. Upon seeing her, Appius is filled with lust and decides he must have her. When his plans to woo her fail, he then concocts a scheme to legally take her for himself. He contacts a local peasant named Claudius, who has a reputation for being both bold and cunning, and asks for assistance in the matter. Claudius accepts and is rewarded handsomely. Some time later, Claudius appears before Appius in court to file a complaint against Virginius, saying he has witnesses of his misdeeds. Appius declares that he cannot try Virginius without him being present.

Chaucer's goal in giving Virginia a choice in his version of the tale is unclear. Farber also points out a flaw in Virginius's ultimatum of death or dishonor: \"these alternatives are problematic because there would presumably be many other ways to deal with the situation: Virginia could run away; she could go into hiding; Virginius could stall for time while he called together all their friends who were pointedly mentioned when we were introduced to Virginius; and on and on.\"Some argue that the purpose of Virginia's death is to highlight Virginius's ineptitude as a father. Farber states that Virginius's ultimatum to his daughter would not have been seen as the proper action for a father to take: \"it turns out, audiences of the story other than the Host tend to agree, that this is bad governance.\" However, Farber also argues in the other direction saying that \"the responsibility does not lie entirely with Virginius: Virginia embraces her father's logic as well as his power and, voicing both, consents to her own death.\"Many critics and theorists have also analyzed the value and impact of Virginia's sacrifice in the tale. Daniel T. Kline, in his essay \"Jephthah's Daughter and Chaucer's Virginia: The Critique of Sacrifice in The Physician's Tale\", asserts that \"the Physician's Tale should be read in light not of traditional hagiographical narrative, in which sacrificial death is socially valorized and theologically naturalized, but in view of the account of Jephthah's daughter in Judges 11, a Biblical tale in which the daughter's sacrifice is neither lauded nor condemned.\" In short, Kline states that Virginia's sacrifice was not something noble but rather a tragic result of a series of unfortunate events.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26097", "text": "Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus pays homage to this tale.

In a desperate attempt to save the fetus, Cordelia has it transferred to a uterine replicator\u2014an artificial womb\u2014to undergo experimental treatment that may partially combat the otherwise-fatal bone damage.

This novel is of particular interest to scholars because Dumas reused many of the ideas and plot devices in The Count of Monte Cristo.Dumas wrote that the germ of the idea of revenge as one theme in his novel The Count of Monte Cristo came from an anecdote (Le Diamant et la Vengeance) published in a memoir of incidents in France in 1838, written by an archivist of the Paris police. The archivist was Jacques Peuchet, and the multi-volume book was called Memoirs from the Archives of the Paris Police in English. Dumas included this essay in one of the editions of his novel published in 1846.Peuchet related the tale of a shoemaker, Pierre Picaud, living in N\u00eemes in 1807, who was engaged to marry a rich woman when three jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy on behalf of England in a period of wars between France and England. Picaud was placed under a form of house arrest in the Fenestrelle Fort, where he served as a servant to a rich Italian cleric. When the cleric died, he left his fortune to Picaud, whom he had begun to treat as a son. Picaud then spent years plotting his revenge on the three men who were responsible for his misfortune. He stabbed the first with a dagger on which the words \"Number One\" were printed, and then he poisoned the second. The third man's son he lured into crime and his daughter into prostitution, finally stabbing the man himself. This third man, named Loupian, had married Picaud's fianc\u00e9e while Picaud was under arrest.In another of the true stories reported by Ashton-Wolfe, Peuchet describes a poisoning in a family. This story is also mentioned in the Pl\u00e9iade edition of this novel, and it probably served as a model for the chapter of the murders inside the Villefort family. The introduction to the Pl\u00e9iade edition mentions other sources from real life:  a man named Abb\u00e9 Faria existed, was imprisoned but did not die in prison; he died in 1819 and left no large legacy to anyone.

The socman threatens a lovely maiden, Maude, who escapes with Alleyne's aid and they flee on foot to find her horse. Maude makes a striking impression on the abbey-raised young man. When she hears that Alleyne intends to rejoin his friends to approach Sir Nigel Loring, Maude laughs and leaves him. Alleyne meets up again with Aylward and Hordle John, and the three friends meet Sir Nigel and his formidable wife Mary. There, he learns that Maude is Sir Nigel's daughter. Alleyne is taken on as squire to Sir Nigel and as tutor to Maude. When the men eventually depart for France, the young couple admit their love, but only to each other. En route to Gascony, our heroes destroy pirates, then report to the court of the Prince of Wales in Bordeaux.\nAfter adventures fearful and funny, the valiant fighters lead the White Company to join the Prince. A letter arrives to Sir Nigel declaring that Alleyne's brother, the Socman of Minstead, had attacked Sir Nigel's castle. During the siege, the socman died. This news means that Alleyne is the new socman and emboldens him to declare his love for Maude to Sir Nigel. Sir Nigel is startled by the news and Alleyne's declaration, but indicates that he prefers that Alleyne should be a full knight before he approaches Maude again with talk of love. The Spanish and French attack them in a narrow ravine, where the mighty warriors are almost all destroyed and the Company must disband\u2014only seven bowmen remain, including John. Alleyne was badly wounded when Sir Nigel sent him to alert the Prince to their plight. Sir Nigel and Aylward are missing and presumed dead. The English go on to win the Battle of N\u00e1jera, fulfilling the mission. The Prince knights Alleyne in his sick bed. Alleyne returns to England victorious with John as his squire, only to learn from a lady on the road that Maude and her mother had news that none of the White Company had survived. The lady said that love of a \"golden-haired squire\", who was presumed dead with the fighters, had caused Maude to decide to join a nunnery. The lady had left just before Maude was to take the veil. Alleyne rushes to the doors of the nunnery and he and Maude embrace. They marry. Alleyn and John prepare to return to find out what happened to Sir Nigel and Aylward.

It is set in 91 BC, when Lucius Licinius Crassus dies, just before the Social War and the civil war between Marius and Sulla, during which Marcus Antonius (orator), the other great orator of this dialogue, dies. During this year, the author faces a difficult political situation: after his return from exile in Dyrrachium (modern Albania), his house was destroyed by the gangs of Clodius in a time when violence was common.  This was intertwined with the street politics of Rome.Amidst the moral and political decadence of the state, Cicero wrote De Oratore to describe the ideal orator and imagine him as a moral guide of the state. He did not intend De Oratore as merely a treatise on rhetoric, but went beyond mere technique to make several references to philosophical principles. Cicero believed that the power of persuasion\u2014the ability to verbally manipulate opinion in crucial political decisions\u2014was a key issue and that in the hands of an unprincipled orator, this power would endanger the entire community.\nAs a consequence, moral principles can be taken either by the examples of noble men of the past or by the great Greek philosophers, who provided ethical ways to be followed in their teaching and their works.\nThe perfect orator shall be not merely a skilled speaker without moral principles, but both an expert of rhetorical technique and a man of wide knowledge in law, history, and ethical principles.\nDe Oratore is an exposition of issues, techniques, and divisions in rhetoric; it is also a parade of examples for several of them and it makes continuous references to philosophical concepts to be merged for a perfect result.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_26202", "text": "At the time when Cicero wrote the dialogue, the crisis of the state concerned everyone.

He expresses all his pain to his brother Quintus Cicero. He reminds him that only nine days after the dialogue, described in this work, Crassus died suddenly. He came back to Rome the last day of the ludi scaenici (19 September 91 BC), very worried by the speech of the consul Lucius Marcius Philippus. He made a speech before the people, claiming the creation of a new council in place of the Roman Senate, with which he could not govern the State any longer. Crassus went to the curia (the palace of the Senate) and heard the speech of Drusus, reporting Lucius Marcius Philippus' speech and attacking him.\nIn that occasion, everyone agreed that Crassus, the best orator of all, overcame himself with his eloquence. He blamed the situation and the abandonment of the Senate: the consul, who should be his good father and faithful defender, was depriving it of its dignity like a robber. No need of surprise, indeed, if he wanted to deprive the State of the Senate, after having ruined the first one with his disastrous projects.\nPhilippus was a vigorous, eloquent and smart man: when he was attacked by the Crassus' firing words, he counter-attacked him until he made him keep silent. But Crassus replied:\" You, who destroyed the authority of the Senate before the Roman people, do you really think to intimidate me? If you want to keep me silent, you have to cut my tongue. And even if you do it, my spirit of freedom will hold tight your arrogance\".\nCrassus' speech lasted a long time and he spent all of his spirit, his mind and his forces. Crassus' resolution was approved by the Senate, stating that \"not the authority nor the loyalty of the Senate ever abandoned the Roman State\". When he was speaking, he had a pain in his side and, after he came home, he got fever and died of pleurisy in six days.\n\"How insecure is the destiny of a man!\", Cicero says. Just in the peak of his public career, Crassus reached the top of the authority, but also destroyed all his expectations and plans for the future by his death.\nThis sad episode caused pain, not only to Crassus' family, but also to all the honest citizens. Cicero adds that, in his opinion, the immortal gods gave Crassus his death as a gift, to preserve him from seeing the calamities that would befall the State a short time later. Indeed, he has not seen Italy burning by the social war (91-87 BC), neither the people's hate against the Senate, the escape and return of Gaius Marius, the following revenges, killings and violence.", "hasanswer": false}]}

None of these now close friends have met before meeting in Vegas, and indeed they are not long term friends, but simply people who for their own personal reasons have decided to stay in the hotel to gamble. The trio has adventures both gambling and womanizing in Vegas. One night, after a huge $500,000 baccarat and craps win, a depressed Jordan kills himself in his hotel room. Jordan's suicide was in spite of tying a dramatic winner take all $500,000 hand of baccarat, betting against the casino's owner, Alfred Gronevelt. After Jordan's death, Merlyn returns to his family in New York City and continues his life.  Cully Cross decides to stay in Las Vegas permanently, and through his prowess as a gambler and a hustler, he has caught the eye of Alfred Gronevelt, the Xanadu Hotel owner. Gronevelt eventually recruits Cully as a key employee, and as time goes on, he grooms Cully as his second in command, and Cully prospers running the casino, and acting as a casino host.\nIn New York, John Merlyn, who was an orphan and is now a government worker and moonlighting novel writer, struggles to make ends meet for his family. His father in law had helped him get the job as an administrative officer in a US Army Recruitment Center. One day, because he is near broke, Merlyn is persuaded by a crooked colleague at work to start taking bribery kick backs in return for getting the adult children of wealthy people out of the military draft by having them join the military reserve before their mailed draft notice is filed. Eventually, authorities find out about the draft scam, and Merlyn is put under grand jury investigation. Merlyn narrowly escapes any Federal charges by calling his old friend, the now mob connected casino manager Cully Cross in Las Vegas. Cross is able to use his political and business connections to get Merlyn off the legal hook. Soon thereafter, Merlyn is offered a job writing book reviews for a large magazine. There he meets a world-famous writer named Osano, and they become close friends. During this time, Merlyn has a successful novel published, and Hollywood studios bid on making the novel into a movie. The winning studio flies Merlyn to L.A to help with the novel's movie script, and to work with the movie producers. In California, Merlyn slowly falls in love with Janelle, a film actress. In the meantime, Merlyn becomes estranged from film production as he becomes aware of the subordination of writers to profit and studio drama that dominates in Hollywood.\nOne several years, most of the people Merlyn feels closest to die. His dear friend, Cully Cross had been involved in an elaborate money exchange scheme with a Japanese millionaire customer at the Hotel Xanadu he worked at. While in Japan, in a move ordered by Gronevelt, the Xanadu owner, Cully is murdered. Merlyn's brother, Artie, dies after a sudden heart attack. After many years of partying and carousing with Merlyn, and even sleeping with Merlyn's girlfriend Janelle, Osano finds he suffers from an incurable disease and decides to kill himself. As his business heir, Merlyn is surprised to find out that the manuscript Osano said he had been working on for more than ten years only consists of six completed pages (pages that are used as introduction to \"Fools Die\"). \nEventually, even Janelle also dies, from a brain aneurysm.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

Basler contends that much of Lincoln\u2019s life never happened as told by Vidal. This historical inaccuracy extends to the character\u2019s personalities and physical attributes.  Significantly, Vidal faced intense criticism for his depiction of a racist Lincoln, and a syphilitic deranged Mary Todd Lincoln. Despite the novel\u2019s genre of historical narrative, the purported distortion in facts was seen as potentially damaging to the public.John Alvis published a review of the novel in The Claremont Review of Books.  According to Alvis, the book is \u2018disappointing for being at bottom inadequate.\u2019  It was contended that Vidal\u2019s novel succumbed to melodrama, historical inaccuracy and sensationalism. The Dean of Lincoln Scholars Richard N. Current took great exception to his novel, starting a running feud with Vidal in the pages of The New York Review of Books.However, within academic quarters there was also positive reception. Harold Bloom, the Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, published a review in the New York Review of Books, where he called the book \u2018superb\u2019 and \u2018grand entertainment.\u2019 \nVidal was also described as an impressive writer who has helped shape popular consciousness and offer an alternative view on the dominant understanding of American society and history.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26271", "text": "Lincoln, a made-for-TV film based on the novel, first aired in 1988 in two parts on March 27 and March 28.

Miss Marple's nephew has paid for her to holiday there after a bout of ill health. She speaks with Major Palgrave, a well-travelled man with many stories to share. She sits, half listening, until Palgrave tells a story about a man who got away with murder more than once. When Palgrave asks her if she wants to see a picture of a murderer, she listens intently \u2013 but after he finds the snapshot in his wallet, he suddenly changes the subject. Miss Marple looks up to see why and spots several people nearby.\nThe next day, when the maid Victoria finds Major Palgrave dead in his room, Miss Marple is convinced he was murdered. She asks Dr Graham to find the photo he mentioned, pretending it is of her nephew, but it is not found. Meanwhile, she interviews the others: Tim and Molly Kendal, owners of the hotel; the Prescotts, a clergyman and his sister; Mr Jason Rafiel, a tycoon confined to a wheelchair; Jackson, his nurse/masseur/attendant/valet; Esther Walters, his secretary; the American Lucky Dyson and her husband, Greg; and Edward and Evelyn Hillingdon. On the beach, Miss Marple sees Se\u00f1ora de Caspearo, a woman on holiday who says she remembers Major Palgrave because he had an 'evil eye'. Miss Marple corrects her that he had a glass eye, but the Se\u00f1ora still says that it was evil.\nVictoria informs the Kendals that she did not remember seeing the high blood pressure medication, Serenite, in Major Palgrave's room before his death, although it was found on his table after his death. That night, Victoria is found stabbed to death. Molly begins having nightmares. Miss Marple finds Jackson looking at Molly's cosmetics; he says that if belladonna were added to one of them, it would cause nightmares. The following night, Tim finds Molly unconscious on the floor, apparently having taken an overdose of sleeping pills. The police are involved, and the cook, Enrico, tells them he saw Molly holding a steak knife before going outside. Miss Marple asks the others if Major Palgrave told people about the photo. Others claim Palgrave said it was not a photo of a wife killer but a husband killer. When police realize that the high blood pressure medicine did not belong to Major Palgrave, his body is exhumed and the autopsy reveals that he died by poison, as Miss Marple expected.\nAt night, Miss Marple is woken by the sounds of a search party. She is told that Tim woke up to find his wife missing. They find what seems to be her body in a creek, but it turns out to be Lucky; the two women resemble one another. \nMiss Marple abruptly realises who the major saw that night when he recognised the person in the snapshot as someone on the island. She wakes Mr Rafiel and Jackson, calling herself Nemesis, and they go to the Kendals' house. There they find Tim offering Molly a drink. Miss Marple tells Jackson to take the glass away. She says there is a deadly narcotic in it. While Jackson holds Tim down, She explains that Tim is the wife killer recognised by Major Palgrave. Miss Marple had thought Palgrave saw the Hillingdons and the Dysons over her right shoulder as they were coming up the beach, but had just realised that he had a glass eye on the left, so he could not have seen them. Tim and Molly were sitting on her left. Further, the story that the major told Miss Marple of the husband serially killing his wives and not getting caught was the story of Tim Kendal. Tim was planning to kill Molly soon, and so had to kill Major Palgrave when he recognised Tim. He also killed Victoria, who remembered the Serenite being in the wrong room. Tim put belladonna in Molly's cosmetics to make her appear mad to the others.

The projectile begins a fall onto the Earth from a distance of 260,000 kilometres (160,000 mi), and it is to strike the Earth at a speed of 185,400 km/h (115,200 mph), the same speed at which it left the mouth of the Columbiad.

Specifically, Milton reduces his use of simile and deploys a simpler syntax in Paradise Regained than he does in Paradise Lost, and this is consistent with Biblical descriptions of Jesus's plainness in his life and teachings (in the epic, he prefers Hebrew Psalms to Greek poetry). Modern editors believe the simpler style of Paradise Regained evinces Milton's poetic maturity. This is not to say that the poem bears no affinities with Milton's earlier work, but scholars continue to agree with Northrop Frye's suggestion that Paradise Regained is \"practically sui generis\" in its poetic execution.\nOne major concept emphasized throughout Paradise Regained is the idea of reversals. As implied by its title, Milton sets out to reverse the \"loss\" of Paradise. Thus, antonyms are often found next to each other, reinforcing the idea that everything that was lost in the first epic will be regained by the end of this \"brief epic\". Additionally, the work focuses on the idea of \"hunger\", both in a literal and in a spiritual sense. After wandering in the wilderness for forty days, Jesus is starving for food. Satan, too blind to see any non-literal meanings of the term, offers Christ food and various other temptations, but Jesus continually denies him. Although Milton's Jesus is remarkably human, an exclusive focus on this dimension of his character obscures the divine stakes of Jesus's confrontation with Satan; Jesus emerges victorious, and Satan falls, amazed.\nAn anecdote recounted by a Quaker named Thomas Ellwood provides some insight into Paradise Regained's development. After studying Latin with Milton and reading the poet's epic Paradise Lost, Ellwood remarked, \"Thou hast said much here of Paradise lost, but what hast thou to say of Paradise found?\" Hearing this, Milton at first \"sat some time in a muse\" before changing the subject; however, sometime thereafter he showed to Ellwood a new manuscript entitled Paradise Regained. Some maintain that although he seemed to express gratitude to Ellwood in a letter, Milton in truth \"passed on a friendly if impish fabrication\" that made Ellwood feel like the inspiration for the poem.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is his best known poem.  It imagines a tragic fate for Cressida in the medieval story of Troilus and Criseyde which was left untold in Geoffrey Chaucer's version. Henryson's cogent psychological drama, in which he consciously resists and confronts the routine depiction of Cressida (Cresseid) as simply 'false', is one of the features that has given the poem enduring interest for modern readers and it is one of the most admired works of northern renaissance literature.

After wandering for a while amongst the Greek soldiers, seeking their company, she returns to the home of her father Calchas, a keeper of the temple of Venus. Though Calchas welcomes her heartily, Cresseid desires to hide away from a disapproving world and encloses herself in a private oratory, where she weeps and rages against the cruelty of Venus and Cupid in, as she sees it, leading her on. The gods take offence at this blasphemy, and assemble to pass judgement on her, and the poem features graphically-realised portraits of the planetary pantheon of gods in the dream vision at its heart. They strike her with the symptoms of leprosy which remove her youth and good looks, leaving her disfigured and blind. She is thus considered a social outcast and decides she must join a leper colony. There she laments her fate until a fellow leper woman encourages her not to sigh over things which cannot be changed, but instead to take her cup and clapper and join the other lepers to beg for daily alms.\nAs Cresseid joins the lepers to go out begging, Troilus and the garrison of Troy happen to pass by. She lifts her eyes to his, but since she is blind she cannot recognise him. Troilus, similarly unable to recognise the disfigured Cresseid, yet being reminded of her, without quite knowing why, is spontaneously moved to give up to her all the wealth he has about him at that moment (his belt, a full purse of gold, and jewels) before riding off, almost fainting for grief when he reaches Troy. The lepers are astounded at the unexpected show of beneficence and when Cresseid asks of her benefactor's identity and is told, she, like Troilus, too is overcome with emotion. She berates herself for her treatment of him and renounces her previously 'selfish' complaints, before sitting down to write her testament, or will, dying soon after.\nHenryson's portrayal of Cresseid's 'disgrace' and ultimately tragic end, through the narrator of the poem, is observed with a largely rigorous objectivity. Where the narrator comes to judge, rather than reinforcing the institutional admonishment of a 'shocked' or disapproving society, he 'confesses' to his natural pity for Cresseid's misfortune, against the standard view of 'false womanhood' which she was taken in his day to represent.

Jack is not optimistic about the fight and does not adjust to life at the health farm; \"He didn't like being away from his wife and the kids and he was sore and grouchy most of the time,\" Doyle reports. Hogan and Doyle talk briefly about racehorses, and when they ask Jack whether he bets on them, Jack replies that he stopped because he lost money.\nJack asks Doyle what he thinks of the shape he is in. Doyle tries to stall, saying: \"Well, you can't tell ... You got a week to get around into form,\" but Jack asks for a straight answer. Doyle finally tells him, \"You're not right,\" at which point Jack confides that he has been unable to sleep, despite being tired, because he misses his wife. Hogan, seeing Jack's condition a few days later, tells Doyle that Jack has no chance against Walcott.

They go with Doyle to Jack's room and find him sleeping, but John wakes him up and asks Doyle to leave and tell Hogan the three visitors \"want to see him in about half an hour.\" Hogan tells Doyle that Steinfelt and Morgan are \"wise guys\" who own a pool-room, describing Steinfelt as a \"big operator\". Doyle and Hogan wait in the office, knowing the men do not want to be interrupted, until half an hour has elapsed. When they return to Jack's room, Steinfelt proposes having a drink.

When John suggests Jack have another drink, he refuses \u2013 saying \"I never liked to go to these wakes\". The visitors leave. Jack remains quiet through the rest of the day. Later that evening, he drinks heavily and suggests Doyle put money on Walcott, confiding that he himself has bet \"fifty grand\" on the opposing boxer.

Why not make money on it?\" Jack eventually passes out and Doyle puts him to bed.\nJack and Doyle make the journey to New York City the next morning, during which Jack is stingy with his money. After weighing in, Jack goes with Doyle to the hotel room the two are sharing; though Doyle's brother-in-law lives in the area, Jack wants to get his money's worth out of the double room and asks him to stay. The two play cribbage and, when John comes, they continue playing until Jack has won four and a half dollars. Before dinner, he says they should play another round to decide who will pay for dinner. The cribbage continues after dinner, with Jack winning another two and a half dollars, until the time comes to go to Madison Square Garden.\nEntering the ring at the Garden, Jack meets Walcott's cheerful words with cranky abruptness.

It is one about all of us, about Farida and Amin and our parents, and about Jamila. It is about how one story contains many and how they belong not to us but are part of the random currents of our time, and about how stories capture us and entangle us for all time.\n\nThe novel is narrated by Rashid in all but one of the ten chapters, which exception is drawn from the notebooks of his brother Amin. Rashid is the youngest child of teaching parents: he is two years younger than Amin, who is in turn two years younger than Farida, their sister. The children are brought up in Zanzibar late in 1950s, during a time of heady transition from colonialism to independence.\nRashid spins two tales: one is in part his own, and largely contingent on the other, set some fifty years thence on the outskirts of a small town in colonial Kenya, along the east African coast north of Mombasa, when early one morning in 1899 an Englishman stumbles out of the desert and collapses before a local shopkeeper outside his mosque.  The latter, Hassanali, takes him back home and, amidst the considerable kerfuffle, and with some help from family and local professionals, begins nursing the man back to health.\nHassanali is a nervous, superstitious, cowardly man. On first being approached by the almost lifeless Pearce, he mistakes him for a ghoulish genie come to spirit his soul away.\nBefore long, an English district officer, one Frederick Turner, arrives on the scene.  He accuses Hassanali of having stolen whatever goods the Englishman brought with him, and promptly conveys him back to the residency.  The traveller's name, as it turns out, is Martin Pearce, a man of liberal thought and broad linguistic knowledge, and something of an \"Orientalist\".  During his convalescence with Turner, he begins quickly to feel guilty about the harsh treatment and false accusations levelled at his original saviours, for he genuinely arrived with almost nothing but the clothes on his back: the only item he seems to have lost is his notebook.  On visiting the shopkeeper to apologise, he sees Rehana, Hassanali's sister, and falls for her immediately.\nRehana's father was an Indian trader who settled in Mombasa and married a local woman, but the family is now part of the \"Arabised minority\" in a town still fresh with the memory of its years of slavery under the sultan.\nThe subsequent relationship between Rehana and Pearce is, of course, a scandal.  Rashid in his narrative admits that it is difficult to say how it came about, if less so to figure out how it was discovered.  The upshot is that Rehana is forced to vacate the town and take up lodgings elsewhere with Pearce.\nHalf a century later, Amin, Rashid and Farida are growing up and receiving a typical colonial education in pre-independent Zanzibar.  Amin, like his parents, is to train to become a schoolteacher; Rashid is studying for Oxbridge; and Farida, an academic failure, becomes the family housekeep and small-business dressmaker to the young women of the town.  One of her clients is a beautiful woman named Jamila, granddaughter of Rehana and Pearce.  Despite her lowly repute \"as a divorced woman whose grandmother slept with mzungus  [sic]\", Amin falls in love with her, and she with him.  His parents are outraged on discovering the secret and refuse to brook it:\n\nDo you know who she is?  Do you know what kind of people they are?  Her grandmother was a chotara, a child of sin by an Indian man, a bastard.  When she grew into a woman, she was the mistress of an Englishman for many years, and before that another mzungu gave her a child of sin too, her own bastard.  That was her life, living dirty with European men [....  T]hey are a rich family so they don't care what anybody thinks.  They've always done as they wished.  This woman that you say you love, she is like her grandmother, living a life of secrets and sin.  She has been married and divorced already.  No one knows where she comes and where she goes, or who she goes to see.  They are not our kind of people.\nAmin is made to promise never to see her again, and he never really does.  He fears for the rest of his life that she thinks he has deserted her.\nIn the case of Rashid, meanwhile, it is his passionate book-learning that results in his desertion first of his home and eventually \"of the entire culture\": \"The place was stifling him, he said: the social obsequiousness, the medieval religiosity, the historical mendacities.\"After independence and the subsequent revolution, life for all the characters is altered completely.  Rashid misses the socio-political turmoil back home in his isolation as a university student in England; in fact, he never sees his ailing, tragic family again.  Although he keeps up a steady stream of correspondence, this becomes increasingly strained with the preterition of time and the need for caution engendered of a brutal and dictatorial government.  His only knowledge of the situation is gleaned from the letters and a few allusive snippets of news.\nBoth Ma and Amin lose their sight, and the former's death is celebrated as having put her out of her mounting misery.

Later as bishop he invited his priests to share a community life with him.Augustine followed the monastic or religious life as it was known to his contemporaries, drafting rules for the monks and nuns of Roman Africa. Like St. Basil, Augustine's view diverged from that of the earlier eremitical approach of strict physical austerities. In The Ways of the Catholic Church, Augustine observed contemporary criticisms of the methods of the Eastern hermits in the Egyptian desert. It was said that their extreme isolation and excessive asceticism \"were no longer productive\" for the church or society. In response to this, \"Augustine promoted poverty of spirit and continence of the heart while living in the milieu of a town such as Hippo.\"In Hippo, the members of his monastic house lived in community while yet keeping to their pastoral obligations. For Augustine, 'the love of neighbour was simply another expression of the love of God.\" He saw the call to service in the church a necessitas (necessity) to be heeded, even if it compromised a personal desire for contemplation and study. One of the elements of communal living was simplicity of lifestyle. Regarding the use of property or possessions, Augustine did not make a virtue of poverty, but of sharing. Augustine wrote frequently on prayer, but prescribed no specific method, system, or posture; although he highly endorsed the psalms.\nSeveral of his friends and disciples elevated to the episcopacy imitated his example, among them Alypius at Tagaste, Possidius at Calama, Profuturus and Fortunatus at Cirta, Evodius at Uzalis, and Boniface at Carthage.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26317", "text": "The title, Rule of Saint Augustine, has been applied to each of the following documents:\n\nLetter 211 addressed to a community of women;\nSermons 355 and 356 entitled \"De vit\u00e2 et moribus clericorum suorum\";\na portion of the rule drawn up for clerks or Consortia monachorum;\na rule known as Regula secunda; and\nanother rule called: \"De vit\u00e2 eremitic\u00e2 ad sororem liber\".The last is a treatise on eremitical life by Saint \u00c6lred, Abbot of Rievaulx, England, who died in 1166.

His Letter 211 was read and re-read by Saint Benedict, who borrowed several important texts from it for insertion in his own rule. Saint Benedict's chapter on the labour of monks is inspired by the treatise De opere monachorum. The teaching concerning religious poverty is formulated in the sermons \"De vit\u00e2 et moribus clericorum suorum\".\nThe influence of Augustine, however, was nowhere stronger than in southern Gaul in the fifth and sixth centuries. L\u00e9rins and the monks of that school were familiar with Augustine's monastic writings, which, together with those of Cassianus, were the mine from which the principal elements of their rules were drawn. Saint Caesarius, Archbishop of Arles, the great organiser of religious life in that section chose some of the most interesting articles of his rule for monks from St. Augustine, and in his rule for nuns quoted at length from Letter 211. Saints Augustine and Caesarius were animated by the same spirit which passed from the Archbishop of Arles to Saint Aurelian, one of his successors, and, like him, a monastic Iawgiver. Augustine's influence also extended to women's monasteries in Gaul, where the Rule of Caesarius was adopted either wholly or in part, as, for example, at Sainte-Croix of Poitiers, Juxamontier of Besan\u00e7on, and Chamali\u00e8res near Clermont.\nBut it was not always enough merely to adopt the teachings of Augustine and to quote him; the author of the regula Tarnatensis (an unknown monastery in the Rhone valley) introduced into his work the entire text of the letter addressed to the nuns, having previously adapted it to a community of men by making slight modifications. This adaptation was surely made in other monasteries in the sixth or seventh centuries, and in his \"Codex regularum\" Saint Benedict of Aniane published a text similarly modified.\nFor want of exact information we cannot say in which monasteries this was done, and whether they were numerous. Letter 211, which has thus become the Rule of Saint Augustine, certainly constituted a part of the collections known under the general name of \"Rules of the Fathers\" and used by the founders of monasteries as a basis for the practices of the religious life. It does not seem to have been adopted by the regular communities of canons or of clerks which began to be organised in the eighth and ninth centuries. The rule given them by Saint Chrodegang, Bishop of Metz (742-766), is almost entirely drawn from that of Saint Benedict, and no more decided traces of Augustinian influence are to be found in it than in the decisions of the Synods of Aachen (816\u2013819), which may be considered the real constitutions of the canons Regular. For this influence we must await the foundation of the clerical or canonical communities established in the eleventh century for the effective counteracting of simony and clerical concubinage.\nThe religious life of the Bishop of Hippo was, for a long time, a matter of dispute between the Canons Regular and the Hermits of St. Augustine, each of these two families claiming him exclusively as its own. It was not so much the establishing of an historical fact as the settling of a claim of precedence that caused the trouble, and as both sides could not in the right, the quarrel would have continued indefinitely had not the Pope Sixtus IV put an end by his Bull \"Summum Silentium\" (1484).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26319", "text": "By the eleventh century, various monks felt that the Rule of Saint Benedict (which had been the standard model for monastic life for the last five centuries) no longer satisfied the demands of a rapidly changing society, with its increasing urbanisation, growing literacy, and shifts in distribution of wealth and power. While in some cases this resulted in reforms aimed at restoring observance of the Benedictine Rule to its original purity, trimming away later additions, there also developed groups of clerics (or 'canons') living in community in a more rigorously ascetic lifestyle than that followed by the Rule of Saint Benedict, following the set of ancient texts known as the 'Rule of Saint Augustine'. These clerics were widely known as Canons Regular (in order to distinguish them from the traditional 'secular' canons who followed the older, Carolingian 'rule of Aachen'.), 'Augustinian canons', 'canons of St Augustine', 'Austin canons' or 'Black canons',  Observance of this rule was approved for members of the clergy by the Council of Lateran (1059) and another council held at Rome four years later.\nAdoption of the Rule of St Augustine subsequently spread rapidly through Western Europe. The early Victorine Canons embraced the Rule of St Augustine in 1113. In the year 1120, Norbert of Xanten chose the Rule of St Augustine as he founded the Premonstratensian Order. It was adopted by John of Matha in 1198 in founding the Trinitarian Order. At the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) it was accepted as one of the approved rules of the church.

Juliana asks Moncada to use his influence to gain release of her father, Don de Romeu. He conditions his effort on her marrying him. She agrees, but Moncada is unable to secure a release, and de Romeu is executed for treason. Moncada offers protection to Juliana, hoping that she will either marry him or become his mistress. She demands that he compensate her for the loss of her father. He attacks Juliana but Diego and Isabel intervene and subdue him.  \nThe girls and Diego decide to leave the city and head for the Americas. After months of traveling on foot, dressed as religious pilgrims, they reach the port and board a ship captained by Diego's old friend, Santiago de Le\u00f3n. When the ship reaches Cuba, it is attacked by a pirate crew led by Jean Lafitte. Diego and the girls are taken hostage. Lafitte takes them to his base in southern Louisiana, where they await a ransom from Alejandro de la Vega. Juliana becomes smitten with Lafitte, until she learns that he is married, to a free woman of color named Catherine.\nDiego begins gambling in New Orleans in an attempt to win enough money to buy their freedom. The girls use jewels they obtained before leaving Spain to buy their freedom. Lafitte returns the jewels to Juliana, an indication of his love for her. Catherine's mother tells Juliana that before Catherine died in childbirth with Pierre, she had chosen Juliana to marry Lafitte and raise their son. Juliana agrees to marry Lafitte, and Diego and Isabel are freed.\nDiego returns to California with Isabel and her chaperone, to find his father in prison and his lands confiscated by his arch-enemy, Moncada. Diego frees his father from prison, and puts him in the care of the natives and his wife Regina to convalesce. Diego is captured and arrested, but freed by two Zorro figures.

In the present day, construction workers find this bunker, and the Twelve, as they become known, are revived. Put into the care of the U.S. military, they are housed together in a mansion where they receive counseling and support, are gradually made to understand that decades have passed, and are offered a role as heroes in the 21st century.\nThe Twelve adjust in various ways: The Blue Blade becomes a celebrity; the Phantom Reporter starts a column for the Daily Bugle, Dynamic Man allies himself with the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies and throws himself into heroics; the Black Widow reconnects as the \"instrument of vengeance\" of an unknown party and begins going on missions; and Rockman bemoans being cut off from an underground kingdom that may or may not exist. On ballistics evidence, police arrest the Laughing Mask for a 1940s murder. In addition, the daughter of the creator of the robot Electro reclaims possession of the robot.\nIn the framing story (set \"much later\"), the Phantom Reporter, gun in hand, stands over the body of the Blue Blade, regretting the man's death and vowing to find the killer.\nThe Phantom Reporter is ultimately able to reveal the killer, in a classic mystery setup that involves rounding up the rest of the cast from their various pursuits and explaining the events step by step. The recent spate of unexplained crimes, including an attack on a gay bar Dynamic Man had visited, was carried out by Electro under the control of Dynamic Man, who is forced to admit he also is an artificial being. Blue Blade, after hooking himself up to Electro's control apparatus, discovered this, and so Dynamic Man had Electro attack and kill him. Phantom Reporter has the Fiery Mask burn off Dynamic Man's costume, revealing him to be a \"man\" who will never be anatomically correct. It is inferred that his creator's phobias about sexual purity were transferred to Dynamic Man, thus explaining his discomfort with interracial marriages and the homophobia he has displayed throughout the series. He attacks the mansion, trying to trap and kill the others, but all manage to escape due to a sacrifice by Rockman.\nAfter fleeing to his creator's home and laboratory, he is confronted by Phantom Reporter along with Captain Wonder, Mastermind Excello, and Fiery Mask. Dynamic Man kills Fiery Mask by crushing his larynx, but FM manages to pass his powers along to the Phantom Reporter. Dynamic Man is destroyed by the Reporter, while Captain Wonder holds him in place, suffering horrible burns. Later, at a funeral for Fiery Mask, the others discuss their future plans. Mister E plans on retiring to spend time with his family, to make up for his previous rejection of his Jewish identity.

In the beginning there is a profusion of intimate feelings, which is followed by tears and lamentations. Finally, there is a time when one feels that everything he does is futile. At this moment, how can he not be enlightened?\nThe opening chapter of the novel describes a great stone archway and on either side a couplet is inscribed:\n\nThis couplet is later reiterated, however this time as:\n\nAs one critic points out, the couplet signifies \"not a hard and fast division between truth and falsity, reality and illusion, but the impossibility of making such distinctions in any world, fictional or actual.\" It also symbolizes the peculiar Taoist religious tradition prevalent in Northern China since the Yuan dynasty as practiced in Cao's time, as well as Taoism's alternate roles in society such as doctrines for philosophical and intellectual rather than religious guidance and one of the schools of thought Buddhist sects in China syncretized with their own. This theme is further reflected in the name of the main family, Jia (\u8cc8, pronounced ji\u01ce), which is a homophone with the character ji\u01ce \u5047, meaning false or fictitious; this is mirrored the surname of the other main family, Zhen (\u7504, pronounced zh\u0113n), a homophone for the word \"real\" (\u771f). It is suggested that the novel is both a realistic reflection and a fictional or \"dream\" version of Cao's own family.\nEarly Chinese critics identified its two major themes as those of the nature of love, and of the transitoriness of earthly material values, as outlined in Buddhist and Taoist philosophies. \nLater scholars echoed the philosophical aspects of love and its transcendent power as depicted in the novel. One remarked that the novel is a remarkable example of the \"dialectic of dream and reality, art and life, passion and enlightenment, nostalgia and knowledge.\"The novel also vividly depicts Chinese material culture, such as medicine, cuisine, tea culture, festivities, proverbs, mythology, Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, filial piety, opera, music, architecture, funeral rites, painting, classic literature and the Four Books.  Among these, the novel is particularly notable for its grand use of poetry.Since the establishment of Cao Xueqin as the novel's author, its autobiographical aspects have come to the fore. Cao Xueqin's clan was similarly raided in real life, and suffered a steep decline. Marxist interpretation starting in the New Culture Movement saw the novel as exposing feudal society's corruption and emphasized the clashes between the classes. Since the 1980s, critics have embraced the novel's richness and aesthetics in a more multicultural context.In the title H\u00f3ng l\u00f3u M\u00e8ng (\u7d05\u6a13\u5922, literally \"Red Chamber Dream\"), \"red chamber\" can refer to the sheltered chambers where the daughters of a prominent family reside. It also refers to Baoyu's dream in chapter five, set in a \"red chamber\", a dream where the fates of many of the characters are foreshadowed. \"Mansion\" is one of the definitions of the Chinese character \"\u6a13\" (l\u00f3u), but the scholar Zhou Ruchang writes that in the phrase h\u00f3ngl\u00f3u it is more accurately translated as \"chamber\".The novel's mythological elements were also inspired by the services Cao was involved in at the Dongyue Temple. The temple's most venerated gods came from Daoism, Chinese Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism and shamanic traditions from various regions within and outside of China, and the book's spiritual themes, prose stylization, and portrayals of mythical figures were inspired by the traditional stories told about these deities and other oral temple traditions from Beijing. Much of this folklore was already popular during the Yuan dynasty and was retold in various ways in Cao's era in the Qing dynasty.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It made much play of contrasts between British/American poetry, old and then contemporary poetry, and for example Brits like Philip Larkin versus Ted Hughes.\nThe criteria for inclusion in The New Poetry were these: the poets had to be British (which excluded Sylvia Plath from the first edition); they needed to have been young enough to have made their reputations only after 1950 (this excluded the likes of W. H. Auden and Louis MacNeice); and they had to appeal to Alvarez himself. There were two exceptions to the first and second of these guidelines: Alvarez included long well-established Americans Robert Lowell and John Berryman at the start of the anthology. Alvarez concluded that Lowell and Berryman were the most influential figures on British poetry writing at that time, which justified their inclusion. Each poet was represented with a minimum of five poems. In the revised edition (1966) Alvarez relaxed these rules somewhat to allow Plath and yet another American poet, Anne Sexton, to be represented.

It was anthologized in 1949's 55 Short Stories from the New Yorker, as well as in Salinger's 1953 collection Nine Stories. The story is an enigmatic examination of a young married couple, Muriel and Seymour Glass, on vacation in Florida. It is the first of his stories to feature a member of the fictional Glass family.\nWhen the 28-year-old Salinger submitted the manuscript to The New Yorker in January 1947, titled \"The Bananafish\", its arresting dialogue and precise style were read with interest by fiction editor William Maxwell and his staff, though the point of the story, in this original version, was considered incomprehensible.At Maxwell's urging, Salinger embarked upon a major reworking of the piece, adding the opening section with Muriel's character, and crafting the material to provide insights into Seymour's tragic demise. In frequent consultation with editor Gus Lobrano, Salinger revised the story numerous times throughout 1947, renaming it \"A Fine Day for Bananafish\". The New Yorker published the final version as \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" one year after Salinger first submitted the manuscript.The story met with immediate acclaim, and according to Salinger biographer Paul Alexander, was \"the story that would permanently change his standing in the literary community.\" Salinger's decision to collaborate with Maxwell and The New Yorker staff in developing the story marked a major advance in his career and led to his entry into the echelon of elite writers at the journal.

Muriel Glass, a wealthy and self-absorbed woman, phones her mother from her suite to discuss her husband Seymour, a World War II combat veteran recently discharged from an army hospital; it is implied that he was being evaluated for a psychiatric disorder. Muriel's mother is concerned by reports of her son-in-law's increasingly bizarre and anti-social actions, and warns her daughter that he may \"lose control of himself\". Muriel dismisses her remarks as hyperbole, regarding her husband's idiosyncrasies as benign and manageable. \nMeanwhile, at the resort's adjoining beach, a child named Sybil Carpenter has been left unsupervised by her mother so that she may drink at the hotel bar. Sybil wanders on the beach and finds Seymour, lying in solitude a quarter-mile from the hotel. Sybil reproaches Seymour for allowing another little girl, Sharon Lipschutz, to sit with him the previous night as he played the lounge piano for the hotel's guests. Seymour attempts to placate Sybil by suggesting they \"catch a Bananafish\", but Sybil insists that Seymour choose between her and Sharon Lipschutz. Seymour responds that he observed Sybil abusing a hotel patron's dog, and the girl falls silent.\nSeymour places Sybil on a rubber raft and wades into the water, where he tells her the story of \"the very tragic life\" of the bananafish: they gorge themselves on bananas, become too large to escape their feeding holes, and die. Sybil is unfazed by the story, and claims that she sees a bananafish with six bananas in its mouth. Seymour affectionately kisses the arch of one of her feet, and returns her to shore, where she departs.\nOnce alone, and returning to the hotel, Seymour becomes less affable.

Originally, the story consisted merely of Seymour's incident on the beach with Sybil Carpenter and the subsequent suicide. Maxwell argued that there was no clear explanation for Seymour's killing himself. After meeting with Maxwell, Salinger incorporated the portion of the story with Muriel talking to her mother on the phone. After the triumph of \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\", Salinger allowed the New Yorker to have the first chance at printing all his subsequent writing by signing a contract with the magazine.Despite some differing critical opinion, Salinger's Nine Stories, in which \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" appears, are not separate entities published together. Author Eberhard Alsen, in A Reader\u2019s Guide to J.D Salinger, observes that the stories evolve chronologically. They change in a way that mirrors Salinger's personal life and his experiences with religion. Many scholars and critics have analyzed and reviewed the character of Seymour Glass in regard to his wartime experiences and suicide. Salinger's daughter, Margaret Salinger, recalls her father's stories from World War II and makes a connection between Salinger and Seymour. Author Ron Rosenbaum draws from Margaret Salinger's memories to elicit a connection between Salinger's progression from bleak to optimistic, and the spiritual writing style in Nine Stories.Salinger was also greatly influenced by Ernest Hemingway's writing style and narration method.

After sending the initial draft, \"The Bananafish\", to the New Yorker, Harold Ober, Salinger's agent, received a letter from William Maxwell, a fiction editor at the magazine. The letter, from January 22, 1947, stated: \"We like parts of 'The Bananafish' by J.D. Salinger very much, but it seems to us to lack any discernible story or point. If Mr. Salinger is around town, perhaps he'd like to come in and talk to us about New Yorker stories.\"When \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" was first published, its initial reception was favorable. Readers accepted Salinger's novel tone, and \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" popularized Salinger in the literary community.Much of the criticism of the story involves the character of Seymour Glass, who appears in several other Salinger stories. Critics interpret evidence from the story to determine the cause of Seymour's suicide; conflicting reasons appear in other stories about the Glass family. Some believe the entire world drives Seymour to madness; others draw a connection to post-traumatic stress. According to critic Janet Malcolm, the world portrayed in the story is both tangled and simplified by Salinger.

When Rick returns with his group, Carl shows him writing scratched into the woodwork of a windowsill outside the church: \"you'll burn for this\".\nThe group celebrates that night with a feast. Rick announces that he has decided to follow Abraham's proposal to head to Washington, D.C. to deliver Eugene there to help work a cure for the outbreak. Afterwards, Tara confesses to Maggie about her affiliation with the Governor and the prison attack, for which Maggie forgives her. Meanwhile, Gabriel sneaks off to be alone in his office, sadly looking at a photo of himself with the woman that became the walker from the food bank. Carol, who is still coming to terms with being exiled and the events of The Grove, leaves and goes to the car she found earlier. Daryl follows her and asks what she is doing. She replies she doesn't know, and Daryl asks her to come back with him. Just then they see a car race by with a white cross in its back windshield, which Daryl recognizes as the car that took Beth. The two get in the car and set off to follow without telling the others.\nAs the feast dies down, Bob steps outside the church, weeping. He is knocked out by a hooded figure, and when he wakes, finds himself watched by Gareth, Martin, and four other Terminus members, all seeking revenge toward Rick's group as their actions forced them to abandon Terminus and wander.

She has no great beauty (olive skin, dark hair and dark eyes in a time when pale-faced blonds were seen as the coveted image), no wealth and no title. She meets up with her older sister Mary, who is a lady-in-waiting in Queen Catherine of Aragon's court, and is rumoured to be the mistress of King Henry VIII of England. The King is tiring of Catherine because she has produced no sons - only a daughter, Mary.\nAnne's somewhat difficult childhood before the event is outlined. Always ill-favored by her parents, constantly antagonized by her older sister Mary, and disgusted by her own \"deformities\" (a small sixth finger and mole on her neck) she develops an ambition to rise to the top.\nAnne, jealous of her sister's rumoured affair when Mary flaunts the fact that she has the King's favor, vows to become the second wife of King Henry VIII. Anne, too, becomes a lady-in-waiting in the Queen's court. When the King tires of Mary, Anne uses her wits to gain the King's heart. While strategically courting the King, Anne manages to persuade Henry to seek an annulment for his marriage to Catherine. When the Pope refuses, he defies the Roman Catholic Church, declares his marriage null and void on his own authority, and marries Anne. Everybody at court hates her, claiming that she is a witch - as her sixth finger and the mole on her neck seem to indicate. \nTriumphant, Anne gets her way and becomes the wife of Henry and Queen of England. They have a child together, but it is a daughter, Elizabeth, and thus a great disappointment to Henry. The inability to produce a male heir continues to trouble Henry, and places Anne in a dangerous position.\nMeanwhile, Anne's sister Mary is now widowed after her husband dies of the sweating sickness and remarries a commoner in secret. On learning that she is pregnant, she reveals this to Anne, who banishes her from court. The two never reconcile.\nWhen Anne fails to give Henry a son after three years of marriage, the Seymour family begins plotting. Jane Seymour catches the king's attention. Realizing that the king may toss Anne aside for her, Anne begins to panic. Like Anne earlier in the novel, Jane refuses to become the King's mistress and instead drops heavy hints of marriage. After Anne miscarries again, she is falsely accused by the King, and by his daughter Mary, and by Lady Rochford, the wife of Anne's brother George, of committing adultery with five other men, her own brother George among them. Anne is sent to the Tower of London as a prisoner, and executed there for her treason against the King.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26486", "text": "In this novel the birthdates of the Boleyn children are 1502 (Mary), 1507 (Anne), and 1509 (George). Historians now believe the years of birth to be 1499 for Mary, 1504 for George, and either 1501 or 1507 for Anne.\nIn the novel, Mary becomes the king's mistress around 1520, sometime prior to the \"Field of the Cloth of Gold\". She is also presented as being married after the affair begins. In reality, Mary was married in February 1520, and embarked on her affair around 1521/1522. There is no evidence of her ever being sexually active with Henry VIII before her marriage to William Carey.\nThe book presents Anne as having \"deformities\" (sixth finger, mole on her neck). These \"defects\" were not ever mentioned by anyone who knew her throughout her lifetime. The first report of Anne Boleyn having any kind of deformity was brought up by Nicholas Sanders, long after her death. Sanders never met or saw her, being a young child when she died. His claim that Anne had the extra finger and mole was certainly just a false claim designed to slander her after her death.\nThe novel displays Mary as being a great beauty, the family favorite. This is untrue. Mary was sent to France in 1514. During her stay, she became known for her promiscuity. She had a number of affairs with King Francis and his courtiers. The French king himself referred to her as \"a great prostitute, infamous above all,\" \"the English mare,\" and \"my hackney.\" Mary was sent away from the French court in 1519 for her promiscuous behavior, in disgrace. (Said affairs go unmentioned in the novel.) Her family was horrified. Thomas Boleyn managed to marry her off to a minor courtier a year later. There is no evidence that Mary was extraordinarily beautiful since there are no contemporary descriptions or paintings of her. In fact, there are descriptions of Anne Boleyn as a great beauty with captivating eyes.\nAnne's parents would not have considered sending her to a nunnery because of her \"defects\"; as mentioned before, she had none. When she was sent abroad, it was for special education. The position Anne's parents secured for her in the Netherlands and France were greatly sought after.\nMary did marry a commoner in 1534. Her family was furious, and the king had her banished from court. Mary's statement \"I would rather beg my bread with him than be the finest queen ever christened\", was not something she told her sister. It was written in a letter to Thomas Cromwell. When Mary was having financial trouble, Anne assisted her by sending a golden cup and some money. These actions are never mentioned in the book.\nSome time in November 1532, Anne and Henry were married in Calais. Anne did not sleep with Henry before she was wed. They were later remarried on English soil on January 25 when she was found to be pregnant.\nHistorically, Anne was an affectionate mother to Elizabeth, while in the novel, she simply wants a son to please Henry and hardly ever sees her daughter.\nThe book depicts Henry's daughter Mary by Catherine of Aragon as having been summoned to Greenwich Palace to witness the birth of Elizabeth because tradition requires it. She is then subsequently forced to perform several tedious and indignant tasks for Anne, which is merely \"a means of passing the time.\" However, none of this happened in reality because Mary Tudor was living at Richmond at the time.\nAnne did not seduce the king into marrying her. When she attracted the king it was unintentional. She was not jealous of her sister's affair. In fact, she was rather horrified by Mary's actions.\nAt the end, while Anne is awaiting execution, she narrates that while Catherine of Aragon had many supporters during her time of trouble, she had none. Actually, she did have friends at court, among them Thomas Wyatt, Margaret Wyatt, Francis Weston, and others. She was supported by other leading Reformers, including Martin Luther and Marguerite of France. While Anne was largely unpopular with the English common folk during most of her reign, the sympathy of the people shifted to her when the accusations were formed as they were so outrageous that even her enemy Eustace Chapuys was incredulous.\nAnne's charity works also goes unmentioned. Anne donated what is equivalent to millions of dollars to the poor people, more than all of Henry VIII's other wives combined.The novel depicts Anne's accused lovers as being hung, drawn and quartered. In reality, they were all spared the traitor's death, instead receiving the simple axe. On page 129, Anne says that she, herself, will rest her own head on the block the following morning.

Even though the conditions of this neighbourhood leave much to be desired, the children's play is infused with their almost magical way of perceiving the world, which the narrator dutifully conveys to the reader:\n\nOur shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness.\nBut though these boys \"career\" around the neighbourhood in a very childlike way, they are also aware of and interested in the adult world, as represented by their spying on the narrator's uncle as he comes home from work and, more importantly, on Mangan's sister, whose dress \"swung as she moved\" and whose \"soft rope of hair tossed from side to side\". These boys are on the brink of sexual awareness and, awed by the mystery of another sex, are hungry for knowledge.\nOn one rainy evening, the boy secludes himself in a soundless, dark drawing-room and gives his feelings for her full release: \"I pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: O love! O love! many times.\" This scene is the culmination of the narrator's increasingly romantic idealization of Mangan's sister. By the time he actually speaks to her, he has built up such an unrealistic idea of her that he can barely put sentences together: \"When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me if I was going to Araby. I forget whether I answered yes or no.\" But the narrator recovers splendidly: when Mangan's sister dolefully states that she will not be able to go to Araby, he gallantly offers to bring something back for her.\nThe narrator now cannot wait to go to the Araby bazaar and procure for his beloved some grand gift that will endear him to her. And though his aunt frets, hoping that it is not \"some Freemason affair\", and though his uncle, perhaps intoxicated, perhaps stingy, arrives so late from work and equivocates so much that he almost keeps the narrator from being able to go, the intrepid yet frustrated narrator heads out of the house, tightly clenching a florin, in spite of the late hour, toward the bazaar.\nBut the Araby market turns out not to be the fantastic place he had hoped it would be. It is late; most of the stalls are closed. The only sound is \"the fall of the coins\" as men count their money. Worst of all, however, is the vision of sexuality\u2014of his future\u2014that he receives when he stops at one of the few remaining open stalls. The young woman minding the stall is engaged in a conversation with two young men. Though he is potentially a customer, she only grudgingly and briefly waits on him before returning to her frivolous conversation.

Scrooge feels that he should wear a coat of gold and provides gold bars. However, his tailor warns that the coat would be crinkly, as it would be the same as converting bauxite to tinfoil. The tailor says there is no feasible way to make a gold coat unless somehow the Golden Fleece exists. Scrooge decides to give up, realizing that not even his money can buy everything, until he meets a man called Ali Eikral who is from the country of Seikral. Donald Duck, who has never heard of Seikral, is suspicious of the Eikral's intentions, so he asks his grandnephews to look up the name Seikral in the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook. It mentions Jason and the Argonauts. The nephews figure out that \"Seikral\" is \"Larkies\" spelled backwards and Larkies are creatures who are half women, half birds and that the true name of their country is Colchis, where Medea fled when her relationship with Jason failed, taking the Golden Fleece with her and putting it a labyrinth of halls to be guarded by a \"Sleepless Dragon\".\nDonald and the nephews are about to warn Scrooge that he is walking into a trap set by Larkies. Donald is also suspicious, and warns Scrooge as well when Scrooge is aboard a boat paying the disguised man five gold bars for his passage to Colchis. Just then, the \"Eikrals\" throw the gold bars overboard and reveal themselves as Larkies, capturing both Scrooge and Donald as Huey, Dewey, and Louie come to the rescue too late. However, the nephews see the Larkies' discarded gold bars in shallow water, then retrieve them to plan a rescue mission by buying their own weapons and hiring the services of a helicopter pilot to fly them to Colchis. The reason for the Larkies' kidnapping was that their queen has died, and they were on a mission to abduct the world's richest man (believing he is also the best gourmand) to judge in their cooking contest, the winner of which will become the new queen. One of the Larkies named Agnes agrees to help Scrooge and Donald escape if Scrooge says that her recipe is the best. To Scrooge's chagrin, it happened to be parsnip pudding, and Scrooge hates parsnips more than any other food. Later, while her sisters are sulking, the new queen Agnes lets Scrooge and Donald go but regrets it, so she later tricks them into yelling the word \"Seikral\" to find the way into the labyrinth. However, the maze of halls has a unique effect that will reverse the sound, so \"Larkies\" is shouted back. The Larkies find out that they escaped and bombard them near to the point of submission. However, the nephews arrive and drive away the Larkies with traps such as mice.\nEventually, Scrooge and Donald reunite with the nephews and they find the Golden Fleece and defeat the Sleepless Dragon by covering its eyes with the Golden Fleece then sing a lullaby. Scrooge rejoices that he will now have the world's most fashionable coat, gold cloth with diamond buttons. One month later, they are back in Duckburg where the tailor has now finished Scrooge's coat.

It floated down next to her and touched itself against her forehead for a second and they then both fell to the ground.\nWhile recovering, a small crowd gathers around her. A policeman shows up, the crowd increases in size, and an FBI agent arrives. The girl sits up and says that the saucer spoke to her. The FBI man orders her to shut up and takes both the girl and the now-inanimate saucer into custody. The authorities obtain no information from the saucer or from the girl. They interrogate her about everything but especially about what the saucer had said to her. She refuses to answer, as the saucer was talking only to her, and thinks that it's nobody else's business. Finally, after many months in custody, including jail, she is released.\nEven though she is plain and awkward, men ask her out on dates, but only in order to find out what the saucer said to her. Every now and then reporters track her down to ask about the saucer. Finally, she resorted to taking a job as a night cleaner so that no one else will see her. In her loneliness and isolation, she takes to throwing messages in bottles into the ocean. The authorities try to collect all the bottles but eventually give up when they find the same message in each bottle. The message in the bottles is a poem about loneliness.\nThe man then explains that he found one of her bottles two years ago and has been looking for her ever since.

He scored heavily against the ageing World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz in tournaments (+3\u22120=1) but refused an opportunity to challenge Steinitz for the world title in 1892 because of the demands of his medical practice.\n\nSoon afterwards, in St. Petersburg in 1893, Tarrasch drew a hard-fought match against Steinitz' challenger Mikhail Chigorin (+9\u22129=4) after leading most of the way. He also won four major tournaments in succession: Breslau 1889, Manchester 1890, Dresden 1892, and Leipzig 1894.\nHowever, after Emanuel Lasker became world chess champion in 1894, Tarrasch could not match him. Fred Reinfeld wrote: \"Tarrasch was destined to play second fiddle for the rest of his life.\"  For example, Lasker scored much better against mutual opponents, e.g. vs. Chigorin, Tarrasch had +2 over 34 games while Lasker scored +7 in 21; vs. Akiba Rubinstein, Tarrasch was \u22128 without a single win, while Lasker scored +2\u22121=2; vs. David Janowski, Tarrasch scored +3 compared to Lasker's huge +22; vs. G\u00e9za Mar\u00f3czy, Tarrasch was +1 over 16 games while Lasker scored +4\u22120=1, vs. Richard Teichmann Tarrasch scored +8\u22125=2, while Lasker beat him all four tournament games.  However, Tarrasch had a narrow plus score against Harry Nelson Pillsbury of +6\u22125=2, while Lasker was even +5\u22125=4.  Still, Tarrasch remained a powerful player, demolishing Frank Marshall in a match in 1905 (+8\u22121=8), and winning Ostend 1907 over Schlechter, Janowski, Marshall, Burn, and Chigorin.\nThere was no love lost between Tarrasch and Lasker.

Revizor, literally: \"Inspector\"), is a satirical play by Russian dramatist and novelist, Nikolai Gogol. Originally published in 1836, the play was revised for an 1842 edition. Based upon an anecdote allegedly recounted to Gogol by Pushkin, the play is a comedy of errors, satirizing human greed, stupidity, and the political corruption of contemporary Russia.\nThe dream-like scenes of the play, often mirroring each other, whirl in the endless vertigo of self-deception around the main character, Khlestakov (rendered in some English translations as Hlestakov), who personifies irresponsibility, light-mindedness, and absence of measure. \"He is full of meaningless movement and meaningless fermentation incarnate, on a foundation of placidly ambitious inferiority\" (D. S. Mirsky). The publication of the play led to a great outcry in the reactionary press. It took the personal intervention of Tsar Nicholas I to have the play staged, with Mikhail Shchepkin taking the role of the Mayor. Nicholas I was personally present at the play's premiere on the stage of the Alexandrinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on April 19, 1836, concluding that \"there is nothing sinister in the comedy, as it is only a cheerful mockery of bad provincial officials.\"According to D. S. Mirsky, The Government Inspector \"is not only supreme in character and dialogue \u2013 it is one of the few Russian plays constructed with unerring art from beginning to end. The great originality of its plan consisted in the absence of all love interest and of sympathetic characters. The latter feature was deeply resented by Gogol's enemies, and as a satire the play gained immensely from it.

Moreover, his original travel destination was Saratov Governorate, but for some unknown reason he has been staying in this town for a long time. Therefore, the Mayor and his crooked cronies are immediately certain that this upper-class twit is the dreaded inspector. For quite some time, however, Khlestakov does not even realize that he has been mistaken for someone else.

{"id": "50_273", "question": "Who is the author of The Feast of the Goat?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_26558", "text": "The Feast of the Goat (Spanish: La Fiesta del Chivo) is a 2000 novel by the Peruvian Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Mario Vargas Llosa. The book is set in the Dominican Republic and portrays the assassination of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, and its aftermath, from two distinct standpoints a generation apart: during and immediately after the assassination itself, in May 1961; and thirty-five years later, in 1996. Throughout, there is also extensive reflection on the heyday of the dictatorship, in the 1950s, and its significance for the island and its inhabitants.\nThe novel follows three interwoven storylines.  The first concerns a woman, Urania Cabral, who is back in the Dominican Republic, after a long absence, to visit her ailing father. Eventually, she ends up recalling incidents from her youth before recounting a long-held secret to her aunt and cousins. The second story line focuses on the last day in Trujillo's life from the moment he wakes up onwards, and shows us the regime's inner circle, to which Urania's father once belonged. The third strand depicts Trujillo's assassins, many of whom had previously been government loyalists, as they wait for his car late that night; after the assassination, this story line shows us the assassins' persecution. Each aspect of the book's plot reveals a different viewpoint on the Dominican Republic's political and social environment, past and present.\nReaders are shown the regime's downward spiral, Trujillo's assassination, and its aftermath through the eyes of insiders, conspirators, and a middle-aged woman looking back. The novel is therefore a kaleidoscopic portrait of dictatorial power, including its psychological effects and its long-term impact.  The novel's themes include the nature of power and corruption, and their relationship to machismo or sexual perversion in a rigidly hierarchical society with strongly gendered roles. Memory, and the process of remembering, is also an important theme, especially in Urania's narrative as she recalls her youth in the Dominican Republic. Her story (and the book as a whole) ends when she recounts the terrible events that led to her leaving the country at the age of 14. \nVargas Llosa interlaces fictional elements and historical events: the book is not a documentary and the Cabral family, for instance, is completely fictional.  On the other hand, the characters of Trujillo and Trujillo's assassins are drawn from the historical record; Vargas Llosa weaves real historical incidents of brutality and oppression into these people's stories, to further illuminate the nature of the regime and the responses it provoked. In Vargas Llosa's words, \"It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties. [. . .] I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things in order to make the story more persuasive\u2014and I have not exaggerated.\"The Feast of the Goat received largely positive reviews, with several reviewers commenting on the book's depiction of the relationship between sexuality and power, as well as the graphic descriptions of violent events. It has been described as a powerful exploration of the atrocities associated with dictatorship, and a testament to the dangers of absolute power.A film version of the novel was released in 2005, starring Isabella Rossellini, Paul Freeman, and Tomas Milian.

Trujillo was, in historian Eric Roorda's words, \"a towering influence in Dominican and Caribbean history\" who presided over \"one of the most durable regimes of the twentieth century\" during the thirty-one years between his seizure of power in 1930 and his assassination in 1961. Trujillo had trained with the United States Marine Corps during the United States occupation of the island, and graduated from the Haina Military Academy in 1921. After the U.S. departed in 1924, he became head of the Dominican National Police which, under his command, was transformed into the Dominican National Army and Trujillo's personal \"virtually autonomous power base\".Trujillo was officially dictator only from 1930 to 1938, and from 1942 to 1952, but remained in effective power throughout the entire period. Though his regime was broadly nationalist, Daniel Chirot comments that he had \"no particular ideology\" and his economic and social policies were basically progressive.The novel's title is taken from the popular Dominican merengue Mataron al chivo (\"They Killed the Goat\"), which refers to Trujillo's assassination on May 30, 1961. Merengue is a style of music created by \u00d1ico Lora in the 1920s and actively promoted by Trujillo himself. It's now considered the country's national music. Cultural critics Julie Sellers and Stephen Ropp comment about this particular merengue that, by envisaging the dictator as an animal who could be turned into a stew (as frequently happened with goats struck down on the Dominican Republic's highways), the song \"gave those performing, listening to, and dancing to this merengue a sense of control over him and over themselves that they had not experienced for over three decades.\"  Vargas Llosa quotes the lyrics to Mataron al chivo at the beginning of his novel.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26560", "text": "The novel's narrative is divided into three distinct strands. One is centred on Urania Cabral, a fictional Dominican character; another deals with the conspirators involved in Trujillo's assassination; and the third focuses on Trujillo himself. The novel alternates between these storylines, while jumping back and forth from 1961 to 1996, with frequent flashbacks to periods earlier in Trujillo's regime.\nThe Feast of the Goat begins with the return of Urania to her hometown of Santo Domingo, a city which had been renamed Ciudad Trujillo during Trujillo's time in power. This storyline is largely introspective, dealing with Urania's memories and her inner turmoil over the events preceding her departure from the Dominican Republic thirty-five years earlier. Urania escaped the crumbling Trujillo regime in 1961 by claiming she planned to study under a tutelage of nuns in Michigan. In the following decades, she becomes a prominent and successful New York lawyer. She finally returns to the Dominican Republic in 1996, on a whim, before finding herself compelled to confront her father and elements of her past she has long ignored. As Urania speaks to her ailing father, Agustin Cabral, she recalls more and more of the anger and disgust that led to her thirty-five years of silence. Urania retells her father's descent into political disgrace, while revealing the betrayal that forms a crux between both Urania's storyline and that of Trujillo himself.\nThe second and third storylines are set in 1961, in the weeks prior to and following Trujillo's assassination on May 30. Each assassin has his own background story, explaining his motivation for their involvement in the assassination plot. Each has been wronged by Trujillo and his regime, by torture and brutality, or through assaults on their pride, religious faith, morality, and loved ones. Vargas Llosa weaves the tale of the men as memories recalled on the night of Trujillo's death, as the conspirators lie in wait for \"The Goat\". Interconnected with these stories are the actions of other famous Trujillistas of the time: Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, the puppet president; Johnny Abbes Garc\u00eda, the merciless head of the Military Intelligence Service (SIM); and various others\u2014some real, some composites of historical figures, and some purely fictional.\nThe third storyline is concerned with the thoughts and motives of Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo Molina himself. The chapters concerning The Goat recall the major events of his time, including the slaughter of thousands of Dominican Haitians in 1937. They also deal with the Dominican Republic's tense international relationships during the Cold War, especially with the United States under the presidency of John F. Kennedy and Cuba under Castro. Vargas Llosa also speculates upon Trujillo's innermost thoughts and paints a picture of a man whose physical body is slowly failing him. Trujillo is tormented by both his incontinence and impotence. Eventually, his storyline intersects with Urania's narrative when it's revealed that Urania was sexually assaulted by Trujillo. He is unable to achieve an erection with Urania and, in frustration, rapes her with his bare hands. This event is the core of Urania's shame and hatred towards her own father. In addition, it's the cause of Trujillo's repeated anger over the \"anemic little bitch\" who witnessed his impotence and emotion, as well as the reason he's en route to sleep with another girl on the night of his assassination.\nIn the novel's final chapters, the three storylines intersect with increasing frequency. The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture and death of the assassins at the hands of government agents, the failure of the coup, the rape of Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and escape the country.

Blending together these two elements is important in any historical novel, but especially in The Feast of the Goat because Vargas Llosa chose to narrate an actual event through the minds of both real and fictional characters. Some characters are fictional, and those that are non-fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book. The general details of the assassination are true, and the assassins are all real people. While they lie in wait for the Dictator to arrive, they recount actual crimes of the regime, such as the murder of the Mirabal sisters. However, other details are invented by Vargas Llosa, such as Amadito's murder of the brother of the woman he loved.Those within the regime are also a mix of fictional characters and real people. President Balaguer is real, but the entire Cabral family is completely fictional. According to Wolff, Vargas Llosa \"uses history as a starting point in constructing a fictionalized account of Trujillo's \"spiritual colonization\" of the Dominican Republic as experienced by one Dominican family. The fictional Cabral family allows Vargas Llosa to show two sides of the Trujillo regime: through Agustin, the reader sees ultimate dedication and sacrifice to the leader of the nation; through Urania, the violence of the regime and the legacy of pain it left behind. Vargas Llosa also fictionalized the internal thoughts of the characters who were non-fictional, especially those of the Goat himself. According to literary scholar Richard Patterson, \"Vargas Llosa's expands all the way into the very \"dark area\" of Trujillo's consciousness (as the storyteller dares to conceive it).\"Vargas Llosa also built an image of the regime with the troubled historical events. With regard to the historical accuracy of the book, Vargas Llosa has said \"It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties. The only limitation I imposed on myself was that I was not going to invent anything that couldn't have happened within the framework of life in the Dominican Republic.

He has been having recurring dreams for some time, of a tattooed girl covered in blood holding a giant sword surrounded by bodies, but they are now growing more frequent. It is the day his class graduates to become investigators for The Special Mobile Investigation Forces, or Tokki, which he joined to learn about his parents' death. Later on the day of his graduation, he sees the girl from his dream wearing a police uniform. She is Sakura Rokujo, who is in the same class as him and a member of Section 2, known officially as Special Public Safety Task Force, or Tokko. Its other main members include the young prodigy Kureha Suzuka, the silent strongman Takeru Inukai and its leader Ryoko Ibuki. There are many rumors about Tokko, one of which is that they use swords to execute criminals and that body parts are often found at the crime scenes Tokko investigates. There are also rumors that they aren't even human.\nWhen Ranmaru's unit investigates another grizzly murder, a witness claims to see a demon, which was also rumored at other bloody scenes. There they encounter humans with talking human faced larva parasites growing out of them, that are impervious to guns. The demons refer to Ranmaru as having the scent of Michida and attack, before he is saved by Sakura and Tokko. She explains that they were just lesser monsters controlled to target survivors of the Michida incident. Afterwards, Ranmaru's team researches previous violent dismemberments and learns that most have witnesses claiming to see demons and that the incidents have been on the rise since Michida. Sakura soon after reveals to Ranmaru that the Machida incident was caused by the monsters, which are demons from the otherworld. Five days before the incident, a box created by ancient philosophers and alchemists was opened that connects to the otherworld, the demons that came through committed the massacre. The stronger demons are called Phantoms and grow stronger by eating humans, these are the ones Tokko are tasked with finding and killing. The holes created by the earthquakes are the gates that allow them to enter the world. It is also confirmed that the main members of Tokko aren't fully human, referring to themselves as hunters.\nRanmaru and his best friend and partner Hanazono sneak into the closed off Machida crime scene to inspect the hole. When Ranmaru disturbs the hole by dropping something in it, a demon comes out an attacks them. Tokko arrives and saves them, and explains they are all survivors of Machida and the only ones that can defeat them as they have \"awakened\" into symbionts, having Phantoms inside them that protected them during the incident. The Machida hole is getting bigger and in two years will swallow Tokyo. The box that opened the gate was broken into 108 pieces, each of which is inside a Phantom, and Tokko collects the pieces in order to close the gate. The 12th Phantom, the one controlling the human faced larva parasites, then appears. Ranmaru asks Kureha Suzuka to show him how to awaken so he can fight, even after she warns him that he might not remain himself in which case they would have to kill him. To do so she mortally wounds him and throws him into the hole. When he emerges he completes the symbiosis with a giant demon, forming his tattoos and granting him two large swords, and defeats the Phantom in one attack. When he wakes up a week later, he is transferred to Tokko. In the epilogue it is hinted that two years later the hole did in fact swallow Tokyo.\nThe story then focuses on Itsuto Araragi and his sister Mayu in 2011, who are survivors of Michida and symbiont hunters unaffiliated with Tokko.

Her father, who works at the university, began experimenting and learned humans can become a hybrid of human and phantom by eating them and began to turn the students as well. He was the one who planted a larva in Yukino to make her commit suicide, after she saw him kill her mother. Using their newly absorbed abilities from the Phantoms at the school, Itsuto and Mayu defeat her father, with her finishes him off herself by setting their house on fire.

Like her brother, she gets targeted for assassination by the Phantom demons, as she was one of the survivors of the murders. When not in police work or in danger from being assassinated by the Phantoms, she nags Ranmaru like a mother, such as telling him to finish his food or go have himself checked up for any injuries.

Later on in the anime, she is forced to face her own brother when the symbionts inside of him possess him and turn him into evil.

He is insistent in finding out the reasons why Tokko exists and its agenda, to the cost of possibly losing his job over this. He is especially infuriated when Ranmaru leaves his division for Tokko. In the anime, he appears to have a daughter named Ruru (most likely a nickname) and is also a womanizer.\nBased on various side remarks on Kaoru during certain events in the series, it is apparent that he might have been a gangster in his youth before he decided to reform himself as a police officer. His rough behavior and language also fit the general stereotype of a yakuza.\nIchiro Hanazono\nVoiced by: Tadashi Mut\u014d (Japanese); Grant George (English)\nRanmaru's best friend and partner.

He planted a larva in Yukino to make her commit suicide when she walked in on him trying to force her mother to eat phantom and killed her when she refused.\nIn the anime her character is different, she is often referred to as the \"hottie from the crime lab\" by Ranmaru's colleagues. Her mother died prior to the Machida incident, with her father becoming obsessed with his research soon after. Saya set her and Ranmaru up on a blind date that ended up in them finding out more about the phantoms.

After other journalists investigated the article's claims and found significant discrepancies, Rolling Stone issued multiple apologies for the story.

Someone gets between her legs. Someone else kneels on her hair.

The work relates the tale of the young Arthur Gordon Pym, who stows away aboard a whaler called the Grampus. Various adventures and misadventures befall Pym, including shipwreck, mutiny, and cannibalism, before he is saved by the crew of the Jane Guy. Aboard this vessel, Pym and a sailor named Dirk Peters continue their adventures farther south. Docking on land, they encounter hostile, black-skinned natives before escaping back to the ocean. The novel ends abruptly as Pym and Peters continue toward the South Pole.\nThe story starts out as a fairly conventional adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange and hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from J. N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on possible autobiographical elements as well as its portrayal of race and the symbolism in the final lines of the work.\nDifficulty in finding literary success early in his short story-writing career inspired Poe to pursue writing a longer work. A few serialized installments of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket were first published in the Southern Literary Messenger, though never completed. The full novel was published in July 1838 in two volumes. Some critics responded negatively to the work for being too gruesome and for cribbing heavily from other works, while others praised its exciting adventures. Poe himself later called it \"a very silly book\". The novel later influenced Herman Melville and Jules Verne.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_26617", "text": "The book comprises a preface, 25 chapters, and an afterword, with a total of around 72,000 words.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26618", "text": "The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket has defied a universally accepted interpretation. Scholar Scott Peeples wrote that it is \"at once a mock nonfictional exploration narrative, adventure saga, bildungsroman, hoax, largely plagiarized travelogue, and spiritual allegory\" and \"one of the most elusive major texts of American literature.\" Biographer James M. Hutchisson writes that the plot both \"soars to new heights of fictional ingenuity and descends to new lows of silliness and absurdity\".One reason for the confusion comes from many continuity errors throughout the novel. For example, Pym notes that breaking a bottle while trapped in the hold saved his life because the sound alerted Augustus to his presence while searching. However, Pym notes that Augustus did not tell him this until \"many years elapsed\", even though Augustus is dead eight chapters later. Nevertheless, much of the novel is carefully plotted. Novelist John Barth notes, for example, that the midway point of the novel occurs when Pym reaches the equator, the midway point of the globe.Scholar Shawn Rosenheim believes that the use of hieroglyphs in the novel served as a precursor to Poe's interest in cryptography. The pictographs themselves were likely inspired by The Kentuckian in New-York (1834) by William Alexander Caruthers, where similar writing is the work of a black slave. Unlike the previous sea-voyage tales that Poe had written, such as \"MS. Found in a Bottle\", Pym is undertaking this trip on purpose. It has been suggested that the journey is about establishing a national American identity as well as discovering a personal identity.Poe also presents the effects of alcohol in the novel. The opening episode, for example, shows that intoxicated people can sometimes seem entirely sober and then, suddenly, the effects of alcohol show through. Such a depiction is a small version of a larger focus in the novel on contradictions between chaos and order. Even nature seems unnatural. Water, for example, is very different at the end of the novel, appearing either colorful or \"unnaturally clear.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26619", "text": "Poe had intended to collect a number of his early short stories into a volume titled Tales of the Folio Club in the 1830s. The collection would be unified as a series of tales presented by members of a literary association based on the Delphian Club, designed as burlesque of contemporary literary criticism. Poe had previously printed several of these stories in the Philadelphia Saturday Courier and the Baltimore Saturday Visiter.An editor, James Kirke Paulding, tried to assist him in publishing this collection. However, Paulding reported back to Poe that the publishers at Harper & Brothers declined the collection, saying that readers were looking for simple, long works like novels. They suggested, \"if he will lower himself a little to the ordinary comprehension of the generality of readers, and prepare... a single work... they will make such arrangements with him as will be liberal and satisfactory.\" They suggested \"if other engagements permit... undertake a Tale in a couple volumes, for that is the magical number.\" The response from Harper & Brothers inspired Poe to begin a long work and began writing The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. Poe arranged with his boss at the Southern Literary Messenger to publish his novel in several serialized installments at a pay rate of $3 per page.However, Poe retired from his role at the Messenger on January 3, 1837, as the installments were being published; some scholars suggest he was fired and this led him to abandoning the novel. His split with the Messenger began a \"blank period\" where he did not publish much and suffered from unemployment, poverty, and no success in his literary pursuits. Poe soon realized writing a book-length narrative was a necessary career decision, partly because he had no steady job and the economy was suffering from the Panic of 1837. He also set part of the story as a quest to Antarctica to capitalize the public's sudden interest in that topic.After his marriage to Virginia Clemm, Poe spent the following winter and spring completing his manuscript for this novel in New York. He earned a small amount of money by taking in a boarder named William Gowans. During his fifteen months in New York, amidst the harsh economic climate, Poe published only two tales, \"Von Jung, the Mystific\" and \"Siope. A Fable\". Harper & Brothers announced Poe's novel would be published in May 1837, but the Panic forced them to delay.The novel was finally published in book form under the title The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket in July 1838, although it did not include Poe's name and was instead presented as an account by Pym himself. Poe excused the earlier serialized version by noting that the Messenger had mistakenly adapted it \"under the garb of fiction\". As Harper & Brothers recommended, it was printed in two volumes. Its full subtitle was:\n\nComprising the Details of Mutiny and Atrocious Butchery on Board the American Brig Grampus, on Her Way to the South Seas, in the Month of June, 1827. With an Account of the Recapture of the Vessel by the Survivers; Their Shipwreck and Subsequent Horrible Sufferings from Famine; Their Deliverance by Means of the British Schooner Jane Guy; the Brief Cruise of this Latter Vessel in the Atlantic Ocean; Her Capture, and the Massacre of Her Crew Among a Group of Islands in the Eighty-Fourth Parallel of Southern Latitude; Together with the Incredible Adventures and Discoveries Still Farther South to Which That Distressing Calamity Gave Rise.\nThe first overseas publication of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket appeared only a few months later when it was printed in London without Poe's permission, although the final paragraph was omitted.

Fifteen months after its publication, it was reviewed by Lewis Gaylord Clark, a fellow author who carried on a substantial feud with Poe. His review printed in The Knickerbocker said the book was \"told in a loose and slip-shod style, seldom chequered by any of the more common graces of composition.\" Clark went on, \"This work is one of much interest, with all its defects, not the least of which is that it is too liberally stuffed with 'horrid circumstances of blood and battle.'\"Many reviewers commented on the excess of violent scenes. In addition to noting the novel's gruesome details, a review in Burton's Gentleman's Magazine (possibly William Evans Burton himself) criticized its borrowed descriptions of geography and errors in nautical information. The reviewer considered it a literary hoax and called it an \"impudent attempt at humbugging the public\" and regretted \"Mr. Poe's name in connexion with such a mass of ignorance and effrontery\". Poe later wrote to Burton that he agreed with the review, saying it \"was essentially correct\" and the novel was \"a very silly book\".Other reviews condemned the attempt at presenting a true story. A reviewer for the Metropolitan Magazine noted that, though the story was good as fiction, \"when palmed upon the public as a true thing, it cannot appear in any other light than that of a bungling business\u2014an impudent attempt at imposing on the credulity of the ignorant.\" Nevertheless, some readers believed portions of Poe's novel were true, especially in England, and justified the absurdity of the book with an assumption that author Pym was exaggerating the truth. Publisher George Putnam later noted that \"whole columns of these new 'discoveries', including the hieroglyphics (sic) found on the rocks, were copied by many of the English country papers as sober historical truth.\"In contrast, 20th-century Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, who admitted Poe as a strong influence, praised the novel as \"Poe's greatest work\". He later included one of the species invented for the story in his dictionary of fantastical creatures, the Book of Imaginary Beings, in a chapter titled \"an animal dreamt by Poe\". H. G. Wells noted that \"Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago\". Even so, most scholars did not engage in much serious discussion or analysis of the novel until the 1950s, though many in France recognized the work much earlier. In 2013, The Guardian cited The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket as one of the 100 best novels written in English, and noted its influence on later authors such as Henry James, Arthur Conan Doyle, B. Traven and David Morrell.The financial and critical failure of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was a turning point in Poe's career. For one, he was driven to literary duties that would make him money, notably his controversial role as editor of The Conchologist's First Book in April 1839. He also wrote a short series called \"Literary Small Talk\" for a new Baltimore-based magazine called American Museum of Science, Literature and the Arts.In need of work, Poe accepted a job at the low salary of $10 per week as assistant editor for Burton's Gentleman's Magazine, despite their negative review of his novel. He also returned to his focus on short stories rather than longer works of prose; Poe's next published book after this, his only completed novel, was the collection Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque in 1840.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A popular piece of writing until its loss, the Consolatio is widely accepted as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic.

Tullia (August 5, 79 BC or 78 BC \u2013 February 45 BC), Cicero's daughter, died in the winter of 45 BC after giving birth to her second son; this caused Cicero to go into a period of deep mourning.Cicero decided to stay with his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus for a time, during which he perused Atticus's library, reading any and all books that dealt with overcoming grief. Unsatisfied with what he found, he relocated to his villa at Astura, where he composed the Consolatio. (It was during this time that he also wrote the famed\u2014and now lost\u2014dialogue Hortensius.)

Centuries later, the Christian theologian Jerome, in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian, makes a similar reference, writing that the Consolatio was heavily based on Crantor's ancient work De Luctu (\"On Grief\"). Some have suggested that Cicero \"followed Crantor exclusively or even principally\" when composing the Consolatio, but David Scourfield repudiates this view, arguing it was more likely that Cicero's Consolatio simply agreed with Crantor rather than slavishly duplicated his work.Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, as well as the structure of Cicero's reply. From the snippets that remain of the work, it would appear that the piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her deification must both be approved of by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he writes that he will build Tullia a memorial in a well-known location. Cicero also lists a number of famous individuals who have been deified to justify his proposed apotheosis of Tullia.The only extant pieces of the Consolatio are fragments, one of which was preserved by Cicero himself in his Tusculanae Disputationes. Seven other fragments were preserved by the early Christian author Lactantius in his work Institutiones Divinae (The Divine Institutes). Lactantius used the excerpts from the Consolatio both to point out the futility of paganism, as well as to argue that pagans actually accept some tenets of Christianity without them even realizing it. Lactantius criticized what Cicero wrote, but he also applauded Cicero at times for paralleling\u2014albeit coincidentally\u2014what the Bible says. However, the lines preserved by Lactantius have been criticized due to their lack of context. MacKendrick notes that Lactantius was using \"partial quotation[s]\" in order to frame what Cicero wrote so that Lactantius could more easily refute his ideas.Another important reference to the work can be found in the aforementioned letter by Jerome addressed to Heliodorus; Jerome noted that the Consolatio contained references to \"men who showed equal fortitude in sorrow and war\", namely: Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, Cato the Elder, Quintus Gallius, Gaius Calpurnius Piso, Lucius Junius Brutus, Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur, Scaurus, Quintus Marcius Rex, Publius Licinius Crassus, and Gnaeus Aufidius Orestes, as well as members of the Metellus and Marcellus families.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26661", "text": "The Consolatio was of major importance, and Scourfield argues that it is the distinct work that introduced the Greek consolatio tradition to the Romans of the late Republic.

Aksionov laughs off her concern that the nightmare was a premonition and interprets the dream as a sign of luck.\nHalfway to the town, Aksionov encounters a fellow merchant, whom he befriends. The two stop for the night at an inn, where they have tea together and sleep in adjoining rooms. Aksionov rises before dawn and sets off with his horses and coachman while the air is cool. After twenty-five miles, he stops to feed his horses.\nDuring this break, two soldiers, accompanied by an official, arrive and question Aksionov about his relationship with the merchant he met the previous night, before revealing to him that the merchant was found dead with his throat slit. Since the two rooms were next to each other, it seems only natural that Aksionov might know something. Aksionov trembles in fear when the official searches his belongings and removes a bloodstained knife.\nThe men bind and arrest Aksionov. His wife visits him in jail and faints at the sight of him dressed as a criminal. He says they must petition the czar, to which she says she has already tried to no avail. She asks him if he committed the murder, and Aksionov weeps. If even his wife suspects him, he thinks after she leaves, then only God knows the truth and it is only to God that he should appeal.\nHe puts his faith in God and accepts his sentencing and ceremonial flogging. He is sent to work in the Siberian mines. Over twenty-six years in Siberia, Aksionov transforms into a pious old man. His hair turns white, his beard grows long, he walks with difficulty, and he never laughs. He prays often and, among other prisoners, he develops a reputation as a meek and fair man.\nOne day a newly arrived inmate named Makar Semyonich, who is about the same age as Aksionov and from the same hometown, gives an account of what brought him to Siberia. He was suspected of stealing a horse when in reality he had only borrowed it. Nevertheless, he was convicted and imprisoned. The irony is that he had gotten away with doing something much worse earlier in his life.\nAksionov suspects the man is responsible for framing him. He questions Semyonich, who cryptically responds in a way that confirms Aksionov's suspicion. Aksionov remembers everything he has lost and is plunged into misery; he longs for a way to get revenge but resolves to stay away from the man or even look in his direction. After two weeks, unable to sleep, Aksionov strolls the prison when he discovers Semyonich digging a tunnel under his sleeping shelf. Semyonich angrily offers Aksionov escape and threatens to kill him should he tell the authorities about the tunnel. Aksionov says Semyonich has already taken his life, and he shall do as God directs him.\nSoldiers discover the tunnel the next day. The governor arrives to question prisoners, none of whom admit to knowing anything about the tunnel. After wrestling with his desire for vengeance, Aksionov declines to say what he knows about Semyonich's involvement, even if it means that he will be punished himself.\nThat night, Aksionov is about to nod off in his bunk when Semyonich sits down beside him. Semyonich bends over and whispers a plea for forgiveness. He confesses that it was he who killed the other merchant and stole his money; he then planted the knife so that Aksionov would become the suspect. He falls to his knees and begs for forgiveness, promising to confess to the crimes so that Aksionov will go free. The old man replies that his life is already over and he has nowhere to go.\nAt the sight of Semyonich's tears, Aksionov weeps himself. Semyonich begs again for forgiveness. Aksionov tells him that God will forgive him, and that perhaps he himself is a hundred times worse. Having said this, Aksionov feels a lightness enter his body.

One notable exception to this general agreement is Peter Singer, who argues that, despite our intuitions, a utilitarian calculus implies that one is morally obliged to stay connected to the violinist.The most common objection is that Thomson's violinist argument can justify abortion only in cases of rape, though Thomson uses separate analogies to argue in cases other than rape. In the violinist scenario, the pregnant woman was kidnapped: she did not consent to having the violinist plugged into her and she did nothing to cause the violinist to be plugged in, just as a woman who is pregnant due to rape did nothing to cause the pregnancy. But in some cases of abortion, the pregnant woman had voluntary intercourse, and thus has either tacitly consented to allow the fetus to use her body (the tacit consent objection), or else has a duty to sustain the fetus because the pregnant woman herself caused the fetus to stand in need of her body (the responsibility objection). Other common objections turn on the claim that the fetus is the pregnant woman's child, whereas the violinist is a stranger (the stranger versus offspring objection), or that abortion directly and intentionally kills the fetus, whereas unplugging the violinist merely lets him die of natural causes (the killing versus letting die objection).Defenders of Thomson's argument reply that the alleged disanalogies between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion do not matter, either because the factors that critics appeal to are not genuinely morally relevant, or because those factors are morally relevant but do not apply to abortion in the way that critics have claimed. Thomson's defenders also point to her 'people-seeds' argument as a strong analogy to typical cases of abortion.Thomson's article, by positing a moral justification for abortion even if one grants a fetal right to life, opened up a new avenue in the philosophical debate about the ethics of abortion. Critics of her view have formulated many objections to her argument, and defenders have responded in kind in a back and forth that continues in philosophy journals.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It follows a non-linear narrative in the form of a sort of \"confession\" authored by Trumper, who humorously recounts his various failures in life and love, from his New England childhood through his experiences on foreign study in Vienna, Austria, and as a graduate student in Iowa, leading up to the present-action setting, early-1970s New York, where Trumper is attempting to sever himself from his adolescent past. \"I want to change\", Trumper says at the end of Chapter One. The phrase seems to be the novel's central theme.\nThe title refers to a method prescribed to Trumper for the treatment of non-specific urological disorders relating to his abnormally narrow urinary tract. Trumper's urologist, Dr. Jean Claude Vigneron, offers him three options for the treatment of his disorder: abstinence from sex and alcohol, a painful operation to widen the urinary canal, or the Water Method, which consists simply of consuming abnormal quantities of water before and after sex to flush bacteria out of the urinary tract. Trumper opts for the Water Method, suggesting both his generally comical cowardice and lack of self-discipline.\nTrumper's narration meanders through flashbacks revolving around his relationships with the novel's two primary female characters: Sue \"Biggie\" Kunft, a former championship downhill skier whom Trumper courts, impregnates, and marries in Vienna while still a student, and Tulpen, Trumper's present day live-in girlfriend, a documentary film editor in New York, where he lands after losing Biggie. Though the two relationships function chiefly as a means of demonstrating Bogus Trumper's tendency to repeat his mistakes, Irving is often noted for his strong, independent female characters, and Tulpen and Biggie can be seen as markers in the development of the strong women in his more popularly successful novels, particularly The World According to Garp (1979).\nOther characters include Trumper's best childhood friend Couth, a still-photographer; Merrill Overturf, an alcoholic and diabetic loon Trumper befriends in Vienna; Ralph Packer, a pretentious documentary filmmaker who employs Trumper as a sound editor; and Colm, Trumper's young son from his first marriage to Biggie.\nTrumper is a graduate student at the University of Iowa in comparative literature whose thesis is to be a translation of an ancient, \"Old Low Norse\" epic called \"Akthelt and Gunnel\".

In the last two lines (the couplet) the speaker says that his verse will live on and therefore make the beauty of the beloved immortal.\nThe sonnet compares minutes to waves on a pebbled shore regularly replacing each other. Time is also depicted as a gift giver and also as a gift destroyer.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26733", "text": "Sonnet 60 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The Shakespearean sonnet contains three quatrains followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the form's typical rhyme, abab cdcd efef gg and is written a type of poetic metre called iambic pentameter based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The thirteenth line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:\n\n\u00d7    /   \u00d7  /    \u00d7   /    \u00d7  /      \u00d7     / \nAnd yet to times in hope my verse shall stand, (60.13)\n\n/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = nonictus.Helen Vendler calls Sonnet 60 \"one of the perfect examples of the 4-4-4-2 Shakespearean sonnet form\".  According to Vendler, \"Each quatrain introduces a new and important modification in concept and tone, while the couplet\u2014here a \"reversing\" couplet contradicting the body of the sonnet\u2014adds yet a fourth dimension\".  In other words, Vendler is arguing that each section of the poem offers new insight and content; therefore, there are four distinct parts or \"dimensions\" of the sonnet\u2014each quatrain is not merely expressing the same idea, while the couplet is not simply summarizing the quatrains.Sonnet 60 incorporates a large number of trochees, feet with a metrically strong followed by a metrically weak syllabic position (/ \u00d7) in place of an iamb (\u00d7 /). Vendler writes that the first two lines of the sonnet begin with trochees, which \"draw attention to the hastening of the waves, the attacks by eclipses and by Time, and the countervailing praising by verse\". According to Robert Arbour, after these initial trochees, Shakespeare ends each of these first two lines with a \"calm, iambic meter\". Arbour argues that this sensation of waves crashing culminates at the beginning of the third line, in which a spondee, a foot with two stressed syllables, represents this climax.  However, Carl Atkins claims that the first two lines are \"answered directly by two regular lines\".  Despite this disagreement, both critics acknowledge that the non-iambic feet simulate the undulating and crashing waves that Shakespeare portrays in the first line of the sonnet.  While Vendler emphasizes the meter of the first quatrain, Atkins and Arbour continue this analysis by examining the second quatrain.  After the first quatrain, the next trochee occurs in the middle of line 5, the only medial trochee of the sonnet, followed by trochees at the beginning of the sixth and seventh lines.  The sixth and seventh lines mirror the first two lines of the sonnet in form, drawing attention to their common theme of birth\u2014the waves near the shore and children grow toward maturity\u2014and death\u2014minutes reach their conclusion as the children's glory is destroyed.  The non-linear pattern of the second quatrain also draws attention to the quatrain's \"slowness and repeated breaks [which suggest] the labour of human life which Time hinders at every step\".  This contrasts greatly with the \"smoothness of the first quatrain, describing the work of time, in which each line [after the initial trochee] runs to its end like the ripple to which it compares the succession of minutes\".  Therefore, while these three critics may examine and emphasize different aspects of the meter in the sonnet, all three maintain that the meter helps convey and facilitate the main themes of the sonnet.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26734", "text": "This poem has many competing images, including time, conflict, and the sea. In Stephen Booth's thorough criticism of Sonnet 60, he remarks that of the battle that the speaker attempts to wage against time in his effort to be together with the youth. The words chosen by Shakespeare such as toil, transfix, fight, contend, glory, confound, and scythe all hint at a violent conflict to which the speaker finds himself irreversibly attached. The conflict of the speaker relates to how best to solve the problem of time, yet he initially sees no counter to time's devastating attacks.Lopez dives into more detail about this conflict, focusing on the death and destruction that Sonnet 60 describes The second quatrain explains life's cycle, presenting the journey from birth to death and from sunrise to eclipse or sunset as ways to explicate the feeling of loss after having so much. It culminates in the pessimism that all that was ever had, has been or will be lost. He explains the third quatrain as the degradation of his fascination's beauty, that the weapons that time methodically uses to slowly strip what the speaker values is a crushing blow. The completeness of time's destruction is made clear as if man's beauty and goodness are created only for time to demolish.Helen Vendler sees the conflict that both Booth and Lopez are picking up on, but also adds the idea of the different concepts of time that Shakespeare develops. The waves upon the shore, beating endlessly as the minutes beat upon the hours, is the stationary model, showing the consistency and terminality of the speaker's enemy. She also describes a model of rise and fall, characterizing the tragic model.  Similar to the shape of a human lifespan, with a rise from immaturity and incompetence, climaxing at a stage most able, and then steadily falling away from the high point of life and towards entropy, the second quatrain shows this parabolic idea of existence, from which Shakespeare longs to escape. The third quatrain gives Vendler the specific images that Booth and Lopez refer to the violent encounter between the speaker and time, and how time speedily spoils all the speaker enjoys. While Booth and Lopez see the conflict Shakespeare is ensnared by as one of the main points to take away from this sonnet, Vendler examines the confusion of these models interacting with each other, suggesting an inner conflict as more pressing than his external conflict about time and its destructive and unwanted powers.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26735", "text": "Sonnet 60 appears as part of a larger collection of 154 sonnets published in 1609 under the title \"Shakespeare's Sonnets\".  Sonnets 1-126, or the \"Fair Youth\" sequence, are commonly thought to be addressed to a young man, though that man's identity is not known. It is believed that the majority of the sonnets were written in the 1590s, including Sonnet 60 (xxix).\nThe historical context in which Shakespeare wrote Sonnet 60, especially matters concerning time, provide an interpretive key to the poem. By the 1590s, when Shakespeare wrote Sonnet 60, England was in the midst of a period of unprecedented colonization, industry, and commerce. Charles Andrews points out in his History of England that in the era of Elizabeth, England entered its period of \"modern history\"  and had \"become a power of first rank\". The Spanish Armada had been defeated in 1588. At the same time, coinage became standardized. The English East India Company launched its first spice trading expedition in 1598, and England began its first colonization attempts in North America.  In commerce, industry and wealth, England experienced unprecedented growth and all of these areas were, by the 1590s, all \"regulated and controlled by the state\".\nAs England became more powerful and regulated, the accurate measurement of time became crucial to the country's well-being. The accurate measurement of time helped in standardizing the payment of wages for labor, regulating industry, and keeping governance efficient. By the 16th century \"life in the cities had become equated with life by the clock\", and by the late 16th century, the first minute hands began to appear on public (and private) clocks. Time in the London of 1609 had become highly measured, increasingly accurate, and integrated into the social order; people \"ruled themselves by the clock\". Dympna Callaghan in the essay, \"Confounded by Winter, Speeding Time in Shakespeare's Sonnets\", states that Sonnet 60 is one of two sonnets (also 12) which are \"keenly concerned with time\" and are given the \"significantly symbolic numbers\". Sonnet 12 concerns the 12 hours on the face of a clock and Sonnet 60 concerns \"our minutes\".  These two sonnets, therefore, Callaghan says, \"bespeak mechanical time\" and their number signifies the importance of the modern measurement of time.\nThis \"measured\" and \"mechanical\" time-keeping changed the way persons experienced time. Time in the ancient world had been marked by the rising of the sun and its setting, the seasons, or the lunar and solar events, by birth and death. With the coming of modern measurements of time, Daniel Boorstin in The Discoverers states that \"mankind [was] liberated from the monotony of nature\"  and \"[t]he flow of shadows, sand and water translated into the clock's staccato, became a useful measure  of man's movement across the planet\"  (1).

Living in poverty in the slum of Red Hook at the time of writing, Lovecraft was at this time urgently attempting to widen his markets in the pulp magazines.

Peter describes an international corporation which was formed in the last days of World War II, composed of financiers, influential members of large corporations, and Nazi brass.  He gives Ben a photo of some of the leaders, only to find out that their father was a member.  Soon, Peter is killed by an assassin, and Ben escapes with his life again.

Her probes turn up false leads, possible coverups, and dead ends, until she finds out that the men have been poisoned by someone using the same obscure toxin.  Following the leads, she finds that the men she had been assigned to investigate are part of an international group of financiers and business moguls.

It is learned that Sigma has grown from a simple attempt to plunder the Nazi treasury and stabilize the industrial and financial state of the world in the wake of the war, to a political and financial machine which controls as many as 75% of the world's leading companies, and has enough covert political clout to directly influence the outcome of the likes of Presidential elections.

Philadelphia is now the capital of the United States. Although the Mexican-born US President George W. Romney is nominally in office, the country is effectively under martial law. The Soviets have been utterly devastated by American nuclear strikes. Cuba is an atomic ruin, with Spain responsible for relief efforts to aid what is left of the island's population.\nOne consequence of the war is that the US embroilment in Vietnam is abruptly curtailed. US military personnel in South Vietnam and the rest of the world are withdrawn to stabilize the US in the aftermath of the Soviet missile and air strikes. The People's Republic of China has also collapsed, with numerous regional warlords waging a civil war against one another.\nUS nuclear strikes on the Soviets led to the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and to the release of a massive fallout cloud over much of Asia that kills millions of those who survived the destruction of the Soviets. As a consequence, the US has become a pariah in the eyes of much of the world. Many governments regard members of the US Air Force as war criminals, and its servicemen are advised not to travel abroad. After the 1962 war, nearly all the remaining countries of the globe have renounced possession of nuclear weapons.

The United Kingdom and Canada remain American allies and actively assist in post-war reconstruction efforts in US states that were hit the hardest by the war. The British, since 1962, have managed to regain much of their pre-1939 colonial confidence in the vacuum that is left by the destruction of the Soviet Union and the emasculation of the US in world affairs. The policy of decolonization has been halted and even reversed. Some newly independent nations even return to the remaining British \"Empire\" in the new uncertain world that was created after the \"Cuban War.\" British aid is welcome, but there is also a sense of resentment among the American population over its excessive dependence on the British. The large presence of British and Canadian military personnel in the United States is also a source of contention, and some Americans wonder whether their allies possess ulterior motives.\nThe story covers two parallel plotlines. One involves Landry's attempts to discover what happened in Washington, DC, in October 1962. US military propaganda accounts maintain that the Cuban War broke out because of John F. Kennedy's recklessness and incompetence; those claims are generally believed. Kennedy and his officials are regarded as butchers and war criminals and the only senior surviving member of his inner circle, McGeorge Bundy, is imprisoned in Fort Leavenworth. In contrast, US military commanders (notably the Chief of the Air Force, General \"Rammer\" Curtis, based on the real-life General Curtis LeMay) are portrayed as the saviors of the nation. During the course of the novel, Landry gradually discovers that it was Kennedy who sought to prevent the crisis over Cuba from escalating into war and that last-minute attempts to achieve a deal with Nikita Khrushchev to end the crisis were deliberately sabotaged by Curtis and other generals.\nThe other plotline concerns British-American relations.

The Thing is often filled with anger, self-loathing and self-pity over his new existence. He serves as \"an uncle figure, a long-term friend of the family with a gruff Brooklyn manner, short temper, and caustic sense of humor\".:\u200a204\u200a In the original synopsis Lee gave to Kirby, The Thing was intended as \"the heavy\", but over the years, the character has become \"the most lovable group member: honest, direct and free of pretension\".:\u200a86\u200a Lee said his original pitch to Kirby stated that The Thing was \"someone who turned into a monster\" and is bitter because unlike the other three he cannot change back to a normal appearance.The Fantastic Four has had several headquarters, most notably the Baxter Building, located at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue in New York City.

Hoping for diversion, they accept an assignment from queen Phoria to go to Seregil's homeland and call Klia to Skala. En route, however, they are ambushed and separated, and both are sold into slavery to the Plenimarans.\nThere they are bought by the alchemist Yhakobin who hopes to use Alec's H\u00e2zadrielfaie blood to create a rhekaro, a sexless creature that can heal everything and prolong life. The first doesn't meet his expectations and he has it butchered. Alec takes pity on the rhekaro and hates Yhakobin  for torturing and killing it, and is determined to save the second one from a similar fate. Increasingly, Alec feels paternal towards rhekaro, who has Alec's own face - reminding himself of the Dragon Oracle's prophecy that he would \"beget a child of no woman\". Eventually, Seregil and Alec escape, the first with the help of a servant woman and the second by picking his lock. Knowing that the rhekaro will die without his blood, Alec is determined to save him and takes him along, while Seregil brings his betrayer, Ilar \u00ed Sontir, to show them a secret tunnel.\nThe atmosphere is initially tense when Alec finds Ilar's identity and Seregil, too, has doubts about the uncommon-looking child, but they fare well for several days, with Alec's hunting skills and the food they had stolen. Later, the rhekaro, whom Alec names Sebrahn, shows extraordinary healing powers, which they use to get rid of their slave brands so that they are not found out by other slavers.\nNear the port they are found by their former master.

The German intelligence agency, the Nachrichtendienst, discovers that the Allies are in need of gyroscopes, and proposes an exchange, to take place in neutral territory: Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nDavid Spaulding has, in the meantime, become an invaluable spy for the Allies.

The first thread is set in a 1998 ravaged by ecological disasters such as algal blooms and diebacks on the brink of large scale extinctions. Various other events are mentioned in passing, such as student riots and an event of nuclear terrorism against New York City that took place before the events of the novel. This thread follows a group of scientists in the United Kingdom connected with the University of Cambridge and their attempts to warn the past of the impending disaster by sending tachyon-induced messages to the astronomical position the Earth occupied in 1962\u20131963. Given the faster-than-light nature of the tachyon, these messages will effectively reach the past. These efforts are led by John Renfrew, an Englishman, and Gregory Markham, an American most likely modeled on Benford himself.The second thread is set at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), in La Jolla, California in 1962, where a young scientist, Gordon Bernstein, discovers anomalous noise in a physics experiment relating to spontaneous resonance and indium antimonide. He and his student assistant, Albert Cooper (also likely based on the author and his experiences at UCSD), discover that the noise is coming in bursts timed to form Morse code.\nThe resulting message is made of staccato sentence fragments and jumbled letters, due to the 1998 team's efforts to avoid a grandfather paradox. Their aim is to give the past researchers enough information to start efforts on solving the pending ecological crisis, but not enough that the crisis will be entirely solved (thus making a signal to the past unnecessary and creating a paradox).\nDue to the biological nature of the message, Professor Bernstein shares the message with a professor of biology, Michael Ramsey. Since the message also gives astronomical coordinates, he also shares it with Saul Shriffer, a fictional scientist who is said to have worked with Frank Drake on Project Ozma. Initially, these characters fail to understand the true meaning of the message. Ramsey believes it to be an intercepted military dispatch hinting at Soviet bioterrorism, while Shriffer thinks the message is of extraterrestrial origin. Shriffer goes public with this theory, mentioning Bernstein in his findings. However, Bernstein's overseer, Isaac Lakin, is skeptical of the messages and wants Bernstein to keep working on his original project and ignore the signal. As a result of this interruption in their experimentation, Bernstein is denied a promotion and Cooper fails a candidacy examination. The signal also exacerbates difficulties in Bernstein's relationship with his girlfriend, Penny.\nIn 1998, Ian Peterson recovers a safe deposit box in La Jolla containing a piece of paper indicating that the messages were received. Meanwhile, it is clear that the viral nature of the algal bloom is spreading it faster and through more media than originally expected. Strange yellow clouds that have been appearing are said to be a result of the viral material being absorbed through the water cycle, and it soon affects the planet's agriculture as well, resulting in widespread cases of food poisoning. Flying to the United States, Markham is killed in a plane crash when the pilots fly too close to one of the clouds and experience seizures.\nIn the past storyline, now advanced into 1963, Bernstein refuses to give up on the signals. He is rewarded when the signal noise is also observed in a laboratory at Columbia University (a nod towards the inventor of the tachyon concept, Gerald Feinberg of Columbia). Using hints in the message, Ramsey replicates the conditions of the bloom in a controlled experiment and realizes the danger it represents. Bernstein finds out that the astronomical coordinates given in the message represent where the Earth will be in 1998 due to the solar apex. He also receives a more coherent, despairing message from the future. Having built a solid case, Bernstein goes public and publishes his results.\nThis decision has monumental consequences. On November 22, a high school student in Dallas is sent by his physics teacher to the Texas School Book Depository to get a copy of Bernstein's findings. There he interrupts Lee Harvey Oswald's assassination attempt on President John F. Kennedy, attacking the shooter and sending the would-be fatal third shot awry. Though seriously injured, Kennedy survives. This paradox creates an alternate universe and forever ends the contact with the original 1998.\nThe concluding chapters portray the 1998 of the original timeline as a bleak, failing world, the intensified ecological disaster taking a noticeable toll on the human way of life. Peterson retreats to a fortified country farmhouse which he has obviously prepared well in advance. Renfrew continues to send out signals (including the more coherent one that Gordon receives) until the building's generator gives out. Before it does, however, he receives a signal purportedly from the year 2349.\nIn the final chapter, set in the alternate 1974, an awards ceremony is held for achievement in science. In light of Kennedy's survival, the United States President giving out the awards is William Scranton, who is said to have defeated Bobby Kennedy due to a telephone tapping scandal. The scientists whose work stemmed from the signal are honored, including Bernstein, who receives the Enrico Fermi Prize for his discovery of the tachyon.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is set in an unnamed city that is experiencing a revolutionary uprising in the streets; most of the action takes place in an upmarket brothel that functions as a microcosm of the regime of the establishment under threat outside.Since Peter Zadek directed the first English-language production at the Arts Theatre Club in London in 1957, the play has been revived frequently (in various versions) and has attracted many prominent directors, including Peter Brook, Erwin Piscator, Roger Blin, Giorgio Strehler, and JoAnne Akalaitis. It has been adapted as a film and given operatic treatment. The play's dramatic structure integrates Genet's concern with meta-theatricality and role-playing, and consists of two central strands: a political conflict between revolution and counter-revolution and a philosophical one between reality and illusion. Genet suggested that the play should be performed as a \"glorification of the Image and the Reflection.\"Genet's biographer Edmund White wrote that with The Balcony, along with The Blacks (1959), Genet re-invented modern theatre. The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan described the play as the rebirth of the spirit of the classical Athenian comic playwright Aristophanes, while the philosopher Lucien Goldmann argued that despite its \"entirely different world view\" it constitutes \"the first great Brechtian play in French literature.\" Martin Esslin has called The Balcony \"one of the masterpieces of our time.\"", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_26856", "text": "Most of the action takes place in an upmarket brothel in which its madam, Irma, \"casts, directs, and co-ordinates performances in a house of infinite mirrors and theaters.\" Genet uses this setting to explore roles of power in society; in the first few scenes patrons assume the roles of a bishop who forgives a penitent, a judge who punishes a thief, and a general who rides his horse. Meanwhile, a revolution is progressing outside in the city and the occupants of the brothel anxiously await the arrival of the Chief of Police. Chantal, one of the prostitutes, has quit the brothel to become the embodiment of the spirit of the revolution. An Envoy from the Queen arrives and reveals that the pillars of society (the Chief Justice, the Bishop, the General, etc.) have all been killed in the uprising. Using the costumes and props in Irma's \"house of illusions\" (the traditional French name for a brothel), the patrons' roles are realised when they pose in public as the figures of authority in a counter-revolutionary effort to restore order and the status quo.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26857", "text": "The Balcony exists in three distinct versions, published in French in 1956, 1960, and 1962.

The second version is the longest and most political. The third version is shorter and reduces the political content of the scene with the caf\u00e9 revolutionaries. Bernard Frechtman's first English translation (published in 1958) was based on Genet's second version, while Frechtman's second, revised English translation (published in 1966) was based on Genet's third version. A translation by Barbara Wright and Terry Hands, which the RSC used in its 1987 production, incorporates scenes and elements from all three versions.Genet wrote the first version of the play between January and September 1955, during which time he also wrote The Blacks and re-worked his screenplay The Penal Colony. Immediately afterwards, in October and November the same year, he wrote Her, a posthumously published one-act play about the pope, which is related to The Balcony. Genet took his initial inspiration for The Balcony from Franco's Spain, explaining in a 1957 article that:\n\nMy point of departure was situated in Spain, Franco's Spain, and the revolutionary who castrates himself was all those Republicans when they had admitted their defeat. And then my play continued to grow in its own direction and Spain in another.\nGenet was particularly interested at the time in newspaper reports of two projects for massive tombs: the Caudillo's own colossal memorial near Madrid, the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos (\"Valley of the Fallen\"), where he was buried in 1975, and the projected mausoleum of Aga Khan III in Aswan, Egypt. They provided the source for the Chief of Police's longing for a great mausoleum and the founding of a funerary cult around him in the play. The meditations on the contrast between Being and Doing that the Bishop articulates in the first scene recall the \"two irreducible systems of values\" that Jean-Paul Sartre suggested in Saint Genet (1952) Genet \"uses simultaneously to think about the world.\"Marc Barbezat's company L'Arbal\u00e8te published the first version of The Balcony in June 1956; the artist Alberto Giacometti created several lithographs based on the play that appeared on its cover (including a tall, dignified Irma, the Bishop who was made to resemble Genet, and the General with his whip). Genet dedicated this version to Pierre Joly, a young actor and Genet's lover at the time. Genet began to re-write the play in late October 1959 and again in May 1960, the latter prompted by its recent production under the direction of Peter Brook. He worked on the third version between April and October 1961, during which time he also read Friedrich Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy (1872), a work of dramatic theory that was to become one of Genet's favourite books and a formative influence on his ideas about the role of myth and ritual in post-realist theatre.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26858", "text": "The philosopher Lucien Goldmann suggests that the themes of The Balcony may be divided between those that are essential and primary and those that are non-essential and secondary. Those that we may recognise from Genet's earlier work\u2014the double, the mirror, sexuality, dream-death vs. reality-impure life\u2014belong to the secondary level, he argues, while the play's essential theme is a clear and comprehensible analysis of the transformation of industrial society into a technocracy. Genet relates the experiences of his characters \"to the great political and social upheavals of the twentieth century,\" Goldmann argues, particularly important among which is \"the collapse of the tremendous hopes for revolution.\" He discerns in the play's dramatic structure a balance of three equal movements\u2014\"established order, threat to order, and order again re-established.\" The first section of the play dramatises the way in which the prestigious images of the established order\u2014the Bishop, the Judge, the General\u2014belie the actual bearers of power in modern society:\n\nGenet employs the image of a house of ilusions, a brothel, in which, it must however be recalled, sexuality plays almost no role, and in which we are principally shown the desire for power...The first scenes show us three typical specimens...What is common to their three dreams is that, contrary to what we will later see to be the social reality, they still confuse prestige with power and identify one with the other.\nIrma and the Chief of Police \"possess the real power,\" Goldmann points out; they \"represent the two essential aspects of technocracy: the organization of an enterprise and the power of the State.\" Consequently, the Chief of Police's dilemma dramatises the historical process of \"the growth in prestige of the technicians of repression in the consciousness of the great masses of people.\"\nThe subject of the play is the transformation by means of which \"the Chief of Police comes to be part of the fantasies of power of the people who do not possess it.\" This process is borne by Roger, the revolutionary leader whose downfall forms part of the third section:\n\nRoger the plumber comes to the house of illusions\u2014like those who earlier had dreamed of being Judge, Bishop or General\u2014to live out for a few hours his dream of being a technician of power. Yet by doing that, Genet tells us, the revolutionary who dreams of being Chief of Police castrates himself as a revolutionary.\nTo the extent that \"realism\" is understood as \"the effort to bring to light the essential relationships that at a particular moment govern both the development of the whole of social relations and\u2014through the latter\u2014the development of individual destinies and the psychological life of individuals,\" Goldmann argues that The Balcony has a realist structure and characterises Genet as \"a very great realist author\":\nOne may disagree with the lack of hope that prevails in Genet's play. But it would be difficult to deny that it is perfectly realistic insofar as it transposes onto the literary level the fundamental transformations that modern society has undergone over the past forty years, and also that it does this in a particularly clear and comprehensible manner.\nWhile Goldmann detects an \"extremely strong\" Brechtian influence in The Balcony, Carol Rosen characterises Genet's dramaturgy as \"Artaudian.\" \"Just as Mme. Irma's brothel is the intangible shadow of a real social phenomenon,\" she suggests, \"her closet dramas are the Artaudian double of their impotent bases in truth.\" Rosen reads Irma's brothel as \"a metaphysical construct in a discussion play about the value of mimetic ritual, the transcendence possible in play, and the |magical efficacy of the theater itself\"; it is \"more than a naturalistically ordered stage brothel; it is more than real; it expresses conflicting ideas with the erotic nuances of a dream.\" In line with Genet's interest in Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy (1872), Rosen aligns the development of Irma's relationship to the audience with the mythic narrative of Dionysos toying with Pentheus in Euripides' tragedy The Bacchae (405 BCE). In contrast to Goldmann's analysis of the play as an epic defamiliarisation of the historical rise of technocracy, Rosen sees The Balcony as a theatre of cruelty staging of \"a mythic dimension to the dark side of the human soul.\" Like Goldmann, J. L. Styan, too, detects the influence of Brechtian defamiliarisation in the play, which he reads as a \"political examination of how man chooses his role in society.\" Styan argues that\u2014despite the symbolism of evil and the sensational, emotionally disturbing staging of the secret desires of its audience\u2014there is in Genet's theatre \"a sharp intellectual edge, a shocking clear-headedness\" that \"links him more with Pirandello than with Artaud.\"Genet's theatre, the editors of Jean Genet: Performance and Politics argue, stages an interrogation and deconstruction of \"the value and status of the theatrical frame itself.\" Postmodern performance, though, provides the most appropriate frame of reference for understanding it, they suggest. They observe that, in common with his other late dramas, The Blacks (1959) and The Screens (1964), The Balcony's exploration of explosive political issues appears to contradict its author's calls for a \"non-historical, mythical stage.\" They interpret The Balcony as an examination of \"how revolutions are appropriated through mass-media manipulation.\" Taking their cue from Genet's note on the play from 1960, they conclude that Genet felt that \"conventional political theatre too often indulges the spectator by depicting the revolution as having already happened. Instead of encouraging the audience to change the world, it acts as a safety valve, and thus works to support the status quo.\" His is a form of political theatre that is \"neither didactic nor based on realism\"; instead, it fuses the metaphysical or sacred and the political and constitutes the most successful articulation to date of \"post-modernist performance and Brechtian critical theatre.\" It \"shows us that performance is not divorced from reality,\" they suggest, but rather that it is \"productive of reality.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26859", "text": "In November 1961, Genet met the American film director Joseph Strick, with whom he agreed to a cinematic adaption of the play.

Folsey for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography and for Ben Maddow for a Writers Guild of America Award.\nRobert DiDomenica composed an operatic version of the play in 1972, though it did not receive its premi\u00e8re until Sarah Caldwell of the Opera Company of Boston produced it in 1990. Having seen the New York production of the play in 1960, DiDomenica based his libretto on Bernard Frechtman's revised translation of 1966, though he did not acquire the rights to do so until shortly before Genet's death, in 1986.

With a fellow club-member, E. Wesson Woodbury, he decides to travel west into the Canadian wilderness for a vacation of fishing and canoeing. Woodbury has made the arrangements, and all that Prescott need do is show up.\nTravelling by train through Winnipeg, the duo make their way to the Flambeau River, then to the former logging town of Whitewater. Although Prescott impresses his travelling companion with his handling of a surly innkeeper, the two are already finding themselves to be incompatible. Woodbury chides Prescott over his decision, for example, to carry a pillow in his gear.\nTaking the steamer Emily C. Just upriver to their departure point, Prescott and Woodbury finally set out with their native guides / canoe men, but tensions between them grow and tempers fray. After several misadventures in both canoeing and camping, they are openly hostile to one another. It is at this point that they encounter Joe Easter, of the Easter Trading Company. Ralph elects to abandon Woodbury and accept Easter's invitation to stay with him at his place further up the Mantrap River, at the small trading post of Mantrap Landing. Easter and Prescott travel with Lawrence Jackfish, Easter's native factotum, and upon arriving meet McGavity, Easter's dour Scottish competitor in trade, and Easter's wife, Alverna, a former manicurist from the Hotel Ranleagh in Minneapolis, Minnesota, who Easter met while in town and married the next day.\nIn the ensuing days, Alverna's discontent with the limited social sphere of Mantrap Landing in general, and with Joe Easter in particular, becomes apparent. While tensions are on the rise with the indigenous Cree tribes who also inhabit the area, due to a suspension of their credit with the trading posts, tensions also grow with the introduction of Ralph Prescott to the local social dynamic. Prescott has little experience of women and is a bachelor, and soon he falls for Alverna's charms, but is simultaneously repulsed by the thought of betraying Joe Easter, whom he considers a friend. On reflection, Prescott also feels guilty at abandoning E. Wesson Woodbury, and is several times on the verge of deciding to depart to find him. Finally, after a meeting with the Cree at which the traders make their case for having their bills paid in order to restore the Cree's credit, only to be met with derision, Prescott leaves Mantrap Landing. Lawrence Jackfish pilots him, but they do not get far before Alverna catches up to the canoe and demands that Prescott take her with him. Suffering with a mixture of misgivings over betraying Joe Easter and his inconstant love for Alverna, Prescott agrees.\nThe route they have taken, however, is longer and harder than anticipated, and as their supplies dwindle, Prescott and Alverna awaken to discover that Lawrence Jackfish has taken most of the supplies and the canoe. As they attempt to continue on foot, they flag down a hydroplane carrying firefighters to battle a nearby wildfire, but the plane cannot carry them. Instead, it drops a few supplies with which they attempt to continue their journey. However, shortly thereafter Joe Easter catches them up, and Prescott meditates on the idea of shooting him outright, but does not. Easter has come not to reclaim Alverna and punish Prescott, but to save Prescott from the mistake that he himself made, of becoming involved with Alverna. Easter goes on to explain that his stocks and warehouse have been destroyed by a fire set by the Cree in reprisal for the traders having cut off their credit: he is now broke and without resources or home (the fate of the others at Mantrap Landing is unclear). Easter wants to make a new start in Winnipeg, and even entertains the idea of travelling with Ralph Prescott to New York to try his luck there. Faced with a choice of whom to take home with him, Prescott chooses Easter, to Alverna's disgust.\nAfter escaping the forest fire together, the three make their way to Winnipeg, where Alverna is put on a train for Minneapolis.

Although piracy is a chronic problem in Silesia, the Royal Navy managed to keep it somewhat in check until the war began; with the fleet needed elsewhere piracy has gone completely out of control and the powerful Manticoran merchant cartels demand that the Navy do something. There are other considerations: Silesia is something of a disputed territory between the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the Andermani Empire.\nWhile Honor leads her crew in battles against various pirates, the Havenites are also conducting covert commerce raiding in Silesia, in an attempt to destabilize Manticoran trade in the region and present themselves in a more favorable light to the Andermani.\nThe Havenite light cruiser PNS Vaubon, under Citizen Commander Warner Caslet, had been pursuing a particularly loathsome group of raiders whose actions were repugnant to most of the Havenite officers involved.

The Reseune authorities have Ari legally recognized as Emory's clone, entitled to take possession of her predecessor's property, in order to block the release of potentially damaging information. Denys is forced to reveal to his young ward who she is and how much her life has been manipulated.\nBecause of deep Administration suspicion of his loyalties, Justin is warned to stay away from Ari. However, he cannot avoid bumping into her from time to time as she grows up. She comes to like him and appreciate his skills, particularly since his interests lie in her own area of research. Soon after she gains adult status, she has Justin and Grant transferred to her new department. However, when the sixteen-year-old makes a pass at him, she is shocked by his strong reaction. Justin is forced to reveal the reason. Ari discovers that Emory's rape of Justin had not just been for sex, but also a major \"intervention\" to free him from his father's domination, so he could work for Emory; it was left unfinished when she died. The younger Ari repairs the damage as best she can.\nAri also comes to terms with the fact that she is much like her predecessor; it is sometimes hard to know where Emory's memories stop and Ari's start. She takes up the original's ultra-secret agenda, revealed to her by Base One, her guiding computer program, and unknown to anyone else. Emory had undertaken to restructure Union society to, in her view, save it from eventual collapse.\nGiraud Nye had taken over Emory's seat in the Council of Nine after her death. A major political crisis is precipitated by his death from old age, as well as the Paxers \u2013 a terrorist group \u2013 manipulating Jordan. An attempt on Ari's life is barely foiled when Justin's just-in-time warning enables Florian and Catlin to deal with an unexpected would-be assassin.

He was given regular blood tests to ensure that he was not suffering liver damage. The darkening of his skin was not perfect, so he touched it up with stain. He shaved his head bald to hide his straight brown hair. Satisfied that he could pass as an African-American, Griffin began a six-week journey in the South. Don Rutledge traveled with him, documenting the experience with photos.During his trip, Griffin abided by the rule that he would not change his name or alter his identity; if asked who he was or what he was doing, he would tell the truth. In the beginning, he decided to talk as little as possible to ease his transition into the social milieu of southern U.S. blacks. He became accustomed everywhere to the \"hate stare\" received from whites.\nAfter he disguised himself, many people who knew Griffin as a white man did not recognize him. Sterling Williams, a black shoeshine man in the French Quarter whom Griffin regarded as a casual friend, did not recognize him. He first hinted that he wore the same unusual shoes as somebody else, but Sterling still did not recognize him until Griffin told him. Because Griffin wanted assistance in entering into the black community, he decided to tell Williams about his identity and project.\nIn New Orleans, a black counterman at a small restaurant chatted with Griffin about the difficulties of finding a place to go to the bathroom, as facilities were segregated and blacks were prohibited from many. He turned a question about a Catholic church into a joke about \"spending much of your time praying for a place to piss\".\nOn a bus trip, Griffin began to give his seat to a white woman, but disapproving looks from black passengers stopped him. He thought he had a momentary breakthrough with the woman, but she insulted him and began talking with other white passengers about how impudent the blacks were becoming.\nGriffin decided to end his journey in late November in Montgomery, Alabama.

Marina Thwaite is the daughter of a revered literary critic and author Murray Thwaite and his wife Annabel. Years earlier, Marina secured a contract to write a book about children's fashion, and having used up all her advance money and facing a hard deadline, moves back into her childhood home with her parents. Meanwhile, Julius Clarke, a brilliant and witty critic for The Village Voice, cannot sustain himself with his literary work and is forced to take temporary jobs to supplement his income\u2014which he finds demeaning. At one of his temp jobs, he meets a successful, slightly younger man David Cohen. Julius seduces him and eventually moves in with him and allows himself to be kept like a housewife. He keeps Marina and Danielle away from David.\nMeanwhile, Danielle begins two flirtations, one with Ludovic Seeley, an Australian editor who has moved to New York City to start a literary journal The Monitor (named after Le Moniteur Universel) and another with Marina's father Murray, who begins an email correspondence at first using her job and later concern over Marina's unemployment as reasons to keep contacting her.\nMarina, still hanging on to the last traces of her It-girl status, is unsettled by the arrival of her 19-year-old cousin Bootie, who has dropped out of university to pursue a program of educating himself by his own design. Bootie reveres the Thwaites and looks up to his uncle Murray, in whose footsteps he wants to follow; but Marina is dismissive, calling him \"Fat Fredrick\". She finds how he has installed himself in the Thwaite home creepy. Despite this, things quickly fall in line for Bootie: Murray is impressed by both his desire to leave his small town and his desire to self-educate. Murray offers him a salary and work as his private secretary. Through Marina, Bootie also is able to rent Julius's old apartment.\nThough Danielle is more attracted to Seeley, she makes the mistake of introducing him to Marina as a possible editor for his magazine. Danielle watches from the sidelines as Seeley and Marina begin to work together and start a relationship. Seeley also inspires Marina to begin to work on her book anew, which she decides to name The Emperor's Children Have No Clothes, inspired by something that Seeley tells her. As the possibility of being with Seeley dissolves, Danielle begins sleeping with Murray.\nWorking as Murray's secretary, Bootie discovers that his uncle is not the high-principled man he once thought he was and discovers that he self-plagiarizes articles, dismisses low-paying events for star-studded ones and is writing a secret indulgent book, How to Live. Additionally, after discovering Murray's affair with Danielle, Bootie decides to write an expos\u00e9 on Murray for The Monitor.\nOver the 4th of July holiday weekend, Seeley and Marina become engaged, to the annoyance of Danielle and Murray, both of whom suspect that Seeley has some ulterior motive to take down Murray. Around the same time, Marina finishes her book and gives it to Murray to read. Finding it vapid and soulless, he urges her not to publish it, causing a rift between father and daughter. Around the same time, Bootie finishes his expos\u00e9 on Murray and gives copies to his mother, Marina and Murray. Expecting them to applaud him for his honesty, he is shocked when all three are horrified by what he has written. Making matters worse, Seeley likes the piece and wants to publish it, causing a fight between him and Marina.\nBootie becomes estranged from the Thwaites. Furthermore, after David loses his job, Julius takes back his apartment, causing Bootie to move to rent a room in an apartment and begin temping downtown.\nMarina goes forward with publishing her book and marrying Seeley. At their wedding, Danielle asks Murray to spend an entire night with her, something he has never done, always returning home after their trysts to his wife, Annabel. Murray has a cancellation on September 10 and thus decides to spend that night with Danielle. They spend the evening together, and the following morning are able to see the September 11 attacks from Danielle's apartment window. Terrified about what has happened, Murray abandons Danielle to go to Annabel. Danielle is heartbroken, realizing that though she thought of Murray as her soulmate, he has chosen Annabel over her. At the headquarters of The Monitor, Seeley realizes that his project is completely doomed as the launch was to take place that day, but the attacks mean that the magazine cannot go to print, and that all the articles will seem obsolete anyway. Bootie's mother Judy waits to hear from her son and becomes disconcerted as days pass and she hears nothing. She enlists the Thwaites to help find her son, and though they manage to track down the temp agency where he worked, they are unable to locate him and assume he has died.\nIn a state of shock over her breakup, Danielle contacts her mother, who takes her on a vacation to Miami.

Monstrous Regiment was nominated for a Locus Award in 2004.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_26963", "text": "The bulk of Monstrous Regiment takes place in the small, bellicose country of Borogravia, a highly conservative nation, whose people live according to the increasingly strange (and harmful) decrees of its favored deity, Nuggan. The main feature of his religion is the Abominations; a long, often-updated list of banned things. These things include garlic, cats, the smell of beets, people with ginger hair, shirts with six buttons, anyone shorter than three feet (namely dwarves, children and babies), sneezing, jigsaw puzzles, chocolate (which was once Borogravia's staple export, plunging the country into increasing poverty), crop rotation (which denigrated Borogravia's food supplies), and the colour blue.\nThe list of \"Abominations Unto Nuggan\" often causes conflicts with Borogravia's neighbours, with uncertainty over the whereabouts of Nuggan and how to lead moral lives leading the inhabitants of Borogravia to deify their Duchess, to whom they pray instead as the traditional head of the Nugganitic church. This slowly causes problems as, on the Discworld, belief grants power. Borogravia is in the midst of a war against an alliance of neighbouring countries, caused by a border dispute with the country of Zlobenia. Other factors include Prince Heinrich of Zlobenia's claim to the Borogravian throne (who believes that his aunt, the long-unseen Duchess, is dead), and Ankh-Morpork's diplomatic involvement following the destruction of Clacks towers by Borogravia. Rumour is that the war is going poorly for Borogravia, though the country's leadership (and \"everyone\") denies it.\nPolly Perks's brother Paul is missing in action after fighting in the Borogravian army. Paul is naive and believes what he is told regardless of the credibility or political leanings of the source, and even though Polly is more qualified to take over the family business (a famous pub known as \"The Duchess\"), according to Nugganitic law, women cannot own property, so if Paul does not return the pub will be lost to their drunken cousin when their father dies. Partly to ensure her own future but mainly to ascertain whether Paul is alive, Polly sets off to join the army in order to find him. Women joining the army are regarded as an Abomination Unto Nuggan, so Polly decides to dress up as a man (another Abomination) and enlists as Private Oliver Perks (taking her name from the folk song \"Sweet Polly Oliver\"), a song that her father sang to her when she was a young girl.\nWhile signing up, Polly encounters the repulsively patriotic Corporal Strappi, and the corpulent Sergeant Jackrum. Despite her apprehensions regarding Strappi, she kisses the Duchess \u2013 that is, she kisses a painting of said noble \u2013 and by doing so, joins up. Due to the shortage of troops, her fellow soldiers include a vampire named Maladict, a troll named Carborundum, and an Igor named Igor. They also include \"Tonker\" Halter, \"Shufti\" Manickle, \"Wazzer\" Goom, and \"Lofty\" Tewt.\nThat night, Polly encounters an unknown supporter whilst answering a call of nature, who assures her that although they know that Polly is a girl, they won't give her away. They also give her some hints on how not to be discovered. Over the next few days, Polly makes a startling discovery: Lofty is also a girl. Since Lofty and Tonker are always together, Polly assumes that Lofty joined the army to follow her man, just like in \"Sweet Polly Oliver\". Later, she finds out that Shufti is another girl, and a pregnant one. She also joined the army to find her man; in this case, the father of her child, who she'd only known for a few days, and is known as Johnny.\nGradually, Polly discovers not only that everyone in her regiment is female, but also receives confirmation of Borogravia's bleak situation. Most of her country's forces are captured or on the run, and food supplies are limited. This point is driven home when Igor (actually Igorina) demonstrates her surgery talents and saves several lives among a group of badly injured fleeing soldiers.\nThe regiment, under the leadership of their inexperienced commanding officer Lieutenant Blouse, makes its way toward the Keep where the enemy is based. Meanwhile, thanks to a chance encounter where the regiment unknowingly subdue and humiliate an elite Zlobenian detachment, including Prince Heinrich, their exploits become known to the outside world through William de Worde and his newspaper, The Ankh-Morpork Times. Their progress particularly piques the interest of Commander Vimes, who is stationed as a special envoy with the alliance at the Keep. Vimes has his officers keep track of the regiment, occasionally secretly providing aid. As a result of Maladict suffering from caffeine withdrawal following the loss of his coffee-making equipment, he and other members of the regiment experience 'flashsides' to Earth's Vietnam War.\nPolly and most of the regiment are able to infiltrate the Keep, disguising themselves as washerwomen, and once inside plot to release the captured Borogravian troops. They manage to do so, and Borogravia is able to retake much of the Keep, but when Polly admits they are women, their own forces remove them from the conflict and they are brought in front of a council of senior officers, where their fate will be decided. With the council about to discharge them and force them to return home, Jackrum barges in and intervenes, revealing that a third of the military's top officers (including Chief of the General Staff General Froc) are actually women as well. But in the midst of this revelation, the Duchess, now raised to the level of a small deity by Borogravians' belief, takes brief possession of Wazzer, her most passionate believer. The Duchess urges all of the generals to quit the war and return home, to repair their country, returning their kiss of service, and ending their obligation to her. It is revealed that Nuggan is now dead, being reduced to a whisper, with the new Abominations (the last being rocks, ears and accordion players) being produced by the collective anxiety of his 'worshippers'.\nIn a private moment with Jackrum, Polly reveals to her Sergeant that she now knows him to (physically) be a woman and persuades Jackrum to go to the home of his grown son William and reveal himself as William's long-lost father. The regiment is sent to the enemy and successfully negotiates a truce, and military rules are changed so that women are allowed to serve openly and Maladict reveals himself as really being Maladicta. Polly finds her brother alive and well and they return home to the Duchess with Shufti, who joins Polly in her refusal to be subjugated on the basis of her gender and marital status. The other members of the regiment go on to lives that they would not have been able to consider before their emancipation, such as Igorina opening a women's clinic on the basis that many women would prefer to see a female practitioner.\nSometime later, despite the peace they had desperately fought for, conflict breaks out again. Polly, having received correspondence from Sgt Jackrum, leaves the tavern to seek new ways to fight a war using the influence she gained and finds herself in the role of commander of boy-impersonating young women who are marching off to war, reuniting with Maladicta.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26964", "text": "Borogravians\n\nGrand Duchess Annagovia\nGeneral Froc\nMajor Clogston\nLieutenant Blouse (of the Tenth Infantry)\nPrivate Lart Hubukurk the younger\nPrivate Joe Hubukurk the elder (retired)\nSergeant-Major Jack Jackrum\nCorporal Strappi\nPolly Perks\nIgor\nMaladict\nCarborundum\n\"Tonker\" Halter\n\"Shufti\" Manickle\n\"Wazzer\" Goom\n\"Lofty\" Tewt\nEnidZlobenians and other neighboring countries\n\nPrince HeinrichAnkh-Morporkians\n\nSamuel Vimes (of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch)\nAngua von \u00dcberwald\nBuggy Swires\nReg Shoe\nClarence Chinny (Consul to Zlobenia)\nWilliam de Worde (of the Ankh-Morpork Times)\nOtto Chriek (of the Ankh-Morpork Times)\nRonald Rust", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_26965", "text": "The New York Times felt that Monstrous Regiment \"had serious heft\", comparing Pratchett's depiction of \"the pity of war\" to Wilfred Owen.

The Justice League comes to investigate Barda's murder. Dr. Mid-Nite performs an autopsy which doesn't reveal how she was killed. Mr. Miracle contemplates using the Anti-Life Equation to bring his wife back, but stops himself. He receives an urgent summons back to New Genesis. Superman and Mr. Miracle bring Barda's body back to New Genesis. Darkseid asks Desaad to investigate these murders by having him examine Justeen, who was also murdered. Superman and Mr. Miracle arrive on New Genesis. Orion is insulted by Superman's presence and attacks him. Metron arrives and reveals what the cause of death is to all the New Gods. Darkseid has also come to the same conclusion: their souls have been taken from them.

It attempted to reunite with its darker part, but was delayed by the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, which unified alternative realities and created an impenetrable Source Wall. The Source then orchestrated the events of Infinite Crisis, apparently subtly manipulating Alexander Luthor, and later the events of 52 to bring back the Multiverse, and freeing its dark half, which had taken the form of the Anti-Life Entity. The Source thus reveals that it is now using an agent to eliminate the Fourth World in order to bring about the Fifth World, which will be perfect. The Source agrees to Metron's request that he be allowed to witness the end of the Fourth World.\nThe reunited Source reveals how Miracle's beliefs were not of its doing.

Dan is infatuated with Anna, though he is in a relationship with Alice, for whom he left his former girlfriend. He begs Anna to see him again, and she rejects him.

Subtitled A New Rendering of the Watson Legend, it is a semi-fictional account of the life of Scottish-American Edgar \"Bloody\" Watson (1855\u20131910), a real Florida sugar cane planter and alleged outlaw who was killed by a posse of his neighbors in the remote Ten Thousand Islands region of southwest Florida.\nMatthiessen revised, condensed, and combined his three previously published novels about Edgar Watson to create this single-volume novel, which is divided into three sections that conform to the three original books. Shadow Country won the National Book Award for Fiction in 2008\nand the William Dean Howells Medal in 2010.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_26984", "text": "Shadow Country is a reworked, re-edited, and retitled single-volume version of a trilogy published in the 1990s. The three parts of this book correspond to the three original novels: Killing Mr. Watson (1990), Lost Man's River (1997), and Bone By Bone (1999).\nMatthiesen's original intention was to produce a single long novel, but his publisher balked at the length of the manuscript and published it as three separate books. Matthiessen was not entirely satisfied with the resulting works and continued to refine his original manuscript off and on for the next several years. The eventual publication of Shadow Country involved substantial editing and culling: while the three separately published books together numbered some 1,300 pages, Shadow Country would number around 900. Most of the cuts came from Lost Man's River.\nBook One is based on Killing Mr. Watson and is a collection of first-person narrative accounts of Edgar \"Bloody\" Watson's rise to power and eventual death at the hands of his neighbors. The book opens with Watson's death - his shooting by a local posse on the shores of Chokoloskee Island behind the Ted Smallwood Store. The rest of the book pieces together first-person accounts of 12 characters who recount the story from Watson's arrival in the Ten Thousand Islands in the early 1890s until his demise in 1910. Many of the \"characters\" who tell the story are based on real people who lived in the area at the time.\nBook Two is based on Lost Man's River. It is set several years after Book One, and it tells the story of Lucius, one of Watson's sons and an alcoholic historian, who tries to reconstruct his father's life in an attempt to determine whether he was really a murderer and an outlaw. It is written as a third person narrative.\nBook Three is based on Bone By Bone. In this first-person section, Edgar Watson tells his own life story, from his childhood in South Carolina to his fatal encounter with his neighbors on the edge of the Florida Everglades.

This magnificent, sad masterpiece about race, history, and defeated dreams can easily stand comparison with Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men. Little wonder, too, that parts of the story of E.J. Watson call up comparisons with Dostoevsky, Conrad, and, inevitably, Faulkner. In every way, Shadow Country is a bravura performance, at once history, fiction, and myth\u2014as well as the capstone to the career of one of the most admired and admirable writers of our time.\nTom LeClair, reviewing the work for the New York Times, considered that the work failed to live up to the sum total of its originally published parts, stating:\n\nBy reducing his Watson materials to one volume, Matthiessen has sacrificed qualities that gave those novels their powerful reinforcing illusions of authenticity and artlessness. Book I still has that Ten Thousand Islands quality, but \"Shadow Country\" as a whole is like the Tamiami Trail that crosses the Everglades. It offers a quicker and easier passage through the swamp, but fewer shades and shadows.\nTampa Bay Times book editor Colette Bancroft praised the book's wider theme and context:\n\nMatthiessen is writing about one man's life in Shadow Country, but he is also writing about the life of the nation over the course of half a century. Watson's story is essentially the story of the American frontier, of the conquering of wild lands and people, and of what such empires cost. Most of the book is set in frontier Florida, a Florida virtually unimaginable in our air-conditioned, subdivided century. It is a brutally beautiful wilderness where, just 100 years ago, panthers and red wolves stalked the woods, plume hunters made fortunes wiping out whole species of birds and men like Watson made their own law.\nShadow Country takes us there in unforgettable fashion.

{"id": "50_400", "question": "Who is the author of The Anxiety of Influence?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27000", "text": "The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry is a 1973 book by Harold Bloom on the anxiety of influence in writing poetry. It was the first in a series of books that advanced a new \"revisionary\" or antithetical approach to literary criticism. Bloom's central thesis is that poets are hindered in their creative process by the ambiguous relationship they necessarily maintain with precursor poets. While admitting the influence of extraliterary experience on every poet, he argues that \"the poet in a poet\" is inspired to write by reading another poet's poetry and will tend to produce work that is in danger of being derivative of existing poetry, and, therefore, weak. Because poets historically emphasize an original poetic vision in order to guarantee their survival into posterity, the influence of precursor poets inspires a sense of anxiety in living poets. Thus Bloom attempts to work out the process by which the small minority of 'strong' poets manage to create original work in spite of the pressure of influence. Such an agon (a vain attempt by a writer to resolve the conflict between his ideas and those of a much more influential predecessor), Bloom argues, depends on six revisionary ratios, which reflect Freudian and quasi-Freudian defense mechanisms, as well as the tropes of classical rhetoric.\nBefore writing this book, Bloom spent a decade studying the Romantic poets of the early nineteenth century. This is reflected in the emphasis given to those poets and their struggle with the influence of John Milton, Robert Burns, and Edmund Spenser. Other poets analyzed range from Lucretius and Dante to Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and John Ashbery. In The Anxiety of Influence and other early books, Bloom claimed that influence was particularly important for post-enlightenment poets. Conversely, he suggested that influence might have been less of a problem for such poets as Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Bloom later changed his mind, and the most recent editions of The Anxiety of Influence include a preface claiming that Shakespeare was troubled early in his career by the influence of Christopher Marlowe. The book itself is divided into six major categories, called \"six revisionary ratios\" by Bloom.  They are clinamen, tessera, kenosis, daemonization, askesis, and apophrades.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27001", "text": "Bloom introduces his six revisionary ratios in the following manner, which he consistently applies in this book as well as his successor volume titled A Map of Misreading.\n\nClinamen \u2013 Bloom defines this as \"poetic misreading or misprision proper\". The poet makes a swerve away from the precursor in the form of a \"corrective movement\". This swerve suggests that the precursor \"went accurately up to a certain point\", but should have swerved in the direction that the new poem moves. Bloom took the word clinamen from Lucretius, who refers to swerves of atoms that make change possible.\nTessera \u2013 Bloom defines this as \"completion and antithesis\". The author \"completes\" his precursor's work, retaining its terms but meaning them in a new sense, \"as though the precursor had failed to go far enough\". The word tessera refers to a fragment that, together with other fragments, reconstitutes the whole; Bloom is referring to ancient mystery cults, who would use tessera as tokens of recognition.\nKenosis \u2013 Bloom defines this as a \"breaking device similar to the defence mechanisms our psyches employ against repetition compulsions\", in other words \"a movement toward discontinuity with the precursor\". The poet humbles himself, \"as though he were ceasing to be a poet\", but does so in such a way as to empty out the precursor poem too, so that the later poet is not deflated as much as may seem. Bloom took the word kenosis from St. Paul, who uses it to refer to Jesus accepting his own reduction from divine to human status.\nDaemonization \u2013 Bloom defines this as a \"movement towards a personalized Counter-Sublime, in reaction to the precursor\u2019s Sublime\". The author suggests that the powers in the precursor poem actually derive from something beyond it; the poet does so \"to generalize away the uniqueness of the earlier work\". Bloom took the term daemonization from Neoplatonism, where it refers to an adept being aided by an intermediary, who is neither divine nor human.\nAskesis \u2013 Bloom defines this as a \"movement of self-purgation which intends the attainment of a state of solitude\". The author curtails the impression of his/her own \"human and imaginative endowment\" in order to separate themselves from others and stress his/her own individuality. The poet does this in such a way as to do the same to the precursor, whose limitations and individuality are also emphasized, separating him/her from the later poet. Bloom took the word askesis (asceticism) from the pre-Socratic philosophers.\nApophrades \u2013 Bloom defines this as the \u201creturn of the dead\u201d. The poet, toward the end of his/her life, opens up his poem \u2013 this time deliberately rather than naturally \u2013 to the precursor's influence. But this deliberateness creates the uncanny effect that the precursor's work seems to be derivative of the later poet. Bloom took the word apophrades from the Athenian concept of the days on which the dead return to reinhabit the houses in which they once lived.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Her mother fell ill while pregnant with Agnes and vowed to send Agnes to the convent if she delivered her safely. She is a virtuous young lady who intends to marry Don Raymond but her parents want her to become a nun, so she decides to run away with him. Their plans are foiled and, thinking Don Raymond has abandoned her forever, she enters the convent.\nAmbrosio is an extremely devout monk about 30 years old. He was found left at the Abbey doorstep when he was too young to tell his tale. The monks consider him a present from the Virgin Mary and they educate him at the monastery.\nAntonia is a timid and innocent girl of 15. She was brought up in an old castle in Murcia with only her mother Elvira and is therefore very sheltered. She is the object of Don Lorenzo's attentions. The novel's evil characters are considered to be better written than the virtuous ones, and Antonia's character is so virtuous that some have found her \"deadly dull\".\nElvira is the mother of Antonia and Ambrosio. She married a young nobleman in secret. His family does not approve of her and because of this she and her husband escape to the Indies, leaving her 2-year-old son behind. After 13 years, when Antonia is very young, her husband dies and she returns to Murcia where she lives on an allowance given to her by her father-in-law.\nLeonella is Elvira's sister and Antonia's spinster aunt. She takes an immediate dislike to Ambrosio after hearing his sermon. She believes Don Christoval's polite attentions are more significant than they actually are and is hurt when he fails to call at her house. She eventually marries a younger man and lives in Cordova.\nDon Lorenzo de Medina is Agnes's older brother and friend of Don Raymond and Don Christoval. Immediately intrigued by Antonia after meeting her at Ambrosio's sermon, Don Lorenzo resolves to marry her.\nMatilda is first known as Rosario, the young boy who looks up to Ambrosio \"with a respect approaching idolatry\". Rosario is brought to the Monastery by a well dressed rich stranger but not much more is known of his past. He always hides under his cowl and later reveals that he is actually Matilda, a beautiful young lady who loves Ambrosio. Matilda 'loved' Ambrosio even before she joined the monastery (as a boy), and therefore requested a painting of herself as Madonna to be given to Ambrosio, which hangs in his room. She seduces Ambrosio and aids in his destruction of Antonia with magic. The character of Matilda was highly praised by Coleridge as Lewis's masterpiece, and is said to be \"exquisitely imagined\" and \"superior in wickedness to the most wicked of men.\" Though she is considered by some critics to be the most intelligent, articulate, and interesting, she is difficult to characterise. The plot of the novel relies on her being a supernatural force with magical powers, but she begins as a human. She tells Ambrosio she loves him when she thinks he is asleep and cries \"involuntary\" tears when she realises he no longer cares for her. These passages, together with the haste in which the novel was written, seem to indicate \"that Lewis changed his mind in the course of the narrative\".\nThe Prioress, also known as Mother St. Agatha, punishes Agnes severely to uphold the honour of the convent of St. Clare. \"Viciously cruel in the name of virtue\", she keeps Agnes prisoner in the dungeons beneath the convent with only enough bread and water to sustain her but not nourish her. The prioress circulates the story of Agnes's death to everyone, including Agnes's own relations. She is beaten to a bloody pulp by the crowd that gathers to honour St. Clare when they realise she is responsible for Agnes's supposed death. She is also the inspiration for the Abbess of San Stephano in Radcliffe's The Italian.\nDon Raymond is the son of a Marquis and is also known as Alphonso d'Alvarada. He takes the name Alphonso when his father, by the urging of his friend the Duke of Villa Hermosa, advises him that taking a new name will allow him to be known for his merits rather than his rank. He travels to Paris, but finds the Parisians \"frivolous, unfeeling and insincere\" and sets out for Germany. Near Strasbourg he is forced to seek accommodations in a cottage after his chaise supposedly breaks down. He is the target of the robber Baptiste but with help from Baptiste's wife Marguerite, Raymond is able to save himself and the Baroness Lindenberg. Grateful, the Baroness invites Don Raymond to stay with her and her husband at their castle in Bavaria.\nDonna Rodolpha, Baroness of Lindenburg meets Don Raymond while travelling to Strasbourg. She is in love with Don Raymond and becomes jealous when she finds out Don Raymond is in love with her niece, Agnes.  She asks him to leave the Castle of Lindenberg and later speaks poorly of his character.\nMother St. Ursula assists in Agnes's rescue. She is a witness to the Prioress's crimes and without her, Don Lorenzo would not be able to accuse the Prioress.\nTheodore is Don Raymond's page. He enjoys writing poetry and authors the poems \"Love and Age\" and \"The Water King\". After reading \"Love and Age\", Don Raymond points out the flaws in the piece, which may be flaws Lewis noticed in his own work. Far from being the unwaiveringly faithful servant stock character, Theodore plays a key role in moving the plot forward by helping with Don Raymond's plans to escape with Agnes. Theodore's character also provides foreshadowing through his poems. His poems parallel the action of the story. For instance, in his poem \"The Water King\", the lovely maid's fate foreshadows Antonia's. In addition, Theodore also bears a striking resemblance to other characters in other of Lewis's works, including Leolyn in One O'clock (1811) and Eugene in \"Mistrust\" from Romantic Tales (1808).\nVirginia de Villa Franca, introduced late in the story, is a beautiful, virtuous young relation of the Prioress who represents St. Clare in the Procession. Virginia nurses the ill Agnes back to health and thus wins Lorenzo's affections.

He acknowledges that it is \"the offspring of no common genius,\" that the \"underplot... is skilfully and closely connected with the main story, and is subservient to its development,\" that the story Lewis weaves in about the bleeding nun is \"truly terrific\" and that he cannot recall a \"bolder or more happy conception than that of the burning cross on the forehead of the wandering Jew.\" Coleridge gives his highest praise to the character of Matilda, who he believes is \"the author's master-piece. It is, indeed, exquisitely imagined, and as exquisitely supported. The whole work is distinguished by the variety and impressiveness of its incidents; and the author everywhere discovers an imagination rich, powerful, and fervid. Such are the excellencies\" (7). Coleridge continues by saying that \"the errors and defects are more numerous, and (we are sorry to add) of greater importance.\" Because \"the order of nature may be changed whenever the author's purposes demand it\" there are no surprises in the work. Moral truth cannot be gleaned because Ambrosio was destroyed by spiritual beings, and no earthly being can sufficiently oppose the \"power and cunning of supernatural beings.\" Scenes of grotesquery and horror abound, which are a proof of \"a low and vulgar taste.\" The character of Ambrosio is \"impossible... contrary to nature.\" Coleridge argues that the most \"grievous fault... for which no literary excellence can atone\" is that \"our author has contrived to make [tales of enchantments and witchcraft] ' \u2018pernicious' \u2018, by blending, with an irreverent negligence, all that is most awfully true in religion with all that is most ridiculously absurd in superstition,\" commenting with the immortal line that \"the Monk is a romance, which if a parent saw in the hands of a son or daughter, he might reasonably turn pale.\" Coleridge finishes the piece by explaining that he was \"induced to pay particular attention to this work, from the unusual success which it has experienced\" and that \"the author is a man of rank and fortune. Yes! the author of the Monk signs himself a LEGISLATOR! We stare and tremble.\"Thomas James Mathias followed Coleridge's lead in The Pursuits of Literature, a poem in the 18th-Century satiric tradition, but takes a step farther than Coleridge by claiming that a specific passage made the novel indictable under law. The passage, found in Chapter Seven Volume II, discusses an interpretation of the Bible as too lewd for youth to read.\nThese two major pieces led the way for a multitude of other attacks on the novel, from such sources as the Monthly Review, the Monthly Magazine, and the Scots Magazine; the last of these attacked the novel six years after its publication. It was a general trend amongst those who criticised, however, to offer praise of some aspect of the novel. \"It looked,\" writes Andr\u00e9 Parreaux, \"as if every reviewer or critic of the book, no matter how hostile he was, felt compelled to at least pay lip-service to Lewis's genius.\"The criticism of his novel, extending even into criticism of his person, never truly left Lewis, and an attack on his character was published by the Courier posthumously, calling itself a \"just estimate of his character.\" As recorded by MacDonald:  \u201cHe had devoted the first fruits of his mind to the propagation of evil, and the whole long harvest was burnt up ... There is a moral in the life of this man ... He was a reckless defiler of the public mind; a profligate, he cared not how many were to be undone when he drew back the curtain of his profligacy; he had infected his reason with the insolent belief that the power to corrupt made the right, and that conscience might be laughed, so long as he could evade law. The Monk was an eloquent evil; but the man who compounded it knew in his soul that he was compounding poison for the multitude, and in that knowledge he sent it into the world.\u201dThere were those who defended The Monk as well.

Knowing that he is unlikely to survive the violence, Prince Ali Yusuf entrusts his best friend and pilot, Bob Rawlinson, to smuggle a fortune in jewels out of the country. Rawlinson conceals the gems within the hollow of the handle of a tennis racquet belonging to his niece Jennifer, the daughter of his sister Joan, without telling them. Unbeknownst to him, a mysterious woman watches him from the neighbouring balcony.\nThe Prince and Rawlinson die in a plane crash while attempting to flee Ramat. Three months later, Jennifer prepares to attend  Meadowbank School, a prestigious girls' independent school in England. Its staff includes Miss Bulstrode, the school's founder and headmistress; Miss Chadwick, a co-founder of the school and teacher of mathematics; Miss Vansittart, who has taught German at the school for several years; Miss Rich, who has taught English Literature at the school for 18 months; Miss Johnson, the girl's matron; Miss Ang\u00e8le Blanche, the new French teacher; Grace Springer, the new gym teacher; Ann Shapland, Miss Bulstrode's new secretary; and Adam Goodman, a new gardener. As Miss Bulstrode is nearing retirement, she is deciding upon her successor. She believes Miss Chadwick is too old to take over, and is considering both Miss Vansittart, who behaves almost like a second edition of Miss Bulstrode, and Miss Rich, who is young and has many ideas of her own.\nOne night, Miss Chadwick and Miss Johnson notice a light in the sports pavilion and hear a gunshot; upon investigating, they find Miss Springer murdered. When the police begin to investigate, Goodman reveals to Inspector Kelsey, and later to Miss Bulstrode, that he works for British Intelligence. He is at Meadowbank to track down the gems Rawlinson smuggled out, by monitoring Prince Ali Yusuf's cousin, Shaista, who is attending the school. Meanwhile, Jennifer complains to her friend Julia Upjohn that her racquet no longer feels balanced, and they swap racquets. Later, a strange woman approaches Jennifer to present her with a new racquet, claiming it is from Jennifer's Aunt Gina, and takes the old racquet in exchange. However, the sharper Julia finds this suspicious, and Aunt Gina later writes to reveal that she had not sent Jennifer a new racquet. \nThe following weekend, Shaista is kidnapped by someone posing as her uncle's chauffeur. That night, Miss Vansittart is murdered with a sandbag in the Sports Pavilion. After Jennifer and many other students are fetched home by worried parents, Julia investigates the racquet she swapped with Jennifer and finds the smuggled jewels. When someone attempts to enter Julia's room during the night, she quickly flees the school to tell her story to Hercule Poirot, whom she has heard stories about from her Aunt Maureen (Mrs. Summerhayes from Mrs. McGinty's Dead). \nWhile Poirot is at Meadowbank investigating the murders, Miss Blanche is murdered with a sandbag. Interviewing Miss Bulstrode, Poirot learns that Julia's mother, Mrs. Upjohn, who once worked in British counterintelligence during the war, recognized a fellow agent at the school on the first day of term.\nPoirot eventually reveals to all that the Shaista who attended Meadowbank was an imposter; the real Shaista was kidnapped by a group seeking Prince Ali Yusuf's jewels. When the imposter did not find them, the group extracted her from the school before the uncle of the real Shaista could expose her. Poirot briefly focuses attention on Miss Rich as a potential suspect, so he can put the true murderer at ease. He then reveals that Miss Springer was killed because she caught the killer searching for the tennis racquet. Miss Blanche was killed when she attempted to blackmail the killer.\nThrough Mrs. Upjohn, Poirot identifies Ann Shapland as a ruthless espionage agent known as \"Angelica\". Miss Shapland had been in Ramat three months earlier, and was the woman who had witnessed Rawlinson concealing the gems in Jennifer's racquet. Before Miss Shapland is arrested, she attempts to shoot Mrs. Upjohn. As Miss Bulstrode tries to shield Mrs. Upjohn, Miss Chadwick steps in to protect Miss Bulstrode and is fatally wounded. Miss Shapland is disarmed and taken away; Poirot then reveals that the second murder was committed by Miss Chadwick, who was jealous of Miss Vansittart's better qualifications as Mrs. Bulstrode's possible successor. Miss Chadwick came upon Miss Vansittart alone in the Sports Pavilion, and struck her down in a fit of madness.\nIn the aftermath of the investigation, Miss Bulstrode appoints Miss Rich as her partner and successor, with both focusing on rebuilding Meadowbank and its reputation.

However, King Dedelin sends his other daughter Siri to meet the treaty instead.\nVivenna follows her to Hallandren in the hope of saving Siri from her fate. Upon arriving in Hallandren, Vivenna meets with Lemex, one of her father's spies in the city, but he has taken ill and dies shortly thereafter \u2014 though not before bequeathing his large sum of BioChromatic Breath to her (which is considered heretical by the Idrians).\nVivenna joins up with Denth and Tonk Fah, mercenaries that were under Lemex's employ, and together they begin making guerilla attacks against Hallandren's supply depots and convoys that will hopefully give the Idrians an advantage in the seemingly inevitable war.\nSiri, after spending many terrified nights waiting for the God King to procreate with her, finds that he is not actually the menacing, frightening God that she thought, but has actually had his tongue cut out by his priests, making him nothing more than a figurehead. Though he is intelligent, he possesses a childlike outlook because his education was withheld. Siri teaches the God King to communicate by writing, and over time they learn to care for each other and fall in love. However, Siri believes that the priests are secretly plotting to kill her and the God King if she produces an heir, and fears that Hallandren will soon launch a war against Idris. Siri finds a potential ally in the unorthodox god Lightsong, who is plagued by nightmares of war and is struggling to discover his purpose.\nBack in the city, Vivenna discovers that Denth and Tonk Fah are not working for her but against her, having been hired by an unknown third party to instigate the war with Idris, and she barely escapes their custody with her life. After hiding and living destitute in the Idrian slums of Hallandren for weeks, Vivenna is taken in by Vasher, a mysterious man who can use his BioChromatic Breath to Awaken objects, an art at which he is incredibly skilled. He wields a sword called Nightblood, a weapon created in a Biochromatic experiment and which possesses sentience. Together, Vivenna and Vasher work to undo the damage done by Denth and avert the war.\nVivenna convinces Vasher to try and save her sister Siri from the God King's palace. However, Vasher is captured and tortured by Denth, who is revealed to have been working for the God King's Pahn Kahl servants, who are trying to incite war between the Idrians and Hallendren so that they can take the city for themselves.\nThe Pahn Kahl servants capture Siri, kill many of the God King's priests, and throw the God King in the dungeon. Lightsong and many of the other gods are taken captive as well. The Pahn Kahl, having gained the Commands to control the city's undead Lifeless army, send them to attack the Idrians and start the war. However, Lightsong, imprisoned in the dungeon alongside the God King, sacrifices himself by giving the God King his BioChromatic Breath. This heals the king, giving him his tongue back and allowing him access to his godly cache of BioChromatic power. The God King uses his magic to save Siri from the Pahn Kahl servants just as she is about to be murdered. Meanwhile, Vivenna uses her own budding BioChromatic powers to break into the God King's palace and free Vasher, who kills Denth.\nVivenna and Siri are reunited.

The fourth line contains the word \"calkin\", a term for part of a horseshoe, which Kamal is said to have \"turned\", referring to a trick used by horse-mounted brigands of reversing horseshoes to leave misleading tracks. The second quatrain (line 9) has the stock phrase: \"Then up and spoke the Colonel's son that led a troop of the Guides\", which is also found in the Scottish ballad Sir Patrick Spens.

Merton finished the book in 1946 at the age of 31, five years after entering Gethsemani Abbey near Bardstown, Kentucky. The title refers to the mountain of purgatory from Dante's Purgatorio.\nThe Seven Storey Mountain was published in 1948 and was unexpectedly successful. The first printing was planned for 7,500 copies, but pre-publication sales exceeded 20,000. By May 1949, 100,000 copies were in print and, according to Time magazine, it was among the best-selling non-fiction books in the country for the year 1949. The original hardcover edition eventually sold over 600,000 copies, and paperback sales exceeded three million by 1984. A British edition, edited by Evelyn Waugh, was titled Elected Silence. The book has remained continuously in print, and has been translated into more than 15 languages. The 50th-anniversary edition, published in 1998 by Harvest Books, included an introduction by Merton's editor, Robert Giroux, and a note by biographer and Thomas Merton Society founder William Shannon.\nApart from being on the National Review's list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the century, it was also mentioned in 100 Christian Books That Changed the Century (2000) by William J.

Upon his conversion, Merton left a promising literary career, resigned his position as a teacher of English literature at St. Bonaventure's College in Olean, New York, and entered the Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani in rural Kentucky. Describing his entry, Merton writes, \"Brother Matthew locked the gate behind me, and I was enclosed in the four walls of my new freedom.\" Later, Dom Frederic Dunne, the abbot at the abbey, who had received him as a novice, suggested that Merton write out his life story, which he reluctantly began, but once he did, it started \"pouring out\". Soon he was filling up his journals with the work that led to the book which Time magazine later described as having \"redefined the image of monasticism and made the concept of saintliness accessible to moderns\".In Merton's journals, the first entry mentioning the project is dated March 1, 1946, but many scholars think he started writing it earlier than that, because the draft (more than 600 pages) reached his agent Naomi Burton Stone by October 21, 1946.In late 1946, the partly approved text of The Seven Storey Mountain was sent to Naomi Burton, his agent at Curtis Brown literary agency, who then forwarded it to the renowned book editor Robert Giroux at Harcourt Brace publishers. Giroux read it overnight, and the next day phoned Naomi with an offer, who accepted it on the monastery's behalf. With Merton having taken a vow of poverty, all the royalties were to go to the Abbey community. Soon a trouble arose, though, when an elderly censor from another abbey objected to Merton's colloquial prose style, which he found inappropriate for a monk. Merton appealed (in French) to the Abbot General in France, who concluded that an author's style was a personal matter, and subsequently the local censor also reversed his opinion, paving the way for the book's publication.Edward Rice, a friend of Merton, suggests a different story behind the censorship issues. Rice believes the censor's comments did have an effect on the book. The censors were not primarily concerned with Merton's prose style, but rather the content of his thoughts in the autobiography. It was \"too frank\" for the public to handle. What was published was a \"castrated\" version of the original manuscript. At the time Rice published his opinion, he was unable to provide any proof; however, since then early drafts of the autobiography have surfaced and prove that parts of the manuscript were either deleted or changed. In the introduction to the 50th-anniversary edition of the autobiography, Giroux acknowledges these changes and provides the original first paragraph of Merton's autobiography. Originally, it began \"When a man is conceived, when a human nature comes into being as an individual, concrete, subsisting thing, a life, a person, then God's image is minted into the world. A free, vital, self-moving entity, a spirit informing flesh, a complex of energies ready to be set into fruitful motion begins to flame with love, without which no spirit can exist...\" The published autobiography begins with \"On the last day of January 1915, under the sign of the Water Bearer, in a year of a great war, and down in the shadow of some French Mountains on the borders of Spain, I came into the world.\"In the middle of 1948, advance proofs were sent to Evelyn Waugh, Clare Boothe Luce, Graham Greene and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, who responded with compliments and quotations which were used on the book jacket and in some advertisements. The first printing run was increased from 5,000 to 12,500. Thus, the book was out in October 1948, and by December it had sold 31,028 copies and was declared a bestseller by Time magazine. The New York Times, however, initially refused to put it on the weekly Best Sellers list, on the grounds that it was \"a religious book\".

The Book of Han bibliography section (\u85dd\u6587\u5fd7) says it has eight chapters (\u7bc7) and concludes that since the Zhuangzi quotes Liezi, he must have lived before Zhuangzi. There is a three-century historical gap until the next evidence of the Liezi: the Jin dynasty commentary by Zhang Zhan \u5f35\u6e5b (fl. ca. 370 CE). Zhang's preface claims his Liezi copy was transmitted down from his grandfather. All received Liezi texts derive from Zhang's version, which is divided into eight chapters (juan \u5dfb).\nDuring the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the Liezi was designated a Daoist classic, completing the trilogy with the more famous Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi, it was honorifically entitled the Chongxu zhenjing (\u6c96\u865b\u771f\u7d93; \"True Classic of Simplicity and Vacuity\", that is, Classic of the Perfect Emptiness). This \"Simplicity and Vacuity\" is Wing-tsit Chan's translation; chongxu (literally \"soar/young/simple empty/skies/modest\") usually means \"soar aloft, rise high; carefree, unburdened with ambition\". During the later reign of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, the Liezi was further honored as the Chongxu zhide zhenjing (\u6c96\u865b\u81f3\u5fb7\u771f\u7d93; \u201cTrue Classic of Simplicity and Vacuity and Perfect Virtue\u201d).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27064", "text": "The eight Liezi chapters are shown below (with translations of titles adapted from Graham 1960).\n\nMost Liezi chapters are named after famous figures in Chinese mythology and history.

BCE); or philosophers like Confucius (551\u2013479 BCE) and Yang Zhu (fl. ca. 350 BCE).\nThe Liezi is generally considered to be the most practical of the major Taoist works, compared to the poetic narrative of Laozi and the philosophical writings of Zhuangzi. Although the Liezi has not been extensively published in the West, some passages are well known.  For example, Gengsangzi gives this description of Taoist pure experience:\n My body is in accord with my mind, my mind with my energies, my energies with my spirit, my spirit with Nothing. Whenever the minutest existing thing or the faintest sound affects me, whether it is far away beyond the eight borderlands, or close at hand between my eyebrows and eyelashes, I am bound to know it. However, I do not know whether I perceived it with the seven holes in my head and my four limbs, or knew it through my heart and belly and internal organs.

They share many characters and stories; Graham  lists sixteen complete episodes plus sections from others. The Zhuangzi also mentions Liezi in four chapters and Lie Yukou in three, for example, the famous passage about Liezi's ability to ride the wind and go flying around in chapter 1.The final two chapters have heterogeneous contents that differ from the Daoism elsewhere in the book. Chapter 7 records the Yangism philosophy of \"Yang Zhu\" (Yangzi), infamous for the criticism of Mencius that he, \"believed in 'every man for himself.' If he could have helped the whole world by plucking out a single hair, he would not have done it.\" Zhang Zhan speculates that this chapter, focusing on indulgence in physical and temporary pleasures, was from Lie Yukou's earlier years in Yangism, before he became a Daoist. The well-known scholar of Chinese philosophy, Wing-Tsit Chan calls the \"Yang Zhu\" chapter \"negative Daoism\" in contrast with the Daoism of Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Huainanzi that were \"all positive in that each represents something new.\" Chapter 8, \"Explaining Conjunctions,\" is primarily taken from other early sources, not only Daoist but Confucian and Mohist texts, two philosophies that opposed the philosophical Daoism this book expounds.\nA. C. Graham, Professor Emeritus of the School of Oriental and African Studies, illuminated the textual provenance. After his translation of Liezi in 1960, which Barrett calls undoubtedly \"the best translation into a Western language to date\", Graham linguistically analyzed internal evidence and textual parallels. He discovered many cases where the Liezi is clearly secondary to other texts, but none where it is the primary source for a passage. The Preface to the revised Liezi translation explains his significant change in attitude.\n\nAlthough in 1960 most scholars in China already recognized the late date of [Liezi], most Westerners were still disinclined to question its antiquity. My own textual studies, not yet completed when this translation first appeared, supported the Chinese dating, which by now prevails also in the West. \u2026 One result of the textual investigation came as a surprise to me. The present book describes the hedonist 'Yang [Zhu]' chapter as 'so unlike the rest of [Liezi] that it must be from another hand \u2026 The thought is certainly very different, and it does show the signs of editing and interpolation by the Taoist author \u2026 But although close scrutiny generally reveals marked differences in style between the body of the book and passages borrowed from earlier sources, I could find none to distinguish the hedonist chapter from the rest.\nOwing to occasional Liezi textual misunderstandings in Zhang Zhan's commentary, Graham concludes that the \"guiding hand\" probably belonged to Zhang's father or grandfather, which would mean c. 300 CE.\nSuggestions of Buddhist influences in Liezi chapters 3 and 6 are potentially corroborating evidence for a late date of composition; see Buddhism in China. \"King Mu of Zhou\" discusses sense perceptions as illusions; \"Endeavor and Destiny\" takes a fatalistic (if not karmic) view of destiny, which goes against the traditional Daoist concept of Wuwei.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27066", "text": "Liezi is known as one of the three most important texts in Taoism, together with the Tao Te Ching and  Zhuangzi.

In particular, it features the quest undertaken by several characters to uncover the secret of a mysterious device, the Schwarzger\u00e4t (\"black device\"), which is slated to be installed in a rocket with the serial number \"00000\".\nTraversing a wide range of knowledge, Gravity's Rainbow crosses boundaries between high and low culture, between literary propriety and profanity, and between science and speculative metaphysics. It shared the 1974 US National Book Award for Fiction with A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories by Isaac Bashevis Singer. Although selected by the Pulitzer Prize jury on fiction for the 1974 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the Pulitzer Advisory Board was offended by its content, some of which was described as \"'unreadable,' 'turgid,' 'overwritten' and in parts 'obscene'\". No Pulitzer Prize was awarded for fiction that year. The novel was nominated for the 1973 Nebula Award for Best Novel.Time named Gravity's Rainbow one of its \"All-Time 100 Greatest Novels\", a list of the best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005 and it is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest American novels ever written.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27089", "text": "Part One: \"Beyond the Zero\": The opening pages of the novel follow Pirate Prentice, an employee of the Special Operations Executive (S.O.E.), first in his dreams, and later around the house in wartime London that he shares with several others in the S.O.E. He soon is driven to the site of a V-2 rocket strike.  Pirate's associate Teddy Bloat photographs a map depicting the sexual encounters of U.S. Army Lt. Tyrone Slothrop, an employee of a fictional technical intelligence unit, ACHTUNG. Slothrop and his background are detailed through discussions by some of his co-workers and through references to his family's history, reaching back to early colonial times, in the Berkshire Mountains of western Massachusetts. (There are loose parallels to Pynchon's own family history.)  Slothrop's (fictional) home town of Mingeborough is mentioned for the first time (although the town and a young boy named Hogan Slothrop had previously been featured in Pynchon's short story, \"The Secret Integration\"). That family setting will be mentioned several times much later in the novel, following the family's decline over time within a Puritan legacy of sterility and death.\nEmployees of a fictional top secret psychological warfare agency called PISCES, headquartered at a former insane asylum known as \"The White Visitation\", investigate Slothrop's map of his presumed sexual encounters in London, finding that each location appears to precede a V-2 rocket strike in the same place by several days. This coincidence intrigues Pavlovian behavioral psychologist Edward W. Pointsman, who thinks there may be a direct causal relationship between Slothrop's erections and the missile strikes, and his associate, statistician Roger Mexico, who suggests that the relationship is only a random coincidence of probabilities, as seen in Poisson distributions, leading to further reflections in this section and later on topics as broad as the occult, Determinism, the reverse flow of time, and the sexuality of the rocket itself. Pointsman is all the more intrigued to find that as a baby, Slothrop had been subjected to behavioral experiments conducted by a Dr. Laszlo Jamf that involved the stimulation of his penis to erections.\nMany characters not significant until later are introduced in \"Beyond the Zero\", including one of Dr. Jamf's former students, Franz P\u00f6kler, a German engineer who has worked on early German experiments in rocketry and later on the V-2 rocket, and P\u00f6kler's wife Leni, a former student radical. Others who appear significant in Part One, such as Pointsman's associate Thomas Gwenhidwy and Roger Mexico's girlfriend Jessica Swanlake, vanish from the narrative and don't re-appear until much later. Indeed, most of the 400 named characters make only single appearances, serving merely to demonstrate the sheer scope of Pynchon's universe. Character names sometimes consist of outrageous puns (such as \"Joaquin Stick\") but may also relate to particular traits of that character or to themes within the novel. Some names of historical characters also have thematic relevance. Under the influence of sodium amytal administered through Pointsman's maneuvers, Slothrop has a hallucinatory flashback to a scene in Boston's Roxbury district. References here include \"Red, the Negro shoeshine boy,\" who will much later be known as the Black Power leader Malcolm X, and jazz saxophonist Charlie \"Yardbird\" Parker, both of whom represent a threat to white racism. Another fictional character, Katje Borgesius, is contacted in this section by Pirate in order to bring her to safety from the Continent to England. Katje had been a Dutch double agent who infiltrated a V-2 rocket-launching battery commanded by a sadistic SS officer named Captain Blicero. Blicero had kept Katje and a young soldier named Gottfried as sex slaves in a perverse enactment of the Hansel and Gretel story. However, Blicero (a Teutonic name connoting Death) is also revealed to be the code name of a former Lieutenant Weissman (\"White Man\")  who earlier appeared in Pynchon's first novel, V. He has had an ongoing but now-severed relationship with Enzian, a Herero he had brought to Germany from German South West Africa (now Namibia), and who is the leader of a group of Herero rocket technicians known as the Schwarzkommando, who had been helping Blicero in his own project to create and fire a rocket. Katje, on the other hand, will come under Pointsman's control in England, while, as the Christmas season ends, Roger Mexico worries about losing Jessica Swanlake to her other, bureaucratic and sedate, boyfriend, Jeremy (also referred to as \"Beaver\" because of his beard).\nPart Two: \"Une Perm au Casino Hermann Goering\": Slothrop is sent away by his superiors under mysterious circumstances to a casino on the recently liberated French Riviera, in which almost the entirety of Part Two takes place. He is in fact being monitored by associates of Pointsman, including Katje and a linguist named Sir Stephen Dodson-Truck. One of the more bizarre Pavlovian episodes involves the conditioning of trained octopus Grigori to attack Katje. Early in part two, the octopus attacks Katje on the beach in France, and Slothrop is \"conveniently\" at hand to rescue her. Katje and Slothrop eventually have sex. At the Casino, he learns of a rocket with the irregular serial number 00000 (Slothrop comments that the numbering system doesn't allow for four zeroes in one serial, let alone five), which features a mysterious component called the S-Ger\u00e4t (short for Schwarzger\u00e4t, 'black device'), made out of the hitherto unknown plastic Imipolex G. It is hinted that Slothrop's prescience of rocket hits is due to being conditioned as an infant by the creator of Imipolex G, Laszlo Jamf. Later, the reality of this story is called into question, as is the very existence of Slothrop's original sexual exploits.\nMeanwhile, at The White Visitation, Pointsman brings the unit and its mission under his control. The unit's nominal commander, Brigadier General Ernest Pudding, who is haunted by his traumatic memories of World War I, is brought to (literal) submission through sado-masochistic rituals with Katje, engineered by Pointsman.\nSlothrop becomes increasingly paranoid, as old associates disappear. He begins to suspect he is being monitored and adopts the persona (one of many) of \"Ian Scuffling,\" a British war correspondent. He escapes from the casino into \"The Zone\", the coalescing post-war wasteland of Europe, first to Nice in France and then to Switzerland, searching for the 00000 and S-Ger\u00e4t. In the closing of Part Two, Katje is revealed to be safe in England, enjoying a day at the beach with Roger Mexico and Jessica, as well as Pointsman, who is in charge of Slothrop's furtive supervision. While unable to contact Slothrop (or prohibited from contacting him), Katje continues to follow his actions through Pointsman, who is showing greater signs of mental instability.\nPart Three, \"In The Zone\": Slothrop's quest continues for some time as he meets or is chased by other characters, compared at various times to such characters as Orpheus and Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user. He learns more about his own past, Dr. Jamf's experiments on him, and his father's apparent complicity. In this section, Slothrop comes to doubt that his search for the S-Gerat is a Grail quest and finds his paranoia (\"the fear that everything is connected\") succumbing to \"anti-paranoia\" (\"the fear that nothing is connected\"). On the way he meets Geli Tripping, a self-described witch in love with a Russian colonel, Vaslav Tchitcherine, who had previously worked for the Soviet state bringing the New Turkic Alphabet to central Asia, especially Soviet Kazakhstan, where he had sought a mystical experience referred to as the \"Kirghiz Light\". Slothrop and Geli have a near-mystical experience at the summit of the Brocken, the German mountain that was the setting for Walpurgisnacht in Goethe's Faust. Slothrop's travels bring him to Nordhausen, in Germany, and the Mittelwerk, where V-2 rockets were assembled using slave labor from the Dora concentration camp. Confronted by the racist American Major Duane Marvy, he escapes in a slapstick chase.\nSlothrop meets members of the Schwarzkommando, a fictional cadre of African rocket technicians, descended from survivors of the Herero genocide of 1904 who were brought to Europe by German colonials. An extensive subplot details a schism within the Schwarzkommando; one faction is bent on a program of racial suicide, while the other finds mystical, semi-religious meaning in the V-2 rocket. Another long subplot details Tchitcherine's past and his quest to hunt and kill Enzian, leader of the latter group of Schwarzkommando and, it turns out, Tchitcherine's half-brother.\nWith papers identifying him as former German film star Max Schlepzig in Berlin, Slothrop adopts an operatic Viking costume with the horns removed from the helmet, making it look like a rocket nose-cone and is given the name \"Rocketman\". One of the people he meets is the American sailor Pig Bodine (who or whose ancestors appear in most of Pynchon's other works). Bodine commissions Slothrop to retrieve a large stash of hashish from the centre of the Potsdam Conference. In the nearby abandoned movie studio that was once the center of the German film industry, Slothrop meets Margherita (Greta) Erdmann, a former silent film actress from the era of German Expressionist film, now in physical and mental decline. Slothrop also comes to meet Gerhardt von G\u00f6ll, a megalomaniac German director who had previously been seen in Britain, directing a fake propaganda film featuring Black soldiers in Germany. Von G\u00f6ll is now involved in black market activities. In the longest episode of the book, we learn more of the history of Franz P\u00f6kler, who fathered a child, Ilse, with his wife Leni after being aroused by Greta's image in an erotic scene in Alpdr\u00fccken, von G\u00f6ll's \"masterpiece\". Greta had also become pregnant in the filming of that scene, producing a daughter of her own, Bianca. While working on the V-2 project, P\u00f6kler had been coerced into working on the S-Ger\u00e4t by Blicero, who was holding Ilse in a concentration camp, allowing her to visit P\u00f6kler only once a year. As Ilse ages over several years, however, P\u00f6kler becomes increasingly paranoid that she is really a series of impostors sent each year to mollify him. P\u00f6kler's work for Blicero is tied to the history of organic chemistry, with its own outcomes in the production of dyes and plastics and the international cartels that would come to control them, such as I.G. Farben, and a culture of death-in-life.\nSlothrop is led by Margherita to northern Germany and onto the Anubis, a private yacht (named for the Egyptian god of the dead) filled with uninhibited European aristocrats. Here, Slothrop has sex with Margherita's teenage daughter, Bianca. Margherita, along with her partner, Thanatz, are revealed to know more about the 00000, S-Ger\u00e4t, and Imipolex G than they let on. Ensign Morituri, a Japanese liaison officer, tells Slothrop about how Margherita and Thanatz had brought their traveling sado-masochistic act to Captain Blicero's rocket battery, from which Rocket 00000 had apparently been fired in the spring of 1945, towards the end of the war. Margherita spent many days in a mysterious and ambiguously described factory, where she was clothed in an outfit made from the \"erotic\" plastic Imipolex G. Slothrop falls overboard and is rescued by black marketeers heading towards Peenem\u00fcnde, the test site for the V-2 rocket, now occupied by Soviet forces.\nSlothrop later returns to the Anubis to find Bianca dead, possibly hastening his already hinted-at decline. He continues his pilgrimage through northern Germany, having changed clothing with Tchitcherine, arriving at L\u00fcneberg Heath and the town of Cuxhaven, also sites of tests and launches by Allied forces of captured V-2 rockets. On the way, he again meets Major Marvy, who fails to recognize him. At a village festival, he is invited by children to don the costume of a pre-Christian Pig Hero, \"Plechazunga.\"  Meeting P\u00f6kler at the abandoned amusement park where Ilse used to meet her father, Slothrop finds out more about his childhood and the 00000. It becomes steadily apparent that Slothrop is connected to Laszlo Jamf through Lyle Bland, a Slothrop family friend who apparently played a role in funding Jamf's experiments on the infant Slothrop. Bland, in turn, is connected to many threads, including pinball machines and the Masons, that implicate him as part of an international conspiracy of industrial cartels.\nSlothrop is introduced to and sleeps with Solange, a prostitute who is actually Leni P\u00f6kler, recently freed from a concentration camp herself. In the same building, Major Marvy has found Slothrop's pig costume and dons it, only to be caught, sedated, and castrated by agents working for Pointsman, who believe that Slothrop is still in the suit. Major political and social realignments have been taking place throughout The Zone. Towards the end of this section, several characters not seen since early in the novel make a return, including Pointsman, who is now in official disgrace, as bureaucratic operatives consider how to deal with him. Other characters, including Pirate Prentice and Katje Borgesius, begin to coalesce as a group styling itself as the \"Counterforce\" in resistance to the emerging post-war industrial-military complex.\nPart Four: The Counterforce: Elements in this section become increasingly fantastic and sometimes self-referential, the narrator at one point saying, \"You will want cause and effect. All right\" (page 663 in the Viking edition) before explaining how certain events in Part 3 tie in. Despite the efforts of some to save him, Slothrop is repeatedly sidetracked until his persona fragments totally, more than one hundred pages before the novel's end. A flashback reveals how Roger Mexico, now in Germany, has come to join the Counterforce despite its inherent contradictions as a group organizing against international organizations. A long digression gives the story of \"Byron the Bulb,\" a sentient, seemingly immortal lightbulb whose existence links with Dr. Jamf and his experiments and to the integration of power companies and their Grid to the network of cartels. The Schwarzkommando become reunited and finish construction of their own version of the 00000 rocket.\nThere are several brief, hallucinatory stories of comic, fallible superheroes; silly Kamikaze pilots; and an \"Incident in the Transvestites' Toilet\" where Slothrop has been hiding in drag. Such incidents may be products of Slothrop's finally collapsed mind; or of the increasingly chaotic state of affairs outside the realm of a rising technological class and society that comes to be labeled the \"Raketen-Stadt\" (Rocket-State) of the future. For Slothrop, these scenes more or less culminate with his finding, and failing to understand, a headline announcing the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.\nTchitcherine is told by his superior officer that he is to head back to the U.S.S.R. with some German rocket scientists, despite his own misgivings about Marxist dialectics. A conference is held by members of the Counterforce, which now includes some with questionable pasts, personalities, or motives, such as von G\u00f6ll. Jessica tells Roger that she is going to marry Jeremy/Beaver. Invited to a dinner at the home of a German industrialist, Roger and Pig Bodine manage to escape with the help of some disgusting culinary repartee, but it becomes increasingly clear that the Counterforce does not have the capacity to counter the emerging Rocket State, in part because \"the Man has a branch office in each of our brains.\"\nSome individuals, however, provide some hope. Earlier, Slothrop had encountered a young boy on what seems to be a futile quest to find his lost pet lemming. Meeting once again, it turns out that the lemming has been found. Geli Tripping's complete love for Tchitcherine and her connection with the natural organic world contrasts with a flashback in which Blicero explains to Gottfried his obsessive desire to transcend nature and \"its cycle of infection and death.\"  Geli does cast a spell on Tchitcherine that (perhaps) keeps him from recognizing Enzian when they finally meet, averting a potentially fatal encounter.\nThe final identification of Slothrop of any certainty is his picture on the cover of an album by obscure English band \"The Fool\" (another allusion to Tarot, which becomes increasingly significant), where he is credited as playing the harmonica and kazoo. The hundred pages or so of the novel include titled vignettes that summarize events in Slothrop's home town of Mingeborough; offer a (self-referential) reading of the Tarot cards for Weismann/Blicero, who also prepares for a final launch of the 00000 rocket with Gottfried in the nosecone; describe failed last-minute non-rescues by popular culture heroes; and allude to the Sacrifice of Isaac and the mythical figures of Apollo and Orpheus.\nAs the novel draws to an ambiguous close, the launch of the rocket with Gottfried is intercut with scenes contemporary to the novel's publication, at the (fictional) Orpheus (movie) Theater in Los Angeles, managed by a character named \"Richard M. Zhlubb,\" a thinly-veiled parody of President Richard Nixon. Zhlubb is running a \"Bengt Ekerot / Maria Casares Film Festival.\"  Both actors played personifications of Death, in Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal and Jean Cocteau's Orpheus, respectively, overt examples of several possible references in the novel to European modernist cinema. The novel concludes as a rocket (perhaps Weissman's) is frozen in its last moment of descent above the theater, where the film being projected has broken, and a hymn composed by Slothrop's heretical colonial ancestor, William Slothrop, is offered.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27090", "text": "Poet L. E. Sissman, in his Gravity's Rainbow review for The New Yorker, said of Pynchon: \"He is almost a mathematician of prose, who calculates the least and the greatest stress each word and line, each pun and ambiguity, can bear, and applies his knowledge accordingly and virtually without lapses, though he takes many scary, bracing linguistic risks. Thus his remarkably supple diction can first treat a painful and delicate love scene and then roar, without pause, into the sounds and echoes of a drudged and drunken orgy.\"The plot of the novel is complex, containing over 400 characters and involving many different threads of narrative which intersect and weave around one another. The recurring themes throughout the plot are the V-2 rocket, interplay between free will and Calvinistic predestination, breaking the cycle of nature, behavioral psychology, sexuality, paranoia and conspiracy theories such as the Phoebus cartel and the Illuminati. Gravity's Rainbow also draws heavily on themes that Pynchon had probably encountered at his work as a technical writer for Boeing, where he edited a support newsletter for the Bomarc Missile Program support unit. The Boeing archives are known to house a vast library of historical V-2 rocket documents, which were probably accessible to Pynchon. The novel is narrated by many distinct voices, a technique further developed in Pynchon's much later novel Against the Day. The style and tone of the voices vary widely:  Some narrate the plot in a highly informal tone, some are more self-referential, and some might even break the fourth wall. Some voices narrate in drastically different formats, ranging from movie-script format to stream of consciousness prose.\nThe narrative contains numerous descriptions of illicit sexual encounters and drug use by the main characters and supporting cast, sandwiched between dense dialogues or reveries on historic, artistic, scientific, or philosophical subjects, interspersed with whimsical nonsense-poems and allusions to obscure facets of 1940s pop culture. Many of the recurring themes will be familiar to experienced Pynchon readers, including the singing of silly songs, recurring appearances of kazoos, and extensive discussion of paranoia. According to Richard Locke, megalomaniac paranoia is the \"operative emotion\" behind the novel, and an increasingly central motivator for the many main characters. In many cases, this paranoia proves to be vindicated, as the many plots of the novel become increasingly interconnected, revolving around the identity and purpose of the elusive 00000 Rocket and Schwarzger\u00e4t. The novel becomes increasingly preoccupied with themes of Tarot, Paranoia, and Sacrifice. All three themes culminate in the novel's ending, and the epilogue of the many characters. The novel also features the character Pig Bodine, of Pynchon's novel V. Bodine would later become a recurring avatar of Pynchon's complex and interconnected fictional universe, making an appearance in nearly all of Pynchon's novels thereafter.\nSeveral characters and situations from Pynchon's earlier works make at least brief appearances in the novel. Slothrop's (fictional) home town of Mingeborough, Massachusetts was the setting for his short story \"The Secret Integration,\" which featured a young character named Hogan Slothrop, who in retrospect would seem to be Tyrone's nephew. Weismann (aka Blicero) and the story of the Herero genocide appeared in the chapter \"Mondaugen's Story\" in V.  The eponymous character Kurt Mondaugen also reappears in Gravity's Rainbow. Some early reviewers even suggested that Gravity's Rainbow was a sequel to Pynchon's first novel, playing on the term \"V-2\".  In Gravity's Rainbow, Clayton \"Bloody\" Chiclitz is a toy manufacturer accompanying Major Marvy, but he appeared later as a defense contract magnate in The Crying of Lot 49, and his company. Yoyodyne, was introduced in V. Pig Bodine also appeared in V. but had his origin in Pynchon's early short story \"Low-Lands.\"  Bodine or variants on his name and character also appear in later Pynchon novels. A very minor character in Gravity's Rainbow, Ronald Cherrycoke, would seem to be a descendant of the Reverend Wicks Cherrycoke, who narrates Pynchon's later novel Mason & Dixon.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27091", "text": "On the novel's publication in 1973, it was reviewed in the New York Times by Richard Locke under the headline \"One of the Longest, Most Difficult, Most Ambitious Novels in Years\". Locke compared Pynchon's writing to that of Vladimir Nabokov, and wrote that \"its technical and verbal resources bring to mind Melville and Faulkner. Immersing himself in 'the destructive element' and exploring paranoia, entropy and the love of death as primary forces in the history of our time, Pynchon establishes his imaginative continuity with the great modernist writers of the early years of this century.\" Locke noted  that \"Pynchon is obviously capable of the most intricate literary structures\u2014plots and counterplots and symbols that twist and tangle in time and space\", but was less impressed by the novel's form: \"the structure is strained beyond the breaking point. Reading it is often profoundly exasperating; the book is too long and dense; despite the cornucopia of brilliant details and grand themes, one's dominant feelings in the last one to two hundred pages are a mounting restlessness, fatigue and frustration.\"Reviewing the novel in the Saturday Review in March 1973, Richard Poirier stated that \"At thirty-six, Pynchon has established himself as a novelist of major importance.\" In the highly positive review, Poirier compared Gravity's Rainbow to Moby Dick and Ulysses, and that it  \"marks an advance beyond either book in its treatment of cultural inheritance\". Poirier noted the wide range of Pynchon's writing and said that \"Pynchon is willing and able, that is, to work from a range of perspectives infinitely wider, more difficult to manage, more learned than any to be found elsewhere in contemporary literature. His genius resides in his capacity to see, to see feelingly, how these various perspectives, apparently so diverse and chaotic, are begotten of the same technology, the same supportive structures that have foundations in the theology of the seventeenth century and the science of the nineteenth.\" (...) \"Pynchon is almost unbearably vulnerable to every aspect of contemporary experience, open to every form of sight and sound, democratically receptive to the most common and the most recondite signatures of things.\"Anthony Burgess included Gravity's Rainbow in his Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English Since 1939 (1984), writing \"this work, not yet as widely understood [as V. or The Crying of Lot 49], has a gravity more compelling than the rainbow technique (high colour, symbolism, prose tricks) would seem to imply\".On the 50th anniversary of the publication in February 2023, John Semley positively reviewed Gravity's Rainbow in Wired, noting that: \"It is at once a busy almanac of its era and a sort of field guide for our own. It echoes eerily in the new-ish millennium. In a way, our own age's greasy stew of absurdity and apocalypticism, creeping death tinged with clown-shoe idiocy, suggests a world that has finally, fatefully, caught up with Pynchon. We are still living under Gravity's Rainbow.\"The character name \"Tyrone Slothrop\" has been read as an anagram of \"Sloth or Entropy\" by writer Salman Rushdie.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27092", "text": "Italian scholar Guido Almansi described it as the greatest American novel published after the end of the Second World War.

Literary scholar Tony Tanner has hailed it as \"both one of the great historical novels of our time and arguably the most important literary text since Ulysses.\"Though the book won the National Book Award for 1974, Pynchon chose neither to accept nor acknowledge this award. Thomas Guinzberg of the Viking Press suggested that the comedian \"Professor\" Irwin Corey accept the award on his behalf, to which Pynchon agreed. Corey's comical address at the ceremony was also noteworthy for being interrupted by a streaker crossing the stage.Gravity's Rainbow has been translated to many languages, including French (as Rainbow, 1975),  Spanish (as El arco iris de la gravedad, 1978), German (as Die Enden der Parabel, 1981) and Serbian (as Duga gravitacije, 2019).

Later English editions, such as the 1869 Hamburg edition with a preface by Marx, were entitled The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. The essay serves as a major historiographic application of Marx's \"materialist conception of history\".\nThe Eighteenth Brumaire focuses on the 1851 French coup d'\u00e9tat, by which Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, president of the Second Republic and Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte's nephew, became emperor of the Second French Empire as Napoleon III. It seeks to explain how capitalism and class struggle created conditions which enabled \"a grotesque mediocrity to play a hero's part\". Marx describes the divisions and alliances among the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, the peasantry, revolutionaries, and social democrats, among other groups, and how a lack of dominance of any one led to the re-emergence of monarchy, despite the Revolution of 1848. Marx describes the Second Empire as a \"Bonapartist\" state, an exception to the basic Marxist conception of the state as an instrument of class rule in that the Bonapartist state becomes semi-autonomous, representing the interests of no single class.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27094", "text": "The Eighteenth Brumaire is regarded by the social historian C. J. Coventry as the first social history, the base model or template for E. P. Thompson's Making of the English Working Class (1963). Social history gained popularity in the 1960s. According to Oliver Cussen, the rise of cultural history in the 1990s, in line with neoliberal capitalism, saw Marx's perception of the necessity of revolutionary change replaced with Alexis de Tocqueville's elitist pessimism that popular revolt would only result in despots.Two of Marx's most recognizable quotes appear in the essay. The first is on history repeating itself: \"Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce\". The second concerns the role of the individual in history: \"Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.

And the same caricature occurs in the circumstances of the second edition of the Eighteenth Brumaire.\nMarx's sentiment echoed an observation made by Friedrich Engels at exactly the same time Marx began work on this book. In a letter to Marx of 3 December 1851, Engels wrote from Manchester:\n\n.... it really seems as though old Hegel, in the guise of the World Spirit, were directing history from the grave and, with the greatest conscientiousness, causing everything to be re-enacted twice over, once as grand tragedy and the second time as rotten farce, Caussidi\u00e8re for Danton, L.

Ansky headed an ethnographic commission, financed by Baron Vladimir G\u00fcnzburg and named in honor of his father Horace G\u00fcnzburg, which traveled through Podolia and Volhynia in the Pale of Settlement. They documented the oral traditions and customs of the native Jews, whose culture was slowly disintegrating under the pressure of modernity. According to his assistant Samuel Schreier-Shrira, Ansky was particularly impressed by the stories he heard in Miropol of a local sage, the hasidic rebbe Samuel of Kaminka-Miropol (1778 \u2013 May 10, 1843), who was reputed to have been a master exorcist of dybbuk spirits. Samuel served as the prototype for the character Azriel, who is also said to reside in that town. Historian Nathaniel Deutsch suggested he also drew inspiration from the Maiden of Ludmir, who was also rumored to have been possessed, thus explaining her perceived inappropriate manly behavior.Craig Stephen Cravens deduced that Ansky began writing the play in late 1913. It was first mentioned in a reply to him from Baron G\u00fcnzburg, on 12 February 1914, who commented he read a draft and found it compelling. The original was in Russian; shortly after completing it, the author was advised by friends to translate it into Yiddish. In the summer, he started promoting The Dybbuk, hoping it would be staged by a major Russian theater. He was rebuffed by Semyon Vengerov of the Alexandrinsky Theatre, who explained they could not perform another play by a Jew after the negative reaction to Semyon Yushkevich's Mendel Spivak. Ansky then contacted the managers of the Moscow Art Theatre. He failed to secure a meeting with Constantin Stanislavski himself, but director Leopold Sulerzhitsky read the play during the autumn, and replied much further work was required. Guided by him via correspondence, the author rewrote his piece through 1915. When he accepted the revised version in September, Sulerzhitsky regarded it as much better, but not satisfactory. At that time, Ansky's publisher Zinovy Grzhebin submitted it to the state censorship in St. Petersburg. Censor Nikolai von Osten-Driesen commented the banishment of the spirit resembled the Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac, and Ansky rewrote the scene using subtler terms. This version was approved by Driesen on 10 October, after removing another minor reference to angels. The play was still undergoing modifications: on 21 October, Ansky propositioned to Sulerzhitsky they add a prologue, epilogue and a long scene of Leah's wedding day. He agreed, and the censor approved the expanded edition on 30 November. Both copies submitted by Ansky were found in 2001 at the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts. They were considerably different from the known stage version: most notably, the Messenger was not yet conceived.\nStanislavski agreed to review the play, though not thoroughly, on 30 December. Though many accounts link him with The Dybbuk, Cravens commented this is the only actual documentation in the matter. He never even watched The Dybbuk fully. He and the rest of the management continued to request revisions. On 25 November 1916, Ansky wrote in his diary that Stanislavski was almost pleased, asking but for only minor changes in the ending. On 8 January 1917, the press reported the Moscow Art Theatre accepted The Dybbuk and was preparing to stage it.\nAt the very same time, Stanislavski was supporting the incipient Habima Theater, a Hebrew-language venture headed by Nahum Zemach. Ansky read his play to Hillel Zlatopolsky, a patron of Habima, who purchased the rights to translate it to Hebrew. The author set but one condition, demanding it would be handed over to Hayim Nahman Bialik. The latter accepted the task in February and completed it in July. Bialik's translation was the first version of the play to be published: it was released in the Hebrew literary magazine Ha'tkufa in February 1918. Meanwhile, the Moscow Art Theatre's planned production of The Dybbuk encountered severe hardships. Michael Chekhov, cast as Azriel, had a severe nervous breakdown due to the use of extreme acting techniques; Stanislavski fell ill with typhus. On 7 March 1918, Boris Suskevich notified Ansky his play was not to be included in that season's repertoire. The author left the city to Vilnius, losing his original copy on the way, but eventually receiving another from Shmuel Niger. He read his renewed edition before David Herman, director of the Vilna Troupe, but did not live to see it performed. He died on November 8, 1920.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27106", "text": "On 9 December, at the end of the thirty days' mourning after Ansky's departure, Herman and his troupe staged the world premiere of The Dybbuk in Yiddish, at the Warsaw Elizeum Theater. Miriam Orleska, Alexander Stein, Abraham Morevsky and Noah Nachbusch portrayed Leah, Khanan, Azriel and the Messenger, respectively. The play turned into a massive success, drawing large audiences for over a year, from all the shades of society and a considerable number of Christians. A Yiddish columnist in Warsaw remarked that \"of every five Jews in the city, a dozen watched The Dybbuk. How could this be? It is not a play you attend merely once.\" In the Polish capital alone, they staged it over three hundred times. During their tour across Europe between 1922 and 1927, it remained the pinnacle of their repertoire. While most of their acts drew few visitors, The Dybbuk remained an audience magnet.\nOn 1 September 1921, the play had its American premiere in the New York Yiddish Art Theatre of Maurice Schwartz. Celia Adler, Bar Galilee, Schwartz and Julius Adler appeared as Leah, Khanan, Azriel and the Messenger. It ran for several months.\nWhile Habima Theater accepted Bialik's translation much earlier, both the intricacy of the play and the production of others delayed its stagings. Director Yevgeny Vakhtangov planned it for years. He originally cast Shoshana Avivit (Lichtenstein), one of his young actresses, as Leah. Avivit was a notorious prima donna and an intimate friend of Bialik, and abandoned the theater unexpectedly on 21 March 1921, due to constant quarrels with the directors. She was confident that the management would call her back, but they dismissed her of the role of Leah, to Bialik's chagrin; he ceased attending rehearsals. Vakhtangov gave the piece to Hanna Rovina, to the dismay of his associates, who considered the thirty-year-old actress too mature for portraying an eighteen-year-old Leah. Rovina was recovering from Tuberculosis in a sanatorium north of Moscow, and left the establishment in spite of the doctors' protests. Leah became her signature role. The Hebrew-language premiere was staged on 31 January 1922, at Habima's residence in the Sekretariova Theater. Rovina, Miriam Elias (who was replaced by male actors in subsequent stagings), Shabtai Prudkin and Nachum Tzemach appeared in the four leading roles. Habima performed it precisely 300 times in the Soviet Union, 292 in Moscow; the last was on 18 January 1926, before it embarked on an international tour.\nIn the British Mandate of Palestine, it premiered in a makeshift production organized by a labor battalion paving Highway 75; while the exact date was unrecorded, it was sometime in February 1922. Abba Hushi depicted Azriel. Professional stagings soon followed suit. On the 6th and 16 June 1926, in two consecutive meetings, the members of the Hebrew Writers Union in Tel Aviv conducted \"the Dybbuk trial\", a public debate attended by an audience of 5,000 people. They discussed the gap between the needs of the Zionist enterprise and the play's atmosphere, voicing concern that it might overshadow the \"young Hebrew culture\" developing in Palestine, struggling to free itself from the constraints of diaspora mentality. Eventually, they approved the play.\nThe German-language premiere opened on 28 February 1925, in Vienna's Rolandb\u00fchne, with Friedrich Feher as Azriel and Magda Sonja playing Leah. The first English production ran from 15 December 1925 and 1926 at the off-Broadway Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. It was translated and adapted by Henry G. Alsberg and Winifred Katzin. On 31 January 1928, Gaston Baty's French-language version premiered in the Studio des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\nIn 1977, Joseph Chaikin, a central figure in American avant-garde theatre, directed a new translation of The Dybbuk by Mira Rafalowicz, a dramaturg, yiddishist and longtime collaborator of Chaikin's at The Public Theater.

But after a scandal in which von Schlettow is arrested by the police in civilian attire as he attempts to peacefully settle a bar brawl, initiated by a drunk grenadier, von Schlettow is forced to retire, and the uniform is returned to Wormser. Eventually, the uniform is refitted for Dr. Oberm\u00fcller, the mayor of K\u00f6penick, for his promotion to Captain, but during a party afterwards the uniform is indelibly stained in an accidental spilling and ends up in a rag shop.\nWilhelm Voigt, a trained shoemaker who has spent most of his life in prison, is released after yet another stint and tries to make an honest living in his advanced age. However, this is doomed to failure even from the outset as the militarized, inflexible society of the late German Empire offers practically nothing to citizens who have not served in the military (a fact which applies to Voigt). This catches him in a vicious circle: without legal registration (just a simple passport would suffice) he can't get any work, and without any work he can't get a legal registration. In the end, a desperate Voigt resorts to breaking into a post office in order to get the passport, while his friend Kalle goes after the money, but both are caught in the process and Voigt once more goes to jail. During his ten-year stint in Sonneberg Prison, however, he gets formal military training, as the warden is a military enthusiast who enlists his convicts into re-enacting famous battles dating back to the Franco-Prussian War.\nAfter his discharge from prison, Voigt moves in with his sister Marie and his brother-in-law, Friedrich Hoprecht, and takes care of their lodger, a sick young girl named Liese. One evening, while reading a fairy tale to the girl, Voigt receives the official denial of his permit of residence application; this and Liese's death finally move him into resisting the cruel system he is caught in. He procures the uniform, whose authority by appearance and his trained military bearing enable him to recruit a group of grenadiers right off the street without any questions asked. Voigt and his team proceed to the K\u00f6penick city hall where he has Oberm\u00fcller and the whole city council arrested but fails to procure a passport as he had intended (because the passport office is located elsewhere).\nThe publicity which ensues from this feat label the Hauptmann von K\u00f6penick, as he is nicknamed, a folk hero and prankster, but Voigt himself does not draw any joy from this. Eventually he surrenders to the authorities in exchange for the promise of a legal registration, providing the uniform to prove his identity as the Hauptmann. The police officers take his confession and surrender with surprisingly good humor, and in the end Voigt asks to see himself in a mirror dressed in the uniform, as he had not had the opportunity to do so yet.

It was the first of a series of novels she wrote with desert settings that set off a major revival of the \"desert romance\" genre of romantic fiction. It was a huge best-seller and the most popular of her books, and it served as the basis for the film of the same name starring the Italian actor Rudolph Valentino in the title role.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27129", "text": "The novel opens in a hotel in the Algerian city of Biskra. A dance is being held, hosted by a young woman named Diana Mayo and her brother, Sir Aubrey Mayo. It transpires that Diana is planning to leave on a month-long trip into the desert, taking no one with her but an Arab guide. Nobody thinks this is a sensible idea, and Lady Conway disapprovingly attributes Diana's adventurous plan to her \"scandalous\" upbringing. Diana's mother had died giving birth to her and her father had killed himself from grief, with the result that Diana grew up tomboyish, with a freedom that at the time was normally only allowed to boys.\nBefore Diana leaves on her journey, her independent character is further established when she refuses a proposal of marriage, explaining that she doesn't know what love is and doesn't want to know. Once she begins travelling in the desert, it is not long before she is kidnapped by the eponymous Sheik, Ahmed Ben Hassan. It turns out her guide had been bribed.\nAhmed takes Diana to his tent and rapes her, an event that happens off stage, between the second and third chapters. Diana spends a few months as Ahmed's captive, being raped regularly and brooding on her hatred for him and her self-loathing. Eventually, she is allowed increasing liberty and starts going riding with Ahmed's valet, Gaston. One day, she manages to escape Gaston on one of these rides and gallops away. She is quickly recaptured by Ahmed, however, and as they are riding back to camp, she is overcome by the sudden realisation that she is in love with him. She knows she can say nothing of this, as Ahmed\u2014who claims to find love dull\u2014will send her away if he learns of her love.\nOver time, as Diana submits to Ahmed's violent treatment of her, she regains his trust. It is made clear that he is punishing her because she is English, but not why he is doing this. Eventually, Diana is allowed to go riding again but is kidnapped by a rival sheik and taken away. When Ahmed finds this out, he realises his love for her and sets out to get her back. He succeeds but is badly wounded in the process and taken back to his tent. There, one of Ahmed's friends explains to Diana why he hates English: his father, who was English, had dreadfully mistreated his Spanish mother, and Ahmed had sworn revenge on the entire English nation as a result.\nWhen Ahmed finally recovers, he explains to Diana that he is going to send her away. She is upset, especially when he confesses that he is doing so out of love; he can't bear to mistreat her anymore. Although she pleads with him and avows her love, he stands firm. In  despair, Diana reaches for a revolver and attempts to die in the same way as her father. Ahmed wrenches the gun from her, causing the bullet to go astray, and clasps her to him, declaring he will never let her go.

It also adheres to the major convention of the romance novel: the redemption of a 'lost' male by the power of a woman's love. Desert romance as a genre had been pioneered by writers like Robert Smythe Hichens and Kathlyn Rhodes, but The Sheik set off a major and influential revival of the form.Hull's prose makes heavy use of sentimental vocabulary and close focus on emotional states that are associated with the romance novel genre:\n\nDiana thought of her own mother dying in the arms of a husband who adored her, and then of the little Spanish girl slipping away from life, a stranger in a strange land, her heart crying out for the husband whom she still loved, turning in ignorance of his love for consolation in the agony of death to the lover she had denied, and seeking comfort in his arms.Hull was skilled at creating vivid descriptions, but these are often undercut by her reliance on orientalist stereotypes, as in this passage from her 1926 travel memoir Camping in the Sahara: \n\nA string of camels, in charge of wild-eyed desert men and hung with heavy, pendulous sacks stuffed with henna from the south, stalked disdainfully through the crowd with a soft pad of cushioned feet, on their way to the fondouk. Crouched in the sand and dust, ragged and filthy hawkers of sweetmeats and vegetables cursed shrilly when bare-legged boys, clad only in a single garment open to the waist, drove too close to their little stock-in-trade tiny donkeys staggering almost hidden under loads of brushwood and greenstuffs.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27131", "text": "Throughout its history, The Sheik has attracted controversy, though this has shifted in form over the years. When it was published, it was considered an erotic novel and variously described in the press as \"shocking\" and \"poisonously salacious.\"In more recent decades, the novel has been strongly criticised for its central plot element: the idea that rape leads to love \u2013 i.e., forced seduction. Other criticisms have been directed at ideas closely related to the central rape plot: that for women, sexual submission is a necessary and natural condition; and that rape is excused by marriage. Historians have also criticised the Orientalist portrayal of the Arabs in the novel. With its plot centered on the subjugation of a wilful woman, The Sheik has been compared to The Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare.\nCriticism of the novel has been tempered, however, by other writers observing that women writers of Hull's period used the already well-established genre of Orientalist fantasy to begin putting feminist ideas before their primarily female readership. Women appear as protagonists in desert romances, for example, and in The Sheik specifically, the reader is engaged with Diana as an independent-minded and defiant woman for most of the novel's length, before Hull concludes her story in a conventional way. Moreover, it appears the couple means to live in the desert\u2014a break on Hull's part with the typical romance novel ending that sees the heroine safely ensconced in the townhouses and country estates of the European aristocracy.Strong contrasts are also painted between the relative liberty of European women and the servitude of their counterparts from the Middle East:\n\nThat woman could submit to the degrading intimacy and fettered existence of married life filled [Diana] with scornful wonder. To be bound irrevocably to the will and pleasure of a man who would have the right to demand obedience in all that constituted marriage and the strength to enforce those claims revolted her. For a Western woman it was bad enough, but for the women of the East, mere slaves of the passions of the men who owned them, unconsidered, disregarded, reduced to the level of animals, the bare idea made her quiver.Although this passage appears early in the novel and is to a great extent negated by Diana's later submission to Ahmed, the questions it raises about women's rights echo some of the main themes of contemporary suffragists.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The child usually feels a considerable pull back toward the events of the life and he frequently importunes his parents to let them return to the community where they claim that they formerly lived. If the child makes enough particular statements about the previous life, the parents (usually reluctantly) begin inquiries about their accuracy. Often, indeed usually, such attempts at verification do not occur until several years after the child has begun to speak of the previous life. If some verification results, members of the two families visit each other and ask the child whether they recognizes places, objects, and people of their supposed previous existence.\nStevenson set up a network of volunteers to find these spontaneous past life recall cases as soon as the children began to speak of them. He then would carefully question both the family of the living child and the family of the deceased to ensure that they had no contact and that no information would be passed between them. He would obtain detailed information about the deceased, including information not fully known to anyone involved, such as details of the will, that he would use to verify that the child actually did know the information required.\nThe publication of the book was delayed when it was discovered that one of Stevenson's interpreters had been accused of dishonesty. Stevenson claimed that the translator was dishonest in some matters, but \"did not think the man had deceived him\".

Townshend discusses the Mod scene of the 1960s, the effect the war had on his generation, and the development of rock music. He also discusses the effect his childhood had on his music, particularly the rock opera Tommy.The book traces the formation and evolution of the Who, and includes details of their appearance at Woodstock in 1969 and their storied trashing of hotels.

Nevertheless, much of the optimism of the first remained in its expressed hope that war and poverty would be eliminated.\nIn addition to its absolute rejection of theism, deism and belief in credible proof of any afterlife, various political stances were supported, such as opposition to racism and weapons of mass destruction; support of human rights; a proposition of an international court; and the rights to unrestricted contraception, abortion, divorce, and death with dignity (e.g., euthanasia and suicide).\nInitially published with a small number of signatures, the document was circulated and gained thousands more; the American Humanist Association's website encourages visitors to add their own name.  A provision at the end of the Manifesto\u2014stating that the signators do \"not necessarily endorse every detail\" of the document, but only its broad vision\u2014likely helped many overcome reservations about attaching their name.\nOne of the oft-quoted lines that comes from the Manifesto is, \"No deity will save us; we must save ourselves.\"\nThe Humanist Manifesto II first appeared in The Humanist's September/October 1973 edition, when Paul Kurtz and Edwin H.

In 1948 he had the hallucinatory experience of hearing Blake reading \"Ah, Sun-flower\" and two other works (see Allen Ginsberg: the Blake vision). Ginsberg wrote his own \"Sunflower sutra\" in 1955, descriptive, perhaps, of love persisting amidst moral and physical devastation. He also regularly performed readings of the poem.\nAs befits a song, there have been many musical settings of \"Ah! Sun-flower\". The following are the most notable.\nRalph Vaughan Williams included \"Ah! Sun-flower\" in his 1958 song cycle Ten Blake Songs.\nBenjamin Britten's song cycle Songs and Proverbs of William Blake (1965) includes a setting of \"Ah! Sun-flower\".\nEd Sanders of The Fugs set the poem to music and recorded it on The Fugs First Album in 1965.\nFor the passing of the 2nd millennium, British composer Jonathan Dove set the text of \"Ah, Sun-flower\" and two other poems by Blake (\"Invocation\" and \"The Narrow Bud Opens Her Beauties To The Sun\") in his piece The Passing of the Year (2000), a song cycle for double chorus and piano.\nIn 2002, the Canadian sisters Kate and Anna McGarrigle wanted to record Ed Sanders' setting in French; they asked Philippe Tatartcheff to translate the poem, only to find the words no longer scanned with the tune. So they composed a new tune which accommodated both languages. That appeared the following year on their album La vache qui pleure in both English and French recordings.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1966, Will was an English major on a basketball scholarship, in his fourth and final year at the Institute. Will is not interested in a military career, and had only attended on account of his father, also an alumnus. His father died several years before Will started, where he made a promise to eventually wear the Institute's graduate ring. He is generally well-liked and his professors and peers recognize him for his integrity and fairness, although he is also sarcastic and independent. Will struggles to fit into the strict military environment, but finds solace in his three roommates, who have become his closest friends: Tradd St. Croix, the son of an upper-class Charlestonian family, and two brawny Italian-American boys from the North, Dante \"Pig\" Pignetti and Mark Santoro. They all look forward to graduation, although Will's friends will head off to fight in the Vietnam War, which Will is personally against. However, Will does have some pride in the Institute, representing it in basketball. Though anti-war, he also despises the discrimination the Institute faces from civilian students of other colleges due to its military association, which he sees at away games. For example, when Will plays a game against the Virginia Military Institute, which is considered their biggest rival game, he notes that VMI was the only team all season that did not harass him and his teammates. \nRetired U.S. Army officer Colonel Thomas \"The Bear\" Berrineau, the Commandant of Cadets, asks Will to look out for the Institute's first black cadet, Tom Pearce, knowing that Will is the only cadet unopposed to racial integration. Will also begins a secret relationship with Annie Kate Gervais, a girl from an upper-class Charlestonian family who has become pregnant from a boy who refused to marry her, though their relationship is doomed because Will is Irish-American, Catholic, and not wealthy. Will attempts to aid a struggling freshman, Poteete, who has been targeted by numerous upperclassmen. Shamed by his inability to cope with the harshness of the Institute's freshman system, Poteete hangs himself, leaving behind his ominous claim of a \"house where they take freshmen\" to be tormented outside the oversight of the Commandant's office.\nIn an extended flashback, Will then describes his own plebe year three years earlier. Will learns that the only way to survive is to bond closely with the other members of his class against the cadre. Having entered the college on a basketball scholarship, Will is also protected by other members of the basketball team who don't want to see Will physically harmed and, at one point, rescue him from a particularly brutal hazing incident. Many of Will's classmates are not so lucky, and resign from the school due to the unrelenting hazing. \nOne recruit swiftly rises to prominence: Bobby Bentley, who has a problem with urinating on himself due to the stress of hazing but is otherwise in excellent shape. Bentley refuses to quit on himself or his classmates, and endures all the torments the upperclassmen can devise. Conventional hazing methods fail to break Bentley and his classmates gradually rally around him, and making Will's cadre the subject of ridicule of the entire corps of cadets. One evening, Bobby Bentley is taken off campus by unknown individuals and withdraws from the Institute the following day for unknown reasons. A first classman claims that a secret society of cadets had been watching Bobby Bentley and, once it became clear the R Company cadre had failed to run Bentley out of the school, The Ten had decided to act. Near the end of the year, Will's freshman class is recognized as cadets, and the hazing ends. Will vows to himself that he will never participate in tormenting future generations of plebes, seeing no value in organized cruelty.\nBack in Will's senior year, he hears new rumors of The Ten, a mysterious Institute secret society whose members are handpicked for embodying the greatest virtues of the Institute. The Ten ensures certain cadets, deemed unacceptable to \"wear the ring\" (that is, to be a graduate of the Institute, denoted by wearing of a class ring), are run out by any means necessary.   Aided in his investigation by a mentor, a professor in the History department, Will discovers that The Ten are real and are trying to run Pearce out to keep the Institute all white. Meanwhile, Will and the other seniors receive their class rings in a solemn ceremony, and Will wins the final basketball game of his career in quadruple overtime against the Virginia Military Institute.\nAnnie Kate's baby is stillborn and she rejects Will, wanting to forget all about the time she spent pregnant. Will looks further into The Ten and reunites with Bobby Bentley, who reveals that, during their plebe year, he was spirited away to a house, and was threatened, tortured, and finally agreed to quit when The Ten prepared to burn him alive. Bentley says his ultimate decision to quit was not due to the torture, but the realization he no longer wished to be associated with any organization that would have a group like The Ten. Bentley recalls one member of The Ten, whom they piece together as a high-ranking cadet from their plebe year. Will, Mark, and Pig, discovering this Ten member is now a student at a nearby law school, abduct him, then interrogate him on a secluded railroad track until he reveals the location of the house, which is a plantation house owned by General Bentley Durrell, the superintendent of the Institute. When Pearce is kidnapped by the Ten, Will goes to the house and interrupts the torture of Pearce. Pig and Mark arrive to rescue Will as The Ten pursue him, but The Ten now know of the few trying to move against them.\nPearce is intimidated into silence, and The Ten begin a campaign to have Mark, Pig and Will thrown out of the school. Pig is caught on an honor code violation due to The Ten and loses the honor court case, despite Will, Tradd and Mark each speaking in his defense. After he is expelled and drummed out of school, he throws himself in front of a train, killing himself. Will and Mark soon after begin getting demerits for a wide range of offenses, real and fabricated. Just as they are about to be dismissed, Will discovers that Tradd's father was a member of The Ten. He and Mark read his journals and discover the names of all current and former members. They also realize Tradd is the father of Annie Kate's baby, is a member of The Ten in their class, and was thus informing on his roommates from the start. Soon after, Will confronts Tradd and ends their friendship.\nFacing expulsion for excess demerits, Will confronts General Durrell and demands that he and Mark be allowed to graduate. Durrell refuses, citing their extensive list of infractions and the fact that the Institute graduate they kidnapped has contacted him and wants to press charges. The Bear then enters the General's office, informing him that multiple cadets who were run out of the Institute are willing to attest to The Ten's existence and activities in court. General Durrell relents when also faced with the threat of exposure to the press, as evidenced by Mark seen outside with letters containing the information ready to be mailed. Will and Mark are allowed to graduate, but General Durrell's decision to fire Colonel Berrineau as Commandant stands. The General and The Ten survive with their power intact, but forever shaken, as for the first time an opponent has stood against them and won.\nShortly before graduation, Will receives a letter from Annie Kate, thanking him for standing by her and saying he will make a good husband to whatever woman he finds. Reflecting on his graduation, Will notes that eight of his fellow cadets will eventually be killed in action in the Vietnam War, Mark among them. Will also reveals that The Ten member and class \"golden boy\" John Alexander would eventually fade into obscurity, last seen working as a ROTC instructor at a small university, while Mark Santoro tops the entire class in awards for valor. As Will receives his diploma from the Institute, General Durrell coldly orders him not to disgrace the ring, but Will simply replies with \"Dante Pignetti\", honoring his former roommate and showing his contempt for the General by breaking the school's taboo of ever speaking the name of a drummed-out cadet. The Bear appears at their graduation to congratulate Will. Disgusted at seeing General Durrell's signature on his diploma, Will asks Colonel Berrineau to sign it as Will wants the name of a man he can respect on the diploma.

The piece is structured in the style of a Ballad-opera, with songs and choruses, and also has music underlying dialogue, like a melodrama. Pocahontas persuades her father, King Powhatan, to free Smith and becomes attracted to John Rolfe, breaking off her arranged marriage with a neighboring tribal prince, an action that leads to war. Her tribe wins the war, but her father loses trust in the white settlers; Pocahontas warns the settlers who reconcile with Powhatan. Several comic romances end happily, and Smith predicts a great future for the new country.\nThe play deals with relations between Native Americans and the first European settlers in America. Scholars have debated whether the piece is progressive in its depiction of the natives and have commented that the work reflects an emerging American dramatic and musical sensibility. It served to popularize and romanticize the Pocahontas story as an important American myth.\nThe comedy was first performed in 1808 at The Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. It has been cited as the first play about American Indians by an American playwright known to be produced on a professional stage, and possibly the first play produced in America to be then performed in England, although the validity of both statements has been questioned. Its portrayal of Native Americans has been criticized as racially insensitive, but the piece is credited with inspiring a whole new genre of plays about Pocahontas specifically and Native Americans in general, that was prevalent throughout the 19th and early 20th Century. The play was subsequently produced throughout the country.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27218", "text": "Barker was motivated to create a truly \"American\" style of drama to counteract what he saw as \"mental colonialism\" and the American tendency to feel culturally inferior to Europe. For this reason, he looked to native subject matter for the play, as opposed to other American dramatists like John Howard Payne who neglected American subject matter and locations.Although in his preface, Barker cites his primary source of inspiration as John Smith's The Generall Historie of Virginia (1624), he was likely more influenced by a series of popular books by John Davis, including, Travels of Four Years and a Half in the United States of America (1803), Captain Smith and Princess Pocahontas (1805), and The First Settlers of Virginia (1806) which featured a more sexualized and romanticized characterization of Pocahontas.Much of the known background about the piece comes from a letter Barker wrote to William Dunlop, dated June 10, 1832. In it, he indicates that he had been working on The Indian Princess for a number of years before it was first produced in 1808. In fact in 1805, he wrote a Masque entitled \"America\" (which has not survived) that he intended to serve as a conclusion to the play, in which characters called \"America,\" \"Science,\" and \"Liberty\" sing and engage in political debate.

Based on records of payments made to musicians at The Chestnut Street Theatre at the time of the premiere, it was likely that the production employed approximately 25 pieces, which may have consisted of pairs of woodwinds (flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons) and brasses (horns and trumpets) as well as some timpani and strings. Typically, however, the entire orchestra was used only for the overture and selected large chorus numbers, while solo numbers were accompanied by strings and one or two pairs of woodwinds.

In Barker's letter to Dunlop, he writes the performance was done as a benefit for Mr. Bray (who also played the role of Walter). However, other sources suggest it was a benefit for a Mrs. Woodham. In any case, it is clear that the performance was interrupted by an offstage commotion which may have cut the performance short. Mr. Webster, a tenor who played the role of Larry, was an object of public scorn at the time because of his effeminate manner and dress, and audience members rioted in outrage at his participation, causing Barker himself to order the curtain to be dropped. The play was subsequently performed again in Philadelphia on February 1, 1809, although it was advertised for January 25.There is some discrepancy about the date of the New York premiere, which took place at The Park Theatre, either on June 14, 1808, or on January 14, 1809, as a benefit for English actress Mrs. Lipman. It was performed again in New York as a benefit for Dunlop on June 23, 1809, There was a performance benefiting Bray and an actor named Mr. Cone advertised for August 25, 1808, at The Alexandria Theatre in Virginia. There was also a gala premiere on an unspecified date in Baltimore. Barker wrote in his letter to Dunlop that the play was subsequently and frequently performed in all the theatres across the country.  It was the standard practice in all these productions for the Native American roles to be played by white actors wearing dark makeup.The Indian Princess has been cited as the first well-documented case of a play that was originally performed in America being subsequently staged in England. Although records indicate there was a play called Pocahontas; or the Indian Princess, credited as being adapted by T.A. Cooper, that played The Theatre Royal at Drury Lane in London on December 15, 1820, and subsequently on December 16 and December 19, the piece differed drastically from Barker's original and featured a completely different cast of characters. Barker himself wrote that the production was done without his permission or even his knowledge, and based on a critical response he read of the London performance, he deduced that there was very little in the play that was his own. Other evidence suggests that the script used in England was not only a completely different play, but that it was likely not even originated by an American. This assertion is based primarily on three factors: the kinder and meeker portrayal of the Natives, which reduces the grandeur of the play's American heroes, the more vague listing of the setting as \"North America\" rather than specifically \"Virginia,\" and the lack of implications about America's great destiny that was evident in Barker's version. The distinction between the London and American versions is also supported by a review of the London production, in which the reviewer cites a lack of comic characters (Barker's version included several), and the presence of a character named \"Opechancaough,\" who is nowhere to be found in Barker's play.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the first case, the tragic accident was only discovered much later, when the victim's crypt was reopened. In others, victims revived and were able to draw attention to themselves in time to be freed from their ghastly prisons.\nThe narrator reviews these examples in order to provide context for his nearly crippling phobia of being buried alive. As he explains, his condition made him prone to slipping into a trance state of unconsciousness, a disease that grew progressively worse over time. He became obsessed with the idea that he would fall into such a state while away from home, and that his state would be mistaken for death.

Sited on the island were 11 152mm/6 inch (an intermediate calibre) coastal artillery guns, along with a number of smaller guns.

The heavy radar-controlled guns command the only deepwater channel that ships can use and must be silenced at all costs.\nCommando attacks have failed and after a bombardment by B-24 Liberator bombers fails to destroy the guns, Captain James Jensen RN, Chief of Operations for SOE in Cairo, decides to launch a desperate last-ditch attempt which he has already planned in case the bombing is unsuccessful. He has drawn together a team of specialist saboteurs to infiltrate the island via the \"unclimbable\" south cliff and get into the fortress to destroy the guns. They have less than one week.\nThe team meet for the first time in Alexandria. They comprise:\n\nCaptain Keith Mallory \u2013 a New Zealand officer with the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG).

They demand that he be arrested and held incommunicado, but the story implies that this does not happen.\nIn an ancient ca\u00efque they sail towards Navarone. They carry papers identifying themselves as collaborators with, and couriers for, the German commandant of the island. They are intercepted by a German patrol boat, which appears to be expecting them. They sink it and kill all the crew.\nThey are wrecked in a storm but manage to land on the island, having lost much of their equipment. They climb the 'unclimbable' south cliff, but Stevens slips and is badly injured.\nEvading German guards, they travel through heavy snow and rough terrain and are met by Louki, the steward of the exiled owner of the island, and Panayis, his enigmatic friend. They bring much needed food. By radio, Jensen tells the team that they have less time than was planned for. The ships are coming through that very night. But whilst resting in a cave, they are captured by a troop of German specialist mountain soldiers led by Oberleutnant Turzig, who recognises Mallory as a famous climber. They are taken to the town of Margaritha where they are ruthlessly interrogated by Hauptmann Skoda. Thanks to Andrea's diversionary behaviour, they turn the tables on them and Skoda is shot. With Turzig and the others securely tied up, they escape and make their way to the town of Navarone. They are harassed by troops and planes who are also apparently expecting them.\nWith no medical facilities available, Stevens is clearly dying and beyond help. He asks to be left behind and feels curiously at peace. Miller discovers that much of his equipment has been damaged. Suspicion falls on Panayis, who is also suspected of being a double agent.

The crown's fourteen sonnets form the sequence's third section. The final eight sonnets in the sequence comprise the fourth section, in which Pamphilia returns to a darker, melancholy tone, but understands that her suffering is necessary in order to understand the inner world of human emotion.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27281", "text": "The seventh sonnet in Pamphilia to Amphilanthus supports Wroth's overarching themes of a woman's struggle in 17th century English society. The sonnet introduces female struggle between coercion and consent to a male lover. Bernadette Andrea's \"Pamphilia's Cabinet: Gendered Authorship and Empire in Lady Mary Wroth's Urania\" addresses the reasons why a female character would confront the reality of choosing between coercion and consent. One of the main aspects that Andrea approaches is the limits that the historical context put on the author's freedom of speech. Andrea states, \"She may write, but only from the limits of her own room; she may preserve her writing, but only within the confines of her own mind\". Sonnet 7 is Pamphilia's expression of her own thoughts, emotions and views.\n\nThe power of the patriarchal society on her views is evident. The influence is exemplified in line 6, \"I am thy subject, conquered, bound to stand\". Voicing her situation, Pamphilia feels subjected to male dominance. However, her desires are unclear on this matter because she says, \"behold I yield\", (5) as if a declaration of her choice to the relations with Amphilanthus. The idea of free choice for women would be classified as a protofeminist thought because they were grossly oppressed and not allowed to think for themselves.\n[The following is a misapplication of Mullaney's ideas; or rather, the writer needs to explain how Wroth's work is akin to the ideological functions of the theater which are the actual subject of Mullaney's work]:  Stephen Mullaney provides insight into the reason that Mary Wroth's work survived by stating, \"What comes to reside in a wonder-cabinet are, in the most reified sense of the phrase, strange things: tokens of alien cultures, reduced to the status of sheer objects, stripped of cultural and human contexts in a way that makes them eminently capable of surviving the period that thus produced them\". The social analysis of the survival of the oppressed writings comes from \"Strange Things, Gross Terms, Curious Customs\". The treatment of women caused Pamphilia to question whether she even has a choice in who she loves (consent) or if that is determined by society (coercion). Her inability to differentiate in the poem is probably due to the subjugation of inferior treatment that she has experienced. Mullaney refers to this as being \"reduced to the status of sheer objects\". She is forced to analyze if she is merely an object at the disposal of men. As a result, her ability to analyze, invoke higher level thinking, and even her personhood is examined.\nWroth's representation of female emotions conjured with the interaction with of a male suitor puts expected women's values into action. The sonnet explores the \"obedience\" attribute of what Bernadette Andrea refers to as the \"triple injunction\" of English culture in the 17th century. The \"triple injunction\" concept was communicated through many different forms including: educational tracts, religious sermons, and legal codes. Its purpose was to define the perfect woman as upholding social norms through the values of chastity, obedience, and silence. Pamphilia ends the sonnet resolving to \"obey\" (14) Amphilanthus' \"charms\", (14) regardless of her own wants. Her conclusion to persevere despite her personal feelings speaks to the cultural understanding of women heroism which is equated with endurance. Pamphilia does not concede all hope of having a choice in the relationship, but does wish to avoid physical hurt.The sonnet does make an intriguing reference to Astrophel and Stella: in line 13 of the Petrarchan sonnet, Wroth writes, \"\u2026Sir God, your boyship I despise\". The phrase \"Sir God\" is linked to the late 16th century poem, Astrophel and Stella. Sidney's Astrophel is referred to as \"Sir Foole\". According to Catherine Bates, Astrophel contracts similar difficulty as he, \"is not only overmastered, the willing victim of a superior power, he is also emasculated\". Perpetuating the gender roles of the time, Bates argues that Sidney paints Astrophel, a boy, as feminine. Wroth includes traces of Astrophel and Stella to provide ties to previous gender inequality. Astrophel only experiences the struggle between coercion, \"overmastered\", and consent, \"willing\", because he is cast as feminine. Bates's understanding of downward mobility in social status by moving from male to female through Sydney's Astrophel and Stella is strongly supported by Bernadette Andrea's analysis of social norms. Wroth's echo of Sydney's work is to address the gender issues from a new voice: the female perspective.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He travels to the town of Winthrop after requests from the town council, which has proposed that the town be renamed. However, three key citizens disagree what the name should be: Albie Winthrop, descendant of the town's namesake (who'd made his fortune in barbed wire); Regina Goode, the mayor (descendant of one of the town's two founders); and Lucky Aberdeen, a software magnate who's leading the drive to rename the town.

After repeatedly stubbing his toe and covering it up with Apex bandages, the consultant accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat.

This led to the amputation of his toe, his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.\nAfter much deliberation, the consultant decides on the name \"Struggle\", the original idea of the other of the two original founders, Field.

The series revolves around teenagers who are amateur sleuths, solving cases that stumped their adult counterparts. The characters were created by American writer Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of book packaging firm Stratemeyer Syndicate. The books were written by several ghostwriters, most notably Leslie McFarlane, under the collective pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon.The Hardy Boys have evolved since their debut in 1927. From 1959 to 1973, the first 38 books were extensively revised, largely to remove depictions of ethnic stereotypes; they were also targeted towards younger readers by being rewritten in a simpler, action-oriented style to compete with television.\nA new Hardy Boys series, the Hardy Boys Casefiles, was created in 1987, and featured murders, violence, and international espionage. The original \"Hardy Boys Mystery Stories\" series ended in 2005. A new series, Undercover Brothers, was launched the same year, featuring updated versions of the characters who narrate their adventures in the first person. Undercover Brothers ended in 2012 and was replaced in 2013 by The Hardy Boys Adventures, also narrated in the first person.\nThrough these changes the characters have remained popular; several new volumes are published each year, and the adventures have been translated into over 25 languages. The boys have been featured in five television shows and several video games, and have helped promote merchandise such as lunchboxes and jeans. Critics have many explanations for the characters' longevity, suggesting that the Hardy Boys embody wish fulfillment, American ideals of boyhood and masculinity, a well-respected father paradoxically argued to be inept in the later books, and the possibility of the triumph of good over evil.On January 1, 2023, the original editions of the first three books entered the public domain in the United States.

The author makes a clear distinction between what is written to be seen and/or heard (theater, cinema, television, radio, opera and to a lesser extent comic books) and what is written to be read (literature).\nThe book's principle is the same as Aristotle's Poetics. Yves Lavandier examines works by major scriptwriters and playwrights (Samuel Beckett, Bertolt Brecht, Charles Chaplin, Herg\u00e9, Alfred Hitchcock, Henrik Ibsen, Ernst Lubitsch, Moli\u00e8re, Dino Risi, William Shakespeare, Sophocles, Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, etc.) in order to answer three questions:\n\nwhat do dramatic works consist of?\nwhy is this so?\nhow does one go about writing them?The author scans all the tools of dramatic narrative: conflict, protagonist, obstacles, suspense, characterisation, three-act structure, preparation, dramatic irony, comedy, activity, dialogue. A play written by Moli\u00e8re, The School for Wives, and a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, North by Northwest, are analysed in detail. Several appendices deal with writing for children, drama and literature, short films, documentaries, etc.\nIn the course of pages, Yves Lavandier develops several governing ideas. According to him:\n\nDrama preexists theater and film. Life being full of conflicts and ruled by causality, one can say that life is Aristotelian.\nThe art of narrative can be taught, like every other human activity.\nIt takes two to speak the language of drama: writer and receiver. This is why dramatic irony\u2014which consists in giving the audience an item of information that at least one of the characters is unaware of\u2014is a fundamental mechanism, omnipresent in all genres (tragedy, comedy, melodrama, suspense, thriller, etc.) and all types of narratives.\nAll the great storytellers know the rules of narration, at least unconsciously.\nOne can respect the rules and take the spectator into account while keeping one's liberty and authenticity.\nRules are called \u201crecipes\u201d by those who fear or despise them.\nDrama should not be placed in the same basket as literature, Moli\u00e8re and William Shakespeare beside Gustave Flaubert and Franz Kafka.\nDialogue, in theater or radio, is the visible part of the iceberg. Even in radio, structure and characterisation are paramount.\nTheater is, as well as film, an art of the image.\nTo write a good story, three things are needed: conflict, conflict and conflict.\nThe spectacular and the sensational are cheap ways to generate emotion and often mingle with voyeurism and omnipotence.\nWhen an actor is brilliant, he, of course, deserves all the plaudits he gets. But praise is also due to the director who directed him as well as to the writer who created his role in the first place.\nThe most powerful language of drama is structure, far before dialogue.\nNonetheless, the dialogue is inevitable when one tells a human story, even in silent movies where dialogues were numerous, either written on intertitles or guessed by the audience.\nThe three-act structure (dramatic acts, not logistical ones) relies simply on a universal triad: before-during-after. One can find the three-act structure in the vast majority of dramatic works, including in a narrative as deconstructed as 21 Grams.\nSuspense should not be mistaken with mystery, Alfred Hitchcock with Agatha Christie.\nComedy is a noble, useful and difficult treatment. Its lightness is only an appearance, politeness.\nAs the mockery of human limitations, comedy may be disparaging but also demanding or compassionate.\nThe basics of the narrative are the pattern of a fractal structure.\nTV series are highly respectable and can produce masterpieces of human art such as The Sopranos.\nChildren need good drama. To write for children is a wonderful school of narration.\nWriters of drama will always be indispensable and keep on responding to a triple human need of emotion, meaning and distraction.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27394", "text": "Writing Drama is considered a reference textbook amongst European playwrights and scriptwriters.According to Jacques Audiard, Writing Drama is on par with Aristotle's Poetics.

Despite his limited education, Lapham is a shrewd and hardworking man, an American success story. But he, his wife, and two daughters feel socially awkward compared to other wealthy Bostonians. They decide to build a new home in the fashionable Back Bay neighborhood, and Lapham spares no expense in making it impressive.\nTom Corey, a young man from an \"old money\" Boston family, shows an interest in the Lapham girls, and Mr. and Mrs. Lapham assume he is attracted to Irene, their beautiful younger daughter. Tom joins the Lapham paint business in an attempt to find his place in the world, rather than rely on his wealthy father. Tom introduces Lapham to the cream of Boston society at a dinner party, and they remain on good terms even though the occasion turns out to be embarrassingly awkward.\nAs Tom continues calling on the Laphams regularly, it's assumed that he wants to marry Irene, and she hopes for just such a result. Tom, however, later shocks both families by revealing that he loves Penelope, the older, less glamorous but more intelligent and thoughtful sister. Though Penelope has feelings for Tom, she is held back by the romantic conventions of the era, not wanting to act on her love for fear of betraying her sister.\nMeanwhile, Lapham and his wife Persis sometimes clash over his treatment of people from their less prosperous past. For instance, Lapham is generous to the widow and daughter of his fallen Civil War comrade Jim Millon, feeling that he owes the man his life. He quietly sends money to Millon's widow and gives the daughter a job. When Persis Lapham objects that she thinks the two women are taking advantage of her husband's generosity to the possible detriment of his reputation, Lapham insists he is paying a debt of honor. Persis also faults her husband for distancing himself from his former business partner Milton K. Rogers, who has come down in the world since their association ended, but Lapham insists he has treated Rogers fairly.\nAmid the uproar over the Corey courtship, however, Rogers reappears, asking for money for a series of schemes. Persis convinces her husband to provide the help. Unfortunately, Rogers proves to be a very poor businessman, causing the Laphams' to lose considerable sums. On top of that, Lapham's major asset, his new home on Beacon Street, burns down before its completion due to his own carelessness. However, Lapham turns down the opportunity to salvage his fortunes by participating in a dishonest scheme contrived by Rogers and unscrupulous English investors. Likewise, when a purchaser offers to buy Lapham's paint business, Lapham discloses that the business will fail due to a new competitor, and the purchaser abandons the sale.\nThe Laphams are thus forced to move back to their modest former residence, where the mineral paint was first developed, and, ultimately, the competitor buys the business, with Lapham reduced to the status of employee. The Laphams, though not destitute, are now no longer wealthy. Tom and Penelope are finally able to marry after Irene accepts their romance. The elder Laphams, living in the countryside, are left to reflect on their extraordinary rise and decline.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27404", "text": "Howells had moved to Massachusetts in the 1860s and became influential as the editor of the Atlantic Monthly, a role he held until 1881.

The magazine's editor, Richard Watson Gilder, was concerned about any descriptions of violence, however, especially after recent anarchist activity, and asked Howells to edit a line that was originally as a character noting his desire of \"applying dynamite to those rows of close-shuttered, handsome, brutally insensitive houses\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27405", "text": "Historian Francis Parkman, a contemporary of Howells's, had difficulty understanding the realism of the book.

The queue of the mandarin T'sin Wong has mysteriously vanished while he slept. The maiden Hwa-che seeks to solve the mystery, using the methods she has learned from the crime novels of the Western barbarians. In this she is aided by Chin-tung, the mandarin's male secretary. Initially disguised as a man, she and Chin-tung become increasingly attracted to each other as the story progresses.\nThe story humorously spoofs the conventions of the mystery novel, and contains allusions to well known fictional detectives.

The Pentland family is rich and part of the upper class, but their world is rapidly changing. The old Congregational church the Pentlands long favored has disbanded as more and more WASPs have left Durham, replaced by immigrant Roman Catholics with different religious customs. The Pentlands once ruled upper-class society in Durham. However, upper-class society is changing: Many of the \"old line\" families have either died off or moved away, and many nouveaux riches have moved into the area who do not share the same old-fashioned values and observe the same old-fashioned norms of behavior that the Pentlands do.\nThe patriarch of the family is John Pentland. He lives in Pentland Manor, a large and old-fashioned manor house, with his sister Cassie, a fussy, moralistic, snobbish old maid who is firmly determined to see that the Pentlands uphold the \"old ways.\" Her companion is Miss Peavey, who lacks intelligence but in all other ways is as moralistic and disapproving as Aunt Cassie. John's son and heir Anson married the wealthy but low-status Scotch-Irish girl Olivia. The couple have a son, John (nicknamed \"Jack\"), and a daughter, Sybil. The Pentlands say that they can trace their family heritage to the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and Anson is writing a book about the family. John Pentland's niece Sabine is the black sheep of the family. Her parents died, and her home was lost to creditors. She became Aunt Cassie's ward. However, 20 years ago, she married a poor, low-born man named Callender and fled with him to Europe. John Pentland acts as if he is widowed, but about a quarter of the way through the novel the reader realizes that his wife is not dead. For the past two or three decades, Pentland's wife Agnes has been insane, and she now lives in an upstairs room in a far wing of the house. She is cared for by Miss Egan, a nurse. Every morning, John Pentland visits her and speaks with her despite her insanity. Afterward, he visits Mrs. Soames, a long-time friend of his wife, and plays cards. His attention to the widowed Mrs. Soames is unseemly (so Aunt Cassie says), but no one can criticize him openly because John is the patriarch of the family.\nThe novel is set during the early autumn. Olivia is almost age 40, and she increasingly feels trapped and stifled by her life. She and her husband have a loveless marriage (they have not shared rooms for years), and their son Jack is constantly ill. The novel opens as Olivia's daughter Sybil returns home from a boarding school in Paris. Sabine Callender and her daughter Therese have returned to Durham, and they are spending the summer at Pentland Manor. Therese is a d\u00e9butante, and she is being \"introduced\" to Durham upper-class society. Aunt Cassie and Miss Peavey repeatedly criticize Sabine for being a flapper and for the scandal she brought on the family. Also visiting Durham that fall is Jean, the son of a Frenchman who married an American woman and whom Sybil met in Paris. Sybil is in love with Jean, and she creates scandal by pursuing him relentlessly.\nAlso newly arrived in Durham is Michael O'Hara, an Irish immigrant who has achieved wealth and political prominence in Boston. He bought Sabine's former home, and he is refurbishing it. Aunt Cassie and Miss Peavey are horrified by the arriviste and constantly snub him. Anson is upset by the attentions O'Hara lavishes on his wife and daughter. O'Hara soon tells Sabine that he has fallen in love with Olivia, and Olivia reciprocates. O'Hara says he is willing to sacrifice everything just to love her. Anson Pentland refuses to give Olivia a divorce for fear it will ruin his career and the family's good name.\nSeveral events happen in quick succession: Jack dies, but only Olivia is there to comfort him at the end. Olivia discovers the Pentland groom is having a secret affair with someone in the house. (The reader realizes it is Miss Egan.) The night Jack dies, Olivia runs into a momentarily lucid Mrs. Pentland, who tells her that there is a secret in the attic that could destroy and free the family. She is quickly hushed by Miss Egan, and she soon falls back into muddled incomprehensibility. Sybil marries Jean, and Olivia is convinced her daughter will find the happiness that she never had.\nSeveral secrets are revealed by the end of the novel, which mark the Pentlands as hypocrites. Olivia learns that John Pentland loves Mrs. Soames (whether he has consummated his affair with her is unclear), and he has not divorced his insane wife out of duty. His daily visits with his wife are not performed out of love (as everyone assumes) but out of a desire to divert attention from his affair with Mrs. Soames. Olivia comes to believe that Mrs. Pentland's ravings about a secret in the attic were not madness. She soon discovers a packet of letters that reveals that the Pentland family's ancestor was a bastard child who stole the name from an aristocratic family that had died shortly after arriving in the New World. She suspects that Anson knows the truth and that he is lying about the family in his book.\nJohn Pentland, broken-hearted at the death of his grandson, changes his will and leaves all his money to Olivia. He commits suicide by riding his horse into a deep ravine and falling to his death. Olivia rejects Michael O'Hara's love, realizing that she is the only person strong enough to hold the Pentland family together through the coming years of immense change. John Pentland has given her the chance, through her control of the family fortune, to force the Pentlands to adapt rather than wither like so many other upper-class families have. By leaving with Michael, Olivia believes that she would be taking the easy way out and cheapening herself.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He gets Natalie to rent another newly arrived car. He cuts open the seats, revealing that they are packed with cocaine. Rental cars are being used to smuggle in drugs. The dealers use inside men at the rental agencies to tip them off to which cars have the drugs. They then send out men to wreck, vandalize, or steal the rental vehicles, knowing that seemingly random thefts and accidents involving rental vehicles are not likely to draw police attention. Once in the shop, they switch out the drug loaded seats for emptied seats from the last vehicle. Kealoha acknowledges that one body shop in the town of Kapaa gets most of the body shop work for rental cars.\nMonk and Natalie fly back to San Francisco. Monk and Natalie head to the hotel where Swift is doing a show taping. During the show, Swift claims to be receiving a message from Trudy, and produces information about Trudy's security blanket. Monk shows the letter that he notarized in Hawaii, which claims that the story about Trudy's security blanket is fabricated. He did this to expose Swift as having killed Helen Gruber and Martin Kamakele. Monk reveals that Kamakele had the rooms of the Grand Kiahuna Poipu bugged to help Swift's show, since guests on the show typically stay at the hotel. The scheme worked until Helen complained about hearing voices. Swift knew Helen's hearing aids were picking up transmissions from the bugs in her room. Afraid that she would find out what was going on, he killed Helen while Lance was off snorkeling, then stashed her body in the fridge to mislead police into thinking someone was trying to falsify the time of death. Monk showing up at the hotel, enabling him to create publicity from solving the murder, was just a happy coincidence for Swift. Kamakele figured out what really happened to Helen and attempted to blackmail Swift. Swift beat Kamakele to death, and burned his hand while burying the body, explaining the blister.\nMonk says that Swift's misreading of Trudy proves he cannot speak to the dead, so the only way he could have known details about Helen's murder is if he was the killer. He is convinced that the police will find recording equipment in Swift's bungalow and will test Helen's hearing aids to find they match the frequencies of the recording bugs.

It was recorded and broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 13 November 1962. Patrick Magee played Words and Felix Felton, Croak. Music was composed especially by John S. Beckett. The play first appeared in print in Evergreen Review 6.27 (November\u2013December 1962). Beckett himself translated the work into French under the title Paroles et Musique (Minuit, 1966).\nWhile John Fletcher considered Words and Music the weakest of Beckett's radio plays, Hugh Kenner considered it arguably the most moving work ever done for radio and Vivian Mercier praised it as one of Beckett's most powerful works along with Cascando (1961).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27484", "text": "The play takes place in what Katharine Worth describes as \"an unidentified \u2018listening\u2019 space,\" another of Beckett\u2019s \"skullscapes.\" The only specific location mentioned is \"the tower\" \u2013 perhaps a folly(?) \u2013 so the scene may well be in a castle or similarly large building of some kind with Croak in the role of ch\u00e2telain.\nCroak is a doddery old man, testy and maudlin. He is never referred to by name in the play itself but he is well named. Joe addresses to him \u2013 albeit somewhat obsequiously \u2013 as, \"My Lord,\" since, despite his apparent frailty, he has plainly been someone used to wielding authority. There are only three sound effects used in the entire play, the shuffle [Beckett's descriptive stage direction) of Croak's feet as he arrives and departs, the thud/dropping of his club (staff?) reminiscent of the rulers wielded by the Animator in Rough for Radio II and the music teacher in Embers and the rapping of Music's baton reminiscent of a once prevalent practice among conductors of the past which is now far less widespread. The club and baton function as objects of authority. They form an interesting dyad prominently employed throughout the play.\nFor entertainment, Croak, (a Beckettian \u2018old King Cole\u2019) has only two old stalwarts to call on, his minstrels, Joe (Words) and Bob (Music). Each is heard to be possibly an abstraction and/or a being of some sort manifested through their respective vocabularies (music/words). Do they have actual physical form? This remains an unanswerable question. With radio remaining a solely sonic medium, we can only conjecture (Beckett sets up similar uncertainty in much of his work). Words/Music function in a way resembling court artists/musicians of the past. Word's repeatedly addressing Croak as \"My Lord\" and the strange formality to the domination both Words/Joe and Music/Bob seem accustomed to enduring adds an ancient (medieval?) or primitively regal aspect to the proceedings.\nThe modern shortened names (Joe, Bob) add a humorous contemporary contrast to the generally ancient (or timeless) seeming circumstances. The source of Croak's power over them is never explained or questioned-adding to the mysterious atmosphere.\nAlfred Alvarez refers to Croak as \"a poet\" though there is no real evidence to suggest that he is. In fact his utterances throughout the play are terse: moans, groans and murmurings mainly along with a few short lines (commands, entreaties or outbursts). That said, he appears to appreciate poetry especially when set to music. The first theme Croak proclaims for the evening's diversion is \"Love.\" Beckett offers several clues to help imagine Croak as a specific character. His shuffling feet, choice of themes, self-torturing reminiscence and intense reactions to much of what Words and Music produce/perform all seem to indicate that he is a decrepit version of Orsino with his famous opening line from Twelfth Night: \"If music be the food of love, play on,\" a hopeless romantic, in love with love, and the melancholy brought on by the mere thought of it. Croak could almost be the selfsame man, had he never moved from that spot for the rest of his life and now finds himself perhaps approaching the brink of death. Or does this gathering occur again and again outside time? So many Beckett works present characters seemingly caught in endless cycles of repetition (those who wait in \"Waiting for Godot\"/the appearing-disappearing woman in \"Ill Seen Ill Said\"/The urn-dwelling trio in \"Play\" etc.) that this is always a possibility.\nAdditional related aspects of Love that Croak focuses on as sub-themes are \"Age,\" \"Face,\" (With two foreshadowing mentions earlier on in the play-once by Croak and then latter by Words) and the climactic naming of \"Lily\" which is discussed later regarding its various implications. After this iteration Croak is reduced to groans, an anguished \"No!\" and the eventual dropping of his \"club\" followed by shuffling away. His entrance/exit frames the main body of the play.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27485", "text": "Various readings of what the situation in Words and Music might represent have emerged from critical studies of the work:\n\nVivian Mercier treats the three characters as separate beings, Croak being an \"old man who shuffles in\" asking Words and Music to be friends.\nEugene Webb suggests that \"Croak is the name the dialogue directions give to the conscious self of the artist\".\nCharles Lyons says that \"[i]n Words and Music Beckett provides three characters who seem to represent different psychic functions of a single consciousness \u2026 [however] Beckett does not integrate them into the image of a specific, whole person.\" Also a number of times Lyons hints at the autobiographical nature of the piece though without providing any real evidence. It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is known that almost everyone who was involved in the LOOP project has died of the same cancer.\nKaoru takes a part-time job tutoring a boy named Ryoji, who is an asymptomatic carrier of MHC along with his mother, Reiko.

By doing so, he could create a clone and insert him into a woman's womb. But what they forgot is that Ryuji's clone would carry the Ring Virus with his genes. Therefore, when Ryuji was reborn, the virus escaped and mutated into the MHC virus.\nDesperate to find the cure for the MHC virus, Kaoru ventures deeper west into the desert only to encounter a storm that leaves him on the verge of death. He is then saved by an old man named Eliot who has purposefully crafted all the events to bring Kaoru to him.

The fictional story is set on the Isle of Man and is concerned with Victor Stowell, the Deemster's son, who commits a romantic indiscretion and then gives up on all of his principles in order to keep it a secret. However, in the face of the mounting consequences, Victor confesses publicly to his crime and is punished, but redemption comes through a woman's love. The penultimate of Caine's novels, it is romantic and moralistic, returning to his regular themes of sin, justice and atonement, whilst also addressing \"the woman question.\" It was adapted for a film entitled Name the Man in 1924 by Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27528", "text": "The central idea for the plot of The Master of Man came from a correspondence which Hall Caine had in September 1908. Following a performance of the theatrical version of his earlier novel, The Christian, Caine was identified as a likely signatory in a petition against the harsh punishment of a woman named Daisy Lord. After giving birth to a child out of wedlock the young woman had killed the child secretly but was discovered and arrested. At the trial she explained that \"I thought I would put an end to it so that it should not have the trouble I have had.\" Caine signed the petition but he kept the accompanying letter as a record of its story.\nIn writing about the novel for promotional purposes, however, Caine makes no mention of this English case of Daisy Lord. Instead, he attributed his inspiration to a vague story from Manx legal history:\n\nThere was [a] judicial scandal in the Isle of Man, which [...] somehow entered into the region of the heroic, partly by reason of the part played in it by a great and noble woman. That was the scandal whereof the main features form the groundwork of the following story - the story of a sin, perhaps a little or at least a natural and pardonable sin, which, being concealed and denied at the beginning, went on and on from consequence to consequence (as all hidden sins must), increasing like a snowball in weight and momentum until it was in danger of submerging with an avalanche the entire community.\n\nDescribed as a Roman \u00e0 clef by Caine's modern biographer, the novel also used many themes and occurrences from Caine's own life. One notable instance of this is the episode where Bessie is sent away to be educated before she would be fit to marry the educated and higher-class Victor Stowell, which clearly recalls Caine's having set up Mary Chandler in Sevenoaks in order to be educated before their own marriage. As was usual in Caine's work, he makes no acknowledgement of his main sources, instead writing that \"while the principal incidents of the tale I have now to tell owe something to reminiscence, I have exercised so freely the storyteller's licence in telling them [...] that I can claim no better authority for my story than that of an independent creation, with a general background of fact.\"Caine first spoke of his ideas for the novel to Bram Stoker in 1912 shortly before his death. Although Caine then began work on the novel in 1913, he put it aside in order to concentrate on writing in support of the Allies during World War I, apparently not picking it up again until one day after the Armistice, on 12 November 1918. By the autumn of 1919 the book had begun to appear in serial form in magazines in America and in the UK, although the episodes had to be later interrupted and held back due to problems with Caine's health and personal life (through strain on his marriage and also at the death of his publisher, William Heinemann). After working on the novel in St. Moritz, the Savoy Hotel in London and at his home, Greeba Castle, in the Isle of Man, the book was completed and ready for publishing in book form in July 1921.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27529", "text": "Whilst writing the book, Caine gave it the working title of The Manx Woman. He was convinced to change the title at the suggestion of his agent at Heinemann, Charly Evans, who wrote: \"I am convinced that the title The Master of Man has a ring to it like the chimes of Big Ben - something that stirs one to the utmost, and arouses every element of curiosity.\"Towards the end of its serialisation in magazines, a draft version of the completed book was sent to various friends, critics and public figures to obtain their responses for use in promotional material for the book. His good friend, Robert Leighton, responded emphatically, calling the book \"your supreme achievement\u2026 the greatest and most perfect thing you have done. It seems to me you know human nature with absolute success.\" However, the majority of those who received the book sent acknowledgements that were merely brief and polite. The most flattering extracts from these letters were included at the back of a limited edition of 100 copies of the book that were presented to Caine's family and friends.The book went on sale in July 1921 with an initial printing of 100,000 copies, announced in the Manx press as \"to be immediately made available for the vast English holiday crowd that sets out on its annual vacation about the last week of July.\" The entirety of this print run sold out within a matter of days and the book immediately topped the best-seller list. However, Caine was bemused and annoyed to find that it held the top-selling spot for only for a short space of time.The book was published in twelve translations in fifteen countries simultaneously with the British edition; in Australia, Bohemia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden and the United States. Unlike previous Caine novels, this book failed to reach the top-selling spot in the United States, where the highest place it reached was third.Quotes from the press reaction to the novel, included in later editions of the book, were remarkable for drawing comparisons between Caine and Tolstoy:\n\"A great novel. Will stand as the English Anna Karenina.\" (The Daily Graphic)\n\"Sir Hall Caine in The Master of Man has shown himself to be the English Tolstoy.\" (J. Cuming Walters in the Manchester City News)\n\"It places him to the same rank, as a great world novelist, with Zola, Hugo and Tolstoy.\" (Leeds Mercury)However, the general critical response was less positive. In the 27 years since Caine's great success of The Manxman, literary tastes had moved on and his didactic and melodramatic style was now distinctly out of fashion. This was put starkly in a review in The North American Review, where it was noted that \"the sentiment aroused by the story depends in large measure upon an arbitrary and unreal contrast between Stowell's character and the things he does and suffers,\" and that \"the novel as a whole is condemned by its sham inevitableness and its reckless idealizations.\" Caine's modern biographer observes that even just the central plot point of Victor Stowell becoming Deemster \"seems so unlikely as to vitiate the story at its central point.\"Coming ten years before his death, during which time only The Woman of Knockaloe was published, this novel is considered to \"effectively round off the Hall Caine canon.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27530", "text": "As for previous Hall Caine novels, a play adaptation was planned.

He was a lawyer who managed the assets of the Austrian nobility and church. He was arrested by the Gestapo, who hoped to extract information from Dr B. in order to steal the assets. The Gestapo kept Dr B. imprisoned in a hotel, in total isolation, but Dr B. maintained his sanity by stealing a book of past masters' chess games, which he learned completely. After absorbing every single move in the book, he began to play against himself, developing the ability to separate his psyche into two personas. He spent more and more time pacing up and down his cell, mentally playing chess games. This behavior became more and more obsessive and frantic, as he gradually was losing contact with reality. At some point, he accidentally wounded himself and was carried to a hospital. A sympathetic physician, knowing of his situation, attested his insanity to keep him from being imprisoned again by the Nazis, and he was freed.

In a stunning demonstration of his imaginative and combinational powers, Dr B. beats the world champion. Czentovic suggests another game to restore his honour, and Dr B. immediately agrees. But this time, having sensed that Dr B. was impatient when it took too long to move, Czentovic tries to irritate his opponent by taking several minutes to make each move, thereby putting psychological pressure on Dr B., who gets more and more agitated as the game proceeds. He begins to walk around the room between moves, as in a trance, rehearsing imagined matches against himself repeatedly and manically.

The book made a major impact on Norman Podhoretz, who compared the pleasure of reading it to that of reading a great poem or novel.The book has also attracted criticism, among them a piece in the Times Literary Supplement in 2009 by University of Chicago Professor Bernard Wasserstein. Wasserstein cited Arendt's systematic internalization of the various anti-Semitic and Nazi sources and books she was familiar with, which led to the use of many of these sources as authorities in the book. On the other hand, Gershom Scholem criticized Eichmann in Jerusalem but still praised the Origins of Totalitarianism. In several other places, Scholem mentions that he learned from Ernst Bloch that much Jewish literature and testimony in respect of some historical periods is not available due to pogroms, leaving antisemitic sources as the only surviving references for those periods.The historian Emmanuelle Saada disputes Arendt's work and the general scholarly consensus that the rise of scientific racism directly correlates with the rise of colonialist imperialism. Saada contests that there is little evidence to support that ideas like those of Arthur de Gobineau, whom Arendt explicitly mentions, hold an important place in the scientific justification of European colonialism. Saada asserts that Arendt overemphasizes the role of scientific racism in forming modern totalitarianism, but in reality, Arendt should attribute blame to the \"bureaucratic racism\" she discusses elsewhere in the text.Such scholars as J\u00fcrgen Habermas have supported Arendt in her 20th-century criticism of totalitarian readings of Marxism. That commentary on Marxism has indicated concerns with the limits of totalitarian perspectives often associated with Marx's apparent over-estimation of the emancipatory potential of the forces of production. Habermas extends that critique in his writings on functional reductionism in the life-world in his Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason.Historian John Lukacs was highly critical calling it a \"flawed and dishonest book\" with \"unhistorical and shrilly verbose\" and that Arendt coverage of the Soviet Union was superficial.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The work is a critique and revision of the philosopher John Rawls's A Theory of Justice (1971).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27582", "text": "The book is principally a critique and revision of John Rawls's basic ideas in A Theory of Justice (1971). Sen drew extensively upon Rawls's work, mostly composed while the former was a professor in India. Sen was not a student of Rawls. Rather, Rawls\u2014who was not an economist\u2014drew upon the work of Harsanyi and Sen. Sen dedicated The Idea of Justice to the memory of Rawls. In summarizing the work, S.R. Osmani writes;\n\nDo we need a theory of justice at all? if the answer is yes, How should we develop such a theory that could help practical people to move towards a more just world? These are main concerns of Amartya Sen in this book.\nIn the book, Sen makes a radical break with the traditional notion of homo economicus, or 'rational economic man' as motivated mainly by self-interest. He points out that children have strong notions of fairness and acute aversion to manifest injustice. In his introduction to The Idea of Justice, Sen states that \"the strong perception of manifest injustice applies to adult human beings as well (as children). What moves us, reasonably enough, is not the realization that the world falls short of being completely just \u2013 which few of us expect \u2013 but that there are clearly remediable injustices around us which we want to eliminate.\"\nThus, Sen asserts that Human Beings are as concerned with eliminating remediable injustice as they are with pursuing their own self-interest.\nThis assertion has a natural corollary. Since human beings have an innate desire to eliminate injustice where possible, institutions are not that important. Ideal institutions are not required to inculcate a sense of fairness or to persuade people to act fairly or to very strictly police them so as to prevent transgressive behaviour. Since ideal institutions aren't necessary and since people have an innate desire to eliminate remediable injustice, it follows that 'Public Reason'\u2014i.e., open discussion and rational argument\u2014can enable what Sen calls 'plural grounding', this being an 'overlapping consensus' (in Rawls's terminology) between people of different ideologies or belief or value systems such that people can agree upon comparative evaluations regarding justice without having to agree about all their values and beliefs.\nOne of Sen's main arguments is that the project of social justice should not be evaluated in binary terms, as either achieved or not. Rather, he claims that justice should be understood as existing to a matter of degree, and should correspondingly be evaluated along a continuum. Furthermore, he argues that we do not need a fully established abstract ideal of justice to evaluate the fairness of different institutions. He claims that we can meaningfully compare the level of justice in two institutions without positing an ideal, transcendental idea of justice. He names the opposite position transcendental institutionalism.\nSen defends one of Rawls's most fundamental theoretical concepts: justice as fairness. Although this is a vague notion fraught with difficulties in any particular case, he nevertheless views it as one of Rawls's strongest insights while rejecting the necessity of Rawls's two principles of justice emerging from the original position thought experiment in A Theory of Justice.\nHe credits Rawls for revitalizing the interest in the ideas of what justice means and the stress put on fairness, objectivity, equality of opportunity, removal of poverty, and freedom. However, Sen, as part of his general critique of the contractarian tradition, states that ideas about a perfectly just world do not help redress actual existing inequality. Sen faults Rawls for overemphasizing institutions as guarantors of justice and not considering the effects of human behaviour on the institutions' ability to maintain a just society. Sen believes Rawls understates the difficulty in getting everyone in society to adhere to the norms of a just society. He also claims that Rawls' position that there be only one possible outcome of the reflective equilibrium behind the veil of ignorance is misguided. In contrast to Rawls, Sen believes that multiple conflicting, yet just, principles may arise and that this undermines the multistep processes that Rawls laid out as leading to a perfectly just society.Sen also draws heavily on Adam Smith and his first major work The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), arguing that it is Smith's most important and unduly overlooked work.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27583", "text": "The Idea of Justice has been described by The Economist as a \"commanding summation of Mr Sen\u2019s own work on economic reasoning and on the elements and measurement of human well-being\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Before separating, the group discovers that Alice's murderers were psychically compelled into suicide for touching an untouchable.\nClay sets off alone, but the others soon reappear driving a small school bus; the phoners have used their psychic powers to force them to rejoin him. A flock-killer, construction worker Ray Huizenga, gives Clay a cell phone and a phone number, telling him to use them when the time is right; Ray then commits suicide. The group arrives at Kashwak, the site of a half-assembled county fair, where increasing numbers of phoners begin behaving erratically and break from the flock. Jordan theorizes that a program caused the Pulse and that, while it is still broadcasting into the cell phone network, it is corrupted with a computer worm that has infected the newer phoners with a mutated Pulse. Nevertheless, an army of phoners is waiting for them, and Sharon is among them. The phoners lock the group in the fair's exhibition hall for the night; the following morning their execution will be psychically broadcast across the world.\nWhile awaiting their execution, Clay realizes Ray filled the bus with explosives and killed himself to prevent the flock from telepathically discovering them. Jordan drives the vehicle into the inert phoners. Thanks to a jury-rigged cell phone patch set up by the pre-Pulse fair workers, Clay detonates the bomb, wiping out the Raggedy Man and his flock.\nThe majority of the group heads into Canada, to let the approaching winter wipe out the region's unprotected and leaderless phoners. Clay heads south, seeking his son. He finds Johnny, who received a \"corrupted\" Pulse; he wandered away from Kashwak and seems to almost recognize his father.

Cradon had served as intelligence officer with the squadron. in December 1946 Cradon was approached and agreed but his services were rejected by the RAF as senior officers questioned his commitment since, during the war, he had been too interested in flying on practice flights rather than attending to his duties.Nerney then discussed the issue with John Pudney, who was an editor at News Review. Pudney had liked Paul Brickhill's book of World War II escape attempts Escape to Danger (which he had co-authored with Conrad Norton) and was at the time attempting to turn it into a series for BBC TV.Following up Pudney's recommendation, Nerney approached Brickhill in February 1949, who jumped at the offer. As an officer and a pilot in the RAF and a proven writer and journalist Brickhill was acceptable provided he could obtain written confirmation from the RAAF of his service with the RAF. Eventually this was received in March 1949.While doing all it could to assist his research the Air Ministry could only provided Brickhill with a small honorarium, and no guarantee of publication other than as a government produced publication. In an attempt to obtain an advance which would pay enough for him to leave his current job as a sub-editor at The Sun newspaper in Sydney, Australia and relocate to England Brickhill approached a number of Australian publishers to see if they were interested in an Australian edition of the book.

It also mentions Vidura and his death.2. Putradarsana Parva (Chapters: 29\u201336)\nThis sub-book recites the visit of Pandavas to meet Kunti, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari at the hermitage. In the forest on the request of Gandhari, Kunti & other women, sage Vyasa with his powers, resurrect the dead warriors of Kurukshetra war for one night.3. Naradagamana Parva (Chapters: 37\u201339)\nThis sub-book describes the death of Kunti, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari. Narada visits to console those in grief. Yudhishthira performs cremation rites for all of them.The parva describes the 15 year rule by Pandavas with Yudhishthira as the king. Yudhishthira commanded his brothers to cause no grief to Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, who had lost all their hundred sons. Bhima alone however could not forgive the evil that his cousins had done, and his servitors disregarded Dhritarashtra's wishes. Once, the angry Vrikodara harshly reminded the old man how he had dispatched all his mighty sons to the other worlds. Hearing these words, Dhritarashtra gave way to cheerlessness and sorrow. After fifteen years Dhritarashtra and his wife sought the king's permission to take sannyasa (renunciation of domestic life for moksha). Yudhishthira initially disagreed but was persuaded otherwise by Vyasa. \nBefore leaving for the forest Dhritarashtra dispatched Vidura to the king, asking for the means to perform a \u015br\u0101ddha for the deceased Kurus. While Yudhishthira and Arjuna accepted the request, Bhima was enraged. Following the performance of the rites, Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti left for the forest. Sanjaya and Vidura joined them in Vyasa's hermitage. \nOne year later the Pandavas went to meet with them. On seeking Vidura, Yudhishthira found him performing rigorous tapasya deep in the forest; without his uttering a word,  energy left Vidura's body and entered that of Yudhishthira, after which Vidura fell dead. When he tried to cremate the corpse an invisible voice prevented the king from doing so. Vyasa then told him how Vidura was an incarnation of Dharma, the god of righteousness, born in the mortal world through the curse of Mandavya. \nVyasa understanding the sorrow of Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti offered them a glimpse of their sons and relatives who died at Kurukshetra. The  spirits of the slain then rose from the waters of the Bhagirathi, with Vyasa offering the blind Dhritarashtra celestial vision for beholding those heroes. The five Pandavas met Karna, Abhimanyu, and the sons of Draupadi. After some time that large ghostly host disappeared and went to their respective regions. \nOn hearing the story the sceptical Janamejaya asked Vyasa to prove the veracity of the tale, upon which Vyasa summoned Parikshit. The Pandavas, at Dhritarashtra's own request, then returned to Hastinapura.\nTwo years later, Narada informed Yudhishthira that Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti had willingly perished in a forest-fire, after ordering Sanjaya to escape. Narada consoled the grieving Pandavas by telling that their aged relatives had found peace in the abodes of the gods. Yudhishthira then performed their \u015bhraddha.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27618", "text": "Ashramvasik Parva was composed in Sanskrit.

The first principle, what was sentiment in Art, was revealed to him by the discovery of some little book inscribed Gott - Liebe ('Dieu et Amour', God and Love): to have loved and to have prayed.\nThen he became preoccupied by what constituted idea in Art, and, having studied nature and the works of man through thirty years, at the cost of his youth, he wondered if the second principle, that of idea, might be Satan. After a night of storm and colic in the church of Notre-Dame of Dijon, in which clarity shone through the shadows ('Une clart\u00e9 piqua les t\u00e9n\u00e8bres'), he concluded that the devil did not exist, that Art existed in the bosom of God, and that we are merely the copyists of the Creator.\nThen the old stranger thrusts into the poet's hand the book, his own manuscript, telling all the attempts of his lips to find the instrument which gives the pure and expressive note - every trial upon the canvas before the subtle dawn-glow of the 'clair-obscur' or clarity in shadow appeared there - the novel experiments of harmony and colour, the only products of his nocturnal deliberations.

Gaspard de la Nuit, to which the answer is that he is probably in Hell unless he is out on his travels - for he is, of course, the devil. 'May he roast there!' says the poet. 'I shall publish his book.'\nA short preface attributed to Gaspard himself explains that the artists Paul Rembrandt [sic] and Jacques Callot represent two eternally reverse or antithetic faces of Art: one the philosopher absorbed in meditation and prayer upon the spirits of beauty, science, wisdom and love, seeking to penetrate the symbols of nature, and the other the showy figure who parades about the street, rows in the taverns, caresses bohemian girls, always swears by his rapier, and whose main preoccupation is waxing his moustache. But in considering Art under this double personification he has included studies upon other artists among his poetic meditations, which he has not presented as a formal literary theory because M. S\u00e9raphin has not explained to him the mechanism of his Chinese shadow-plays, and Punchinello conceals from curious viewers the thread which makes his arm move.\nThe Fantaisies of Gaspard de la Nuit, each of a few short paragraphs or extended strophes (and every one of them prefaced by a short literary quotation), are then arranged in six short books entitled 'Ecole Flamande' (Flemish School) (9 pieces), 'Le Vieux Paris' (Old Paris) (10), 'La Nuit et ses Prestiges' (The Night and its Marvels) (11), 'Les Chroniques' (The Chronicles) (8), 'Espagne et Italie' (Spain and Italy) (8), and 'Silves' (6).

They had produced Robertson's plays Society in 1865 and Ours in 1866.

Different members of the group reacted in different ways.  Many of those with the highest levels of belief, commitment and social support became more committed to their beliefs, began to court publicity in a way they had not before, and developed various rationalizations for the absence of the flood.

{"id": "50_606", "question": "Who is the author of Watchmen?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27699", "text": "Watchmen is a comic book limited series by the British creative team of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons and colorist John Higgins. It was published monthly by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987 before being collected in a single-volume edition in 1987. Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead.\nMoore used the story as a means of reflecting contemporary anxieties, of deconstructing and satirizing the superhero concept and of making political commentary. Watchmen depicts an alternate history in which superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal was never exposed. In 1985 the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the protagonists' personal development and moral struggles as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement.\nGibbons uses a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and adds recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, which one of the characters reads. Structured at times as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogues have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence, and repeated imagery.\nA commercial success, Watchmen has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press. Watchmen was recognized in Time's List of the 100 Best Novels as one of the best English language novels published since 1923. In a retrospective review, the BBC's Nicholas Barber described it as \"the moment comic books grew up\". Moore opposed this idea, stating, \"I tend to think that, no, comics hadn't grown up. There were a few titles that were more adult than people were used to. But the majority of comics titles were pretty much the same as they'd ever been. It wasn't comics growing up. I think it was more comics meeting the emotional age of the audience coming the other way.\"After a number of attempts to adapt the series into a feature film, director Zack Snyder's Watchmen was released in 2009. A video game series, Watchmen: The End Is Nigh, was released to coincide with the film's release.\nDC Comics published Before Watchmen, a series of nine prequel miniseries, in 2012, and Doomsday Clock, a 12-issue limited series and sequel to the original Watchmen series, from 2017 to 2019 \u2013 both without Moore's or Gibbons' involvement. The second series integrated the Watchmen characters within the DC Universe. A standalone sequel, Rorschach by Tom King, began publication in October 2020. A television continuation to the original comic, set 34 years after the comic's timeline, was broadcast on HBO from October to December 2019 with Gibbons' involvement. Moore has expressed his displeasure with adaptations and sequels of Watchmen and asked it not be used for future works.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27700", "text": "Watchmen, created by writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons, first appeared in the 1985 issue of DC Spotlight, the 50th anniversary special.

In February 1988, DC published a limited-edition, slipcased hardcover volume, produced by Graphitti Design, that contained 48 pages of bonus material, including the original proposal and concept art. In 2005, DC released Absolute Watchmen, an oversized slipcased hardcover edition of the series in DC's Absolute Edition format. Assembled under the supervision of Dave Gibbons, Absolute Watchmen included the Graphitti materials, as well as restored and recolored art by John Higgins. That December DC published a new printing of Watchmen issue #1 at the original 1986 cover price of $1.50 as part of its \"Millennium Edition\" line.In 2012, DC published Before Watchmen, a series of nine prequel miniseries, with various creative teams producing the characters' early adventures set before the events of the original series.In the 2016 one-shot DC Universe: Rebirth Special, numerous symbols and visual references to Watchmen, such as the blood-splattered smiley face, and the dialogue between Doctor Manhattan and Ozymandias in the last issue of Watchmen, are shown.

During that period, writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp, as he had done in his Miracleman series in the early 1980s. Moore reasoned that MLJ Comics' Mighty Crusaders might be available for such a project, so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of the Shield in a harbor. The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used, as long as readers recognized them \"so it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was\". Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled Who Killed the Peacemaker, and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor Dick Giordano. Giordano was receptive to the proposal, but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story. After the acquisition of Charlton's Action Hero line, DC intended to use their upcoming Crisis on Infinite Earths event to fold them into their mainstream superhero universe. Moore said, \"DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional.\" Instead, Giordano persuaded Moore to continue his project but with new characters that simply resembled the Charlton heroes. Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for readers but later changed his mind. He said, \"Eventually, I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough, so that they seemed familiar in certain ways, certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super-hero resonance or familiarity to the reader, then it might work.\"\n\nArtist Dave Gibbons, who had collaborated with Moore on previous projects, recalled that he \"must have heard on the grapevine that he was doing a treatment for a new miniseries. I rang Alan up, saying I'd like to be involved with what he was doing\", and Moore sent him the story outline. Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved. Gibbons brought colorist John Higgins onto the project because he liked his \"unusual\" style; Higgins lived near the artist, which allowed the two to \"discuss [the art] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean\". Len Wein joined the project as its editor, while Giordano stayed on to oversee it. Both Wein and Giordano stood back and \"got out of their way\", as Giordano remarked later. \"Who copy-edits Alan Moore, for God's sake?\"After receiving the go-ahead to work on the project, Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter's house creating characters, crafting details for the story's milieu and discussing influences. The pair were particularly influenced by a Mad parody of Superman named \"Superduperman\"; Moore said: \"We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees\u2014dramatic, instead of comedic\". Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take \"familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm\"; Moore said his intention was to create \"a superhero Moby Dick; something that had that sort of weight, that sort of density\". Moore came up with the character names and descriptions but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons. Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately, but rather \"did it at odd times [...] spend[ing] maybe two or three weeks just doing sketches.\" Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw; Rorschach was his favorite to draw because \"you just have to draw a hat. If you can draw a hat, then you've drawn Rorschach, you just draw kind of a shape for his face and put some black blobs on it and you're done.\"Moore began writing the series very early on, hoping to avoid publication delays such as those faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue Moore said he realized \"I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!\" His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that \"[t]he script for the first issue of Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript\u2014single-spaced\u2014with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages.\" Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page \"in case I drop them on the floor, because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order\", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, \"It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper.\" Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note \"If that doesn't work for you, do what works best\"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested one single change to the script - a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach - as he felt that the dialogue was too long to fit with the length of the action; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons had a great deal of autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.Despite his intentions, Moore admitted in November 1986 that there were likely to be delays, stating that he was, with issue five on the stands, still writing issue nine. Gibbons mentioned that a major factor in the delays was the \"piecemeal way\" in which he received Moore's scripts. Gibbons said the team's pace slowed around the fourth issue; from that point onward the two undertook their work \"just several pages at a time. I'll get three pages of script from Alan and draw it and then toward the end, call him up and say, 'Feed me!' And he'll send another two or three pages or maybe one page or sometimes six pages.\" As the creators began to hit deadlines, Moore would hire a taxi driver to drive 50 miles and deliver scripts to Gibbons. On later issues the artist even had his wife and son draw panel grids on pages to help save time.Near the end of the project, Moore realized that the story bore some similarity to \"The Architects of Fear\", an episode of The Outer Limits television series. The writer and Wein (an editor) argued over changing the ending and when Moore refused to give in, Wein quit the book. Wein explained, \"I kept telling him, 'Be more original, Alan, you've got the capability, do something different, not something that's already been done!' And he didn't seem to care enough to do that.\" Moore acknowledged the Outer Limits episode by referencing it in the series' last issue.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27702", "text": "With Watchmen, Alan Moore's intention was to create four or five \"radically opposing ways\" to perceive the world and to give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible. Moore did not believe in the notion of \"[cramming] regurgitated morals\" down the readers' throats and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light. Moore said, \"What we wanted to do was show all of these people, warts and all. Show that even the worst of them had something going for them, and even the best of them had their flaws.\"\nAdrian Veidt / Ozymandias\nDrawing inspiration from Alexander the Great, Veidt was once the superhero Ozymandias, but has since retired to devote his attention to the running of his own enterprises. Veidt is believed to be the smartest man on the planet. Ozymandias was based on Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt; Moore liked the idea of a character who \"us[ed] the full 100% of his brain\" and \"[had] complete physical and mental control\". Richard Reynolds noted that by taking initiative to \"help the world\", Veidt displays a trait normally attributed to villains in superhero stories, and in a sense he is the \"villain\" of the series. Gibbons noted, \"One of the worst of his sins [is] kind of looking down on the rest of humanity, scorning the rest of humanity.\"\nDaniel Dreiberg / Nite Owl II\nA retired superhero who utilizes owl-themed gadgets. Nite Owl was based on the Ted Kord version of the Blue Beetle. Paralleling the way Ted Kord had a predecessor, Moore also incorporated an earlier adventurer who used the name \"Nite Owl\", the retired crime fighter Hollis Mason, into Watchmen. While Moore devised character notes for Gibbons to work from, the artist provided a name and a costume design for Hollis Mason he had created when he was twelve. Richard Reynolds noted in Super Heroes: A Modern Mythology that despite the character's Charlton roots, Nite Owl's modus operandi has more in common with the DC Comics character Batman. According to Klock, his civilian form \"visually suggests an impotent, middle-aged Clark Kent.\"\nEdward Blake / The Comedian\nOne of two government-sanctioned heroes (along with Doctor Manhattan) who remains active after the Keene Act is passed in 1977 to ban superheroes. His murder, which occurs shortly before the first chapter begins, sets the plot of Watchmen in motion. The character appears throughout the story in flashbacks and aspects of his personality are revealed by other characters. The Comedian was based on the Charlton Comics character Peacemaker, with elements of the Marvel Comics spy character Nick Fury added. Moore and Gibbons saw The Comedian as \"a kind of Gordon Liddy character, only a much bigger, tougher guy\". Richard Reynolds described The Comedian as \"ruthless, cynical, and nihilistic, and yet capable of deeper insights than the others into the role of the costumed hero.\"\nDr. Jon Osterman / Doctor Manhattan\nA superpowered being who is contracted by the United States government. Scientist Jon Osterman gained power over matter when he was caught in an \"Intrinsic Field Subtractor\" in 1959. Doctor Manhattan was based upon Charlton's Captain Atom, who in Moore's original proposal was surrounded by the shadow of nuclear threat. Captain Atom was the only hero with actual superpowers in Dick Giordano's Action Hero line at Charlton, just like Manhattan is the only character with actual superpowers in Watchmen. However, the writer found he could do more with Manhattan as a \"kind of a quantum super-hero\" than he could have with Captain Atom. In contrast to other superheroes who lacked scientific exploration of their origins, Moore sought to delve into nuclear physics and quantum physics in constructing the character of Dr. Manhattan. The writer believed that a character living in a quantum universe would not perceive time with a linear perspective, which would influence the character's perception of human affairs. Moore also wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like Spock from Star Trek, so he sought for Dr. Manhattan to retain \"human habits\" and to grow away from them and humanity in general. Gibbons had created the blue character Rogue Trooper and explained he reused the blue skin motif for Doctor Manhattan as it visualised electrical or atomic energy while still resembling human skin tonally and \"reading as Jon Osterman's skin would've read, but in a different hue.\" Moore incorporated the color into the story, and Gibbons noted the rest of the comic's color scheme made Manhattan unique. Moore recalled that he was unsure if DC would allow the creators to depict the character as fully nude, which partially influenced how they portrayed the character. Gibbons wanted to be tasteful in depicting Manhattan's nudity, selecting carefully when full frontal shots would occur and giving him \"understated\" genitals\u2014like a classical sculpture\u2014so the reader would not initially notice it.\nLaurie Juspeczyk / Silk Spectre II\nThe daughter of Sally Jupiter (the first Silk Spectre, with whom she has a strained relationship) and The Comedian. Of Polish heritage, she had been the lover of Doctor Manhattan for years. While Silk Spectre was originally supposed to be the Charlton superheroine Nightshade, Moore was not particularly interested in that character. Once the idea of using Charlton characters was abandoned, Moore drew more from heroines such as Black Canary and Phantom Lady.\nWalter Joseph Kovacs / Rorschach\nA vigilante who wears a white mask that contains a symmetrical but constantly shifting ink blot pattern, he continues to fight crime in spite of his outlaw status. Moore said he was trying to \"come up with this quintessential Steve Ditko character\u2014someone who's got a funny name, whose surname begins with a 'K,' who's got an oddly designed mask\". Moore based Rorschach on Ditko's creation Mr. A; Ditko's Charlton character The Question also served as a template for creating Rorschach. Comics historian Bradford W. Wright described the character's world view \"a set of black-and-white values that take many shapes but never mix into shades of gray, similar to the ink blot tests of his namesake\". Rorschach sees existence as random and, according to Wright, this viewpoint leaves the character \"free to 'scrawl [his] own design' on a 'morally blank world'\". Moore said he did not foresee the death of Rorschach until the fourth issue when he realized that his refusal to compromise would result in him not surviving the story.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27703", "text": "Moore and Gibbons designed Watchmen to showcase the unique qualities of the comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths. In a 1986 interview, Moore said, \"What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating\", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that Watchmen was designed to be read \"four or five times\", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings. Dave Gibbons notes that, \"[a]s it progressed, Watchmen became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a macguffin, a gimmick ... So really the plot itself is of no great consequence ... it just really isn't the most interesting thing about Watchmen. As we actually came to tell the tale, that's where the real creativity came in.\"Gibbons said he deliberately constructed the visual look of Watchmen so that each page would be identifiable as part of that particular series and \"not some other comic book\". He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different from that commonly seen in comics. The artist tried to draw the series with \"a particular weight of line, using a hard, stiff pen that didn't have much modulation in terms of thick and thin\" which he hoped \"would differentiate it from the usual lush, fluid kind of comic book line\". In a 2009 interview, Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons' training as a former surveyor for \"including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel, so we could choreograph every little thing\". Gibbons described the series as \"a comic about comics\". Gibbons felt that \"Alan is more concerned with the social implications of [the presence of super-heroes] and I've gotten involved in the technical implications.\" The story's alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of the American landscape, such as adding electric cars, slightly different buildings, and spark hydrants instead of fire hydrants, which Moore said, \"perhaps gives the American readership a chance in some ways to see their own culture as an outsider would\". Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because he did not have to rely primarily on reference books.Colorist John Higgins used a template that was \"moodier\" and favored secondary colors. Moore stated that he had also \"always loved John's coloring, but always associated him with being an airbrush colorist\", which Moore was not fond of; Higgins subsequently decided to color Watchmen in European-style flat color. Moore noted that the artist paid particular attention to lighting and subtle color changes; in issue six, Higgins began with \"warm and cheerful\" colors and throughout the issue gradually made it darker to give the story a dark and bleak feeling.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Darwin's previous book, On the Origin of Species, had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin\u2014a relief from the drudgery of writing\u2014developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.\nThe book was his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection, and explained how complex ecological relationships resulted in the coevolution of orchids and insects. The view has been expressed that the book led directly or indirectly to all modern work on coevolution and the evolution of extreme specialisation. It influenced botanists, and revived interest in the neglected idea that insects played a part in pollinating flowers. It opened up the new study areas of pollination research and reproductive ecology, directly related to Darwin's ideas on evolution, and supported his view that natural selection led to a variety of forms through the important benefits achieved by cross-fertilisation. Although the general public showed less interest and sales of the book were low, it established Darwin as a leading botanist. Orchids was the first in a series of books on his innovative investigations into plants.\nThe book describes how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which natural theology attributed to a grand designer. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a Creator. Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of Catasetum, which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced testable predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long nectary of Angraecum sesquipedale meant that there must be a moth with an equally long proboscis.

The year he graduated, Darwin was given a supernumerary position as a gentleman naturalist and geologist on the second voyage of HMS Beagle, a trip that lasted five years. By the time he returned in October 1836, he had doubts about the doctrine that species were fixed and unchanging. Within months, experts informed him that specimens he had collected were separate species, not just varieties, and the patterns he saw inspired the inception of his theory of natural selection in 1838. Darwin began editing and publishing the expert reports, collected in the Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, at the same time as writing a series of books on geology, the first of which was The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs.

By the spring of 1860 he had tired of the grind of writing, and needed something fresh and interesting to study. During a family visit to relatives at Hartfield, he was searching for orchids when he noticed a sundew. He collected it and tried to feed it insects, thus beginning a long-term study of insectivorous plants. He investigated other botanical questions raised by his ideas of natural selection, including the advantages of sexual dimorphism in primulas, and the adaptive mechanisms that ensure cross-pollination in orchids. As an enthusiastic practical scientist, such investigations gave him a strong sense of personal enjoyment. He relished pitting his wits against nature, and following lucky hunches. His theory was a way of looking at the world, enabling him to find creative solutions to problems that traditional approaches could not solve. He later wrote, \"I am like a gambler, & love a wild experiment.\"Around the end of April 1860, Darwin discussed insect pollination with his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, and mentioned the bee orchid. Darwin corresponded with Hooker's assistant Daniel Oliver, the senior curator at Kew Gardens, who became a follower of Darwin's ideas. At the start of June, Darwin wrote to The Gardeners' Chronicle asking for readers' observations on how bee or fly orchids were fertilised. His letter described the mechanisms for insect fertilisation he had discovered in common British orchids, and reported his experimental observations that pollen masses were removed from Orchis morio and Orchis mascula plants in the open, but left in their pouches in adjacent plants under a glass bell jar. He wrote to American botanist Asa Gray that he had been \"so struck with admiration at the contrivances, that I have sent notice to Gardeners Chronicle\", and made similar enquiries of other experts.Darwin became engrossed in meticulous microscopic examination, tracing the complicated mechanisms of flowers that attracted insects by their nectar so that the insects transported pollen to cross-pollinate other plants, and on 19 July he told Hooker, \"I am intensely interested on subject, just as at a game of chess.\" In September, he \"dissected with the greatest interest\" and wrote, \"The contrivances for insect fertilisation in Orchids are multiform & truly wonderful & beautiful.\" By October, he had \"a large mass of notes with many new facts\", but set them aside \"convinced that I ought to work on Variation & not amuse myself with interludes\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27724", "text": "Darwin set out a detailed study of common descent with modifications by expanding on the theme of coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species.

The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described.

The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.In the introduction, Darwin explained his aim of meeting complaints that detailed support for his theory was lacking in On the Origin of Species. He chose orchids for his subject as \"amongst the most singular and most modified forms in the vegetable kingdom\" in the hope of inspiring work on other species, and felt that \"the study of organic beings may be as interesting to an observer who is fully convinced that the structure of each is due to secondary laws, as to one who views every trifling detail of structure as the result of the direct interposition of the Creator.\" He gave due credit to previous authors who had described the agency of insects in fertilising orchids, and all who had helped him.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27725", "text": "Botanists responded favourably to the book immediately on its publication.

Daniel Oliver thought it \"very extraordinary\", and even Darwin's old beetle-hunting rival Charles Babington, by then professor of botany at the University of Cambridge and inclined to oppose natural selection, called it \"exceedingly interesting and valuable ... highly satisfactory in all respects. The results are most curious and the skill shown in discovering them equally so.\" George Bentham praised its value in opening \"a new field for observing the wonderful provisions of Nature ... a new and unexpected track to guide us in the explanation of phenomena which had before that appeared so irreconcilable with the ordinary prevision and method shown in the organised world.\"The book's success in botanical circles was enhanced following Bentham's public endorsement. In his presidential address to the Linnean Society on 24 May 1862, Bentham praised the book as exemplifying the biological method, and said that it had nearly overcome his opposition to the  Origin. In his address in 1863 he stated that \"Mr Darwin has shown how changes may take place\", and described it as \"an unimpeachable example of a legitimate hypothesis\" in compliance with John Stuart Mill's scientific method. This endorsement favourably influenced Miles Joseph Berkeley, Charles Victor Naudin, Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle, Jean Louis Quatrefages, and Charles Daubeny.In June 1862, Darwin welcomed favourable reviews in the press and wrote to Hooker; \"Well my orchis-book is a success (but I do not know whether it sells) after cursing my folly in writing it\". He told his publisher, \"The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies\", and to Asa Gray he said, \"I am fairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists.\"  Darwin's geologist friend Charles Lyell gave it enthusiastic praise: \"next to the Origin, as the most valuable of all Darwin's works.\" However, the book attracted little attention from the general public, and in September Darwin told his cousin Fox, \"Hardly any one not a botanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it.\" The book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen.

Because of his outstanding debts he ends up losing his lands and as such, readily agrees to travel to Assam to take on a plantation job that would pay well and allow Gangu to own his own land. However upon his arrival Gangu finds that this was all a trick and that the job is essentially slave labor. Their pay is not even enough to buy food and many of the merchants offer loans with interest rates so high that repayment is impossible. Gangu and his family are forced to live their lives in squalor and to endure all sorts of abuse and degradation. On top of this Sajani and Leila are subjected to rape and other sexual degradation.\nThe general poor treatment and living conditions provoke concern in the plantation's doctor, John De La Harve, especially as the threat of cholera looms over the plantation. He tries to persuade the plantation's boss, Croft-Cooke, into improving conditions of the workers (called coolies) but to no avail, as Croft-Cook believes that coolies are sub-human and are not deserving of even the smallest human consideration. As a result the plantation is struck by cholera and Sajani ends up contracting and then dying of the disease. Since he is too poor to perform the necessary last rites, Gangu tries to borrow money from Croft-Cooke but is turned away because he is believed to be carrying cholera.\nThings take a turn for the worse when Reggie Hunt, a British officer, takes notice of Leila and chases her with the intent to rape her. Gangu tries to stop him but is instead shot and killed by Hunt. The officer is charged with Gangu's murder, but a trial comprised predominantly of Englishmen finds him not guilty.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "50_615", "question": "Who is the author of The Diary of a Nobody?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27738", "text": "The Diary of a Nobody is an English comic novel written by the brothers George and Weedon Grossmith, with illustrations by the latter. It originated as an intermittent serial in Punch magazine in 1888\u201389 and first appeared in book form, with extended text and added illustrations, in 1892. The Diary records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, Charles Pooter, his wife Carrie, his son William Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances over a period of 15 months.\nBefore their collaboration on the Diary, the brothers each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated nine of the principal comedian roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano sketch entertainer and wrote a large number of songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The Diary was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the Diary were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate.\nAlthough its initial public reception was muted, the Diary came to be recognised by critics as a classic work of humour, and it has never been out of print. It helped to establish a genre of humorous popular fiction based on lower or lower-middle class aspirations, and was the forerunner of numerous fictitious diary novels in the later 20th century. The Diary has been the subject of several stage and screen adaptations, including Ken Russell's \"silent film\" treatment of 1964, a four-part TV film scripted by Andrew Davies in 2007, and a widely praised stage version in 2011, in which an all-male cast of three played all the parts.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27739", "text": "The Diary of a Nobody was the work of George Grossmith and his brother Weedon Grossmith, the sons of a court reporter and part-time stage entertainer, also named George. The younger George followed his father, first as a reporter and later on the stage; the 7-years-younger Weedon studied at the West London School of Art and had some success as a portrait painter before becoming a comic actor. The brothers were fascinated with the stage at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they hosted a complex programme of musical and dramatic entertainment in their parents' garden at Haverstock Hill. This included a 20-minute burlesque version of Hamlet, in which George played the title role; Weedon was Ophelia.By 1877 the younger George Grossmith had established himself as a comic piano sketch entertainer in provincial institutes and literary societies. In that year he was seen by Arthur Sullivan and, separately, by W. S. Gilbert, in performances of their one-act comic opera Trial by Jury. Impressed, they engaged him to play the comic lead in their new, full-length work, The Sorcerer. Thereafter, Grossmith created the leading comic role in each of Gilbert and Sullivan's long-running comic operas until The Yeomen of the Guard, which closed in 1889. While appearing in the operas, Grossmith continued his piano entertainment career at private parties and matinees, writing and composing his own material. He became the most successful comic entertainer of his day, writing numerous operettas, around 100 piano sketches, some 600 songs and short piano pieces, and three books. For Punch magazine in 1884 he provided a series of short sketches based on his experiences as a court reporter at Bow Street Magistrates' Court. In 1889, Grossmith ended his connection with Gilbert and Sullivan to pursue his piano sketch career full-time and continued to perform until 1908. He died in 1912.As an artist Weedon Grossmith exhibited at the Royal Academy and at the Grosvenor Gallery. He also contributed illustrations to Punch and the prestigious Art Journal. He was nevertheless dissatisfied with his financial prospects as an artist, and by 1885 was pursuing an alternative career as an actor. He continued his career on the stage with considerable success until 1918, making his name playing roles he described as \"cowards, cads and snobs\", and as browbeaten small men under the thumb of authority. He wrote several plays, of which The Night of the Party (1901) was his most successful, and from 1894 was engaged in the management of two West End theatres. He died in 1919. The literary scholar Peter Morton, who published an annotated edition of the Diary in 2009, suggests that many of the events depicted in it were drawn from the brothers' own home experiences, and that Weedon, \"something of a scapegrace compared with his perfectionist brother\", was the model for Lupin.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27740", "text": "The diary begins on 3 April of an unstated year, and runs for approximately 15 months. In a short prologue, readers are informed that Charles Pooter and his wife Caroline (Carrie) have just moved to a new home at \"The Laurels\", Brickfield Terrace, Holloway. Mr Pooter is a City of London clerk with Perkupp's, possibly an accountancy or private banking firm (though their business is not explicitly stated). The couple's 20-year-old son William works as a bank clerk in Oldham. The first entries describe the Pooters' daily lives and introduce their particular friends, such as their neighbour Gowing, the enthusiastic bicyclist Cummings, and the Jameses from Sutton. From the beginning a pattern is set whereby the small vexations of the Pooters' daily lives are recounted, many of them arising from Pooter's unconscious self-importance and pomposity. Trouble with servants, tradesmen, and office juniors occur regularly, along with minor social embarrassments and humiliations.\nThe rare formal social events in the Pooters' lives are particular magnets for misfortune. They receive an invitation from the Lord Mayor of London to attend a ball at the Mansion House for \"Representatives of Trade and Commerce\". After days of keen anticipation they are dismayed, when they arrive, to find that the gathering is undistinguished. Pooter is snobbishly upset to be greeted familiarly by his local ironmonger, even more so when this tradesman appears to be on social terms with some of the more important guests. Pooter overindulges in champagne and humiliates Carrie by collapsing on the dance floor.\nIn the summer their son arrives from Oldham and informs his parents that he wishes henceforth to be called by his middle name, \"Lupin\". He has been dismissed from his bank post for idleness; although dismayed, Pooter sees this as a chance to get his son into Perkupp's. Lupin joins the couple for their annual holiday week in Broadstairs, but relationships are strained by Lupin's \"fast\" habits. On their return, Pooter's efforts to find Lupin a job at first prove fruitless. The boy is interested in amateur dramatics and joins an organisation called the \"Holloway Comedians\". With the help of Pooter's employer Mr. Perkupp, Lupin finally secures a clerical position with a firm of stockbrokers in November. He then shocks his parents by announcing his engagement.\n\nLupin's fianc\u00e9e, Daisy Mutlar, is the sister of one of his theatrical friends and is, he says, \"the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever met\".   Pooter is disappointed when he meets her: \"She is a big young woman... at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking\". Nevertheless, in her honour the Pooters give a large dinner-party, to which Pooter invites Mr Perkupp. The party becomes boisterous; Mr Perkupp arrives at a particularly raucous moment, and decides not to stay. Pooter believes the party has failed, and is despondent, although Carrie deems it a great success. However, within a few days, Lupin informs them that the engagement is off.\nIn the following weeks Lupin often brings the Holloway troupe back to \"The Laurels\". These occasions are graced with the unexplained presence of a complete stranger, Mr Padge, who regularly occupies the best chair as if by right. Lupin opts out of the family's Christmas celebrations, and then announces, to everyone's astonishment, that the engagement to Daisy is back on. Christmas passes happily enough, despite a supper party which degenerates into a food fight instigated by Daisy.\nIn the New Year, Pooter is promoted to senior clerk at Perkupp's, and his salary raised by \u00a3100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin's announcement that he has just profited by \u00a3200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, the source of his gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest \u00a3600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.\nApril begins with another social disaster. The Pooters receive an invitation to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they imagine will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests\u2014among them Mr Padge\u2014with food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that he can barely afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle, who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.\nLupin is sacked from Perkupp's for persuading their top client, Mr Crowbillon, to take his business to another firm. Pooter is mortified, but the new firm rewards Lupin with a \u00a325 commission and a job at \u00a3200 a year. Lupin resumes his friendship with Murray Posh and Daisy, who is now Mrs Posh.   Lupin moves to lodgings in Bayswater, where Pooter and Carrie are invited to dine and where they meet Murray's sister, known as \"Lillie Girl\", a woman of around 30. Pooter learns that Murray Posh has settled \u00a310,000 on both Daisy and \"Lillie Girl\".\nPooter is summoned to meet Hardfur Huttle, who offers Perkupp's a new client to replace Mr Crowbillon. Perkupp is so grateful to Pooter for this introduction that he buys up the freehold of \"The Laurels\" and presents the deeds to Pooter.

The first of the 26 instalments was announced in the issue of 26 May 1888 with a brief editorial note: \"As everybody who is anybody is publishing Reminiscences, Diaries, Notes, Autobiographies, and Recollections, we are sincerely grateful to 'A Nobody' for permitting us to add to the historic collection\". The diary entry dates are several weeks behind the dates on which they appear in Punch.\nThe Punch serialisation ended in May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters and their friends celebrating the minor triumph of Lupin's appointment as a clerk at Perkupp's. That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months' entries to the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith.In June 1892 J.W. Arrowsmith Ltd published the Diary in book form, although its critical and popular success was not evident until the third edition appeared in October 1910.   After the First World War the book's popularity continued to grow; regular reprintings and new editions ensured that thereafter the book was never out of print. Audiobook versions have been available since 1982. The writer Robert McCrum, in a personal list of \"The 100 greatest novels of all time\" published in The Observer newspaper, listed the Diary at number 35.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27742", "text": "Peter Bailey, in his study \"White Collars, Gray Lives\" (1999), traces the beginnings of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the \"disquieting irruption of a new breed of petty bourgeois shop and office workers\" that faced Victorian writers in the last quarter of the 19th century. The Grossmiths' Diary was a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls the Diary \"a sharp analysis of social insecurity\". Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: \"putting the boot in on the lower middle classes\", says Bailey, \"has long been the intellectual's blood sport\". However, the quarter-century following the publication of The Diary of a Nobody saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such as George Gissing, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett and E. M. Forster, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as \"Denry Machin\", \"Mr Polly\" or \"Mr Lewisham\", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things. In cases such as these, writes Bailey, \"disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man ... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis.\"During the past century, the fictitious diary has developed as an accepted means of comedic expression; the original has, says Morton, \"been fertile ground which has germinated many seeds\". An early example is Anita Loos's novel of 1925: Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady in which the protagonist, Lorelei Lee, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that \"follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech\" and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, \"burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class\". The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978\u201381 Christopher Matthew produced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of \"Simon Crisp\", a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era. The title of the first, The Diary of a Somebody, is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume in The Spectator, Benny Green points out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is \"affecting as well as comical, in a way that the Matthew pastiche is not\". In 1982 came the first appearance of Sue Townsend's teenage creation, Adrian Mole, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter.Keith Waterhouse's Mrs Pooter's Diary of 1983 is an adaptation of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for Bridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The New York Times critic wrote that it \"captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to be all things to all men.\" This diary began as a weekly column in The Independent. In the 1990s the satirical magazine Private Eye lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990\u201397, in \"The Secret Diary of John Major aged 473\u20444\", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with The Diary of a Nobody, which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.\n\nThe social historian James Hammerton defines \"Pooterism\" as \"the dependent weakness and inflated social pretension of white-collar workers, constructed in the workplace but expressed just as powerfully at home\". Jon Wilde of The Guardian observes this characteristic in a number of British TV comedy creations of the late 20th and early 21st centuries: Captain Mainwaring, Victor Meldrew, and Peep Show's Mark Corrigan are all examples of characters \"whose blinkered view of themselves is forever in sharp contrast to how they are perceived by the world\". Charles Pooter, says Hammerton, was a metaphor for lower middle-class pretension, pomposity and self-importance, set up for mockery by the \"elites\". However, by the mid-20th century changes in the perception of masculine roles in lower middle-class society had stifled the mockery, as men increasingly embraced domesticity. Hammerton remarks that the Grossmiths \"would surely appreciate the irony in seeing features of the lower middle-class existence they mocked so mercilessly becoming the more universal model for 20th century family life\". Bailey remarks on how the poet John Betjeman presented the Pooters \"not as objects of ridicule but of envy, snug and secure in their suburban retreat\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the book, Klein argues that neoliberal free market policies (as advocated by the economist Milton Friedman) have risen to prominence in countries and regions such as the United States, the United Kingdom, China, the European Union, and Eastern Europe, because of a deliberate strategy of \"shock therapy\". This centers on the exploitation of national crises (disasters or upheavals) to establish controversial and questionable policies, while citizens are too distracted (emotionally and physically) to engage and develop an adequate response and resist effectively. The book advances the idea that several man-made events, such as the Iraq War, were undertaken with the intention of pushing through unpopular free market capitalist policies in their wake.\nSome reviewers criticized the book for making what they viewed as simplifications of political phenomena, while others lauded it as a compelling and important work. The book served as the main source of a 2009 documentary feature film with the same title directed by Michael Winterbottom.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27758", "text": "The book is divided into seven parts with a total of 21 chapters.\nPart 1 begins with a chapter on psychiatric shock therapy and the covert experiments conducted by the psychiatrist Ewen Cameron in collusion with the Central Intelligence Agency. The second chapter introduces Milton Friedman and his Chicago school of economics, whom Klein describes as leading a laissez-faire capitalist movement committed to creating free markets that are even less regulated than those that existed before the Great Depression.\nPart 2 discusses the use of \"shock doctrine\" to transform South American economies in the 1970s, focusing on the 1973 coup in Chile led by General Augusto Pinochet and influenced by a prominent group of Chilean economists, known as the Chicago Boys, who had been trained at the University of Chicago in the Economics department, funded by the CIA, and advised by Milton Friedman. Klein connects torture with economic shock therapy.\nPart 3 covers attempts to apply the shock doctrine without the need for extreme violence against sections of the population. Klein says that Margaret Thatcher applied mild shock \"therapy\" facilitated by the Falklands War, while free market reform in Bolivia was possible due to a combination of pre-existing economic crises and the charisma of Jeffrey Sachs.\nPart 4 reports on how Klein thinks the shock doctrine was applied in Poland, China, South Africa, Russia, and the Four Asian Tigers. In Poland she discusses how the left-leaning trade union Solidarity won the country's 1989 legislative elections, but subsequently employed the shock doctrine due to IMF pressure. The section on China discusses the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests, and the liberalization of China's economy. In South Africa she explains that the negotiations to end apartheid resulted in economic policy that went against the core of the Freedom Charter. In Russia she describes how Boris Yeltsin took power after the collapse of the Soviet Union and crafted an economic policy that turned Russia into an oligarchy. Finally, she says that during the 1997 Asian financial crisis the Tiger Nations were forced to sell off numerous state enterprises to private, foreign companies.Part 5 introduces the \"Disaster Capitalism Complex\", a complex series of networks and influence employed by private companies that allows them to profit from disasters. She mirrors this new Disaster Capitalism Complex with the Military Industrial Complex and explains that both employ the blurring of the line between private and public, through tactics like the revolving door.\nPart 6 discusses the use of \"shock and awe\" in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent occupation of Iraq, which Klein describes as the most comprehensive and full-scale implementation of the shock doctrine ever attempted, with mass privatization of Iraqi state-owned enterprises (including thousands of men being laid off) which is argued as contributing to the insurgency, since many of the unemployed became embittered toward the US as a result and joined insurgent groups afterward.\nPart 7 is about winners and losers of economic shock therapy \u2013 how small groups will often do very well by moving into luxurious gated communities while large sections of the population are left with decaying public infrastructure, declining incomes and increased unemployment. Klein describes economic policy after Hurricane Katrina, the 2004 Sri Lanka Tsunami, and the apartheid-style policy of the Israeli government toward Palestinians.\nThe Conclusion details the backlash against the \"shock doctrine\" and economic institutions which, in Klein's view, encourage it \u2013 like the World Bank and IMF.

The progress of the Rhee Wall and the lives of the workers are threatened by a great storm, during which Beric bonds with his new comrades, and after which he concludes that he has finally found a place and a people where he belongs.\nLike in many Sutcliff novels, the theme of Outcast revolves around Beric's struggle to find belonging as he is caught in various degrees of acceptance and discrimination by the various societies through which he travels. Another theme common to other Sutcliff novels is the Celtic native hound strongly featured in Outcast; Beric's progress is paralleled by renouncing his native dog in the beginning of the novel, later adopting a mixed-breed dog near the Roman camp by the Rhee wall, and ultimately having his breakthrough moment of feeling accepted when the second dog drops her newborn pup on his feet.Richard Kennedy's cover art is in colour, while the illustrations within the novel are black-and-white charcoal drawings.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Heidegger originally published the text in 1954, in Vortr\u00e4ge und Aufs\u00e4tze.\nHeidegger initially developed the themes in the text in the lecture \"The Framework\" (\"Das Gestell\"), first presented on December 1, 1949, in Bremen. \"The Framework\" was presented as the second of four lectures, collectively called \"Insight into what is.\" The other lectures were titled \"The Thing\" (\"Das Ding\"), \"The Danger\" (\"Die Gefahr\"), and \"The Turning\" (\"Die Kehre\").", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27774", "text": "The question concerning technology is asked, as Heidegger notes, \u201cso as to prepare a free relationship to it.\u201d The relationship will be free \u201cif it opens our human existence (Dasein) to the essence of technology.\u201d This is because \u201c[o]nly the true brings us into a free relationship with that which concerns us from out of its essence.\u201d Thus, questioning uncovers the questioned in its (true) essence as it is, enabling it to be \u201cexperienced within its own bounds\u201d by seeking \u201cthe true by way of the correct.\u201d This is akin to the Aristotelian way of advancing \u201cfrom what is more obscure by nature, but clearer to us, towards what is more clear and more knowable by nature.\u201d\nHeidegger begins the question by noting that \u201cWe ask the question concerning technology when we ask what it is.\u201d This stems from following an ancient doctrine to which \u201cthe essence of a thing is considered to be what the thing is.\u201d He starts from the correct or clear definition that \u201cEveryone knows the two statements that answer our question,\u201d  that is, that \u201c[t]echnology is a means to an end [and] a human activity.\u201d The reason granted is that \u201cto posit ends and procure and utilize the means to them is a human activity.\u201d If technology is a means to a human end, this conception can therefore be \u201ccalled the instrumental and anthropological definition of technology.\u201d This raises the further question, \u201c[w]hat is the instrumental itself?\u201d This entails questioning the purview of instrumentality in which means and ends are subsumed, entailing the question, \u201c[w]ithin what do such things as means and end belong?\u201dA means can be seen as that through and by which an end is effected. It is that \u201cwhereby something is effected and thus attained.\u201d In essence, it can be seen as a cause, for \u201cWhatever has an effect as its consequence is called a cause.\u201d But an end is also a cause to the extent that it determines the kind of means to be used to actualize it. As noted, \u201cThe end in keeping with which the kind of means to be used is determined is also considered a cause.\u201d This conceptualization of instrumentality as means and ends leads the question further into causality, suggesting that \u201c[w]herever ends are pursued and means are employed, wherever instrumentality reigns, there reigns causality.\u201dTo question causality, Heidegger starts from what \u201c[f]or centuries philosophy has taught\u201d regarding the traditional \"four causes.\u201d These are traditionally enumerated as (1) the \u201ccausa materialis, the material, the matter out of which\" something is made; (2) the \u201ccausa formalis, the form, the shape into which the material enters\u201d; (3) the \u201ccausa finalis, the end, in relation to which [the thing] required is determined as to its form and matter\"; and (4) the \"causa efficiens, which brings about the effect that is the finished [thing].\u201d Heidegger concludes that \u201c[w]hat technology is, when represented as a means, discloses itself when we trace instrumentality back to fourfold causality.\" To explain this, Heidegger uses the example of a silver chalice. Each element works together to create the chalice in a different manner:\n\nThus four ways of owing hold sway in the sacrificial vessel that lies ready before us. They differ from one another, yet they belong together. ... The four ways of being responsible bring something into appearance. They let it come forth into presencing. They set it free to that place and so start it on its way, namely into its complete arrival.\nWhen these four elements work together to create something into appearance, it is called bringing-forth. This bringing-forth comes from the Greek poiesis, which \"brings out of concealment into unconcealment.\" This revealing can be represented by the Greek word aletheia, which in English is translated as \"truth.\" This truth has everything to do with the essence of technology because technology is a means of revealing the truth.Modern technology, however, differs from poiesis. Heidegger suggests that this difference stems from the fact that modern technology \"is based on modern physics as an exact science.\" The revealing of modern technology, therefore, is not bringing-forth, but rather challenging-forth. To exemplify this, Heidegger draws on the Rhine River as an example of how our modern technology can change a cultural symbol.To further his discussion of modern technology, Heidegger introduces the notion of standing-reserve. Modern technology places humans in standing-reserve. To explain this, Heidegger uses the example of a forester and his relationship to the paper and print industries, as he waits in standing reserve for their wishes.Heidegger once again returns to discuss the essence of modern technology to name it Gestell, which he defines primarily as a sort of enframing:\n\nEnframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon that sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing that holds sway in the essence of modern technology and that it is itself not technological.\nOnce he has discussed enframing, Heidegger highlights the threat of technology. As he states, this threat \"does not come in the first instance from the potentially lethal machines and apparatus of technology.\" Rather, the threat is the essence because \"the rule of enframing threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to enter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth.\" This is because challenging-forth conceals the process of bringing-forth, which means that truth itself is concealed and no longer unrevealed. Unless humanity makes an effort to re-orient itself, it will not be able to find revealing and truth.\nIt is at this point that Heidegger has encountered a paradox: humanity must be able to navigate the dangerous orientation of enframing because it is in this dangerous orientation that we find the potential to be rescued. To further elaborate on this, Heidegger returns to his discussion of essence. Ultimately, he concludes that \"the essence of technology is in a lofty sense ambiguous\" and that \"such ambiguity points to the mystery of all revealing, i.e., of truth.\"The question concerning technology, Heidegger concludes, is one \"concerning the constellation in which revealing and concealing, in which the coming to presence of the truth comes to pass.\" In other words, it is finding truth. Heidegger presents art as a way to navigate this constellation, this paradox, because the artist, or the poet as Heidegger suggests, views the world as it is and as it reveals itself.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Morgan reveals that he was drugged and framed for the murder of Senior Council member LaFortier. While obtaining medical supplies, Dresden spots a naagloshi, a shape-shifting creature from Native American lore. Over the course of investigating Morgan's apparent crime, he legally entangles his apprentice Molly, as well as Captain Luccio, after they stumble over Morgan in Dresden's home. Dresden also confronts Madeline Raith of the White Court, whom Dresden comes to suspect is behind framing Morgan, and Binder, a practitioner who uses beings of the Nevernever as a mercenary.\nDresden invites Captain Luccio to accompany him on a visit to Lara Raith and accuses her of complicity, but is interrupted by the naagloshi who ransoms Thomas Raith for Morgan. Realizing he needs far more strength to combat the naagloshi, Dresden performs a Sanctum Invocation and bonds with the spirit of Demonreach, the island in the finale of Small Favor. Despite this, Dresden\u2014aware that he can't fight both the naagloshi and Morgan's betrayer alone\u2014calls the Council, House Raith, and the naagloshii, convincing each that Morgan is on the island or that the island is where they will meet to discuss further strategy. Dresden manages to take down Madeline and Binder, but it takes the intervention of Listens-to-Wind to defeat the naagloshi. Thomas is rescued but is insane with hunger, and is collected by Lara. Morgan surrenders after the true murderer manages to slip away.\nBack in Scotland for Morgan's trial, Dresden produces incontrovertible evidence that a high ranking clerk, Peabody, is the murderer, and has also been influencing virtually everyone on the Council by use of magically poisoned ink. Peabody escapes, slaughtering a large portion of the Council, and opens a Way into the Nevernever. Dresden chases Peabody down, but is overpowered. Morgan kills Peabody, but is mortally wounded.

During a respite, Luccio approaches Dresden, and confirms that her romantic feelings for Dresden were most likely manufactured by Peabody's subtle influences (as Rashid the Gatekeeper had suggested to Dresden while he was recovering in the Council Infirmary), and formally ends the relationship.

One result: the Sicilian Project, which uses sound waves to stop incoming ballistic missiles. The immense power needs of the Sicilian Project can be met only by an extremely rare mineral called Byzanium. After satellite data pinpoints the most likely source of Byzanium, Meta Section sends Sid Koplin to Novaya Zemlya, an island off the northern coast of the Soviet Union. There he discovers that the byzanium ore has already been mined. While making his way back to his hidden boat Koplin is shot and captured by a Soviet guard but is rescued by the story's protagonist, Dirk Pitt.\nUsing clues found by Koplin, Seagram determines that the byzanium \u2014 a chunk worth more than a quarter of a billion dollars in 1912 figures \u2014 was mined in the early part of the 20th century by a group of Coloradan miners led by Joshua Hayes Brewster. The group was originally hired by the French government, but persuaded by the U.S. government to steal the mineral for the United States. Brewster and his men engage in a running battle with French assassins as they make their way across Europe trying to get their stolen goods home. Only Brewster reaches Southampton alive, and he books passage on the maiden voyage of the great White Star Line ship RMS Titanic.\nRealizing that the only supply of byzanium sufficient to power the Sicilian Project now lies at the bottom of the North Atlantic, Dr. Seagram approaches Dirk Pitt and the National Underwater and Marine Agency and gives them the near impossible task of raising the Titanic. Using data from drop tank experiments Pitt is able to narrow down the search area and begin searching with deep sea submersibles. After finding a presentation model cornet that they can link positively to a member of the Titanic's band, Pitt and his colleagues know they are searching in the right place. After discovering the Titanic intact, they set out on an audacious plan to patch all of the holes and then raise the wreck using compressed air.\nMeanwhile the Central Intelligence Agency convinces the President of the United States to leak information on both the Sicilian Project and the Titanic mission to the Soviet Union in the hopes of setting a trap to capture one of the Soviets' best intelligence officers in the KGB. When Soviet leaders realize that the development of the Sicilian Project would throw off the balance of power in the world and leave their nuclear arsenal impotent, they do just as the CIA hopes and launch an operation to sabotage the mission and steal the byzanium for themselves.\nOnce the Titanic is secured for the trip to the United States, a massive hurricane strikes the salvage area, allowing the Soviets to covertly board the ship and take the crew hostage. Pitt is believed dead after being last seen on board a crashed helicopter -- but he reemerges to expose the Soviet spies within the salvage crew. With the help of Navy SEALs who board from a hidden U.S. Navy submarine, the crew regain control of the Titanic. The ship is eventually towed to New York Harbor and laid up in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. \nWhen the Titanic's vault is opened, all are shocked to discover the byzanium was never actually aboard the ship. This revelation, coupled with deep troubles with his marriage and the president's agreeing to leak word of the Sicilian Project to the Soviets, causes Dr. Seagram to have a nervous breakdown. Pitt, consulting the journal that had been kept by Joshua Hayes Brewster, decodes a cryptic entry to determine that Brewster -- fearful that he would not make it onto the ship with the mineral -- buried the byzanium in the grave of Vernon Hall, the last of the group to fall to the French assassins, located in the tiny English village of Southby.

Joe Rose, aged 47, and his long term partner Clarissa Mellon are about to open a bottle of wine when a cry interrupts them. A helium balloon, with a ten-year-old boy in the basket and his grandfather being dragged behind it, has been ripped from its moorings. Joe immediately joins several other men in an effort to bring the balloon to safety. In the rescue attempt one man, John Logan, a doctor, dies.\nAnother of the would-be rescuers is Jed Parry. Joe and Jed exchange a passing glance, a glance which indelibly burns an obsession into Jed's soul and has devastating consequences, for Jed suffers from de Clerambault's syndrome, a disorder that causes the sufferer to believe that someone is in love with him or her. Delusional and dangerous, Jed gradually wreaks havoc in Joe's life, testing the limits of his beloved rationalism, threatening Clarissa's love for him, and driving him to frustration.\nJoe goes to meet Jean Logan (John Logan's wife) at her Oxford home. Jean Logan does not want to hear about how her husband was a hero, but Joe tells her that her husband was a brave man acting out a fatherly instinct to protect a vulnerable child. Mrs Logan hands Joe a bag which holds a picnic, and then hands him a scarf smelling of rose-water, and asks Joe how many doors were open on Logan's car. She accuses her dead husband of having an affair with another woman and asks Joe to phone other people who were present at the accident to ascertain if they had seen anyone with Logan. She says her husband was a cautious man and probably only died because he was showing off to the woman, trying to prove his manliness, and thereby taking unnecessary risks, rather than hanging back and staying safe.\nDuring a lunch with Clarissa and her godfather, Joe witnesses the attempted murder of a man seated at a table next to theirs, resulting in the man being shot in the shoulder. However, Joe realises the bullet was meant for himself and the similar composition of the group of people at the other table misled the two killers into thinking the other man was their target. Before the hit man can deliver the fatal shot Jed Parry intervenes to save the innocent man's life before fleeing the scene. In the subsequent police interview Joe insists that it was Jed Parry who was behind this attack, but the detective does not believe him, possibly because Joe appears to get some of the facts of the incident incorrect. Joe leaves dissatisfied, knowing that Jed is still out there and looking for him. Like the detective, however, Clarissa is sceptical that Jed is stalking Joe and that Joe is in any danger. This, plus the stress Joe suffers at Jed's hands, strains their relationship.\nFearing for his safety, Joe purchases a gun through an acquaintance, John Well. On the journey home Joe receives a phone call from Jed Parry, who is at Joe's home with Clarissa. Upon arriving at his apartment, Joe sees Jed sitting on the sofa with Clarissa. Jed then asks for Joe's forgiveness, before taking out a knife and pointing it at his own neck. To prevent Jed from killing himself, Joe shoots him in the arm.\nJoe and Clarissa go to meet Mrs Logan. They take her and her two infant children on a picnic next to a river, to which they have invited the woman her husband was suspected of having an affair with. It turns out that on the day of the balloon accident the young woman had been with a university lecturer, thirty years her senior, with whom she was having a secret relationship; Dr Logan had simply offered them both a ride after the lecturer's car had broken down.

Saturninus takes her as his wife. From this position, Tamora vows revenge against Titus for killing her son. Titus and his family retaliate, leading to a cycle of violence.\nTitus Andronicus was initially very popular, but by the later 17th century it was not well esteemed.

Their conflict seems set to boil over into violence until a tribune, Marcus Andronicus, announces that the people's choice for the new emperor is his brother, Titus, who will shortly return to Rome from a victorious ten-year campaign against the Goths. Titus arrives to much fanfare, bearing with him as prisoners Tamora, Queen of the Goths, her three sons Alarbus, Chiron, and Demetrius, and her secret lover, Aaron the Moor. Despite Tamora's desperate pleas, Titus sacrifices her eldest son, Alarbus, to avenge the deaths of twenty-one of his own sons during the war. Distraught, Tamora and her two surviving sons vow to obtain revenge on Titus and his family.\nMeanwhile, Titus refuses the offer of the throne, arguing that he is not fit to rule and instead supporting the claim of Saturninus, who then is duly elected. Saturninus tells Titus that for his first act as emperor, he will marry Titus's daughter Lavinia. Titus agrees, although Lavinia is already betrothed to Saturninus's brother, Bassianus, who refuses to give her up. Titus's sons tell Titus that Bassianus is in the right under Roman law, but Titus refuses to listen, accusing them all of treason. A scuffle breaks out, during which Titus kills his own son, Mutius. Saturninus then denounces the Andronici family for their effrontery and shocks Titus by marrying Tamora. Putting into motion her plan for revenge, Tamora advises Saturninus to pardon Bassianus and the Andronici family, which he reluctantly does.\nDuring a royal hunt the following day, Aaron persuades Demetrius and Chiron to kill Bassianus so that they may rape Lavinia. They do so, throwing Bassianus's body into a pit and dragging Lavinia deep into the forest before violently raping her. To keep her from revealing what has happened, they cut out her tongue and cut off her hands. Meanwhile, Aaron writes a forged letter, which frames Titus's sons Martius and Quintus for the murder of Bassianus. Horrified at the death of his brother, Saturninus arrests Martius and Quintus and sentences them to death.\nSome time later, Marcus discovers the mutilated Lavinia and takes her to her father, who is still shocked at the accusations levelled at his sons, and upon seeing Lavinia, he is overcome with grief. Aaron then visits Titus and falsely tells him that Saturninus will spare Martius and Quintus if either Titus, Marcus, or Titus' remaining son, Lucius, cuts off one of their hands and sends it to him. Though Marcus and Lucius are willing, Titus has his own left hand cut off by Aaron and sends it to the emperor. However, a messenger brings back Martius's and Quintus's severed heads, along with Titus's own severed hand. Desperate for revenge, Titus orders Lucius to flee Rome and raise an army among their former enemy, the Goths.\nLater, Lavinia writes the names of her attackers in the dirt, using a stick held with her mouth and between her arms. Meanwhile, Aaron is informed that Tamora has secretly given birth to a mixed-race baby, fathered by Aaron, which will draw Saturninus's wrath. Though Tamora wants the baby killed, Aaron kills the nurse to keep the child's race a secret and flees to raise his son among the Goths. Thereafter, Lucius, marching on Rome with an army, captures Aaron and threatens to hang the infant. In order to save the baby, Aaron reveals the entire revenge plot to Lucius.\n\nBack in Rome, Titus's behaviour suggests he might be deranged. Convinced of Titus's madness, Tamora, Demetrius, and Chiron (dressed as the spirits of Revenge, Murder, and Rape, respectively) approach Titus in order to persuade him to have Lucius remove his troops from Rome. Tamora (as Revenge) tells Titus that she will grant him revenge on all of his enemies if he convinces Lucius to postpone the imminent attack on Rome. Titus agrees and sends Marcus to invite Lucius to a reconciliatory feast. Revenge then offers to invite the Emperor and Tamora as well, and is about to leave when Titus insists that Rape and Murder stay with him. When Tamora is gone, Titus has Chiron and Demetrius restrained, cuts their throats, and drains their blood into a basin held by Lavinia. Titus tells Lavinia that he will \"play the cook\", grind the bones of Demetrius and Chiron into powder, and bake their heads into two pies, which he will serve to their mother.\nThe next day, during the feast at his house, Titus asks Saturninus if a father should kill his daughter when she has been raped. When Saturninus answers that he should, Titus kills Lavinia and tells Saturninus of the rape. When the Emperor calls for Chiron and Demetrius, Titus reveals that they were baked in the pies Tamora has already been eating. Titus then kills Tamora and is immediately killed by Saturninus, who is subsequently killed by Lucius to avenge his father's death. Lucius is then proclaimed Emperor. He orders that Titus and Lavinia be laid in their family tomb, that Saturninus be given a state burial, that Tamora's body be thrown to the wild beasts outside the city, and that Aaron be hanged.

Although Henslowe does not specify a theatre, it was most likely The Rose. Repeated performances were staged on 28 January and 6 February. On 5 and 12 June, Henslowe recorded two further performances of the play, at the Newington Butts Theatre by the combined Admiral's Men and Lord Chamberlain's Men. The 24 January show earned three pounds eight shillings, and the performances on 29 January and 6 February earned two pounds each, making it the most profitable play of the season. The next recorded performance was on 1 January 1596, when a troupe of London actors, possibly Chamberlain's Men, performed the play during the Christmas festivities at Burley-on-the-Hill in the manor of Sir John Harington, Baron of Exton.Some scholars, however, have suggested that the January 1594 performance may not be the first recorded performance of the play. On 11 April 1592, Henslowe recorded ten performances by Derby's Men of a play called Titus and Vespasian, which some, such as E. K. Chambers, have identified with Shakespeare's play. Most scholars, however, believe that Titus and Vespasian is more likely a different play about the two real life Roman Emperors, Vespasian, who ruled from 69 to 79, and his son Titus, who ruled from 79 to 81. The two were subjects of many narratives at the time, and a play about them would not have been unusual. Dover Wilson further argues that the theory that Titus and Vespasian is Titus Andronicus probably originated in an 1865 English translation of a 1620 German translation of Titus, in which Lucius had been renamed Vespasian.\nAlthough it is known that the play was definitely popular in its day, there is no other recorded performance for many years. In January 1668, it was listed by the Lord Chamberlain as one of twenty-one plays owned by the King's Company which had, at some stage previously, been acted at Blackfriars Theatre; \"A Catalogue of part of his Mates Servants Playes as they were formally acted at the Blackfryers & now allowed of to his Mates Servants at ye New Theatre.\" However, no other information is provided. During the late seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, adaptations of the play came to dominate the stage, and after the Burley performance in 1596 and the possible Blackfriars performance some time prior to 1667, there is no definite recorded performance of the Shakespearean text in England until the early twentieth century.\nAfter over 300 years absence from the English stage, the play returned on 8 October 1923, in a production directed by Robert Atkins at The Old Vic, as part of the Vic's presentation of the complete dramatic works over a seven-year period. The production featured Wilfred Walter as Titus, Florence Saunders as Tamora, George Hayes as Aaron and Jane Bacon as Lavinia. Reviews at the time praised Hayes' performance but criticised Walter's as monotonous. Atkins staged the play with a strong sense of Elizabethan theatrical authenticity, with a plain black backdrop, and a minimum of props. Critically, the production met with mixed reviews, some welcoming the return of the original play to the stage, some questioning why Atkins had bothered when various adaptations were much better and still extant. Nevertheless, the play was a huge box office success, one of the most successful in the Complete Works presentation.The earliest known performance of the Shakespearean text in the United States was in April 1924 when the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity of Yale University staged the play under the direction of John M. Berdan and E. M. Woolley as part of a double bill with Robert Greene's Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay. While some material was removed from 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, the rest of the play was left intact, with much attention devoted to the violence and gore. The cast list for this production has been lost.The best known and most successful production of the play in England was directed by Peter Brook for the RSC at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1955, starring Laurence Olivier as Titus, Maxine Audley as Tamora, Anthony Quayle as Aaron and Vivien Leigh as Lavinia. Brook had been offered the chance to direct Macbeth but had controversially turned it down, and instead decided to stage Titus. The media predicted that the production would be a massive failure, and possibly spell the end of Brook's career, but on the contrary, it was a huge commercial and critical success, with many of the reviews arguing that Brook's alterations improved Shakespeare's script (Marcus' lengthy speech upon discovering Lavinia was removed and some of the scenes in Act 4 were reorganised). Olivier in particular was singled out for his performance and for making Titus a truly sympathetic character. J. C. Trewin for example, wrote \"the actor had thought himself into the hell of Titus; we forgot the inadequacy of the words in the spell of the projection.\" The production is also noted for muting the violence: Chiron and Demetrius were killed off stage; the heads of Quintus and Martius were never seen; the nurse is strangled, not stabbed; Titus' hand was never seen; blood and wounds were symbolised by red ribbons. Edward Trostle Jones summed up the style of the production as employing \"stylised distancing effects\". The scene where Lavinia first appears after the rape was singled out by critics as being especially horrific, with her wounds portrayed by red streamers hanging from her wrists and mouth. Some reviewers however, found the production too beautified, making it unrealistic, with several commenting on the cleanness of Lavinia's face after her tongue has supposedly been cut out. After its hugely successful Royal Shakespeare Theatre run, the play went on tour around Europe in 1957. No video recordings of the production are known, although there are many photographs available.The success of the Brook production seems to have provided an impetus for directors to tackle the play, and ever since 1955, there has been a steady stream of performances on the English and American stages. After Brook, the next major production came in 1967, when Douglas Seale directed an extremely graphic and realistic presentation at the Centre Stage in Baltimore with costumes that recalled the various combatants in World War II. Seale's production employed a strong sense of theatrical realism to make parallels between the contemporary period and that of Titus, and thus comment on the universality of violence and revenge. Seale set the play in the 1940s and made pointed parallels with concentration camps, the massacre at Katyn, the Nuremberg Rallies and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Saturninus was based on Benito Mussolini and all his followers dressed entirely in black; Titus was modelled after a Prussian Army officer; the Andronici wore Nazi insignia and the Goths at the end of the play were dressed in Allied Forces uniforms; the murders in the last scene are all carried out by gunfire, and at the end of the play swastikas rained down onto the stage. The play received mixed reviews with many critics wondering why Seale had chosen to associate the Andronici with Nazism, arguing that it created a mixed metaphor.Later in 1967, as a direct reaction to Seale's realistic production, Gerald Freedman directed a performance for Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Festival at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, Manhattan, starring Jack Hollander as Titus, Olympia Dukakis as Tamora, Moses Gunn as Aaron and Erin Martin as Lavinia. Freedman had seen Seale's production and felt it failed because it worked by \"bringing into play our sense of reality in terms of detail and literal time structure\". He argued that when presented realistically, the play simply does not work, as it raises too many practical questions, such as why does Lavinia not bleed to death, why does Marcus not take her to the hospital immediately, why does Tamora not notice that the pie tastes unusual, exactly how do both Martius and Quintus manage to fall into a hole? Freedman argued that \"if one wants to create a fresh emotional response to the violence, blood and multiple mutilations of Titus Andronicus, one must shock the imagination and subconscious with visual images that recall the richness and depth of primitive rituals.\" As such, the costumes were purposely designed to represent no particular time or place but were instead based on those of the Byzantine Empire and feudal Japan. Additionally, the violence was stylised; instead of swords and daggers, wands were used and no contact was ever made. The colour scheme was hallucinatory, changing mid-scene. Characters wore classic masks of comedy and tragedy. The slaughter in the final scene was accomplished symbolically by having each character wrapped in a red robe as they died. A narrator (Charles Dance) was also used, who, prior to each act, would announce what was going to happen in the upcoming act, thus undercutting any sense of realism. The production received generally positive reviews, with Mildred Kuner arguing \"Symbolism rather than gory realism was what made this production so stunning.\"In 1972, Trevor Nunn directed an RSC production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, as part of a presentation of the four Roman plays, starring Colin Blakely as Titus, Margaret Tyzack as Tamora, Calvin Lockhart as Aaron and Janet Suzman as Lavinia. Colin Blakely and John Wood as a vicious and maniacal Saturninus received particularly positive reviews. This production took the realistic approach and did not shirk from the more specific aspects of the violence; for example, Lavinia has trouble walking after the rape, which, it is implied, was anal rape. Nunn believed the play asked profound questions about the sustainability of Elizabethan society, and as such, he linked the play to the contemporary period to ask the same questions of late twentieth-century England; he was \"less concerned with the condition of ancient Rome than with the morality of contemporary life\". In his program notes, Nunn wrote \"Shakespeare's Elizabethan nightmare has become ours.\" He was especially interested in the theory that decadence had led to the collapse of Rome. At the end of 4.2, for example, there was an on-stage orgy, and throughout the play, supporting actors appeared in the backgrounds dancing, eating, drinking and behaving outrageously. Also in this vein, the play opened with a group of people paying homage to a waxwork of an obese emperor reclining on a couch and clutching a bunch of grapes.The play was performed for the first time at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada in 1978, when it was directed by Brian Bedford, starring William Hutt as Titus, Jennifer Phipps as Tamora, Alan Scarfe as Aaron and Domini Blithe as Lavinia. Bedford went with neither stylisation nor realism; instead the violence simply tended to happen off-stage, but everything else was realistically presented. The play received mixed reviews with some praising its restraint and others arguing that the suppression of the violence went too far. Many cited the final scene, where despite three onstage stabbings, not one drop of blood was visible, and the reveal of Lavinia, where she was totally bloodless despite her mutilation. This production cut Lucius' final speech and instead ended with Aaron alone on the stage as Sibyl predicts the fall of Rome in lines written by Bedford himself. As such, \"for affirmation and healing under Lucius the production substituted a sceptical modern theme of evil triumphant and Rome's decadence.\"A celebrated, and unedited production, (according to Jonathan Bate, not a single line from Q1 was cut) was directed by Deborah Warner in 1987 at The Swan and remounted at Barbican's Pit in 1988 for the RSC, starring Brian Cox as Titus, Estelle Kohler as Tamora, Peter Polycarpou as Aaron and Sonia Ritter as Lavinia. Met with almost universally positive reviews, Jonathan Bate regards it as the finest production of any Shakespearean play of the entire 1980s. Using a small cast, Warner had her actors address the audience from time to time throughout the play and often had actors leave the stage and wander out into the auditorium. Opting for a realist presentation, the play had a warning posted in the pit \"This play contains scenes which some people may find disturbing\", and numerous critics noted how, after the interval at many shows, empty seats had appeared in the audience. Warner's production was considered so successful, both critically and commercially, that the RSC did not stage the play again until 2003.In 1988, Mark Rucker directed a realistic production at Shakespeare Santa Cruz, starring J. Kenneth Campbell as Titus, Molly Maycock as Tamora, Elizabeth Atkeson as Lavinia, and an especially well-received performance by Bruce A. Young as Aaron. Campbell presented Titus in a much more sympathetic light than usual; for example, he kills Mutius by accident, pushing him so that he falls against a tree, and his refusal to allow Mutius to be buried was performed as if in a dream state. Prior to the production, Rucker had Young work out and get in shape so that by the time of the performance, he weighed 240 lbs. Standing at six-foot four, his Aaron was purposely designed to be the most physically imposing character on the stage. Additionally, he was often positioned as standing on hills and tables, with the rest of the cast below him. When he appears with the Goths, he is not their prisoner, but willingly enters their camp in pursuit of his baby, the implication being that without this one weakness, he would have been invincible.In 1994, Julie Taymor directed the play at the Theater for the New City. The production featured a prologue and epilogue set in the modern era, foregrounded the character of Young Lucius, who acts as a kind of choric observer of events, and starred Robert Stattel as Titus, Melinda Mullins as Tamora, Harry Lennix as Aaron and Miriam Healy-Louie as Lavinia. Heavily inspired in her design by Joel-Peter Witkin, Taymor used stone columns to represent the people of Rome, who she saw as silent and incapable of expressing any individuality or subjectivity. Controversially, the play ended with the implication that Lucius had killed Aaron's baby, despite his vow not to.\nIn 1995, Gregory Doran directed a production at the Royal National Theatre, which also played at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg, South Africa, starring Antony Sher as Titus, Dorothy Ann Gould as Tamora, Sello Maake as Aaron and Jennifer Woodbine as Lavinia. Although Doran explicitly denied any political overtones, the play was set in a modern African context and made explicit parallels to South African politics. In his production notes, which Doran co-wrote with Sher, he stated, \"Surely, to be relevant, theatre must have an umbilical connection to the lives of the people watching it.\" One particularly controversial decision was to have the play spoken in indigenous accents rather than Received Pronunciation, which allegedly resulted in many white South Africans refusing to see the play. Writing in Plays International in August 1995, Robert Lloyd Parry argued \"the questions raised by Titus went far beyond the play itself [to] many of the tensions that exist in the new South Africa; the gulf of mistrust that still exists between blacks and whites ... Titus Andronicus has proved itself to be political theatre in the truest sense.\"For the first time since 1987, the RSC staged the play in 2003, under the direction of Bill Alexander and starring David Bradley as Titus, Maureen Beattie as Tamora, Joe Dixon as Aron and Eve Myles as Lavinia. Convinced that Act 1 was by George Peele, Alexander felt he was not undermining the integrity of Shakespeare by drastically altering it; for example, Saturninus and Tamora are present throughout, they never leave the stage; there is no division between the upper and lower levels; all mention of Mutius is absent; and over 100 lines were removed.\nIn 2006, two major productions were staged within a few weeks of one another. The first opened on 29 May at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by Lucy Bailey and starring Douglas Hodge as Titus, Geraldine Alexander as Tamora, Shaun Parkes as Aaron and Laura Rees as Lavinia. Bailey focused on a realistic presentation throughout the production; for example, after her mutilation, Lavinia is covered from head to toe in blood, with her stumps crudely bandaged, and raw flesh visible beneath. So graphic was Bailey's use of realism that at several productions, audience members fainted upon Lavinia's appearance. The production was also controversial insofar as the Globe had a roof installed for the first time in its history. The decision was taken by designer William Dudley, who took as his inspiration a feature of the Colosseum known as a velarium \u2013 a cooling system which consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the centre. Dudley made it as a PVC awning which was intended to darken the auditorium.\nThe second 2006 production opened at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre on 9 June as part of the Complete Works Festival. Directed by Yukio Ninagawa, it starred Kotaro Yoshida as Titus, Rei Asami as Tamora, Shun Oguri as Aaron and Hitomi Manaka as Lavinia. Performed in Japanese, the original English text was projected as surtitles onto the back of the stage. In stark contrast to Bailey's production, theatricality was emphasised; the play begins with the company still rehearsing and getting into costume and the stage hands still putting the sets together. The production followed the 1955 Brook production in its depiction of violence; actress Hitomi Manaka appeared after the rape scene with stylised red ribbons coming from her mouth and arms, substituting for blood. Throughout the play, at the back of the stage, a huge marble wolf can be seen from which feed Romulus and Remus, with the implication being that Rome is a society based on animalistic origins. The play ends with Young Lucius holding Aaron's baby out to the audience and crying out \"The horror! The horror!\"Several reviews of the time made much of the manner in which each production approached the appearance of Lavinia after the rape: \"At Shakespeare's Globe, the groundlings are fainting at the mutilations in Lucy Bailey's coarse but convincing production. To Stratford-upon-Avon, Yukio Ninagawa brings a Japanese staging so stylised that it keeps turning the horror into visual poetry.\" Speaking of Bailey's production, Eleanor Collins of Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, said of the scene, \"audience members turned their heads away in real distress\". Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph called Lavinia \"almost too ghastly to behold\". Michael Billington of The Guardian said her slow shuffle onto the stage \"chills the blood\". Sam Marlowe of The Times saw Bailey's use of realism as extremely important for the moral of the production as a whole: \"violated, her hands and her tongue cruelly cut away, she stumbles into view drenched in blood, flesh dangling from her hacked wrists, moaning and keening, almost animalistic. It's the production's most powerful symbolic image, redolent of the dehumanising effects of war.\" Of Ninagawa's production, some critics felt the use of stylisation damaged the impact of the scene. Benedict Nightingale of The Times, for example, asked \"is it enough to suggest bloodletting by having red ribbons flow from wrists and throats?\" Similarly, The Guardian's Michael Billington, who had praised Bailey's use of realistic effects, wrote \"At times I felt that Ninagawa, through stylised images and Handelian music, unduly aestheticised violence.\" Some critics, however, felt the stylisation was more powerful than Bailey's realism; Neil Allan and Scott Revers of Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, for example, wrote \"Blood itself was denoted by spools of red thread spilling from garments, limbs and Lavinia's mouth. Cruelty was stylised; the visceral became the aesthetic.\" Similarly, Paul Taylor, writing for The Independent, wrote \"Gore is represented by swatches of red cords that tumble and trail from wounded wrists and mouths. You might think that this method had a cushioning effect. In fact it concentrates and heightens the horror.\" Ninagawa himself said \"The violence is all there. I am just trying to express these things in a different way from any previous production.\" In her 2013 essay, \"Mythological Reconfigurations on the Contemporary Stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus\", which directly compares the depictions of the two Lavinias, Agn\u00e8s Lafont writes of Ninagawa's production that Lavinia's appearance functions as a \"visual emblem\": \"Bloodshed and beauty create a stark dissonance ... Distancing itself from the violence it stages thanks to 'dissonance', the production presents Lavinia onstage as if she were a painting ... Ninagawa's work distances itself from cruelty, as the spectacle of suffering is stylised. Ribbons that represent blood ... are symbolic means of filtering the aching spectacle of an abused daughter, and yet the spectacle retains its shocking potential and its power of empathy all the while intellectualizing it.\"In 2007, Gale Edwards directed a production for the Shakespeare Theatre Company at the Harman Center for the Arts, starring Sam Tsoutsouvas as Titus, Valerie Leonard as Tamora, Colleen Delany as Lavinia, and Peter Macon as Aaron. Set in an unspecific modern milieu, props were kept to a minimum, with lighting and general staging kept simple, as Edwards wanted the audience to concentrate on the story, not the staging. The production received generally very favourable reviews.In 2011, Michael Sexton directed a modern military dress production at The Public Theater on a minimalistic set made of plywood boards. The production had a low budget and much of it was spent on huge volumes of blood that literally drenched the actors in the final scene, as Sexton said he was determined to outdo his contemporaries in terms of the amount of on-stage blood in the play. The production starred Jay O. Sanders (who was nominated for a Lucille Lortel) as Titus, Stephanie Roth Haberle as Tamora, Ron Cephas Jones as Aaron and Jennifer Ikeda as Lavinia.In 2013, Michael Fentiman directed the play for the Royal Shakespeare Company, with Stephen Boxer as Titus, Katy Stephens as Tamora, Kevin Harvey as Aaron, and Rose Reynolds as Lavinia. Emphasising the gore and violence, the production carried a trailer with warnings of \"graphic imagery and scenes of butchery\". It played at The Swan until October 2013. Also in 2013, the Hudson Shakespeare Company staged a production directed by Jon Ciccarelli as part of a special Halloween festival for the Historic Jersey City and Harsimus Cemetery. The production contrasted a military and modern Goth culture, but quickly disintegrated into an anarchic state, stressing the black comedy of the play.Outside Britain and the United States, other significant productions include Qiping Xu's 1986 production in China, which drew political parallels to Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards; Peter Stein's 1989 production in Italy which evoked images of twentieth century Fascism; Daniel Mesguich's 1989 production in Paris, which set the entire play in a crumbling library, acting as a symbol for Roman civilisation; Nenni Delmestre's 1992 production in Zagreb which acted as a metaphor for the struggles of the Croatian people; and Silviu Purc\u0103rete's 1992 Romanian production, which explicitly avoided using the play as a metaphor for the fall of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu (this production is one of the most successful plays ever staged in Romania, and it was revived every year up to 1997).", "hasanswer": false}]}

While still an infant he had the ballad Hardiknute by heart, and would recite it at the top of his voice to the annoyance of all around him.  As a ten-year-old he began collecting the broadsheet ballads that were still being sold on the streets, and his interest was further stimulated by his discovery, at the age of 13, of Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.  \"To read and to remember was in this instance the same thing\", he later wrote, \"and henceforth I overwhelmed my schoolfellows, and all who would hearken to me, with tragical recitations from the ballads of Bishop Percy.\"  His memory was prodigious, and by his own account it \"seldom failed to preserve most tenaciously a favourite passage of poetry, a playhouse ditty, or, above all, a Border-raid ballad\".  In 1792 Scott turned to field research, making an expedition into the wilds of Liddesdale, in southern Roxburghshire, and taking down the words of traditional ballads from villagers, farmers and herds wherever he could find any who still remembered them, and in the next seven years he repeated these \"raids\", as he called them, seven times.  In late 1799, impressed by the elegant work of the Kelso printer James Ballantyne, an old schoolfellow of his, the idea occurred to him of putting together a selection of ballads to be printed by him.

There have been criticisms of Scott for exploiting his helpers and for letting only his own name appear on the title-page, but all gave their help freely and were fully acknowledged in the body of the book.In the Minstrelsy Scott produced an eclectic edition, combining lines and stanzas from different versions of each ballad to produce what he thought the best version from a purely literary point of view.  This approach would now be considered unscholarly, but Scott wanted his book to appeal to a general reading public which had little regard either for scholarship or for ballad texts in the raw state.  In his later years he changed his mind on this point, and wrote that \"I think I did wrong...and that, in many respects, if I improved the poetry, I spoiled the simplicity of the old song\".  One aspect of his editing has proved controversial over the years.  Scott denied introducing any new material of his own into the ballads to patch over corrupt lines, saying \"I have made it an invariable rule to attempt no improvements upon the genuine Ballads which I have been able to recover\"; and again, \"I utterly disclaim the idea of writing anything that I am not ready to own to the whole world\".  J. G. Lockhart took his claims at face value, but later commentators, from Francis James Child onwards, took a different view, so that it became commonplace to accuse him of writing not just lines of his own but even entire stanzas.  However, more recent analyses of the texts by Keith W. Harry, Marryat Ross Dobie and Charles G. Zug have largely vindicated Scott's claims, showing that he was probably responsible for nothing more than an occasional word or phrase.The Minstrelsy began with a substantial general introduction with several appendices of documentary material, followed by the editions of the various ballads; each of these has an explanatory headnote which puts the ballad into its historical context, then the text of the ballad itself, and finally a set of explanatory notes.  Originally Scott wanted to restrict himself to those ballads that celebrated the Border raids of the past, but he was drawn into including romantic ballads telling entirely unhistorical stories, and also modern imitations of the traditional ballads written by Scott and Leyden, and in later editions by Matthew Lewis, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Anna Seward and others.  These three categories of ballad were clearly demarcated from each other in the Minstrelsy.  For some while Scott intended to include the Middle English romance Sir Tristrem among the romantic ballads, convinced as he was that it was a Scottish production, but it proved so difficult and time-consuming to edit that he had to publish it separately in 1804, two years after the Minstrelsy had appeared.  Likewise, one of his imitations of the ancient ballads expanded to such a length as he wrote it that it outgrew its intended place in the Minstrelsy and was instead published as The Lay of the Last Minstrel, laying the foundation of Scott's tremendous fame as an original poet.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27863", "text": "The first edition, printed by James Ballantyne and published by Cadell and Davies, appeared in two volumes in January 1802.

Irving wrote the story while living in Birmingham, England.\nAlong with Irving's companion piece \"Rip Van Winkle,\" \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" is among the earliest examples of American fiction with enduring popularity, especially during Halloween because of a character known as the Headless Horseman believed to be a Hessian soldier who was decapitated by a cannonball in battle.It has been adapted for the screen several times, including a 1922 silent film and, in 1949, a Walt Disney animation as one of two segments in the package film The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27880", "text": "The text of the story purports to have been discovered \"among the papers of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker.\" The titular \"legend\" is set in 1790 in the countryside near the former Dutch settlement of Tarry Town, in a secluded glen known as Sleepy Hollow. It relates the tale of Ichabod Crane, a lean, lanky, superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut, who receives room and board from the residents of Sleepy Hollow in exchange for educating their children. Ichabod intends to woo Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter of a wealthy farmer, in order to procure her family's riches for himself. He competes for her affection with Abraham \"Brom Bones\" Van Brunt, the town rowdy. Unable to goad Ichabod into fighting for Katrina's hand, Brom instead wages a campaign of harassment against the schoolmaster, plaguing him with a series of pranks and practical jokes.\nOne autumn night, Ichabod is invited to attend a harvest party at the Van Tassel homestead. He dances, partakes in the feast, and listens to ghost stories told by other partygoers. In particular, Brom tells the story of how he once raced against the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow, the notorious ghost of a Hessian trooper decapitated by a cannonball during the Revolutionary War. The Horseman is supposedly buried in a churchyard in Sleepy Hollow and rises from his grave every night to search for his missing head, but is supernaturally barred from crossing a wooden bridge that spans a nearby stream.\nIchabod propositions Katrina, but she rejects his advances. He leaves the party heartbroken and rides home on a temperamental plow horse named Gunpowder. It is the witching hour, and with his mind preoccupied by the ghost stories he heard earlier that evening, Ichabod sees ghouls and goblins at every turn. He encounters a cloaked rider upon a black horse, and - on spotting the rider carrying his own head atop his saddle - recognizes him as the Headless Horseman. Ichabod rides for his life, desperately spurring Gunpowder down the Hollow. The Horseman gives chase and pursues Ichabod all the way to the wooden bridge, where he suddenly rears back and throws his severed head, knocking Ichabod off his horse.\nThe next morning, Gunpowder is found grazing at his master's gate. No trace of Ichabod is found except for his discarded hat and the remains of a shattered pumpkin. With his romantic rival missing and presumed dead, Brom marries Katrina. The \"Headless Horseman\" is implied to have been Brom all along, playing yet another malicious prank on Ichabod by disguising himself as the Horseman and using a jack-o-lantern as a false head; Brom is said to \"look exceedingly knowing\" whenever the story of Ichabod's disappearance is told, and always laughs heartily at the mention of the broken pumpkin.\nYears later, a local farmer returns from a visit to New York and reports that Ichabod is alive and well. Humiliated by Katrina's rejection and frightened by his encounter with the Headless Horseman, Ichabod fled Sleepy Hollow, moved to \"a distant part of the country,\" studied law, entered politics, and eventually became a judge. However, the old Dutch wives - \"who are the best judges of these matters\" - still insist that Ichabod was \"spirited away\" by the Headless Horseman. After Ichabod's disappearance, his students are sent to another school. The deserted schoolhouse where he once taught is left abandoned, and is rumored to be haunted by Ichabod's spirit; it is said that, on quiet summer evenings, his voice can often be heard \"at a distance, chanting a melancholy psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow.\"\nIn a postscript, omitted from some editions of the story, Knickerbocker describes how he first heard the tale shared by a storyteller at a public meeting in New York. When one of the men in attendance remarks that he has doubts about certain aspects of the legend, the storyteller replies, \"Faith, sir, as to that matter, I don't believe one half of it myself.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27881", "text": "The story was the longest one published as part of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. (commonly referred to as The Sketch Book), which Irving issued serially throughout 1819 and 1820, using the pseudonym \"Geoffrey Crayon\". Irving wrote The Sketch Book during a tour of Europe, and parts of the tale may also be traced to European origins. Headless horsemen were staples of Northern Europe storytelling, featuring in German, Irish (e.g., Dullahan), Scandinavian (e.g., the Wild Hunt), and British legends, and were included in Robert Burns's Scots poem \"Tam o' Shanter\" (1790) and B\u00fcrger's Der Wilde J\u00e4ger, translated as The Wild Huntsman (1796). Usually viewed as omens of ill fortune for those who chose to disregard their apparitions, these spectres found their victims in proud, scheming persons and characters with hubris and arrogance. One particularly influential rendition of this folktale was the last of the \"Legenden von R\u00fcbezahl\" ('Legends of R\u00fcbezahl') from J. K. A. Mus\u00e4us's literary retellings of German folktales Volksm\u00e4rchen der Deutschen (1783).After the Battle of White Plains in October 1776, the country south of the Bronx River was abandoned by the Continental Army and occupied by the British. The Americans were fortified north of Peekskill, leaving Westchester County a 30-mile stretch of scorched and desolated no-man's-land, vulnerable to outlaws, raiders, and vigilantes. Besides droves of Loyalist rangers and British light infantry, Hessian J\u00e4gers\u2014renowned sharpshooters and horsemen\u2014were among the raiders who often skirmished with Patriot militias. The Headless Horseman may have indeed been based loosely on the discovery of such a corpse found in Sleepy Hollow after a violent skirmish, and later buried by the Van Tassel family, in an unmarked grave in the Old Dutch Burying Ground.According to another hypothesis, the figure of the \"headless rider\" Irving could have been drawn from German literature, and more precisely from the Chronicle of Szprotawa by J.G. Kreis written in the first half of the 19th century. In the 19th century, the police counselor Kreis noted that in the previous century, the inhabitants of this city were afraid to move after dusk on Hospitalstrasse (now S\u0105dowa Street) due to the headless rider apparition seen there.\nIn support of the hypothesis, according to information taken from the work by Z.Sinko entitled Polish Reception of Washington Irving's Work: Between Enlightenment and Romanticism from 1988, Walter Scott encouraged Irving to learn German to be able to read stories, ballads, and legends in their native language.Irving, while he was an aide-de-camp to New York Governor Daniel D. Tompkins, met an army captain named Ichabod Crane in Sackets Harbor, New York during an inspection tour of fortifications in 1814. Irving may have patterned the character after Jesse Merwin, who taught at the local schoolhouse in Kinderhook, further north along the Hudson River, where Irving spent several months in 1809. Alternatively, it is claimed by many in Tarrytown that Samuel Youngs is the original from whom Irving drew his character. Author Gary Deniss asserts that while Crane is loosely based on Merwin, it may include elements from Youngs's life.\nWith \"Rip Van Winkle\", \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" is one of Irving's most anthologized, studied, and adapted sketches. Both stories are often paired together in books and other representations, and both are included in surveys of early American literature and Romanticism. Irving's depictions of regional culture and his themes of progress versus tradition, supernatural intervention in the commonplace, and the plight of the individual outsider in a homogeneous community permeate both stories and helped to develop a unique sense of American cultural and existential selfhood during the early 19th century.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27882", "text": "Sleepy Hollow, New York, as the setting for the story, contains many of the referenced locations, including ones that can still be visited today.

Kimmel, the commander of the Pacific Fleet at that time.\nFirst released in December 1999, it received a nuanced review in The New York Times and is frequently referenced by proponents of advance knowledge theories.Historians of the period, however, generally reject its thesis, pointing to several key errors and reliance on doubtful sources.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27884", "text": "Stinnett's starting point is a memorandum written by Lieutenant Commander Arthur H.

Stinnett asserts that the overall intent was to provoke an act of war that would allow Roosevelt to enter into active conflict with Germany in support of the United Kingdom.\nWalter Short and Kimmel were ordered to remain in a defensive posture with respect to the Japanese. Stinnett claims that intelligence intercepts were deliberately withheld from them to prevent them from mounting an adequate defense. He also claims that radio traffic was intercepted from the fleet as it approached Hawaii, allowing it to be tracked, but again, the information was withheld so that the defenders would be unprepared. All, says Stinnett, was directed from the White House itself with Roosevelt's knowledge and at his behest.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27885", "text": "Reviewers were generally dismissive of Stinnett's claims, as many of his claims appear to be baseless. An article in Salon quotes CIA historian Donald Steury: [Stinnett] concocted this theory pretty much from whole cloth. Those who have been able to check his alleged sources also are unanimous in their condemnation of his methodology. Basically, the author has made up his sources; when he does not make up the source, he lies about what the source says.\nCritical points in Stinnett's argument were disputed by military historians. His characterization of the McCollum memorandum was not accepted by Conrad Crane, Chief of Historical Services and Support at the United States Army Heritage and Education Center, who wrote: \"A close reading shows that its recommendations were supposed to deter and contain Japan, while better preparing the United States for a future conflict in the Pacific. There is an offhand remark that an overt Japanese act of war would make it easier to garner public support for actions against Japan, but the document's intent was not to ensure that event happened.\" This means that Stinnett attributes to McCollum a position McCollum expressly refuted. Furthermore, McCollum's own sworn testimony also refutes it.Philip Zelikow, writing in Foreign Affairs, objected to Stinnett's claim that the Japanese naval code was being read at the time (the JN-25 code was changed shortly before the attack and was not decrypted again until May 1942), an objection also raised by Crane. A review posted on the U.S. Naval Cryptologic Veterans Association website addresses the intelligence issues in greater detail and disputes claims that the fleet was detected through direction finding; the author also criticizes Stinnett's use of testimony from Robert Ogg,  originally identified as \"Seaman Z\" by John Toland in his 1986 book. Indeed, Ogg expressly denies saying what Toland quotes him as saying. In their annotations on the 1995 Pentagon study of the attack, Frederic Borch and Daniel Martinez, chief historian at the USS Arizona Memorial, also dispute these claims and call his claims \"totally false\".Stinnett's claims of \"intercepts\" are contradicted by Japanese testimony, which unequivocally state there were none, and even transmitter keys were removed from radios of ships in the task force. (The claim of a need for \"low-power radio\" made by Stinnett  ignores standard fleet practise under radio silence, use of flag or blinker.)  Moreover, his \"intercepts\" do not amount to direction finding bearings, contrary to his claims, while his document allegedly showing the plot of these nonexistent bearings contains nothing of the kind.\"If there was this vast and humongous conspiracy\", its members had to number in the hundreds. Among them would have to be Lt. Kermit Tyler who, on the morning of 7 December, was contacted about a radar contact on an inbound flight, and told the operators to forget about it. One would also have to include the Navy duty officer, who was asleep when the destroyer USS Ward first tried to report a minisub contact, thereby losing over three hours' warning. It would also include the officer who ordered USAAC fighters be parked in close proximity to avoid sabotage.  Also included would be the senior antiaircraft officers, who ordered ammunition to be locked up far from the guns.Furthermore, Stinnett makes numerous and contradictory claims of the number of messages originated by the Kido Butai, attributing to it messages from shore stations, Yamamoto's flagship (which was not accompanying the task force), deception measures, and traffic from before the task force even sailed. Moreover, he finds \"not a single one\" originating from the Kido Butai after it sortied 26 November.David Kahn commented on the book, stating that it had \"basic errors of fact\" and \"tendentious interpretations\" and was \"an extraordinarily sloppy book\". Examples include Stinett commenting on Japanese code wheels which did not exist, and misreading a date that said 15-5-41 as December 5, 1941. Stinnett also mistakenly believed that provoking Japan into an act of war against another nation would trigger the mutual assistance provision of the Axis Tripartite Pact.Historian Gordon Prange, in an earlier work, noted that a war between the U.S. and Japan was contrary to Roosevelt's desire to aid Britain in her fight against Germany, and Prime Minister Churchill's desire to avoid \"another war\". Prange, the foremost authority on the Pearl Harbor attack, characterizes the conspiracy theory as \"an absurdity.\" British historian John Keegan writes that Stinnett's charges of conspiracy \"defy logic\", and fail to show how Roosevelt could have succeeded in bringing US Army Chief George Marshall and US Navy Chief Harold Stark into the conspiracy. Another British historian, Ronald Lewin, calls Stinnett's theory \"moonshine.\" Military intelligence historian Roberta Wohlstetter wrote that Stinnett conflated FDR's desire for an incident which might serve as a catalyst for war against Germany, with FDR's supposed foreknowledge of such an incident provoking war with Japan. Presidential historian Joseph E. Persico found that FDR drafted an appeal to peace to the Emperor of Japan the night before the Pearl Harbor attack, which historian Hervie Haughler said could not be the action of someone who wished for war with Japan.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27886", "text": "Foreign Affairs, Vol. 79, No. 2 (March/April 2000).

The book is based on the author's fourteen months' service in the United States Navy, aboard the frigate USS Neversink (actually USS United States).\nAlthough early biographers of Melville assumed the account was reliably autobiographical, scholars have shown that much in the book was taken and transformed from popular sea books.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27891", "text": "Based on Melville's experiences as a common seaman aboard the frigate USS United States from 1843 to 1844, stories that other sailors told him, and earlier sea books, the novel is severely critical of virtually every aspect of American naval life and thus qualifies as Melville's most politically strident work. At the time, though, the one thing that journalists and politicians focused on in the novel was its graphic descriptions of flogging and the horrors caused by its arbitrary use; in fact, because Harper & Bros. made sure the book got into the hands of every member of Congress, White-Jacket was instrumental in abolishing flogging in the U.S. Navy forever. Melville scholars also acknowledge the huge number of parallels between White-Jacket and Billy Budd and view the former as \"a major source for naval matters\" in the latter.The novel takes its title from the outer garment that the eponymous main character fashions for himself on board ship, with materials at hand, being in need of a coat sufficient for the rounding of Cape Horn. Due to a ship-wide rationing of tar, however, White-Jacket is forever denied his wish to tar the exterior of his coat and thus waterproof it. This causes him to have two near-death experiences, once when he is reclining among the canvases in the main-top and, his jacket blending in with the surrounding material, he is nearly unfurled along with the main sail; and once when, having been pitched overboard while reeving the halyards, he has to cut himself free from the coat in order not to drown. He having done so, his shipmates mistake the discarded jacket for a great white shark and harpoon it, sending it to a watery grave.\nThe symbolism of the color white, introduced in this novel in the form of the narrator's jacket, is more fully expanded upon in Moby-Dick, where it becomes an all-encompassing \"blankness\". The mixture of journalism, history, and fiction; the presentation of a sequence of striking characters; the metaphor of a sailing ship as the world in miniature, all prefigure Moby-Dick, his next novel.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27892", "text": "Many of the actual crew and the incidents of the voyage recorded in the ship log are transformed and figure prominently in White-Jacket. As one Melville scholar has stressed, \"Melville rarely invents...\" and \"the ship's records bear him out.\" Foremost among them is Melville's hero Jack Chase, captain of the maintop, in reality Englishman John J. Chase, age 53, whom Melville introduces in White-Jacket, Chapter 4, Jack Chase,  thus, \"First and foremost was Jack Chase, our noble First Captain of the Top.\" Melville described Chase, as having fought at the Battle of Navarino and deserted USS St. Louis to fight for Peruvian independence. The ship log confirms Melville's narrative, Chase returned to the frigate on 29 May 1842 and was pardoned, at the request of the Peruvian ambassador for his services to the government of Peru.Similarly among the officers, Melville's paragon is a lieutenant he calls, \"Mad Jack\". Melville describes Mad Jack as a model of excellence in chapter 8, in contrast to an ineffectual lieutenant whom Melville refers to as \"Selvagee.\" \"Mad Jack is in his saddle on the sea. That is his home ... Mad Jack was a bit of tyrant \u2014 they say all good officers are \u2014 but the sailors loved him all round; and would much rather stand fifty watches with him, than one with a rose-water sailor.\" Mad Jack's original was Lt. Latham B. Avery, who two of Melville's shipmates identified as Mad Jack. Melville writes (chapter 27), \"In time of peril, like the needle to the loadstone, obedience, irrespective of rank, generally flies to him who is best fitted to command.\" Melville recorded one other telling detail about his hero: \"But Mad Jack, alas! has one fearful. He drinks.\" Melville adds, \"in very fine weather he was sometimes betrayed into a glass too many. But with Cape Horn before him, he took the Temperance Pledge outright, till that perilous promontory should be far astern.\" The log for 15 August and 6 September 1842 confirms that Lt. Lantham B. Avery was court-martialed and reprimanded for leaving the deck while he was drunk.Another actual crew member is \"the Purser, who was a southern gentleman....\" The purser was Edward Fitzgerald, who like many naval officers of the era was a slaveholder. On 18 October 1841 Fitzgerald, requested the consent of the Secretary of the Navy, Abel P. Upshur, to entered his \"servant\" (slave), Robert Lucas, as a landsman (in reality his personal steward) as a crew member and whose nine dollar per month wages Fitzgerald collected. In reply, Secretary Upshur, on 26 October 1841, wrote, \"the department grants your request to take your own servant aboard the frigate United States.\" In White-Jacket, Lucas becomes \"Guinea\" the purser's body servant, the only person aboard except the hospital steward and the invalids who is exempt from being present at muster for punishment. Once in Boston, Robert Lucas was able with the help of sympathetic shipmates to flee the vessel and successfully petition Lemuel Shaw, Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court, Melville's family friend and future father-in-law, for freedom. This important case Commonwealth vs. Edward Fitzgerald re Robert Lucas, became a precedent in the naval service, effectively barring enslaved individuals as seamen.\"In both the ship log and White-Jacket, mortality is prominent; with Melville relating and the log confirming the various modes of death.\" For sailors death and burial at sea or on a foreign shore was a commonplace.\" During the long voyage, six crew members died, including David Black, the ship's cooper, \"Bungs\", who fell overboard and perished on 4 October 1843. The actual log entry for 4 October 1843, is terse: \"From 4 to 8 moderate breezes and clear weather at 5.22 David Black (Cooper) fell overboard, hove to with maintop sail to the mast and sent the Barge & 2nd Cutter in search of him \u2026 at 10.15 wore to the N hove to and hoisted up the 2nd Cutter, all search proving ineffectual.\" In White-Jacket, chapter 17, headed, \"Away! Second, Third, and Fourth Cutters, Away!\" Melville, transforms this brief passage into art,\n\n\"Do you see him?\" shouted the officer of the watch through his trumpet, hailing the mainmast-head. \"Man or buoy, do you see either?\" \"See nothing, sir,\" was the reply. \"Clear away the cutters!\" was the next order. \"Bugler! call away the second, third, and fourth cutters' crews. Hands by the tackles!\" In less than three minutes the three boats were down. More hands were wanted in one of them, and, among others, I jumped in to make up the deficiency.... For a time, in perfect silence, we slid up and down the great seething swells of the sea, but saw nothing. \"There, it's no use,\" cried the officer; \"he's gone, whoever he is. Pull away, men \u2014 pull away! they'll be recalling us soon.\" \"Let him drown!\" cried the strokesman; \"he's spoiled my watch below for me.\" \"Who the devil is he?\" cried another. \"He's one who'll never have a coffin!\" replied a third. \"No, no! they'll never sing out, 'All hands bury the dead!'  for him, my hearties!\" cried a fourth.The same incident is described by the anonymous author of Journal of A Cruise to the Pacific Ocean, 1842-1844, in the Frigate United States, who recounts a similar set of facts and circumstances.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27893", "text": "This list is not exhaustive.\n\nWhite-Jacket, the main character and narrator, so nicknamed because his coat is the only white one on board; a novice sailor (at least on a naval ship), his jacket often gets him into trouble, mostly because of its whiteness\nJack Chase, a sailor of British origin who is universally regarded by his fellow seamen and even by the officers as the epitome of a true and good sailor; he shows contempt for any man who has shipped out on a whaler\nCaptain Claret, a captain of usually severe tendencies, his name reflects the fact that he is also an alcoholic\nCommodore\nSelvagee, a foppish lieutenant whose leadership style is tyrannical\nMad Jack, a lieutenant whose leadership style is collegial\nOld Coffee, the ship's cook\nMayday, a ship's cook deputy\nRosewater, a ship's cook deputy\nLemsford, a sailor who aspires to be a poet\nQuoin, a sailor \"indefatigable in attending to his duties, which consisted in taking care of one division of the guns\"\nNord, a sailor of surly look and melancholy disposition; when White-Jacket first encounters him, the only friend Nord has on board is Lemsford\nWilliams\nWooloo, the commodore's Polynesian servant\nOld Revolver\nOld Combustibles\nChaplain\nCuticle, the ship's Surgeon\nShakings\nBland, the ship's master-at-arms\nTawney, a sheet-anchor man, a \"staid and sober seamen, very intelligent,\" whom White-Jacket sometimes invites to join the crew in the main top and tell stories.

Banks and released from 1987 through to 2012. The stories centre on The Culture, a utopian, post-scarcity space society of humanoid aliens, and advanced superintelligent artificial intelligences living in artificial habitats spread across the Milky Way galaxy. The main themes of the series are the dilemmas that an idealistic, more-advanced civilization faces in dealing with smaller, less-advanced civilizations that do not share its ideals, and whose behaviour it sometimes finds barbaric. In some of the stories, action takes place mainly in non-Culture environments, and the leading characters are often on the fringes of (or non-members of) the Culture, sometimes acting as agents of Culture (knowing and unknowing) in its plans to civilize the galaxy. Each novel is a self-contained story with new characters, although reference is occasionally made to the events of previous novels.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27898", "text": "The Culture is a society formed by various humanoid species and artificial intelligences about 9,000 years before the events of novels in the series. Since the majority of its biological population can have almost anything they want without the need to work, there is little need for laws or enforcement, and the culture is described by Banks as space socialism. It features a post-scarcity economy where technology is advanced to such a degree that all production is automated. Its members live mainly in spaceships and other off-planet constructs, because its founders wished to avoid the centralised political and corporate power-structures that planet-based economies foster. Most of the planning and administration is done by Minds, very advanced AIs.Although the Culture has more advanced technology and a more powerful economy than the vast majority of known civilizations, it is only one of the \"Involved\" civilizations that take an active part in galactic affairs. The much older Homomda are slightly more advanced at the time of Consider Phlebas (this is, however, set several centuries before the other books, and Culture technology and martial power continue to advance in the interim); the Morthanveld have a much larger population and economy, but are hampered by a more restrictive attitude to the role of AI in their society. The capabilities of all such societies are vastly exceeded by those of the Elder civilisations (semi-retired from Galactic politics but who remain supremely potent) and even more so by those of the Sublimed, entities which have abandoned their material form for existence in the form of non-corporeal, multi-dimensional energy being. The Sublimed generally refrain from intervention in the material world.Some other civilizations hold less favourable views of the Culture. At the time of their war with the Culture, the Idirans and some of their allies regarded the control that the Minds exercised over the Culture as a form of idolatry. The Homomda regard the Culture as idealistic and hyper-active. Some members of the Culture have seceded to form related civilizations, known collectively as the Ulterior. These include the Peace Faction, the AhForgetIt Tendency and the Zetetic Elench.

Many try\u2014few successfully\u2014to join Contact, the Culture's combined diplomatic / military / government service, and fewer still are invited to the even more elite Special Circumstances (SC), Contact's secret service and special operations division. Normal Culture citizens vicariously derive meaning from their existence via the works of Contact and SC. Banks described the Culture as \"some incredibly rich lady of leisure who does good, charitable works... Contact does that on a large scale.\" The same need to find a purpose for existence contributed to the majority of the Culture embarking semi-voluntarily on its only recent full-scale war, to stop the expansion of the militaristic and expansionist Idirans\u2014otherwise the Culture's economic and technological advancement would only have been an exercise in hedonism.All of the stories feature the tension between the Culture's humane, anarcho-communist ideals and its need to intervene in the affairs of less enlightened and often less advanced civilisations.The first Culture novel, Consider Phlebas, describes an episode in the Idiran War, which the Culture's Minds foresaw would cause billions of deaths on both sides, but which their utilitarian calculations predicted would be the best course in the long term. The Idiran War serves as a recurring reference point in most of the subsequent novels, influencing the Culture's development for centuries and dividing its residents\u2014both humanoids and AI Minds\u2014along the pacifist and interventionist ideals.\nIn subsequent novels, the Culture\u2014particularly SC and, to a lesser degree, Contact\u2014continue to employ subterfuge, espionage, and even direct action (collectively called \"dirty tricks\") in order to protect itself and spread the Culture's \"good works\" and ideals. These dirty tricks include blackmailing persons, employing mercenaries, recruiting double agents, attempting to effect regime change, and even engaging in false flag operations against the Culture itself (potentially resulting in the death of billions). Though each of these individual actions would horrify the average Culture citizen, the Culture's Minds tend to justify these actions in terms of lives saved in the long-term, perhaps over the course of several hundred years. The Culture is willing to use not only preemptive, but also retaliatory actions in order to deter future hostile actions against itself. Banks commented that in order to prevent atrocities, \"even the Culture throws away its usual moral rule-book.\" Andrew M. Butler noted that, \"Having established the peaceful, utopian, game-playing tendencies of the Culture, ... in later volumes the Culture\u2019s dirty tricks are more exposed.\"The Culture stories have been described as \"eerily prescient\". Consider Phlebas explicitly presents a clash of civilizations, although this phrase was used by Samuel P. Huntington and earlier authors. This is highlighted by the novel's description of the Idirans' expansion as a \"jihad\" and by its epigraphic verse from the Koran, \"Idolatry is worse than carnage\". However, it was as much a \"holy war\" from the Culture's point of view.  Throughout the series, Contact and Special Circumstances show themselves willing to intervene, sometimes forcefully, in other civilizations to make them more Culture-like.\nMuch of Look to Windward is a commentary on the Idiran-Culture war, from a viewpoint 800 years later, mainly reflecting grief over both personal and large-scale losses and guilt over actions taken in the war. It combines these with similar reflections on the catastrophic miscarriage of the Culture's attempt to dissolve the Chelgrians' oppressive caste system.

He was to go without many things, ever so many\u2014as all people do in whom contemplation takes so much the place of action; but everywhere...he was to enjoy more than anything the so far from showy practice of wondering and dawdling and gaping: he was really, I think, much to profit by it.\"\nJames clearly suffered from a sense of his inferiority in the \"showy\", active parts of life.

When a cousin of his was told \"don't make a scene,\" he suddenly realized that scenes could be made by telling a story or inventing a play. He went often to the theater and fell forever under its spell. His family met William Thackeray and Charles Dickens on their American tours, and James even remembered Thackeray mock-scolding his sister Alice for her crinoline dress: \"Crinoline? I was suspecting it! So young and so depraved!\"\nIn fact, for all his surface diffidence, James harbored almost Napoleonic dreams of glory as an artist. Near the close of A Small Boy and Others he tells how, in much later years, he dreamed of routing a monstrous attacker and chasing him away through the halls of the Louvre, which he had seen as a child.

The book was first published in 1937, when the rise of the Nazi regime was underway in Germany.

According to Bonhoeffer, \n\ncheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline. Communion without confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate.\nCheap grace, Bonhoeffer says, is to hear the gospel preached as follows: \"Of course you have sinned, but now everything is forgiven, so you can stay as you are and enjoy the consolations of forgiveness.\" The main defect of such a proclamation is that it contains no demand for discipleship. In contrast to costly grace, \n\ncostly grace confronts us as a gracious call to follow Jesus, it comes as a word of forgiveness to the broken spirit and the contrite heart. It is costly because it compels a man to submit to the yoke of Christ and follow him; it is grace because Jesus says: \"My yoke is easy and my burden is light.\"\nBonhoeffer argues that as Christianity spread, the Church became more \"secularised\", accommodating the demands of obedience to Jesus to the requirements of society. In this way, \"the world was Christianised, and grace became its common property.\" But the hazard of this was that the gospel was cheapened, and obedience to the living Christ was gradually lost beneath formula and ritual, so that in the end, grace could literally be sold for monetary gain.\nBut all the time, within the church, there had been a living protest against this process: the monastic movement. This served as a \"place where the older vision was kept alive.\" Unfortunately, \"monasticism was represented as an individual achievement which the mass of the laity could not be expected to emulate\"; the commandments of Jesus were limited to \"a restricted group of specialists\" and a double standard arose: \"a maximum and a minimum standard of church obedience.\" This was dangerous, Bonhoeffer says, because whenever the church was accused of being too worldly, it could always point to monasticism as \"the opportunity of a higher standard within the fold - and thus justify the other possibility of a lower standard for others.\" So the monastic movement, instead of serving as a pointer for all Christians, became a justification for the status quo.\nBonhoeffer remarks how this was rectified by Luther at the Reformation, when he brought Christianity \"out of the cloister.\" However, he thinks that subsequent generations have again cheapened the preaching of the forgiveness of sins, and this has seriously weakened the church: \"The price we are having to pay today in the shape of the collapse of the organised church is only the inevitable consequence of our policy of making grace available to all at too low a cost. We gave away the word and sacraments wholesale, we baptised, confirmed, and absolved a whole nation without condition. Our humanitarian sentiment made us give that which was holy to the scornful and unbelieving... But the call to follow Jesus in the narrow way was hardly ever heard.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27914", "text": "Eberhard Bethge has argued that Bonhoeffer's writings, which culminated in the Ethics and Letters and Papers from Prison, form a seamless continuity, stretching back at least as far as The Cost of Discipleship.\nUnlike Bonhoeffer's later writings, The Cost of Discipleship has been widely read by both conservative and liberal Christians and is still read and quoted today.The term \"cheap grace\" was coined by The Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, Sr., then-pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, NY. Bonhoeffer attended the church when at Union Theological Seminary, and for a season taught Sunday School there. Bonhoeffer benefited from the protest culture of the African American church and gleaned from it social gospel elements that he would take with him back to Germany. The anti-temporal power ethic would aid him to resist the Nazi regime.The notion of cheap grace has been used by Mike Lofgren to criticize the increasing dominance of the Christian right over the Republican Party coupled with what he saw as an increasing disregard within the party for other values:\nBut there is another, uniquely religious aspect that also comes into play: the predilection of fundamentalist denominations to believe in practice, even if not entirely in theory, in the doctrine of \u201ccheap grace,\u201d a derisive term coined by the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer. By that he meant the inclination of some religious adherents to believe that once they had been \u201csaved,\u201d not only would all past sins be wiped away, but future ones, too\u2014so one could pretty much behave as before. Cheap grace is a divine get-out-of-jail-free card. Hence, the tendency of the religious base of the Republican Party to cut some slack for the peccadilloes of candidates who claim to have been washed in the blood of the Lamb and reborn to a new and more Christian life. The religious right is willing to overlook a politician\u2019s individual foibles, no matter how poor an example he or she may make, if they publicly identify with fundamentalist values.\nSimilarly, Katelyn Beaty of Christianity Today warned against the Christian use of cheap grace in excusing powerful men guilty of sexual assault.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It reinterprets the Godzilla film series from the perspective of the daikaiju\u2014not a fictional creature depicted on-screen via suitmation, but an irradiated varanid-turned B-movie star named Gojiro (an homage to Gojira, the original native proper name in Japanese for Godzilla).  Gojiro, a freak mutation with a cynical worldview, suffers the pain of solitude as well as several maladies experienced by entertainers, including drug abuse and suicidal tendencies. The story revolves around his adventures with human friend Komodo, a scientific genius scarred as a child by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as they attempt to fulfill their \"Triple Ring Promise\" to bring about world peace. The odyssey takes them from their home on Radioactive Island\u2014also home to several children, called Atoms, suffering from radiation sickness\u2014to several locations in Hollywood and the Trinity site in New Mexico.\nThe novel is often compared to John Gardner's earlier novel Grendel, a retelling of the Beowulf epic through the eyes of the monster.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_27921", "text": "The earliest event is the striking of a comet into the earth 65 million years ago, at the Encrucijada Valley site as the first nuclear test later occurs. A small lizard witnesses and survives this event, and carries on his line. This lizard is revered as the heroic Varanidid by Gojiro's lizard homeland, though they forget what exactly he did. He is also the precursor of the reptilian creator-beast revered by the dying Monongae clan that lived in the same location before the nuclear tests occurred. The remains of the dead dinosaurs form fossil fuels which pool under the valley.\nMuch later, in the 19th century, Joseph Prometheus Brooks is born to a large middle American family, his father a severe and religious man. Joseph's mother recognizes his genius and manages to have him sent away at a very young age to the university of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, where he meets his future collaborator in nuclear physics, Victor Stiller. When he returns home on holiday, he finds that his father has burned the entire rest of the family to death, along with their home, believing that existence is an affront to God. Some time later, the last few members of the Monongae clan send supplications of help to the beast who lives inside the Earth to help them, and charge the youngest member, Nelson Monongae with reawakening him. That same night, he encounters Joseph Brooks' future wife Leona, who soon has visions of past and future events, including the striking of the comet, and an incomplete vision of an adult Joseph Brooks holding an object and looking at something. She travels to Germany, where she finds Joseph playing clarinet in and underground jazz club, having become disaffected by the university. They marry and travel to the United States, along with Victor Stiller, when WWII breaks out, Joseph and Victor becoming the premier nuclear scientists of the American war effort. Leona becomes pregnant nine months before the first nuclear test, a couple of years before 1945. Joseph intends the nuclear test to cause such vast destruction that it calls the attention of the creator of the world to Earth. Leona and Joseph's daughter, Sheila Brooks, is born on the day of the test, and Leona dies, having come too close to the blastwave in an attempt to witness God's manifestation.\nA couple years later, another site for a second test is chosen, the homeland of the lizard Gojiro. He is a young lizard uninitiated into adulthood and the mysteries of lizard philosophy, which involves bodily immersion in a pool of oil (the Black Spot) that bubbles to the surface. Immediately before he feels the compulsion to go to the black spot, he witnesses Victor, Joseph and a general surveying the spot and arguing, as well as the young Sheila in the window of the plane they arrived on. Gojiro is held captive by Joseph's baleful gaze at the same moment he feels the compulsion to go the Black Spot, and goes to it when Joseph breaks the staredown. Gojiro dawdles before the Spot, and just as he makes the resolution to jump, he is hit by the full force of the nuclear explosion test, preventing his immersion into full lizard-hood, and leading into his mutation into a 500 foot tall intelligent lizard, with the ability to breathe radioactive energy beams, incredible regenerative ability, and to involuntarily receive psychic messages and transport his consciousness into other bodies, due to his super-advanced \"Quadcameral\" brain, an advancement on the human three layer brain. He somehow floats to Radioactive Island, an unmapped island covered by a permanent dome of thick cloud, to which other lost souls affected by nuclear radiation will eventually float as well, along with entire pieces of land and the cultural/technological \"flotjet\" of the modern era.\nAround the same time as the nuclear tests were occurring, a Japanese scientist in Hiroshima was attempting to invent a radio with which the thoughts of animals could be heard. One year exactly before the nuclear bombing, his son, Yukio Komodo, is born. On Komodo's first birthday, the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima occurs. Two versions of this event are related. In the first version told at the opening of the novel, Komodo has a premonition of the incoming attack, and his parents die in the blast. Wandering through the blasted cityscape, he sends a supplication to Gojiro, who appears before him. In the other, his father has the premonition, and forces Komodo and the radio deep into a hole. The heat of the blast causes the radio to burn three concentric rings into his chest above his heart, which Komodo later takes to be the emblem of his bond with Gojiro. Mostly unharmed by the blast, he is nonetheless stunned into a catatonic state in which he is aware of the outside world but does not move. He becomes a celebrity after the war, meeting many famous people, including Victor Stiller. He is diligently nursed by a black soldier, Walter Crenshaw, who also keeps safe the radio he was found with. When Komodo is 10 years old, he receives a psychic supplication from Gojiro on Radioactive Island, and offers to be his friend. This awakens him from his coma, and Walter helps Komodo to escape on a fishing boat. Walter tries and fails to give the radio to Komodo as he escapes, but he keeps it safe from American authorities, entrusting it to his wife, never revealing it or Komodo's location. Komodo's death is then faked. At around the same time, Joseph Brooks drives around America with his daughter Sheila on the lam, eventually being captured, his death also being faked, and he is taken back to the Encrucijada, where he lives unknown to Sheila, and daily assumes the pose his wife had painted of him.\nKomodo arrives on Radioactive island, where he quickly becomes friends with Gojiro. Gojiro remembers this time as the highlight of his life, and they pledge to be together forever. Gojiro begins to expound philosophic dialogues, inspired by a muse he names \"Budd Hazard\", which act as an extension and elaboration of the philosophy of the lizards, centred around the processes of change, identity and evolution. Gojiro's obsessive interest in this philosophy leads him to force Komodo to alter their promise, to re-centre it around the creation of a new \"Beam and Bunch\", Hazard's conceptual analogue of a species/nation. The failure of this new promise is one of the contributing factors to Gojiro's later regret and depression. After this new promise is made, two new people arrive on the island, the child Shig and the teenage Kishi, both Japanese, the first of the \"atoms\", people affected by nuclear radiation, to arrive on the island. Komodo falls in love with Kishi, impregnating her and driving a wedge between him and Gojiro. When Komodo and Kishi attempt to leave the island, Gojiro enters a hallucinatory state of mad rage, and inadvertently kills Kishi when his thrashing causes her to fall from the boat and drown, her daughter Ebi being born at that exact instant. This event leads Shig to hate Gojiro, and causes Gojiro to become suicidally hateful of himself, but Komodo forgives his Gojiro.\nOther atoms begin arriving, and Komodo assumes a fatherly role toward them. Unlike Gojiro and Komodo's hopes of forming a new Beam with the atoms, the atoms are stupid, unruly and destructive, with the except of Shig and Ebi. Various attempts to form a bond between them and Gojiro end in failure, including a series of monster movies starring Gojiro in which the atoms appear as extras. Shig steals these recordings and releases them as feature films, to Gojiro's dismay when he finds them playing on TV. Gojiro's extreme popularity causes his fans to form a cult-like attachment to him, further fed by Shig feeding the outside world a bastardized version of Budd's philosophy. This culminates when Shig steals the design of a crystal radio Komodo has made in his lab (having become a mad scientist in the meantime), and sells them to Gojiro's fans, imploring them to use them to send constant supplications to Gojiro, begging for \"the 90 series (the capstone of Hazard's philosophy) and the PA (Gojiro's personal appearance before his fans). Through the crystal radios, Gojiro psychically receives every one of these supplications from across the world, and his mind is transported into their bodies, often experiencing great physical and psychic pain, as many of his fans are destitute and desperate. Komodo builds a radio tower to receive the supplications instead of Gojiro, the supplications killing the ground around the tower. Gojiro wanders near the tower and accidentally touches it, receiving the supplication of Billy Snickman, a feral American child who ardently watches Gojiro's movies from outside drive-in theatres. Billy merely asks Gojiro who he is, to which he inexplicably responds \"Bridger of Gaps, Linker of Lines, Nexus of Beam and Bunch, Defender of the Evoloo\". After this, Gojiro begs Komodo to sever whatever neural link in his brain allows the supplications to enter, which Komodo reluctantly does. They discover the Quadcameral brain does not possess Gojiro's regenerative powers, and the removal of the link is permanent. The vulnerability of his brain forms the basis of Gojiro's future suicide attempts. His final attempt, which he nearly succeeds at, causes Komodo to threaten double suicide if Gojiro succeeds, stopping Gojiro. He and Komodo agree to a final amendment to the Triple Ring Promise: if they fail to fulfill the promise in one year, Gojiro must be allowed to kill himself and Komodo to respect that and continue living.\nAround the same timespan, Sheila is tormented by visions centring around her father on the Encrucijada. Due to her extreme psychotherapy, she is not directly aware of this, and instead her visions are transmuted into apocalyptic nightmares that her husband Billy Zeber has turned into award-winning movies, making Sheila rich and famous. He is unable to alleviate her psychic pain however, and at a crisis point sends a letter of supplication to Radioactive Island, begging Gojiro to come to America and make a movie, Gojira and Joseph Brooks in the Valley of Decision, addressing Gojiro by the titles he responded to Billy's question. Gojiro and Komodo secretly make their way to America, Komodo shrinking Gojiro to the size of a normal lizard using a technology variously described as a shrinking pill, ray, injection or potion. Komodo meets Sheila and immediately feels a deep connection to her, but she refuses to acknowledge the plea she sent. Komodo finds that Shig got wind of their departure and managed to transport the atoms and the hyper-fertile biome of Radioactive Island to a peculiar mansion in California. Shig acts as Komodo and Gojiro's combined chauffeur, bodyguard, lawyer and spokesman, directing their activities from behind the scenes. Komodo meets figures in Hollywood, including the aged Victor Stiller. He also tries to meet Walter Crenshaw, but finds that he is dead, and his family suspect him of being an agent of the American government. Komodo convinces Gojiro to travel to the Encrucijada valley, hoping to find the source of Sheila's visions. Along the way, Gojiro encounters Billy and shies away from him, consumed by self-loathing. Komodo and Gojiro make it to the Valley, where Shig houses them in a vast underground chamber bored out by nuclear test explosions. On TV screens they see the image of Joseph Brooks that his wife had painted, but on live-feed TV screens. Komodo attempts to communicate with him but fails, and returns to Sheila to tell her her father is still alive. Gojiro remains behind, where he inexplicably begins to have a series of visions reminiscent of the 90 series supplications, where he experiences past events from the perspective of the Varanidid, and his own birth. He investigates the shack Joseph lives in, and finds a stack of paintings depicting the visions he just received, as well as the blackboard containing the equation Joseph solved to create the atomic bomb, and receives a vision of Nelson and Leona's meeting. During his spying, Victor and the general visit Joseph, attempting to communicate him, and both are briefly subject to the vision that keeps Joseph glued to the Encrucijada. Joseph says that the nuclear bomb was a failure, as it was unable to call God's attention.\nAt the same time, Komodo experiences a whirlwind of events as he attempts to take Sheila to the Encrucijada, but is waylaid by Victors government goons. Shig saves Komodo and Sheila by luring the paparazzi to them, then Komodo returns to the mansion to bury Ebi, who died soon after telling Sheila she wished that Sheila were her mother. Komodo then has a clandestine meeting with Billy Zeber, Sheila's husband, who charges Komodo with protecting her, disappearing into the night. Komodo is again captured by Victor, but is saved again by Shig and the atoms, as well as Walter Crenshaw's son.\nGojiro, still spying on Victor, has a vision of Victor's childhood, and witnesses Victor pick up the small comic book explaining Gojiro's true origin that Komodo had attempted to give to Victor, which inspires him to make a new equation on the blackboard. Gojiro returns to the cave and scrawls it on the wall, then sees on TV that the mansion has been ransacked. Komodo arrives and attempts to complete Joseph's work, arriving at a method to compress and disperse into nothingness anything at all, which Joseph hopes will be enough to draw God' attention, and Komodo and Gojiro fear will cause an \"All-Inclusive Crisis of the Evoloo\", a moment of such great chaos and change that the universe will be unable to surmount it and continue. Shig delivers the box Walter had been keeping secret, containing the Komodo's father's radio. Komodo and Gojiro simultaneously experience Komodo's lost childhood memories, as well as his and Gojiro's moments of birth. Komodo completes Victor's work, demonstrating it by annihilating some of his beloved pet birds. Gojiro is enraged at Komodo, and cannot understand Komodo's optimism at the situation. Sheila arrives and Komodo goes out to her. Gojiro takes a golden arsenic pill, but is sucked inside of it in accordance with Komodo's completed equation, where his consciousness disperses.\nKomodo and Leona meet the now centenarian Nelson Monongae, dressed as the Varanidid, who gives them a small capsule of oil. Komodo and Sheila return to the cave, where Komodo realises Gojiro has been sucked into the pill, and using devices capable of reading Gojiro's Quadcameral brainwaves, determines that whatever Beamic force had sent Gojiro's consciousness into the past was now sustaining only the single neural connection that once received the 90 series supplications, barely keeping him alive. They see Victor Stiller on TV tapping the oil under the Encrucijada, which they discern is the lifeblood of the Beam keeping Gojiro alive. The atoms blow up the derrick, and Sheila and Komodo immerse the pill in the capsule of oil, completing Gojiro's thwarted initiation into full lizardhood. Komodo links Sheila, himself (realising he is also Quadcameral) and the pill, so that Sheila's supplication can recall him from nothingness. Gojiro's dispersed consciousness experiences Sheila's birth (and witnesses Leona's death), and Sheila and Komodo's psychic union, then hears her supplication. He finds the will to live and reassembles his body, reappearing before Victor, who has an orb which is the completion of his plan to destroy all of creation. Victor tosses the orb, which Gojiro catches in his third eye, the window to the Quadcameral. The entire earth is sucked inside of Gojiro's brain, leaving him alone in space. He exhorts the world to reform itself, which it does, nobody on earth being aware of what has happened. Gojiro, Sheila and Komodo return to Radioactive Island, where Gojiro asks Komodo permission to die despite the fulfilment of the Triple Ring Promise, thinking that he is dying as he loses his regenerative powers. As they prepare Gojiro's funeral raft, they see Gojiro's long-lost homeland arrive on Radioactive Island, and rather than dying, he instead becomes the fully initiated adult lizard he failed to become as a child. Fourteen years later, Komodo leave a letter at Gojiro's homeland, telling him of his and Sheila's happy life together, and reminiscing about the time he and Gojiro spent together.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_27922", "text": "ISBN 0-87113-396-2 (hardcover, Pub Group West, 1991)\nISBN 0-553-29743-0 (paperback, Bantam Books, 1993)\nISBN 0-8021-3539-0 (paperback, Pub Group West, 1998)\nISBN 1-930815-35-2 (e-book, 2000)", "hasanswer": false}]}

The philosopher Roger Scruton criticized Wilson's sociobiological explanations of human social behavior, arguing that because of Wilson's \"polemical purpose\" he was forced to oversimplify the facts. However, he granted that sociobiological explanations of the sort favored by Wilson might possibly be correct. The anthropologist Donald E. Brown commented that he at first failed to read Wilson's book because his views were still conditioned by the \"sociocultural perspectives\" in which he had been trained.

The sociologist Ullica Segerstr\u00e5le described On Human Nature as essentially a development of Wilson's earlier ideas.

The demon gives them an elixir of immortality and the method of ending their existence, by \"devouring\" one another, and grants the summoner Maiza Avaro the formula of the elixir. Maiza and most of the alchemists decide that no one else must become immortal; only Szilard Quates opposes. That night, the alchemists begin to disappear, devoured by Szilard. Realizing the threat posed by staying together, they scatter across the globe.\nIn New York City during November 1930, Szilard succeeds in recreating the elixir, only to have it stolen by young thug Dallas Genoard. The elixir continually moves around the city because of Dallas, with the three mafiosi Gandor brothers, the two idiotic thieves Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent, and Maiza's protege Firo Prochainezo and their Camorra family, the Martillo, all passing it around. Szilard makes Dallas an incomplete immortal (meaning he still ages) to retrieve the elixir. However, all other parties accidentally consume the elixir, mistaking it for alcohol, at a party for Firo. Firo falls in love with Szilard's immortal homunculus Ennis, who betrays Szilard by telling Firo how to devour Szilard, which he does. The Gandor then cement Dallas to a barrel at the bottom of the Hudson River to punish him for killing Gandor members.\nIn late 1931, the Gandor fight the Runorata family for control of the same area after a new drug surfaces. In an attempt to resolve the situation, Luck Gandor asks his adoptive brother Claire Stanfield, an assassin and train conductor, to travel to New York. Claire agrees to, and as a conductor, boards the transcontinental train the Flying Pussyfoot. The train is hijacked by the Russo and Lemure gangs, who are trying to kidnap a senator's family, and a battle ensues between the two gangs. Jacuzzi Splot, Nice Holystone and their gang attempt to protect the passengers and fight the hijackers, while Claire assumes the identity of the Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, and slaughters much of the Russo and the Lemure. During a confrontation between Ladd Russo and Chane Laforet and the Lemure, Claire interrupts and proposes to Chane Laforet, who is the daughter of Huey Laforet, one of the original immortals aboard the Advenna Avis. A serial stowaway and newspaper field agent named Rachel flees Claire and ends up helping in the rescue of the hostages. The last remaining members of the Lemure are eventually defeated by Jacuzzi's gang, while sadistic murderer Ladd Russo is incarcerated and loses his arm to Claire. At the same time, Ennis writes to Isaac and Miria, inviting them to Manhattan. The duo boards the same train and meets Jacuzzi, and unwittingly sway immortal Czeslaw Meyer from enacting malevolent acts via bombs to be used in the New York Drug War.\nThe train arrives in New Year 1932 with the survivors going their separate ways: Jacuzzi and Nice escape custody and go into hiding after their base of operations in Chicago was taken over by the Russo family; information gatherer Rachel returns to the Daily Days mostly unscathed; Isaac and Miria introduce Czes to the Martillo family and is subsequently adopted by Firo and Ennis, who later marry, as the latter's brother; and Claire begins his mission to exterminate the enemies of his adoptive brothers, with his intentions to find Chane and marry her after the job is done.\nLater that year in 1932, Dallas' sister Eve searches for Dallas, putting her at odds with the Gandor family. These stories involved the Daily Days News Information company and the Runorattas' drug plot with Begg, a drug addicted immortal alchemist acquaintance of Maiza's encroaching Gandor turf through his miracle drugs, testing it on innocent bystanders including a young man named Roy Maddock. Eventually Eve is caught up in the turf war involving drugs with the Runoratta family and Gandors, the ramifications of the turf war affecting two lovers: Gandor speakeasy waitress Edith and her boyfriend, revealed to be Roy. The climax of the conflict results in Luck secretly telling Eve where Dallas is to spare her from bloodshed, and with Claire's help, the turf war ends with bittersweet results for Edith and Roy now associated with the Gandors until they finish the debt they compiled in the story albeit in happier terms.\nEventually in 1933, Dallas is pulled out of the river, but shortly after, he is abducted by the Larvae, a group working for Huey Laforet. Meanwhile, Jacuzzi's operations begin to encroach on Gandor and Martillo turf. Representatives (Ronnie Schiatto, Ennis, Maria Barcelito and Tick Jefferson) from both groups converge on Eve's home, where his gang is staying along with Isaac and Miria. At the same time, the Larvae arrive to enlist Jacuzzi's help; they have kidnapped Dallas to prove that immortality is possible, and attempt to convince Jacuzzi into join them. However it devolves into an incident at the mansion, forcing both parties to temporarily retreat and attract the attention of Claire after hearing Chane was injured in the battle. Their conflict reaches a prominent building in New York called Mist Wall, the largest branch office of the military equipment researcher and developer Nebula, is bombed according to Huey's plan but mitigated by the intervention of various parties involved. The gangs avert further catastrophe by stopping the Larvae group and with Tick Jefferson making amends with Larvae leader Tim, revealed to be his lost younger brother before once again going their separate ways.\nThe next year in 1934 at Alcatraz Island, Ladd Russo befriends Firo, who was framed by fellow Immortal Victor Talbot for the Mist Wall public bombing and Isaac, who was finally caught for his thefts, leaving Miria morose from his arrest. All three men meet Huey Laforet in separate occasions, who was charged with treason and conspiracy years ago with affiliation to the Lemures among other terrorist acts. Meanwhile, Christopher Shouldered, Huey's homunculus, and Graham Specter, Ladd's loyal follower, cause an all out war in Chicago through various battles enacted by the Lamia, Nebula and the Russo family led by a now immortal Placido Russo with each battling for their lives. Afterwards, Jacuzzi and his gang return to Chicago while Ladd attempts to kill Huey and fails thanks to the efforts of Isaac, Firo and Chane's homunculus sister, Leeza Laforet; however, the scuffle resulted in Huey's eye taken with the help of Lamia operative Sham, a homunculus who can take over one's consciousness by contact through his body in the form of water. The homunculus group Lamia (associated with Larvae, the group previously encountered by the cast in 1933) cause trouble for the Russo family while this happens. Several of the Lamia join their forces and others split after the conflict, particularly Christopher joining with the Russo family to protect the androgynous heir Ricardo Russo along with Lamia member Sickle and Graham Spector. Isaac is eventually released from Alcatraz along with Firo after fulfilling their mission. Placido Russo, Ricardo's grandfather and Ladd's uncle, is eventually turned immortal and consumed by Nebula scientist Renee for his failure in stopping the rampage of Chicago, resulting in Ricardo inheriting the crime family.\nThe remainder of the plot focuses of an even older faction of Immortals led by Huey's mentor and former lover, Renee Paramedes Branvillier detailed their relationship with the 1711 immortals from the 1700s till the later 1930s and how the corporation Nebula involves themselves against the other crime families by allying themselves with Senator Manfred Beriam, who bears malevolent grudges against immortals.\nIn 1935, One particular immortal named Melvi targets Firo in by manipulating the entire cast to partake in a high stakes casino royale party in a newly established building called Ra's Lance run by various Mafia families, however many other characters have various agendas that threatens his plan. He intends to endanger Ennis in order to extract the memories of Szilard Quaites by eating Firo, unaware that his bodyguard is Claire Stanfield, resulting in his defeat. Later, Renee continues to pursue Huey by attempting to reclaim their daughter Chane for an experiment which put her at odds with Claire who intends to marry their daughter. As of this writing, the conflict remains unresolved.\nIn 2001, Maiza and a few immortals appear in a rural European town to apprehend a fellow alchemist and immortal Elmer C. Albatross, who had been masquerading as a demon and was imprisoned by the locals. They uncover an age old conspiracy detailing the origins of water homunculi from the 1930s (Sham and Leeza Laforet, sister of Chane) and also putting a stop the experiments on the people that had been ongoing in the town as they remained unaware of Szilard Quaite's demise for almost the remaining century, his descendant Bild Quaites later encounters the immortals and reveals the horrific secrets of the village. Phil and Felt Nebil, homunculi resulting from Szilard's experiments are subsequently freed from the village and allowed to wander the earth, ending up in New York after the ordeal.\nIn 2002, a cult named SAMPLE launches a heist to replicate the Flying Pussyfoot incident via a twin cruise ship named Exit and Entrance only to be thwarted by Claire Stanfield and Chane Laforet's descendants, Claudia and Charon Walken with Jaccuzi Splot and Nice Holystone's descendant, Bobby Splot along with his gang with unwitting aide from another faction called Mask Makers led by Huey's descendant Luchino B. Campanella.

He believed that this choice would better attract the interest of the ASCII Media Works judges. After Narita saw The Untouchables, he spent about ten days working with inspirations and created Baccano! \"out of [his] useless calculations.\" While writing the first novel The Rolling Bootlegs, he consulted many books while writing and mixed fictional elements with historical situations to create a unique plot flow. The story he originally planned was about an ancient magician who was revived during the Prohibition and began to terrorize New York City. A group of mafiosi then violently oppose the magician. However, the story became very different from the original concept. Narita never wrote a detailed outline for the novel and is relieved by that fact because it allowed the characters to \"move on their own.\" The original stages of the series included more supernatural elements. Maiza Avaro was a hypnotist; Ennis was a succubus; Szilard was a magician. In addition, every member of the Camorra, except for Firo, did not survive. Despite the great differences between the characters' initial concepts and the result, Narita is \"glad\" that these ideas were not used in the finished novel.Narita did not begin work on a second novel during the six months after the publication of The Rolling Bootlegs because his chief editor asked him to write nothing until after he graduated from university. After his graduation, he was offered to publish his next book in August, and he submitted his manuscripts in late April, a bit behind original deadlines. He had written over 400 pages, making the price over \u00a5700, which is a high price for a novel written by a newcomer. This worried Narita because it was unlikely anyone would buy the novel. As a result, he and his chief editor decided that the novel would be released in two parts. However, Narita was still anxious about publishing such a long novel. To motivate himself to write more, he would often refer back to the dialogue he had written for Ladd Russo. As with the first novel, the plot changed because of the characters' \"movements\", most notably Claire Stanfield. Narita noted that all of the Lemure and Russo, with the exception of a character named Neider, were originally planned to die, but Claire's presence in the novel left that concept \"in ruins\". In addition, Chane Laforet, who was not well liked by the author, was also supposed to die, but as time passed, Narita became attached to her and changed her fate.While creating the anime series, art director Akira Ito and other staff members scouted Manhattan and surrounding neighborhoods to accurately portray the area. They visited the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Chinatown, Little Italy, Grand Central Terminal and various locations in Brooklyn and along the East River, many of which provide the backdrop for the events in Baccano!. The staff also visited the Steamtown National Historic Site to create accurate steam locomotives.Tyler Walker, the ADR director of the English dub of the series, held auditions for six days, during which about 140 people came for the eighteen main roles. Walker states that this is probably the longest casting process Funimation has held. He comments that because there are a lot of characters and most of them are older men, a character type he does not work with often, choosing voice actors and familiarizing them with their characters was difficult. He asked many directors and actors for recommendations and mainly aimed to cast newcomers, as he felt Baccano! provided him a chance to discover newer talent. Walker wished to find actors who could provide the dialect and accents of the various time periods and locations, especially when casting for the characters with heavy European accents.To prepare to write the script, Walker watched various movies featuring gangsters. He attempted to take what he could from The Untouchables, especially Robert De Niro's portrayal of Al Capone. Walker watched movies created and set in the 1930s, including but not limited to The Public Enemy, Little Caesar, Once Upon a Time in America, Miller's Crossing and various movies starring James Cagney, because he believed they would give him a truer feel on how people of the era sounded and talked.

Several critics from various websites have praised the series for its plot, characters, animation, musical score and its voice acting. For example, THEM Anime Reviews gave the entire series a score of 5 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Bradley Meek stating that the show was \"a joy to watch\" and despite the fact that \"the series ends on an epilogue that feels a bit flat\", it left him with \"the best possible feeling: a mixture of contentment and a hunger to see more\".

He argued that war was economically and socially irrational and that war between industrial countries was futile because conquest did not pay. J. D. B. Miller writes: \"The 'Great Illusion' was that nations gained by armed confrontation, militarism, war, or conquest.\"According to Angell, the economic interdependence between industrial countries would be \"the real guarantor of the good behavior of one state to another\", as it meant that war would be economically harmful to all the countries involved. Moreover, if a conquering power confiscated property in the territory it seized, \"the incentive [of the local population] to produce would be sapped and the conquered area be rendered worthless. Thus, the conquering power had to leave property in the hands of the local population while incurring the costs of conquest and occupation.\"Further, the nature of modern capitalism was such that nationalist sentiment did not motivate capitalists, because \"the capitalist has no country, and he knows, if he be of the modern type, that arms and conquests and jugglery with frontiers serve no ends of his, and may very well defeat them.\"Angell said that arms build-up, for example the naval race between England and Germany that was happening as he wrote the book in the 1900s, was not going to secure peace. Instead, it would lead to increased insecurity and thus ratchet up the likelihood of war.

The story centers on aging star Margo Channing, who innocently takes a fledgling actress under her wing, unaware that the ruthless Eve is plotting to steal her career and her man.\nThe musical opened on Broadway on March 30, 1970, and ran for 896 performances. It won the Tony Award for Best Musical, and Lauren Bacall won the Tony for Best Actress in a Musical.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_28083", "text": "Composer Charles Strouse and lyricist Lee Adams (who had previously collaborated on the score to Bye Bye Birdie, among others) wanted to write a musical version of the 1950 movie, All About Eve.  However, Twentieth Century Fox, which owned the rights to the movie, refused to grant them the rights to the script or the title. They were, however, able to purchase the stage rights to the short story on which All About Eve had been based, Mary Orr's \"The Wisdom of Eve\". The resulting musical could not contain any dialogue or characters that had been created for the movie but could use the original material that the movie also used. In April 1969, it was announced that Strouse, Adams, and book writer Sidney Michaels were beginning to work on the show, with Lawrence Kasha and Joseph Kipness producing. In July 1969, movie star Lauren Bacall was cast as aging theater star Margo Channing, the role played by Bette Davis in All About Eve. Bacall greatly identified with the role, explaining, \"The Margo Channing of Applause and myself were ideally suited. She was approaching middle age.  So was I. She was being forced to face the fact that her career would have to move into another phase as younger women came along to do younger parts.  So was I.  And she constantly felt that the man she was in love with was going to go off with someone else, someone younger of course, and I, too, had had those feelings\".Bacall, Strouse, Adams, and Kasha came to the conclusion that Michaels' book was insufficient, so Kasha hired Betty Comden and Adolph Green to write a new book. They updated the story so that it was set in the present day (1970) instead of the 1950 setting of All About Eve. Comden and Green also created new characters to replace the characters created specifically for the movie. Addison de Witt, the snide and articulate drama critic played in the film by George Sanders, was replaced by Howard Benedict, producer of the play in which Margo Channing is appearing. Margo's loyal assistant Birdie Coonan, the only character in the film who is suspicious of Eve from the start, was replaced by Duane Fox, Margo's gay hair stylist. Strouse commented that this change also made the show more relevant to the 1970s. (A memorable moment: Margo asks Duane, \"Are you going to be her hairdresser too?\" Duane's response: \"Only when she's laid out!\") At a later point, Twentieth Century Fox reversed its original decision and granted the musical's creators full rights to All About Eve's script; however, by that time, the show was so far along in its development that major changes could not be made to the book.

The producers initially decided to cast film legend Rita Hayworth as a replacement for the role of Margo on Broadway. Hayworth was very interested and flew to New York to audition for the role. However, unbeknownst to anyone at the time, Hayworth was suffering from the beginning stages of Alzheimer's disease and could not retain lyrics or dialogue.

{"id": "50_720", "question": "Who is the author of The Tempest?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_28085", "text": "The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare, probably written in 1610\u20131611, and thought to be one of the last plays that he wrote alone. After the first scene, which takes place on a ship at sea during a tempest, the rest of the story is set on a remote island, where Prospero, a complex and contradictory character, lives with his daughter Miranda, and his two servants: Caliban, a savage monster figure, and Ariel, an airy spirit. The play contains music and songs that evoke the spirit of enchantment on the island. It explores many themes, including magic, betrayal, revenge, and family. In Act IV, a wedding masque serves as a play-within-a-play, and contributes spectacle, allegory, and elevated language.\nAlthough The Tempest is listed in the First Folio as the first of Shakespeare's comedies, it deals with both tragic and comic themes, and modern criticism has created a category of romance for this and others of Shakespeare's late plays. The Tempest has been put to varied interpretations, from those that see it as a fable of art and creation, with Prospero representing Shakespeare, and Prospero's renunciation of magic signaling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage, to interpretations that consider it an allegory of Europeans colonizing foreign lands.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_28086", "text": "The Tempest begins with the spectacle of a storm-tossed ship at sea, and later there is a second spectacle\u2014the masque. A masque in Renaissance England was a festive courtly entertainment that offered music, dance, elaborate sets, costumes, and drama. Often a masque would begin with an \"anti-masque\", that showed a disordered scene of satyrs, for example, singing and dancing wildly. The anti-masque would then be dramatically dispersed by the spectacular arrival of the masque proper in a demonstration of chaos and vice being swept away by glorious civilisation. In Shakespeare's play, the storm in scene one functions as the anti-masque for the masque proper in act four.The masque in The Tempest is not an actual masque; rather, it is an analogous scene intended to mimic and evoke a masque, while serving the narrative of the drama that contains it. The masque is a culmination of the primary action in The Tempest: Prospero's intention to not only seek revenge on his usurpers, but to regain his rightful position as Duke of Milan. Most important to his plot to regain his power and position is to marry Miranda to Ferdinand, heir to the King of Naples. This marriage will secure Prospero's position by securing his legacy. The chastity of the bride is considered essential and greatly valued in royal lineages. This is true not only in Prospero's plot, but also notably in the court of the virgin queen, Elizabeth. Sir Walter Raleigh had in fact named one of the new world colonies \"Virginia\" after his monarch's chastity. It was also understood by James, king when The Tempest was first produced, as he arranged political marriages for his grandchildren. What could possibly go wrong with Prospero's plans for his daughter is nature: the fact that Miranda is a young woman who has just arrived at a time in her life when natural attractions among young people become powerful. One threat is the 24-year-old Caliban, who has spoken of his desire to rape Miranda, and \"people this isle with Calibans\", and who has also offered Miranda's body to a drunken Stephano. Another threat is represented by the young couple themselves, who might succumb to each other prematurely. Prospero says:\n\nProspero, keenly aware of all this, feels the need to teach Miranda\u2014an intention he first stated in act one. The need to teach Miranda is what inspires Prospero in act four to create the masque, and the \"value of chastity\" is a primary lesson being taught by the masque along with having a happy marriage.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_28087", "text": "The Tempest first appeared in print in 1623 in the collection of 36 of Shakespeare's plays entitled, Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies; Published according to the True and Original Copies, which is known as the First Folio. The plays, including The Tempest, were gathered and edited by John Heminges and Henry Condell.A handwritten manuscript of The Tempest was prepared by Ralph Crane, a scrivener employed by the King's Men. (A scrivener is one who has a talent and is practiced at using a quill pen and ink to create legible manuscripts.) Crane probably copied from Shakespeare's rough draft, and based his style on Ben Jonson's Folio of 1616. Crane is thought to have neatened texts, edited the divisions of acts and scenes, and sometimes added his own improvements. He was fond of joining words with hyphens, and using elisions with apostrophes, for example by changing \"with the king\" to read: \"w'th' King\". The elaborate stage directions in The Tempest may have been due to Crane; they provide evidence regarding how the play was staged by the King's Company.The entire First Folio project was delivered to the blind printer, William Jaggard, and printing began in 1622. The Tempest is the first play in the publication. It was proofread and printed with special care; it is the most well-printed and the cleanest text of the thirty-six plays. To do the work of setting the type in the printing press, three compositors were used for The Tempest. In the 1960s, a landmark bibliographic study of the First Folio was accomplished by Charlton Hinman. Based on distinctive quirks in the printed words on the page, the study was able to individuate the compositors, and reveal that three compositors worked on The Tempest, who are known as Compositor B, C, and F. Compositor B worked on The Tempest's first page as well as six other pages. He was an experienced journeyman in Jaggard's printshop, who occasionally could be careless. He also was fond of dashes and colons, where modern editions use commas. In his role, he may have had a responsibility for the entire First Folio. The other two, Compositors C and F, worked full-time and were experienced printers.At the time, spelling and punctuation was not standardized and will vary from page to page, because each compositor had their individual preferences and styles. There is evidence that the press run was stopped at least four times, which allowed proofreading and corrections. However, a page with an error would not be discarded, so pages late in any given press run would be the most accurate, and each of the final printed folios may vary in this regard. This is the common practice at the time. There is also an instance of a letter (a metal sort or a type) being damaged (possibly) during the course of a run and changing the meaning of a word: After the masque Ferdinand says,\n\nThe word \"wise\" at the end of line 123 was printed with the traditional long \"s\" that resembles an \"f\". But in 1978 it was suggested that during the press run, a small piece of the crossbar on the type had broken off, and the word should be \"wife\". Modern editors have not come to an agreement\u2014Oxford says \"wife\", Arden says \"wise\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Since he was also working on the novels Rhoda Fleming and Vittoria in these years progress was slow, but Harry Richmond was completed by 1870. It first appeared in Cornhill Magazine between September 1870 and November 1871, with illustrations by George du Maurier.

What swiftness and beauty and strength!  It is the flight of a young golden eagle high across seas and mountains.\" Gore Vidal claimed that Mark Twain enjoyed and \"stole\" the characters of the Duke and the Dauphin in Huckleberry Finn from Harry Richmond, and noted:\n\nThey knew that literature was (let us use the past tense) never a democracy or even a republic.

She based it on the legend of the tennin Ceres and her stolen hagoromo. This legend is also the basis for one of the most performed Japanese Noh plays, Hagoromo. It is the Japanese version of the Swan Maiden legend; versions from other cultures are mentioned throughout the series. As with most of her serials, Watase planned the basic story line of Ceres through to the end before beginning work. She notes that it is easier to work this way, but that even with planning sometimes the characters will \"move on their own\" and refuse to follow her original plans. When she reaches the end of the work, though, she can understand why they did so. Watase noted that one of the hardest parts of writing a serial manga was having to plan for a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter. She wanted each one to make the reader want to know what happened next, so they would want to keep reading.To accurately depict the many locations used within the series, Watase traveled to Miyagi, Okinawa, and Tochigi to visit the locations where legends say Tennin landed. She was able to negotiate entry into some areas normally closed to the public. The characters in Ceres are not based on real people, but Watase notes that each one reflects some part of herself, as does the story as a whole. For example, Watase incorporated her thoughts on genetic engineering and other new technologies through the character of Kagami, who shows cruel disregard for the lives of the celestial beings he creates. While she feels such technologies can be useful to society, they should not be abused. Watase purposefully left Ceres' true nature ambiguous in the end, never clearly stating whether Ceres is an alien or truly a being descended from heaven. She notes, however, that part of the reason for this was that it wasn't something she'd thought about. On reflection, she felt Ceres was a symbol. In Japan, men are considered the dominant sex, and Watase notes that as a woman there are things about the system that anger her, such as men saying she is \"just a woman.\" Ceres became a story about the relationship between men and women. She also wanted to show that while the Tennin and the humans in the story may have come from different origins, and evolved differently, they were still the same living creature in the end, with similar feelings and thoughts.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_28164", "text": "Ceres, Celestial Legend won the 43rd Shogakukan Manga Award in the sh\u014djo category in 1998.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Their people are ruled by two hundred lords whose forefathers arrived 1500 years earlier and rebuilt a world devastated by many wars. In return, they were granted a 1% tax. Later, all mass manufacturing was outlawed and the people became artisans, selling their handmade work to a single company controlled by the lords. Amiante is a master woodcarver, and his son follows in his trade.\nWhen he is eight, Ghyl attends a puppet show; part of the entertainment is the traditional drama of Emphyrio, a legendary hero. The proprietor points out a young girl in the audience and informs the boy that she is the daughter of a lord. Some time later, he and a friend sneak aboard a space yacht out of curiosity and are caught by the same girl. She has them beaten and thrown out.\nAs time passes, Ghyl comes to realize that his father is dissatisfied with the constraints of their society. Twice, Amiante is caught by the authorities illegally duplicating ancient documents; the second time, he is taken away for four days. Soon after his release, he died.\nA few years later, Ghyl goes to a ball and encounters the girl, now an appealingly attractive woman, for the third time and finally learns her name, Shanne. That night, they become lovers. But she tells him that she is leaving soon to travel to the stars.\nAn acquaintance persuades Ghyl and three other friends to hijack a space yacht and hold the passengers for ransom. The scheme is only made possible because Ghyl knows the departure date and the particular ship (the same one he sneaked aboard years before) that Shanne is leaving on. However, no ransom is forthcoming. When Ghyl wants to release their captives, there is violent opposition from his fellow kidnappers, resulting in several deaths. In the end, they reach an uneasy compromise: Ghyl is left on a planet with the lords, while the rest take the ship.\nGhyl guides his charges to civilization, but notices their odd behavior along the way. He then slips away before they have him arrested. By chance, he sees one of his father's works in a shop. He discovers that it is a reproduction and that the priceless original is in a museum. He talks the shop owner into financing a venture to buy artwork on Halma for more than the pittance the lords pay.\nHowever, for some reason, no one is willing to sell to him. Then, though disguised, he is recognized and sentenced to death for his earlier crimes. Escaping a horrible execution undetected, he steals the best works from a warehouse, takes his cargo to Earth, and sells it for a fortune.\nWhile there, he visits the Historical Institute and learns the true history of his homeworld. The alien Damarans were forced to abandon Halma by spacefaring invaders. They found refuge on its moon and eventually struck back with warriors they had bred, but by then, their enemy had departed and humans had arrived, only to be attacked. Emphyrio attempted to negotiate peace, but was killed by the Damarans. However, the warriors listened to his message and stopped fighting, forcing the Damarans to resort to other means.\nGhyl visits the Damaran moon and finds Emphyrio's place of execution. Seeing the Damarans firsthand, he deduces something of monumental importance. He goes to see the head of the lords on Halma and threatens to broadcast the truth about their relationship with the Damarans. With this leverage, he forces them to leave Halma.

The valley behind the Mountain was eventually settled, and named the Valley of Gold. The people of this Valley learned the secrets of Mountain Heart, and deliberately prevented the bukshah from traveling up there; the fungus, uneaten, caused the river to flow with greater pressure, giving the people of the Valley more gold and riches. However, this also made the ice creepers more populous, causing the first Cold Time. The people eventually allowed the Bukshah to climb the mountain again, and the balance was restored - but they never told their Traveller friends the Mountain's secret. Many years later, the people of the Valley of Gold discovered the mountain berries, but that winter, before the berries completed their life-cycle, the Zebak took a foothold in Maris and messengers were sent to the Valley asking for reinforcements. The people of the Valley left for the coast, but the keeper of the bukshah remained with the keeper of the silks, and soon one warrior returned - the people of the Valley had been captured by the Zebak before they'd even reached the coast. When the Bukshah left the Valley for Mountain Heart, the three companions followed them, hiding in the cave after the beasts had left.

The Mountain wall, undermined by the roots of the trees, collapsed, and Mountain Heart was blocked, sealing the companions inside.

Bush, and ended up playing a major role in his re-election.As early as the 1990s, Boyd had become seriously concerned about the politicization of Christianity in North America. Boyd was especially disturbed by the way in which Evangelical Christians had come to align themselves with right-wing politics and the Republican Party. Instead of endorsing Bush for president, he delivered a sermon series entitled \"The Cross and the Sword\" calling on Christians to take a more humble approach toward politics, arguing instead that Christians should be careful not to align themselves with any particular political ideology, party, or candidate and should instead focus on following Jesus and embodying the values he taught.

He instead argues that America is flawed and imperfect just like any other nation, and that the United States mirrors all other nations, or \"kingdoms of the world\" as the book calls them.

Boyd argues that Christians owe their full allegiance to the Kingdom of God and must reject the coercive, violent, and unjust methods and means used by the kingdoms of the world. Christians, he believes, have no duty to \"Take America Back for God\" or to even be involved in the political sphere, and should not use politics as a means of transforming society.

The Otori army lies in wait to ambush him, so Takeo leads them over the mountains, and across the river near Kibi, with the assistance of a bridge made by Jo-an and some outcasts.  His second-in-command is the homosexual monk Makoto, a friend of his from Terayama; Makoto criticizes many of Takeo's unorthodox methods, but nonetheless is very loyal to him.  After a minor skirmish with some bandits, they lead the army to Maruyama, the domain that Lady Maruyama left to Kaede.  Lady Maruyama's son-in-law, Iida Nariaki, a cousin to Iida Sadamu, has marched in to Maruyama just ahead of them, but Iida's army gets caught between the Maruyama and Takeo's armies, and are defeated.  Takeo takes up Maruyama as his base of operations, and he and Kaede prepare to restore the domain\nMeanwhile, Shizuka and Kondo Kiichi arrive at the hidden Muto village, and are reunited with her uncle, Kenji, and her two sons.  She fears the consequences that will come from Kaede's rash marriage.  From Kenji she learns of the Kikuta's belief in the existence of records on the tribe compiled by Shigeru before his death.  They decide to send Kondo to Arai, to gauge his reaction to Kaede's marriage, and his feeling towards his sons by Shizuka.  Kenji also tells her how his daughter Yuki was recently married to Akio but was forced to take her life after her son by Takeo was born, because the Kikuta were suspicious of her love for Takeo.  The child will remain with the Kikuta, who have their own plans concerning the boy and Takeo's futures.  Kenji's grief at his daughter's death has caused him to split from the Kikuta; regretful of his betrayal of Shigeru, he now tries to rally the other families of the Tribe to help Takeo.\nIn Maruyama, they start restoring the land and estates.  Takeo is threatened by the local Tribe members, so using Shigeru's records, he has them rounded up and the adults executed.  His mind turns to Hagi, and he concocts a plan to invade it by sea.  He travels to Oshima island to meet his childhood friend Terada Fumio, whose family have now become pirates, to seek an alliance.  Kaede wants to accompany him, but he tells her to stay.  On the way he meets Ryoma, an illegitimate son of his Uncle, Masahiro.  He makes an agreement with Fumio's father, but his return is delayed by typhoons, and he almost drowns in a storm.\nDespite Sugita's objections, Kaede rides to Shirakawa with Hiroshi, and finds that Shoji, the Shirakawa retainer, had given up her sisters to Fujiwara, and returned her hostage to his family.  Shocked, she hides the records on the Tribe at the nearby Shrine, and rides to demand her sisters return.  Fujiwara abducts her, and only Hiroshi escapes to later bring the news to Maruyama.  Fujiwara declares her marriage to Takeo to be illegal, and he forces her to marry him.  Their marriage is celibate: he is not interested in her as a woman, but as a treasure, to be locked away, well-cared for but not given any information.  However, one of Shizuka's cousins manages to bring Kaede messages for a time- until Fujiwara discovers her and has her murdered.\nTakeo returns and hears the news of Kaede's abduction.  His army marches towards Shirakawa, but discovers not only Fujiwara's garrison, but Arai's larger army.  Caught between them, Takeo is defeated but manages to extract his forces.  They retreat to the coast as Maruyama surrenders to Arai's men, hoping for Fumio to come by boat, but the weather delays him.  Takeo submits to Arai, but rather than killing him, they enter into an alliance against the Otori lords (Shigeru's uncles), but to dispel rumors about him being one of the hidden, Takeo is forced to kill the outcast Jo-an.  Kenji, turned against the Kikuta because of the murder of his daughter, comes to Takeo and brings a truce, and an alliance on behalf of the Tribe, save the Kikuta.  Before they leave, Fumio demonstrates to Takeo the use of a firearm, an invention obtained from the white barbarians.\nArai's army marches north, and Takeo sails around the coast to Hagi.  With Kenji and Taku, Arai and Shizuka's younger son, they sneak into the castle, and kill the lords and their families.  When Arai's army arrives, he betrays Takeo; he intended to use Takeo to take out the Otori Lords for him, removing the last obstacle to his total rule of the Three Countries.  Enraged, Takeo threatens to kill Arai's sons Zenko and Taku (who are standing next to him) which makes Arai pause.  Fumio shoots Arai dead with the firearm, and at that moment a huge earthquake rocks the entire three countries.  It destroys Arai's army, and in Shirakawa it destroys Fujiwara and his household in an example of Deus ex machina.  Kondo Kiichi, in a last act of loyalty to Kaede, sacrifices himself to hold Fujiwara inside his burning house.  However, Kaede's oiled hair accidentally catches fire.\nThe Kikuta master, Kotaro, sneaks into Takeo's house to assassinate him, as he did to his father years before.  With Kenji and Taku's help, they defeat him, but Takeo loses 2 fingers, and goes into a delirium from the poisoned blade that cut him.  After he recovers, and despite the onset of winter, he rushes south to find what happened to Kaede.

A scientist, Dr. Jan Benes, working behind the Iron Curtain, has figured out how to make the process work indefinitely. With the help of American intelligence agents, including agent Charles Grant, he escapes to the West and arrives in New York City, but an attempted assassination leaves him comatose with a blood clot in his brain that no surgery can remove from the outside.\nTo save his life, Grant, Navy pilot Captain Bill Owens, medical chief and circulatory specialist Dr. Michaels, surgeon Dr. Peter Duval, and his assistant Cora Peterson are placed aboard a Navy ichthyology submarine at the Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces (CMDF) facilities. The submarine, named Proteus, is then miniaturized to \"about the size of a microbe\", and injected into Benes' body. The team has 60 minutes to get to and remove the clot; after this, Proteus and its crew will begin reverting to their normal size, become vulnerable to Benes's immune system, and kill Benes.\nThe crew faces many obstacles during the mission. An undetected arteriovenous fistula forces them to detour through the heart, where cardiac arrest must be induced to, at best, reduce turbulence that would be strong enough to destroy Proteus. The crew faces an unexplained loss of oxygen and must replenish their supply in the lungs. They notice \"rocks\" that are actually carbon particles from smoke. Grant finds the surgical laser needed to destroy the clot was damaged from the turbulence in the heart, as it was not fastened down as it had been before: this and his safety line snapping loose while the crew was refilling their air supply lead Grant to suspect a saboteur is on the mission. The crew must cannibalize their wireless radio to repair the laser, cutting off all communication and guidance from the outside, although because the submarine is nuclear-powered, surgeons and technicians outside Benes's body are still able to track their movements via a radioactive tracer, allowing General Alan Carter and Colonel Donald Reid, the officers in charge of CMDF, to figure out the crew's strategies as they make their way through the body.\nThe sub enters the lymphatic system, but the reticular fibres started to interfere. The crew is then forced to pass through the inner ear, requiring all outside personnel to make no noise to prevent destructive shocks, but while the crew is removing reticular fibers clogging the submarine's vents and making the engines overheat, a fallen surgical tool causes the crew to be thrown about and Peterson is nearly killed by antibodies, but they are able to reboard the submarine in time. By the time they finally reach the clot, the crew has only six minutes remaining to operate and then exit the body.\nBefore the mission, Grant had been briefed that Duval was the prime suspect as a potential surgical assassin, but as the mission progresses, he instead begins to suspect Michaels. During the surgery, Dr. Michaels knocks out Owens and takes control of Proteus while the rest of the crew is outside for the operation. As Duval finishes removing the clot with the laser, Michaels tries to crash the submarine into the same area of Benes' brain to kill him.

Fleischer had originally studied medicine and human anatomy in college before choosing to be a movie director. Harry Kleiner was brought in to work on the script.The budget was set at $5 million. The budget went up to $6 million, $3 million of which went on the sets and $1 million on test footage.The Proteus submarine was constructed as a full-size set piece 42 feet long, first seen in the \"miniaturizer\" room and later in scenes set outside the lung and inside the inner ear, when the cast was to be seen \"swimming\" (actually suspended by wires) outside the submarine. The full-size Proteus mockup contained all the interior sets that the actors are seen in to represent the interior of the submarine, with sections that could be pulled out to allow for cameras and crew to film the interior. The submarine was also constructed in miniature, including a large miniature around five feet in length that could be flown on wires in the abstract sets representing the inside of the human body. The heart and brain sets built to accommodate the five-foot miniature filled a soundstage on the Fox lot\u2014these were filmed \"dry for wet,\" with floating, blob-shaped elements meant to be blood cells filmed separately and composited over the footage. A smaller, 18-inch miniature of the Proteus was constructed to operate in liquid for a shot of the submarine bursting through an arterial wall early in the movie. A tiny Proteus miniature just a few inches in length was made for the miniaturization sequence to show the ship being picked up by a \"precision handling device\" and dropped into a large glass cylinder which was then miniaturized to become part of a syringe that would inject the Proteus into the brain-injured scientist.The film starred Stephen Boyd, making his first Hollywood movie in five years. It was the first role at Fox for Raquel Welch, who was put under contract to the studio after being spotted in a beauty contest by Saul David's wife.For the technical and artistic elaboration of the subject, Fleischer asked for the collaboration of two people of the crew that he had worked with on the production of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the film he directed for Walt Disney in 1954. The designer of the Nautilus from the Jules Verne adaptation, Harper Goff, also designed the Proteus; the same technical advisor, Fred Zendar, collaborated on both productions.At one point in the movie's preproduction it was positioned as one of the Derek Flint spy spoof movies starring James Coburn, which were produced by 20th Century Fox and Saul David.

The idea was that, after death, they would dissect each other and (hopefully) show a direct relationship between brain shapes and sizes and the character, abilities and intelligence of individuals. The book argues that this strange scientific pact, and anthropology itself, which the group's members helped to develop, had its genesis in aggressive, evangelical atheism.Essentially, The End of the Soul is a study of science and atheism in France in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. It illustrates how anthropology grew in the context of an impassioned struggle between the forces of tradition, especially the Catholic faith, and those of a more freethinking modernism, and posits that it became for many a secular religion. Among the figures discussed are novelist \u00c9mile Zola, statesman Leon Gambetta, American birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, and Arthur Conan Doyle.The End of the Soul received the Ralph Waldo Emerson Award for 2004 from the Phi Beta Kappa Society as a book that \"is an important contribution to knowledge, serious scholarship with a broad pertinence to the human condition.\"\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

The first book in the series, Over Sea, Under Stone, was originally conceived as a stand-alone novel, and the sequence gets its name from the second novel in the series, The Dark Is Rising. The Dark Is Rising Sequence is used as an over-arching title in several omnibus, boxed-set, and coordinated editions; but the title of The Dark is Rising is also used for the whole series.\nThe books depict a struggle between forces of good and evil called \"The Light\" and \"The Dark\", and draw upon Arthurian legends, Celtic mythology, Norse mythology and English folklore. Both magical and ordinary children are prominent throughout the series. It was inaugurated in 1965 with the U.K. publication by Jonathan Cape of Over Sea, Under Stone. The sequels were published 1973 to 1977, almost simultaneously in the U.K. and the U.S. Volume four, The Grey King (1975), won both the Newbery Medal, recognizing the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\", and the inaugural Tir na n-Og Award for English-language books with Welsh background. The concluding Silver on the Tree (1977) also won the annual Tir na n-Og Award.The novel The Dark Is Rising features Will Stanton, age 11, who learns on that birthday that he is one of an ancient magical people called \"Old Ones\", and is destined to wield the powers of The Light in the ancient struggle with The Dark.

While on a holiday in Cornwall, they get caught up in the battle between the Light and the Dark and join the search for the Things of Power. In the first novel, Over Sea, Under Stone, they search for the legendary Grail of King Arthur. They also appear in the third book, Greenwitch, and the last book in the series, Silver on the Tree. In the poem featured prominently throughout The Dark Is Rising, they are the ones referred to as \"three from the track\". Their surname is linked with Will Stanton's in British paleohistory; see Stanton Drew stone circles.\n\nSimon Drew: Simon is the eldest of the Drews. In Over Sea, Under Stone, Simon and Barney are the two to go into the cave and retrieve the Grail. In Greenwitch, he is jealous of Will because Merriman brought him to Cornwall for \"unnecessary\" reasons, but eventually warms to him. He loves sailing and anything to do with ships.\nJane Drew: Jane is the middle Drew. In Greenwitch, Jane is allowed to attend the Greenwitch ceremony, which is traditionally for female locals only, and through her compassion develops a special bond with the entity which constitutes the magical aspect of the Greenwitch. She subsequently receives from the entity the case containing the coded manuscript for deciphering the runes on the Grail. She also develops a special bond with the Lady of the Light in Silver on the Tree.\nBarnabas (Barney) Drew: Barney is the youngest of the Drews. He loves Arthurian legends and, although he is quite wary of his talent at first, paints. In Greenwitch, Barney sketches a picture of the bay, which is later stolen by an agent of the Dark, but Merriman recovers it and presents it to Tethys as a gift.Old Ones: Ancient and immortal, the Old Ones are mystical beings who possess great magical power. They are found in all parts of the world and are of many races and cultures. Capable of performing seemingly impossible feats, including freezing time and controlling the elements, they serve the Light in the war against the Dark. The Great Lords of the Dark have many similar characteristics and abilities but are not Old Ones. The two factions struggle to determine the destiny of mankind; while the Light fights for freedom and free will, the Dark fights for chaos, confusion and the subversion of man's agency.\nWill Stanton: The main character of the second novel, and a major character in the remaining novels of the series, he is the seventh son of a seventh son, in a large, close human family. His eleventh birthday marks the beginning of his magical awakening and rise to power as the last of the Old Ones. The Dark Is Rising tells how he came to power, met Merriman Lyon, and accumulated the six \"signs\" to help fight the Dark. Will is the last of the Old Ones; no others will be born after him. In Greenwitch, he is invited to come to Cornwall by Merriman in order to help recover the Grail and cypher that reveals how to read the runes on the Grail. He later gives Jane a bracelet of gold engraved with the words \"power from the Greenwitch\", which she throws into the sea as an offering to the Greenwitch in appreciation for its help. In The Grey King, Will goes to Wales to recover from sickness, where he meets Bran and awakens the Sleepers. In Silver on the Tree, Will travels with Bran to the Lost Land to recover the crystal sword Eirias, and helps to vanquish the Dark. Will is the only Old One to remain on Earth afterward, and the only one of the Light's allies who remembers the struggle against the Dark; in this, he is referred to as \"the watchman\", staying behind to keep watch for any attempt by the Dark to return.\nCooper named Will after William Shakespeare.Merriman Lyon: The first Old One, Lyon shares a special bond with Will Stanton, last of the line. A friend of the Drew family for over a generation, he helps and protects Barney, Jane, and Simon as they quest for the Grail. They occasionally refer to him as \"Great Uncle Merry\" or \"Gumerry\". Throughout the series, Merriman is portrayed in numerous historical periods, but particularly as King Arthur's chief adviser, the mythical Merlin; in Silver on the Tree, Arthur calls him \"Mer Lion\", old English for \"my lion\".\nThe Lady: The Lady is the most powerful of the Light, an Old One of seemingly greater strength than Merriman. Gentle, wise and enigmatic, she is a pivotal figure throughout the series, appearing usually at important moments to turn the tide in the Light's favour. She is an especial friend and mentor to Will and Jane. At one point in The Dark Is Rising, Will Stanton makes a critical mistake during a battle with the Dark and is saved by the Lady. Merriman tells Will that the Lady on her own is the only one of the Light able to overcome the full power of the Dark, although at a great cost. The sacrifice by the Lady is a critical point in the Story because she is a key element of the battle. At a later high ceremony of Old Ones, the Lady is missing and Merriman tells Will that her depleted power prevents her arrival, and she is beyond their magic to rescue but will return. She represents the Lady of the Lake, or the Lady of Avalon, King Arthur's sister, as they both embark on Arthur's boat Pridwen in Silver on the Tree. The Lady, like King Arthur, is affiliated with The Light and the High Magic. In Silver on the Tree, she initially can only communicate with Jane Drew, the one girl among the Six, telling Jane they share a special bond in being female, and calls her \"Jane, Jana, Juno\", referring to Jana (in Roman mythology, a variant form of Diana) or Juno, the queen of the gods.\nThe Black Rider: One of the great Lords of the Dark, comparable to Merriman in power and influence. The Rider is the major nemesis of Will during his many trials. He patronises John Wayland Smith's establishment, where he meets Will for the first time and attempts to bring him over to the Dark. He is given one name by the humans in the story: Mitothin (a name connected with the j\u00f6tunn Loki, who helps bring about Ragnarok).\nThe White Rider: Another servant and Lord of the Dark, introduced in Silver on the Tree. The White Rider is almost equal in power to the Black Rider, and despite being feminine in her true form, often affects a masculine guise while attacking agents of the Light. She is revealed as disguising herself as Blodwen Rowlands, an \"aunt\" figure to Bran Davies. She acts kind and caring, to keep an eye on Bran while developing emotional bonds, while controlling events around Cader Idris, which means \"chair of Arthur\", and the Sleepers. Will Stanton hypothesized that the monochromatic 'colour' of the White Rider's robes, like those of the Black Rider, reflected the extremism of their evil\u2014either darkened by their ignorance, or blinded by the brightness of their ideas.\nThe Walker: A human who betrayed the Light and was cursed to carry the Sign of Bronze, one of six Things of Power that repel the Dark, through the centuries until the last Old One claimed it from him. The Walker was once Hawkin, a liege man and foster son of Merriman during the 13th century. His betrayal of the Light stemmed largely from Merriman's acceptance of Hawkin's willingness to sacrifice his life to protect the Book of Gramarye, the secrets of which the human Hawkin can neither possess nor partake of. In The Dark Is Rising, his appearance in Will Stanton's town precipitates Will's \"awakening\" and rise to power. He presents Will with his second sign.\nThe Sleepers: Ancient knights who served during the time of King Arthur. In The Grey King, they are awakened from a mystic slumber by the Harp of the Light, to ride against the Dark during the final battle in Silver on the Tree.\nPendragon: This is a reference to two characters. First, it is the figurative title referring to status as a leader, of several traditional Kings of the Britons, notably Arthur. It is also his son in this series, Bran Davies, who is predestined to wield the Crystal Sword of Light that is vital to the final conflict with the Dark. Bran Davies is brought forward in time by Merriman at the request of his mother, Guinevere, who feared that Arthur would reject Bran as a true son because of Guinevere's affair with Lancelot. Bran is an albino, meaning he has very pale skin and white hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes, but his eyes are an unusual tawny colour. Will meets him in Wales during The Grey King, where they wake the Sleepers using the Harp. In Silver on the Tree, Bran and Will travel to the Lost Land and recover the sword Eirias.\nThe rooks: The majority of these birds are servants of the Dark and attract their forces wherever they are seen.\nFarmer Dawson: An Old One who lives near Will Stanton and presents him with his first Sign.\nJohn Wayland Smith: Another Old One who lives near Will Stanton; he is also a skilled smith. Though he is affiliated with the Light, he aids all who pass in his smithy. It is suggested that he might be Wayland the Smith of Germanic mythology.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_28261", "text": "Things of Power: The Old Ones have four Things of Power that will be used in the final battle which will allow them to defeat the Dark: the circle of Signs, the Grail, the Harp, and the Sword.

Greenwitch is the story of the recovery of the stolen Grail.\n\nThe Signs: A set of six circles quartered (divided evenly in four sections) by crosses. The six signs are each made of a different material and represent a different element: wood, bronze, iron, water, fire, and stone. The six Signs represent the Six champions of the Light, referred to in the recurring Poem of the Dark Is Rising series, as \"three from the Circle, three from the Track\". The signs have the power to repel the Dark.\nThe Grail: Made in imitation of the Holy Grail from the King Arthur legends, it is an artefact of power used by the Light. There are markings on it in a writing similar to Ogham, which is long lost. It is eventually translated by the Old Ones, thanks to a coded manuscript inside a metal case held by the Greenwitch.\nThe Harp (the harp of gold): A golden harp that is obtained by Will Stanton and Bran Davies from a triumvirate of the High Magic by answering three riddles. The Light uses it in The Grey King in order to wake the Sleepers in preparation for the final battle. Whoever plays the harp creates powerful music that negates any magic, through the protection of the High Magic.\nThe Crystal Sword: A magical sword, commissioned by the Light, crafted in the magical Lost Lands by the Lost King. It is named Eirias; therefore, \"blazing\", also called sword of the sunrise. In the presence of the Dark, it burns with blue fire. It can cut portals through magical barriers, as seen in Silver on the Tree, and is encased in a magical scabbard of invisibility.

This is connected to Coleridge experiencing both suffering and guilt over what he described later as his loss of innocence. In \"Easter Holidays\", Coleridge describes the time of innocence as in the past although others that he attends school with are still joyful and innocent.However, discussion of beauty within \"Easter Holiday\", along with the hopeful conclusion of the poem, reveals a further influence by Neoplatonistic works, especially Plotinus's Enneads. Of Plotinus in particular, Coleridge derived his understanding of wisdom as the soul being awakened to the knowledge of God and truth.

Soon, Johnson found employment with Edward Cave, and wrote for his The Gentleman's Magazine.According to Walter Jackson Bate, his work for the magazine and other publishers \"is almost unparalleled in range and variety\", and \"so numerous, so varied and scattered\" that \"Johnson himself could not make a complete list\". During this time, Johnson was exposed to the \"imitations\" of Horace composed by Pope and saw how they were used to attack contemporary political corruption. Both the form and subject were popular, and Johnson decided to follow Pope's lead by creating his own imitation.In May 1738, London was published anonymously, and it went into a second edition that year. This was his first major work to be published to a wide audience and one of his longest \"non-dramatic public poems\".

The work was based on Juvenal's Third Satire which describes Umbricius leaving Rome to live in Cumae in order to escape from the vices and dangers of the capital city. In Johnson's version, it is Thales who travels to Cambria (Wales) to escape from the problems of London. Johnson chose Juvenal as a model based on his own appreciation for Juvenal's works. The epigraph from Juvenal, \u201cQuis ineptae [iniquae] / Tam patiens urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat se?\u201d (Juv. 1.30-1) can be translated as \u201cWho is so patient of the foolish [wicked] city, so iron-willed, as to contain himself?\u201d.\nThe poem describes the various problems of London, including an emphasis on crime, corruption, and the squalor of the poor. To emphasise his message, these various abstract problems are personified as beings that seek to destroy London. Thus, the characters of Malice, Rapine, and Accident \"conspire\" (line 13) to attack those who live in London.The poem begins:\n\nWho Thales represents is unknown, but it is possible that he represents Richard Savage, Johnson's friend who left London to travel to Wales.The main emphasis of the poem comes to light on line 177: \"Slow rises worth, by poverty depressed\".The poem is forced to cut short, and the narrator concludes:", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_28322", "text": "Johnson judged his own poem harshly; he revised it in 1748 and came to depreciate the genre of poetic imitations of which London was an example.

However, his contemporaries did not agree with his later assessment, and Alexander Pope from the first claimed that the author \"will soon be d\u00e9terr\u00e9\", although it did not immediately happen. This would be the second time that Pope directly praised a work of Johnson. Not everyone praised the work, as its political themes did cause controversy within the Hanoverian government and with the supporters of Walpole's administration. Johnson was not to receive recognition as a major literary figure until a few years later when he began to work on his A Dictionary of the English Language.The printer and bookseller Robert Dodsley bought the copyright from Johnson for \u00a310. Later, London would be rated as his second greatest poem, as The Vanity of Human Wishes would replace it in the eyes of Walter Scott and T. S. Eliot. The later critic Howard Weinbrot agreed with Scott's and Eliot's assessment, and says \"London is well worth reading, but The Vanity of Human Wishes is one of the great poems in the English language.\" Likewise, Robert Folkenflik says: \"It is not Johnson's greatest poem, only because The Vanity of Human Wishes is better\". Some critics, like Brean Hammond, only see the poem as \"no better than a somewhat mechanical updating of Juvenal's third Satire\".

What they do not realize is that no one is reading the book; the owners of the bookstore are selling packets of cocaine in hollowed-out paperback copies of Shuffle, trusting that no legitimate customer will ask for such an obscure title.  Unfortunately, the publicity campaign sparks a reading at the store with Krunkleton as the guest speaker, where the cocaine in the books is discovered and the owners are forced to close and flee the county.\nThe owners - five former KGB agents dismissed from intelligence work for gross stupidity - are then recruited by \"Mr. Grande\", the head of the Mierda Cartel (the smallest in the world) to track down a briefcase containing $5 million in cash that was accidentally paid out by the insurance company that was laundering the Cartel's earnings.  The briefcase was last seen at the conclusion of Hammerhead Ranch Motel, in the possession of private investigator Paul and Ernest Hemingway-impersonator Jethro Maddox.  Also on the trail of the briefcase are Serge and his traveling companion, Don Johnson-impersonator Lenny Lipowicz.\nThe briefcase changes hands several times, and Paul, Jethro, and several of the Russians are killed, before their leader, Ivan, finally gets the briefcase from Serge (who was hoping to use the money to buy a trip into space and a monogrammed spacesuit from the Russians) and takes it to New York planning to buy a former Soviet submarine that Mr. Grande has promised to a larger, Colombian cartel for drug trafficking.  Serge leaves Lenny at his mother's home and follows Ivan's trail to New York.\nWhile searching for the briefcase, Serge encounters five single mothers from Miami, who have been best friends since college and now formed a book club.

Searching the attendant's apartment, Ivan and a Jamaican gang leader, \"Zig-Zag\", hear a message on his answering machine confirming the train booking.\nHijinks ensue aboard the train, which has been set up as a mystery tour loosely based on one of Krunkelton's books.  These include Ivan and Zigzag jumping their car onto the roof of the train from an overhanging bridge, and Serge feverishly searching the train's staterooms for the briefcase.  In the finale, the train derails, and Serge, \"in character\" as the mystery tour's detective, dramatically announces that one of the other actors, a washed-up hypnotist named Preston, was actually murdered rather than killed in the crash.

Crixus, however, survives and manages to rejoin Spartacus, now humbled and willing to follow his command. They establish a camp outside the coastal city of Thurium. The inhabitants, largely descended from Greek colonists conquered by Rome, are sympathetic to the rebels and feed them.\nSpartacus, now styling himself Imperator, negotiates a truce with the ruling council of Thurium; the threat of his army coerces the councilors to grant the rebels all of their demands.

He also realized the importance of the property of unique factorization (assured by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, first studied by Euclid), which he restates and proves using modern tools.\nFrom Section IV onward, much of the work is original.

Section VI includes two different primality tests.

In it Gauss discussed congruences of arbitrary degree, attacking the problem of general congruences from a standpoint closely related to that taken later by Dedekind, Galois, and Emil Artin.

This was later interpreted as the determination of imaginary quadratic number fields with even discriminant and class number 1, 2, and 3, and extended to the case of odd discriminant.

Invited back to his place, there they meet and befriend Bat Jarvis, come to retrieve his cat.

After a failed attempt to ask for a million wishes, he settles on three: A powerful Elven sword named Cinlach, super speed to get out of the desert, and the \"well of souls,\" an assassin tool.\nGenie gives him the wishes. But to give them, she has to take them from somewhere. Cinlach comes from an Elven Warduke named Ailwon Sann Fenlach, who quickly notices it missing. He is a veteran of many long-ago wars against the Orcs even if age and time have worn down his fighting acumen. Sann Fenlach has his mage transport him to Lusiphur's location in the desert where he challenges the elf to a duel for stealing his property. At first the Fenlach is winning, due in part to his mage immediately fixing any wounds Lusiphur can inflict.\nThe turning point comes when a magician named Tenth steps in. Tenth was quietly reading in his study when he felt a temporary shock. The genie drained his power to accommodate Lusiphur's request for super speed. Tenth also pinpoints where Lusiphur is located and sees that he is currently fighting Sann Fenlach. He also sees the disparity in the fight. Lusiphur is a young but experienced assassin, having to fight for everything he ever had. The High Lord is sedentary, fighting his last significant battle hundreds of years ago. In the meantime he has been sitting on his throne recounting past battles. Tenth sees that he is relying too much on the magical connection and severs it.\nAfter Lushiphur defeats the High Lord when the odds are more even, he starts burying the body. Tenth then arrives to take back the small sliver of power that Lusiphur took from him. Tenth wants it to be a fair contest however. Lusiphur could best Tenth in a physical contest and Tenth could destroy Lusiphur quickly if he chose. The wizard has not had a challenge in a while, and so decides to make a sport of it.\nIn \"Tenth's Game,\" the Elf is given a fighting chance: Make it across 50 meters through an arch. If he does he will survive. His only weapon is a temporary power of shape-changing into animals given to him by Tenth. The wizard promises to only use his shape-changing powers in return.\nThe two play a cat-and-mouse game, Lusiphur at one point turning into panther-like creature to fend off Tenth who had become a hawk. Tenth turns to a fly, so Lusiphur turns to a rattle snake, but he cannot figure out how to move a rattlesnake. This was when Tenth turns to a Unicorn, causing Lusiphur to panic and he chose a Nightmare (A black batwinged unicorn that bleeds acid and breathes fire.) Tenth becomes a Drake, where as Lusiphur turns to a black Dragon, knocking Tenth into a mountain. After recovering Tenth becomes a gold dragon, the two fight. Lusiphur gets his teeth on Tenth's throat. Up to this point in his existence Tenth has thoroughly beaten any competitor. Lusiphur has made the wizard fear for his life for the first time in many years. The dragon battle drags on, until Lusiphur disappears. Tenth assumes he is dead and scans the ground for his body. As Tenth searches for Lusiphur's body, he tries to go through the gate as a dragon, but he finds he can't fit. So Tenth becomes a Hell hound and goes through the gate, the moment he crosses it, Lusiphur appears out of nowhere and nearly carves Tenth's heart out.

And occasionally pause. . . .\" In The New York Times Book Review, Thomas R. Edwards deemed End Zone an improvement over Americana and said that the writing \"is continuously energetic, shifty, fun to watch for its own sake.\u201d Edwards also argued that \"[Gary's] fever, casually introduced in the final paragraph, hints at the uncertain but possible value of vulnerability, persisting without certitude in a world where others accept defensive systems \u2014technologies, religion, games, the large or small cultisms that flourish where fear is.\u201dAnya Taylor at The City University of New York argued the book would endure, especially praising Gary's desert meditation on the end zone. Taylor discussed how the novel dramatizes certain limitations of language and negative social phenomena involving language (such as the covering of unpleasant truths through euphemisms, or the prevention of meaningful interaction through over-reliance on simplistic maxims), and interpreted the novel as \"a book about the decline of language under the bombardment of terms from thermonuclear warfare, and an attempt to revive language through an ascetic disciplined ritual of silence and self-loss\". Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of The New York Times stated that End Zone confirmed DeLillo as one of the best young writers of his time, writing that the author was skilled at building scenes for comedic effect and praising the football game that is considered the novel's centerpiece as well as the pick-up game in the snow.Bill Beckett of The Harvard Crimson was less positive. While writing that End Zone has perhaps the best extended account of a football game ever written, and that the novel shows the author's \"golden ear for the tin and tinsel of Americanese\", Beckett also argued that \"even isolated good satire can't hold together a disappointingly anticlimactic novel. DeLillo's buildup of suspense finally dissipates totally; many ominous hints are lost or forgotten by the end. [...] A season in the chaotic life of Gary Harkness, interesting as he is, does not suffice to make a satisfying whole.\"Chad Harbach lauded End Zone in 2004 as \"a wonderful and underrated novel\". Daniel Roberts highly praised the novel in a 2018 retrospective for The Paris Review, where he wrote, \"No novel nails the omnipresent violence of football better than End Zone\".

The aunt has the second ability, and teaches Ani to speak with birds, mainly swans. Ani grows to be more comfortable at the pond than in the palace. When her aunt leaves, Ani is forced to abandon her unique talent. At age sixteen, she devotes herself to preparing to be the next Queen of Kildenree, but finds solace in communicating with her horse, Falada.

It was originally published in The New Yorker in 1962. Ted Hughes stated that the poem was written about a bouquet of tulips Plath received as she recovered from an appendectomy in the hospital. The poem consists of nine seven-line stanzas and has no rhyme scheme. Its subject is relatively straightforward: a woman, recovering from a procedure in a hospital, receives a bouquet of tulips that affront her with their glaring color and vividness. She details how they bother her, insisting she prefers to be left alone in the quiet whiteness of her room.\n\u201cTulips\u201d is a rich and evocative poem. Plath contrasts the whiteness and sterility of the hospital room with the liveliness of the tulips. Regarding the former, she explains \u201chow white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.\u201d There, she is \u201cnobody\u201d amidst a sea of faceless nurses who bring \"no trouble.\" She is frequently numbed by medications, and has lost all of her \"baggage.\" She is but a \u201cthirty-year-old cargo boat\u201d whose former life has disappeared. In other words, she treasures whiteness and sterility because they allow her an existence devoid of any self, in which she is defined by no more than the feeling she has at any particular moment. She has no context.\nThe tulips work against her desire to \"lie with [her] hands turned up and be utterly empty.\u201d She personifies them with excitability, loud breathing, and eyes that watch her as she rests. Her choice of adjectives \u2013 \"excitable,\" \"red,\" vivid\" \u2013 all imbue them with a sense of liveliness. They are dangerous and alluring like an African cat. Even their color reminds her of her wound, which implicitly suggests it reminds her of her past.\nThe main tension in the poem, therefore, is between the speaker\u2019s desire for the simplicity of death and the tulips\u2019 encouragement toward life. What attracts her to the sterility of the hospital room is that it allows her to ignore the complications and pains of living. Her \u201cloving associations\u201d have been stripped away, and she feels pure and peaceful. The feelings suggested by her description of the room are hibernation, dormancy, and detachment. Here, she does not have a \u201cself.\u201d She does not have to worry about her family, the pressures of being a woman, her education, etc. Perhaps the harshest image in the poem is that of her husband and child in a picture frame. For the average reader, this is the image we expect to encourage an invalid towards life, but she considers it as simply another factor of annoying encouragement. The tulips thrust themselves in front of her with all of the brazenness of life. They not only watch her but also insist that she watch them. By bringing warmth and noise to the room, they demand she acknowledges the vivacity of life. One critic described the effect of the tulips on the speaker as the feeling one experiences when his or her leg begins to prickle with feeling after having fallen asleep.\nThe choice she must make is to either embrace death or painfully return to life. Most critics seem to agree that she chooses the latter. Marjorie Perloff writes that \u201cin her anxiety, [Plath] equates the tulip petals with the \u2018red blooms\u2019 of her heart which insists on beating despite her desire for death. Finally, life returns with the taste of her hot tears; health is a \u2018far away\u2019 country but at least now it is remembered. The spell of the hospital room is broken.\u201d In other words, she comes to realize that life is her natural state and that she will fight for it instinctively in the way her heart beats instinctively. Pamela Annas bases her argument on the organization of stanzas. She notes how, in the first four stanzas of the poem, the speaker \u201c[describes] the world of the hospital in the yearning tones of one who has already turned her back on it and knows it is slipping away,\u201d and in the fifth, she begins referring to her wish to stay in the past tense. In other words, the verb tenses and tone suggest the speaker is slowly accepting her decision through the poem, rather than actively making the choice.\nM.D. Uroff agrees, seeing the end of the poem as a tentative return to health, but also views the poem as an expression of the mind's ability to \u201cgenerate hyperboles to torture itself.\u201d In other words, he does not want the general interpretation \u2013 that the speaker chooses life \u2013 to distract from the harshness of her perspective towards life. Barbara Hardy concurs, writing that the tulips are \u201cinhabitants of the bizarre world of private irrational fantasy, even beyond the bridge of distorted science: they contrast with the whiteness of nullity and death, are like a baby, an African cat, is like her wound (a real red physical wound, stitched to heal, not to gape like opened tulips) and, finally, like her heart;\u201d yet they, more than anything else, are what brings her back to life. It is safe to assume that without them, she would have remained ensconced in her bed, enjoying her lifelessness. The irony of the tulips is that they save her by torturing her, by forcing her to confront a truth that she otherwise would ignore in favor of the easier lifelessness. What this interpretation implies, then, is that the choice of life is necessarily a difficult and painful one, whereas death is not itself a choice but rather simply a refusal to continue living.\nThe speaker is in a hospital bed and describes her experience using an image of red tulips (presumably a gift) that interrupt her calm stay in the white hospital.\nDuring her stay at the hospital she has given up everything, including her identity, as expressed by the lines:\n\nI am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.\nI have given my name and my day clothes up to the nurses\nAnd my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.\n\nShe wishes to remain in a state of emptiness, but the flowers intrude upon this state:\n\nI didn't want any flowers, I only wanted\nTo lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.\n\nEileen Aird remarks: \"The world of Ariel is a black and white one into which red, which represents blood, the heart, and living is always an intrusion.\" Ren\u00e9e R. Curry takes this further by claiming the tulips signify \"by their glorious and bold colors, glaring Otherness.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

They reject the idea that Marvell's poem carries a serious and solemn mood. Rather, the poem's opening lines\u2014\"Had we but world enough, and time/ This coyness, Lady, were no crime\"\u2014seems to suggest quite a whimsical tone of regret. In the second part of the poem, there is a sudden transition into imagery that involves graves, marble vaults and worms. The narrator's use of such metaphors to depict a realistic and harsh death that awaits the lovers seems to be a way of shocking the lady into submission. As well, critics note the sense of urgency of the narrator in the poem's third section, especially the alarming comparison of the lovers to \"amorous birds of prey\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_28503", "text": "At least two poets have taken up the challenge of responding to Marvell's poem in the character of the lady so addressed. Annie Finch's \"Coy Mistress\" suggests that poetry is a more fitting use of their time than lovemaking, while A.D. Hope's \"His Coy Mistress to Mr. Marvell\" turns down the offered seduction outright.Many authors have borrowed the phrase \"World enough and time\" from the poem's opening line to use in their book titles. The most famous is Robert Penn Warren's 1950 novel World Enough and Time: A Romantic Novel, about murder in early-19th-century Kentucky. With variations, it has also been used for books on the philosophy of physics (World Enough and Space-Time: Absolute versus Relational Theories of Space and Time), geopolitics (World Enough and Time: Successful Strategies for Resource Management), a science-fiction collection (Worlds Enough & Time: Five Tales of Speculative Fiction), and a biography of the poet (World Enough and Time: The Life of Andrew Marvell). The phrase is used as a title chapter in Andreas Wagner's pop science book on the origin of variation in organisms, \"Arrival of the Fittest\". The verse serves as an epigraph to Mimesis, literary critic Erich Auerbach's most famous book. It is also the title of an episode of Big Finish Productions's The Diary of River Song series 2, and of part 1 of Doctor Who's Series 10 finale. It is the title of a Star Trek New Voyages fan episode where George Takei reprises his role as Sulu after being lost in a rift in time. The title of Robert A. Heinlein's 1973 novel Time Enough for Love also echoes this line.\nAlso in the field of science fiction, Ursula K. Le Guin wrote a Hugo-nominated short story whose title, \"Vaster than Empires and More Slow\", is taken from the poem. Ian Watson notes the debt of this story to  Marvell, \"whose complex and allusive poems are of a later form of pastoral to that which I shall refer, and, like Marvell, Le Guin's nature references are, as I want to argue, \"pastoral\" in a much more fundamental and interesting way than this simplistic use of the term.\" There are other allusions to the poem in the field of Fantasy and Science Fiction: the first book of James Kahn's \"New World Series\" is titled \"World Enough, and Time\"; the third book of Joe Haldeman's \"Worlds\" trilogy is titled \"Worlds Enough and Time\"; and Peter S. Beagle's novel A Fine and Private Place about a love affair between two ghosts in a graveyard. The latter phrase has been widely used as a euphemism for the grave, and has formed the title of several mystery novels.\nBrian Aldiss's novel Hothouse, set in a distant future in which the earth is dominated by plant life, opens with \"My vegetable love should grow / vaster than empires, and more slow.\"\nTerry Pratchett opens his poem An Ode to Multiple Universes with \"I do have worlds enough and time / to spare an hour to find a rhyme / to take a week to pen an article / a day to find a rhyme for \u2018particle\u2019.\"The phrase \"there will be time\" occurs repeatedly in a section of T. S. Eliot's \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" (1915), and is often said to be an allusion to Marvell's poem. Prufrock says that there will be time \"for the yellow smoke that slides along the street\", time \"to murder and create\", and time \"for a hundred indecisions ... Before the taking of a toast and tea\".  As Eliot's hero is, in fact, putting off romance and consummation, he is (falsely) answering Marvell's speaker.  Eliot also alludes to the lines near the end of Marvell's poem, \"Let us roll all our strength and all / Our sweetness up into one ball\", with his lines, \"To have squeezed the universe into a ball / To roll it toward some overwhelming question,\" as Prufrock questions whether or not such an act of daring would have been worth it. Eliot returns to Marvell in The Waste Land with the lines \"But at my back in a cold blast I hear / The rattle of the bones\" (Part III, line 185) and \"But at my back from time to time I hear / The sound of horns and motors\" (Part III, line 196).\nThe line \"deserts of vast eternity\" is used in the novel Orlando: A Biography, by Virginia Woolf, which was published in 1928.\nArchibald MacLeish's poem \"You, Andrew Marvell\", alludes to the passage of time and to the growth and decline of empires. In his poem, the speaker, lying on the ground at sunset, feels \"the rising of the night\". He visualizes sunset, moving from east to west geographically, overtaking the great civilizations of the past, and feels \"how swift how secretly / The shadow of the night comes on.\"\nB. F. Skinner quotes \"But at my back I always hear / Time's wing\u00e8d chariot hurrying near\", through his character Professor Burris in Walden Two, who is in a confused mood of desperation, lack of orientation, irresolution  and indecision. (Prentice Hall 1976, Chapter 31, p. 266). This line is also quoted in Ernest Hemingway's novel A Farewell to Arms, as in Arthur C. Clarke's short story, The Ultimate Melody.\nThe same line appears in full in the opening minutes of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death (1946), spoken by the protagonist, pilot and poet Peter Carter: 'But at my back I always hear / Time's wing\u00e9d chariot hurrying near; And yonder all before us lie / Deserts of vast eternity. Andy Marvell, What a marvel'.\nPrimo Levi roughly quotes Marvell in his 1983 poem \"The Mouse,\" which describes the artistic and existential pressures of the awareness that time is finite.

The voyages of Christopher Columbus, seeking a westerly route to the riches of the Indies, began in the summer of the same year, and on 12 October Columbus sighted land in the West Indies which he believed to be part of India. He returned to Spain, with news of what he had found, in March 1493. Columbus's discoveries in the annus mirabilis created a competitive frenzy between the two principal sea-powers of the day, Portugal and the new Spanish kingdom based in Castile and Aragon.\nA papal bull delivered on 4 May 1493, Inter caetera, attempted to divide the non-Christian world beyond Europe between Portugal and Spain, from the point of view of future conquests. Among much else, it states: Among other works well pleasing to the Divine Majesty and cherished of our heart, this assuredly ranks highest, that in our times especially the Catholic faith and the Christian religion be exalted and be everywhere increased and spread, that the health of souls be cared for and that barbarous nations be overthrown and brought to the faith itself ...you should appoint to the aforesaid mainlands and islands worthy, God-fearing, learned, skilled, and experienced men, in order to instruct the aforesaid inhabitants and residents in the Catholic faith and train them in good morals. This papal command signalled the beginning of the Spanish colonization of much of the New World. An important, although accidental, effect of the combination of this papal bull and of the Treaty of Tordesillas was that nearly all of the Pacific Ocean and the west coast of North America (the existence of both of which was still unknown) were allotted to Spain. However, it is still unclear whether the pope was issuing, so far as he could, a gift of sovereignty or a feudal infeodation or investiture. Differing interpretations have been argued.The Spanish are thought to have requested an extension to what they had already been granted by the pope because they foresaw that there were richer territories still to be discovered than those which were yet known. In August 1493 the Portuguese ambassadors P\u00earo Dias and Rui de Pina were in Barcelona negotiating with the Spanish over several issues, including the Portuguese intention to send a fleet to the New World to capture the islands discovered by Columbus, when Ferdinand and Isabella sent an appeal to the pope which resulted in the granting of Dudum siquidem, dated 26 September.The day before, on 25 September, Columbus had sailed from C\u00e1diz on his second voyage of exploration, at the head of a fleet of seventeen ships containing some 1,200 people.

In view of that, the pope adds to his previous grants to Ferdinand and Isabella ...just as if in the aforesaid letters full and express mention had been made thereof, we do in like manner amplify and extend our aforesaid gift, grant, assignment, and letters, with all and singular the clauses contained in the said letters, to all islands and mainlands whatsoever, found and to be found, discovered and to be discovered, that are or may be or may seem to be in the route of navigation or travel towards the west or south, whether they be in western parts, or in the regions of the south and east and of India.

The specific mention of India caused consternation in Portugal, which mounted a diplomatic campaign aimed at damage limitation.

Tonya is later found and rushed to the hospital while Pete and Billy Ray are heard bragging at a roadside bar about their crime. Tonya's outraged father, Carl Lee Hailey, consults his friend Jake Brigance, a white attorney who had previously represented Hailey's brother, on whether he could get himself acquitted if he killed the two men.  Jake tells Carl Lee not to do anything stupid, but admits that if it had been his daughter, he would kill the rapists. Carl Lee is determined to avenge Tonya, and while Pete and Billy Ray are being led into holding after their bond hearing, he kills both men with an M16 rifle.\nCarl Lee is charged with capital murder. Despite efforts to persuade Carl Lee to retain high-powered attorneys, he elects to be represented by Jake. Helping Jake are two loyal friends, disbarred attorney and mentor Lucien Wilbanks, and sleazy divorce lawyer Harry Rex Vonner. Later, the team is assisted by liberal law student Ellen Roark, who has prior experience with death penalty cases and offers her services as a temporary clerk pro bono. Ellen appears to be interested in Jake romantically, but the married Jake resists her overtures. The team also receives some illicit behind-the-scenes help from black county sheriff Ozzie Walls, a figure beloved by the black community and also well respected by the white community who upholds the law by arresting Carl Lee but, as the father of two daughters of his own, privately supports Carl Lee and gives him special treatment while in jail and goes out of the way to assist Jake in any way he legally can. Carl Lee is prosecuted by Ford County's district attorney, Rufus Buckley, who hopes that the case will boost his political career. It is claimed that the judge presiding over Carl Lee's trial, Omar \"Ichabod\" Noose, has been intimidated by local white supremacist element--a fact given further credence when, despite having no history of racist inclinations in his rulings, Noose refuses Jake's request for a change of venue, even though the racial make-up of Ford County virtually guarantees an all-white jury, which later becomes the case.\nBilly Ray's brother, Freddy, seeks revenge against Carl Lee, enlisting the help of the Mississippi branch of the Ku Klux Klan and its Grand Dragon, Stump Sisson. Subsequently, the KKK attempts to plant a bomb beneath Jake's porch, leading him to send his wife and daughter out of town until the trial is over. Later, the KKK attacks Jake's secretary, Ethel Twitty, and kills her frail husband, Bud. They also burn crosses in the yards of potential jurors to intimidate them. On the day the trial begins, a riot erupts between the KKK and the area's black residents outside the courthouse; Stump is killed by a Molotov cocktail. Believing that the black people are at fault for Stump's death, the KKK increase their attacks. As a result, the National Guard is called to Clanton to keep the peace during Carl Lee's trial. The KKK shoots at Jake one morning as he is being escorted into the courthouse, missing Jake but seriously wounding one of the guardsmen assigned to protect him. Soon after, Ellen Roark is abducted and assaulted. They burn down Jake's house.  During trial deliberations, the jury's spokesman is threatened by a KKK member with a knife. Eventually, they torture and murder \"Mickey Mouse\", one of Jake's former clients who had infiltrated the KKK and subsequently gave anonymous tips to the police, allowing them to anticipate most KKK attacks.\nDespite the loss of his house and several setbacks at the start of the trial, Jake perseveres. He badly discredits the state's psychiatrist by establishing that he has never conceded to the insanity of any defendant in any criminal case in which he has been asked to testify, even when several other doctors have been in consensus otherwise. He traps the doctor with a revelation that several previous defendants found insane in their trials are currently under his care despite his having testified to their \"sanity\" in their respective trials, at which point the flustered doctor blurts out \"You just can't trust juries,\"--thus alienating the jury he was testifying to. Jake follows this up with a captivating closing statement, ignoring Lucien's advice to use a pre-prepared statement he had written for Jake.\nOn the day of the verdict, tens of thousands of black citizens gather in town and demand Carl Lee's acquittal. After a long and contentious deliberation, in which the jurors have to contend with one particularly racist member of the panel who openly insists on using the \"N\"-word routinely during the deliberations, a unanimous acquittal by reason of temporary insanity is finally achieved when one of the jurors asks the others to seriously imagine that Carl Lee and his daughter were white and that the murdered rapists were black, and polling the jury by secret ballot on the question of whether they would kill the rapists in such a case.  After finding this question to be answered with a unanimous \"yes,\" the jury finally acknowledges that they must hold a black father to the same, equal standard of justice and mercy.

The \"women\" of the title were in fact heroines, many of whom lay with gods, bearing the heroes of Greek mythology to both divine and mortal paramours. In contrast with the focus upon narrative in the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey, the Catalogue was structured around a vast system of genealogies stemming from these unions and, in M. L. West's appraisal, covered \"the whole of the heroic age.\" Through the course of the poem's five books, these family trees were embellished with stories involving many of their members, and so the poem amounted to a compendium of heroic mythology in much the same way that the Hesiodic Theogony presents a systematic account of the Greek pantheon built upon divine genealogies.\nMost scholars do not currently believe that the Catalogue should be considered the work of Hesiod, but questions about the poem's authenticity have not lessened its interest for the study of literary, social and historical topics. As a Hesiodic work that treats in depth the Homeric world of the heroes, the Catalogue offers a transition between the divine sphere of the Theogony and the terrestrial focus of the Works and Days by virtue of its subjects' status as demigods. Given the poem's concentration upon heroines in addition to heroes, it provides evidence for the roles and perceptions of women in Greek literature and society during the period of its composition and popularity. Greek aristocratic communities, the ruling elite, traced their lineages back to the heroes of epic poetry; thus the Catalogue, a veritable \"map of the Hellenic world in genealogical terms,\" preserves much information about a complex system of kinship associations and hierarchies that continued to have political importance long after the Archaic period. Many of the myths in the Catalogue are otherwise unattested, either entirely so or in the form narrated therein, and held a special fascination for poets and scholars from the late Archaic period through the Hellenistic and Roman eras.\nDespite its popularity among the Hellenistic literati and reading public of Roman Egypt, the poem went out of circulation before it could pass into a medieval manuscript tradition and is preserved today by papyrus fragments and quotations in ancient authors. Still, the Catalogue is much better attested than most \"lost\" works, with some 1,300 whole or partial lines surviving: \"between a third and a quarter of the original poem\", by one estimate. The evidence for the poem's reconstruction\u2014not only elements of its content, but the distribution of that content within the Catalogue\u2014is indeed extensive, but the fragmentary nature of this evidence leaves many unresolved complexities and has over the course of the past century led to several scholarly missteps.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_28547", "text": "Ancient authors most commonly referred to the poem as the Catalogue of Women, or simply the Catalogue, but several alternate titles were also employed. The tenth-century encyclopedia known as the Suda gives an expanded version, the Catalogue of Heroic Women (\u0393\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f29\u03c1\u03c9\u03ca\u03bd\u1ff6\u03bd \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2), and another late source, the twelfth-century Byzantine poet and grammarian Tzetzes, prefers to call the poem the Heroic Genealogy (\u1f29\u03c1\u03c9\u03ca\u03ba\u1f74 \u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1). But the earliest and most popular alternative title was Ehoiai (\u1f28\u03bf\u1fd6\u03b1\u03b9), after the feminine formula \u0113' hoi\u0113 (\u1f20' \u03bf\u1f35\u03b7, Ancient: [\u025b\u02d0 h\u01d2i\u032f.\u025b\u02d0]), \"or such as\", which introduces new sections within the poem via the introduction of a heroine or heroines. This nickname also provided the standard title for a similar Hesiodic work, the Megalai Ehoiai or Great Ehoiai (\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f28\u03bf\u1fd6\u03b1\u03b9).As is reflected by its use as an alternate title, the \u0113' hoi\u0113-formula was one of the poem's most recognizable features. It may have belonged originally to a genre of poetry that simply listed notable heroines, but in the Catalogue the formula is used as a structuring tool that allows the poet to resume a broken branch of a family tree, or to jump horizontally across genealogies to a new figure and line of descent. A characteristic example is found in the introduction of the daughters of Porthaon at Cat. fr. 26.5\u20139:\n\nThe preceding section of the poem had dealt at some length with the extended family of Porthaon's sister Demodice, tracing her line down to the generation following the Trojan War. Here \u0113' hoiai (plural) is used to jump backwards in order to complete the account of the descendants of Porthaon and Demodice's father Agenor by covering the son's family. Elsewhere the formula is used in transitions to more distant branches. The Ehoie of Mestra, for example, ultimately serves to reintroduce the family of Sisyphus, Mestra's great-granduncle who hoped to win her as bride for his son Glaucus. Although that marriage does not take place, the descendants of Sisyphus are soon presented.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_28548", "text": "According to the Suda, the Catalogue was five books long. The length of each is unknown, but it is likely that the entire poem consisted of anywhere from 4000 to over 5000 lines. The majority of the content was structured around major genealogical units: the descendants of Aeolus were found in book 1 and at least part of book 2, followed by those of Inachus, Pelasgus, Atlas and Pelops in the later books. It is believed that a rough guide to this structure can be found in the Bibliotheca, a Roman-era mythological handbook transmitted under the name of Apollodorus of Athens which used the Catalogue as a primary source for many genealogical details and appears to have followed the poem's overall arrangement.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_28549", "text": "During antiquity the Catalogue was almost universally considered the work of Hesiod. Pausanias reports, however, that the Boeotians living around Mount Helicon during his day believed that the only genuine Hesiodic poem was the Works and Days and that even the first 10 lines of that poem (the so-called \"hymn to Zeus\") were spurious. The only other surviving expression of doubt is found in Aelian, who cites \"Hesiod\" for the number of Niobe's children, but qualifies his citation with \"unless these verses are not by Hesiod, but have been passed off falsely as his, like many other passages.\" But Aelian's skepticism could have stemmed from the belief, still common today, that Hesiodic poetry was especially susceptible to  interpolation, and it is impossible to tell whether he regarded the entire Catalogue as spurious or not. These two passages are, in any event, isolated, and more discerning critics like Apollonius of Rhodes, Aristophanes of Byzantium and Crates of Mallus apparently found no reason to doubt the attribution to Hesiod, going so far as to cite the Catalogue in arguments concerning the content and authenticity of other Hesiodic poems.\nModern scholars have not shared the confidence of their Hellenistic counterparts, and today the Catalogue is generally considered to be a post-Hesiodic composition. Since Hesiod is supposed to have lived around the turn of the seventh century BCE, the Cyrene-Ehoie alone could guarantee that the poem was not his.\nRichard Janko's survey of epic language, on the other hand, suggests that the Catalogue is very early, nearly contemporary with Hesiod's Theogony, and Janko sees no reason why the Catalogue \"should not be by the same poet as the Theogony,\" who \"calls himself Hesiod.\" But a different critical strain, one which views the transmitted Homeric and Hesiodic poems as ultimate products of rhapsodic recomposition within an oral tradition, would hold that from an initial Hesiodic nucleus the Catalogue arrived at its final form well after period to which Hesiod has been assigned. Such a scenario could account for perceived anachronisms in the mythological content and in the linguistic character of the poem, but would sidestep the issue of the relation between the Catalogue as it has been transmitted and the broader corpus of early Greek epic.M. L. West argues on poetic, linguistic, cultural and political grounds that an Athenian poet \"compiled the Catalogue of Women and attached it to Hesiod's Theogony, as if it were all Hesiodic,\" sometime between 580 and 520 BCE, and thinks it possible that this range might be narrowed to the period following 540. He sees, for example, the marriage of Xuthus to a daughter of Erechtheus as a means of subordinating all of Ionia to Athens, since their union produced the eponym Ion. Similarly, Sicyon is made a son of Erechtheus (fr. 224), which West takes as a reflection of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon's attempts to promote Ionian\u2013Athenian interests in the polis, which had traditionally been more closely connected to Dorian Argos. These and other considerations would, in West's view, establish a terminus post quem of c.\u2009575 BCE, but he prefers a later dating on the assumption that Theogony 965\u20131020, which he assigns to the latter portion of the sixth century BCE, was contemporaneous with the composition of the Catalogue.West's arguments have been highly influential, but other scholars have arrived at different conclusions using the same evidence. Fowler thinks that the Sicyon genealogy would more likely reflect a composition before Cleisthenes' death (c. 575 BCE) and dates the poem to the period closely following the First Sacred War (595\u2013585 BCE), connecting its content to the growing influence of the Amphictyonic League and placing its author in Aeolian Thessaly because of the Aeolid family-trees centered around that region which dominate the earlier portions of the poem. Hirschberger, on the other hand, takes this focus upon the Aeolids and the Catalogue poet's perceived interest in eastern peoples to be indicative of a poet from Aeolis in Asia Minor; she proposes that the Catalogue was composed there between 630 and 590 BCE, viewing the composition of the Shield of Heracles and an apparent allusion to the poem by Stesichorus (died c. 555 BCE) as providing the ultimate terminus ante quem.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_28550", "text": "The Catalogue's greatest influence was felt during the Hellenistic period, when the poem was used as an extra-Homeric touchstone for the poets of the era who favored recondite and antiquarian references over direct engagement with the more prominent members of the canon. The most famous Hellenistic allusion to the Catalogue is found in Hermesianax's Leontion, which included a catalogue of great literary figures and their loves, beginning with Orpheus and Agriope (more commonly known as Eurydice) and proceeding down to the poet's contemporaries, including his teacher Philitas of Cos. Many of the entries engage playfully with their subjects' work: Homer, for example, is portrayed as pining for Penelope. Directly preceding that lovestruck bard comes Hesiod's blurb:\n\nHere the \u0113' hoi\u0113-formula is styled as the name of a woman, cleverly rendered \"Anne Other\" by Helen Asquith, and the grumpy Hesiod who reviled his home in Ascra at Works and Days 639\u201340 becomes a discomfited lover-boy in the village. Phanocles, a near contemporary of Hermesianax, composed an elegiac catalogue of mythological pederastic relationships entitled the Loves or Beautiful Boys in which each story was introduced by the formula \u0113' h\u014ds (\u1f20' \u1f61\u03c2), \"or like\". Nicaenetus of Samos, a later Hellenistic poet, wrote his own Catalogue of Women and the otherwise unknown Sosicrates (or Sostratus) of Phanagoria was said to have written an Ehoioi (\u1f28\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9), the masculine equivalent of \"Ehoiai\". While allusions to the ehoie-formula and catalogue structure of the poem are most easily recognized, interaction with the Catalogue in Hellenistic poetry was not limited to plays upon these aspects: direct engagement with the myths found in the Catalogue were a popular way for the Alexandrians to show their Hesiodic affiliations.At Rome the poets of the Late Republic and Augustan age continued the Hellenistic period's allusive engagement with the Catalogue. Catullus, a poet who made plain his Callimachean affiliations, is the earliest Roman author who can be seen to engage with the Catalogue. In his epyllion on the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, Catullus alludes to the theoxeny that the proem to the Catalogue presented as a defining characteristic of the heroic age and to the epithalamium of the couple that was sung in a later book. In the Aeneid Vergil closes his catalogue of combatants with the swift female warrior Camilla, alluding to the Hesiodic account of Iphiclus' speed in \"a remarkably subtle nod to tradition in the best Alexandrian style.\" Ovid picked up on Vergil's allusion in the Metamorphoses with his treatment of Atalanta, which recast's his Roman forebear's allusion to Iphiclus in such a way that it highlights the Hesiodic character of his own poem in contrast with the Homeric character of the Aeneid.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This leads to Jack being suspicious of her having an affair.\nIn the novel, Julia showed Jack a video of Xymos nanobots being injected into a human test subject leaving Jack impressed yet suspicious of the new technology.

He is shown a machine used to make nanobot assemblers from bacteria, though isn't shown the source code for said nanobots. Ricky claims that contractors improperly installed filters in a vent, causing assemblers, bacteria, and nanobots to be blown into the desert, where they began forming into autonomous swarms. These \"swarms\" appear to be clouds of solar-powered self-sufficient nanobots, reproducing and evolving (necroevolution) at rapid speeds. The swarms exhibit predatory behavior, killing wild animals through the use of a code that Jack had worked on. Jack learns Julia was helping to make the swarms more benign, but they regressed when she stopped coming to the facility. \nPersuaded by Jack, the team decides to destroy the swarm, but are overwhelmed and retreat as the swarm injures and kills several members.

The group follows Rosie's body and find the swarms nesting in a cave and destroy the swarms, their nest, and their organic assembly plant using explosive thermite caps.\nReturning to the plant, Jack, Mae, and Bobby are greeted by Julia, who had discharged herself from the hospital and acts strangely as the remaining team looks for the cause of the nanobots' escape. Mae discovers security footage of when they were in the desert. To Jack's horror, the video reveals that Julia and Ricky had an affair, and shows Charley engaging in a vicious fight with Ricky and Vince. All of them end up in the communications room where Julia kisses a subdued Charley, injecting a swarm into his mouth. Jack and Mae realize that Julia, Ricky, Vince and Bobby have all been infected by a symbiotic version of the nanobot swarms. These swarms do not show aggressive predatory behavior; instead, they take over human hosts, affecting their decision-making, and slowly devour them over time to produce more nanobots. This allows the swarms to remain hidden, while also allowing them to spread and contaminate other humans.\nJack comes up with a plan to destroy this new strain. He and Mae drink vials containing a form of phage that kills the nanobot-producing E. coli bacteria, thereby protecting them from infection by the nanobots. Jack then takes a sample of the phage and plans to pour it into the sprinkler system to vaccinate everyone in the facility. He has Mae alert Julia and the infected team, who set out to stop Jack. In the struggle that ensues, Jack is captured and thrown into a magnetic chamber. Jack feigns surrender when Julia walks in to interrogate him, but reactivates the magnetic chamber, remembering the incident with Amanda in the MRI. Julia's swarm is pulled away by the magnetic field to temporarily reveal the real Julia, who is gradually being consumed by the parasitic swarm. Before the swarm can repossess her body, Julia begs Jack to forgive her, says she loves him, and tells him to stop the swarms and save their children, as they have been infected too.

His work was later used by the German army to produce the chlorine gas used in the Second Battle of Ypres in the First World War. As Dr. Haber becomes increasingly involved with the German army, the play depicts how his actions and newly forged military connections affect his relationship with his wife, Clara, and his assistant, Otto. As his passion for science intertwines with nationalistic pride, Haber manifests himself as a scientist devoted to a country that never accepted his Jewish origin.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_28559", "text": "Einstein's Gift is a memory play that loosely recounts the life of Dr. Fritz Haber from 1905 until his death in 1934. The play is presented as the memories of Albert Einstein as he looks back upon Haber's life. Through the interactions of Einstein, Haber, Haber's two wives, scientific colleagues and political and military minders, it addresses the connections between pure and applied science, faith and nationalism, and imagination and knowledge. Fritz Haber was a Nobel Laureate and German chemist. Haber converted from Judaism to Christianity to help further his scientific career as even at that time in Germany there existed discrimination against Jewish people. He was the co-inventor of the Haber\u2013Bosch process. The process, used to make ammonia, revolutionized the production of agricultural fertilizer. This invention helped to prevent the starvation of millions of people. However, he was also involved in the use of chlorine gas by the German military. This gas was used in as a weapon in Ypres during World War I. Haber's lab also developed the cyanide-based pesticide Zyklon A, predecessor to the infamous Zyklon B.\nThe first act works to develop the meaningful yet complicated relationship between the characters Einstein and Haber, drawing upon the dynamic differences between both their scientific and moral principles. Morals that are discussed between (Albert) Einstein and Haber during this act include nationality, religion/faith, and what it means to change these factors in one's life; for example, Haber does not fully embrace Christianity, but is baptized so that he can increase his chances of gaining professorship. Haber's decision to get a baptism is motivated by his career goals. This not only demonstrates his devotion to science, but also his ambition to acquire fame and recognition as a scientist.\nVery early on, it is established that Einstein and Haber are each other's foil, both with a very different outlook on life and the future of science. While Einstein does not care much for his nationality and cultural identity, Haber, who is strongly nationalistic, feels obliged to serve his country. In the opening scene, Haber praises the German education system as \"the best in the world\", while Einstein retorts that being a German born and raised was \"no privilege for [him]\", detesting the structure and interconnecting the differing stances the two brilliant scientists have on nationality and scientific belief (Thiessen 10). Their differing views arise later, as the two once again find themselves at odds with each other through their contrasting perspective on the sciences \u2013 Haber scoffs at the impracticality of physics, while Einstein views chemistry as unimaginative. Their differing views regarding science's involvement in war create tension between the pacifist Albert Einstein and the war involved Haber. Haber argued that, if he were to assist the military in the production and utilization of lethal chlorine gas, the war would come to an end sooner due to the gas's effectiveness in trench warfare. Einstein, however, reasoned that science should, under no circumstances, be used for such purposes.\nIn addition to the discrimination towards religion that is addressed in the play, there is the topic of prejudice towards women in the early twentieth century. Focussing on the scientific community as women began to advance into the many fields of science, it is represented in the play through the chemist and Fritz Haber's wife Clara Immerwahr, the first woman to receive a PhD from the University of Breslau. Clara was also Jewish and of German descent.\nThiessen presents non-stereotypical scientists with varying points of view toward their disciplines: Haber is willing to compromise his faith, the people in his life, and morals to further his career ambitions through practical use of science; Haber's wife Clara practices science to serve the greater good through applications of her work; Einstein believes that science is composed of ideas and imagination; and Otto only wishes to make a difference. In this play, the clash of these scientists\u2019 ideologies is explored through their relationships. On one hand, Haber's views differ with his assistant, Otto, who, in act one, is portrayed as an idealistic young man who truly believes that science will yield a better future, and desires no power or recognition for his efforts; Haber, on the other hand, issues a command, by order of General Deimling of the German Army, to release chlorine gas, causing the death of several enemy soldiers, fearing he would be stripped of his precious titles and posting if he did not comply. Haber's drive to advance his career by developing chemical warfare also places a great deal of strain on his relationship with his wife, Clara Immerwahr. Clara and Haber both believe in the practical application of science. But, Clara is more interested in serving \"greater humanity\" while Haber is more concerned with helping his own country, furthering his career and, in Clara's eyes, gaining recognition. This causes Clara to constantly challenge Haber.

Otto, Haber's assistant, notices that Haber will do whatever it takes to further his career even if that involves murdering other men. This is supported by Deimling's comment: \"Well done, Haber.

The book is an epistolary and chronicles Junior's life from the start of the school year to the beginning of summer. It includes both Junior's written record of his life and his cartoon drawings, some of them comically commenting on his situations, and others more seriously depicting important people in his life.\nBorn with hydrocephalus, Junior is small for his age and suffers from seizures, poor eyesight, stuttering, and a lisp, making him a frequent bullying target for others on the reservation. Junior's only friend is Rowdy, who is abused at home. Despite his reputation as a bully on the reservation, Rowdy often stands up for Junior and they bond over their shared love of comics. Junior's family is extremely poor and has limited access to opportunities. When Junior's dog Oscar gets heat stroke, his father must put him down by shooting him as they cannot afford a veterinarian.\nOn the first day of school, Junior discovers his mother's name written in his textbook and realizes how old the book must be. Angered and saddened that the reservation is so poor it cannot afford new textbooks, Junior violently throws the book, inadvertently hitting his teacher, Mr. P, and breaking his nose. While visiting Junior at home, Mr. P convinces him to transfer to another high school, sensing a degree of precociousness in him. Junior elects to attend Reardan, a school in a much wealthier neighborhood with no other Indian students. Despite his family's financial situation, they do what they can to make it possible for him to attend. Rowdy, however, is upset by Junior's decision to transfer, and they gradually begin to cease contact.\nJunior develops a crush on popular girl Penelope and starts befriending  the straight-A student Gordy. His interactions with the white students give him more perspective on both white culture and his own, and he finds himself torn between pressures to fit in at Reardan and his sense of loyalty to his Indian heritage. He realizes how much stronger his family ties are than those of his white classmates, noticing that many of the white fathers never attend school events. Junior also realizes that the white students have different rules than those he grew up with, evident when he reacts to an insult from the school's star athlete, Roger, by punching him in the face, as would be expected of him on the reservation. To his surprise, Roger never seeks revenge, and in fact only ends up respecting Junior more after the incident. Junior also grows closer to Penelope, which soars his popularity as the \u2018almost boyfriend\u2019 of the most popular girl in the school.\nRoger suggests that Junior should try out for the basketball team. To Junior's surprise, he makes the varsity team, which pits him against his former school, Wellpinit, and Rowdy, who is Wellpinit's star freshman. When Junior enters the court for his first match, his former schoolmates boo and insult him. Junior suffers some injuries from the game, namely from Rowdy knocking him unconscious, but his coach commends his commitment to the team.\nLater on, Junior's grandmother is hit and killed by a drunk driver. After her funeral, a family friend, Eugene, is shot in the face by his friend Bobby while both are intoxicated and fighting over the last sip of alcohol. Later, Reardan wins their second match against Wellpinit. Junior feels triumphant until he sees the look of defeat on the Wellpinit players' faces and remembers the lack of hope he had for his future while growing up on the reservation. Ashamed, he runs to the locker room, vomits, and breaks down sobbing. Later, Junior receives news that his sister and her husband were killed in a fire at their trailer.\nThe tragedies that afflict Junior and his family, though forcing him to question his future and ponder the darker aspects of reservation culture, reaffirm his love for his family and friends, and he eventually learns to identify as both Indian and American.

The novel started as a section of Sherman Alexie's family memoir, but after the persistence of a young adult editor, he decided to use it as a basis for his first young adult novel.  Sherman Alexie commented, \"If I were to guess at the percentage, it would be about seventy-eight percent true.\" Like Arnold, Sherman Alexie grew up on the Spokane Reservation in Wellpinit with an alcoholic father. He was also born with hydrocephalus, but Alexie did not have any speech impediments. Alexie was also teased for his government-issued, horn-rimmed glasses and nicknamed \"The Globe\" by fellow students because of his giant head. Another similarity between Alexie and his character Arnold is that Alexie also left the reservation to attend high school at Reardan High, but Alexie chose to go to Reardan to achieve the required credits he needed to go to college. Alexie became the star player of Reardan's basketball team and was the only Indian on the team besides the school's team mascot. The scene where Arnold finds that he is using the same textbook his mother did thirty years before he is drawn from Alexie's own experiences. The only difference between Alexie's life and the novel is that Alexie threw the book against the wall out of anger, and did not hit anyone as Junior did.In his own writing, Alexie unapologetically describes himself as \"kind of mixed up, kind of odd, not traditional. I'm a rez kid who's gone urban, and that's what I write about. I have never pretended to be otherwise.\" \"A smart Indian is a dangerous person,\" Alexie states in a personal essay, \"[a smart Indian is] widely feared and ridiculed by Indians and non-Indians alike.\" Junior encapsulates this type of experience when he receives strong censure both from his tribal community and from his peers and teachers at his new school, Reardan. In the personal story, Alexie's continued explanation of his own experience is reflected in Junior's. Alexie recalls, \"I fought with my classmates on a daily basis. They wanted me to stay quiet when the non-Indian teacher asked for answers\u2026.[W]e were Indian children who were expected to be stupid. \u2026[W]e were expected to fail in the non-Indian world.\" Through Junior's success at Reardan and his realizations about life on the reservation, Alexie represents a possibility for the success of Native American children\u2014by defeating the expectation that he is doomed to fail, Junior defeated what he thought he couldn't.

Upon meeting Junior, Roger uses racial slurs to demean him, and eventually it gets so racist that Junior retaliates by punching him in the face. Contrary to Junior's expectations, Roger then begins to respect Junior, and the two gradually become friends. Furthermore, Roger obtains a role as a kind of advisor and protector of Junior, occasionally helping him monetarily and other times with advice.\nRowdy\nRowdy is Junior's best friend. He is \"long and lean & strong like a snake.\" Throughout the novel, Rowdy's father abuses him, which leads to his bully-like behavior. He likes reading comics, such as Archie.

There is a single theme of immense importance to society played in innumerable variations throughout the whole work. There is a wealth of historical illustration and detail. There is a distinct view of society as a whole seen perhaps from a somewhat unfamiliar angle. And there is a wholly honorable passion for human betterment through intellectual clarification.:\u200a140\u200a\n\nBoulding stated that if a key word for economics is \"exchange,\" then the key word for nonviolent action is \"disobedience\" - \"One might almost call Gene Sharp's book, therefore... the discovery of disobedience, especially of large-scale disobedience.... nonviolent action is concerned with the institutionalization of a threat-defiance system.\":\u200a141\u200a A key to this process, Boulding argues, is the \"dynamics of legitimacy... [the] public denial of the legitimacy of some command,\":\u200a141\u200a which Sharp \"hints at many times,\" although Sharp \"never quite works [it] out in detail.\":\u200a141\u200a\nBoulding described Part II as \"in some ways... the meatiest and richest part of the work,\":\u200a142\u200a although he noted that Sharp's examples are drawn from \"quite restricted range\":\u200a142\u200a of human history:\n\nThere must be many examples from Chinese history; Latin America is hardly mentioned; and the European middle ages, with its extraordinary phenomenon of the \"Truce of God,\" receives hardly a mention. Nevertheless, Sharp's examples are broad and wide and illustrate the universality and significance of this phenomenon, which, simply because it has not had a name, has been grossly neglected by conventional historians.:\u200a142\u200a\n\nBoulding also reported some ways that Sharp's theoretical analysis seemed to be deficient, \"even in terms of what might be called 'classical' or Gandhian theories of nonviolence.\":\u200a142\u200a The book's analysis\n\nneglects the importance of \"Satyagraha\" or \"Truth-grasping,\" that is, the appeal of nonviolent action to some objective truth, even an objective moral truth, as the basic source of its legitimacy. In this sense nonviolent action is closer to the spirit of science than it is to the spirit of war, in that it is concerned... that truth should prevail no matter who wins. Sharp, perhaps in too great a reaction to the accusations of sentimental pacifism sometimes brought against nonviolence, has stressed the conflictual aspects of it perhaps to the exclusion of its integrative aspects.\":\u200a142\u20133\u200a\n\nIn International Organization, Bleicher's 21-page review stated that \"What Professor Sharp... has demonstrated is that our understanding of the dependency of governments upon the\ncontinuing consent of the governed can be translated into the development of nonviolent action as a strategy of change that is effective outside of established institutional arrangements and yet operates without the use of force.\":\u200a532\u200a He wrote that Sharp \n\nhas exposed the inadequacy of assuming the monolithic character of the nation state in international relations theory. Recognition of nonviolent action as a tool in the hands of governments and citizens to influence the policies of other nations and of international organizations calls for a fundamental re-evaluation of the critical parameters in the study and conduct of international relations.:\u200a532\u200a\n\nBleicher stated that the \"full utilization of this new understanding requires an expansion of the horizons of scholars and policy makers in the international arena, the collection and application of new data in the evaluation of international relations, and the development of new theoretical constructs.\":\u200a532\u200a He warned that if we do not develop a better understanding of phenomenon related to nonviolence, we face the danger that we will be progressively less able to... design policies and institutions that can cope with the future.\":\u200a532\u200aIn Political Theory, Carl J. Friedrich wrote that Sharp considers his view of power as \"much more original than it is,\":\u200a465\u200a and that the reviewer [Friedrich] found it \"exasperating to try and follow arguments with the drift of which he definitely sympathized, except for their alleged novelty.\":\u200a467\u200a In particular, Sharp does not\n\nrelate [his view of power] to such classics as Charles Merriam's magisterial treatment of power, or even Bertrand Russell's journalistic book on the subject. He seems unaware of the reviewer's [Friedrich's] analysis of many years ago, in which the distinction between two views of power, and the dependence of power on the cooperation of those over whom it is wielded, was analytically developed, and its root in the classics was shown.:\u200a465\u200a\n\nFriedrich also stated that a \"fundamental weakness\":\u200a465\u200a of Sharp's argument was his understanding of violence \"as physical violence,\":\u200a465\u200a since \"some of the most vicious forms of coercion are psychic.\":\u200a465\u20136\u200a Furthermore \"According to Sharp, violence by definition excludes demolition and destruction of things, such as machinery, buildings and the like. Hence, according to him, much sabotage is not violent; clearly at this point Sharp deviates markedly from popular usage.\":\u200a466\u200a Due to the \"illusory\":\u200a466\u200a nature of the distinction based on physical violence alone, Sharp is often \"confused,\":\u200a466\u200a although \"many thoughtful arguments are offered.\":\u200a466\u20137\u200a Friedrich concluded that \"the topic of how to avoid violence in political conflicts is an important one, the treatment given here is learned, but not very clear, and the results not conclusive,\" but that the book was a \"timely one\" that he hoped it will \"lead to further more searching studies.\":\u200a467\u200aIn The Western Political Quarterly, H. L. Nieburg wrote that he \"would like to see the work cut down to 125 pages and published in paperback as a token of new life for insurgency politics. But, this... should not deter one from the duty to welcome a monumental, competent, and sometimes exciting, work of scholarship.\":\u200a338\u200aIn Social Work, Harry Specht stated that \"Sharp has performed a useful service for students of community organizing by producing an encyclopedic description of nonviolent action,\" and that \"by shear weight of detail, the reader comes to recognize that nonviolent action has been far more pervasive than many assume.\":\u200a249\u200a Specht stated that the books flaws included \"repetition and excessive detail,\":\u200a249\u200a and that the book \"seems to imply that nonviolent action is usually undertaken by the oppressed against the state and that it is usually in the cause of positive social change. But... for example, I have just read of two massive nonviolent demonstrations in Boston, one for and the other against integration of the public schools.\":\u200a249\u200a Specht described an \"absence of a clear theoretical framework.... it does not illuminate such central questions as...

An important aspect of the novel is the relationships and connections between the various characters, such as the marriage of the main character and his wife, Linda Kall, and the feelings of jealousy and suspicion that may arise in a society with heavy surveillance and legal uncertainty.\nOne of the novel's central ideas coincides with contemporary rumors of truth drugs that ensured the subordination of every citizen to the state. Both Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) and Boye's Kallocain are drug dystopias, or societies in which pharmacology is used to suppress opposition to authority.

Among these epistles are some of the earliest extant Christian documents. They provide an insight into the beliefs and controversies of early Christianity. As part of the canon of the New Testament, they are foundational texts for both Christian theology and ethics.\nMost scholars believe that Paul actually wrote seven of the thirteen Pauline epistles (Galatians, Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Philemon, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians), while three of the epistles in Paul's name are widely seen as pseudepigraphic (First Timothy, Second Timothy, and Titus). Whether Paul wrote the three other epistles in his name (2 Thessalonians, Ephesians and Colossians) is widely debated. According to some scholars, Paul wrote the questionable letters with the help of a secretary, or amanuensis, who would have influenced their style, if not their theological content. The Epistle to the Hebrews, although it does not bear his name, was traditionally considered Pauline (although Rome questioned its authorship), but from the 16th century onwards opinion steadily moved against Pauline authorship and few scholars now ascribe it to Paul, mostly because it does not read like any of his other epistles in style and content and because the epistle does not indicate that Paul is the author, unlike the others.The Pauline epistles are usually placed between the Acts of the Apostles and the catholic epistles in modern editions.

The book also gives a sympathetic side to Olivia previously unseen in the other books.  However, Olivia's softer side was implied in Flowers in the Attic, when Cathy theorizes at one point, though briefly, that Olivia was trying to prevent them from eating the poisoned donuts their mother sets out for them, when Olivia agrees with Cathy's demands that the dying twin Cory be taken to a hospital (but he really wasn't), when Olivia gives them a plant, and when Christopher witnesses Olivia in prayer at the foot of her bed.\nThis book also clarifies the suspicious marriage of Corinne and John Amos (mentioned in If There Be Thorns), considering the latter's obvious disgust with incest. As Corinne is not Olivia's biological daughter, she and John Amos are not genetically related.\nAlso, this book examines Corinne's betrayal. It has stated in this book that she wanted to marry and have children, but her greedy side is shown in the other books, such as in If There Be Thorns, when Christopher states that Corinne wanted him to sue and get the money that was his. Her betrayal is likely due to the fact that she was spoiled by her father and grew up in wealth, so once the children were in the attic, she turned her attention toward getting her inheritance. Corinne conspired with Olivia to lock her children away and said (about waking the twins so they could walk, as Chris and Cathy were complaining about their arms aching from holding them), \"Lord knows, they'd better walk outside while they can.\" Corinne claims in Petals On the Wind that she did put arsenic on the doughnuts, but her plan was not to kill them\u2014it was to get the children sick one by one and take them out of the attic \"to the hospital,\" then come back and tell Olivia that they had died.

Cathy mentions that they had been in the attic for 3 years, 4 months, and 16 days (POTW- p 18). They left on 10 Nov 1960 meaning they arrived about 24 June 1957. Yet in Flowers in the Attic chapters \"Goodbye Daddy\" to \"Roads to Riches\", the dad dies in early May and it is implied that a few months passed before they abandoned the house in Gladstone. Also on page 231, it's mentioned that \"August had come and gone. We have been in this prison a full year.\"\nThe dollhouse that belongs to Olivia stays at her old house. There is no mention of it ever arriving at Foxworth Hall, as it does in Flowers in the Attic.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Christopher Sr. dies at age 36; in Garden of Shadows, he dies at age 35.

Differences lie in the location of death and who was present. (However, it is possible that Corrine either misremembered the circumstances regarding her brother\u2019s death as it had been years between his passing and her confession, or she lied to her children.)\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells her children that Joel ran away from home and sent a single postcard, while in Garden of Shadows, Olivia mentions many newspaper clippings were sent home.

This leads to a confrontation with Malcolm and Olivia, after which Christopher and Corrine willingly flee Foxworth Hall.\nIn Flowers in the Attic Corrine tells Cathy that she was 12, and out bike riding when she got her first period, while in Garden Of Shadows Corrine is 14 and proudly shares the news with her mother.\nGarden of Shadows does not mention Olivia's ever-present diamond brooch, nor any close friends that make her gray dresses (Flowers in the Attic). In fact, Garden of Shadows says that Olivia had no friends in Virginia, finding the women too weak, frivolous, and nasty for her liking.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, when confronted by Cathy, Corrine reveals that Malcolm wrote on a letter to her, in reply for her pleas for help after Chris Sr. dies, that the only thing good about their (Chris Sr. and Corrine's) marriage was the fact it didn't create any devil's issue (inbred children). In Garden of Shadows, Olivia says that she writes the letter, and Malcolm does not write anything on it. Also, Olivia does not let Malcolm know about the children, knowing that Malcolm would be bewitched by their beauty, especially the girls, and would not punish the children for the evil that their parents have done.

The earlier books in the series stated that he was known as \"Mel.\"\nGarden of Shadows shows that John Amos meets Corrine for the first time when she is 14, while it is mentioned in If There be Thorns that she was 10.\nIn Garden of Shadows, Christopher is named Christopher Garland Foxworth. In Flowers in the Attic, his name is Garland Christopher Foxworth the Fourth.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells the children that her parents had forced her and her brothers to attend church every Sunday no matter what. In Garden of Shadows, there is no mention of the family ever attending church.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells the children that she and her brothers were forbidden from being exposed to each other, which includes swimming together because her mother said it was a sin and was abused if they disobeyed. In Garden of Shadows, Olivia does not mind it and even lets Corrine swim with Christopher. There is no mention of Corrine being abused but the boys are disciplined by their father who whips them and verbally abuses them.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Olivia expresses hatred towards her grandchildren because of their incestuous conception, even physically and emotionally abusing them. In Garden of Shadows, she feels drawn to them and actually wanted to love them, but decided against it because of what their parents had done. She may be keeping this in mind in her treatment of the children in the first novel.\nIn Flowers in the Attic and in previous novels, Corrine maintains that she was abused by her father. But in Garden of Shadows, Corrine was doted on and spoiled by her father.

Queen Mab demands he undertake a job, but in return offers her aid with the parasite. Harry is to help Nicodemus steal something from the vault of Hades. Wary of the potential for betrayal, he enlists the aid of Karrin Murphy to watch his back.\nHarry and Karrin meet Nicodemus and his crew, which includes Binder and a female warlock, Hanna Ascher, and soon Anna Valmont, the only surviving member of the group of thieves who had stolen the Shroud of Turin in Death Masks. Harry accompanies Nicodemus's daughter Deirdre and the shape-shifting Goodman Grey to collect a sample from an insider, Harvey Morrison, who is quickly killed when Tessa unexpectedly intervenes. Dresden learns that the heist's target is the Holy Grail. At the third meeting, they realize that they are being spied upon by Waldo Butters. Giving chase, Harry manages to keep Binder's henchmen from catching him with the help of Bob. Nicodemus catches up with Dresden, Murphy and Butters on the street in front of Michael Carpenter's house, and a fight ensues. Murphy draws Fidelacchius and is tricked into using the sword to attempt to kill Nicodemus while defenseless, which results in the sword's shattering and Murphy being badly wounded. Michael then appears, offering to leave his angel-protected house in exchange for the release of Harry, Karrin and Butters. Nicodemus accepts the deal, but before Michael leaves, Uriel appears, giving Michael Amoracchius and his own Grace. Nicodemus surrenders the fight and agrees to accept Michael as Harry's replacement for the wounded Murphy. That night while recovering at the Carpenters', Harry reconnects with his daughter Maggie for the first time since he saved her life at Chichen Itza in Changes.\nAs the heist begins, the group breaks into a high security vault owned by John Marcone, where Dresden opens a Way to the true vault in the Nevernever. Ascher and Dresden open the gates of fire and ice respectively, leading the group to the Gate of Blood, where Deirdre willingly allows Nicodemus to sacrifice her to gain access to the vault. Dresden and Valmont manage to find an altar containing several powerful religious artifacts, including the Grail, at which point Hades stops time to talk to Dresden. Hades informs him that the vault is actually an armory: its purpose is to hold powerful artifacts and weapons until those with the knowledge and power to use them can claim them.\nArmed with this knowledge, Dresden hides three artifacts in Valmont's bag and one in his sleeve before Nicodemus and the others arrive to claim the Grail. Nicodemus takes the Grail but turns on Harry and Michael after Harry angrily calls him out on murdering his own daughter for his schemes, as Valmont has gone back to the vault's entrance. Hanna Ascher and the Genoskwa (an aggressive Bigfoot) are revealed to be the new hosts for Lasciel and Ursiel, respectively, and Nicodemus orders them and Goodman Grey to attack.\nIt is then revealed through a flashback that Harry had earlier hired Grey to back him up in anticipation of this fight. Grey takes on the Genoskwa/Ursiel, Dresden fights Ascher/Lasciel, and Michael fights Nicodemus after making a final appeal to his humanity. After Dresden manages to bury Ascher in a rockfall and Michael sends Nicodemus running, Grey blinds the Genoskwa, allowing the three of them to escape. On the way out, Dresden activates the Gate of Ice to crush the pursuing Genoskwa.\nDresden opens a Way and the four of them depart the Nevernever, but before they can close the Way, Nicodemus escapes and heads for Michael's house. With Binder's help, Harry and his team get out of Marcone's vault. Harry and Grey then leave to confront Nicodemus at Michael's home. During the final fight, Butters takes up the broken Fidelacchius, which emits a lightsaber-style blade, and chases off Nicodemus again. He agrees to become a Knight of the Cross. Molly Carpenter, Michael's daughter and Harry's former apprentice, now the new Winter Lady, arrives in time to safely remove the parasitic spirit from Harry's head.\nAfterwards, the group divide up the backpack full of diamonds Valmont stole from Hades' vault. Grey turns down a share of them, instead accepting one dollar from Harry as his fee, and Harry uses that share as a \"weregild\" to pay for the death of Marcone's vault guard. He then visits Karrin in the hospital and the two share a passionate kiss and agree to try an actual relationship.

These nations are the Confederate States of America (also containing several Caribbean possessions), the Free State of Louisiana (smaller than the real state of Louisiana, but containing the city of New Orleans), the remaining Northern states as the United States of America, the Republic of Texas (also includes portions of what was Mexico), the Great Spirit Alliance (called \"Tecumseh\" in the original series's map \u2014 also includes portions of Canada), the Mormon nation of Deseret, The People's Republic of California (including Baja California) and Pacifica (called \"Sequoyah\" in the original series's map \u2014 also includes portions of Canada). Canada and Mexico exist, but have lost territory to the various other nations.The means by which the CSA managed to retain its independence was never explained in the series. In the 2018 trade paperback edition, Shetterly's afterward explains that he purposefully omitted an in-universe explanation, because he wanted to let the readers' imagination decide this.\nEach of these nations has its own propaganda heroes similar to the original Captain Confederacy, though empowered through different means and technologies (armored suits, drugs, etc.). Canada exists in some form, although it is not as large as it is in the real world. A version of the Underground Railroad exists within the Confederacy to help oppressed minorities escape to either the United States or Canada.\nOutside North America, a Japan analogue, Nippon (a native name of Japan), exists as an ally to the People's Republic of California, having a military base there. Germany on the other hand, is a global power, with a system of militarized defensive satellites. A cold war of sorts exists between Germany and Nippon.\nThe technology of this world's 1967 (the year in which the story begins) seems analogous to the real world in about 1980. Although advanced technology was used to create the superheroes, it does not seem to be in widespread use by the general public. Dirigibles seem a common means of air transportation. The President of the Confederate States is a woman named Lee, hinted to be a descendant of Robert E. Lee. Miss Dixie calls the President \"aunt\" at one point, though it is not explained whether this implies blood relation or simply affection. Medical science also is about the same as 1980s medicine, but there is a complete separation of healthcare and state in that there is no single-payer. Anyone who can afford it has access to medicine, but due to the economic situation minorities receive less treatment in Confederate healthcare than do whites. Governments do not seem inclined to share their technological means.\nCommercially, McDonald's is known for its fast food burritos \u2014 although it has plans to introduce a new ground beef sandwich with cheese, while KFC sells catfish, not chicken. Both chains seem ubiquitous within the Confederacy.\nScience fiction is known by Scientifiction and appears more popular than in the real world. Margaret Mitchell wrote a well known book, Glorious Tomorrows, hinted to be an analog of Gone with the Wind but set in a victorious Dixie. The Beacon Hillbillies, an analog of The Beverly Hillbillies, is a television comedy popular in the USA that makes fun of the CSA.

After a traumatic difficulty in finding a family to foster them, they stay with a shopkeeper, Mr Evans, who dominates his gentle but weak younger sister, whom they call \"Auntie Lou\". Another evacuee whom Carrie has befriended, Albert Sandwich, is staying at a dilapidated country house called Druid's Bottom with Mr Evans's older sister, the dying Mrs Dilys Gotobed, and her disabled cousin, Mr Johnny Gotobed. Their English housekeeper, Hepzibah Green, is reputed to be a wise woman. Carrie and Nick become friends with Albert and Johnny and spend a lot of time there. The housekeeper tells the children many tales, including one about a curse on Druid's Bottom, which will be activated if a mysterious skull is removed from the house.\nIt is revealed that Mr Evans has been estranged from his older sister, Mrs Gotobed, after she married a wealthy Englishman whose family owned the mines where their father was killed in an accident. Carrie is caught in the rift between the brother and sister. Despite almost universal contempt for Mr Evans, Carrie gives him a chance and sees that, beneath his rough exterior, he genuinely is a well-meaning man, who became embittered with the world due to his hard life and the feud with his older sister, to whom he was once very close.\nWhen Mrs Willow comes to visit them, they say nothing about their dislike of Mr Evans, as they do not want to leave. Mrs Gotobed assures Hepzibah and Mr Johnny that they can continue to live in her house once she has died, and that she has made a will saying so. Carrie only meets Mrs Gotobed twice before she dies, and Mrs Gotobed asks Carrie to tell Mr Evans that she has never forgotten him, despite their feud. Hepzibah and Albert tell Carrie that despite Mr Evans's firm belief that Hepzibah is cheating Mrs Gotobed out of money, she is in fact penniless.\nOn Carrie's birthday, Albert kisses her as a present and she is delighted. Auntie Lou, meanwhile, becomes friendly with Major Cass Harper, an American soldier, keeping this secret from her brother, who would not approve. When Mrs Gotobed dies, Albert is sure that Mr Evans has stolen her will so that he can turn Hepzibah and Mr Johnny out of his deceased sister's house, despite there being plenty of evidence that Mrs Gotobed had made no will \u2013 only mental deterioration led her to believe she had made one. Johnny and Hepzibah will be homeless after a month's notice, as the house has become Mr Evans's property. Carrie does not want to believe this of Mr Evans, seeing him as an honest man. Albert, on the other hand, is convinced that Mr Evans has destroyed the will, and becomes even more adamant after he realises that a ring which Mr Evans gives Carrie as a present had in fact belonged to Mrs Gotobed.\nHowever, Carrie changes her mind about Mr Evans after Albert vaguely recalls seeing an envelope in Mrs Gotobed's jewellery box that disappeared after Evans visited the house to take an inventory of his late sister's belongings. This envelope, Carrie believes, was Mrs Gotobed's will, and she too thinks Evans stole it to ensure he would inherit everything. To prevent this from happening, she throws the cursed skull into the horse pond. Mrs Willow arranges a new home for her family near Glasgow, and so the children prepare to leave, with mixed feelings. At the same time, Auntie Lou departs to marry Major Harper, leaving Evans alone. Carrie later learns that Evans is innocent after all: the envelope in fact contained nothing more than a childhood photograph of Evans and Mrs Gotobed, which she had left him. Evans bought the ring he gave Carrie as a present for Mrs Gotobed in their youth. As the children leave by train, they see that Druid's Bottom is on fire. Carrie is guilt-stricken, believing it is her fault for casting out the skull.\nThirty years later, Carrie's children discover that Hepzibah and Mr Johnny are living in a converted barn at Druid's Bottom, having escaped the fire, which was seemingly accidental.

They were originally written in Middle French and published in the Kingdom of France. Montaigne's stated design in writing, publishing and revising the Essays over the period from approximately 1570 to 1592 was to record \"some traits of my character and of my humours.\" The Essays were first published in 1580 and cover a wide range of topics.The Essais exercised an important influence on both French and English literature, in thought and style.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "50_28725", "text": "Montaigne wrote in a rather crafted rhetoric designed to intrigue and involve the reader, sometimes appearing to move in a stream-of-thought from topic to topic and at other times employing a structured style that gives more emphasis to the didactic nature of his work. His arguments are often supported with quotations from Ancient Greek, Latin, and Italian texts such as De rerum natura by Lucretius and the works of Plutarch. Furthermore, his Essays were seen as an important contribution to both writing form and skepticism. The name itself comes from the French word essais, meaning \"attempts\" or \"tests\", which shows how this new form of writing did not aim to educate or prove. Rather, his essays were exploratory journeys in which he works through logical steps to bring skepticism to what is being discussed.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_28726", "text": "Montaigne's stated goal in his book is to describe himself with utter frankness and honesty (\"bonne foi\"). The insight into human nature provided by his essays, for which they are so widely read, is merely a by-product of his introspection. Though the implications of his essays were profound and far-reaching, he did not intend or suspect that his work would garner much attention outside of his inner circle, prefacing his essays with, \"I am myself the matter of this book; you would be unreasonable to suspend your leisure on so frivolous and vain a subject.\"Montaigne's essay topics spanned the entire spectrum of the profound to the trivial, with titles ranging from \"Of Sadness and Sorrow\" and \"Of Conscience\" to \"Of Smells\" and \"Of Posting\" (referring to posting letters). Montaigne wrote at the height of the French Wars of Religion (1562\u20131598) between Catholics and protestant Huguenots. Christianity in the 15th and 16th centuries saw Protestant authors consistently attempting to subvert Church doctrine with reason and scholarship. Consequently, some Catholic scholars embraced skepticism as a means to discredit all reason and scholarship and accept Church doctrine through faith alone.Montaigne never found certainty in any of his inquiries into the nature of man and things, despite his best efforts and many attempts. He mistrusted the certainty of both human reason and experience. He reasoned that while man is finite, truth is infinite; thus, human capacity is naturally inhibited in grasping reality in its fullness or with certainty. Though he did believe in the existence of absolute truth, he believed that such truth could only be arrived at by man through divine revelation, leaving us in the dark on most matters. He finds the great variety and volatility of human nature to be its most basic features, which resonates with Renaissance thought about the fragility of humans. According to the scholar Paul Oskar Kristeller, \"the writers of the period were keenly aware of the miseries and ills of our earthly existence\". A representative quote of Montaigne is: \"I have never seen a greater monster or miracle than myself.\"\nCiting the case of Martin Guerre as an example, Montaigne believes that humans cannot attain certainty. His philosophical skepticism is best expressed in the long essay \"An Apology for Raymond Sebond\" (Book 2, Chapter 12) in which he embraced the philosophy of Pyrrhonism. Montaigne posits that we cannot trust our reasoning because thoughts just occur to us: we do not truly control them. Further, he says we do not have good reasons to consider ourselves superior to the animals. He is highly skeptical of confessions obtained under torture, pointing out that such confessions can be made up by the suspect just to escape the torture to which he is subjected. In the middle of the section normally entitled \"Man's Knowledge Cannot Make Him Good\", he wrote that his motto was \"What do I know?\" The essay on Sebond defended Christianity. Montaigne also eloquently employed many references and quotes from classical Greek and Roman, i.e. non-Christian authors, especially the atomist Lucretius.\nMontaigne considered marriage necessary for the raising of children, but disliked the strong feelings of romantic love as being detrimental to freedom. One of his quotations is: \"Marriage is like a cage; one sees the birds outside desperate to get in, and those inside desperate to get out.\"\nIn education, he favored concrete examples and experience over the teaching of abstract knowledge that is expected to be accepted uncritically.

The two expansionist monarchies had come to blows, and the precedents for taxation of the clergy for a \"just war\" if it was declared a crusade and authorized by the papacy had been well established.

The hostilities with France also brought increased exactions on the English church to finance them. Benedict sent cardinal nuncios to each court in hope of a brokered truce, but their efforts were unsuccessful.\nAt a time when the laity were taxed an eleventh on their movable goods, or a seventh if they lived in town or on a royal demesne, the clergy, under Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Winchelsey, offered a tenth for national defense. King Edward I declined and suggested rather a quarter or a third.The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 reiterated a principle, found in the Lateran Council of 1179, that a secular power might not tax Church property without first obtaining permission from the pope. It had become accepted practice. Philip IV had himself observed it in 1288 in collecting a tenth over three years.

Loughlin, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1903), sees this as expressing two underlying principles: (1) That the clergy should enjoy equally with the laity the right of determining the need and the amount of their subsidies to the Crown; and (2) That the head of the Church ought to be consulted when there was question of diverting the revenues of the Church to secular purposes.The Bull was criticized for the vehemence of its tone, for its exaggerated indictment of the hostile attitude of the laity of all ages towards the clergy, and for its failure to make clear the distinction between the revenues of the purely ecclesiastical benefices and the \"lay fees\" held by the clergy on feudal tenure. Unscrupulous advisers of Philip were quick to take advantage of the Pope's hasty language and, by forcing him to make explanations, put him on the defensive and weakened his prestige.Clericis laicos was a reminder of the traditional principle. Surprised by the strong reaction of the French crown and pressure from the French bishops seeking a compromise, in July 1297 Boniface issued another bull, Etsi de statu, which allowed lay taxation of clergy without papal consent in cases of emergency.Nonetheless, Clericis laicos was included by Pope Boniface in his collection of canon law, the Liber sextus decretalium.

Roran rejoins the Varden at Dras-Leona, which proves difficult to take, as it is under protection by Murtagh and his dragon Thorn. Jeod finds information about a possible entrance to the city via an incomplete sewer system under it.\nEragon, Arya, Angela, the werecat Solembum, and an elf named Wyrden enter this sewer system, to sneak into the city and open the gates. However, the mission goes awry, as the tunnels are used by the priests of Helgrind, who separate the group, slay Wyrden, and capture Eragon and Arya. The priests worship the Ra'zac, and attempt to feed Eragon and Arya to Ra'zac hatchlings, although Angela and Solembum save them.

As nobody has knowledge of the Rock, he questions Solembum, discovering that he had given the advice on instinct. During the conversation, Solembum appears to be possessed, helping Eragon discover that the Rock is located on Vroengard Island, and protected by magic which causes everyone, barring himself and Saphira, to forget about it upon hearing of it.

There, Galbatorix easily subdues them, and reveals that he has learned the true name of the ancient language, referred to as the Word.

Immediately, Topshe thinks of Tinkori Babu and Feluda agrees with him.\nHowever, they are confused about what could have been Tinkori Babu's motive. They get to know the motive only next morning, when Rajen Babu receives a letter from Tinkori Babu. In the letter, Tinkori Babu says that he had done it to avenge a wrong that Rajen Babu had done to him when they had studied in school together. Rajen Babu's act had scarred him deeply, both physically and mentally. When he saw Rajen Babu's picture at his house, he recognised him and decided to avenge himself by causing him to be anxious and lose his peace of mind.\nThe story creates an atmosphere of suspense and fear at the very outset with the mention of the threatening letter, which promises to punish Rajen Babu for past misdeeds. The reader is left wondering about what could have been the misdeed, and how and what punishment Rajen Babu will receive. As all the characters are introduced, the culprit is introduced as the least suspicious character but he is also shown to be intelligent. He tries to lead suspicion away from him by directing it towards Mr Ghoshal and also by saying that he will tell the police to take care of Rajen Babu, before leaving. This makes the story interesting as he is capable of matching wits with Feluda. The reader's attention is drawn towards the different characters by revealing the motives each of them could have. The reader focuses on these clues and may miss out the obvious detail that it was easiest for the culprit because of his close proximity to Rajen Babu, since he was staying at Rajen Babu's house.He came to Rajen babu 's house and seen his childhood photograph and  wanted to avenge the wrong done to him by Rajen.\nph, and decided", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_28761", "text": "In this story, Feluda's age is 27, and Topshe's is exactly half of Feluda's i.e. 13 and a half.\nThis is the first of two stories of Feluda, that are set in Darjeeling.

The latter, having arrived at the camp of paladins at the beginning of the novel, wants to avenge his father's death, caused by the Argalif Isoarre; Agilulf instead fights for duty, convinced of his faith, with a value that is admired by all the paladins, but also with a remarkable sense of duty, of precision in controlling the progress of the duties of others and their duties, for which the fellow soldiers find it as capable as it is unpleasant. During the move that Charlemagne made with his paladins to clash with the enemies, they met Gurdul\u00f9, a vagabond who let himself be guided by instinct without thinking, and who will be assigned as a squire to Agilulf by order of Charlemagne.\nWhen the battle begins, Rambaldo tries in every way to clash with the murderer of his father, who finally dies because, deprived of his glasses by the boy himself, he is no longer able to defend himself (the Argalif Isoarre is very short-sighted, therefore without glasses he cannot see and direct the course of the battle). Later the young man falls into an ambush, but is saved by the intervention of another knight with a periwinkle armor that, after fighting, moves away without saying a word. Returning to the camp on foot (during the battle his horse died), Rambaldo accidentally discovers that the valiant knight is actually a very charming woman, Bradamante, whom he immediately falls in love with. But the young woman is not interested in him but in Agilulf, the non-existent knight.\nDuring a banquet, the young Torrismondo reveals unexpected facts about the Agilulf knight. In fact he affirms that Sophronia, daughter of the king of Scotland, the woman who Agilulf had saved from the abuse of two brigands fifteen years before, was already then mother of Torrismondo, and therefore was certainly not a virgin; consequently the assignment of the title of knight to Agilulf for having saved a virgin from violence is not valid. The revelation throws the knight into a panic, who, by honor, decides to go and find the girl to prove that she was still pure at the time. Agilulf leaves, followed by Bradamante infatuated with him, who in turn is pursued by Rambaldo, in love with her. On the same evening Torrismondo also left to find his father, or one of the knights of the \"Sacred Order of the Knights of the Grail\", and to be recognized as a son by this order (given that his mother had revealed that he had conceived it by one of the many knights with whom she had joined, but to consider the whole order father of the child). Torrismondo finds the knights of the Grail, but loses his last hopes when they reveal themselves as a mystical sect, estranged from reality and moreover devoid of ethical conscience and tolerance towards those who do not belong to their order (the first evening after their meeting with Torrismondo, the young man sees them with dismay as they raid a village).\nare described briefly, and which lead him to Scotland and then to Morocco, Agilulf finds the woman he was looking for, Sophronia, in the harem of an Arab nobleman, still unharmed, and brings her back to the battlefield of the Franks, to finally prove to the Emperor that the woman was a virgin when he had saved her, and indeed is still a virgin. Torrismondo, however, arrives near the cave where his alleged mother had hidden, and they both surrender to the passion of love, and that is enough to frustrate Agilulf's effort. Eventually it will be discovered that Torrismondo is not the son of Sofronia, but her brother. The two siblings then discover themselves to be half-siblings, and in the end it will be known that Torrismondo is the son of the Queen of Scotland and of the Holy Order, while Sophronia was born years before by the king of Scotland and a peasant woman, and therefore the two, not being relatives, are free to love each other. Agilulf, therefore, has every right to be a knight, but unfortunately, before he can know the truth, he has already taken his own life: before dissolving he bequeaths his white armor to Rambaldo.\nRight then a Moorish army makes landing, led by the Muslim nobleman from whose harem Sophronia was freed, a battle is joined between Christians and Saracens, during which Rambaldo dons Agilulf's armor...the pristine, shining coat of armor gets pierced, dented and splattered in blood during the fight (while it always remained spotless while the Nonexistent Knight \"inhabited\" it...and, after the battle is won by the christian side, Bradamante throws herself at Rambaldo, believing him to be Agilulf. The two consummate their love, with Bradamante so enraptured that she fails to recognize Rambaldo, save at the end. She gets enraged and flees the premises when she realizes that her 'beloved' Agilulf has ceased to exist for good.\nSome time later, Sofronia and Torrismondo, now married, and Gurdul\u00f9, who seems to be in possession of reasoning skills, settle in a village that the Templars had raided, and they are amazed that the inhabitants had the opportunity to hunt the Templars alone, without the help of any knight.\nTo tell the whole story is a nun, Sister Teodora, who only at the end reveals that she is nothing but Bradamante, still sought after by Rambaldo.

Rydell quits a temporary job as a security guard at the Lucky Dragon convenience store to run errands for atrophied computer hacker Colin Laney (the protagonist of Idoru), who lives in a cardboard box in a subway in Shinjuku, Tokyo. As a child, Laney was the subject of pharmaceutical trials which damaged his nervous system. As a result, he has a form of attention deficit disorder but gains the ability to discern nodal points in the undifferentiated flow of information, and from that he acquires a certain predictive faculty. This makes him ideal for the role of \"netrunner\" or data analyst. A side effect of 5-SB, the drug administered to Laney, causes the user to become attached to strong personalities. As a result, Laney has become obsessed with media baron Cody Harwood of Harwood/Levine, a powerful public relations firm. He spends his life surfing the net from his enclave in the subway, searching for traces of Harwood in the media. From this, Laney foresees a crucial historical shift which may precede the end of the world \"as we know it\". He predicts that Harwood, who had also taken 5-SB before (albeit voluntarily, with the knowledge of the consequences), knows this and will try to shape this historical shift to his liking. To stop Harwood, Laney hires Rydell under the guise of a courier to travel to San Francisco where he believes the next nodal point will congeal.\nThe second story concerns ex-bicycle messenger Chevette Washington, also from Virtual Light, who is on the run from her ex-boyfriend.

As the works of Latino authors were very popular at the time, Fuguet believed his chances of getting his works translated and published were quite high. However, upon reading Fuguet's work, the editor was convinced that the lack of magical realist or fantastical components in the narrative made it seem as if, \"the story could have taken place right there in [the United States of] America.\" Consequently, the story was rejected on the grounds that 'it was not Latin American enough'. In response to the rejection of American editors, a short story anthology was compiled dawning the title McOndo. Edited and introduced by Alberto Fuguet and Sergio G\u00f3mez, the anthology of new Latin American literature was first published in Spain in 1996. The work compiled 17 short stories written by authors, all of whom were from either Latin America or Spain. All of the contributors were males who had primarily commenced their literary careers in the 1990s and all were born after the late 1950s. The contributing authors distanced themselves from the magical realism genre as they believed it did not correctly represent modern Latin America, which in the 1990s was full of \"shopping malls, cable television, suburbs, and pollution\". Alternately, the authors wished to focus on the erasure of nations, borders and geographical identities as a result of expanding transnational networks while exploring the effects of globalization on economy and culture. In one essay, Fuguet railed against the picturesque, exotic stereotypes that the publishing world had come to expect of Latin writers, citing well-known Cuban author-exile Reinaldo Arenas's pronouncement that the literary world expected Latin American novelists to tackle only two themes: underdevelopment and exoticism. Fuguet wrote that he does not deny that there are picturesque, colourful, or quaint aspects to Latin America, but that the world he lives in is too complicated and urban to be bound by the rules of magical realism.

Despite her elderly secretary\u2019s doubts, the Society agrees with her proposal. Needing a mouse who can speak the Norwegian language to translate for them, the society decides to ask Miss Bianca for help. Miss Bianca is a white mouse who is pampered by the Ambassador's little boy, and the Ambassador is about to be transferred to Norway.\nBernard, a young mouse who lives in the embassy pantry and who has won a medal for \"bravery in the face of cats\", is volunteered by his friends and reluctantly agrees to talk to Miss Bianca. He uses the service lift in the pantry to enter the schoolroom of the Ambassador's house, and finds Miss Bianca in the magnificent porcelain pagoda the boy has given her. Bernard tries to convince her to find a brave Norwegian mouse for them, once she is in Norway. Though she is herself a poet and believes strongly in duty, Miss Bianca is at first terrified and refuses. However, as Bernard pleads with her, Miss Bianca begins to have feelings for Bernard, who makes no secret of the fact he is in love with her and would take her place if he could. When Miss Bianca travels to Oslo with the Ambassador's family, she decides to undertake the mission, later deciding to personally return with the Norwegian mouse so she can see Bernard again.\nUpon arrival in Oslo, Miss Bianca escapes the little boy's room and enters an underground wine cellar full of sailor mice at a bachelor party. The Petty Officer volunteers a sturdy, seasoned adventurer named Nils for the mission, and Nils instantly agrees. He takes Miss Bianca back to the Prisoner's Aid Society, the first half of the journey stowing away on a cargo ship and the rest of the way by speedboat (a toy of the Ambassador's son). Miss Bianca plans to bid Bernard one last fond goodbye and return to her home; however, when Bernard volunteers to help Nils at the Black Castle, Miss Bianca impulsively decides to do the same.\nThe three mice hitch a ride on a supply wagon, and travel two weeks across country to the prison, located in the nearly impenetrable ruins of an old castle. They find the castle's only mouse hole in the Head Jailer's office (the only chamber with wooden walls), and set up living quarters. However, expeditions by Bernard and Nils show the mission is nearly hopeless\u2014all the doors in the castle are heavy iron, there are very few places to hide, and they are constantly in danger of Mamelouk, the Head Jailer's gigantic black half-Persian cat.\nAt first, Miss Bianca serves as de Facto chairwoman, but soon begins to take a more active part in the mission when she encounters Mamelouk and discovers her charm and wit both infuriate and fascinate him. She begins to distract Mamelouk by baiting him into conversation and taunting him, both easy tasks as he is incredibly boastful and equally stupid. At one point, she discovers a paper attached by treacle to Mamelouk's fur; this turns out to be a lament written by the Norwegian poet, proving he is still alive. Another day, she is able to get Mamelouk to admit he and all the jailers will be practically comatose on New Year's Day, having eaten and drunk more than their fill at a New Year's Eve party the night before. Bernard and Nils, now able to explore more freely with Mamelouk distracted, discover that the river that runs below the castle, swollen by a sudden storm, has washed away rocks blocking up an old water gate. Mamelouk catches Nils and Bernard as they return to Miss Bianca with the news, but she tricks him into slackening his grip, and they escape.\nAfter packing up the living quarters, the mice set out on New Year's Day. They manage to steal the keys from a sleeping/drunk guard, who conveniently had unlocked the cell hall door before he collapsed. They travel past the cells, with Nils calling out in Norwegian, finally getting a response from a sick and emaciated young man with overgrown hair and nails. This is indeed the poet - being an artist and a dreamer, he is the only one in the prison who can believe the mice really are talking to him. He uses the key to leave his cell, follows them to the water gate, and escapes. The whole party nearly drowns in the freezing, swollen river, but they are rescued by a kindly family traveling on a large raft. Having no respect for the Black Castle, the family takes the poet and the mice downriver as far as they can, no questions asked.\nThe three mice are welcomed back to headquarters amidst a huge celebration, and several artifacts of their time in the Black Castle are framed in the meeting hall for posterity. All three mice receive new silver medals with a picture of a broken fetter etched upon them, as well. Healed and cleaned up by the barge people, the poet thanks the mice and returns to Norway, promising to meet up with Nils in Oslo. Miss Bianca gives Nils the speedboat, in which he sails home to Norway, and Bernard invites Miss Bianca to live with him. She nearly accepts, until the Ambassador's footman discovers her and picks her up, commenting on how much the Ambassador's little boy has grieved for her. Deciding her duty is to comfort the boy, she bids Bernard farewell, and returns to her beloved master, much to the joy of the household.

Arkady brings his friend, Eugene Bazarov. His father, Nikolay, gladly receives the two young men at his estate, but Nikolay's brother, Pavel, soon becomes upset by the strange new philosophy called \"nihilism\" that the young men advocate.\nNikolay, initially delighted to have his son return home, slowly begins to feel uneasy. A certain awkwardness develops in his regard toward his son, as Arkady's radical views, much influenced by Bazarov, make Nikolay's own beliefs feel dated. Nikolay has always tried to stay as current as possible, by doing things such as visiting his son at school so the two can stay as close as they can, but this in Nikolay's eyes has failed. To complicate this, the father has taken a servant, Fenechka, into his house to live with him and has already had a son by her, named Mitya. Arkady, however, is not troubled by the relationship; on the contrary, he is delighted by the addition of a younger brother.\nThe two young men stay at Marino for some weeks, then decide to visit a relative of Arkady's. There, they observe the local gentry and meet Madame Anna Sergevna Odintsova, an elegant woman of independent means, who cuts a seductively different figure from conventional types of the local provincial society. Both are greatly attracted to her, and she, intrigued by Bazarov's singular manner, invites them to spend a few days at her estate, Nikolskoye.\nAt Nikolskoye, they also meet Katya, Madame Odintsova's sister. Although they stay for just a short time, Arkady steadily becomes more independent of Bazarov's influence. Bazarov finds falling in love distressing because it runs counter to his nihilist beliefs. Eventually, prompted by Madame Odintsova's own cautious expressions of attraction to him, he announces that he loves her. She does not respond positively to his declaration; she finds his devaluation of feelings and of the aesthetic side of existence unattractive. She does not see the possibility of a good future with him. After his avowal of love, and her failure to make a similar declaration, Bazarov proceeds to his parents' home, and Arkady goes with him.\nAt Bazarov's home, they are received enthusiastically by his parents, who adore him. Bazarov's social cynicism is still on display as he settles back into his own family's home again. Arkady, who has delighted Bazarov's father by assuring him that his son has a brilliant future in store, reproves his friend for his brusqueness. Later, Bazarov and Arkady nearly come to blows after Bazarov speaks insultingly of Arkady's uncle and chides Arkady for expressing himself too romantically. Arkady becomes more openly skeptical of Bazarov's ideals. After a brief stay, much to the parents' disappointment, they decide to return to Marino, stopping on the way to see Madame Odintsova, who receives them coolly. Embarrassed, they leave almost immediately and return to Arkady's home.\nArkady remains for only a few days and makes an excuse to leave in order to go to Nikolskoye again. Once there, he realizes he is not in love with Odintsova, but instead with her sister Katya. Bazarov stays at Marino to do some scientific research, and tension between him and Pavel increases. Bazarov enjoys talking with Fenechka and playing with her child, and one day he kisses her, against her will. Pavel observes this kiss and challenges Bazarov to a duel. Pavel is wounded in the leg, and Bazarov must leave Marino, going to his parents' home. Meanwhile, Arkady and Katya have fallen in love and have become engaged.\nWhile back at home, Bazarov begins to help his father as a country doctor. He cannot keep his mind on his work, though, and while performing an autopsy, he cuts himself and becomes infected. On his deathbed, he sends for Madame Odintsova, who arrives just in time to hear Bazarov tell her how beautiful she is.

Desi, who is increasingly unhappy with her marriage, tells Twilly that he is \"aiming low\" if he is trying to correct Stoat's misbehavior. She guides him to Toad Island, where Clapley's construction crew has deliberately buried thousands of oak toads to avoid later protest by environmentalists.

Alicia is described as being physically perfect but emotionally and intellectually empty. She will say whatever she believes others want to hear. Far from having any ambition or goals of her own, she lives her life based on what she believes is expected of her. Ewald describes his frustration with the disparity between her appearance and her self and confides that though he can have no other, she is so hopeless that he has resolved to kill himself.\nEdison replies by offering to construct for Ewald a machine-woman in the form of Alicia but without any of her bothersome personality. He shows Ewald the prototype of the Android, named Hadaly, and Ewald is intrigued and accepts Edison's offer. Edison reveals that he has invited Alicia to his residence at Menlo Park in order to set the process in motion. He then explains to the still somewhat doubtful Ewald how he will interact with the Android and how natural it will all feel. \nEwald then presses Edison to tell him why he created Hadaly in the first place. Edison relates a long story about Mr. Edward Anderson who was tempted into infidelity by a young woman named Miss Evelyn. His indiscretion, brought about by the guile of Miss Evelyn, ruins his life completely.  Edison then says that he tracked down Miss Evelyn only to discover that she was not as she appeared, rather she was horribly ugly and her beauty was entirely the work of cosmetics, wigs, and other accessories. Edison created Hadaly in an effort to overcome the flaws and artificiality of real women and create a perfect and natural woman who could bring a man true happiness. Edison then takes Ewald back to Hadaly and explains to him the exact mechanical details of her functioning: how she moves and talks and breathes and bathes, all the while explaining how natural and normal Hadaly's robotic needs are, comparing them to similar human actions and functions.\nAfter the details of the android's functioning and construction are covered, Alicia arrives and is escorted in. Edison convinces her that she is being considered for an important theater role. Over the course of the next weeks, she poses for Edison and her exact physical likeness is duplicated and recordings of her voice are made.

One consequence was the rise of a new approach to marginalized communities, who were no longer perceived as \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d regions but rather as areas that were striving to overcome the negative impact colonization and imperialism had in the subcontinent.\nThis argument, later known as the Dependency theory, was presented by several authors but it was Galeano who shared the idea with the entire region.Mexican author Elena Poniatowska, winner of the 2013 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, said in an interview with BBC that what Galeano did in Open Veins had never been done before. \"He gathered thousands of the most forgotten voices of Latin America,\" Poniatowska stated.\nSimilarly, Jorge Volpi, another Mexican author, argued that Open Veins is one of the most influential texts written in Latin America during the twentieth-century and that \"it opened the eyes of many young writers and political activists regarding the exploitation of this [Latin America] part of the world.\"Open Veins also was and continues to be part of the battle of ideas that initiated during the Cold War, by becoming a symbol of opposition to the intervention of the United States and other foreign powers in Latin American affairs.\nIn the foreword to the 1997 edition, Isabel Allende stated that \"after the military coup of 1973 I could not take much with me: some clothes, family pictures, a small bag of dirt from my garden, and two books: an old edition of the Odes by Pablo Neruda and the book with the yellow cover, Las venas abiertas de Am\u00e9rica Latina\". Allende claims that the 1973 Military Coup against her uncle and leftist Chilean president Salvador Allende that gave rise to the long dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet could have been predicted based on Open Veins.

In lifestyle he ranges from near adoption by a wealthy couple who spoil him, to a struggle for existence stealing books and helping out friends in desperate straits. His most unusual adventure is his flight to Mexico with the wild and irrepressible Thea who tries to catch lizards with an eagle. Thea attempts to convince Augie to join her in this seemingly impossible task.\nHis jobs include general assistance to the slightly corrupt Einhorn, helping in a dog training parlor, working for his brother at a coal-tip, and working for the Congress of Industrial Organizations until finally he joins the merchant navy in the war.\nAugie attracts and gets involved with a string of different women. Firstly a casual acquaintance as a youth, he gets engaged to a wealthy cousin of his brother's wife. However, through a scandal not of his fault, he is discarded. After a casual affair with Sophie, a Greek hotel maid, he is swept off by Thea, whom he had met when living with the rich Renlings and who forecast their relationship even though he loved her sister. After the fiasco in Mexico, where he suffered a terrible accident on a horse, he and Thea began drifting apart; he spending his time playing cards and she hunting for snakes and lizards in the mountains. Their inevitable split came the night he agreed to drive another woman, Stella, to another town to escape her troubled boyfriend. After the break-up, Augie returned to Chicago and picked back up with Sophie until joining the merchant navy and heading to New York. There he met up with Stella again and married her.\nAll through the book, Augie is encouraged into education, but never quite seems to make it; he reads a great deal for himself and develops a philosophy of life. Something or somebody always tends to crop up, turning his path before Augie seriously considers returning to education.\nDuring the war, his ship is sunk and he suffers a difficult episode in a lifeboat with a man who turns out to be a lunatic. After rescue, he returns to Stella and the book ends with them living a slightly dubious existence in France, he involved in some fairly shady business deals and she attempting to pursue a career in acting.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_29027", "text": "The Adventures of Augie March can be seen as a dispelling of the traditional idea of an American hero.

However, despite these advantages, Augie does not truly live out the life of a hero. He has no commitments of his own, and merely goes along with plans and schemes developed by others. He never truly decides what he wants to do with himself, and \"manages a deep enthusiasm just twice in the novel: he falls in love twice...The first experience fails completely; and the second, as the novels ends, is failing.\" Everyone around Augie finds a greater measure of success than he because they commit themselves to some pursuit or goal, even if it is not the most noble. Ultimately, though Augie has every chance to succeed in the world, he never does so because he refuses to engage in that world, and instead keeps chasing the vague \"better fate\" he has convinced himself he deserves.

For him all arguments concerning the age of the Tanna debe Eliyahu and against its identification with the \"Seder Eliyahu\" mentioned in Ket. 10b, are only superficial and only apparently sound; and he accordingly assigns the origin of the work \"eo ipso\" to Babylonia.The age of the midrash can be estimated from three data contained in the book itself.\n\nChapter 2 speaks of the 7th century of the 2,000 years of the Messianic period as having passed; this period began in 242 CE, hence the time of writing must have been the 10th century.\nThe second datum relates to the temporal reckoning of the jubilees, and is treated by J.L.
