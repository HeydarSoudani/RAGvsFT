The first American battleships designed after the Washington treaty system began to break down in the mid-1930s, they took advantage of an escalator clause that allowed increasing the main battery to 16-inch (406 mm) guns, but refusal to authorize larger battleships kept their displacement close to the Washington limit of 35,000 long tons (35,562 t). A requirement to be armored against the same caliber of guns as they carried, combined with the displacement restriction, resulted in cramped ships, a problem that was exacerbated as wartime modifications that considerably strengthened their anti-aircraft batteries significantly increased their crews.\nIndiana entered service in April 1942, by which time the United States was engaged in World War II, and the ship was immediately pressed into action in the Pacific War against Japan. Her first combat came in late 1942 when she supported marines fighting during the Guadalcanal campaign. Over the next three years, she was occupied with two primary roles: naval gunfire support for amphibious assaults across the Pacific and anti-aircraft defense for the fast carrier task force. She shelled Japanese positions during the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943 and the Battle of Kwajalein in February 1944. During the latter operation, she collided with the battleship Washington and was forced to withdraw for repairs.\nAfter returning to the fleet in April 1944, she took part in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, bombarding Saipan and helping to defend the fleet during the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Engine problems prevented her from participating in the Battle of Peleliu in September, but she was present for the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945. In the latter action, she shot down a number of kamikazes. Following the Japanese surrender in August, she contributed men to the occupation force before returning to the United States in September.

Popular cameras of this type at that time were mainly from Europe but a few from Japan, including the Asahi Pentax, the Miranda T and the Topcon R. The miniature SLR camera concept was conceived in the 1930s at Ihagee in Dresden, resulting in the 1936 Kine Exakta. Influential cameras designs like that of the 1939 KW Praktiflex, the 1949 ZI Contax S, and 1952 the KW Praktina marked the steady progress toward a perfected SLR. Several features of the latter seem to have influenced the design of the SR-2 although dissimilar in many respects. The obvious similarities are the stepped top plate, the carrying strap lugs, the self-timer lever and some general body features.The name Minolta was first used in 1932 on the 4.5\u00d76 format Semi-Minolta using 120 film. The manufacturer was established in November 1928 by Kazuo Tashima (1899-1985) as the Nichidoku Shashinki Sh\u014dten (Japan-German Camera Store) together with two Germans living in Japan, but reorganised as a joint stock company named the Molta Goshi Kaisha in the summer of 1931. It is likely that this inspired the name Minolta that later became a registered trade mark. However, in 1937 the company was reorganised as the Chiyoda Kogaku Seik\u014d KK, CHIYOKO for short. Chiyoda Kogaku manufactured leaf shutters and photographic lenses, as well as melting their own optical glasses, an achievement very few camera makers ever have matched.

It was not intended to reconnoitre and report as its name suggests but was a light armoured combat vehicle, mostly without a radio and used as a support tank for the mechanised infantry.\nThe AMR 35 originated from a project in 1933 to improve the earlier AMR 33 by moving the engine from the front to the back. In 1934 a stronger suspension was fitted and the type was chosen to replace the AMR 33 on the production lines that year. Three orders were made by the French Cavalry of in total two hundred vehicles in five versions, including two machine-gun tanks, two tank destroyer types and a command tank. Later ten were ordered of a radio communication variant, the Renault YS, and over forty were built of a tropical version, the ZT 4.\nThe production would be much delayed by financial and technical problems, deliveries only starting in 1936. The AMR 35 proved to be an unreliable vehicle. It was one of the fastest tanks of its day, but its very speed overstressed its mechanical parts.

In what would give the model line its name, the exterior was given European \"continental\" styling elements, including a rear-mounted spare tire.\nIn production for over 55 years across nine different decades, Lincoln has produced ten generations of the Continental. Within the Lincoln model line, the Continental has served several roles ranging from its flagship to its base-trim sedan. From 1961 to 1976, Lincoln sold the Continental as its exclusive model line.  The model line has also gone on hiatus three times. From 1949 to 1955, the nameplate was briefly retired. In 1981, the Continental was renamed the Lincoln Town Car to accommodate the 1982 seventh-generation Continental.  After 2002, the Continental was retired, largely replaced by the Lincoln MKS in 2009; in 2017, the tenth-generation Continental replaced the MKS.\nAs part of its entry into full-scale production, the first-generation Continental was the progenitor of an entirely new automotive segment, the personal luxury car. Following World War II, the segment evolved into coupes and convertibles larger than sports cars and grand touring cars with an emphasis on features, styling, and comfort over performance and handling. From 1956 to 1957, the Continental nameplate was the namesake of the short-lived Continental Division, marketing the 1956\u20131957 Continental Mark II as the worldwide flagship of Ford Motor Company; as a second successor, Ford introduced the Continental Mark series in 1969, produced over six generations to 1998.\nAlong with the creation of the personal luxury car segment, the Lincoln Continental marked the zenith of several designs in American automotive history.

It is the largest and heaviest Mach 2+ supersonic military aircraft ever built and second to the experimental XB-70 Valkyrie in overall length and top speed. As of 2024, it is the largest and heaviest combat aircraft, the fastest bomber in use and the largest and heaviest variable-sweep wing airplane ever flown. The Tu-160 is operated by the Long Range Aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces.Entering service in 1987, the Tu-160 was the last strategic bomber designed for the Soviet Air Forces and was built to serve as a conventional and nuclear-capable strike aircraft. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the newly independent Ukraine inherited a fleet of 19 Tu-160s, over half of all the Tu-160s in existence at that time. They had been deployed there since the late 1980s with local Soviet Air Force units and were soon afterwards handed over to the newly formed Ukrainian Air Force. Following protracted negotiations, 11 Ukrainian Tu-160s were purchased by the Russian Federation while the remainder were scrapped in the late 1990s under the Nunn\u2013Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction agreement.  Following these actions, the sole operator of the type is the Russian Aerospace Forces' Long Range Aviation branch, which has 16 Tu-160s in service as of 2016. The type had its combat debut in November 2015 during the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, conducting numerous airstrikes using Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles. Various overseas deployments have been conducted, including to distant nations such as Venezuela and South Africa.\nSince the early 2000s, the active fleet has been subject to several upgrades, largely focusing on various electronics systems. The Tu-160M modernization program of existing models began with the first updated aircraft delivered in December 2014. Plans announced in 2015 called for the delivery of 50 new-build Tu-160Ms as well as the upgrading of 16 existing aircraft. In January 2022, the first serial-built Tu-160M performed a test flight, with two planned for delivery in 2022 from 10 on order.", "hasanswer": true}]}

A pair of these provided 85% of the Space Shuttle's thrust at liftoff and for the first two minutes of ascent. After burnout, they were jettisoned and parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean where they were recovered, examined, refurbished, and reused.\nThe Space Shuttle SRBs were the most powerful solid rocket motors to ever launch humans. The Space Launch System (SLS) SRBs, adapted from the shuttle, surpassed it as the most powerful solid rocket motors ever flown, after the launch of the Artemis 1 mission in 2022. Each Space Shuttle SRB provided a maximum 14.7 MN (3,300,000 lbf) thrust, roughly double the most powerful single-combustion chamber liquid-propellant rocket engine ever flown, the Rocketdyne F-1. With a combined mass of about 1,180 t (1,160 long tons; 1,300 short tons), they comprised over half the mass of the Shuttle stack at liftoff. The motor segments of the SRBs were manufactured by Thiokol of Brigham City, Utah, which was later purchased by ATK.

The GSV-R replaced Suzuki's 500 cc two-stroke V4 RGV500 which was ridden by Kenny Roberts Jr. to win the 500cc World Championship in 2000.\nThe GSV-R was introduced on 2002, one year earlier than the original plan, with codename XRE0. New regulations were promoting the growth of four-stroke engines, and the performance of the new engine during testing was strong according to Suzuki. Despite the use of a new engine, XRE0 was using the old RGV500 Gamma Chassis, which was later criticized as a big mistake by many MotoGP analysts. Using the chassis and fairings that were previously made for the two-stroke RGV500 engine, XRE0 was hampered by many stability issues. The use of RGV500 Tyre spec was another mistake. Despite all of that, XRE0 was able to taste its first podium (2nd place) on the opening round at Suzuka and got third place at Rio in the same year. XRE0 achievements however were inconsistent, as the riders often fell down, crashed, or were forced to retire by technical failures. The top XRE0 rider by the end of The 2002 MotoGP Championship was Kenny Roberts Jr. in ninth place overall.\nFor 2007, MotoGP rules were changed to allow a maximum displacement of 800 cc. Suzuki introduced an 800 cc version of the GSV-R also known as GSV-R800.  The GSV-R800 was codenamed XRG0 because of its newly redesigned engine based on displacement limitations.  The new XRG0 engine was based from the layout of the 2006 990 cc GSV-R however, the XRG0 engines bore, stroke, and cylinder pitch had been redesigned to better suit the 800 cc engine displacement.  The factory Rizla Suzuki MotoGP team stated the new engines aim was to \u2018achieve the best possible horsepower and reliable high rpm operation, and to provide the riders with user friendly power delivery and predictable engine character.\u2019   The XRG0 was also equipped with a redesigned engine control unit supplied by Mitsubishi, capable of producing 220 horsepower at 17,500 rpm.  The chassis layout and wheelbase length from the 2006 GSV-R XRE4 used in the 2006 MotoGP season remained on the new model, however the fairing design had been updated to better accommodate high speed stability.The 2008 MotoGP season brought another redesigned GSV-R800 that Suzuki codenamed XRG1 as the successor to the XRG0 of the previous year.  This second generation 800 cc four-stroke prototype was the most complex and technically advanced racing motorcycle Suzuki had ever produced at its time.  The XRG1 had been developed closely with team riders Chris Vermeulen and Loris Capirossi and the feedback from the MotoGP team and Suzuki test engineers.  A key focus area in refining the XRG1 was improving acceleration.  This was accomplished by refining every detail of the 2007 XRG0 engine and an updated Mitsubishi ECU.  The resulted engine redesigning provided lower fuel consumption and increased usability.  Further refinements of the XRG0 chassis for the 2008 XRG1 allowed for better cornering performance and change of direction.  Along with the chassis refinements, a newly designed fairing  was developed to reduce wind resistance to enhance handling characteristics.At the end of 2011 Suzuki pulled out of MotoGP until at least 2014, citing the need to reduce costs amid the global economic downturn.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was designed to be compatible for all data formats. However the word size and instruction set were completely different; this presented significant difficulty as all programs had to be rewritten, so many customers switched to different vendors instead of upgrading existing UNIVACs.\nThe UNIVAC III weighed about 27,225 pounds (13.6 short tons; 12.3 t).The system was engineered to use as little core memory as possible, as it was a very expensive item. The memory system was 25 bits wide and could be configured with from 8,192 words to 32,768 words of memory. Memory was built in stacks of 29 planes of 4,096 cores: 25 for the data word, two for \"modulo-3 check\" bits, and two for spares. Each memory cabinet held up to four stacks (16,384 words).\nIt supported the following data formats:\n\n25-bit signed binary numbers\nexcess-3 binary-coded decimal with four bits per digit, allowing six-digit signed decimal numbers\nalphanumerics with six bits per character, allowing four-character signed alphanumeric valuesInstructions were 25 bits long.\n\nThe CPU had four accumulators, a four-bit field (ar) allowed selection of any combination of the accumulators for operations on data from one to four words in length. For backward compatibility with the UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II data, two accumulators were needed to store a 12-digit decimal number and three accumulators were needed to store a 12-character alphanumeric value. When accumulators were combined in an instruction, the sign bit of the Most Significant Accumulator was used and the others ignored.\nThe CPU had 15 index registers, a four-bit field (x) allowed selection of one index register as the base register. Operand addresses were determined by adding the contents of the selected base register and the 10-bit displacement field (m). Instructions that modified or stored index registers used a four-bit field (xo) to select that index register.\nIndirect addressing or field selection was selected if the one-bit field (i/a) was set. Both indirect addressing and a base register could be selected in the indirect address in memory. Only a base register could be selected in the field selector in memory.\n\nSperry Rand began shipment in June 1962 and produced 96 UNIVAC III systems.\nThe operating systems(s) which were developed for the UNIVAC III's were called CHIEF, and BOSS.The assembly language was SALT. The majority of UNIVAC III systems were equipped with tape drives; tapes contained images of the system data at the head of any tape, followed by data.  The OS could handle jobs at this time, so some tapes had data relating to job control, and others had data.  UNIVAC III systems could have up to 32 tape drives.\nSome systems were equipped at a later time with a random-access FASTRAND drum.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The VC10 is often compared to the larger Soviet Ilyushin Il-62, the two types being the only airliners to use a rear-engined quad layout, while the smaller business jet Lockheed JetStar also has this engine arrangement. \nThe VC10 was designed to operate on long-distance routes from the shorter runways of the era and commanded excellent hot and high performance for operations from African airports. The performance of the VC10 was such that it achieved the fastest crossing of the Atlantic by a subsonic jet airliner of 5 hours and 1 minute, a record that was held for 41 years, until February 2020 when a British Airways Boeing 747 broke the record at 4 hours 56 minutes due to Storm Ciara. Only the supersonic Concorde was faster. Although only a relatively small number of VC10s were built, they provided long service with BOAC and other airlines from the 1960s to 1981.\nThe VC10 was also used from 1965 as strategic air transports for the Royal Air Force, and ex-passenger models and others were used as aerial refuelling aircraft.

The L-1 Class was also called the \"Angus\" Type in homage to Angus Sinclair, who was the publisher of Railway & Locomotive Engineering, a leading trade journal. A rarely seen photograph of #2602 shows his name under the windows on the cab sides. \nThe use of an intercepting valve allowed the locomotive to be used in simple or single expansion steam capacity. This meant that if desired, high pressure steam could be supplied to the front and rear cylinder groups for additional power at the cost of exhausting the boiler of steam pressure quicker. \nThese locomotives were built for \"pusher\" service, especially on the heavy grades of the Erie Railroads' Susquehanna Division over Gulf Summit on the Pennsylvania and New York State border; and these locomotives primarily operated between Port Jervis, NY, and Susquehanna, PA.\nPusher service is defined where additional locomotives are/were added to the rear of a train of which has its normal complement of locomotives on the lead end. The pusher locomotives then assist by helping push the train up the grade. Also, they helped control the stresses on the couplers and draft gear, and by which lowered the amount of broken coupler knuckles on a heavy train.

It was the company's first independent design, and also Japan's first passenger car with a diesel engine. It was available as a four-door sedan and a five-door station wagon, called the Bellel Express. The Bellel Express was technically speaking a commercial vehicle, as was the custom in Japan at the time. The name \"Bellel\" resulted from combining the English word \"bell\" with the Roman numeral \"L\", equalling 50, and thus the name was supposed to represent \"fifty Bells\" (Isuzu literally means \"fifty bells\" in Japanese), and reflects a tradition within Isuzu of naming products that use terms that have special significance in Japan. Production began in time for the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo in October 1964, with initial release in select Japanese cities starting in April 1962.\n\nThe Bellel was fitted with 1.5 L and 2.0 L gasoline OHV engines with a Bosch licensed fuel injection system, and also the aforementioned 55 PS (40 kW) 2.0 L diesel (DL201) engine. The original diesel engine was called the DL200; it offered 52 PS (38 kW). All engines were mated with a four-speed manual transmission with the shifter mounted on the steering column. The suspension setup was modeled after the Hillman Minx, which was previously manufactured by Isuzu under a license agreement with the Rootes Group. The list of standard equipment expanded so that it could compete for sales against more popular products from more prolific Japanese  manufacturers, helping to justify the yearly road tax bill for using a large displacement engine, while remaining compliant with Japanese Government dimension regulations. As the private car ownership market in Japan began to grow, the Bellel was offered as an alternative to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric, and the Prince Gloria.\nThe original end treatment was updated in October 1965 in an attempt to afford the Bellel a more formal, upscale and mainstream look. The facelift included changes to the front fascia, where the previous single round headlights paired with smaller turn signals were replaced by quad round headlights arranged vertically.\n\nThe diesel engine - a first for a Japanese passenger car - made the Bellel popular for commercial applications, such as taxicab services. This partially helped to offset the Bellel's relative unpopularity with private customers, which resulted from the harshness of the early diesel engine and peculiar styling. A small number of these cars found their way into other countries, with the Bellel also offered with left-hand drive. 37,206 Bellels were manufactured in total (including the Express wagon/van), with production coming to an end in May 1967.

The system was designed to offer backward compatibility with the PDP-11 while extending the memory to a full 32-bit implementation and adding demand paged virtual memory. The name VAX refers to its Virtual Address eXtension concept that allowed programs to make use of this newly available memory while still being compatible with unmodified user mode PDP-11 code. The name \"VAX-11\", used on early models, was chosen to highlight this capability. The VAX ISA is considered a complex instruction set computer (CISC) design.\nDEC quickly dropped the \u221211 branding as PDP-11 compatibility was no longer a major concern. The line expanded to both high-end mainframes like the VAX 9000 as well as to the workstation-scale systems like the VAXstation series. The VAX family ultimately contained ten distinct designs and over 100 individual models in total. All of them were compatible with each other and normally ran the VAX/VMS operating system.\nVAX has been perceived as the quintessential CISC ISA, with its very large number of assembly language programmer-friendly addressing modes and machine instructions, highly orthogonal instruction set architecture, and instructions for complex operations such as queue insertion or deletion, number formatting, and polynomial evaluation.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The name \"United States\" was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed. Joshua Humphreys designed the frigates to be the young Navy's capital ships, and so United States and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period.

At a time when the luxury car market had been driven into freefall by a combination of government taxation policy and the depressed state of the postwar economy, the VLR was critical in keeping alive the company that produced it during the early 1950s.\n\u201cVLR\u201d stood for \u00ab V\u00e9hicule l\u00e9ger de reconnaissance \u00bb (light reconnaissance vehicle).   The name \u00ab VLRD \u00bb V\u00e9hicule l\u00e9ger de reconnaissance Delahaye\u00bb is also sometimes used.\nThe vehicle featured a light metal ohc four-cylinder water-cooled engine of (initially) 1,995 cc and, by the standards of the time, a sophisticated suspension system.   The four-speed gear box featured synchromesh on all four speeds.During the second half of 1950 the French army tested it extensively and declared themselves impressed.   With only very minor modifications, they homologated the VLR for army use and placed an order for slightly more than 4,000.   The company's postwar production model, the Delahaye 175 had fared disastrously in the marketplace, with just 521 produced between 1947 and 1950, so the military order secured for the VLR was more than welcome.\nThe army were impressed by the performance of the vehicle both on and off-road, and the company was encouraged to try to sell VLRs into the civilian market.   Civilian-market models were hard to distinguish from the military ones, but the 24-volt electrical system upon which  the military had insisted was replaced, in the civilian VLRs, by a more conventional (for the time and vehicle's size) 12-volt electrical system.   The VLR's civil-market price of above one and a half million francs was considered expensive (though much lower than the prices asked for the company's luxury passenger cars), and its mechanical complexity made it an unattractive proposition other than for rich owner-mechanics.   It is worth bearing in mind that in the aftermath of a massive European war there were at this time a large number of second-hand Jeeps competing for the attention of anyone thinking to buy a civilian version of a VRC.

The basic concept was to allow US strategic bombers to launch their weapons from well outside the range of Soviet defenses, as much as 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from their targets. To do this in an air-launched form, a lightweight thermonuclear warhead was needed. Initially, the W47 from the Polaris missile was selected, but it was later replaced by the W59 from the Minuteman missile.\nThe UK joined the Skybolt program in 1960, intending to use it on their V bomber force. When the design added a star tracker in addition to its inertial navigation system (INS) this meant that it could only be carried externally where the tracker could see the sky. This requirement along with the required ground clearance on takeoff limited it to the Avro Vulcan bomber. Several design decisions in the W47 led the RAF to question its safety, so they intended to use their own Red Snow warheads. This was a heavier warhead and would reduce the range to about 600 miles (970 km), meaning the bombers would have to cross the Soviet coastline to attack Moscow.\nTesting began in 1962 and was initially marked by a string of failures. These failures, along with a lack of mission after the successful development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), led to its cancellation in December 1962. The UK had decided to base its entire 1960s deterrent force on Skybolt, and its cancellation led to a major disagreement between the UK and US, known today as the \"Skybolt Crisis\". This was resolved by a series of meetings that led to the Royal Navy gaining the UGM-27 Polaris missile and construction of the Resolution-class submarines to launch them.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It is based on a Nikon F80 (N80 in the U.S.) film camera body that was modified by Fujifilm to include its own proprietary image sensor and electronics. Because of the Nikon body, it has a Nikon AF lens mount and so can use most lenses made for Nikon 35 mm cameras. It is autofocusing, with an electronically controlled focal plane shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/4000 sec., built-in exposure metering and pop-up flash. Its ISO film speed equivalents range from 100 - 1600.  The S2 Pro also has sound recording capability. The camera is no longer in production, having been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro in February 2004.\nAside from the Nikon lens mount, the camera's principal distinction is its 6.17 megapixel photo sensor. Known as the Super CCD, it is unique in having its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other DSLR cameras. This allows the use of a sophisticated interpolation system that produces an output image equivalent to 12.1 megapixels. The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lies somewhere between 6.17 megapixels and the 12.1 megapixel interpolated output.\nA huge number of these cameras were built using a Sony sourced defective CCD that was subject to a recall by Fuji. The recall ended when the stock of these replacement CCD's was depleted. There is word that no other stockpiles exist of this Super HAD CCD, making these cameras that are found with the purple or black tinted image problems extinct, only usable for parts. The Fuji F700 used a similar defective HAD CCD, but in 3.1/6.2Mp size. That camera has met a similar fate.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

The Master System launched in North America in 1986, followed by Europe in 1987, and then in Brazil and Korea in 1989. A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987, which features a few enhancements over the export models (and by proxy the original Mark III): a built-in FM audio chip, a rapid-fire switch, and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses. The Master System II, a cheaper model, was released in 1990 in North America, Australasia and Europe.\nThe original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards.

The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot, turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system, and is incompatible with the 3D glasses.\nThe Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Its library is smaller and with fewer well-reviewed games than the NES, due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity.

It was developed to provide upscale transportation, competing with the Prince Skyline and Gloria which were later merged into the Nissan family. In later years, the Nissan Skyline was positioned as a sports sedan/coupe, whereas the Nissan Gloria was turned into a sporty version of the Cedric (with identical styling but using a different radiator grille and front & rear light clusters).\nIn Japan, the Cedric/Gloria series was affectionately called CedGlo, and this long-running series finally came to an end in October 2004, replaced by the Nissan Fuga. The Cedric name is still in use, on the Y31 series fleet vehicle traditionally used as a taxi, where it competes with the Toyota Comfort, and is still in production.

On 31 March 1998, the XP5 prototype with a modified rev limiter set the Guinness World Record for the world's fastest production car, reaching 240.1 mph (386.4 km/h), surpassing the modified Jaguar XJ220's 217.1 mph (349 km/h) record from 1993.\nThe car features numerous proprietary designs and technologies; it is lighter and has a more streamlined structure than many modern sports cars, despite having one seat more than most similar sports cars, with the driver's seat located in the centre (and slightly forward) of two passengers' seating positions, providing driver visibility superior to that of a conventional seating layout. It was conceived as an exercise in creating what its designers hoped would be considered the ultimate road car. Despite not having been designed as a track machine, a modified race car edition of the vehicle won several races, including the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, where it faced purpose-built prototype race cars. Production began in 1992 and ended in 1998. In all, 106 cars were manufactured, with some variations in the design.In 1994, the British car magazine Autocar stated in a road test regarding the F1, \"The McLaren F1 is the finest driving machine yet built for the public road.\" They further stated, \"The F1 will be remembered as one of the great events in the history of the car, and it may possibly be the fastest production road car the world will ever see.\" In 2005, Channel4 placed the car at number one on their list of the 100 greatest cars, calling it \"the greatest automotive achievement of all time\".

Designed to carry between 66 and 124 passengers, it was larger than any prior aircraft built by the company. The project's existence was revealed in early 1997 and was formally introduced at the Paris Air Show two years later. On 19 February 2002, the first prototype E-Jet conducted its maiden flight; later that year, quantity production of the type commenced. In early March 2004, the first E170 deliveries were made to LOT Polish Airlines. Larger versions of the aircraft, the E190 and E195, debuted later in 2004, while a slightly stretched version of the E170 was introduced in mid-2005 as the E175.\nThe E-Jet series has been a commercial success primarily due to its ability to efficiently serve lower-demand routes while offering many of the same amenities and features of larger jets. Initial teething issues were quickly overcome and Embraer rapidly expanded product support for better global coverage. The E-Jet family is commonly used by both mainline and regional airlines around the world and has become particularly popular with regional airlines in the United States. It has also served as the basis for the Embraer Lineage 1000 business jet. During the 2010s, Embraer developed a second generation, the E-Jet E2 family, with more fuel-efficient engines.

As the first home computer architecture with coprocessors, it has graphics and sound more advanced than most of its contemporaries. Video games are a key part of the system's software library, and the 1980 first-person space combat simulator Star Raiders is considered the platform's killer app. The \"Atari 8-bit family\" label was not contemporaneous. Atari, Inc., used the term \"Atari 800 [or 400] home computer system\", often combining the model names into \"Atari 400/800\" or \"Atari home computers\".The Atari 800 was packaged as a high-end model, and the 400 was more affordable. The 400 has a pressure-sensitive, spillproof membrane keyboard and initially shipped with 8 KB of RAM. The 800 has a conventional keyboard and a second cartridge slot, and allows easy RAM upgrades to 48K. Both use identical technology: the MOS Technology 6502 CPU at 1.79 MHz (1.77 MHz for PAL versions) and the same custom coprocessor chips. The plug-and-play peripherals use the Atari SIO serial bus, and one of the SIO developers eventually went on to co-patent USB (Universal Serial Bus). The core architecture of the Atari 8-bit family was reused in the 1982 Atari 5200 game console, but games for the two systems are incompatible.\nThe 400 and 800 were replaced by multiple computers with the same technology and different presentation. The three models of the XL series were released in 1983: the 1200XL, 600XL, and 800XL. After the company was sold and reestablished, Atari Corporation released the XE series in 1985: the 65XE, also sold as the 800XE, and 130XE. The XL and XE are lighter in construction, have two joystick ports instead of four, and Atari BASIC is built-in. The 130XE has 128 KB of bank-switched RAM. In 1987, Atari Corporation repackaged the 65XE as a console, with an optional keyboard, as the Atari XEGS. It is backward compatible with computer software.\nTwo million Atari 8-bit computers were sold during its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985. In 1984, Atari reported 4 million owners of its computers and its 5200 game console combined. The 8-bit family was sold both in computer stores and department stores such as Sears using an in-store demo to attract customers.

The first operations on board an aircraft carrier commenced in November 1940.\nAt its height, 15 first-line FAA squadrons flew the Albacore. The type was much used in the Mediterranean, participating in the Battle of Cape Matapan, the Second Battle of El Alamein, as well as the landings at Sicily and Salerno.

Released in 1995, it was marketed as the first console capable of displaying stereoscopic \"3D\" graphics. The player uses the console like a head-mounted display, placing the head against the eyepiece to see a red monochrome display. The games use a parallax effect to create the illusion of depth. Sales failed to meet targets, and Nintendo ceased distribution and game development in 1996, having released only 22 games for the system.\nDevelopment of the Virtual Boy lasted four years and began under the project name VR32. Nintendo entered a licensing agreement to use a stereoscopic LED eyepiece technology which had been developed since the 1980s by US company Reflection Technology. It also built a factory in China to be used only for Virtual Boy manufacturing. Over the course of development, the console technology was downscaled due to high costs and potential health concerns, and an increasing amount of resources were reallocated to the development of the Nintendo 64, Nintendo's next home console. Lead game designer Shigeru Miyamoto had little involvement with the Virtual Boy software. The Virtual Boy was pushed to market in an unfinished state in 1995 to focus on the Nintendo 64.\nThe Virtual Boy was panned by critics and was a commercial failure, even after repeated price drops. Its failure has been attributed to its high price, dark display consisting of only red and black, unimpressive stereoscopic effect, poor ergonomics, lack of true portability, and health concerns due to it giving many players headaches, dizziness, nausea and eye pain. Stereoscopic technology in video game consoles reemerged in later years to more success, including Nintendo's 3DS handheld console.

First, there is an upright low speed setup, where the rider has a higher position and can have conversations face-to-face with pedestrians and can move among people. This upright position can be transformed while driving to a low position, where the rider sits much lower and more reclined. This high speed setup has a much lower center of gravity and is for driving at higher speeds.\nThe i-unit weighs 180 kilograms (400 lb). It contains a lithium ion battery and features Intelligent Transport System technology.  The rear wheels are powered by electric motors, and the device is steered with the front wheels. In the upright position it has a turning radius of 0.9 metres (35.4 in), which means it can turn on the spot. The vehicle is controlled by two joystick-like devices at the front of the armrests, and uses a Drive-by-wire technology. An Intelligent Transport System (ITS) technology aims to reduce the likelihood of accidents.\nThe color of the lights can change according to the preferences or emotions of the operator. The shape was designed to symbolize a leaf, and the design incorporates environmentally friendly materials such as kenaf.\nThis concept vehicle is used by Toyota for public relations, and they state that The \"i-unit\" is a form of \"personal mobility\" that seeks to attain a greater balance of meeting individuals' wishes to enjoy freedom of movement, harmony with society, and harmony with the Earth's natural environment.

It was the manufacturer's first car with a four-cylinder engine.   653 were produced.\nThe V4C3 was propelled using a four-cylinder 1,725 cm\u00b3 four-stroke engine, mounted ahead of the driver.   This was the first, and till now (2012) the only Peugeot to feature a V4 engine.   A maximum 9 hp of power was delivered to the rear wheels.\nThe car was the first of several Lion-Peugeot models that became known as a Lion-Peugeot 10 hp.   This was a reference to the car's fiscal horse power, applying a system of car classification for taxation purposes then being established in France.   Tax horsepower then, and for several decades to come, was defined purely as a function of the combined surface area of the engine's cylinders, this being far easier to assess consistently and accurately than the actual power produced by an engine.   At this stage fiscal horse-power tended to equate approximately to actual horse-power, although the two would diverge subsequently, as engines became more efficient at extracting power from a given sum of cylinder diameters.  Eventually, in the second half of the twentieth century, more complex (and less internationally consistent) definitions of fiscal horse power would replace those defined only by cylinder diameters.\nThe V4C3 shared its 2,250 mm wheel base with the manufacturer's models from the previous year such as their twin-cylinder Type V2C3.   The 3,200 mm (approximately) body length provided space for between two and four people depending on the body specified.   The wide range of different body types offered followed a pattern that by now would have been familiar to many Lion-Peugeot buyers.

It was the second turbojet-powered combat aircraft to be developed in Sweden, the first being the Saab 21R, and it was the first Western European fighter to be produced with a swept wing after the Second World War, only being preceded in Western Europe as a whole by the Messerschmitt Me 262 built during the conflict.Work on what would become the Tunnan commenced in late 1945. The design, internally designated R 1001, had a barrel-like fuselage, giving it a destinctive rotund appearance, from which its name is derived. A relatively thin swept wing configuration was adopted after wartime aerodynamic research from Germany indicated its favourable high speed qualities. It was powered by the recently-developed de Havilland Ghost turbojet engine. The Swedish Air Force placed an initial order for three prototypes under the service designation J 29 during Autumn 1946. On 1 September 1948, the first prototype performed its maiden flight; flight testing proved the aircraft to exceed performance estimates in several aspects.\nDuring May 1951, Br\u00e5valla Wing (F 13) received the first production aircraft. Five principal variants of the Tunnan were produced; the first model to enter service being the J 29A fighter, the more capable J 29B and J 29E fighters, and finally the afterburner-equipped J 29F fighter, which was the final fighter variant to be built. A dedicated aerial reconnaissance model, the S 29C, was also operated.

Originally released in its home market of Japan in late 1997 as the Toyota Harrier, export sales began in March 1998 as the Lexus RX.Considered as the first luxury crossover SUV, five generations of the RX have been produced to date, the first being compact in size, and the latter classified as mid-size. Both front- and four-wheel drive configurations have been used on the RX series, and several gasoline powertrain options, including V6 engines and hybrid systems, have been offered. In the Lexus model lineup, the RX sits below the larger Lexus LX (marketed as the Toyota Land Cruiser body-on-frame SUVs outside North America, respectively), and above the shorter and less wider, but taller GX SUV. The name \"RX\" stands for \"Radiant Crossover\". It has also been labelled as \"Recreational Cross Country\" in some markets. The RX's current Toyota counterpart is the Highlander/Kluger; past counterparts included the Harrier and Venza.\nThe first-generation RX 300, fitted with a 3.0-liter V6 engine, began sales in 1998. The Japanese market Harrier released in 1997 also offered a 2.2-liter inline-four, later uprated to 2.4 liters. The second-generation RX 300 (3.0-liter V6) and RX 330 (3.3-liter V6) models went on sale in 2003, with both variants supplanted by the more powerful RX 350 (3.5-liter V6) in 2006. Like the previous series, a 2.4-liter inline-four engine was sold alongside the 3.0-liter V6 in the Japanese market Harrier. In 2005, a hybridized gasoline-electric version of the 3.3-liter second-generation model was made available as the RX 400h in export markets and as the Harrier Hybrid in Japan. For the third generation released in 2009, both RX 350 (3.5-liter V6) and RX 450h (3.5-liter V6 hybrid) models were initially offered, with an entry-level RX 270 (2.7-liter inline-four) offered by Lexus in some Asian markets, including in Japan, since 2010.

However, several officials felt that the single-cabbed arrangement used by the majority of Type 1s presented drivers with visibility difficulties in the 'less convenient' direction. BR therefore approached several manufacturers to seek a new locomotive that had a centre cab and low bonnets to maximise visibility. Clayton were selected to produce their proposed locomotive as the Class 17. Its low engine covers required the use of a pair of Paxman 6ZHXL six-cylinder horizontal engines, which had been intended for powering railcars; it was a somewhat unorthodox arrangement for the era.\nProduction of the Class 17 was undertaken between 1962 and 1965, with the locomotives being assigned to the north of Britain and the Scottish Region. Early on it was determined that the locomotive was not suited to heavy freight trains, and they quickly acquired a reputation for unreliability largely due to the engines, which continued to deliver poor performance even after extensive modifications. The Class 17 proved to be one of the least successful of the Type 1s, such that by 1967, long lines of unserviceable locomotives could be found stored in less accessible sidings at various locations across the Central Belt of Scotland (e.g. Ardrossan and Millerhill).

{"id": "176_661", "question": "Which company is Selmer Mark VI produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_58266", "text": "The Selmer Mark VI is a saxophone produced from 1954 to 1981. Production shifted to the Mark VII for the tenor and alto in the mid-1970s (see discussion of serial numbers below), and to the Super Action 80 for the soprano and baritone saxophones in 1981. The sopranino saw limited production until about 1985.\nSelmer debuted the Mark VI in 1954 with sopranino, soprano, alto, tenor, baritone and bass saxophones, until the introduction of the Mark VII model in 1975.  Since the Mark VI design continued for sopraninos, sopranos, baritones, or bass saxes, they did not have a Mark VII model. There are reports of a limited number of baritone saxophones labeled as Mark VIIs, but these horns were of the same design as the Mark VI.\nAll Mark VI saxophones were manufactured in France. After manufacture, instruments designated for the British/Canadian or American markets were shipped unassembled and unengraved to their respective markets for completion. The style of engraving on the bell of the instrument is an indicator of the place of assembly.\n\nThe French-assembled Mark VI engraving is usually of a butterfly and floral motif, and the engraving typically extends to the bow. Some French-assembled Mark VIs lack any engraving other than the brand stamp. Nickel or silver-plated keys with a lacquer-finish body were offered among the French-assembled horns.\nThe British/Canadian Mark VIs often have a symmetrical medallion engraved on the front of the bell, and a design reminiscent of the chambered nautilus along the sides of the bell.\nAmerican-assembled Mark VIs have floral or scroll engraving, with only the earliest models extending to the bow. The Mark VI is played by many saxophonists including Jimmy Heath, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Maceo Parker, Kenny Garrett, Kenny G, Ornette Coleman, and David Sanborn.\nThe design of the Mark VI evolved over time. Switching over from its predecessor, officially named the Super Action but commonly called the Super Balanced Action, Selmer's earliest Mark VI models were transitional, incorporating design elements from the preceding model. Tonally, early examples are considered to have a \"dark\" tone, while later examples are thought of as having a \"bright\" sound. The bore taper, bow, neck designs, and some mechanical features changed throughout the history of the Mark VI. The changes were not documented by Selmer.  The length of the bow was increased on altos during the 85K serial number range to address certain intonation issues. In subsequent years the short bow was reintroduced. Some altos had baffles soldered into the bow to correct intonation issues.  At least three changes to neck design were made on the tenor during the 1950s and 1960s, and once again in the 1970s. Some contend that the neck design changes account for the different tonal and playing qualities between earlier and later Mark VIs. Others contend that Mark VIs produced after about SN 180,000 had harder metal as a result of a change in the metalworking process, however, that SN corresponds to a known change in neck design so differing characteristics before and after can not definitely be ascribed to metallurgy.\nLatter-year Mark VIs gained a reputation of being lower quality than early versions (possibly due to Selmer's higher annual production output of the popular saxophone), leading to a greater demand of early-year Mark VIs with a five-digit serial number.  An employee's description of the assembly and quality control process at Selmer USA during the 1960s indicated that different quality Mark VIs were sold through different channels; the top tier was offered to musicians under contract to Selmer (\"Selmer Artists\"), the second tier went to pro dealers in major markets, and the third tier went to the general market. Hence, the best assurance of the quality of a Mark VI may be its sale history, as more variability could be expected in the quality of horns initially sold in the general market.The high F\u266f key was offered as an option, though some players believe that instruments without the high F\u266f key have better natural intonation. During the mid-1960s optional keywork was offered, including the rare 'Concert' model with a high F#, right hand G#, D to E flat trill key and C to D trill key using the E flat palm key. There are also somewhat rare low A alto and baritone models. The low A baritone is especially sought after, whereas the low A alto model acquired a reputation, rightly or wrongly, for intonation issues. Nonetheless, Ornette Coleman played a low A alto.\nThe quality and ergonomics of the keywork design of the Mark VI can be observed in current saxophone designs: most modern saxophones have keywork that is based upon the basic Mark VI design.\nSelmer's General Manager Jerome Selmer has confirmed that all Mark VIs were manufactured from industry-standard 66/34 \"yellow brass\" stock and that Selmer never recycled shell casings.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Other sensors detect only one color at each site and interpolate to produce a full-color image.\nThe SD9 had two separate power systems; one set of CR-123A lithium batteries in the handgrip powered the camera functions, while another pair of CR-V3 batteries or four AA size rechargeable batteries in a battery tray in the base powered the digital functions.  This split power system showed that the camera functions (inherited from Sigma's SA-9 film SLR) were not integrated at all with the digital half.  \nAnother unusual feature of the SD9 was its \"dust cover\" filter right behind the lens mount, to prevent dust getting into the chamber and onto the sensor when changing lenses.Reviewers and users reported good results in good lighting, but poorer ones in low light using either high ISO sensitivity or longer exposures.\nThe SD9 was succeeded by an updated model, the SD10, which addressed the power and low-light issues.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Despite sharing the same chassis, the ZIL-4104 was as much as 314 kg (692 lb) heavier than the 114.\nMechanically, the ZIL-4104 also improved on the 114. The pushrod V8 engine of the 114 had its stroke increased from 95 mm (3.7 in) to 105 mm (4.1 in). With a 108 mm (4.3 in) bore, this meant the capacity increased from 6,959 cc (424.7 cu in) to 7,695 cc (469.6 cu in), which was throughout the model's lifespan one of the world's biggest passenger-car engines (Cadillac produced a 472 cu in (7,730 cc) engine, enlarged to 500 cu in (8,200 cc)). This engine developed 315 hp SAE Gross at 4,400 revs per minute and a substantial 608 N\u22c5m (448 lb\u22c5ft) at 2500 rpm.

The Lotus 30 was raced in British races such as Guards Trophy, international races such as Nassau Speed Week that allowed FIA Group 4 \"Sports Car\" class of racing machines, and more importantly, in Can Am series.  These were before the recognition and creation of Group 5, 6 and 7 categories by FIA in 1966.  This explains why Lotus 30 and 40 (the latter was built in 1965) came originally equipped with headlights, tail lights and a windscreen wiper.\nNotable for its curvilinear fibreglass body work and \"pickle fork\" backbone chassis first seen in the front engine Lotus Elan, On the 30 the layout was reversed and placed the engine behind the driver.  Lotus engineer Len Terry was asked by Chapman to comment on the draft concept and considered it to be so flawed he refused to have anything to do with it.  The Lotus 30 was powered by a 4.7 litre (289 c.i.) Ford V8 engine, the same type as used in the Ford GT40, mated to a 5 speed ZF synchromesh 5DS20 transaxle which was far more reliable than the Colotti transaxle used in the 19B against the torque of the V8.  It used 13 inch wheels and solid disc brakes on each wheel.  The Lotus 30 was regarded as unsuccessful and / or dangerous but when everything was working and nothing broke, the car was incredibly fast.\n\nThe inherent flaws of the engineering became evident as horse power requirements and tire technology of the period evolved and pushed the original design past its intended limits. The problems were mainly related to the torsional rigidity of the backbone chassis and materials available at the time, all of which resulted in chassis and suspension failures. \nJim Clark laboured long with the car, and managed to prise some promising results with it before it was replaced with the Lotus 40. Equipped with 15in wheels and vented disc brakes as well as a larger engine, the 40 was just as recalcitrant as the 30. The most telling comment about these Lotus race cars was made by the American driver Richie Ginther. When asked what he thought of the new Lotus 40, Ginther, a lugubrious Californian, said, \"Same as the 30 but with ten more mistakes\".\nThe effort was not a total loss as this chassis type proved to be perfectly acceptable for the lower powered Lotus Europa, and was used on the Esprit series cars with further development.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It has a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Together with the Lotus Elise / Exige, it is one of Lotus' most long-lived models.\nThe Esprit was among the first of the (near) straight-lined, hard-edge creased, and sometimes wedge-shaped, polygonal \"folded paper\" designs of the prolific, and highly successful Italian industrial and automotive designer Giorgetto Giugiaro. The Esprit's backbone chassis was later adapted to carry the body of the DeLorean car, another low-bodied, Giugiaro-drawn, sharp-creased, wedge-shaped sportscar design. In 1978, the first updates led to the series 2 and 2.2 L (134 cu in) engined Esprit S2.2, made until the 1982\u20131988 Series 3 and Turbo Esprit models, that used a 1980 Giugiaro designed aerodynamic and aesthetic restyling package.\nThe Lotus Esprit however, lived on through the 1990s, and into the 2000s. It received its first significant restyling by designer Peter Stevens, who also did styling on the McLaren F1. Stevens gave the Esprit overall softer lines and shapes, but the car did not get a new series number \u2013 it is instead often just called the 'Stevens Esprit', or by its project number, the X180, made from 1988 to 1994.\nIn 1994, an official Series 4 Esprit, drawn by designer Julian Thomson, had a further rounded shape, especially the bumper sections and lower body of the car. Styling-wise, this became the most long-lived Esprit (1994\u20132004), only receiving its last changes, by Russell Carr in 2002.\nOver the years, the performance of the Esprit's 4-cylinder engine was increased from around 150 PS (148 hp; 110 kW) and just under 200 N\u22c5m (148 lb\u22c5ft) of torque, to double those power figures, mainly through greater inlet and exhaust flow, and strong turbo-charging. And from 1996, a new 3.5 L (214 cu in) V8 twin-turbo engine was added, offering 355 PS (350 hp; 261 kW). Contrary to a long list of low-volume British (sports) cars, with the 3.5 l Rover V8 engine, the Esprit received a Lotus in-house designed V8. Top speed rose from some 214 km/h (133 mph) in 1976, to over 280 km/h (174 mph) for the V8, twenty years later.\nAfter a 28-year production run, the Esprit was one of the last cars made with pop-up headlights, together with the 5th generation Chevrolet Corvette.", "hasanswer": true}]}

In particular, these changes included a touch-optimized Windows shell and start screen based on Microsoft's Metro design language, integration with online services, the Windows Store, and a new keyboard shortcut for screenshots. Many of these features were adapted from Windows Phone. Windows 8 also added support for USB 3.0, Advanced Format, near-field communication, and cloud computing. Additional security features\u2014including built-in antivirus software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering, and support for Secure Boot on supported devices\u2014were introduced.

No CPUs without PAE, SSE2 and NX are supported in this version.\nWindows 8 received a mostly negative reception. Although the reaction to its performance improvements, security enhancements, and improved support for touchscreen devices was positive, the new user interface was widely criticized as confusing and unintuitive, especially when used with a keyboard and mouse rather than a touchscreen. Despite these shortcomings, 60 million licenses were sold through January 2013, including upgrades and sales to OEMs for new PCs.Microsoft released Windows 8.1 in October 2013, which addressed some aspects of Windows 8 that were criticized by reviewers and early adopters and also incorporated various improvements.

She took part in the ill-fated Namsos Campaign of 1940, where she was used to defend allied troop ships entering and leaving Namsos harbour from submarine attacks.  The harbour came under regular air attack by the Luftwaffe, and on 30 April, Bittern was spotted by a squadron of Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers.  Bittern came under repeated attack from 0700 hours onwards. She was hit and severely damaged, being set on fire by a bomb dropped from Oberleutnant Elmo Sch\u00e4fer's aircraft belonging to I./StG 1. Nearby allied ships came alongside and took the survivors off.  When this had been completed, Bittern was sunk by a torpedo from the destroyer Janus.In 2011 it was reported that the ship has started to leak oil and contained roughly 200,000 litres (44,000 imp gal; 53,000 US gal) of oil.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The T-34 had a profound effect on the conflict on the Eastern Front, and had a long-lasting impact on tank design. The tank was praised by multiple German generals when encountered during Operation Barbarossa, although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war. Its main strength was its cost and production time, meaning that German panzer forces would often fight against Soviet tank forces several times their size. The T-34 is also a critical part of the mechanized divisions that form the backbone of the Deep Battle Strategy.\nThe T-34 was the mainstay of the Soviet Red Army armoured forces throughout the war. Its general specifications remained nearly unchanged until early 1944, when it received a firepower upgrade with the introduction of the greatly improved T-34-85 variant. Its production method was continuously refined and rationalized to meet the needs of the Eastern Front, making the T-34 quicker and cheaper to produce. The Soviets ultimately built over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded despite the loss of tens of thousands in combat against the German Wehrmacht.Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most-produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/T-55 series). With 44,900 lost during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses ever.

It was not sold in the US.\nIn 1980, the first batch of 110 naked versions were rushed to Australia specifically with the aim of winning the world renowned Castrol 6 Hour race.   The Honda did indeed win with future world champion Wayne Gardner and Australian champion Andrew Johnson riding.  The organisers of the event then prevented the single seat Honda from entering the 1981 Castrol 6 Hour as they deemed it a \"race special\".  In 1981, the CB1100R won the New Zealand Castrol Six Hour ridden by Australian pair of Malcolm Campbell and Mick Cole.  The CB1100R was slightly modified to have a dual seat so as to reclassify it as a road bike, so allowing it to enter the 1982 Castrol 6 Hour, and duly won this premier Australian production race in 1982, the Castrol Six Hour in the hands of future 1987 500cc GP World Champion Wayne Gardner and teammate Wayne Clark. Other CB1100Rs finished the race 2nd, 3rd and 4th, with 6 CB11000Rs finishing in the top 8 spots. The Australasian success of the CB1100R lead directly to the development of the Suzuki GSX1100SXZ Katana homologation racing specials.\nThe model designations are CB1100RB (1980 and 1981), CB1100RC (1982), and CB1100RD (1983). In 1980/81, 1050 units were sold, followed by 1500 per year in 1982 and 1983. The 1981 'RB' was half faired with a solo seat only. The 82 and 83 models have different bodywork including a full fairing, aluminium fuel tank, and pillion seat covered with a removable seat cowl. The 82 (RC) and 83 (RD) were largely similar in appearance, yet with considerable differences what concerns the full fairing and dashboard layout. None of the fairing parts of any of the 3 models are interchangeable with one another. The RC fairing, fairing bracket and dashboard combo was only made for the RC and  does not interchange in any way with the RD, which had a slightly shorter overall length. Other differences include the paint scheme, rear swing arm design and color and front fork design. In 1983 the Honda CB1100F was launched that essentially was a blend of the CB1100R and the CB900F, for a broader market. The 1981 CB1100RB had a claimed 115 hp (86 kW) @ 9000 rpm.\n\n\n== Notes ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

Sovereign held this distinction until 1990 when Norway succeeded her after being refurbished with the addition of two more decks. In 1991, Royal Caribbean International launched a slightly modified sister ship, Monarch of the Seas. In 1992, the line launched its third and final sister ship, Majesty of the Seas. These ships were among the largest modern cruise ships to sail during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nDuring that time, other major cruise lines also followed suit, building ships that included many of the same features and similar dimensions as the Sovereign class. Carnival Cruise Lines launched the Fantasy class in 1990, comparable in size to the Sovereign class and also featuring a multi-story atrium with glass elevators.

Like its Brazilian predecessor, the FNM 2000, the 2300 featured a four-cylinder twin camshaft engine, now of 2,310 cc with a claimed output of 140 hp (100 kW). A maximum speed of 170 km/h (106 mph) was claimed. In the 1985 model year leaflet the 2300 was called as \"Alfa Romeo 85\". This model was supposedly manufactured until November 1986, although a final 243 Alfa Romeos were built in Brazil in 1987.As demand for ethanol-powered cars rose, a stockpile of petrol-powered 2300s built up: as a result, Alfa Romeo foisted the Brazilian Alfa Romeo onto European (Dutch, Swiss, and German) importers in 1981 under the designation Alfa Romeo 2300 Rio. Around 600 of the cars were shipped to The Netherlands. The cars proved nearly unsellable and severe quality issues further deteriorated Alfa Romeo's image in Central and Northern Europe, with the importers eventually being forced to buy back the majority of the cars brought over. In the Netherlands, the bought back cars were sold on to used car dealers after three years in outdoors storage; without warranties the already decaying cars caused severe damage to Alfa Romeo's already crumbling reputation. The only real value of the Rio seems to have been to provide parts for restorers of vintage Alfa Romeo 1900s.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "176_995", "question": "Which company is Lotus Mark IX produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_59460", "text": "The Lotus Mark IX (1955) was an aluminium-bodied sports racing car manufactured by Lotus Engineering Ltd. About thirty of the Mark IX sports racing cars were made. It was closely related to the Lotus model Mark VIII (1954), of which only about seven cars were made. These cars were largely based on the innovative space frame of the Lotus Mark VI (1952).  The highly aerodynamic bodies were designed by Frank Costin and constructed by Williams & Pritchard Limited.\nDuring this early era, of 1954\u20131955, Lotus Engineering was still a fledgling company, and cars were delivered in different states of completion on special orders.  Similar to the Mark VIII, the Mark IX was available in various configurations and different engines, including the 1500 cc MG, 1500 cc Connaught and 2-litre Bristol were fitted. However, the Mark IX designation is most often powered by the 1100 cc Coventry Climax engine. Apparently, two models of Mark IX were offered \u2013 the \"Club\" and the \"Le Mans\", the latter of which had larger drum brakes fitted.\n\nThe chassis of the Mark IX was a new design, compared to that of the Mark VIII. Both were space frames of brazed steel tube. The new chassis was an advance over the Mark VIII in terms of the efficiency of its design and avoiding the VIII's need for diaphragm-stiffening panels. However, both chassis still used an oversized lower rail of 1.8-inch (5 cm) tube, a hang-over from the original design of the first Mark VI space frame. Compared to the Mark VIII, the Mark IX was shortened somewhat to a wheelbase of 7 feet 3.5 inches (2.22 m), and the body itself was about two feet (0.6 m) shorter than that of the Mark VIII. This was so that Colin Chapman could fit it on his transporter.A total of about thirty of the Mark IX sports racing cars were produced in various forms, and these were successfully raced in both Europe and the US. The first two examples of the Mark IX were apparently delivered to the US with the 1100 cc Coventry Climax engine to compete in the 1955 running of the 12 Hours of Sebring race and were beaten by a Porsche Spyder.  These cars were actually entered as Lotus Mark VIII models in the G class by Frank Miller of Larchmont, NY and by Bobby Burns and Norman J. Scott of Houston TX in, respectively, car numbers 78 and 79. The Lotus Works Team entered at least one Mark IX in the Le Mans 24 hour race in 1955, driven by Chapman, which may have been equipped with disc brakes. However, the car was disqualified apparently due to his reversing the car to re-enter the race track after going off course.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}
