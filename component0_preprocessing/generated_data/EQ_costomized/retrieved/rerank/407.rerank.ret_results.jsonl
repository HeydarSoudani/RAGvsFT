{"id": "407_2", "question": "Which language was Il ritorno di Tobia written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_5339", "text": "Il ritorno di Tobia (The Return of Tobias) is an oratorio in two parts composed in 1775 by Joseph Haydn (Hob. XXI:1). The work is the first oratorio the composer wrote and, according to Jones, was \"his most extended and ambitious composition up to that time\".The Italian-language libretto of the work is by Giovanni Gastone Boccherini, brother of the composer Luigi Boccherini. This libretto is harshly criticized by Olleson, who notes that the author de-dramatizes vivid episodes in the source (the story of Tobit in the Apocrypha), depriving Haydn of the opportunity for highly dramatic musical utterance.The work was premiered in Vienna on 2 April 1775, under the sponsorship of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, a musician's benevolent society. The musical forces were substantial: Smither writes: \"characteristic of the large forces used for the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t concerts, the orchestra, chorus, and soloists possibly numbered more than 180 performers.\" He adds that the premiere was \"enormously successful.\"In 1784, Haydn substantially revised the work, with cuts to make numbers shorter and new choruses, for another of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t's benefit concerts. It is thought that at this concert Haydn first met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who became his good friend. One of the soprano soloists was Nancy Storace, also a friend of Haydn, who later was Mozart's first Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro.In 1808 the oratorio made a third appearance on the program of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, this time in a revised version by the now-elderly composer's pupil, Sigismund Neukomm. The performance on the night of 22 December, which required the labors of most of the highly qualified musicians in Vienna, had regrettable consequences for a now-famous rival concert taking place in Vienna on the same evening, the benefit for Ludwig van Beethoven that premiered his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies.\nToday, Il ritorno di Tobia is eclipsed by Haydn's later works in this genre \u2013 The Creation and The Seasons \u2013 and is seldom performed or recorded.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Since the beginning, the heading of La Capital included a motto showing a commitment to public opinion: Las columnas de La Capital pertenecen al pueblo, \"La Capital's columns belong to the people\".\nOn 19 August 1868 the editorial building was at 104 Santa Fe St. After that, La Capital turned into a morning newspaper, and in 1870 it moved to Port St. (now Buenos Aires St.). In 1874 and again in 1887 new printing machinery was acquired. In 1889 the editorial moved to a new building at 763 Sarmiento St. and acquired a French Marinoni reaction printer.\nIn 1903 the newspaper changed the format of its pages, abandoning the large sheet sizes. By 1905 the daily edition had 16 pages, and in 1906 it offered a full-color 28-page illustrated supplement.\nFor 111 years, since its foundation, the newspaper employed the \"hot type\" method, that is, with Linotype typesetting machines where molten lead and antimony were used to cast each line of text. In 1978 La Capital shifted to \"cold type\", using the phototypesetting method.\nIn mid-1998 the new publishing plant at Santiago St. near Rivadavia Ave. received its latest innovation, a Goss Urbanite rotating press which weighs 165 tonnes and measures almost 36 m in length. The new plant also features a number of other technologies. Using this, La Capital started a new edition, with a different layout and format, and fully in color.\nBesides national and international news, the newspaper covers local news from Rosario and its metropolitan area (Greater Rosario), plus other towns in the region and four other provinces besides Santa Fe, reaching about 2 million readers.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The most obvious sign of such an influence is the song \"Big Brother\"; Big Brother is the dictatorial political leader figure in Orwell's novel. The song revolves around how \"Big Brother is watching you\", and when Dick Lucas sings \"there's a TV in my front room and it's screwing up my head\", it is a comparison between the telescreen in the novel which monitored citizens constantly and excessive viewing of mass media. Today, there is a huge amount of video surveillance in the United Kingdom, showing the foresight of this subject matter. Like the novel, the album has dystopian overtones.\nIt also describes a world ravaged by war, most likely our world which arguably is, this is suggested by track titles such as \"Dying World\" and \"All Gone Dead\".

Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms in use, including \"Practical Extraction and Reporting Language\".Perl was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl originally was not capitalized and the name was changed to being capitalized by the time Perl 4 was released. The latest release is Perl 5, first released in 1994. From 2000 to October 2019 a sixth version of Perl was in development, before the latter's name was officially changed to Raku. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams which liberally borrow ideas from each other.\nPerl borrows features from other programming languages including C, sh, AWK, and sed. It provides text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools. Perl is a highly expressive programming language: source code for a given algorithm can be short and highly compressible.Perl gained widespread popularity in the mid-1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its powerful regular expression and string parsing abilities. In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been nicknamed \"the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages\" because of its flexibility and power.

Not to mention the difference in vocabulary. Javanese There are currently three dialects of Javanese in Indramayu Regency. The majority are Dermayu dialects (Indramayu). But there is also a Javanese dialect of Cerbon (Cirebon), namely in Krangkeng Village, Kalianyar, and around it in Krangkeng District, which borders Cirebon Regency. The Tegal-Brebes dialect of Javanese language also exists in the western region of Indramayu Regency because in the 1920s there was migration from Tegal-Brebes to the region, namely in several villages or blocks in the Haurgeulis, Anjatan, Patrol, Sukra, and Bongas Districts. The Javanese language dialect Dermayu is mostly used by the people of Indramayu, who total about 1.894 million people in 2023. There are two levels in the Dermayu dialect of Javanese which is a social dialect (sociolect), namely the bagongan level or ngoko and the level of freedom or besiken or krama. It is estimated that the residents who control the freedom are around 20%-40%.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, dystopic metropolis called Mega-City One that lies in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Dredd and his rookie partner, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey high-rise block of apartments and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).\nGarland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new Judge Dredd film adaptation, unrelated to the 1995 film Judge Dredd, was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio DNA Films, Dredd began principal photography, using 3D cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on practical sets and locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg.\nDredd was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action sequences, while criticism focused on excessive violence as well as a perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30\u201345 million.

The story consists largely of a dialogue between recently deceased occupants of graves in a cemetery, most of whom are fully conscious and retain all the features of their living personalities. The dialogue is overheard by a troubled writer who has lain down near the graves.\nThe title \"Bobok\" refers to a nonsensical utterance repeatedly made by one of the cemetery's residents, an almost completely decomposed corpse who is otherwise silent. The writer also reports a kind of auditory hallucination of the word prior to his hearing of the dialogue. The sound suggests \"little bean\" in Russian, but in the context of the story is taken to be synonymous with gibberish.The philosopher and literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin regarded Bobok as one of the finest works in the literary tradition of Menippean satire, and argues that it encapsulates many of the thematic concerns of Dostoevsky's major novels.", "hasanswer": true}]}

With their producer, Nigel Godrich, Radiohead recorded most of OK Computer in their rehearsal space in Oxfordshire and the historic mansion of St Catherine's Court in Bath in 1996 and early 1997. They distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work.\nThe album's lyrics depict a dystopian, futuristic world fraught with rampant consumerism, capitalism, social and modern alienation, emotional isolation and political malaise, with overall themes like transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism; in this capacity, OK Computer is said to have prescient insight into the mood of 21st-century life. The band used unconventional production techniques, including natural reverberation, and no audio separation. Strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Most of the album was recorded live.\nDespite lowered sales estimates by EMI, who deemed the record uncommercial and difficult to market, OK Computer reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and debuted at number 21 on the Billboard 200, Radiohead's highest album entry on the US charts at the time, and was soon certified five times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. \"Paranoid Android\", \"Karma Police\", \"Lucky\" and \"No Surprises\" were released as singles. The album expanded Radiohead's international popularity and has sold at least 7.8 million units worldwide.\nOK Computer received acclaim and has been cited as one of the greatest albums of all time. It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Alternative Music Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album initiated a stylistic shift in British rock away from Britpop toward melancholic, atmospheric alternative rock that became more prevalent in the next decade.

The music was written by Aleksandra Pakhmutova, with lyrics by Nikolai Dobronravov and Sergey Grebennikov.\"Tenderness\" was one of the most beloved songs from cosmonaut of the USSR, and the most beloved \u2014 the first cosmonaut of the planet Earth \u2014 Yuri Gagarin. Yevgeny Dolmatovsky recalled in the book \"Stories about your songs\" (1973):\n\"Tenderness\" is like a spell of a woman, a friend of the pilot, who released her beloved to the stars and is waiting for his return. The source of the song is the hour and a half that it took Yuri Gagarin to fly around the globe, the hours and minutes that other cosmonauts and <test-pilot> Georgy Mosolov spent on daring flights. It is not by chance that the poets Grebennikov and Dobronravov remembered Exup\u00e9ry. One of the first to talk ably about the experiences and feelings of a man who has gained wings, this dreamer and warrior, and cosmonauts, including Yuri Gagarin, often told poets: write about Exup\u00e9ry!In order for a song to be born and turned out, many circumstances, impressions, finds are needed. It is important to remember that Yuri Gagarin brought the authors to the song \"Tenderness\". He loved this song very much, sang it together with his comrades, specially went to listen \u2014 so that not on the radio, not on TV, but here, next to it, it sounded.\nNezhnost' was performed in 1967 by Tatiana Doronina (as Nyura) in Tatiana Lioznova's film Tri topolya na Plyushchikhe (Three Poplars at Plyuschikha Street). Originally it was recorded by Maya Kristalinskaya in 1966. According to the memoirs of Chermen Kasaev (music editor of Radio in the Soviet Union and Soviet Central Television), when listening to a final record, Maya had tears dripping from her eyes. B. Serebrennikova wrote in the book \"Singers of Soviet Pop\" (1977) that \"All critics who wrote about \"Tenderness\" noted that this is the pinnacle of Kristalinskaya's art and in general a masterpiece of song performance creativity.\"It was covered many times by many artists in Soviet Union and Russia, including versions made by Yuri Gulyayev, Joseph Kobzon, Tamara Sinyavskaya, Lyudmila Zykina, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Tamara Gverdtsiteli, Maria Codrianu, Latvian singer Olga P\u012br\u0101gs.

Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances that drew on elements of jazz, ambient, blues, classical music, and dub.

Despite its mixed reception, the album's stature grew more favourable in subsequent years, with contemporary critics describing Spirit of Eden as an underrated masterpiece, and early progenitor of the post-rock genre.

It originates from the Irish noble Gallagher family of County Donegal, Ireland. In Ireland, the anglicized version of the name \"Gallagher\" is pronounced /\u02c8\u0261\u0252l\u0259\u02cch\u0259r/ in County Donegal in Ulster, while elsewhere in the country it is most frequently pronounced as /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6l\u0259\u02cch\u0259r/. Outside Ireland, the pronunciation is often altered to /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6l\u0259\u02cc\u0261\u0259r/ in Britain and the USA. The name Gallagher is an anglicization of the Irish surname \u00d3 Gallchobhair, \u00d3 Gallchobhoir (or two alternative spelling forms, \u00d3 Gallch\u00f3ir and \u00d3 Gallach\u00f3ir), these being masculine forms; the corresponding feminine forms are N\u00ed Ghallchobhair (newer forms N\u00ed Ghallch\u00f3ir and N\u00ed Ghallach\u00f3ir). At least 30 recorded alternate variants exist, including O'Gallagher, Gallacher, Gallager, Gallaher, Gallocher, Galliher, Gollaher, Gollihar and Gallahue.\nThe earliest recorded incidence of the name is in a fragment of a manuscript currently in the Royal Library of Brussels, which states the name \"Gallchubhair\". A similarly earlier mention occurs in the Annals of the Four Masters, where it is recorded that Mael Cobo \u00dai Gallchobhar, Abbot of Scrin Adamnain, died in 1022 AD. Gallchobhar was the one given the role of founding father of the clan at the advent of widespread surname usage in Ireland, which began around the 10th century.\nAs with other modern Irish last names, \u00d3 Gallch\u00f3ir similarly appears to be a conjoined compound word.\nMost Gallaghers are found in the Americas, where approximately 60% of Gallaghers originate. The United States is the home to 55% of Gallaghers. Gallagher is also the most common surname in County Donegal (D\u00fan na nGall means \"fort of the foreigner\"), and thus is very common in Derry, and is the fourteenth-most-common by birth records in Ireland. In the United States, it was ranked by the 2020 US Census as the 482nd most common name.  According to Professor Edward MacLysaght, in the mid-20th century Gallagher was one of the most common Irish surnames, most of the recorded births being located in the northern province, Ulster, and the western province, Connacht, with the majority being recorded in the homeland of the sept\u2014County Donegal in Ulster.

In 1990, the EBU made a new rule requiring contestants to be aged 16 or older before the contest; this age rule still operates.\nThe song was performed twelfth on the night, following Portugal's Ant\u00f3nio Calv\u00e1rio with \"Ora\u00e7\u00e3o\" and preceding Yugoslavia's Sabahudin Kurt with \"\u017divot je sklopio krug\". By the close of voting, it had received 49 points, placing it first in a field of 16.\n\"Non ho l'et\u00e0\" became a considerable commercial success for Cinquetti, in Italy, the rest of Europe, Scandinavia and other countries worldwide; she also recorded the song in English (\"This is my prayer\"), Spanish (\"No tengo edad\"), French (\"Je suis \u00e0 toi\"), German (\"Luna nel blu\"), and Japanese (\"Yumemiru omoi\", \u5922\u307f\u308b\u60f3\u3044). The song has since been recorded by a wide range of artists in other languages, for example, in Icelandic as \"Heyr m\u00edna b\u00e6n\" by Ell\u00fd Vilhj\u00e1lms. Lili Ivanova, a famous Bulgarian singer, and Hong Kong singer Rebecca Pan, covered the song in 1964. Polish-Belarusian singer Wies\u0142awa Drojecka covered the song in Polish (\"Nie wolno mi\"). Anneli Sari made a Finnish cover (\"Liian nuori rakkauteen\"). Sandra Reemer recorded the song in Dutch (\"Als jij maar wacht\").\nThe song was followed as contest winner in 1965 by France Gall singing \"Poup\u00e9e de cire, poup\u00e9e de son\" for Luxembourg. It was followed as Italian representative that year by Bobby Solo with \"Se piangi, se ridi\".\nCinquetti later returned to perform at the contest in 1974, when she finished second with \"S\u00ec\", behind ABBA's \"Waterloo\". In 1991, she co-hosted the contest in Rome alongside Toto Cutugno. In 2022, she performed the song as an interval act at the Eurovision final in Turin.\nCinquetti was proved not to be a UK 'one-hit-wonder' when an English recording of her 1974 Eurovision entry (titled \"Go\") reached #8 in the UK chart.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Zenyatta and Mondatta are invented words, hinting at Zen, at Jomo Kenyatta, at the French for 'the world' (le monde), and at reggatta, from the title of the previous Police album, Reggatta de Blanc. As Copeland explained:\n\nIt means everything. It's the same explanation that applies to the last two. It doesn't have a specific meaning like \"Police Brutality\" or \"Police Arrest\", or anything predictable like that. Being vague it says a lot more. You can interpret it in a lot of different ways. It's not an attempt to be mysterious, just syllables that sound good together, like the sound of a melody that has no words at all has a meaning. Miles (Stewart Copeland's brother and group manager) came up with \"Trimondo Blondomina\". Very subtle. Geddit? Like three blondes and the world. Then somebody thought of \"Caprido Von Renislam\". That rolls off the tongue. It was the address of the studio.\nJerry Moss, co-founder of A&M Records, named the champion racehorse Zenyatta (born 2004) after the album. Blizzard Entertainment also named a character Zenyatta (and his brother, non-playable character \u2013 Mondatta) in the video game Overwatch. Additionally, in the English translation of the manga Stardust Crusaders published by VIZ Media, the characters Oingo and Boingo are renamed Zenyatta and Mondatta due to copyright laws.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was edited by Marathi writer Shankar Dattatraya Javdekar from 1950 to 1952. Yadunath Thatte became Sadhana's editor in 1956 and continued to lead it until 1982. G.P. Pradhan was the next editor of the weekly.\nIn the early 1970s the magazine provided a forum for voices from the Dalit Panther movement, who were revolting against the treatment of low castes in Indian society. Some of the Dalit writings published by the magazine were considered to be inflammatory by the middle class and even led to calls to ban the concerned issues. Sadhana brought the Dalit activists to the attention to the Marathi intelligentsia, and gave an impetus to the growing dalit movement.The magazine served as a voice for Socialist thought in India and played a key role in the mass awakening during the 21-month-long Emergency Rule in India that was imposed in June 1975. In July 1976, the Government of India led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi intimidated the weekly to stop publication by abusive use of national defence laws. The magazine soon reopened, after winning a landmark court case concerning press freedom in which Justice V.D. Tulzapurkar of the Bombay High Court along with Justice B.C.

The band, initially called Roundabout, was the idea of former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis, who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore before leaving the project. The Mk. I line-up of the band was completed by vocalist/frontman Rod Evans, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice, in March 1968.\nAfter about two months of rehearsals, Shades of Deep Purple was recorded in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic. Stylistically, the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s.\nThe album was not well received in the UK, where it sold very few copies and did not chart. In the US, on the other hand, it was a success and the single \"Hush\", an energetic rock track written by Joe South and originally recorded by Billy Joe Royal, became very popular at the time, reaching number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The good sales of the album and the intense radio play of the single contributed largely to the attention Deep Purple would get in their early US tours and also during the 1970s.

The band wrote and recorded eight new songs for the album in early 1974 at Headley Grange, a country house in Hampshire, which gave them ample time to improvise arrangements and experiment with recording. The total playing time covered just under three sides of an LP, so they decided to expand it into a double album by including previously unreleased tracks from the sessions for the band's earlier albums Led Zeppelin III (1970), Led Zeppelin IV (1971) and Houses of the Holy (1973). The album covered a range of styles including hard rock, progressive rock, rock 'n' roll and folk. The album was then mixed over summer 1974 and planned for an end-of-year release; however, its release was delayed because the Peter Corriston-designed die-cut album cover proved difficult to manufacture.\nPhysical Graffiti was commercially and critically successful upon its release and debuted at number one on album charts in the UK and number three in the US. It was promoted by a successful US tour and a five-night residency at Earl's Court, London. The album has been reissued on CD several times, including an expansive 40th anniversary edition in 2015.

This was shown me by the number of men who wished me hearty success with my new discovery and by the number of translations into foreign languages. For, not only was the book translated into twelve European languages, since I myself have seen these translations (Latin, Greek, Bohemian, Polish, German, Swedish, Dutch, English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Hungarian), but also into the Asiatic languages \u2014 Arabic, Turkish, and Persian \u2014 and even into the Mongolian, which is understood by all the East Indies.\nThere are 101 editions in Czech libraries published during Comenius' lifetime; 18 more editions were issued before the end of the 17th century.

Their grammatical forms and meanings have been reconstructed by modern linguists, based on similarities found across all Indo-European languages. This article discusses nouns and adjectives; Proto-Indo-European pronouns are treated elsewhere.\nThe Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) had eight or nine cases, three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and probably originally two genders (animate and neuter), with the animate later splitting into the masculine and the feminine.\nNominals fell into multiple different declensions. Most of them had word stems ending in a consonant (called athematic stems) and exhibited a complex pattern of accent shifts and/or vowel changes (ablaut) among the different cases.\nTwo declensions ended in a vowel (*-o/e-) and are called thematic; they were more regular and became more common during the history of PIE and its older daughter languages.\nPIE very frequently derived nominals from verbs. Just as English giver and gift are ultimately related to the verb give, *d\u00e9h\u2083tors 'giver' and *d\u00e9h\u2083nom 'gift' are derived from *deh\u2083- 'to give', but the practice was much more common in PIE.
