The car had an eight-in-line engine with a displacement of no less than 12,760 cc, delivering 80 bhp (60 kW) at 1300 rpm. The event was a total failure for the Dufaux brothers as their car with the number 7 not even could start because of a broken wheel. This car still exists and is permanently exhibited at the Mus\u00e9e Nationale de l'automobile (Collection Schlumpf / Cit\u00e9 de l'Automobile) in Mulhouse (France). As Frenchman L\u00e9on Th\u00e9ry on Richard-Brasier won the race, France had to organize the cup for 1905.Later, the brothers won a race at Geneva over a distance of one kilometer at an average speed of 72 mph (116 km/h).\nAt a second race in Paris, the brothers came in second place. The car had actually been driven from Switzerland to Paris in less than 10 hours.\nThe official Gordon Bennett homepage mentions an 80 HP Dufaux with a straight eight-cylinder engine entering the 1905 event. The race was held in the Auvergne near Paris. As the result list neither mentions the Dufaux brother nor their car, it is safe to conclude that they didn't make it to the start. Again, L\u00e9on Th\u00e9ry on Richard-Brasier won the cup. This was the last Gordon Bennett cup for automobiles.Another model built by the brothers was given a monstrous four-cylinder engine with 26,400 cc. This big engine gave more than 150 bhp (110 kW). Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dufaux broke with this car the world record on 13 November 1905 at a speed of 98 mph (158 km/h) . He completed a kilometer in just 23 seconds.In 1906, more cars were built. Most of them had a smaller four-cylinder engine. An eight-cylinder with 120 bhp (89 kW) was also built. In a hill climb in Marchairuz in 1906, four Dufaux models took place in the starting line. Two of them were eight-cylinders with 12,760 cc and 14,449 cc, respectively, and one a more modern four-cylinder with 4,400 cc.\nUnfortunately, manufacturing of race cars became too expensive, so they ceased production in 1907.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.In 1803 an act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the East India Docks) primarily for the use of ships trading with India.

Elector Frederick William developed it into a viable standing army, while King Frederick William I of Prussia dramatically increased its size and improved its doctrines.

Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer. The video game crash of 1983, in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the experience of Activision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games and forced the company to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of Infocom. After a management shift, with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis, the company renamed itself to Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications. Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around US$500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991.\nKotick drastically revamped and restructured the company to get it out of debt: dismissing most of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to the Activision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from its former financial troubles, started acquiring numerous studios and various types of intellectual property over the 1990s and 2000s, among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series. A holding company was formed as Activision's parent company to manage both its internal and acquired studios. In 2008, this holding company merged with Vivendi Games (the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment) and formed Activision Blizzard, with Kotick as its CEO.

It was initially an umbrella organization coordinating all the right-wing party militias of the Lebanese Front and served as the main resistance force of the front. The Kataeb Regulatory Forces provided the largest share of fighters, and the Kataeb Party had the largest share on the council. Despite its original creation from party militias, the Lebanese Forces accepted new recruits without any specific party allegiance.\nDuring the civil war, the Lebanese Forces fought different opponents at different times: the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the Lebanese National Movement, the Lebanese National Resistance Front, the Syrian Army, the Druze-dominated Progressive Socialist Party in the Chouf, and the Lebanese Army loyal to General Michel Aoun. After the assassination of its leader, Bachir Gemayel, in 1982, political friction within the Lebanese Front resulted in growing distance between the Kataeb militants and the rest of the Lebanese Forces. In the end, the Lebanese Forces and Kataeb became two separate forces within the Lebanese Front. A few uprisings led to Lebanese Forces commander-in-chief Samir Geagea taking over and dissolving the Lebanese Front in the late 1980s.\nAfter the civil war ended, Geagea created the Lebanese Forces Party. In 1994, while Lebanon was under Syrian occupation, the party was banned, Geagea imprisoned and the activities of its militants repressed by the Lebanese services in Lebanon. The Lebanese Forces returned as a political force after the Cedar Revolution in early 2005, which resulted in a withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.

The Brothers Radi\u0107 believed that the realization of Croatian statehood was possible within Austria-Hungary, but that it had to be reformed as a Monarchy divided into three equal parts \u2013 Austria, Hungary, Croatia. After the creation of Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1918, Party requested for the Croatian part of the Kingdom to be based on self-determination. This brought them great public support which culminated in 1920 parliamentary election when HPSS won all 58 seats assigned to Croatia.\nIn 1920, disgruntled with a bad position of Croats in the Kingdom, the party changed its name into Croatian Republican Peasant Party (HRSS) and started advocating secession from the Kingdom and the establishment of \"peaceful peasant Republic of Croatia\". On 1923 and 1925 election, HRSS doubled the number of won votes, and has thus become the second largest party in the Parliament.\nIn 1927, faced with a constant prosecution by the regime, HRSS was forced to soften its policy, change its name into Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), recognize the Vidovdan Constitution and form a coalition with Serbian People's Radical Party. This resulted in HSS losing its popularity which was seen in 1927 election when it lost almost third of votes won in the previous elections. After the termination of the coalition agreement with the Radicals, HSS formed Peasant-Democratic Coalition with Pribi\u010devi\u0107's Independent Democratic Party. In 1928, Vladko Ma\u010dek become the new president of HSS after the assassination of Stjepan Radi\u0107.\nAfter King Alexander declared dictatorship in 1929, HSS was banned and its members prosecuted. HSS participated in the 1935 and 1938 election as a part of the United opposition coalition which helped it to regain its influence. In 1939, Cvetkovi\u0107\u2013Ma\u010dek Agreement helped in the establishing of the HSS-governed Banovina of Croatia. After the establishment of Nazi-puppet state, the so-called Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in 1941, HSS was banned once again, with half of its members joining either Usta\u0161e or Partisans, and part staying loyal to Ma\u010dek who believed that the victory of Allies would bring liberal democracy into Croatia and that HSS would return to power. In May 1945, Ma\u010dek left the country, while HSS split into two fractions which boycotted the 1945 election because of their opposition to the Communists. During the period of SFR Yugoslavia (1945\u20131991), HSS was active abroad.\nOn 25 May 1991, HSS was restored under the leadership of Drago Stipac at the so-called Assembly of Unification. The party first entered Government after 2000 elections, on which it participated as part of liberal coalition (HSS-IDS-HNS-LS-SDA), with Ivica Ra\u010dan (SDP) serving as Prime Minister and its president Zlatko Tom\u010di\u0107 as Parliament Speaker. After HSS lost 2003 election, it moved to the opposition. In 2007 election, HSS formed yet another liberal coalition (HSLS-PGS-ZDS-ZS) and eventually ended up leading Ministries of Tourism and Agriculture in the Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II, and Ministries of Tourism and Regional Development in the Cabinet of Jadranka Kosor.

Millicom is headquartered in Luxembourg with a United States corporate office in Miami. Through the Tigo and Tigo Business brands, Millicom provides digital services, including high-speed data, broadband, mobile, cable TV, voice and SMS, Mobile Financial Services, and business communications. Millicom operates in nine Latin American markets, including Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Paraguay.After two years of planning, the company began operations when the founders completed a $131,000 share purchase in May 1982. The firm took over paging company Meta Systems in October 1982 and then raised $9 million in its first round of financing, managed by chief executive officer, Orhan Sadik-Khan and Kevin Kimberlin. Since 92% of the world population had no phone service at the time, Millicom promoted mobile technology on a global basis. To do this, Millicom created joint-ventures with local and strategic partners. On 13 December 1982, a joint-venture with Racal Electronics was awarded a cellular license for the United Kingdom. To enable Millicom to earn its 10% royalty from Racal-Millicom, a controlling shareholder, Stenbeck commissioned a startup with three employees, Technophone, to develop the world's first pocket-sized mobile phone. Highlighting its plans to offer the Voice and Data phone (predecessor to the smartphone), his Racal-Millicom joint-venture was renamed Vodafone.On 12 October 1983, Millicom Inc. created China Telecom Systems (HK), a joint-venture with partners China Resources Ltd. and Comvik, a Swedish mobile firm also controlled by Jan Stenbeck. China Telecom Systems (HK) held the first cellular telephone contract in China, making its service available to the public on 20 May 1985. In December 1989, Millicom set up Microtel Communications Ltd. by teaming up with Pacific Telesis and British Aerospace (later bought out by Hutchison Telecom.) Microtel was awarded a personal communication network (PCN) license to compete with Vodafone in the United Kingdom, a service launched on 28 April 1994 under its brand name, Orange. This venture was acquired in October 1999, at which time Orange and its new parent, Mannesmann, were in turn both taken over by Vodafone. At a value of $202 billion, the takeover of Mannesmann by Vodafone was the largest transaction in corporate history. Orange (formerly Microtel) was then sold to France Telecom, which subsequently changed its corporate name to Orange.To better manage their respective mobile interests, Millicom Inc. combined with Comvik's international cellular operations to become Millicom International Cellular SA in 1990, which now operates under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. In 2000, Millicom started investing in three continents: Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In 2004, Millicom conceptualized the TIGO brand. In 2008, Millicom acquired AMNET for fixed Internet and TV services, leading to the company's formal cable business entrance. Millicom completed the sale of its Asian business segment in 2011 with the sale of Laos. It previously operated in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. With the sale of its last remaining Asian operation, Millicom shifted its focus to Latin America and Africa.\nMillicom launched its first 4G high-speed internet services in Colombia in 2014, followed by Bolivia later in the year, and the remaining markets soon after. In 2014, Millicom launched the TIGO Sports Television channel in Paraguay and Bolivia.In 2012, Millicom partnered with UNICEF to protect children's rights, later renewing the partnership in 2020 to cover child online protection, and as virtual education gained prominence during the COVID-19 global pandemic.  In 2016, Millicom partnered with Microsoft to provide cloud services to its Tigo Business customers in eight markets in Latin America. In 2017, Millicom launched TIGO ONEtv, the first Next Generation TV (NGTV) service for LATAM customers, integrating traditional linear television content with over-the-top platforms, as well as video on-demand. In 2018, Millicom acquired Cable Onda in Panama.  In 2019, Millicom expanded its Latin American presence, acquiring subsidiaries of Telef\u00f3nica in Central America (Panama and Nicaragua). In addition, in 2019, Millicom common shares started trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market in the United States under the symbol TIGO. The new listing complemented the company's existing Swedish Depository Receipt (SDR) listing on NASDAQ Stockholm.In October 2020, Millicom became the first mobile operator in Latin America to introduce Amazon Prime Video Mobile Edition.In April 2021, Millicom partnered with Amazon Web Services to expand and integrate its managed and professional services into its cloud services portfolio in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia.That same month, Millicom announced the sale of its operations in Tanzania and for its stake in the AirtelTigo joint venture in Ghana, completing its multi-year plan to divest its African operations and focus on its Latin American markets.In 2023, Apollo Global Management and Marcelo Claure held discussions with Millicom regarding a potential acquisition of all outstanding shares of the company. The discussions have been terminated on June 16, 2023.At the same time, French billionaire Xavier Niel built a 25.02% stake in Millicom through his company Atlas Investissement, making him the company's main shareholder.

It claims a total original oil in place (OOIP) amount of 2 billion barrels (320,000,000 m3), and another 1 billion barrels (160,000,000 m3) in oil sands.  Future plans include drilling approximately 1,000 new oil and gas wells on about 880,000 acres (3,600 km2) of land which has previously not been developed for oil and gas production.Harvest Energy Trust was formed in July, 2002.  In 2006 it purchased the 115,000 bbl/d (18,300 m3/d) North Atlantic Refinery in Come By Chance, Newfoundland and Labrador from Vitol Refining Group, B.V., and in so doing became the first Canadian energy trust to own its own refinery.  Harvest had 924 employees and a market capitalization of US$3.22 billion at the end of 2007.  On 22 December 2009, Harvest closed its Plan of Arrangement with the Korea National Oil Corporation, which offered C$10.00 per unit through its Canadian subsidiary, KNOC Canada Ltd.  Unitholders received cash payouts in late December, with non-Canadian holders receiving payouts based on the exchange rate as of the date of closing.The Harvest Energy Trust paid a high dividend, for example yielding an annual rate of 16.0% in early 2008; it also paid out monthly, a relative rarity for equities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Its dividend payments were not taxed at the regular dividend rate, but rather at a 15% \"Qualified Dividends\" rate; this is an additional tax advantage in the United States, and applies to many royalty trusts.", "hasanswer": true}]}

(stylized as SiliconGraphics before 1999, later rebranded SGI, historically known as Silicon Graphics Computer Systems or SGCS) was an American high-performance computing manufacturer, producing computer hardware and software. Founded in Mountain View, California in November 1981 by James Clark, its initial market was 3D graphics computer workstations, but its products, strategies and market positions developed significantly over time.\nEarly systems were based on the Geometry Engine that Clark and Marc Hannah had developed at Stanford University, and were derived from Clark's broader background in computer graphics. The Geometry Engine was the first very-large-scale integration (VLSI) implementation of a geometry pipeline, specialized hardware that accelerated the \"inner-loop\" geometric computations needed to display three-dimensional images. For much of its history, the company focused on 3D imaging and was a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market.\nSilicon Graphics reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 1990. Through the mid to late-1990s, the rapidly improving performance of commodity Wintel machines began to erode SGI's stronghold in the 3D market. The porting of Maya to other platforms was a major event in this process.

It was acquired by Dolby Laboratories, Inc. in April 2007 for US$28 million.The chief executive officer of BrightSide Technologies Inc. was Richard MacKellar. The   chief technology officer was Helge Seetzen, who went on to join Dolby as becoming director of HDR Technology at Dolby (2008 to 2010), before going on to found TandemLaunch, a Montreal-based technology incubator.\nThe main electronic display technology developed by BrightSide was based on IMLED-LCD which consisted of a LCD with an array of individually modulated LED semiconductors as the backlights, instead of cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) that diffuse light in a layer of plastic. Each LED has 256 brightness steps, where step 0 switches the LED off and step 255 switches it to maximum luminance. As a result, the device can display true black and very bright white, with a contrast ratio technically of infinity, where minimal luminance is 0 cd/m2 (the denominator) and maximal luminance is almost 4,000 cd/m2. To address the confusion that may accompany a display with a quoted contrast ratio of infinity, Brightside calculates its quoted contrast ratio using the next-darkest level available on the display to arrive at a contrast ratio of 200,000:1.\nBrightSide produced a prototype display to showcase their technology: the DR37-P. Targeted industries include the medical field, CAD, film post-production, geophysical data and satellite imaging.\nOn April 25, 2007 Dolby Laboratories, Inc. announced that it completed the acquisition of Brightside Technologies.

Although theoretically both companies are of the same importance in the consortium, Gredelj produces only 13% of the worth of the tram, producing only bodies for the vehicle, and Kon\u010dar made general projects for the tram, electrics, electronics, and final assembly. Initially, \u0110uro \u0110akovi\u0107 factory was also the part of the consortium, but they have eventually left it soon after the project started, and the development and production of hydraulics and bogie mechanics was transferred to German companies SAMES Hydro-Systemtechnik GmbH & Co. KG and Henschel Antriebstechnik GmbH.", "hasanswer": true}]}
