Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from dance music, including trip hop, electronica, and rock. Lyrically, the album focuses on Minogue's self-discovery after a series of trips worldwide and delves into freedom of expression, relationships, and emotions.\nUpon its release, critical and public reception of Impossible Princess was divided over its new musical direction and Minogue's intimate lyrics. Commercially, the album reached the top 10 in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom; the British media, however, mocked its lack of success in Europe. Four singles were released from the album, including two UK top-20 entries \"Did It Again\" and \"Breathe\". Minogue embarked on the Intimate and Live tour in 1998 to support the album.\nIn retrospect, various commentators have cited Impossible Princess as Minogue's most personal and misunderstood work. Despite this, Minogue has said she would never create another studio album of personal songs like Impossible Princess.

It did, however, receive enough radio airplay to become an album favorite.\nThe artwork most commonly associated with the song is from a competition the band held for the then upcoming album The Battle of Los Angeles. Competing artists were given titles to put on their covers including \"Agunzagun\", \"Battle Hymns\", and \"The Battle of Los Angeles\". One of the titles was even a verse from \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d - \"The Riot Be the Rhyme of the Unheard\". Tom Morello eventually used the name \"Battle Hymns\" for a track on his debut album, One Man Revolution in 2007.\n\"Calm Like a Bomb\" is notable as a display of guitarist Tom Morello's creative use of a whammy pedal. Like many of RATM's songs, the song's lyrics take a radical and violent approach to the topic of social inequalities. The song also features a reference to Emiliano Zapata. Tim Commerford uses a combination of a home-made overdrive pedal and the Jim Dunlop 105Q Bass Wah pedal on his bass throughout the song. In Rolling Stone magazine's feature article on the new \"Guitar Heroes,\" a section was printed about Tom Morello, and \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d was cited as the prime example of his skill and fame on the guitar. He has occasionally referred to the extremely high whammy-pedal effects used in songs such as this as \"pterodactyl sounds.\"\n\"Calm Like a Bomb\" made its live debut on June 11, 1999, at the K-Rock Dysfunctional Family Picnic in Wantagh, New York at Jones Beach Amphitheater.\nIt was prominently featured in the ending credits of The Matrix Reloaded and was also included in the film's soundtrack.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The \"upbeat pop tune\" received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics; some reviewers thought the song felt \"flat.\"\nThe song has been covered by Taiwanese singer Amber An for her 2011 album Evil Girl, reworked in Mandarin as \u60e1\u5973.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was poorly received, despite having such notable singers as soprano Rosina Storchio, tenor Giovanni Zenatello and baritone Giuseppe De Luca in lead roles.

We Walk the Path of Endless Fire is the fifth studio album by the German death metal band Fleshcrawl.\nThis album is highly typical of Fleshcrawl's mid-to-late career material, and resembles contemporary work by such melodic/Swedish death metal bands as Dismember, Entombed, and Arch Enemy.  It utilizes highly melodic and aerobically rhythmic mid-to-high guitar range with rapid tempos and short, highly agile guitar solos, and is consequently very characteristic of the Swedish-style death metal sound that has dominated their work since the late 1990s.  A slightly brutal sound present in the drumwork, which consists of very high-tempo double bass drum rolls and the occasional blast beats, serves to accent the melodic death metal rhythmics of the album without creating a sense of disorganization and chaos, while the guttural, abrasive vocals, somewhat reminiscent of such bands as Six Feet Under and Deicide enhance the intensity of the album.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "175_379", "question": "Who performed New Order discography?", "ctxs": [{"id": "175_23381", "text": "The discography of New Order, an English rock band, consists of 10 studio albums, 12 compilation albums, six live albums, five extended plays (EPs), 45 singles, 12 video releases, 40 music videos and a number of soundtrack appearances. New Order were formed in 1980 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The group began life as a continuation of their former incarnation Joy Division. Joy Division had disbanded after the death of the lead singer Ian Curtis. Gillian Gilbert, who was Morris's girlfriend at the time, soon joined the group and played guitar and keyboards.\nRemarkably, New Order's first eight singles released between 1981 and 1984 were not taken from any album. In most cases they were not even released as a 7-inch, but exclusively available in the radio-unfriendly 12-inch format, an unusual approach for a pop-act in the eighties.\nDespite the high anticipation that surrounded the group, their debut single \"Ceremony\" only peaked at number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The group's following two singles and their debut album met with similar moderate success. It would not be until the release of their fourth single, \"Blue Monday\", that New Order would break into the top 10, with the song peaking at number 9. \"Blue Monday\" became a defining single for the group and caused a sensation, becoming the biggest selling 12-inch single of all time.New Order, like many other post-punk groups of the period, increasingly utilised keyboards, drum machine and sequencers in their music. As a result, they became associated with the synthpop and electronic dance movements of the 1980s. Beginning with Power, Corruption & Lies from 1983, all of the group's studio albums reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The group experienced a lull in popularity in the years 1985 and 1986 but the surprise international popularity of the \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" single re-launched the group across the world. The group cemented their success in 1987 with the single, \"True Faith\", and the compilation album Substance.\nNew Order were at the peak of their popularity in the years 1987 to 1993, with a run of popular singles, including \"Blue Monday 1988\", \"Fine Time\", \"Regret\", \"World (The Price of Love)\" and in 1990 they scored their only number 1 single in the UK with the official England national football team song, \"World in Motion\". The two albums released during these years, Technique and Republic; each charted at number 1 in the UK. It was during this successful period that the group's internal dynamic began to falter. Sumner was not fond of touring, and wanted to take time off from the group and produce a solo album. He formed Electronic with Johnny Marr and the pair released their first single in 1989. Hook formed his own band, Revenge, in 1989, while Morris and Gilbert worked together as The Other Two, primarily scoring soundtracks. Of the three side projects, Sumner's was by far the most successful.\nThe recording and touring of 1993's Republic, their first for London Records, was difficult and intra-band tensions were rife. The group went on hiatus until 1998. In the meantime two compilation albums, The Best of New Order and The Rest of New Order, and several singles were released.\nThe group reconvened in 1998 for the Reading Festival but did not release new material until 2000. The group released the album Get Ready in 2001. It was met with critical warmth, but it was apparent that the group's popularity had lessened. The lead single from the album, \"Crystal\", reached the top 10 in the UK. The film 24 Hour Party People, a humorous chronicle of their label Factory Records, was released in 2002. New Order contributed a new song, \"Here to Stay\", and a re-recording of the Joy Division song \"New Dawn Fades\" with Moby, for the film's soundtrack. The compilation International and four-disc boxset Retro were released in winter 2002. New Order followed Get Ready with Waiting for the Sirens' Call in 2005. During this period Gilbert stepped down from live performances due to family commitments. Phil Cunningham stepped into her role and in 2005 became an official member of the group.\nThe group had intended to release a ninth album soon after Waiting for the Sirens' Call, the majority of which had already been recorded. The lack of enthusiasm inside the group and relative failure of Waiting for the Sirens' Call stalled their career momentum. In 2007, Hook decided to leave the group, and stated that he and Sumner had no further plans to work together. Sumner formed Bad Lieutenant with Cunningham, and Hook formed Freebass. Morris continued to work with Sumner and Cunningham. In 2008, New Order released remastered and expanded editions of their first five albums with the intention of releasing the further three albums in a similar format in the future.\nLost Sirens was released in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2013.

In an interview, she related her decision to use the instrument to her interest in Indian music, comparing its sound to that of the harmonium and tambura. Her introduction to the organ also marked a turning point in her outlook as a musician; referring to the fact that the instrument has \"two or three manuals and complete bass in the pedals,\" she recalled: \"when I began to play the organ, there came the freedom and understanding that I would never have to depend on anyone else musically.\"In 2011, Impulse! reissued the album, along with Lord of Lords, as part of a compilation titled Universal Consciousness/Lord of Lords.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It has been described as the blender between 1997's Hearts Once Nourished with Hope and Compassion and 2003's That Within Blood Ill-Tempered, by Shai Hulud's guitarist, Matt Fox:\n\nThe sound.. it's hard for me to answer it accurately, it would be better to ask somebody who is listening to it. If you ask me, when I listen to 'Hearts Once Nourished..' our first album, I think it's very rhythm based. It's very very melodic, but it's definitely more rhythm based. When you listen to 'That Within Blood Ill-Tempered', it's clearly more melody based... so a lot of my friends said: 'If you guys could combine the drive, the rock, and the aggression of \"Hearts\" and the structuring, the melody and the intelligence of \"That Within Blood Ill Tempered\", you might have my favorite album of all time.' So again, because I can never answer a question just directly, to answer your question directly, what we try to do is combine both albums. We wanted to make it smart, and heavy, we wanna make it sound great. We wanted to give something to people where they could groove along to it and rock for more than a second and a half without changing, but we also wanted to maintain some technical intelligent aspect, and the melodic nature of our last album. So if you take both those albums, throw them in a blender, I think you might have something that resembles 'Misanthrophy Pure'.\n\"It's faster, slower, more metal, less metal, more rock, more progressive, and less progressive than anything we've ever done. It's like that movie 'Deep Blue Sea'. The tagline on the DVD box is 'Bigger. Faster. Smarter. Meaner.' That's how this record is. Is it the best thing we've ever done? I don't know.
