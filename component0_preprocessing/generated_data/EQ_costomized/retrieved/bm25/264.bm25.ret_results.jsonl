Though their debut single \"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\" (1965), was of a similar vein, it was \"Good Lovin'\" that established what would be categorized as the Young Rascals musical style; a mix of garage rock and rhythm and blues that was personalized by Felix Cavaliere's blue-eyed soul vocals. The two singles following \"Good Lovin'\", \"You Better Run\" and \"Come On Up\" (both 1966) expanded upon this musical venture, the latter of which featured a \"more aggressive sound\" through Gene Cornish's fuzz guitar licks. Despite this, both singles were relative chart failures, reaching number 20 and 43 on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively.Starting with \"You Better Run\", the Young Rascals singer Eddie Brigati and Cavaliere formed a songwriting partnership, where Brigati provided most of the lyrics while Cavaliere composed the music. Additionally, by early 1967 the Young Rascals attempted to move away from their initial rhythm and blues sound, expanding on it. Their January 1967 single \"I've Been Lonely Too Long\" abandoned Cavaliere's organ in favor of a more piano-based sound; this moved the band back into the Billboard top 20. Despite this, the band found the charting to be a commercial failure, having aimed for the single to become a top-ten hit, leading to the members wanting to revamp the group's image. Around the same time, Cornish would state that their follow-up single would be completely different, lacking organ, guitars or drums; instead basing their sound on conga drums, harmonica and sound effect of birds.\"Groovin'\" was inspired by Cavaliere's then-girlfriend, Adrienne Buccheri, who according to him caused emotions that were \"tailor-made to that style of music\". In a later interview, Cavaliere stated that he believed Buccheri to be \"divinely sent for the purpose of inspiring my creativity\". The day of Sunday proved to be an additional general inspiration for Cavaliere in conceiving the song, as that was the sole day that he had a chance to spend time with Buccheri. Cavaliere states that \"Groovin'\" was a reflection of \"the bliss I felt relaxing with her on Sunday afternoons, watching the world go by\".The musical content of \"Groovin'\" was largely derived from the time Cavaliere spent working at mountain resorts in Upstate New York, where he was introduced to Latin rhythms, something that compelled him. The song was composed at an upright piano in the shared apartment of Brigati and Cavaliere, before the duo collaborated on the lyrics. Brigati was tasked with writing the lyrics of \"Groovin'\" by Cavaliere because \"he [Cavaliere] felt he [Brigati] was better at expressing Cavaliere's ideas\". The lyrical ideas were initially conveyed by Cavaliere humming a tune, to which Brigati would attempt to write lyrics to fit them, before Cavaliere would re-arrange the lyrics to his preferred liking. With \"Groovin'\", however, Cavaliere did not make adjustment's to Brigati's lyrics since \"that was the way it was\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The label, which is actually the second incarnation (the first Universal Records was a short-lived underground imprint of MCA Records that existed from 1988 to 1989) was created by former Universal Music Group chairman and CEO Doug Morris and Daniel Glass (founder of Glassnote Records), who became its president.\nIn 1996, to complement the MCA renaming into Universal, MCA Music Entertainment Group was also rebranded into what is known today as Universal Music Group. With that in place, Universal Records was to operate under the newly renamed UMG banner.Universal Records had success in breaking new artists, including the multi-platinum debut of Erykah Badu, Billie Myers, Goldfinger, Akon and the Lost Boyz. Glass formed relationships with independent record labels such as Kedar Entertainment and Mojo Records. Universal also brought in and took over Uptown Records following founder Andre Harrell's departure. Following Heavy D's dropping from the imprint in 1997, Universal folded Uptown in 1999.New Orleans, Louisiana based record company Cash Money Records, led by Ronald \"Slim\" Williams and Bryan \"Baby/Birdman\" Williams, signed a three-year $30 million distribution deal with Universal Records in March 1998. Under the terms of the deal, the Williams were given a $3 million advance each year and a credit of $1.5 million for each of the up to six artists that they had at the time. After recouping, Universal Records would retain 15% of profits from album sales, while Cash Money retained 85% as well as ownership of all master recordings. Cash Money's first success under Universal was Juvenile's November 1998 release, 400 Degreez. The album peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 and would ultimately go on to be certified quadruple platinum in the United States. Cash Money and Universal also launched Lil Wayne's career with his November 1999 album Tha Block Is Hot, which was a top three Billboard 200 album and later certified platinum in America.On December 10, 1998, Seagram completed its seven-month $10.6 billion plan to acquire PolyGram, merging its music division of labels with UMG, helping both divisions combine operations together under the biggest music recording company. On New Year's Eve 1998, Universal Records was pooled together with then-PolyGram label Motown Records and fellow MCA label Republic Records to form Universal Motown Republic Group; Motown was previously brought under UMG during its preceding days as MCA Inc. It was a subsidiary of MCA Records and was minority-owned by Boston Ventures until 1991. To start the New Year in 1999, Universal Motown Republic Group became one of the three new music units under UMG alongside Interscope Geffen A&M Records and The Island Def Jam Music Group.In 2001, after the absorption of Priority Records into EMI, No Limit Records was signed a distribution deal with Universal and renamed \"The New No Limit\". However, this deal failed as various releases by Master P, Romeo, 504 Boyz and Choppa did not meet commercial expectations. No Limit cut ties with Universal in 2004, a year after filing for bankruptcy.Bad Boy Entertainment, founded by Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs, signed a three-year marketing and distribution deal with Universal Records in February 2003, following its departure from Arista Records. Universal and Bad Boy released Da Band's September 2003 album, Too Hot for TV. The album was ultimately certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Albums under this deal that followed include the soundtrack to Bad Boys II, Loon's self-titled album, Carl Thomas' Let's Talk About It, Mario Winans' Hurt No More and New Edition's One Love. In 2005, Bad Boy switched distribution from Universal to Atlantic Records before the deal could be fulfilled.The label later had more success with acts like 3 Doors Down, 98 Degrees, Chamillionaire, Godsmack, Mushroomhead, Flaw, Hatebreed, Lifer, Jack Johnson, Juvenile, Nelly, Big Sha, Lil Wayne, and Mika. In the summer of 2004, Universal had a big success with Terror Squad's single, \"Lean Back\", which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 that August.By 2005, Universal was reaching its downfall, even though Cash Money kept its prophecy leading, but its success was short-lived. On New Year's Eve 2005, Universal Records was merged with Republic Records to become Universal Republic Records. Motown (as a standalone label) was renamed Universal Motown Records. Therefore, artists under Motown, as well as hip hop and R&B acts under Universal were combined together under Universal Motown, with the rest being transferred to Universal Republic, which would later be reverted back to Republic Records in 2012, a year after Universal Motown was changed back to Motown, which itself would be moved to Island Def Jam. As a result, the Universal Motown Republic Group was disbanded in the summer of 2011 during a reorganization at Universal Music Group, which was under the leadership of Lucian Grainge.It was also the distributor of Polydor and Island UK in the United States. Distribution switched to Interscope Geffen A&M Records and Republic Records respectively after the label's dissolution. Island's operation in the United Kingdom, in 2013, would be absorbed into Virgin EMI Records would itself would be rebranded in 2020 as EMI Records, taking over distribution for Republic UK.\nAs of December 2023, Universal Records is currently inactive as its artists would later be drafted to Republic Records. Motown is currently under the Capitol Music Group, which it has been a part of since 2014 following another UMG disbandment of the Island Def Jam Music Group. Therefore, reissues of releases under the Universal Records, Universal Republic or Universal Motown names will be handled by Republic and Motown respectively on behalf of Universal Music Enterprises.\nThere have been unrelated Universal Records labels in Europe and the Philippines. Because of an unrelated label in the Philippines owning the rights to the Universal Records name in that country, parent company Universal Music Group did business there as MCA Music, Inc., using UMG's former name.

This connection quickly fascinated American and International Media, which led to much being written about this unique example of life-imitating-art, and many international tours with the author. Many fans of this phenomenon felt that this was a necessary complicating counter-narrative to a simplistic and largely Islamophobic post-9/11 American media landscape.\nThey came to renown in South Asia from songs they released in Punjabi, Urdu, and Hindi. Their filmed BBC session where the band covered Bollywood classic \"Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai\" especially got the band much positive attention from the Southern Asian and Punjabi peoples, both native and abroad.\nOne of their biggest hits is the song \"Tunnnnnn\", which is a re-interpretation of a classic reggae song; Willie Williams' \"Armagideon Time\". The lyrics of \"Tunnnnnn\" are a mashup of English, Urdu, and Punjabi. Its lyrics proclaim (in Urdu): \"We will only drink what they drink in Iraq! We will only drink what they drink in Karbala!\", touching upon the subject of the horrific reality of warfare and the bombs which were dropped on those places. \"Tunnnnnn\" was an instant hit with both Kominas fans and newcomers alike.\nWith the self-titled release \"Kominas\" in 2012, the band has adopted the more Americana rock elements grunge and garage rock in their style and moved away from writing about Muslim-centric issues.  From 2009\u20132012 the band toured extensively around America, Canada, and Europe.

It is music that can, and should, be heard repeatedly, not only for the variations that Mr. Cherry develops from performance to performance, but also for the rich lode of lyrical beauty and rhythmic stimulation with which he has filled it.\"Writing for The Free Jazz Collective, Stef Gijssels noted that, with Relativity Suite, \"Instrumental perfection and precision were not [Cherry's] primary focus, but rather the creation of a sonic universe that was new, global, inclusive with the ambition to create something universal and spiritual, not imposed out of some cerebral and abstract concept, but grown organically from the already existing sounds of many cultures.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

On the subject of joining the band in 1989, Steve Hogarth said in a 2001 interview: \"At about the same time, Matt Johnson of The The asked me to play piano on his tour. I always say I had to make a choice between the most hip band in the world, and the least.\" In the same conversation, he said: \"We're just tired of the opinions of people who haven't heard anything we've done in ten years. A lot of what's spread about this band is laughable.\"Much of the band's enduring and unfashionable reputation stems from their emergence in the early 1980s as the most commercially successful band of the neo-prog movement, an unexpected revival of the progressive rock musical style that had fallen out of critical favour in the mid-1970s. Some early critics were quick to dismiss the band as clones of Peter Gabriel-era Genesis due to musical similarities, such as their extended songs, a prominent and Mellotron-influenced keyboard sound, vivid and fantastical lyrics and the equally vivid and fantastical artwork by Mark Wilkinson used for the sleeves of their albums and singles.  Lead singer Fish was also often compared with Gabriel due to his early vocal style and theatrical stage performances, which in the early years included wearing face paint.\n\nAs Jon Wilde summarised in Melody Maker in 1989: At the end of a strange year for pop music, Marillion appeared in November 1982 with \"Market Square Heroes\". There were many strange things about 1982, but Marillion were the strangest of them all. For six years, they stood out of time. Marillion were the unhippest group going.  As punk was becoming a distant echo, they appeared with a sound and an attitude that gazed back longingly to the age of Seventies pomp.  When compared to Yes, Genesis and ELP, they would take it as a compliment. The Eighties have seen some odd phenomena. But none quite as odd as Marillion. Along the way, as if by glorious fluke, they turned out some singles that everybody quietly liked \u2013 \"Garden Party\", \"Punch and Judy\" and \"Incommunicado\". By this time, Marillion did not need the support of the hip-conscious. They were massive. Perhaps the oddest thing about Marillion was that they became one of the biggest groups of the decade. They might have been an anomaly but they were monstrously effective.\nThe band's unfashionable reputation and image has often been mentioned in the media, even in otherwise positive reviews. In Q in 1987, David Hepworth wrote: \"Marillion may represent the inelegant, unglamorous, public bar end of the current Rock Renaissance but they are no less part of it for that. Clutching at Straws suggests that they may be finally coming in from the cold.\" In the same magazine in 1995, Dave Henderson wrote: \"It's not yet possible to be sacked for showing an affinity for Marillion, but has there ever been a band with a larger stigma attached?\" He also argued that if the album Afraid of Sunlight \"had been made by a new, no baggage-of-the-past combo, it would be greeted with open arms, hailed as virtual genius.\" In Record Collector in 2002, Tim Jones argued they were \"one of the most unfairly berated bands in Britain\" and \"one of its best live rock acts.\" In 2004, Classic Rock's Jon Hotten wrote: \"That genre thing has been a bugbear of Marillion's, but it no longer seems relevant. What are Radiohead if not a progressive band?\" and said Marillion were \"making strong, singular music with the courage of their convictions, and we should treasure them more than we do.\" In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, an article on Marillion written by Mick Wall described them as \"probably the most misunderstood band in the world\".\nIn 2007, Stephen Dalton of The Times stated: The band have just released their 14th album, Somewhere Else, which is really rather good. Containing tracks that shimmer like Coldplay, ache like Radiohead and thunder like Muse, it is better than 80 per cent of this month's releases. But you are unlikely to hear Marillion on British radio, read about them in the music press or see them play a major festival. This is largely because Marillion have \u2013 how can we put this kindly? \u2013 an image problem. Their music is still perceived as bloated, bombastic mullet-haired prog-rock, even by people who have never heard it. In fairness, they did once release an album called Script for a Jester's Tear. But, come on, we all had bad hair days in the 1980s.\nDespite publishing a very good review for their 1995 album Afraid of Sunlight and including it in their 50 Best Albums of 1995, Q refused to interview the band or write a feature on them. Steve Hogarth later said: \"How can they say, this is an amazing record... no, we don't want to talk to you? It's hard to take when they say, here's a very average record... we'll put you on the front cover.\"In 2001, the television critic of The Guardian, Gareth McLean, used his review of the Michael Lewis BBC Two documentary, Next: The Future Just Happened, to concentrate on launching a scathing attack on the band, whose appearance only constituted one segment of the programme. He described them as \"once dodgy and now completely rubbish\" and he characterised their fans as \"slightly simple folks\". He also dismissed the band's efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: \"One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion.\"Rachel Cooke, a writer for The Observer and New Statesman, has repeatedly referred negatively to the band and insulted their fans in her articles.\nIn an interview in 2000, Hogarth expressed regret about the band retaining their name after he joined: If we had known when I joined Marillion what we know now, we'd have changed the name and been a new band. It was a mistake to keep the name, because what it represented in the mid-Eighties is a millstone we now carry. If we'd changed it, I think we would have been better off. We would have been judged for our music. It's such a grave injustice that the media constantly calls us a 'dinosaur prog band'. They only say that out of ignorance because they haven't listened to anything we've done for the last 15 bloody years. If you hear anything we've done in the last five or six years, that description is totally irrelevant... It's a massive frustration that no-one will play our stuff. If we send our single to Radio 1 they say: 'Sorry, we don't play music by bands who are over so-many years old... and here's the new U2 single.' I suppose it's something everyone has to cope with \u2013 every band are remembered for their big hit single, irrespective of how much they change over the years. But you can only transcend that by continuing to have hits. It's Catch 22. You know, at some stage, someone has to notice that we're doing interesting things. Someday someone will take a retrospective look at us and be surprised.\nThe 2013 film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa includes a joke reference to a former drummer of the band. The band were quoted: \"We know Marillion are seen as 'uncool' but we were delighted to be a part of it.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "264_60", "question": "What music label is The Gladiators represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_52513", "text": "Albert Griffiths, singer and guitar player, was the founder of the reggae group The Gladiators. After some success with the singles \"You Are The Girl\" (a b-side to The Ethiopians' hit record \"Train to Skaville\") in 1966, he recruited his childhood friends David Webber and Errol Grandison in 1968 to form the original Gladiators vocal group. The group's name was allegedly suggested by a fellow bus passenger during the time of their first recordings.The group's first major success was with the single \"Hello Carol\" in 1968, for producer Coxsone Dodd, which topped the Jamaican music charts.  Shortly afterwards, in 1969, Webber was stricken with illness and was replaced by Clinton Fearon, one of Griffiths' proteges.  Similarly Grandison left the group in 1973 for family commitments and was replaced by Gallimore Sutherland.During the early 1970s the Gladiators cut numerous records for various producers such as, Lloyd Daley and Lee Perry, but it was their recordings for Dodd at Studio One that became the biggest hits.  During this time at Studio One the Gladiators' hits included \"Bongo Red\", \"Jah Jah Go Before Us\", \"Mr. Baldwin\", and \"Roots Natty\".The success of these recordings garnered the attention of Britain-based Virgin Records, who gave the group their first major recording contract in 1976.  Their debut album released on Virgin was the Tony Robinson produced Trenchtown Mix Up (1976), which included revisions of many of their early hits.  They followed this effort with Proverbial Reggae (1978). At the time Gladiators was a band with Albert Griffiths on lead guitar and vocals, Clinton Fearon on bass guitar and vocals, Gallimore Sutherland on rhythm guitar and vocals, Sly Dunbar on drums, Lloyd Parks on bass, Uziah \"Sticky\" Thompson on percussion, Ansel Collins on keyboards and Earl 'Wire' Lindo on synthesizer. Errol Thompson and Joe Gibbs were their engineer and mixer, and Robinson the record producer.\nDodd and Studio One also released Studio One Presenting the Gladiators, (1978) a compilation of some early Gladiators' records released 1968 \u2013 1974. The Gladiators' next two albums on Virgin were Naturality (1978) and Sweet So Till (1979). The group's next album Gladiators was recorded at Coach House Studios in the UK with local producer Eddy Grant.  It was the first Gladiators' album on which no member of the group played any of the instruments, as a few members of the band Aswad were brought in.  The album did worse than their previous work, and they were subsequently dropped from their contract with Virgin.  Virgin subsequently released two compilation albums Vital Selection in 1981 and Dreadlocks The Time Is Now in 1983.At the time, roots reggae was declining. A new type of reggae \u2013 based on drum machine, sampler, synthesizers and organ \u2013 occurred in the 1980s; ragga. One of the reasons for ragga's swift propagation is that it is generally easier, and less expensive to produce, than reggae performed on traditional musical instruments. Nevertheless, the Gladiators released eleven studio albums in the 1980s. They soon found a home at US-based Nighthawk Records and released Symbol of Reality in late 1982 followed by Serious Thing in 1984.  One year later the Gladiators changed labels again, this time moving to Heartbeat Records, where they released albums throughout the latter half of the decade.  In 1987 Fearon left the group after eighteen years, but Griffiths and Sutherland have continued to release albums on various labels since then.\nWith the advent of dancehall in the 1990s, the Gladiators only released three studio albums during that decade. Eventually, the Gladiators, Mighty Diamonds, Bunny Wailer, Heptones and Burning Spear had a renaissance. The dancehall artists had to change their profile and baptised their new showmanship as conscious dancehall.In 2005, the Gladiators released Fathers and Sons which has been regarded as Albert Griffiths' farewell after ill health forced him to retire from touring, with his sons, Alan and Anthony, joining the group.In June 2013, the group announced that their next album would be a collaboration with deejay Droop Lion, nephew of original Gladiators' member David Webber, performing new versions of some of the group's most popular tracks.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jim Farber from Daily News noted that Ricky Martin \"provides a textbook example of how to mix Latin beats with pop tunes and rock intonations\". Lucas Villa from Spin wrote about Martin's global success in 1999: \"When the world went loca for Ricky, he led the way for other Latin music superstars like Spain's Enrique Iglesias, Colombia's Shakira and Nuyoricans like Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony to make their marks beyond the Spanish-speaking crowds.\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch critic Kevin C. Johnson described Martin as Latin music's \"pretty-faced poster boy\" who is \"taking the music to places Jon Secada, Selena and Santana never could\". He also mentioned that even \"Gloria Estefan at her peak, failed to muster up the kind of hype and hoopla surrounding Martin\".\n\nCelia San Miguel of Tidal Magazine stated that Martin \"highlighted the public's thirst for a different kind of pop\" in 1999, noting the album's \"fusion-heavy\" and \"hip-shaking rhythms associated with Latin music\".

It was also a significant growth in compare with 1998. The website highlighted ...Baby One More Time, Ricky Martin, and Millennium as examples of \"blockbuster albums\" which produced the result. Also, Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield described 1999 as \"the year music exploded\", mentioning Spears, Aguilera, Martin, NSYNC, and the Backstreet Boys as \"a new breed of stars\" who got born.

{"id": "264_78", "question": "What music label is Irreplaceable represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_52586", "text": "\"Irreplaceable\" was written for Chrisette Michele. Production team Stargate and singer-songwriter Ne-Yo had written for Beyonc\u00e9's second album B'Day, but Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate said that they might not have gone in the direction they did on the song. The tune did not suit Beyonc\u00e9's voice, and Ne-Yo wrote the lyrics from a male perspective, although it was not based upon his personal experiences. Ne-Yo wrote the song in the country style, thinking of country singers Shania Twain and Faith Hill during the sessions. When Ne-Yo heard them playing the song with a guitar, he thought it sounded like country music. But when the drums were incorporated into the music, it was brought to an R&B vibe, and Ne-Yo considered making an R&B-country western music song instead.When the team worked with Ne-Yo, they recorded the song with a male vocalist. However, they thought a female vocalist would be more suitable, and Ne-Yo also thought that it was empowering for a woman to sing it. Eriksen of Stargate said it was an A&R person who suggested that the song would work better when sung by a woman. Two labels wanted the song. While Beyonc\u00e9 worked on material for B'Day, she was pleased with the demo of the \"Irreplaceable\" that was presented to her. However, \"Irreplaceable\" did not seem to fit on B'Day, which was supposed to be \"a hard-hitting club album\". Swizz Beatz, who was working on the album, declared that Beyonc\u00e9 would be crazy not to include the song on the record. Beyonc\u00e9 asked for changes to the song, including the addition of drums, vocal arrangements, and singing in a higher register than the demo. Espen Lind and Amund Bj\u00f8rklund, from the Norwegian production team Espionage, wrote the chord structure and the guitar part. In an interview with MTV, Ne-Yo said, \"Beyonc\u00e9 had some stuff that she wanted to get off her chest\", while aiming to make a record that women could relate to, in keeping with the theme of the album.\nThe recording was engineered by Jim Caruana and mixed by Jason Goldstein at Sony Music Studios in New York City. Goldstein was hired to mix B'Day. He said: \"This song was really simple to mix. It was produced by Stargate and the sounds are really good and they all made sense, and there was lots of room for all the instruments.\" Goldstein used a board equalizer for the drums' treatment. For the acoustic guitars, he used the analogue flanger of a TC 1210 spatial expander \"to sweeten the sound\" and to give them \"a little bit more spread\". Goldstein thought \"Irreplaceable\" sounded \"a bit old-school\"; an eighth note delay echo was placed on the song's lead vocal at 341ms, using the Echo Farm plug-in software. For the backing vocals, Goldstein used Echo Farm with a quarter note delay at 682ms and Sony's Oxford Dynamics compressor/limiter in dual-mono mode.The compressor was placed in Classic setting, to emulate the LA-2A leveling amplifier, and the Warmth button used to add harmonics. Oxford Dynamics was used for the bass in a different setting. Goldstein passed the final mix through the Oxford EQ and Inflator plug-ins. Pro Tools software was used to print the aux track into a 44.1kHz/24-bit CD and then into a 24-bit CD master. After the sessions for \"Irreplaceable\" ended, Hermansen said that \"everyone felt they had captured something special and that Beyonc\u00e9 had done the track justice\", but there were still concerns that urban radio might not play the song as it featured acoustic guitars and had more of a pop appeal. \"But then it became the biggest urban record ... ever,\" [Hermansen] said.", "hasanswer": false}]}

I suppose I had a secret desire to sing.\" They soon teamed up with bass guitarist Alex Keyser and drummer Andy Henderson, who had previously played with PJ Harvey's band. Guitarist Debbie Smith, formerly of Curve, came on board in 1994. According to the Epic Records' website, the group came up with the name Echobelly from the notion of \"being hungry for something\". With Madan and Johansson as the band's songwriters, they recorded their debut EP, Bellyache, on the independent Pandemonium label in late 1993.The favourable response to Bellyache helped Echobelly secure a recording contract with Rhythm King, which was then part of Epic. Once on board the label, the group released the \"I Can't Imagine the World Without Me\" single in June 1994. The group then recorded the album Everyone's Got One, which included the single \"Insomniac\" and reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart. The single was featured in the film and soundtrack of Dumb and Dumber.\nAs their music received more airplay, Echobelly won admiration from other artists as well. Madonna expressed interest in putting them on her Maverick label (existing contractual arrangements prevented that), and R.E.M. requested the group as the opening act for their upcoming tour. The band returned to the studio in 1995 to create their next album, On, produced by Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie, who had also produced Hole and Radiohead.\nMadan's lyrics often ventured into the less explored side of life, addressed in songs such as \"King of the Kerb\". and \"Dark Therapy\". \"I wanted to challenge myself as a lyricist on a different level on this album,\" Madan said in Rolling Stone. \"I want people to tell me what they thought the lyrics are about. I'm not a politician. I'm not interested in changing everybody around me. I'm interested in myself.\"\nWhile many of the songs lamented the state of things, others on the On album celebrated the endless possibilities of the human spirit. In \"Great Things\", Madan sang \"I want to do great things / I don't want to compromise / I want to know what love is / I want to know everything.\" The album's mostly optimistic feel provides an intriguing contrast with its serious subject matter. As Pareles wrote, \"Both music and lyrics examine the tension between order and liberty\". Listeners in the UK responded favourably to the album, driving three singles from the release into the Top 30 of the UK Singles Chart. Sales of the album rose to over 150,000 in the UK, nearly double that of Everyone's Got One.\nHealth and legal problems interrupted the success of Echobelly in 1995 and 1996. Madan had a serious thyroid problem during her world tour that was potentially life-threatening, but was later cured. Bass guitarist James Harris joined after Keyser defected because of personal and artistic differences. The group also had disagreements with Rhythm King after the label moved to Arista. The band chose to stay with Epic. In 1996, Madan also ventured away from the group when she sang on a recording of the club band, Lithium. Smith left the band before the release of the band's third album Lustra, which was produced by Gil Norton and issued in November 1997. A single from the album, \"The World is Flat\", was released in August of that year.A four-year hiatus was brought to an end in 2001 when the band returned with the Digit EP and their fourth album, People Are Expensive (produced by Ben Hillier), which were released on their own Fry Up label. Two further singles, \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Kali Yuga\" (a remixed version of the album track) followed.\nIn 2004, Echobelly released a fifth album, again through their own Fry Up label, Gravity Pulls (produced by Ian Grimble).", "hasanswer": false}]}

At the time, Fat Wreck Chords had a specific pop punk sound, so the band members wanted to find a producer who could help distinguish them from the other bands on the label, and highlight the heavier aspects of their music. Sonic Iguana Studios, where Rise Against recorded The Unraveling, and another studio in San Francisco were both busy at the time, leaving the band members only thirty days to record. They decided on Bill Stevenson\u2014the former drummer of the punk band Descendents\u2014and Jason Livermore to produce the album.Before the recording process began, the band members wrote songs for the album above an antique store in Chicago, an environment that McIlrath described as \"roach-infested\". Revolutions per Minute was recorded at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, from November to December 2002. Stevenson and Livermore produced the album; Stevenson also served as the engineer and mixer, while Livermore mastered the album. McIlrath commented that Stevenson was the perfect person to produce the album, as he not only understood the nuances of the band, but was also their \"musical soul mate\".

Recorded at the Brill Building, Glasgow over two days by Richie Dempsey, Rebuild The Pier was critically acclaimed by national press and has retrospectively been regarded as a pioneering, landmark record by many bands and individuals. The 2001 follow up, 'On The Enjoyment of Unpleasant Places', achieved a similar status on its release through the legendary English label Subjugation Records. Initial pressings of the record sold very quickly and, indeed, it remained out of print until a repackaged version (including the Icy You EP) was released in 2004. 2002 saw the release of two EPs by Stapleton; firstly, the 'Icy You' EP, made up of songs from the 'On The Enjoyment' sessions, and secondly, the 'Chez Chef' EP, recorded in London by Pat Collier and Larry Hibbitt. Stapleton toured prolifically around this time, supporting high-profile peers such as Idlewild, Snow Patrol and Hundred Reasons, as well as highly regarded independent touring bands like Lungfish, Weakerthans, Q and not U, Pedro The Lion, Tristeza and Burning Airlines.

The instrumental trio created an amalgam of tight-knit compositions encompassing progressive rock, metal, jazz, ambient and classical stylings, often within the boundaries of each composition. The result was critically acclaimed and continues to grow a following as word of mouth of the project expands.\nFor Acts of God, the second release from the At War With Self project (2007), Snelwar has desired to create a set of compositions with the intentions of living up to the label 'progressive' by dramatically changing almost every facet of the project while staying true to the underlying inspiration of the project's inception - to combine disparate styles and create music with no boundaries. No better choice than Damon Trotta as a co-writer and bassist to create what is sure to be as intriguing a release as Torn Between Dimensions. With Trotta on bass, vocals, synths and programming and Snelwar on guitars, mandolin and synths, the duo is assisted by Sluggo's Goon Music labelmates Damon Trotta (bass, vocals), James Von Buelow (guitars), Steve Decker (drums), Mark Sunshine (vocals), Dave Archer (keyboards) and Manfred Dikkers (drums) to create some truly stunning, inspired progressive music.\nThe 2009 release A Familiar Path is the third chapter of At War With Self, which is a return to Snelwar's roots as a musician that maintains the concept of the project changing for each release. The original concept in which Snelwar combined classical guitars into progressive and thrash metal has been re-visited and fully realized with A Familiar Path. The new incarnation of At War With Self features Manfred Dikkers, who joins Snelwar again from the Acts of God sessions on drums and percussion. The tracks on A Familiar Path are \"the heaviest, most aggressive and accurate version of what I've had in mind for combining metal and progressive influences with classical guitars\" says Snelwar. Instrumental tracks such as a hybrid half-classical, half-metal rendition of a Heitor Villa-Lobos guitar study, the Slayer-meets-King Crimson aggression of Concrete and Poison and Diseased State, a new rendering of Reflections originally featured on the debut Gordian Knot disc and the guitar shred of The Ether Trail, are balanced with the vocally-centered title track and Ourselves.

On the subject of joining the band in 1989, Steve Hogarth said in a 2001 interview: \"At about the same time, Matt Johnson of The The asked me to play piano on his tour. I always say I had to make a choice between the most hip band in the world, and the least.\" In the same conversation, he said: \"We're just tired of the opinions of people who haven't heard anything we've done in ten years. A lot of what's spread about this band is laughable.\"Much of the band's enduring and unfashionable reputation stems from their emergence in the early 1980s as the most commercially successful band of the neo-prog movement, an unexpected revival of the progressive rock musical style that had fallen out of critical favour in the mid-1970s. Some early critics were quick to dismiss the band as clones of Peter Gabriel-era Genesis due to musical similarities, such as their extended songs, a prominent and Mellotron-influenced keyboard sound, vivid and fantastical lyrics and the equally vivid and fantastical artwork by Mark Wilkinson used for the sleeves of their albums and singles.  Lead singer Fish was also often compared with Gabriel due to his early vocal style and theatrical stage performances, which in the early years included wearing face paint.\n\nAs Jon Wilde summarised in Melody Maker in 1989: At the end of a strange year for pop music, Marillion appeared in November 1982 with \"Market Square Heroes\". There were many strange things about 1982, but Marillion were the strangest of them all. For six years, they stood out of time. Marillion were the unhippest group going.  As punk was becoming a distant echo, they appeared with a sound and an attitude that gazed back longingly to the age of Seventies pomp.  When compared to Yes, Genesis and ELP, they would take it as a compliment. The Eighties have seen some odd phenomena. But none quite as odd as Marillion. Along the way, as if by glorious fluke, they turned out some singles that everybody quietly liked \u2013 \"Garden Party\", \"Punch and Judy\" and \"Incommunicado\". By this time, Marillion did not need the support of the hip-conscious. They were massive. Perhaps the oddest thing about Marillion was that they became one of the biggest groups of the decade. They might have been an anomaly but they were monstrously effective.\nThe band's unfashionable reputation and image has often been mentioned in the media, even in otherwise positive reviews. In Q in 1987, David Hepworth wrote: \"Marillion may represent the inelegant, unglamorous, public bar end of the current Rock Renaissance but they are no less part of it for that. Clutching at Straws suggests that they may be finally coming in from the cold.\" In the same magazine in 1995, Dave Henderson wrote: \"It's not yet possible to be sacked for showing an affinity for Marillion, but has there ever been a band with a larger stigma attached?\" He also argued that if the album Afraid of Sunlight \"had been made by a new, no baggage-of-the-past combo, it would be greeted with open arms, hailed as virtual genius.\" In Record Collector in 2002, Tim Jones argued they were \"one of the most unfairly berated bands in Britain\" and \"one of its best live rock acts.\" In 2004, Classic Rock's Jon Hotten wrote: \"That genre thing has been a bugbear of Marillion's, but it no longer seems relevant. What are Radiohead if not a progressive band?\" and said Marillion were \"making strong, singular music with the courage of their convictions, and we should treasure them more than we do.\" In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, an article on Marillion written by Mick Wall described them as \"probably the most misunderstood band in the world\".\nIn 2007, Stephen Dalton of The Times stated: The band have just released their 14th album, Somewhere Else, which is really rather good. Containing tracks that shimmer like Coldplay, ache like Radiohead and thunder like Muse, it is better than 80 per cent of this month's releases. But you are unlikely to hear Marillion on British radio, read about them in the music press or see them play a major festival. This is largely because Marillion have \u2013 how can we put this kindly? \u2013 an image problem. Their music is still perceived as bloated, bombastic mullet-haired prog-rock, even by people who have never heard it. In fairness, they did once release an album called Script for a Jester's Tear. But, come on, we all had bad hair days in the 1980s.\nDespite publishing a very good review for their 1995 album Afraid of Sunlight and including it in their 50 Best Albums of 1995, Q refused to interview the band or write a feature on them. Steve Hogarth later said: \"How can they say, this is an amazing record... no, we don't want to talk to you? It's hard to take when they say, here's a very average record... we'll put you on the front cover.\"In 2001, the television critic of The Guardian, Gareth McLean, used his review of the Michael Lewis BBC Two documentary, Next: The Future Just Happened, to concentrate on launching a scathing attack on the band, whose appearance only constituted one segment of the programme. He described them as \"once dodgy and now completely rubbish\" and he characterised their fans as \"slightly simple folks\". He also dismissed the band's efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: \"One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion.\"Rachel Cooke, a writer for The Observer and New Statesman, has repeatedly referred negatively to the band and insulted their fans in her articles.\nIn an interview in 2000, Hogarth expressed regret about the band retaining their name after he joined: If we had known when I joined Marillion what we know now, we'd have changed the name and been a new band. It was a mistake to keep the name, because what it represented in the mid-Eighties is a millstone we now carry. If we'd changed it, I think we would have been better off. We would have been judged for our music. It's such a grave injustice that the media constantly calls us a 'dinosaur prog band'. They only say that out of ignorance because they haven't listened to anything we've done for the last 15 bloody years. If you hear anything we've done in the last five or six years, that description is totally irrelevant... It's a massive frustration that no-one will play our stuff. If we send our single to Radio 1 they say: 'Sorry, we don't play music by bands who are over so-many years old... and here's the new U2 single.' I suppose it's something everyone has to cope with \u2013 every band are remembered for their big hit single, irrespective of how much they change over the years. But you can only transcend that by continuing to have hits. It's Catch 22. You know, at some stage, someone has to notice that we're doing interesting things. Someday someone will take a retrospective look at us and be surprised.\nThe 2013 film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa includes a joke reference to a former drummer of the band. The band were quoted: \"We know Marillion are seen as 'uncool' but we were delighted to be a part of it.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although with their second album An Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity, they abandoned that sound and featured the nu metal sound they became known for, continuing on their next releases. Some critics deny that Nothingface is a nu metal band due to their use of guitar solos and absence of elements from hip-hop and other characteristics featured in nu metal. The band's sound consists of aggressive heavy metal guitar riffs, screamed vocals, and melodic singing. Singer Matt Holt's melodic and grunge-esque singing has been compared to Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and the vocals of Alice in Chains. Critics have praised Holt's singing style for being able to mix harshness with accessibility. Jennifer Slivka of the Daily Collegian, noting that Nothingface \"don't rap\" and \"don't sound like Korn\", distinguished Nothingface from the band's contemporaries: \"Their music is loud and aggressive, recalling more of the older metal bands like Pantera.

Medley formed the group with Hatfield in 1963. They had first performed together in 1962 in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called the Paramours, and adopted the name The Righteous Brothers when they became a duo. Their most active recording period was in the 1960s and '70s, and, after several years inactive as a duo, Hatfield and Medley reunited in 1981 and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003. The term \"blue-eyed soul\" is thought to have first been coined by Philadelphia radio DJ Georgie Woods in 1964 when describing the duo's music.Hatfield and Medley had contrasting vocal ranges, which helped them create a distinctive sound as a duet. They each had the vocal talent to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his bass-baritone voice, with Hatfield taking the higher-register vocals with his tenor. His voice reached the register of a countertenor.Following a year and a half of Top 40 non-entries on Billboard's Hot 100, the duo hit big with the late-1964 release of what would become their signature record, \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" \u2013 a transatlantic number one produced by Phil Spector, often considered one of his finest works and a landmark recording in popular music.

She acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\"In 1993, Australian director Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with American actress Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, she has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \"look\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected. Her progression from the wholesome \"girl next door\" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans. Her music video for \"Spinning Around\" led to some media outlets referring to her as \"SexKylie\", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos. In September 2002, she was ranked 27 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists list. She was also named one of the 100 Hottest Women of All-Time by Men's Health in 2013. William Baker described her status as a sex symbol as a \"double edged sword\", observing \"we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record. But now it has become in danger of eclipsing what she actually is: a pop singer.\" After 20 years as a performer, she was described by BBC's Fiona Pryor as a fashion \"trend-setter\" and a \"style icon who constantly reinvents herself\". Pointing out the several reinventions in Minogue's image, Larissa Dubecki from The Age labelled her the \"Mother of Reinvention\".Minogue has been inspired by and compared to American artist Madonna throughout her career. She received negative comments her Rhythm of Love Tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour, for which critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe. Writing for the Observer Music Monthly, Rufus Wainwright described her as \"the anti-Madonna. Self-knowledge is a truly beautiful thing and Kylie knows herself inside out. She is what she is and there is no attempt to make quasi-intellectual statements to substantiate it. She is the gay shorthand for joy.\" Kathy McCabe for The Telegraph noted Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion, but concluded, \"Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet ... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force.\" She has said of Madonna, \"Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn't immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like me, she had done everything there was to be done\", and \"Madonna's the Queen of Pop, I'm the princess. I'm quite happy with that.\"\nIn January 2007, Madame Tussauds in London unveiled its fourth waxwork of Minogue. During the same week a bronze cast of her hands was added to Wembley Arena's \"Square of Fame\". In 2007, a bronze statue of Minogue was unveiled at Melbourne Docklands for permanent display.In March 2010, Minogue was declared by researchers as the \"most powerful celebrity in Britain\". The study examined how marketers identify celebrity and brand partnerships. Mark Husak, head of Millward Brown's UK media practice, said: \"Kylie is widely accepted as an adopted Brit. People know her, like her and she is surrounded by positive buzz\". In 2016, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, Minogue had a net worth of \u00a355 million.In May 2020, Alison Boshoff of The New Zealand Herald labelled her as the \"great comeback queen of Pop, for springing back from any setback\" in her life and career. In November 2020, Nick Levine of BBC described her as \"pop's most underestimated icon\", adding \"she's [Minogue] lasted more than 30 years by delivering pop songs with passion and panache, and retaining a quintessentially likeable persona along the way, in such a cutthroat industry.\" In June 2023, Barbara Ellen of The Guardian commented \"modesty, likeability and vulnerability have aided Minogue enduring appeal\", 36 years after the 1987 single \"I Should Be So Lucky\" was released.Minogue is regarded as a gay icon, which she has encouraged with comments including \"I am not a traditional gay icon. There's been no tragedy in my life, only tragic outfits\" and \"My gay audience has been with me from the beginning ... they kind of adopted me.\" Her status as a gay icon has been attributed to her music, fashion sense and career longevity. Author Constantine Chatzipapatheodoridis wrote about Minogue's appeal to gay men in Strike a Pose, Forever: The Legacy of Vogue... and observed she \"frequently incorporates camp-inflected themes in her extravaganzas, drawing mainly from the disco scene, the S/M culture, and the burlesque stage.\" In Beautiful Things in Popular Culture (2007), Marc Brennan stated Minogue's work \"provides a gorgeous form of escapism\". Minogue has explained she first became aware of her gay audience in 1988, when several drag queens performed to her music at a Sydney pub, and she later saw a similar show in Melbourne. She said she felt \"very touched\" to have such an \"appreciative crowd\", and this encouraged her to perform at gay venues throughout the world, as well as headlining the 1994 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Minogue has one of the largest gay followings in the world.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.Anita Lee, co-producer of Priceless, then suggested that Helen Lee make The Art of Woo, a romantic comedy sponsored by the Canadian Film Centre's Feature Film Project; it was Lee's feature film debut. Starring Adam Beach and Sook Yin Lee as Alessa Woo, the Toronto-set film follows an Asian-Canadian art dealer who finds herself living in close quarters with a handsome and talented Indigenous artist but considers him unworthy as he is penniless. The film also stars Don McKellar, Alberta Watson, Joel Keller, John Gilbert and Siu Ta. Executive producer was Peter O'Brian. Original paintings were provided by Kent Monkman to stand in for artworks by Beach's character, Ben Crowchild. Artworks were also loaned by Suzy Lake and then-Power Plant director, Marc Mayer, appears in a cameo.

Though Jon Savage wrote there were three versions of each track available, Heylin states that alternative versions for only five tracks (\"E.M.I.\", \"No Feelings\", \"Seventeen\" and \"Submission\", plus an \"album\" mix of \"Satellite\") existed. It was not until 20 September that the track list was finalised, which Heylin said \"suggests just how bogged down by the process they had become\". Richard Branson spent the night deciding the track list and which versions to use, and included all the hits on the record, despite the objections of the band, McLaren's management company Glitterbest and most of Virgin. Due to the album's long completion time, the Sex Pistols and McLaren decided to release \"Holidays in the Sun\" backed with \"Satellite\" as the band's fourth single. \"Holidays in the Sun\" was not as successful as past singles\u2014it charted at number eight and dropped out of the top 20 after four weeks\u2014which Heylin attributed to the group's announcement that their album would be released on 4 November and that the single would be included on the LP, despite previous statements to the contrary. In an attempt to stem criticism over the decision to include all four previously released Sex Pistols singles on the forthcoming LP, Virgin indicated the possibility of an \"alternative album\" being issued simultaneously, featuring a new title and two new songs replacing \"two of the former hit singles\". A label spokesman stated, \"We've put the singles on the LP because most people wanted it that way. But the alternative set would enable us to overcome the multiple stores' ban\". A ten-song test pressing was made, though no new cuts were included, with \"Satellite\" and \"Submission\" being added as bonus tracks.The Sex Pistols' contract with Virgin stated that its music would be distributed by Virgin in the United States provided Branson matched any competing offers McLaren received. However, McLaren wanted to negotiate separate deals in every territory, regardless of what the contract stipulated, which angered Branson, as the clause for American distribution was an important one he had fought for. Branson knew he had been outmanoeuvred by McLaren, for he could not sue to enforce the contract or else be perceived as acting like EMI or A&M. Competition for the band in the United States narrowed down to Warner Bros., Arista, Columbia and Casablanca Records, with Warner Bros. signing the band on 10 October for \u00a322,000.Before Virgin could release Never Mind the Bollocks, Branson discovered that two other Sex Pistols albums were competing with his label's. In October, a bootleg named Spunk featuring high-quality recordings of Sex Pistols demos and recording sessions with Dave Goodman was released on a label called Blank. Among the rumours of who was behind the release of the tapes included Goodman, Glen Matlock and McLaren, who has always considered Goodman's versions to be a more accurate representation of the band. Meanwhile, the French pressing of Never Mind the Bollocks on Barclay had added \"Submission\" to the slated 11-song track list, and was due for release a week before Virgin's edition. As McLaren's separate deal with Barclay meant that the French release could not be halted and given the Virgin head was aware of how easy it was for import records to arrive in Britain, Branson rushed production of Never Mind the Bollocks to ensure it would come out a week earlier than intended. Nevertheless, the Barclay version was already available in the UK at the time Virgin had its version ready. Ten thousand copies of Virgin's pressing erroneously only listed 11 tracks on the sleeve yet contained 12 on the actual record.Even with the availability of Spunk, the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols was eagerly awaited in the United Kingdom. With advance orders of 125,000 copies, Never Mind the Bollocks debuted at number one on the UK Album Charts the week after its release.

There was a period of indecision about what song would be released as the first single; the label wanted to get everything right for the campaign, because the all-girl group format was untested. The group, led by Brown and Halliwell, was adamant that the debut song should be \"Wannabe\", they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and the Girl Power statement. Virgin's executives believed that the first single should either be \"Say You'll Be There\", which they considered a much \"cooler\" track, or \"Love Thing\". At the beginning of 1996 the impasse between the group and their record label about the release of the single was temporarily solved. In March, Fuller announced that he agreed with Virgin in that \"Wannabe\" should not be the first single. The label wanted a song that appealed to the mainstream market, and nothing considered too radical. Halliwell was shocked and furious; she told Fuller, \"It's not negotiable as far as we're concerned. 'Wannabe' is our first single.\" Fuller and the executives at Virgin relented, and the song was chosen as their first single.The trigger for the Spice Girls' launch was the release of the \"Wannabe\" music video in May 1996. Its quick success on the British cable network The Box sparked press interest, despite initial resistance to the all-girl group idea. The same month, their first music press interviews appeared in Music Week, Top of the Pops, and Smash Hits, and their first live TV slot was broadcast on LWT's Surprise Surprise. A month after the video's release, the song was receiving intensive airplay on the main radio stations across the UK, while the group started to appear on television\u2014mainly on kid's programmes such as Live & Kicking\u2014and doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines. A full-page advertisement appeared in the July issue of Smash Hits, saying: \"Wanted: Anyone with a sense of fun, freedom and adventure. Hold tight, get ready! Girl Power is comin' at you\". The group appeared on the television programme This Morning with Richard and Judy, and performed at their first Radio One road show in Birmingham.\"Wannabe\" was first released in Japan on 26 June 1996 as a maxi CD. In the United Kingdom, the song was issued on 8 July 1996 in two single versions. The first one, released in two formats\u2014a standard CD single and a cassette single\u2014include the radio edit of the track, the Motiv 8 vocal slam remix, and the B-side, \"Bumper to Bumper\". The group wrote \"Bumper to Bumper\" with Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins\u2014the songwriter-production duo known as Absolute\u2014and British singer-songwriter Cathy Dennis. The second version, released on maxi single format on 15 July, feature the radio edit, an instrumental version, the Motiv 8 dub slam remix, and the Dave Way alternative mix. This version came with a fold-out postcard inlay and a stickered case.During the weeks following the UK release, the group began promotional visits abroad. They did three trips to Japan and brief visits to Germany and the Netherlands. On a trip to the Far East, they visited Hong Kong, Thailand, and South Korea. In January 1997 they travelled to North America to do a promotional campaign that Phil Quartararo, president of Virgin Records America, described as \"absolutely massive\". In Canada, the group did interviews for newspapers and radio stations, appeared in television programmes such as Hit List, and MusiquePlus, and attended an autograph signing at Montreal's HMV Megastore.

Immersing himself in 'the destructive element' and exploring paranoia, entropy and the love of death as primary forces in the history of our time, Pynchon establishes his imaginative continuity with the great modernist writers of the early years of this century.\" Locke noted  that \"Pynchon is obviously capable of the most intricate literary structures\u2014plots and counterplots and symbols that twist and tangle in time and space\", but was less impressed by the novel's form: \"the structure is strained beyond the breaking point. Reading it is often profoundly exasperating; the book is too long and dense; despite the cornucopia of brilliant details and grand themes, one's dominant feelings in the last one to two hundred pages are a mounting restlessness, fatigue and frustration.\"Reviewing the novel in the Saturday Review in March 1973, Richard Poirier stated that \"At thirty-six, Pynchon has established himself as a novelist of major importance.\" In the highly positive review, Poirier compared Gravity's Rainbow to Moby Dick and Ulysses, and that it  \"marks an advance beyond either book in its treatment of cultural inheritance\". Poirier noted the wide range of Pynchon's writing and said that \"Pynchon is willing and able, that is, to work from a range of perspectives infinitely wider, more difficult to manage, more learned than any to be found elsewhere in contemporary literature. His genius resides in his capacity to see, to see feelingly, how these various perspectives, apparently so diverse and chaotic, are begotten of the same technology, the same supportive structures that have foundations in the theology of the seventeenth century and the science of the nineteenth.\" (...) \"Pynchon is almost unbearably vulnerable to every aspect of contemporary experience, open to every form of sight and sound, democratically receptive to the most common and the most recondite signatures of things.\"Anthony Burgess included Gravity's Rainbow in his Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English Since 1939 (1984), writing \"this work, not yet as widely understood [as V. or The Crying of Lot 49], has a gravity more compelling than the rainbow technique (high colour, symbolism, prose tricks) would seem to imply\".On the 50th anniversary of the publication in February 2023, John Semley positively reviewed Gravity's Rainbow in Wired, noting that: \"It is at once a busy almanac of its era and a sort of field guide for our own.

Though he had numerous hit records, he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of Cole Porter's \"Begin the Beguine.\" Before the release of \"Beguine,\" Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and, after its release, he became a major pop artist within short order. The record eventually became one of the era's defining recordings. Musically restless, Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as Third Stream music, which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions. His music influenced other musicians, such as Monty Norman in England, whose \"James Bond Theme\" features a vamp possibly influenced by Shaw's 1938 recording of \"Nightmare\".Shaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the big bands he led. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1942 to 1944, during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific. Following his discharge in 1944, he returned to lead a band through 1945. Following the breakup of that band, he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity, although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music completely in 1954.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Eccles had an itinerant childhood due to his father's need to travel Jamaica seeking work. He used to regularly attend church, and he became influenced by spiritual singing; In his words: \"One of my uncles was a spiritual revivalist, who always did this heavy type of spiritual singing, and I got to love that\". Eccles's professional singing career began as a teenager, working the north-coast hotel circuit in the mid-1950s.  In his late teens, he moved to Ocho Rios, where he performed at night in various shows, with artists such as The Blues Busters, Higgs & Wilson and Buster Brown. He moved to Kingston in 1959, where he started his recording career. He first recorded for Coxsone Dodd, who had organised a talent show in which Eccles took part.Eccles had a Jamaican hit in 1961 with the early ska song \"Freedom\", which was recorded in 1959, and was featured on Dodd's sound system for two years before it was released. It was one of the first Jamaican songs with socially oriented lyrics. The song discussed the concept of repatriation to Africa, an idea developed by the growing Rastafari movement. The song became the first Jamaican hit to be used for political purposes; Alexander Bustamante, founder of the Jamaican Labour Party and at that time Chief Minister of Jamaica adopted it for his fight against the Federation of the West Indies in 1960. In the following years, Eccles had other successful songs, mixing boogie/rhythm and blues influences with ska rhythms, such as \"River Jordan\" and \"Glory Hallelujah\".\nIn 1962, he started promoting concerts and set up his Christmas Morning talent show; first with Dodd, then on his own. He organised concerts for The Clarendonians in 1963, and for The Wailers in 1964 and 1965. He launched other talent search contests, with Battle of the Stars, Clancy Eccles Revue, Independent Revue and Reggae Soul Revue, from which emerged stars such as Barrington Levy and Culture.\nStarting in 1963, he recorded with producers such as Charlie Moo (Leslie Kong's business partner) and the husband of Sonia Pottinger, Lyndon. He couldn't make a living from his music, so he quit in 1965 to work as a tailor in Annotto Bay. During this period, he made stage outfits for musicians such as Kes Chin, The Mighty Vikings, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, Carlos Malcolm and The Blues Busters.He went back to music in 1967, producing his own recordings as well as those of other artists. He scored a hit with Eric 'Monty' Morris' reggae song \"Say What You're Saying\", and with his own song \"Feel The Rhythm\", one of several records that were instrumental in the shift from rocksteady to reggae. Eccles has also been credited with deriving the name 'reggae' from streggae', Kingston slang for a good-time girl. Eccles' first hit, \"What Will Your Mama Say\" which was released by the recently created United Kingdom label, Pama Records. In 1968, his song \"Fattie Fattie\" became a skinhead reggae classic, along with his productions of recordings by the toasting DJ King Stitt (\"Fire Corner\", \"Van Cleef\", \"Herbman Shuffle\"). Eccles recorded many organ-led instrumentals with his session band The Dynamites (same band has Derrick Harriott's Crystalites), featuring Jackie Jackson, Hux Brown, Paul Douglas, Winston Wright, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Grennan, Joe Isaacs, and Hugh Malcolm, with Johnny Moore and Bobby Ellis both contributing trumpet in different sessions. In 1970, Eccles helped pave the way to the dub music genre by releasing an instrumental version of \"Herbman Shuffle\" called \"Phantom\", with a mix focusing on the bass line.\nEccles launched different record labels for his works: Clansone, New Beat and Clandisc (the latter also the name of a sub-label set up by Trojan Records for Eccles' UK releases). He recorded artists such as Alton Ellis, Joe Higgs, the Trinidian Lord Creator (\"Kingston Town\"), Larry Marshall, Hemsley Morris, Earl Lawrence, The Beltones, Glen Ricks, Cynthia Richards, Buster Brown and Beres Hammond. Appreciated by musicians for his fairness and sense of equity, he helped Lee Perry set up his Upsetter record label in 1968 after Perry left Dodd's employment, and helped Winston 'Niney' Holmes (later known as 'The Observer') record his first hit as a producer in 1971 (\"Blood & Fire\").A socialist militant, Eccles was appointed as an adviser on the music industry to Michael Manley's People's National Party (PNP) and took part in Jamaica's 1972 prime ministerial elections by organising a \"Bandwagon\" featuring musicians such as Bob Marley & the Wailers, Dennis Brown, Max Romeo, Delroy Wilson and Inner Circle, performing around the island in support of Manley's campaign. Throughout the 1970s, he remained close to Manley and wrote several songs in praise of the PNP program, including his hits \"Power for the People\", \"Rod of Correction\" or \"Generation Belly\".\nEccles' political interests meant that he spent less time on music, although in the late 1970s, Eccles had further success as a producer with recordings by Tito Simon and Exuma the Obeah Man, as well as collaborations with King Tubby. After the 1970s, new Eccles recordings were rare, and he concentrated on live concert promotion and re-issues of his back catalogue. In the 1980s, Eccles slowed down his musical activities, and he never met success again, apart from a few political songs, such as \"Dem Mash Up The Country\" in 1985. Eccles died on 30 June 2005, in Spanish Town Hospital from complications of a heart attack.\nEccles' son, Clancy Eccles Jr., has followed his father into the music business, initially performing as simply \"Clancy\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "264_130", "question": "What music label is Jimmy Barnes represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_42354", "text": "The Bad Livers formed in 1990, when Barnes \"came up with this idea that it would be great to have a small-format acoustic band that could play different kinds of music [at a] virtuoso level, where they could play any kind of music\". He began playing with Rubin and White, and the trio adopted the name Bad Livers in the summer of 1990. They began playing frequently in Austin, including a weekly set at the Saxon Pub. A typical set in 1991 included a wide variety of styles and periods of music, as Rubin later explained: \"We were doing Mississippi John Hurt, gospel tunes, Captain Beefheart\u2014anything, really, but it was Mot\u00f6rhead or the Misfits that caught on.\"Imprecise descriptions of the Bad Livers' music abounded: \"thrash-grass\", \"acoustic bluegrass with a punk death wish\", \"something called 'contemporary bluegrass,'\" and \"acoustic-metal-bluegrass\", although these same sources would cite the band as \"much-lauded\" and note that \"the musicians can really play\". The recurrence of the term bluegrass, however bizarrely it was modified, along with counter-assessments of them as \"good, faithful traditionalists\" who \"preserve the spirit as well as the technique of old-timey folk music\", created a generic perplexity that led Austin country legend Don Walser to observe that the only question he couldn't answer was what kind of music the Bad Livers played.Barnes insisted that the Bad Livers were not a bluegrass band, but had created an original sound: \"This isn't bluegrass and it isn't this or that. It's Bad Liver music. We end up making our own thing.\" Barnes' original compositions were featured on their first album, Delusions of Banjer, released in 1992 on Quarterstick Records and produced by Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers. The album was praised for \"Barnes's strong material, as well as the group's tight musical interaction\". Barnes credited the latter with improving the former: \"The musical telepathy is really good. I can sort of tailor-make a song to the guys' playing, make the song fit what they're doing, since I write most of the material.\"Rubin claimed that they had decided to incorporate the accordion and tuba into the band to counteract their growing popularity, but to no avail: their audience continued to widen and more critics saw beyond the gimmicky descriptions to the band's innovation and skill. The Washington Post described them as \"truly great\", The Times-Picayune praised their \"serious musicianship\" and Barnes' \"soulful, urgent lead vocals\", while Rolling Stone admired their \"striking blend of virtuoso flash and poignant simplicity\". Don McLeese of the Austin American-Statesman twice described the Bad Livers as \"Austin's best band\" and raved of one live show: \"The uncommon telepathy enjoyed by Danny Barnes, Mark Rubin and Ralph White makes the band's frenetic acoustic interplay sound like the work of a six-armed, multistringed monster.\" Barnes was voted \"Best Player of Any Other Instrument\" for the banjo at the Austin Music Awards in 1991 and 1992, and the Bad Livers were voted \"Best None of the Above\" for four consecutive years from 1991 to 1994.The Bad Livers' second album, Horses in the Mines, was produced by Barnes and released on Quarterstick in 1994. In his review, McLeese admired them as \"a band drawing from the wellspring of tradition to create something fresh, vital and original\". S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung found that the record \"sounded quite authentic\u2014almost as if it had long held a place in the Library of Congress\". Raoul Hern\u00e1ndez poetically concurred, saying that the record sounded \"like a bunch of skeletons cackling into the sole microphone that dangles from the outhouse ceiling\".The Bad Livers spent 1995 and 1996 touring and working on side projects as well as looking for a new label to release their next album. Finally the band signed a three-album deal with Sugar Hill Records, which had more experience than Quarterstick at \"selling banjo records\". Their first album for the label, Hogs on the Highway, was released along with the information that White had decided to leave the band. It was announced that he was to be replaced by Bob Grant, though Grant's tenure with the band did not last long. Both White and Grant appeared on Hogs on the Highway, which received enthusiastic reviews from Sing Out!, praising Barnes' \"quirky and inventive\" original songs, and the Old-Time Herald, admiring the \"considerable skill\" with which Barnes crafted his lyrics. The Austin American-Statesman agreed that Barnes was \"an entirely underrated songwriter\" as well as a \"banjo wizard\", while The Washington Post lauded his \"timeless, deadpan voice\". The Sydney Morning Herald was appreciative of the \"beautifully controlled ambience\" of the entire album.\nShortly after the album's release, Barnes moved from Austin to Port Hadlock, Washington, though he and Rubin continued to work closely together on the score for the Richard Linklater film The Newton Boys as well as the Bad Livers' next album. Although the soundtrack was admired by The Village Voice and Entertainment Weekly as well as the Austin papers, the film did not fare well at the box office, and the soundtrack album did not sell well. The Bad Livers' second album for Sugar Hill, Industry and Thrift, was released in September 1998 with only Barnes and Rubin credited as members of the band, though the album features various guest musicians, including members of Rubin's side project, Rubinchik\u2019s Orkestyr, who are featured on the track \"A Yid Ist Geboren inz Oklahoma\". The album garnered positive reviews, and the Chicago Tribune selected it as the best bluegrass album of 1998, while The Times of London admired its \"genuine originality\". Industry and Thrift did not receive as much attention from the press as Hogs on the Highway had, however, and as Barnes lamented, the album \"fell off the face of the earth\".The Bad Livers' final album, Blood and Mood, was released in February 2000 and featured, as The Austin Chronicle noted with astonishment: \"Electric punk rock, sample-based tunes with drum tracks, and a shocking scarcity of juiced-up banjo playing\". The Independent named it \"the leftfield album of the week\" and found that it \"brims with enthusiastic ideas\", while The Washington Post was puzzled but invigorated by a live show supporting the album, concluding that it had been \"Fascinating. Even refreshing\". Although it left No Depression depressed, Daniel Wolff found the album to be uniquely evocative of a \"rural eccentricity\" that had not yet been extinguished and formed a kind of continuum with punk and old-time country: \"Either the Bad Livers pick up where 'I Wish I Were a Mole in the Ground' left off, or Bascom Lunsford discovered the punk aesthetic in the 1920s.\" Blood and Mood did not sell well, and by the summer of 2000 the Bad Livers appeared to be \"over for good\".The Bad Livers were inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame in 2007.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Just the whole long, drawn-out standstill behind it and how it kind of turned into a phoenix-rising type of deal, with people giving it mad love online and just became this underground type of sensation. So that's the real revenge, the music couldn't be shut down or hidden, but people got it and they loved it, just like I loved making it. That was the meaning behind 'revenge,' and 'Airtight' is just an old nickname that I got.\nBack in the day, I used to really be into reading Donald Goines and Iceberg Slim. I casually read both of their whole catalogs, and they inspired me as a songwriter also, but there's a book Iceberg Slim wrote and the title is Airtight Willie & Me. I kind of kept that name, 'Airtight.' And I think even back then I thought it would be dope to have an album with the title Airtight-something, so Airtight's Revenge sounded like a black exploitation film.

In an interview with Parlour Magazine, Bilal elaborated on the message behind the album's cover art, stating:\n\nI'm killing them with the words. This album was my version of Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" and a retrospective look on the world and where we are today. There\u2019s not a lot of music like that these days.

Meeting at university and becoming good friends, the duo spent the subsequent two years releasing experimental instrumental tracks. The origins of their music were influenced by the golden era of progressive rock in the 1970s and traditional English folk music.After their LPs Road to Darkness and From a Point of Existence were favorably reviewed by G. W. Hill at Music Street Journal for their mix of neo-prog, folk and hard rock, they recruited German drummer Stefan Hepe to work on their fourth full release, listing him in the liner notes as one of the \"Additional Wanderers Intercepting the Signal\".\nGandalf's Fist released the subsequent LP A Day in the Life of a Universal Wanderer in September 2013, being the last release by the band under the US label Musik&Film and received widespread coverage from progressive rock journalists (Classic Rock Magazine, Prog Magazine, Powerplay Magazine, Fireworks Magazine).After accepting the offer to play at the \"Second Stage\" at Planet Radio \"Planet Rockstock\" in Great Yarmouth, Gandalf's Fist promoted guest musician drummer Stefan Hepe and touring bassist Christopher Ewen, making them full members.\nAs a four-piece, the band wrote new material for their fifth full-length release called A Forest of Fey, which features Troy Donockley, John Mitchell, Dave Oberl\u00e9 and Clive Nolan as guest musicians.

Three songs were completely re-recorded or mixed, and the album is available as \"name your price\" via their Bandcamp page.\nIn November 2015, the band announced work on their sixth album, stating it will again be a concept album planned to be released in 2016.

Although larger operators made use of commercial copying services, anybody who had access to copying equipment (such as the portable tape-to-tape cassette players that became common in the early 1980s) could release a tape, and publicize it in the network of fanzines and newsletters that served the scene, such as OP Magazine, Factsheet Five and Unsound. The cassette culture became an inexpensive and democratic way for artists to make available music that was never likely to have mainstream appeal, and many found in the scene music that was more imaginative, challenging, beautiful, and groundbreaking than much of what was being released by the established music industry.\nIn the United States, cassette culture was associated with DIY sound collage, riot grrrl, and punk music and blossomed across the country on cassette labels such as: Psyclones, Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine, Randy Greif's Swinging Axe Productions, Pass the Buck, E.F. Tapes, Mindkill, Happiest Tapes on Earth, Apraxia Music Research, and Sound of Pig (which released over 300 titles), From the Wheelchair to the Pulpit, Walls of Genius (which released over 30 titles, including their own, Architects Office and The Miracle), K Records, brown interior music.

In 2009 Andrew Szava-Kovats, who was involved in the US scene under the name Data-Bank-A, released a 60-minute documentary Grindstone Redux: A Documentary About 1980's Cassette Culture on the American cassette network, with contributions from many of those involved.

The label, which is actually the second incarnation (the first Universal Records was a short-lived underground imprint of MCA Records that existed from 1988 to 1989) was created by former Universal Music Group chairman and CEO Doug Morris and Daniel Glass (founder of Glassnote Records), who became its president.\nIn 1996, to complement the MCA renaming into Universal, MCA Music Entertainment Group was also rebranded into what is known today as Universal Music Group. With that in place, Universal Records was to operate under the newly renamed UMG banner.Universal Records had success in breaking new artists, including the multi-platinum debut of Erykah Badu, Billie Myers, Goldfinger, Akon and the Lost Boyz. Glass formed relationships with independent record labels such as Kedar Entertainment and Mojo Records. Universal also brought in and took over Uptown Records following founder Andre Harrell's departure. Following Heavy D's dropping from the imprint in 1997, Universal folded Uptown in 1999.New Orleans, Louisiana based record company Cash Money Records, led by Ronald \"Slim\" Williams and Bryan \"Baby/Birdman\" Williams, signed a three-year $30 million distribution deal with Universal Records in March 1998. Under the terms of the deal, the Williams were given a $3 million advance each year and a credit of $1.5 million for each of the up to six artists that they had at the time. After recouping, Universal Records would retain 15% of profits from album sales, while Cash Money retained 85% as well as ownership of all master recordings. Cash Money's first success under Universal was Juvenile's November 1998 release, 400 Degreez. The album peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 and would ultimately go on to be certified quadruple platinum in the United States. Cash Money and Universal also launched Lil Wayne's career with his November 1999 album Tha Block Is Hot, which was a top three Billboard 200 album and later certified platinum in America.On December 10, 1998, Seagram completed its seven-month $10.6 billion plan to acquire PolyGram, merging its music division of labels with UMG, helping both divisions combine operations together under the biggest music recording company. On New Year's Eve 1998, Universal Records was pooled together with then-PolyGram label Motown Records and fellow MCA label Republic Records to form Universal Motown Republic Group; Motown was previously brought under UMG during its preceding days as MCA Inc. It was a subsidiary of MCA Records and was minority-owned by Boston Ventures until 1991. To start the New Year in 1999, Universal Motown Republic Group became one of the three new music units under UMG alongside Interscope Geffen A&M Records and The Island Def Jam Music Group.In 2001, after the absorption of Priority Records into EMI, No Limit Records was signed a distribution deal with Universal and renamed \"The New No Limit\". However, this deal failed as various releases by Master P, Romeo, 504 Boyz and Choppa did not meet commercial expectations. No Limit cut ties with Universal in 2004, a year after filing for bankruptcy.Bad Boy Entertainment, founded by Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs, signed a three-year marketing and distribution deal with Universal Records in February 2003, following its departure from Arista Records. Universal and Bad Boy released Da Band's September 2003 album, Too Hot for TV. The album was ultimately certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Albums under this deal that followed include the soundtrack to Bad Boys II, Loon's self-titled album, Carl Thomas' Let's Talk About It, Mario Winans' Hurt No More and New Edition's One Love. In 2005, Bad Boy switched distribution from Universal to Atlantic Records before the deal could be fulfilled.The label later had more success with acts like 3 Doors Down, 98 Degrees, Chamillionaire, Godsmack, Mushroomhead, Flaw, Hatebreed, Lifer, Jack Johnson, Juvenile, Nelly, Big Sha, Lil Wayne, and Mika. In the summer of 2004, Universal had a big success with Terror Squad's single, \"Lean Back\", which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 that August.By 2005, Universal was reaching its downfall, even though Cash Money kept its prophecy leading, but its success was short-lived. On New Year's Eve 2005, Universal Records was merged with Republic Records to become Universal Republic Records. Motown (as a standalone label) was renamed Universal Motown Records. Therefore, artists under Motown, as well as hip hop and R&B acts under Universal were combined together under Universal Motown, with the rest being transferred to Universal Republic, which would later be reverted back to Republic Records in 2012, a year after Universal Motown was changed back to Motown, which itself would be moved to Island Def Jam. As a result, the Universal Motown Republic Group was disbanded in the summer of 2011 during a reorganization at Universal Music Group, which was under the leadership of Lucian Grainge.It was also the distributor of Polydor and Island UK in the United States. Distribution switched to Interscope Geffen A&M Records and Republic Records respectively after the label's dissolution. Island's operation in the United Kingdom, in 2013, would be absorbed into Virgin EMI Records would itself would be rebranded in 2020 as EMI Records, taking over distribution for Republic UK.\nAs of December 2023, Universal Records is currently inactive as its artists would later be drafted to Republic Records. Motown is currently under the Capitol Music Group, which it has been a part of since 2014 following another UMG disbandment of the Island Def Jam Music Group. Therefore, reissues of releases under the Universal Records, Universal Republic or Universal Motown names will be handled by Republic and Motown respectively on behalf of Universal Music Enterprises.\nThere have been unrelated Universal Records labels in Europe and the Philippines. Because of an unrelated label in the Philippines owning the rights to the Universal Records name in that country, parent company Universal Music Group did business there as MCA Music, Inc., using UMG's former name.

After touring the album with Kay Kay and His Weathered Underground, Jurado began work on his next album. On February 21, 2012, he released his 10th studio album, Maraqopa, his sixth for Secretly Canadian. In January 2014, Jurado released Brothers and Sisters of the Eternal Son, an album which marked the third straight collaboration with producer Richard Swift. In March 2016, Jurado released Visions of Us on the Land, and in December of the same year he and Swift released a collection of covers from 2010, Other People's Songs, Volume 1. In 2016, Damien Jurado released The Horizon Just Laughed, his first self produced album, teaming up with L.A. recording studio Sonikwire. In 2018, Jurado left Secretly Canadian to join Mama Bird Recording Co. and Loose Music and subsequently released the albums In The Shape Of A Storm (2019) and What's New, Tomboy? (2020)\nOn the 14th of May 2021, Jurado released his 17th full length studio album, The Monster Who Hated Pennsylvania, his first on his own label, Maraqopa Records. \nOn the 24th of June 2022 Jurado released his 18th full length studio album and the second on Maraqopa Records called Reggae Film Star, it is a concept album, telling the story of people that are working on a movie.\nOn March 31, 2023, Jurado released his 19th studio album, Sometimes You Hurt the Ones You Hate, on his own label, Maraqopa Records.

The shows were considered lackluster and the members were excessive in their drug use.  The \"breaking point\" came when Gregg Allman testified in the trial of erstwhile road manager Scooter Herring. Bandmates considered him a \"snitch,\" and he received death threats, leading to law-enforcement protection. Herring was convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and received a 75-year prison sentence, which were later overturned as he received a lesser sentence. For his part, Allman always maintained that Herring had told him to take the deal and he would take the fall for it, but nevertheless, the band refused to communicate with him. As a result, the band finally broke up; Leavell, Williams, and Jaimoe continued playing together in Sea Level, Betts formed Great Southern, and Allman founded the Gregg Allman Band.Betts approached Allman with the prospect of a reunion in 1978. Allman, who was addicted to Dilaudid and vodka, met with his former bandmates after completing a detox program. He, Betts, Trucks, and Jaimoe all agreed to reform. \"No one was pleased with how things had ended back in \u201976, and the combination of the passing of time, missing each other musically, and money all made it easier for us to put the past behind us,\" Allman later wrote. Together, the rest of the band joined Great Southern for five songs during an August concert in New York's Central Park. Williams and Leavell were invited for the reunion, but were busy with Sea Level (Jaimoe had left the band several months prior). As a result, the Allman Brothers added two new members from Great Southern: guitarist \"Dangerous\" Dan Toler and bassist David \"Rook\" Goldflies. Jaimoe summarized the performance: \"We were a little rusty\u2014maybe a lot rusty\u2014and we were playing with some different guys, but it felt good to be together.\" Following this, the band made an appearance at the annual Capricorn Records picnic.The band were immediately pressured to record a new album, but declined, in order to see how everyone communicated \"musically and spiritually.\" The band went into rehearsals in Sarasota, Florida, staying together at the Pirates Den on Anna Maria Island. The main reason for living together at the Pirates Den was to see if they could simply get along together. Meanwhile, former record label Capricorn Records had been splintering, and the band were not receiving their royalty payments. An audit revealed Capricorn was deep in debt to PolyGram Records; manager Phil Walden had borrowed $4 million he could not return. Steve Massarsky became the band's manager during this time, and helped renegotiate a deal with Capricorn Records. Despite their past royalty troubles, they trusted in Walden to get the record significant airplay and sales. Despite this, \"Dickey Betts filed suit against Walden, alleging nonpayment of record and publishing royalties.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

John offered to sign Iggy Pop & The Stooges to the label, but they declined.

With an album called \"499 2139\" (which incidentally was the studio's telephone number) they turned to the talents of Pete Waterman (of Stock Aitken Waterman fame). Waterman and his then assistant Tony Keys recorded and produced a unique mixture of music which, although it only grazed the bottom of the album charts, managed to capture a mixture of genres including a track from The Lambrettas called \"Go Steady\".\nIn the US and Canada, John's residency on his own label was short-lived. After only one album, Blue Moves, and a couple of singles (including the hits \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" and \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\"), he returned to MCA. At this time, The Rocket Record Company switched distribution to RCA after being dropped from MCA.

The original lineup of Holt, Peck, Kelvin Cruz (lead vocals), Jeff Harber (guitar, keys, backing vocals), Justin Powell (bass), and Joy Welling (violin) independently released their debut EP, Silence Is Golden, in late 2003. The EP gained them internet exposure and created an underground following, leading to talks of a record deal with Interscope. Due to musical differences, Holt (guitar/band co-founder) and ATFEH parted ways, and long-time friend Phil Nguyen joined the band in Holt's place. In support of the EP, ATFEH embarked on their first nationwide tour in 2004, during which Welling (violin) parted ways with the band due to personal differences. The band never replaced the violinist or added any other full-time instruments to the group's sound. ATFEH recorded their first full-length album, Things Aren't So Beautiful Now, with producer Shawn Sullivan (Bleeding Through, Reel Big Fish) in the summer of 2004. The album, featuring five reworked songs from the EP and five new songs, was released on October 19, 2004, through Interscope's subsidiary, Kickball Records. After recording the album, Peck (drums/band co-founder) also parted ways with the band, leaving the permanent drummer position open for a year afterward.\nOver the next few years, ATFEH toured around the United States as both supporting band and headlining band, such as on their headlining tour in March 2006 sponsored by Purevolume. Openers have included From First to Last, Hit the Lights, and Boys Like Girls. ATFEH also toured with such bands as Fall Out Boy, Jimmy Eat World, Head Automatica, Taking Back Sunday, Emery, Boys Night Out, My American Heart, The Receiving End of Sirens, A Static Lullaby, and more.  They played many festivals, such as Surf & Skate (2004), The Bamboozle (2005, 2006, Bamboozle Left 2006), and two years of The Vans Warped Tour (2004, 2005). In 2005, they self-recorded (via their bassist and notable producer Justin Powell) two cover songs for major compilation releases: Oingo Boingo's \"Dead Man's Party\" for the Punk Goes 80s compilation, and \"Jellybelly\" for The Killer in You: A Tribute to Smashing Pumpkins. Tyler Mahurin (A Static Lullaby, Hollywood Undead) was added as official drummer in 2005. ATFEH also appeared on Fuse's \"Steven's Untitled Rock Show\" on May 29, 2006.\nImpressed with the debut album's success, Interscope spent the next couple years grooming the band for a main label release. The resulting second full-length album, It's Hard to Move You, was ultimately set to be released on July 31, 2007. It was mostly recorded with producer Matt Squire (Panic! At the Disco); some tracks were recorded with Mark Hoppus of Blink-182. After years of writing/recording and numerous delays, It's Hard to Move You leaked online in its entirety on June 1, 2007. Soon after, Interscope closed its Kickball Records subsidiary, leaving talks of a main label move indefinitely in limbo and the album shelved ever since. ATFEH is currently trying to gain the rights to the record; a petition regarding the matter began circulating the Internet in 2015.Mounting issues for the band took a toll on Harber (guitar, keys, vocals), who parted ways with the band in 2007. Mahurin (drums) also left the band in 2007 to join A Static Lullaby. The two were replaced by Casey Hill and Matt Thorsen, respectively.\nWith the band's label status in disrepair and the lineup drastically changed, ATFEH took some time to regroup, and reemerged with their second self-released EP, aptly titled Pick Up the Pieces, which was released on July 1, 2008. \nIn early 2009, Powell (bass) announced that he, too, would be leaving the band, and Ryan Warrell served as the bassist during the band's final months. Cruz (lead vocals), the last member to be added to the original lineup, was the only original member left at the band's end. On March 20, 2009, the band posted a blog on their MySpace saying that they are going on an indefinite hiatus. Hi-Fighter, a long-running side-project including Powell, Cruz, and Holt, also came to an end several months later.Cruz and Powell went on to start the electro/pop/rock group \"Come On, Come On!\"In 2013, marking the band's tenth birthday, frontman Kelvin Cruz made speculation of a band reunion including most of the original members. In April 2014, this came to fruition, as Holt, Harber, Powell, Cruz, and Nguyen came together to play a small festival in Southern California, the band's first show in over five years.\nOn June 17, 2016, A Thorn for Every Heart played a second reunion show with fellow resurrected band and long-time friends A Static Lullaby at the Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood.

Opening track \"\u00c9g anda\" takes an age to get underway, reverb-heavy guitars chiming quietly before J\u00f3nsi's distinctive falsetto floats in over what sounds like an army of music boxes, and, though Rembihn\u00fatur lifts off towards its end in a familiar fashion, drums are largely limited to distorted electronic pulses and there are none of the earth-scorching effects that have previously characterised similar moments,\" and that \"for those more patient, however, the album represents calm after a storm, and highlights how Sigur R\u00f3s remain as eager to challenge themselves as their audience.\"Drowned in Sound stated that \"this is not an album of easy melodies, of playful riffs and crowd-pleasing moments. Indeed, it seems not for the crowd at all: as background music this fades away, shrinking into a still corner away from the noise.\" They later said that \"Valtari seems rather brave: across a runtime of nearly an hour there's little effort to hold our attention, to vary the tone or venture anywhere, anywhere near mainstream appeal.

At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on 36 reviews. AllMusic writer Tim Sendra said the album was \"filled with giant washes of sound bathed in reverb, echoing keyboards, smears of strings, and massed backing vocals, the album ebbs and flows from giant crescendos to heartbreakingly intimate moments with Jonsi's otherworldly voice riding the waves like a mythical dolphin\", ending the review saying, \"On the surface, Valtari may seem like a step back for the band, but instead of just retreading the past, the album is one of their best; a refined display of their musical power with breathtaking dynamics and enough emotion to flood an ocean.\" The A.V. Club said that \"the relative restraint on the single 'Ekki M\u00fakk' and other more straightforward songs like 'Var\u00fa\u00f0' and 'Rembihn\u00fatur' is a welcome shift for the group, ditching the bigger-is-better grandiloquence and predictable arcs of Sigur R\u00f3s' recent work.\" BBC Music writer Wyndham Wallace said that \"much of the album sounds like it's made up of what would, in previous years, have only qualified as the introductions to songs. Opening track \"\u00c9g anda\" takes an age to get underway, reverb-heavy guitars chiming quietly before J\u00f3nsi's distinctive falsetto floats in over what sounds like an army of music boxes, and, though Rembihn\u00fatur lifts off towards its end in a familiar fashion, drums are largely limited to distorted electronic pulses and there are none of the earth-scorching effects that have previously characterised similar moments,\" and that \"for those more patient, however, the album represents calm after a storm, and highlights how Sigur R\u00f3s remain as eager to challenge themselves as their audience.\"Drowned in Sound stated that \"this is not an album of easy melodies, of playful riffs and crowd-pleasing moments. Indeed, it seems not for the crowd at all: as background music this fades away, shrinking into a still corner away from the noise.\" They later said that \"Valtari seems rather brave: across a runtime of nearly an hour there's little effort to hold our attention, to vary the tone or venture anywhere, anywhere near mainstream appeal. And sure, huge swathes of this may run the risk of passing by unnoticed, of blurring into a single reverbed note, but that's our responsibility, and quite frankly our loss\", ending the review saying \"Valtari might not be a huge digression for the band but that doesn't matter: this is quietly, entrancingly and thoroughly sublime.\" NME, however, wrote that \"this record will maintain their fan base, but it won't attract a new one\". Pitchfork was not so positive either, stating, \"The problem isn't that Valtari aspires to beauty, even if it's a commonplace, celestial understanding of it. Sigur R\u00f3s have proven they can make indelible music that's pretty and unpredictable, pretty and melodic, pretty and unnerving, pretty and inspiring.

{"id": "264_236", "question": "What music label is Bob Dylan's Dream represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_53301", "text": "Dylan spent much of the summer of 1964 in Woodstock, a small town in upstate New York where his manager, Albert Grossman, had a place. When Joan Baez went to see Dylan that August, they stayed at Grossman's house. Baez recalls that \"most of the month or so we were there, Bob stood at the typewriter in the corner of his room, drinking red wine and smoking and tapping away relentlessly for hours. And in the dead of night, he would wake up, grunt, grab a cigarette, and stumble over to the typewriter again.\" Dylan already had one song ready for his next album: \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" was written in February 1964 but omitted from Another Side of Bob Dylan. Another song, \"Gates of Eden\", was also written earlier that year, appearing in the original manuscripts to Another Side of Bob Dylan; a few lyrical changes were eventually made, but it's unclear if these were made that August in Woodstock. At least two songs were written that month: \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\" and \"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\". During this time, Dylan's lyrics became increasingly surreal, and his prose grew more stylistic, often resembling stream-of-consciousness writing with published letters dating from 1964 becoming increasingly intense and dreamlike as the year wore on.\nDylan returned to the city, and on August 28, he met the Beatles for the first time in their New York hotel. In retrospect, this meeting with the Beatles would prove to be influential to the direction of Dylan's music, as he would soon record music invoking a rock sound for at least the next three albums. Dylan would remain on good terms with the Beatles, and as biographer Clinton Heylin writes, \"the evening established a personal dimension to the very real rivalry that would endure for the remainder of a momentous decade.\"\nDylan and producer Tom Wilson were soon experimenting with their own fusion of rock and folk music. The first unsuccessful test involved overdubbing a \"Fats Domino early rock & roll thing\" over Dylan's earlier, acoustic recording of \"House of the Rising Sun\", according to Wilson. This took place in the Columbia 30th Street Studio in December 1964. It was quickly discarded, though Wilson would more famously use the same technique of overdubbing an electric backing track to an existing acoustic recording with Simon & Garfunkel's \"The Sound of Silence\". In the meantime, Dylan turned his attention to another folk-rock experiment conducted by John P. Hammond, an old friend and musician whose father, John H. Hammond, originally signed Dylan to Columbia. Hammond was planning an electric album around the blues songs that framed his acoustic live performances of the time. To do this, he recruited three members of an American/Canadian bar band he met sometime in 1963: guitarist Robbie Robertson, drummer Levon Helm, and organist Garth Hudson (members of the Hawks, who would go on to become the Band). Dylan was very aware of the resulting album, So Many Roads; according to his friend, Danny Kalb, \"Bob was really excited about what John Hammond was doing with electric blues. I talked to him in the Figaro in 1964 and he was telling me about John and his going to Chicago and playing with a band and so on \u2026\"However, when Dylan and Wilson began work on the next album, they temporarily refrained from their own electric experimentation. The first session, held on January 13, 1965, in Columbia's Studio A in New York, was recorded solo, with Dylan playing piano or acoustic guitar. Ten complete songs and several song sketches were produced, nearly all of which were discarded. Take one of \"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\" would be used for the album, but three would eventually be released: \"I'll Keep It With Mine\" on 1985's Biograph, and \"Farewell Angelina\" and an acoustic version of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" on 1991's The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991.\nOther songs and sketches recorded at this session: \"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\", \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\", \"She Belongs to Me\", \"On the Road Again\", \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\", \"You Don't Have to Do That\", \"California,\" and \"Outlaw Blues\", all of which were original compositions.\nDylan and Wilson held another session at Studio A the following day, this time with a full, electric band. Guitarists Al Gorgoni, Kenny Rankin, and Bruce Langhorne were recruited, as were pianist Paul Griffin, bassists Joseph Macho Jr. and William E. Lee, and drummer Bobby Gregg. The day's work focused on eight songs, all of which had been attempted the previous day. According to Langhorne, there was no rehearsal, \"we just did first takes and I remember that, for what it was, it was amazingly intuitive and successful.\" Few takes were required of each song, and after three and a half hours of recording (lasting from 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm), master takes of \"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\", \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", \"Outlaw Blues\", \"She Belongs to Me\", and \"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\" were all recorded and selected for the final album.Sometime after dinner, Dylan reportedly continued recording with a different set of musicians, including John P. Hammond and John Sebastian (only Langhorne returned from earlier that day). They recorded six songs, but the results were deemed unsatisfactory and ultimately rejected.\n\nAnother session was held at Studio A the next day, and it would be the last one needed. Once again, Dylan kept at his disposal the musicians from the previous day (that is, those that participated in the 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm session); the one exception was pianist Paul Griffin, who was unable to attend and replaced by Frank Owens. Daniel Kramer recalls: The musicians were enthusiastic. They conferred with one another to work out the problems as they arose. Dylan bounced around from one man to another, explaining what he wanted, often showing them on the piano what was needed until, like a giant puzzle, the pieces would fit and the picture emerged whole \u2026 Most of the songs went down easily and needed only three or four takes \u2026 In some cases, the first take sounded completely different from the final one because the material was played at a different tempo, perhaps, or a different chord was chosen, or solos may have been rearranged...His method of working, the certainty of what he wanted, kept things moving.\nThe session began with \"Maggie's Farm\": only one take was recorded, and it was the only one they'd ever need. From there, Dylan successfully recorded master takes of \"On the Road Again\", \"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\", \"Gates of Eden\", \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", and \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\", all of which were set aside for the album. A master take of \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\" was also selected, but it would not be included on the album; instead, it was issued as a single-only release in Europe, but not in the US or the UK.\nThough Dylan was able to record electric versions of virtually every song included on the final album, he apparently never intended Bringing It All Back Home to be completely electric. As a result, roughly half of the finished album would feature full electric band arrangements while the other half consisted of solo acoustic performances, sometimes accompanied by Langhorne, who would embellish Dylan's acoustic performance with a countermelody on his electric guitar.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He also praised the musicianship, particularly Reed and Quine's guitar work, writing that they \"interact with a sort of empathy and lucidity one expects from a seasoned jazz combo and the music always reaches out to invite the listener in, even at its most intensely personal level.\"Robert Christgau of The Village Voice initially gave The Blue Mask an A+ rating: \"Never has Lou sounded more Ginsbergian, more let-it-all-hang-out than on this, his most controlled, plainspoken, deeply felt, and uninhibited album...he sounds glad to be alive, so that horror and pain become occasions for courage and eloquence as well as bitterness and sarcasm.\" Christgau also praised the musicianship, writing that \"Reed's voice - precise, conversational, stirring whether offhand or inspirational - sings his love of language itself, with Fernando Saunders's bass articulating his tenderness and the guitars of Robert Quine and Reed himself fleshing out the terrible beauty he's borne.\"Ira Robbins of Trouser Press praised the album as \"a triumphant success\" with \"some of Reed's strongest writing in years. The portraits he paints are miserable characters living outside society; it's not clear whether or not they're fictional.\"NME said, \"What made The Blue Mask Lou Reed\u2019s watershed album was his choice of musicians, a new wave super-set of them \u2013 Fernando Saunders on bass, Doane Perry on drums, and the legendary Robert Quine on guitar.Alternately, Barney Hoskyns criticized the album for a \"smarmy self-satisfaction that said: 'I may have been a bit of a jerk when I strutted around on stage with a needle in my arm, but I am now a bona fide Artist and you will treat me as such.'\"The Blue Mask would later place fifth in The Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll.In a retrospective appraisal, Jess Harvell of Pitchfork praised Quine's \"virtuoso blend of post-Reed skronk and speed-folkie melodicism\" and wrote that \"The Blue Mask is still the one to slot alongside Transformer and Street Hassle. The album realigned Reed with the punk and new/no wave movements he helped sire, and it was helped into the canon by Reed's strongest (and most heart-wrenching) batch of songs in years.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "264_238", "question": "What music label is One for the Kids represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_7364", "text": "In the years following its release, Kid A attracted acclaim. In 2005, Pitchfork wrote that it had \"challenged and confounded\" Radiohead's audience, and subsequently \"transformed into an intellectual symbol of sorts ... Owning it became 'getting it'; getting it became 'anointing it'.\" In 2015, Sheffield likened Radiohead's change in style to Bob Dylan's controversial move to rock music, writing that critics now hesitated to say they had disliked it at the time. He described Kid A as the \"defining moment in the Radiohead legend\". A year later, Billboard argued that Kid A was the first album since Bowie's Low to have moved \"rock and electronic music forward in such a mature fashion\". In an article for Kid A's 20th anniversary, the Quietus suggested that the negative reviews had been motivated by rockism, the tendency among music critics to venerate rock music over other genres.In a 2011 Guardian article about his critical Melody Maker review, Beaumont wrote that though his opinion had not changed, \"Kid A's status as a cultural cornerstone has proved me, if not wrong, then very much in the minority ... People whose opinions I trust claim it to be their favourite album ever.\" In 2014, Brice Ezell of PopMatters wrote that Kid A is \"more fun to think and write about than it is to actually listen to\" and a \"far less compelling representation of the band's talents than The Bends and OK Computer\". In 2016, Dorian Lynskey wrote in The Guardian: \"At times, Kid A is dull enough to make you fervently wish that they'd merged the highlights with the best bits of the similarly spotty Amnesiac ... Yorke had given up on coherent lyrics so one can only guess at what he was worrying about.\"Grantland credited Kid A for pioneering the use of internet to stream and promote music, writing: \"For many music fans of a certain age and persuasion, Kid A was the first album experienced primarily via the internet \u2013 it's where you went to hear it, read the reviews, and argue about whether it was a masterpiece ... Listen early, form an opinion quickly, state it publicly, and move on to the next big record by the official release date. In that way, Kid A invented modern music culture as we know it.\" In his 2005 book Killing Yourself to Live, critic Chuck Klosterman interpreted Kid A as a prediction of the September 11 attacks.Speaking at Radiohead's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2019, David Byrne of Talking Heads, one of Radiohead's formative influences, said: \"What was really weird and very encouraging was that [Kid A] was popular. It was a hit! It proved to me that the artistic risk paid off and music fans sometimes are not stupid.\" In 2020, Billboard wrote that the success of the \"challenging\" Kid A established Radiohead as \"heavy hitters in the business for the long run\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

I suppose I had a secret desire to sing.\" They soon teamed up with bass guitarist Alex Keyser and drummer Andy Henderson, who had previously played with PJ Harvey's band. Guitarist Debbie Smith, formerly of Curve, came on board in 1994. According to the Epic Records' website, the group came up with the name Echobelly from the notion of \"being hungry for something\". With Madan and Johansson as the band's songwriters, they recorded their debut EP, Bellyache, on the independent Pandemonium label in late 1993.The favourable response to Bellyache helped Echobelly secure a recording contract with Rhythm King, which was then part of Epic. Once on board the label, the group released the \"I Can't Imagine the World Without Me\" single in June 1994. The group then recorded the album Everyone's Got One, which included the single \"Insomniac\" and reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart. The single was featured in the film and soundtrack of Dumb and Dumber.\nAs their music received more airplay, Echobelly won admiration from other artists as well. Madonna expressed interest in putting them on her Maverick label (existing contractual arrangements prevented that), and R.E.M. requested the group as the opening act for their upcoming tour. The band returned to the studio in 1995 to create their next album, On, produced by Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie, who had also produced Hole and Radiohead.\nMadan's lyrics often ventured into the less explored side of life, addressed in songs such as \"King of the Kerb\". and \"Dark Therapy\". \"I wanted to challenge myself as a lyricist on a different level on this album,\" Madan said in Rolling Stone. \"I want people to tell me what they thought the lyrics are about. I'm not a politician. I'm not interested in changing everybody around me. I'm interested in myself.\"\nWhile many of the songs lamented the state of things, others on the On album celebrated the endless possibilities of the human spirit. In \"Great Things\", Madan sang \"I want to do great things / I don't want to compromise / I want to know what love is / I want to know everything.\" The album's mostly optimistic feel provides an intriguing contrast with its serious subject matter. As Pareles wrote, \"Both music and lyrics examine the tension between order and liberty\". Listeners in the UK responded favourably to the album, driving three singles from the release into the Top 30 of the UK Singles Chart. Sales of the album rose to over 150,000 in the UK, nearly double that of Everyone's Got One.\nHealth and legal problems interrupted the success of Echobelly in 1995 and 1996. Madan had a serious thyroid problem during her world tour that was potentially life-threatening, but was later cured. Bass guitarist James Harris joined after Keyser defected because of personal and artistic differences. The group also had disagreements with Rhythm King after the label moved to Arista. The band chose to stay with Epic. In 1996, Madan also ventured away from the group when she sang on a recording of the club band, Lithium. Smith left the band before the release of the band's third album Lustra, which was produced by Gil Norton and issued in November 1997. A single from the album, \"The World is Flat\", was released in August of that year.A four-year hiatus was brought to an end in 2001 when the band returned with the Digit EP and their fourth album, People Are Expensive (produced by Ben Hillier), which were released on their own Fry Up label. Two further singles, \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Kali Yuga\" (a remixed version of the album track) followed.\nIn 2004, Echobelly released a fifth album, again through their own Fry Up label, Gravity Pulls (produced by Ian Grimble).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Over the years, several other members of Ministry played with Lard, namely Bill Rieflin, Mike Scaccia, and Rey Washam.\nLike most of Biafra's work, Lard's songs are angrily political (the War on Drugs is a particularly common theme) but often have a tinge of humor.\n\nLard has not officially toured and has only performed live a handful of times, mostly around the San Francisco area (where Jello lives and operates his Alternative Tentacles record label). The band played during Ministry's 1988 tour and throughout their 1989\u20131990 dates, once in Chicago after wrapping the recording of The Last Temptation of Reid, once at the conclusion of a Ministry concert in Los Angeles (March 24, 2003), and at the San Francisco (September 26, 2004), Portland (September 28, 2004) and Seattle (September 29, 2004) dates of Ministry's Evil Doer tour.

Until this point, all of Led Zeppelin's albums had been released on Atlantic Records, who would distribute Swan Song. The album was first announced to the press on 6 November with a planned release date of 29 November and an accompanying US tour (the band's tenth) starting in January. Delays in the production of the album's sleeve design prevented its release prior to the commencement of the tour. It was finally released on 24 February 1975.\n\nThe album was a commercial and critical success, having built up a huge advance order following the delayed release date, and when eventually issued it reached No. 1 in the UK charts. In the US, it debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, rising to No. 1 the following week and staying there for six weeks.  Physical Graffiti has since proven to be one of the most popular releases by the group, shipping 8 million copies in the United States. It was the first album to go platinum on advance orders alone. Shortly after its release, all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart.The group debuted several songs from Physical Graffiti live at a warm-up gig in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on 11 January, a week before the US tour, which lasted until 27 March. The tour was also successful, and was followed up by a series of shows at Earl's Court, London. Tickets for the shows sold out within four hours, described by promoter Mel Bush as \"unprecedented demand in the history of rock music\", so a further two dates were added. The shows attracted rave reviews, and critics noted the band enjoyed playing the new material on Physical Graffiti more than the older songs.NME's Nick Kent reviewed the album three months before it was released. He speculated it could be the group's best work to date, saying \"the album's tonal density is absolutely the toughest, most downright brutal I've heard all year\". In March 1975, Billboard magazine's reviewer wrote: \"[Physical Graffiti] is a tour de force through a number of musical styles, from straight rock to blues to folky acoustic to orchestral sounds.\" Similarly, Jim Miller stated in Rolling Stone that the double album was \"the band's Tommy, Beggar's Banquet and Sgt. Pepper rolled into one: Physical Graffiti is Led Zeppelin's bid for artistic respectability\". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau maintained his long-held ambivalence regarding Led Zeppelin, writing that except for side two, the material often wanders into \"wide tracks, misconceived opi, and so forth\", and \"after a while Robert Plant begins to grate\".In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it at number 70 on the magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". It was re-ranked at number 73 in a 2012 revised list, and re-ranked at number 144 in 2020.Plant later felt that Physical Graffiti represented the band at its creative peak, and has since said that it is his favourite Led Zeppelin album.

In the UK, the album peaked at number 29.\nWorking titles for the album included Reverberation, Add Some Music, and The Fading Rock Group Revival. The recording sessions began in January 1969, and, after a year-long search for a new record contract, completed in July 1970. In contrast to 20/20, the record featured a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members. About four dozen songs were written for the album, and the label rejected numerous revisions of its track listing before the band presented enough formidable material deemed satisfactory for release. It includes \"This Whole World\", one of Brian Wilson's most complex songs, \"Forever\", regarded as among Dennis Wilson's finest, and \"Cool, Cool Water\", a song that originated from the band's Smile sessions.\n\nFans generally consider Sunflower to be the Beach Boys' finest post-Pet Sounds album.

{"id": "264_254", "question": "What music label is True Blue represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_53209", "text": "True Blue was generally well received by critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it was \"one of the great dance-pop albums\", that showcases Madonna's skills as a \"songwriter, record-maker, provocateur, and entertainer through its wide reach, accomplishment, and sheer sense of fun\". This opinion was echoed by the staff of Billboard, who were impressed with the \"confident\" album, and the singer's growth as writer and producer. Erika Wexler from Spin wrote: \"Madonna knows her days as the chanteuse for teenage romance are numbered. With perfect timing, [she] gently distanced herself from that role, and although some of the songs [on True Blue] have the sophistication of a training bra, there are glowing moments\". The New York Times' Stephen Holden noted that, despite lacking the \"gleaming ultra-sleek aural surfaces\" of Like a Virgin, True Blue's made up of \"shrewdly crafted teen-age and pre-teen-age ditties that reveal Madonna's unfailing commercial instincts\", and find her singing with \"a lot more heart\". This opinion was shared by Rolling Stone, where Davitt Sigerson referred to True Blue as a \"sturdy, dependable, lovable\" album, and singled out the singer's voice for sounding \"better than ever\".Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times, pointed out that the \"most obvious growth\" was Madonna's voice, which is \"so finely tailored that she actually extends the punch and appeal of the production touches\". He went on to say: \"True Blue isn't revolutionary music, but it is imaginative, highly energized pop that recognizes the limitations and pleasures of Top 40 fare\". PopMatters' Peter Piatkowski also applauded the singer's more mature vocals, and deemed the record \"brilliant, one that speaks to its time but also celebrates the disparate cultures that influence [Madonna's] sound at the moment\". True Blue is the \"most polished\" of Madonna's first three albums, according to El Hunt from the Evening Standard. In the same vein, Mary Von Aue from Stereogum said it has \"more vocal range and lyrical complexities\" than Like a Virgin and Madonna. True Blue was hailed \"nine tracks of 80s pop perfection [...] Madonna\u2019s strongest effort from that decade\" by the staff of Gay Times. For Joseph Earp from Australian website Junkee, \"with its era-defining production, and sweaty sheen of subversion, [True Blue is] the singer's way of understanding everything that came afterwards [...] most pop singers never release a record this good in their whole career\".Lucy O'Brien pointed out that, whereas her debut and Like a Virgin were a \"sound in development\", True Blue sees Madonna \"nail[ing] her signature style - rhythmic, dramatic, danceable, and distinctively melodic\". Replacing Nile Rodgers with Leonard and Bray resulted in a \"less polished, but more varied\" album, according to The Sunday Telegraph's Larry Nager. The review ended on a somewhat critical note: True Blue is \"classic pop [...] an entertaining album's worth of catchy, danceable tunes\", despite \"not much content beneath the candy-coating\", concluded Nager. Despite naming it a \"supreme archetype of '80s pop music\", with its tracks being \"undeniably more mature\" than her previous endeavors, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani felt True Blue was home to \"some of [Madonna's] biggest clunkers\", and is \"undeniably of its time\". To Karen Cooke from Australian newspaper The Age, even though it includes a couple of \"tedious\" tracks, \"this record is full of songs to make you tap the steering wheel [and] dance in the loungeroom\". True Blue's main flaw is that its five singles are \"so strong they overshadow\" the rest of the tracks, which seem \"slight by comparison\", wrote Daryl Easlea.In less favorable reviews, John Quayle from the Observer\u2013Reporter dismissed the record as \"warmed over Go-Gos material\", but applauded the singles for being \"strong enough to convince even her worst critics that Madonna does have talent - and lots of it\". Mary Von Aue noted that the album experiments with \"different sounds that are well executed as singles\", but as a whole sounds \"disjointed\", concluding that, \"[True Blue] doesn\u2019t live up to the strength of [its singles]\". For Don McLeese from the Chicago Sun-Times, although it represents a \"valiant -and necessary- attempt on Madonna's part to expand her artistic range, True Blue just isn't as much fun\" as her previous records. The Record-Journal's Jim Zebora was also negative: \"[True Blue] contains one absolutely marvelous torch song called 'Live To Tell' [...] Unfortunately, the rest is barely competent post-disco [...] So let's call it a C plus and program the CD player to ignore eight out of [its] nine songs\". Finally, Larry Kilman, writing for American newspaper The Evening News, compared it negatively to the work of girl groups such as the Ronettes and the Shangri-Las, dismissing it as \"mindless, inspid [and] air-headed\", adding that, \"[its] slick production and arrangements disguise much of the tininess of [Madonna's] voice [...] But that's as good as [True Blue] gets\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

This is evident in their first two albums, Forgiven, Not Forgotten and Talk on Corners, although Andrea described the genre of Talk on Corners by saying \"it [has] got more of an edgy feel, a little bit more guitar-orientated and also an Irish sound, which is in Forgiven, Not Forgotten.\"In Blue moved towards mainstream pop, placing heavy emphasis on synthesizers. The move attracted criticism from many; one Entertainment Weekly critic called it \"a disheartening example of musical ethnic cleansing\". A USA Today critic called it \"the best mainstream pop album you're likely to come across\".Borrowed Heaven placed heavier emphasis on guitars, while retaining the original folk rock genre.

White Light returned to a similar sound to In Blue, with much more electronic-based instrumentation, while Jupiter Calling is characterised as a more stripped back live performance with minimal overdubbing.\nThe Corrs' main influences were their parents who were musicians and encouraged them to learn instruments.

{"id": "264_261", "question": "What music label is Master P represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_53240", "text": "Aside from being a rapper, Master P has enjoyed a successful career as an entrepreneur and investor. Miller opened a record store in Richmond, California called No Limit Records, which later became the foundation for his own record label of the same name.Miller was one of the first rappers to notice and take advantage of the retail potential of the music industry. As an investor, Master P was one of the first rappers to build a business and financial empire by investing in a wide range of business and investment ventures from a variety of industries. He has since invested the millions of dollars he made from his No Limit record company into a travel agency, a Foot Locker retail outlet, real estate, stocks, film, music, and television production, toy making, clothing, telecommunications, a jewellery line, auto accessories, book and magazine publishing, car rims, fast food franchises, and gas stations. His sports management agency No Limit Communications, a joint venture with marketing guru Djuan Edgerton, was a success. His conglomerate company, No Limit Enterprises became a financial powerhouse. His real estate investment and property management company, the New Orleans-based PM Properties controls over 100 properties across the United States. According to Black Enterprise magazine, No Limit Enterprises grossed $110 million in revenue in 1998 alone. This level of success inspired other rappers to branch out into other business ventures and investments. Miller also has his own line of beverages called \"Make 'Em Say Ughh!\" energy drinks. Miller has also made a foray into mass media, where he founded Better Black Television, a cable television network in November 2010 based in New Orleans, making him the first rapper to establish a cable television network.Rappers had historically focused more on the artistic and glamorous side of hip hop music while paying very little attention to the business, investment, and financial aspects. All that changed in 1996 when Master P signed a music distribution deal with Priority Records, one where No Limit Records would retain 100% ownership of their master recordings and keep 85% of their record's sales while giving Priority 15% in return for pressing and distribution which allows No Limit to profit from future sales such as catalogs and reissues. Master P went on to make hundreds of millions of dollars from this deal. Additionally, Master P invented many innovative marketing techniques. According to Wendy Day, CEO of the Rap Coalition, \"Master P had a whole marketing movement. He was the first person to market the way a corporate entity like IBM would market to their clientele.\" Whereas the traditional model for marketing records was to spend millions of dollars on expensive videos and air play, Miller did not have such a luxury. As an independent artist, Miller had to find a way to sell, market and build platinum record selling demand on a limited recording budget. He was known for keeping upfront business expenses down and profit margins high. He began selling tapes out the trunk of his car in every city and town in America where there was potential demand for his music. He gave out free samples to people with expensive cars and had them playing his music throughout their neighborhoods. This street level guerrilla marketing technique set the foundation to build a larger fanbase for the future. After signing his deal with Priority, Miller began a high volume business model of cranking out as many records as possible, as frequently as possible. He branded all his albums, so that the No Limit brand became more important than the actual artist's name. Miller cross-promoted all his artists and albums inside the album covers. He also used pen and pixel graphics and Mafia-inspired themes to make his albums stand out using Photoshop. He offered 20 songs per album, whereas most albums offered 15 or less, as Miller learned that customers wanted more for their money. He turned his artists into Marvel comic book-like characters rather than just rappers. He made sure his artists were number one on SoundScan every time they released an album, to build the perception of popularity. He used inexpensive videos to promote his artists and he cross-promoted albums using films and vice versa and tied them altogether as a package. Brand image and identity became more important than just music quality. Miller's record labels have sold 75 million records as a result of his innovative marketing and branding strategies.As founder and CEO of No Limit Entertainment, Miller at one time presided over a business empire that included his conglomerate No Limit Enterprises, No Limit Records, Bout It Inc., No Limit Clothing, No Limit Communications, No Limit Films, No Limit Sports Management, P. M. Properties, and Advantage Travel. Miller represented former NFL running back Ricky Williams when he was drafted by the New Orleans Saints; however, the deal was rated the worst contract for a player in NFL History by ESPN. Miller manages the music, film, and television career of his son, Romeo Miller, as well as pop star Forrest Lipton and Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane. Miller was the executive television producer for his teenage daughter Cymphonique's Nickelodeon Show, How To Rock, and the co-creator of Romeo!, the hit Nickelodeon television show that stars his son.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His father worked as a truck driver and also played trumpet and sang in local bands. Freddy grew up listening to the rhythm and blues music of Big Joe Turner, Buddy Johnson and others on the radio, and he learned to play guitar.  After attending Lynn Vocation High School, he made his recording debut as a singer in 1958, singing and playing rhythm guitar on a single, \"Cha-Cha-Do\" by the Spindrifts, which became a local hit.  He had also played lead guitar on a session for an R&B vocal group, the G-Clefs, whose record \"Ka-Ding Dong\" made No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1956. At a young age he joined the National Guard, took a job driving a truck, married, and became a father.Inspired musically by Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little Richard, he formed his own group, Freddy Karmon & the Hurricanes, which became increasingly popular in the Boston area, and began to develop a trademark strained singing style.  He also became a regular on a local TV dance show, Boston Ballroom, and, in 1958, signed up to a management contract with Boston disc jockey Jack McDermott.  With lyrics written by his mother, he prepared a new song which he called \"Rock and Roll Baby\", and he produced a demo which McDermott took to the writing and production team of Bob Crewe and Frank Slay.  They rearranged the song, rewrote the lyrics, and offered to produce a recording in return for two-thirds of the composing credits. The first recording of the song, now titled \"Tallahassee Lassie\", with a guitar solo by session musician Kenny Paulson, was rejected by several record companies, but was then heard by TV presenter Dick Clark who part-owned Swan Records in Philadelphia. \nClark suggested that the song be re-edited and overdubbed to add excitement, by highlighting the pounding bass drum sound and adding hand claps and Freddy's cries of \"whoo!\", which later became one of his trademarks. The single was finally released by Swan Records, with the company president, Bernie Binnick, suggesting Freddy's new stage name of \"Freddy Cannon\". After being promoted and becoming successful in Boston and Philadelphia, the single gradually received national airplay.  In 1959, it peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first of his 22 songs to appear on the Billboard chart, and also reached No. 13 on the R&B singles chart. In the UK, where his early records were issued on the Top Rank label, it reached No. 17. \"Tallahassee Lassie\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.\nHe stayed on the Swan label with producer Frank Slay for the next five years and became known as Freddy \"Boom Boom\" Cannon for the thumping power of his recordings. Dick Clark brought him national exposure through his numerous appearances on his television program, American Bandstand - a record of 110 appearances in total.  In the words of writer Cub Koda:\"Freddy Cannon was a true believer, a rocker to the bone. Freddy Cannon made rock & roll records; great noisy rock & roll records, and all of them were infused with a gigantic drum beat that was an automatic invitation to shake it on down anyplace there was a spot to dance.\"\nHis second single \"Okefenokee\" (credited to Freddie Cannon, as were several of his other records) only made No. 43 on the charts, but the next record, \"Way Down Yonder In New Orleans\", a rocked-up version of a 1922 song, became a gold record and reached No. 3 in the pop charts in both the US and the UK, where it was the biggest of his hits. It also sold over one million copies.  Cannon toured in Britain and, in March 1960, his album The Explosive Freddy Cannon became the first album by a rock and roll singer to top the UK Albums Chart. For the next two years, until early 1962, he continued to have lesser chart hits in the US, in some cases with versions of old standards including \"Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy\" and Edward \"Kid\" Ory's \"Muskrat Ramble\".  His hits also included \"Twistin' All Night Long\", recorded with Danny & the Juniors and also featuring Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons on backing vocals. However, one of his biggest hits came in May 1962 with \"Palisades Park\", written by future TV Gong Show host Chuck Barris. Produced by Slay with overdubbed rollercoaster sound effects, it reached No. 3 on the Hot 100, No. 15 on the R&B chart, and No. 20 in the UK. This release also sold over one million copies, gaining gold disc status.Cannon also appeared with Bobby Vee, Johnny Tillotson and others, in the movie Just for Fun, made in the UK in 1962.  Although his popularity in the US faded, he remained a popular touring act in Britain and elsewhere in the world for some years.  In 1963, he signed for Warner Bros. Records where he recorded his last two US top twenty hits, \"Abigail Beecher\" (No. 16) in 1964 and the following year \"Action\" (No. 13), from Dick Clark's TV show Where the Action Is, which he recorded with top Los Angeles session musicians including Leon Russell, James Burton, Glen Campbell, and David Gates. \"Action\" got a fourth gold disc for Cannon. Also in 1965, Slay acquired Cannon's Swan recordings and sold them to Warner Bros.\nHe appeared, along with the Beau Brummels, in Village of the Giants, a teen movie with early film appearances by Beau Bridges and Ron Howard, and played himself, performing one of his songs, in the final episode of the teen soap opera, Never Too Young, on 24 June 1966. \nAfter leaving Warner Bros. Records in 1967, Cannon released singles on several labels, including Sire, Royal American, Metromedia, MCA, Andee, Claridge, Horn, and Amherst. In the 1970s he recorded and became a promotional man for Buddah Records, but returned to the lower reaches of the charts in 1981 with \"Let's Put the Fun Back in Rock'n'Roll,\" recorded with the Belmonts for MiaSound Records and in 1982 appeared in the independent movie, The Junkman.  Thereafter, he continued to work with Dick Clark at his Bandstand reunion concerts and to tour all over the world.  In 2002, he released an album of seasonal songs, Have A Boom Boom Christmas!!A resident of Tarzana, California, Cannon continues to put on performances at assorted concert venues. He has complete control and ownership of his Swan and Warner Bros. masters.One notable fan of Cannon's was the late Box Tops and Big Star singer Alex Chilton; Chilton reportedly had a portrait of Cannon hanging on the wall of his home in New Orleans and had once offered the following comment about Cannon to a friend: \"Freddy Cannon\u2019s shows always worked, because he moved through life with ease.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He wrote barely a dozen major works in his career, destroyed much of his early music and often revised what he had written. His early work was clearly derivative of Ravel, Debussy and Roussel; but his later music, though influenced by Bartok and Stravinsky, was entirely original and often seemed\u2014in its scale\u2014more German than French.\" The Daily Telegraph's critic Philip Hensher called Dutilleux \"the Laura Ashley of music; tasteful, unfaultable, but hardly ever daring ...

{"id": "264_285", "question": "What music label is The Family That Plays Together represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27485", "text": "Various readings of what the situation in Words and Music might represent have emerged from critical studies of the work:\n\nVivian Mercier treats the three characters as separate beings, Croak being an \"old man who shuffles in\" asking Words and Music to be friends.\nEugene Webb suggests that \"Croak is the name the dialogue directions give to the conscious self of the artist\".\nCharles Lyons says that \"[i]n Words and Music Beckett provides three characters who seem to represent different psychic functions of a single consciousness \u2026 [however] Beckett does not integrate them into the image of a specific, whole person.\" Also a number of times Lyons hints at the autobiographical nature of the piece though without providing any real evidence. It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent even though, at the time, she was more interested in going into A&R and hoped to launch other people's careers.\nFour months after graduation, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and given it to a friend. The friend posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to a phone call from Richard Russell, boss of the music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting.Nick Huggett, at XL, recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management, and in June 2006, Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major draw for Adele, a big fan of the British singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL in September 2006. \nAdele provided vocals for Jack Pe\u00f1ate's song, \"My Yvonne\", for his debut album Matin\u00e9e, and it was during this session she first met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce both the majority of her debut album, 19, and tracks on 21. \nAdele recorded a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love\" on the recommendation of her manager Jonathan Dickins, who loved the song.The first single released from 19 was \"Chasing Pavements\", which Adele wrote in collaboration with Eg White. \n\"Chasing Pavements\" was inspired by an incident Adele had with a former boyfriend of six months. After learning he had cheated on her, she went to the bar he was at and punched him in the face. After being thrown out, Adele walked down the street alone and thought to herself, \"What is it you're chasing? You're chasing an empty pavement.\" She sang and recorded it on her mobile phone and arranged the chords when she got home. \nAdele and White co-wrote two other songs for the album: \"Melt My Heart to Stone\" and \"Tired\".

I was brought up on Stevie Wonder and I love Talking Book and all the overdubs on it, and all that freestyling Marvin Gaye thing. I'd always wanted to make a record like that, and this was the first one I produced so that's probably why I went 'Fuck it I'm just going to do it'.\" The NME felt that the album's \"retro-garage\" style made it \"accidentally hip,\" comparing it to acclaimed contemporary garage rock revival \"headbanger blues\" bands like the White Stripes, a sentiment also shared by music critic Neil McCormick.Throughout the album there are \"different moods and changes.\" Jones stated: \"Every few bars, when your brain's saying, 'Have you heard that now', I wanted to put something new in there.\" He felt this set the album apart from most other contemporary albums, which he felt \"sound like one song from beginning to end.\" Jack Smith of the BBC detected influences from AC/DC, Stevie Wonder, the Isley Brothers and Creedence Clearwater Revival. The album also sporadically features \"ornate strings reminiscent of Chris Farlowe's British soul in the 1960s.\" Jones' emotional lyrics for the albums draw on his break-up with his girlfriend of 12 years, and one critic noted how Jones' \"life unfolds through words\" on the album. Jones said of the lyrics:\n\n\"The songwriting has changed because as a person you change. It's been an emotional rollercoaster these last two years, whether it be divorce, sex, drink, drugs, arguments, whatever it might be, I can only write about what I'm experiencing. Life is about making mistakes and learning from them, learning about yourself and becoming a better person. That's what the title of the album basically means.\"\nThe opening song, \"Help Me (She's Out of Her Mind)\", has been described as \"easy funk\", and comparisons were drawn between Jones' vocals on the song and John Lennon's \"Cold Turkey\" vocals. Jason MacNeil of PopMatters compared the \"moody, murky blues rock\" song to Southern soul, while describing \"Maybe Tomorrow\" as \"English soul.\" Lead single \"Madame Helga\" has been described as gospel and glam metal, with \"dirty guitars duplicating a funky brass section.\" The acoustic, country-styled \"Climbing the Wall\" features horn and string sections and a Southern rock guitar solo, while the \"pseudo-experimentalism\" of \"I'm Alright (You Gotta Go There To Come Back)\" features looped drums and a piano.

Aaron Hale-Williams, a writer for the online publication Racket Magazine, was given a password-encoded streaming media version of the album by Fat Wreck Chords so that he could publish a review prior to its release. Hale posted the password and a link to the album stream on the music news website Punknews.org, and the album soon spread onto peer-to-peer networks after the streaming audio was converted into MP3 format. Racket Magazine Editor Jonathan Yost learned of the leak from Hale and contacted Fat Wreck Chords: \"He called me to tell me how good it was, and mentioned that he gave it to 'two or three' people. I scoped it on PunkNews and saw that it was all over the place, so [I] dropped Fat a line to change the password before it got too far out of control.\" Meanwhile, Hale had been submitting samples of his writing to Scott Heisel, Music Editor for Alternative Press and former editor for Punknews.org. Heisel had been covering news of Civil War's recording and development for Alternative Press and learned of the album leak, which he called \"illegal...immoral and immature.\" He contacted Fat Wreck Chords to inform them of the situation at about the same time as Yost, and learned that the Hale was the suspected source of the leak:\n\nWhen I asked a friend who worked for Fat where they think the leak came from, they pinpointed it to one specific person from a specific magazine (again, not AP) who had been begging them to hear the record. Upon hearing this person's name, I realized that same person had been emailing and IMing me incessantly for the past few weeks about trying to write for AP...Once I found out the label was holding him responsible for the leak, I promptly wrote him and let him know that AP doesn't use writers who leak records, so I would not need his services.\n\nYost subsequently fired Hale from Racket Magazine, explaining that \"it was very obvious that this was a giant fuck up on our homeslice\u2019s part. So...it was my decision to fire Aaron from Racket.\" Hale responded with his version of events on his blog:\n\nI'm sorry for whom I hurt [at Fat Wreck Chords], but the truth is...I did my job, in a roundabout way. I got people, in a way, really hyperventilating about a band that's been dormant for nearly a decade. In the terms of underground music...that's nearly impossible, with so many bands worthy of attention falling on and off the radar nearly daily. Not that this particular band needs any help, but with years and years of taunting new releases, new music, and then shooting them down, it became a game of \"band who cried album.\"\n\nIn the wake of the controversy artist Mitch Clem published a six-part comic strip satirizing the events in his webcomic Nothing Nice to Say. He received an email from the album's producer Dave Gardener criticizing his satire of the situation: \"As the guy who recorded the record I have to say I found your attempt at social commentary via satire was pretty weak and actually fairly insulting. If you had any idea of the work that all of us, the band, the other guy who did the record and honestly the label put into making the record happen you might have an inkling over how shitty the leaking of the record is to us all.\" Clem responded that the comic was actually intended to oppose music piracy, not to advocate it. Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that \"It sucks that Mr. Hale\u2019s decision to share the album with his friends turned out this way. But he is directly responsible for the leak and needs to accept accountability for his actions. You can\u2019t place the blame on everyone but you because they were forced to react to your initial actions.\" Punknews.org posted a synopsis of the controversy, stating that \"Punknews.org does not support or condone leaking albums. It's not just about the commerce; there are many people who work on an album like this one, it is fair for people to at least be compensated for the time they took away from other jobs, families and friends in order to put together an album for you.\"In an interview with Dillinger Four singer/guitarist Erik Funk for Alternative Press on the day before the album's release, Heisel asked what Funk thought of the controversy surrounding Civil War's online leak. Funk replied that the band members do not have a strong stance on the issue and were surprised at the controversy:\n\nWe were surprised to see it become as big--I mean, the story became way bigger than our part in it. Or it wasn't really about our record. It was just about that circumstance. For us, none of us have a real strong position against people sharing music. I mean, I think that's fine.

As performed on In Color, the song starts with Nielsen playing a frenzied, fuzzy guitar part for two and a half bars, then Bun E. Carlos' strong drum beat appears, and finally Tom Petersson's bass and Robin Zander's vocal join in. The entire song lasts 1 minute and 41 seconds.  Annie Zaleski of Ultimate Classic Rock described it as having \"razor-edge riffs, a frenzied drum solo and ragged exhortations of 'Would you like to do a number with me?'\" Cheap Trick also released the song on its compilation albums Sex, America, Cheap Trick and The Essential Cheap Trick. A live video of Cheap Trick performing \"Hello There\" at the Budokan concert was shown on the DVD included with the 30th anniversary collector's edition release of Cheap Trick at Budokan album.Critic Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone detected echoes in the song of the \"manic verve\" of The Beatles' song \"Birthday\".

Rather than use one of their more melodic songs to experiment with the sound coming out of the PA system, they could use this song, which Nielsen called a \"perfect welcome to the show intro piece.\" Nielsen said he got the idea for such an intro song from an earlier band, Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera. \"Hello There\" replaced \"ELO Kiddies\" as Cheap Trick's live opening song.

After trying his luck in Los Angeles for five years, McCarthy came back to Chicago in 1984, changed his name to Billy Dior, and founded The Chicago Molls together with Desi Rexx and Lizzy Valentine. The band played hard rock and glam rock. After rehearsing for about a year and performing in The Limelight nightclub in the style of the New York Dolls\u2014even sporting lingerie\u2014the band later toned down this approach when they relocated to Los Angeles at Dior's urging; he found the city to be the best place to pursue a recording contract. Guitarist S. Scot (\"S.S.\") Priest was still under contract with his other band Diamond Rexx, so he could not follow the band there, and instead was replaced by Sean Freehill.Two weeks after arriving in Los Angeles, while the band was recording demos  in a recording studio, they decided to have a few drinks at a pub down the street. There, they met two girls who were friends with an A&R person, and brought the girls back to the studio with them. When the A&R person came looking for the girls, the bandmates played their demos for him. Although seemingly disinterested at first, he agreed to try and get them a recording contract. Eight months later, the band, now under the name D'Molls, signed a contract with Atlantic Records, with Priest rejoining the band at this time.  Two years later, they released their debut album, D'Molls. The video for \"777\" received some airplay on MTV, but album sales failed to prosper. In 1990, the band released their second and final album on the Atlantic label, Warped. Featuring tracks \"Real Love\" and \"Father Time\", it combined simple sounding musical patterns with varying beat speeds. However, vocalist Rexx quit D'Molls and joined The David Lee Roth Band before the album's promotion campaign even got off the ground, and the group disbanded shortly thereafter. They did not release another album until 1996, when Delinquent Records featured the group's third and final album, Beyond D'Valley Of D'Molls, which featured three live tracks as well as previously unreleased studio recordings. There also exists a best of compilation CD, The Best of Everything, which came out in 2007. In 2011 Rexx released Desi Rexx's D'Moll's \"D'Sides\" on FnA Records.Dior and Valentine permanently left D'Molls in 1990 after the band officially disbanded.In 2004, Dior published a thriller novel under his birth name, Billy McCarthy, The Devil of Shakespeare, inspired in part by his experiences with the band and the 1980s Los Angeles glam rock scene. In 2015, he sued Poison for copyright infringement on several Poison hit songs, including, \"Talk Dirty To Me,\" for which the band failed to credit him as co-writer. Dior had played with Poison guitarist C.C. Deville when both were members of Kid Rocker and Screamin' Mimis. Poison ultimately settled with Dior out of court for an undeclared sum. In 2017, McCarthy published his sophomore effort at writing, Beat Me Till I'm Famous, an autobiographical memoir of his rags to rags experience as a professional musician in the 1980s, most of which covers the entire D'Molls story.\nIn 2018, Rexx reformed the band with Jonni Lightfoot (Air Supply 2001 - 2016) under the new name D'Molls 777, in homage to their song \"777\".

The New York Times columnist Jeff Leeds noted that the releases could benefit from the holiday season, but \"it could also hinder their efforts to establish themselves as recording artists with distinctive personalities and the legitimacy needed for long careers.\" Clive Davis reiterated that the release was intended to recede from their ties from American Idol, saying, \"I'm not interested in merely souvenir sales\". The album was titled Breakaway to capitalize on the success of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement soundtrack single \"Breakaway\", which was also reissued as the album's final single. Immediately before the album was released, Clarkson left 19 Management, dismissed Fuller as her manager, and quickly hired the managing services of Jeff Kwatinetz of The Firm, though still contracted to 19 Recordings. A promotion plan was created for Clarkson for Breakaway's release. Davis positioned her to be RCA's top global priority, and at the recommendation of The Firm, removed American Idol from her official biography. Rather than being booked on arenas for her tour, Kwatinetz booked Clarkson for smaller amphitheaters to hone her performance skills. He remarked, \"American Idol gave her a lot of exposure that allowed her to skip some steps in her development, and that's hazardous.\" Breakaway was first released internationally on January 3, 2005, by the Bertelsmann Music Group (now Sony Music Entertainment), and was released in the United Kingdom on July 18, 2005, by RCA. In November 2005, a special edition CD+DVD was released, containing additional bonus tracks and music videos.Clarkson, along with Studdard and Barrino, hosted a television musical special on the Fox Broadcasting Company entitled Kelly, Ruben & Fantasia: Home for Christmas on November 25, 2004. On the eve of Breakaway's release, she performed \"Since U Been Gone\" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. In February 2005, she appeared on Saturday Night Live to perform \"Since U Been Gone\" and \"Breakaway\". In September 2005, she appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and performed \"Breakaway\" as well as \"Because of You\". Clarkson also performed in award ceremonies and events; she performed \"Since U Been Gone\" on the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards at the American Airlines Arena and on the Brit Awards 2006 at the Earls Court. She performed \"Because of You\" on the 48th Annual Grammy Awards at the Staples Center and on the 15th Echo Awards at the Estrel Hotel.From 2005 to 2006, Clarkson embarked on three concert tours to promote Breakaway: the Breakaway Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and the Addicted Tour. The Breakaway Tour, which took place before, in between and after the Hazel Eyes Tour, marked Clarkson's first world tour, visiting theaters and arenas throughout North America, Europe and Oceania. The Hazel Eyes tour took place in various theaters throughout North America, with the concert at UCF Arena being streamed live on AOL and AOL Radio. Upon returning to the United States, she then embarked on the Addicted Tour, performing at various amphitheaters across the United States.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He enjoyed music from a young age, playing harmonica and guitar with his childhood friends.\nWhen he was 10, he suffered from severe polio which gave him little control over his left hand and restricted use of his right. He had been playing guitar prior to his polio and decided to continue despite his handicap, which led to his development of the butter knife method.Once he sufficiently mastered his variation on slide guitar  playing, Davis began playing in various nightclubs across the Mississippi Delta area.  He played with Robert Nighthawk for a ten-year period from 1953 to 1963.  While playing in a club in 1957, a police raid caused the crowd to stampede over Davis. Both of his legs were broken in this incident and he was forced to use a wheelchair from that time onwards.  The hardships resulting from his physical handicaps were a major influence on his lyrics and style of blues playing.\nDavis moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas in the early 1960s and continued his artistic work.  In recent times, Davis' music has been released by the Fat Possum Records label to much critical acclaim.  His 1994 album, produced by Robert Palmer, Feel Like Doin' Something Wrong, received a 9.0 from Pitchfork Media, which called it \"timeless.\"\nThe Best Of CeDell Davis (1995) was also released, with help from Col.

The label, which is actually the second incarnation (the first Universal Records was a short-lived underground imprint of MCA Records that existed from 1988 to 1989) was created by former Universal Music Group chairman and CEO Doug Morris and Daniel Glass (founder of Glassnote Records), who became its president.\nIn 1996, to complement the MCA renaming into Universal, MCA Music Entertainment Group was also rebranded into what is known today as Universal Music Group. With that in place, Universal Records was to operate under the newly renamed UMG banner.Universal Records had success in breaking new artists, including the multi-platinum debut of Erykah Badu, Billie Myers, Goldfinger, Akon and the Lost Boyz. Glass formed relationships with independent record labels such as Kedar Entertainment and Mojo Records. Universal also brought in and took over Uptown Records following founder Andre Harrell's departure. Following Heavy D's dropping from the imprint in 1997, Universal folded Uptown in 1999.New Orleans, Louisiana based record company Cash Money Records, led by Ronald \"Slim\" Williams and Bryan \"Baby/Birdman\" Williams, signed a three-year $30 million distribution deal with Universal Records in March 1998. Under the terms of the deal, the Williams were given a $3 million advance each year and a credit of $1.5 million for each of the up to six artists that they had at the time. After recouping, Universal Records would retain 15% of profits from album sales, while Cash Money retained 85% as well as ownership of all master recordings. Cash Money's first success under Universal was Juvenile's November 1998 release, 400 Degreez. The album peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 and would ultimately go on to be certified quadruple platinum in the United States. Cash Money and Universal also launched Lil Wayne's career with his November 1999 album Tha Block Is Hot, which was a top three Billboard 200 album and later certified platinum in America.On December 10, 1998, Seagram completed its seven-month $10.6 billion plan to acquire PolyGram, merging its music division of labels with UMG, helping both divisions combine operations together under the biggest music recording company. On New Year's Eve 1998, Universal Records was pooled together with then-PolyGram label Motown Records and fellow MCA label Republic Records to form Universal Motown Republic Group; Motown was previously brought under UMG during its preceding days as MCA Inc. It was a subsidiary of MCA Records and was minority-owned by Boston Ventures until 1991. To start the New Year in 1999, Universal Motown Republic Group became one of the three new music units under UMG alongside Interscope Geffen A&M Records and The Island Def Jam Music Group.In 2001, after the absorption of Priority Records into EMI, No Limit Records was signed a distribution deal with Universal and renamed \"The New No Limit\". However, this deal failed as various releases by Master P, Romeo, 504 Boyz and Choppa did not meet commercial expectations. No Limit cut ties with Universal in 2004, a year after filing for bankruptcy.Bad Boy Entertainment, founded by Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs, signed a three-year marketing and distribution deal with Universal Records in February 2003, following its departure from Arista Records. Universal and Bad Boy released Da Band's September 2003 album, Too Hot for TV. The album was ultimately certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Albums under this deal that followed include the soundtrack to Bad Boys II, Loon's self-titled album, Carl Thomas' Let's Talk About It, Mario Winans' Hurt No More and New Edition's One Love. In 2005, Bad Boy switched distribution from Universal to Atlantic Records before the deal could be fulfilled.The label later had more success with acts like 3 Doors Down, 98 Degrees, Chamillionaire, Godsmack, Mushroomhead, Flaw, Hatebreed, Lifer, Jack Johnson, Juvenile, Nelly, Big Sha, Lil Wayne, and Mika. In the summer of 2004, Universal had a big success with Terror Squad's single, \"Lean Back\", which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 that August.By 2005, Universal was reaching its downfall, even though Cash Money kept its prophecy leading, but its success was short-lived. On New Year's Eve 2005, Universal Records was merged with Republic Records to become Universal Republic Records. Motown (as a standalone label) was renamed Universal Motown Records. Therefore, artists under Motown, as well as hip hop and R&B acts under Universal were combined together under Universal Motown, with the rest being transferred to Universal Republic, which would later be reverted back to Republic Records in 2012, a year after Universal Motown was changed back to Motown, which itself would be moved to Island Def Jam. As a result, the Universal Motown Republic Group was disbanded in the summer of 2011 during a reorganization at Universal Music Group, which was under the leadership of Lucian Grainge.It was also the distributor of Polydor and Island UK in the United States. Distribution switched to Interscope Geffen A&M Records and Republic Records respectively after the label's dissolution. Island's operation in the United Kingdom, in 2013, would be absorbed into Virgin EMI Records would itself would be rebranded in 2020 as EMI Records, taking over distribution for Republic UK.\nAs of December 2023, Universal Records is currently inactive as its artists would later be drafted to Republic Records. Motown is currently under the Capitol Music Group, which it has been a part of since 2014 following another UMG disbandment of the Island Def Jam Music Group. Therefore, reissues of releases under the Universal Records, Universal Republic or Universal Motown names will be handled by Republic and Motown respectively on behalf of Universal Music Enterprises.\nThere have been unrelated Universal Records labels in Europe and the Philippines. Because of an unrelated label in the Philippines owning the rights to the Universal Records name in that country, parent company Universal Music Group did business there as MCA Music, Inc., using UMG's former name. In 2021, MCA Music was renamed UMG Philippines.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Worrell was later replaced by various other bassists, including Reggie Workman, Finn Von Eyben, Harold Dodson, Eddie G\u00f3mez, Steve Swallow, and Buell Neidlinger. All About Jazz reviewer Clifford Allen wrote that the group \"cut some of the most powerful music in the free jazz underground\".In November 1962, Tchicai moved from his home country of Denmark to New York City at the suggestion of Archie Shepp and Bill Dixon, whom he had met at the Helsinki Jazz Festival earlier that year. Upon arriving in New York, Tchicai began playing with Dixon's group, which included Shepp and Roswell Rudd among others, and also sat in with Don Cherry and various other musicians. By the summer of 1963, Tchicai, Shepp, and Cherry had formed the New York Contemporary Five with bassist Don Moore and drummer J. C. Moses, while Rudd, with Shepp, continued to play with Dixon. According to Rudd, the idea of forming a new quartet originated with Tchicai, and the two began playing in filmmaker Michael Snow's loft space with Moore and Moses. Moses soon left as a result of mutual dissatisfaction with his role, and Rudd and Tchicai were soon introduced to drummer Milford Graves by saxophonist Giuseppi Logan. Tchicai recalled: \"this was a very pleasant surprise and more than that, because Graves simply baffled both Rudd and I in that we, at that time, hadn't heard anybody of the younger musicians in New York that had the same sense of rhythmic cohesion in poly-rhythmics or the same sense of intensity and musicality.\" Graves \"wound up playing with them for half an hour, astonishing Rudd and Tchicai, who promptly invited him to join what became The New York Art Quartet\". Graves later stated that his invitation to join the group came \"at a time when the evolutive phases of my spiritual and creative potential were in need of being expressed without limitation\". However, Tchicai also recalled that \"bassist Don Moore became so frightened of this wizard of a percussionist that he decided that this couldn't be true or possible and, therefore, refused to play with us\", and the group brought in bassist Lewis Worrell in his place.In July 1964, Tchicai and Rudd briefly joined Albert Ayler's quartet, which consisted of Ayler, Cherry, Gary Peacock, and Sunny Murray, to record New York Eye and Ear Control, the soundtrack for a film by Michael Snow. That fall, the NYAQ, calling themselves \"The John Tchicai Quartet\", played their debut concert, participating in the \"October Revolution in Jazz\" organized by Bill Dixon. In November, the NYAQ recorded their first album as part of ESP Disk's original roster of jazz artists, and a month later they performed at the Dixon-organized festival \"Four Days in December\" as the \"Roswell Rudd - John Tchicai Quartet\", playing opposite Sun Ra at Judson Hall. The group's second album, Mohawk, was recorded in July 1965 with Reggie Workman on bass (Worrell left the group in December 1964), and was released on the Fontana label. In the fall of 1965, Tchicai lined up dates for the NYAQ in Copenhagen, Gothenburg (Sweden), Hilversum (Holland), and Amsterdam (where they opened for Ornette Coleman's group), with Finn Von Eyben playing bass and Louis Moholo playing drums as a result of scheduling issues with the original musicians. Recordings from this tour were issued on Roswell Rudd, released in 1971 without Rudd's consent, and in 2010 on the album Old Stuff. The group broke up in February 1966, with Tchicai returning to Denmark.On June 13, 1999, the NYAQ, with Workman on bass, reunited for a performance at the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, opening for Sonic Youth. Amiri Baraka, whose poem \"Black Dada Nihilismus\" was included on their debut album 35 years earlier, also appeared. The group recorded the album 35th Reunion  the following day. In 2000 they played the Paris Banlieues Blues Festival, followed by a performance at the Lisboa festival in 2001. In 2013, after Tchicai's death, Triple Point Records released a limited-edition five-LP box set, along with a 156-page coffee-table book and miscellaneous artifacts, entitled Call It Art.According to Tchicai, one of the most unique aspects of the NYAQ was \"the polyphonic part of the music that came into play; the whole collective style of playing that also existed in New Orleans Jazz and classical music. The polyphonic aspect of our music was something quite new compared to what other people were doing in contemporary jazz.\" David Toop described the group's signature sound as \"deliberately ragged, bleary themes tumbling out in spasms, notes tailing away as if lost to daydream, the music so open that total collapse seems perpetually imminent\". In his liner notes to Mohawk, Tchicai wrote: \"The important thing about our music is that it must be heard and listened to without preconceived ideas as to how jazz should sound \u2013 listen to it as MUSIC and let that be the only label!\"A documentary on the NYAQ, entitled The Breath Courses Through Us, was released in 2013 by director Alan Roth.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He used to talk about the upper partials clashing together. It was very slow moving, it was much more about sounds slowly morphing into other sounds... It was... like what you would call electroacoustic improvisation now. His trio music, even though it had bass and drums, moved at a very slow pace. It had a sort of groove, but it was very different. And he operated differently. His rhetoric was very different. I don't think he ever thought of himself as a jazz musician; he just saw himself as a musician. He was a very dignified, incredibly brilliant guy. He would never lower himself to some mere label.\" Morris added: \"He was so brilliant in the way he spoke about things; it was impossible to dismiss it as just crazy talk. Even though at first it sounded like that, over time I understood what he was talking about, and we could have conversations. He used to say it was about evolution, that if we play things we haven't heard before, it will alter the biochemistry of the brain. He said that's what evolution is about... I understand that what he was really trying to do was to move humans forward.\" Regarding Davidson's funeral, Morris stated: \"The music played by the church band circled and rose to the ceiling. The sounds clashed and blended. The partials merged. It sounded like Lowell's music.\"Taylor McLean, a musician who had met Davidson at Harvard, stated that despite Davidson's personal issues, his life was \"positive and victorious.\" He recalled that Davidson lived in an \"alternative universe\" in which he was successful: \"It is a form of success that is little understood, and that brings with it no comforts. The artist is driven to pursue and formulate successive objective forms. That is the only way to cross the river and stay alive in the current.

His distinctive style of piano playing was influenced by learning to play on an instrument that was missing some keys.He began his career in New Orleans in 1948. Mike Tessitore, owner of the Caldonia Club, gave Longhair his stage name. Longhair first recorded in a band called the Shuffling Hungarians in 1949, creating four songs (including the first version of his signature song, \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\") for the Star Talent record label. Union problems curtailed their release, but Longhair's next effort for Mercury Records the same year was a winner.  Throughout the 1950s, he recorded for Atlantic Records, Federal Records and local labels.\nProfessor Longhair had only one national commercial hit, \"Bald Head\", in 1950, under the name Roy Byrd and His Blues Jumpers. He also recorded his favorites, \"Tipitina\" and \"Go to the Mardi Gras\". He lacked crossover appeal among white and wide audiences. Yet, he is regarded (and was acknowledged) as being a musician who was highly influential for other prominent musicians, such as Fats Domino, Allen Toussaint and Dr. John.After suffering a stroke, Professor Longhair recorded \"No Buts \u2013 No Maybes\" in 1957. He re-recorded \"Go to the Mardi Gras\" in 1959. He first recorded \"Big Chief\" with its composer, Earl King, in 1964. In the 1960s, Professor Longhair's career faltered. He became a janitor to support himself and fell into a gambling habit.After a few years during which he disappeared from the music scene, Professor Longhair's musical career finally received \"a well deserved renaissance\" and wide recognition. He was invited to perform at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1971 and at the Newport Jazz Festival and the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1973. His album The London Concert showcases work he did on a visit to the United Kingdom. That significant career resurrection saw the recording of the album Professor Longhair \u2013 Live on the Queen Mary, which was recorded on March 24, 1975, during a private party hosted by Paul McCartney and Linda McCartney on board the retired RMS Queen Mary.By the 1980s his albums, such as Crawfish Fiesta on Alligator Records and New Orleans Piano on Atlantic Records, had become readily available across America. In 1974 he appeared on the PBS series Soundstage (with Dr. John, Earl King, and The Meters). In 1980 he co-starred (with Tuts Washington and Allen Toussaint) in the film documentary Piano Players Rarely Ever Play Together which was produced and directed by filmmaker Stevenson Palfi. That documentary (which aired on public television in 1982 and was rarely seen since), plus a long interview with Fess (which was recorded two days before his sudden death), were included in the 2018 released project \"Fess Up\".Professor Longhair died in his sleep of a heart attack while the filming of the documentary was under way (and before the live concert, which was planned to be its climax). Footage from his funeral was included in the documentary.

Most critics and fans were disappointed on its release\u2014especially with its sound and production values, and the omission of stand-out live tracks \"In the Pouring Rain\" and \"Ammunition\", usually titled \"Jericho\" in contemporary bootleg recordings.Cut the Crap sold poorly compared to earlier Clash releases, reaching just number 16 in the UK charts and number 88 in the US. On release, British and American critics alike generally viewed the album in an unfavourable light. Melody Maker and NME both published sharply negative reviews, the latter of which was titled \"No Way, Jose\" in sarcastic reference to the \"Jose Unidos\" production credit. Reflecting the critical consensus at the time, Mike Laye\u2014a writer, photographer and Clash insider\u2014said the band should \"just drop the 'Cut' from the title, because to me this [is] crap.\" Robert Christgau, a longtime champion of the Clash in the US, offered only restrained praise in a Village Voice review that alluded to the negative word-of-mouth and summarised most of the album as \"stubborn and jolly and elegiac and together\". Music journalist Richard Cromelin found the album's uptempo songs less effective than those on earlier Clash records, but concluded that Strummer's singing is compelling and \"This Is England\" and \"North and South\" make the record \"more than passable\".The absence of Jones and Headon led many to regard it as a Joe Strummer solo album\u2014an impression further solidified by Simonon's involvement being limited only to the pre-production stage. Its shortcomings were often attributed to Strummer's evident disillusionment with the group and the fact that he was grieving over the recent deaths of his parents. Joe Sasfy of The Washington Post wrote that the \"revised version of the Clash sounds like a pale and ghostly facsimile of this once-great band\"; he disliked the \"[tiresome] garbled choruses\" and he found that \"Strummer's attempt to enliven them with horn charts creates an ungainly mess of a sound.\" Similarly, Richard Defendorf of the Orlando Sentinel described the record as a \"sometimes embarrassingly anachronistic ... attempt to rekindle the Clash's punkish, militant energy.\" Music critic Liam Lacey was more favourable and concluded that, given the strength of \"This Is England\", \"in its cheesily self-aggrandizing way, the new Clash may be on to something.\"Cut the Crap has been favourably reevaluated in some retrospective reviews, many praising Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance. The writer Jon Savage praised the album in his influential 1991 book on the history of punk, England's Dreaming, highlighting the \"innovative use of rap rhythm and atmosphere\". Yet its reputation as a failure, or at least as a lost opportunity, has endured. In 2002, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described \"This Is England\" as \"surprisingly nervy\" on a record that, in his view, is otherwise \"formulaic, tired punk rock that doesn't have the aggression or purpose of early Clash records\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The group was originally called the U-Men and played most of their gigs in the Rockaways (Peyton Place & McNultys) and Long Island (The Attic, Tiger's Tail etc.)\nIn 1966, Stapleton's brother, John, arranged for the group to play at a club in Queens, New York (The John Doe Room) where a record company executive heard them and eventually signed the band, but suggested a name change was in order. The band continued to play top 40 covers while working on their own original music.\nBy the fall of 1966 the composition of the band had changed with Peppi's brother Micky on guitar, Denny Ryan on drums, Teddy H. on rhythm & singing, and Art Fahie (aka/ Crazy Artie) on bass. The introduction of the \"Rats\" to Long Island's northshore took place at a club called the \"Knotty Knee\", whose owners Jack Dowd & Al Cunningham trusted the group to fill the venue seven-nights per week. A few years later, Marty Ross took ownership of the place under the name \"McDimples\", and for a while everything went on as it had been.  The \"Rats\" were also known for playing \"The Cage\" in Williston Park, as well as \"The Go-Go 7\" in Port Washington. In 1968, \"Teddy\" Haenlein was drafted and went to Vietnam, but did rejoin the group from 1970 to 1972.\nIn 1969, the band released their first album, the self-titled The Good Rats which had cult popularity with New Yorkers local and transplanted when it launched.  Two of its more memorable cuts are the intro song: \"We Are The Good Rats\" where the band members sing the \"hello-hello-hello\" greeting used by the 3 Stooges; and the landmark \"Joey Ferrari\", a proto-punk song (\"Joey Ferrari, though you're from the poor side, don't give you no right to go wild\"). The Good Rats continued to build a following, playing Long Island's thriving club scene, along with other groups, such as Twisted Sister and Zebra. From 1970 until early 1972, the band consisted of Peppi, Mickey, Teddy (guitar) John Argento (bass) and Charlie Zarou (drums). They played weekly at The Baldwin Manor, Back Alley Sallys (of which Peppi and John Argento took on a partnership of the bar). The Rats doing cover tunes, adding originals in, till originals were primarily asked for, during this time songs such as \"Hour Glass\", \"Injun Joe\", \"Mean Mother\", \"Yellow Flower\", were requested by a fan base that continued to grow rapidly. A rare studio recorded LP, recorded and mastered at Echo Studios, East Meadow, was used for shopping the band to record companies.\nIn 1974, the Good Rats released their best-known and most popular album, Tasty. It featured a blend of hard rock and blues, highlighted by Marchello's raspy vocals.  Various songs from this record, including \"Injun Joe\", \"Papa Poppa\", \"Back to My Music\" and \"The Songwriter\", and the blues title track, received airplay around the country on FM radio. During the following years, the Rats performed at venues such as Madison Square Garden, The Philadelphia Spectrum, The Nassau Coliseum, The Hammersmith Odeon in England, and New York's Central Park, as well as showcase rooms such as The Bottom Line (Manhattan), My Father's Place (Roslyn, New York), Whiskey a Go Go (Los Angeles), Casino Arena (Asbury Park, NJ) and The Paradise Room (Boston). They headlined or opened for bands such as Rush, Journey, Kiss, Meat Loaf, Aerosmith, Ozzy Osbourne, The Grateful Dead, Bruce Springsteen, The Allman Brothers Band, Mountain and Styx.Between 1976 and 1980, The Good Rats released a series of albums, including Ratcity in Blue, From Rats to Riches (1978), Birth Comes to Us All, and Live At Last, all of which were well received by the band's fan base, and received some airplay on FM radio.  In 1981, Gatto and Kotke left the band, and were replaced by future Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick and bass player Schuyler Deale (who later played with Billy Joel and Michael Bolton), for the album Great American Music. The band did shows until 1983 and then broke up.\nThroughout the 1980s, Peppi Marchello continued to write and produce recordings with his son Gene. They toured locally for a while under the name \"Popzarocca\" until the song \"First Love\" became a minor hit for Gene's band, Marchello.  Marchello also recorded a music video for \"First Love\", and had received minor airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball. This band featured Gene on guitar and lead vocals, drummer John Miceli (Meat Loaf, Rainbow, and bassist Nick DiMichino (NineDays [Something To Listen To, Monday Songs, Three, The Madding Crowd, So Happily Unsatisfied, Flying the Corporate Jet]), (Matt White [Best Days]). The band recorded two albums (only one which was released).\nIn the mid-1990s, Marchello and sons Gene Marchello and Stefan Marchello began playing out locally under \u201cThe Good Rats\u201d name. They released three new studio CDs with this lineup, Tasty Seconds (1996), Let's Have Another Beer (2000), and Play Dum (2002).  Marchello also released a live recording of a 1979 appearance on a Rochester radio show, Rats, The Way You Like \u2019Em.\nIn 1998, Marchello wrote \"A Tale of Two Balls,\" the introduction to the book Conflicts of Disinterest (Aardwolf Publishing) by Clifford Meth.In the 2000s, the band continued to play in local venues throughout New York, Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as playing annually in their own summer weekend outdoor festival aptly named \"Ratstock\".  At one point, the \"new\" Good Rats (Peppi and his sons) performed as the opening act for a reunion performance by the \"old\" Good Rats. Billed as \"The Original Good Rats\" Peppi was joined by Mickey, Kotke, Franco, and Gatto on October 4, 2008, in a small venue on Long Island, and for a pair of sold-out shows at B.B. King's in Manhattan.\nIn 2008, Gene Marchello left the band to go out on his own.  Nevertheless, The Good Rats, featuring Peppi and Stefan Marchello continued playing weekend club dates around Long Island.\nThe Good Rats were inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2008.\nPeppi Marchello is quoted prominently in the IDW Publishing graphic novel Snaked by Clifford Meth and has been the subject of other stories by the author.In July, 2009, Peppi Marchello cut a series of three commercials for the car donation organization Kars4Kids.In Magnolia Pictures 2011 release Roadie, the character Nikki pulls out Ratcity in Blue from Jimmy's vinyl record collection and they listen to a couple of tracks starting with \"Advertisement in the Voice\". This brings back memories of them seeing the band every Saturday night with their friend Steph when they were in high school. Peppi Marchello makes a cameo appearance in the film.\nIn 2012, Peppi Marchello released a new Good Rats album, Blue Collar Rats: The Lost Archives on his Uncle Rat Music label.  The CD contained one new song plus 19 previously unreleased songs recorded between 1975 and 1984, some featuring the original Good Rats line-up, and others including Kulick, Deale, Gene Marchello and various other musicians.\nThe Original Good Rats continued to play two spring shows (in one night) annually at Manhattan's B.B. King's, as well as a show in the fall at \"The Crazy Donkey\" in Long Island, until 2013.\nPeppi Marchello died on July 10, 2013, of a heart attack at his Nissequogue home. He was 68 and was recovering from heart surgery he had in June.Aardwolf Publishing announced the publication of Peppi Marchello: Song Writer on Kickstarter.In 2014, Stefan Marchello released a posthumous album of material that he and Peppi had worked on before Peppi's death, titled Afterlife. In 2016, he released Making Rock and Roll Great Again, an album that contains more of Peppi Marchello's posthumous material, plus some original material by Stefan Marchello.\nThe band now continues with Stefan Marchello.

The band, with vocalist Adam Agee at the forefront, has matured and altered their formula from blink-182-type power punk to meaningful vertical praise. Like their hard rock counterparts Kutless, the Arizona foursome seem to have found their true selves in praise & worship music, focusing their fierce rock energy like a laser beam to connect with listeners in new and amazing ways.\"Jay of New Release Tuesday went on to say: \"Stellar Kart\u2019s fourth studio project Everything is Different Now is in no way a let down. In fact, I believe this to be the best project from Stellar Kart yet, as the band proves to be improving more with each and every project. I can recommend this album to any Christian music fan in general, because it contains everything from worship, to rock, and even includes Stellar Kart\u2019s very own punk sound. This is an awesome album!\"The Christian Manifesto wrote, regarding the album: \"Stellar Kart has done a lot of work, but as always, there is still more to do. It would be great for them to tackle slower, unhurried songs and I would love to see them continue to write more of their own work. Nevertheless there is plenty for the fans to love and for newcomers to enjoy. All in all, I believe that Everything is Different Now sets the standard and is the foundation from which Stellar Kart will continue to work on. As a massive improvement on their past efforts, it goes to show how bands can develop and get better with time. This LP reminds us how far a little bit of change can go in the journey of development \u2026 I\u2019m hoping that their next release will revolutionize everything again, and let us join them on their adventure.\"On the other side, Brandon J. of Indie Vision Music stated plainly: \"This band does have talent deep within. What Stellar Kart needs to do to break the chains of repetition is to drop their producer, not because he isn't cutting it but because it\u2019s time for a change of scenery. They need to take back all the writing credits for their songs and not rely on others to do the work for them. They need to stop doing tours of teen girl conventions, and youth night at the local Church. If they really want to expand their horizons, it\u2019s time to test the waters and go out on their own. Maybe tour with other General market bands, or like minded Christian artists who have  a similar style. I\u2019m not 16 anymore and I seriously doubt any of these guys are near that age so it\u2019s time to grow up a bit. I know that sounds harsh but the writing style on this album is aimed at Christian teens and it\u2019s like it was purposely written that way. I can\u2019t be the only guy feeling this way? Maybe I'm just burnt out on the Contemporary Christian Market because I've been a part of it in some small way for so many years.\"  Nathaniel Schexnayder of Jesus Freak Hideout concurred by saying: \"I've always thought that Stellar Kart has needed to make changes, both musically and lyrically, to make themselves a more stand-out band. However, while changes have been implemented with their latest release, I can't help but wonder if the album has set them back. Undoubtedly, Stellar Kart fans will fall in love with Everything Is Different Now, but, as a whole, I couldn't wait to stop listening to Stellar Kart\u2019s overproduced, underwhelming album. Maybe I'm just cynical. Or maybe this is just Stellar Kart\u2019s fourth half-hearted album in five years which fails to show both musical and lyrical maturity.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Frederick II was responsible for the construction of many castles in Apulia, but Castel del Monte's geometric design was unique. The fortress is an octagonal prism with an octagonal tower at each corner. The towers were originally some 5 m (16 ft) higher than now, and they should perhaps include a third floor.Both floors have eight rooms, and an eight-sided courtyard occupies the castle's centre. Each of the main rooms has vaulted ceilings. Three of the corner towers contain staircases. The castle has two entrances, an unobtrusive service entrance and an ornate main entrance. Frederick II's main entrance featured elements from classical architecture such a pediment supported by rather thin fluted pilasters, and may have been influenced by Frederick II's interest in Greco-Roman architecture.\nThe octagonal plan is unusual in castle design. Historians have debated the purpose of the building and it has been suggested that it was intended as a hunting lodge. Another theory is that the octagon is an intermediate symbol between a square (representing the earth) and a circle (representing the sky). Frederick II may have been inspired to build to this shape by either the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which he had seen during the Sixth Crusade, or by the Palatine Chapel of Aachen Cathedral.\nOccasionally used as a hunting lodge under Manfred of Sicily, the castle become a state prison under the latter's victor, Charles I of Anjou: here Manfred's sons Henry, Azzo and Enzo were kept as prisoner after 1266, as well as other Hohenstaufen supporters.The main wall is 25 m (82 ft) high and the eight bastions each 26 m (85 ft).

Lisa Dombrowski, the author of The Films of Samuel Fuller: If You Die, I'll Kill You! and an associate professor of film studies at Wesleyan University, referred to the film as \"an impassioned attack on racial hatred.\" Another New York Times reviewer, Janet Maslin, praised Fuller's \"command of stark, spooky imagery,\" \"B-style bluntness,\" and the way the cinematography, scene setting, and soundtrack combine to give the film \"the blunt, unnerving power of a horror story.\" She also commended Paul Winfield's performance as Keys, feeling the actor turned what might have been a boring character into one audiences would find interesting. Slant Magazine's Fernando F.

If it helps people in whatever circumstances they're in, that's amazing, but I definitely don't classify us as a Christian band.\" Elsewhere, Christian has remarked, \"[My faith] affects every single aspect of my life, but I'm not a preacher, I'm an entertainer.\"Despite these statements and others of the like, multiple sources list the band as part of the Christian rock genre, and some Anberlin song lyrics do contain Christian references. Furthermore, the band appears at Christian music festivals such as Parachute Music Festival and Cornerstone Festival, and their songs have been included on Christian rock compilation CDs and DVDs.  They are also played on the Gospel Music Channel.Anberlin has also been repeatedly featured in Christian rock magazine HM (Hard Music, which was originally the fanzine Heaven's Metal). Christian submitted a letter to the magazine, criticizing the more overtly religious Christian punk band the Knights of the New Crusade for a promotional image that represented a \"black mark on the face of Christianity\".Christian has also said in an interview with Lightforce radio how the band tries to \"step out of the bubble\" and referred to themselves as being part of Christian music. He discussed in detail what Christians should do in their lives: love and embrace others as Jesus would as well as show God's grace to others. He mentioned as well how the band Fall Out Boy said in an interview that they did not really know much about Jesus until Anberlin toured with them.In an interview with Smartpunk, drummer Nathan Young commented, \"The thing is, some bands that are trying to get out of the Christian market, they get bummed out by questions about it. I don\u2019t really mind it, because I\u2019m a Christian, and I\u2019m okay talking about it. With the whole term 'Christian Band,' I don\u2019t understand how a band can be Christian. We get the question, 'Is Anberlin a Christian band?' and it\u2019s like, yeah, Anberlin is \u2014 as humans\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

She moved to Nashville one week before her 21st birthday, where she now resides, and worked as a background singer for a number of artists, including Bill Gaither and Amy Grant.Plumb was originally formed in 1997 as a five-piece band that consisted of Arbuckle on vocals, Joe Porter on drums, Matt Stanfield on keyboards, J.J. Plasencio on bass guitar and Stephen Leiweke on guitar, with name, Plumb, coming from the Suzanne Vega song \"My Favorite Plum\". Following Silvertone Records affiliate Essential Records mainstream alternative radio success with its debut artist Jars of Clay in 1995, the label signed Plumb as its second artist. When Arbuckle was urged to write, she turned to Matt Bronleewe\u2014an original member of Jars of Clay who happened to be her next-door neighbor\u2014and the two hit it off. The debut album, Plumb, was released in 1997. Plumb has said subsequently that the addition of the letter \"B\" to the end was the idea of her producer Matt Bronleewe and, in her mind, also represents Bronleewe's important contribution to her sound.In 1999, Plumb released a second studio album, Candycoatedwaterdrops, which won the 2000 Gospel Music Association Dove Award for \"Modern Rock Album of the Year\". Three tracks from it were later covered by other artists; \"Stranded\" and \"Here with Me\" by Jennifer Paige and, in 2001, \"Damaged\" by Plummet. Though the album won the DOVE Award for Best Modern Rock Album in 2000, and saw strong radio success with the single \"God-Shaped Hole\", the subject matter and approach of much of Plumb's music was often considered too dark and taboo for the mainstream Christian marketplace. Plumb's tendency to write songs about deeply personal issues, such as international hit \"Cut\" which addressed cutting, and \"Damaged\" which addressed a girl coping with being molested as a child, led to more enthusiastic reception by fans of alternative and dance music. Fueling the break from contemporary Christian music, \"Cut\" was also used prominently during a pivotal scene in the storyline of The Vampire Diaries in the 10th episode of season 1, \"The Turning Point\". Later in 1999, all band members left the band, and since that time Plumb became a solo project of Tiffany Arbuckle.\nPlumb considered leaving the music industry after the 2000 album, but changed her mind after receiving a note from a fan a few hours before what she thought to be her final concert. The letter was about her song \"Damaged\" about a girl coping with being molested as a child. The note said \"Whatever you do, I just want you to never forget that you have changed someone's life,\" which inspired Plumb to remain in the music industry. She signed to Curb Records in 2003, releasing the album Beautiful Lumps of Coal on March 25, 2003. The lead single, \"Real\", peaked at No. 41 on the UK Singles Chart. Her next album, Chaotic Resolve, entered the Billboard 200 album chart at No. 177 on March 9, 2006. \"Better\" reached No. 1 on the U.S. Christian airplay chart. The Bronleewe & Bose remix of her follow-up \"Cut\", hit No. 1 on SiriusXM's dance hits channel BPM, and No. 5 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart.Shortly after the birth of her second child, Plumb recorded her fifth album, Blink, as a collection of lullaby inspired songs. It was released on October 9, 2007, immediately becoming one of her best selling and most enduring albums to date. Lead single \"In My Arms\" was used in conjunction with key plot narratives for both Vampire Diaries and One Tree Hill, and became Plumb's biggest international hit to date, selling close to half a million singles in both the United States and Russia. \"In My Arms\" received remixes by Kaskade, Scotty K, Bronleewe & Bose, Gomi, and Bimbo Jones, with the latter reaching the No. 3 spot on the Billboard Dance chart.On May 19, 2009, Curb Records announced that it would release a career-spanning greatest hits album, Beautiful History, which was released later in the year and included several new songs. The first single from Beautiful History, \"Hang On\", reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2009 and reached the top spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in 2010.\nPlumb returned to the studio in 2010 with longtime producer and co-writer Matt Bronleewe to begin work on what would become her 6th studio album, while also changing management and signing with alternative boutique firm Street Talk Media. The debut single from the project, \"Drifting\", a co-penned duet with longtime friend Dan Haseltine (of Jars of Clay), spread quickly across Christian rock radio. The second single, \"Need You Now (How Many Times)\", went to contemporary Christian music radio in early 2012 and has become Plumb's most successful single to date in that market, rising to number to No. 1 on multiple radio and iTunes charts in both the United States and Canada by year's end. The single has remained in regular rotation nationwide for well over a year, selling close to 300,000 singles on iTunes to date, and is BDS certified at over 100,000 radio spins. The album Need You Now was released worldwide in February 2013, charting at a career-best No. 56 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 2 on Christian album charts. The album received five Dove Award nominations including Song of the Year and Contemporary/Pop Album of the Year. With her children now all at least grade school age, and with the massive success of Need You Now, 2012 and 2013 saw the most aggressive touring of her entire career, playing major festivals throughout 2012 and 2013, embarking on her first and largely sold-out headlining tour in the fall of 2013, and joining the massive Winterjam arena tour for November 2013-14.Plumb released her seventh studio album, Exhale, on May 4, 2015.Plumb left Curb Records in early 2017 to form her own label, Plumb Music, and released her first single \"God Help Me\" in July 2017. The song was one of six tracks included on the EP God Help Me in late 2017. She followed it up with the album Beautifully Broken in June 2018 on Centricity Music.Following the No. 1 chart successes of \"In My Arms\", \"Hang On\", and \"Cut\", Plumb has been increasingly sought-after in the dance and electronic world. In 2011, she collaborated with trance DJ Paul Van Dyk on \"I Don't Deserve You\", playing several shows with Van Dyk, and filming a music video together in middle Tennessee.

{"id": "264_447", "question": "What music label is The Deep represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_53913", "text": "The Deep was an American psychedelic rock band made up of musicians from New York City, who in 1966 traveled to Philadelphia to record a one-time LP, Psychedelic Moods.  The band was experimentally progressive, as they were one of the earliest groups to record psychedelic music, before it was adapted by a wider array of musical acts.  Although their only album failed to achieve success, it later gained acclaim for being considered the earliest work to reference \"psychedelic\" in its title.Information on the band is sparse as only one band member had a confirmed musical career prior to recording. The member, Rusty Evans (born Marcus Uzilevsky, 1937, New York City, died December 5, 2015, Woodacre, California), was the Deep's lead guitarist, primary songwriter, and a vocalist.  Evans initially recorded in 1958 as a rockabilly singer, before performing as a Greenwich Village folk musician in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  He recorded three albums as Rusty Evans \u2013 Songs of Our Land, Railroad Songs (both 1964) and Live at Gerde's Folk City (1965) \u2013 and was later a member of the folk group The New Christy Minstrels. Musician David Bromberg is also known to have played on The Deep's one and only album, although it is unknown on which tracks he played.In the early summer of 1966, Evans convinced producer Mark Barkan to help him record a psychedelic album.  They secured arrangements with the Philadelphia-based Cameo-Parkway label, the home for fellow protopunk act Question Mark and the Mysterians, for a meager budget of $1200.  In August, Evans and Barkan assembled a group of New York musicians to record as the Deep, and they drove in a rundown car to Philadelphia to record what would become the Psychedelic Moods album, which was done in the short period of four days and would necessitate late-night sessions in order to be finished on time.  The all-night sessions also provided the musicians, who were unable to afford a hotel, with a place to sleep.While the exact release date of the album has yet to be definitively established, the record is generally considered to have been distributed in October 1966, based on the album's catalogue number. This would credit it as the first official album to include the word \"psychedelic\" in its title, pre-dating the Blues Magoos' debut, Psychedelic Lollipop, and The 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. The Deep's Psychedelic Moods did not sell well, and the group did not tour to support it. They existed as a studio-only band, and, aside from sessions for their album, produced no other recordings under that name.Evans left Cameo-Parkway to record a new album for the Columbia Records label in 1967. Abandoning the \"Deep\" name, this second album was credited to the band The Freak Scene and entitled Psychedelic Psoul. Despite the name change, the band still contained the original lineup from the first album, and the sound of this album is very similar to that of Psychedelic Moods. It is typically considered a follow-up in all but name. As its title suggests, Psychedelic Psoul is composed of psychedelic-influenced tracks as the band continued to develop past concepts from their debut album. However, The Freak Scene's album met the same results as Psychedelic Moods. They did not tour, and their album did not chart. The album has been rereleased by Sony BMG through Columbia Records on vinyl. The group disbanded in late 1967.After this venture, Evans returned to performing as a solo musician. He recorded under his birthname, Marcus, for a self-titled album in 1969, which produced compositions conceived as psychedelic folk in nature. He did not record another album until 1979, when he released Life's Railway Heaven, another folk effort. Evans recorded sporadically until his death, usually in the style of folk or rockabilly music,  and in the 1990s released two new age CDs, Slice of Light and Gypsy Dreams, credited as Uzca.  He also led a Johnny Cash tribute band.  Under his real name of Marcus Uzilevsky, he was a respected visual artist best known for his landscape paintings, and was exhibited widely in California.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

This connection quickly fascinated American and International Media, which led to much being written about this unique example of life-imitating-art, and many international tours with the author. Many fans of this phenomenon felt that this was a necessary complicating counter-narrative to a simplistic and largely Islamophobic post-9/11 American media landscape.\nThey came to renown in South Asia from songs they released in Punjabi, Urdu, and Hindi. Their filmed BBC session where the band covered Bollywood classic \"Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai\" especially got the band much positive attention from the Southern Asian and Punjabi peoples, both native and abroad.\nOne of their biggest hits is the song \"Tunnnnnn\", which is a re-interpretation of a classic reggae song; Willie Williams' \"Armagideon Time\". The lyrics of \"Tunnnnnn\" are a mashup of English, Urdu, and Punjabi. Its lyrics proclaim (in Urdu): \"We will only drink what they drink in Iraq! We will only drink what they drink in Karbala!\", touching upon the subject of the horrific reality of warfare and the bombs which were dropped on those places. \"Tunnnnnn\" was an instant hit with both Kominas fans and newcomers alike.\nWith the self-titled release \"Kominas\" in 2012, the band has adopted the more Americana rock elements grunge and garage rock in their style and moved away from writing about Muslim-centric issues.  From 2009\u20132012 the band toured extensively around America, Canada, and Europe. However, since 2012, the band's output has only been mostly daily missives on their Facebook page, which is more often than not, a commentary on the daily politics of race and religion.\nThe 2021 television series \"We Are Lady Parts\", written and directed by Nida Manzoor, used the song title \"Ain\u2019t No One Gonna Honour Kill My Sister But Me,\" pulled without permission from or attribution to The Kominas's track \"No One Gonna Honor Kill My Baby (but me)\" from their eponymous 2011 album.Though their commentary has remained political, many fans feel their music has grown less ethnocentric or religious-minded and has taken become more absurdist and nihilistic.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "264_453", "question": "What music label is Butterfly Train represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_41901", "text": "In the years since its release, Butterfly has been hailed as being an R&B classic. In a retrospective review for The Washington Post, Bethonie Butler focused on the album's impact, stating that it \"changed the face of pop music\" by paving \"the way for other pop stars...to sing alongside their rap contemporaries\". Writing for Jezebel, Rich Juzwiak focused on the influence of Carey's vocal stylings in the track \"Breakdown\", remarking that \"in this day and age, when there\u2019s so much genre blending that it\u2019s sometimes impossible to label an artist as merely \u201csinger\u201d or \u201crapper,\u201d it'd be foolish to understate the prescience of\" the song. A profile of the album in Essence by Jessica Littles further stated that the album \"catalyzed the pop music trend of collaborating with hip-hop artists\", concluding that it \"not only showcased her [Carey's] already-established prowess as a vocalist, who could belt out ballads or flirt over the hottest summer jams, but also as one of the most versatile songwriters in contemporary music\".The lead single from the album, \"Honey\", was notable for pushing Carey further towards hip hop and R&B than before. The music video gained further attention, as Carey, for the first time in her career, was provocatively dressed, giving viewers a \"taste of the freer Mariah.\" The Puerto Rico-filmed video's concept was created by Carey with Paul Hunter filling in as the director. Featuring a James Bond theme, Carey was a \"very sexy agent M\", in the words of Nickson, who escapes a large mansion in which she has been held captive. Carey said of the video: \"I don't really think the video is overtly sexual, but for me\u2014I mean people used to think I was the nineties version of Mary Poppins!\"\nAt the time of the video's release, Carey and Mottola were in the midst of their divorce. Tabloids and critics were linking the video's theme to Carey's marriage, writing how Mottola would lock her in their mansion, although she denied this. In an interview, Carey said that \"Tommy loves the video, he says it's my best video yet.\" Carey's writing partner of six years, Afanasieff, felt the video was undeniably about Mottola.The music video for \"The Roof\" was ranked 18th on Slant's \"100 Greatest Music Videos\". Sal Ciquemani, from Slant, gave the video a positive review, complimenting Carey's pairing the sultry song with a \"sophisticated tale of a sexy rooftop encounter.\" The video shows Carey reminiscing on a past love and a night they shared together on a rainy roof-top. The video revolves around the settings of a dark limousine, a decrepit NYC apartment, and a rainy roof-top, where according to Slant, \"Carey is featured at her most vulnerable, with runny mascara and drenched in the cold rainy night.\" In the conclusion of his review of the video, Ciquemani wrote: \"When Carey rises through the limo's sunroof and relishes the warm November rain, she's not drunk on the bubbly but on the memory of past delights.\" The video for \"My All\" was also one of the more notable videos from Butterfly. The video featured Carey in various places, including a submerged vessel, a lighthouse and a large conch shell floating the shore. In each of the scenes, Carey is shown lamenting her love and yearning to be re-united with him once more. In the video's climax, Carey meets her love in the lighthouse, where they caress and drift into the \"nights abyss.\" According to author Chris Nickson, the scenes of Carey on the overturned vessel showed her vulnerability without her loved one, truly emphasizing the yearning featured in the song.Butterfly, recognised by critics as one of Carey's best albums at that point in her career, received several awards and was nominated for others. At the Billboard Music Awards, Carey received an honorary award, recognizing her achievement of earning \"The Most Number-one Singles Ever by a Female Solo Artist in History\". \"Honey\" was nominated at the 1998 Grammy Awards for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song, while \"Butterfly\" was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Butterfly won a Japan Gold Disc Award in the \"International Pop Album of the Year\" category. For Butterfly, Carey won the American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist in 1998. Additionally, the album won the BMI Pop Award for Songwriter of the Year and the Songwriter awards for \"Honey\", \"Butterfly\" and \"My All\". At the Soul Train Music Awards in 1998, Carey won the awards for the Aretha Franklin Entertainer of the Year and Soul Train Lady of Soul, which were presented to her by Chris Tucker and Patti LaBelle.Butterfly was nominated at the 1998 NAACP Image Awards, in the Outstanding Female Artist category. At the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, Carey was named the Songwriter of the Year and received the Song of the Year award. At the 1998 World Music Awards, Carey won two of night's top awards; the World's Best-selling R&B Artist and the World's Best-selling Recording Artist of the '90s. Carey was unhappy not to win any of the Grammy Awards once again, but this was offset by the success of her tour, which was taking place during the awards. According to author Marc Shapiro, \"No amount of awards could replace the popular acceptance of Butterfly and the feeling she was now free to live her own life \u2013 creatively and personally.\" In a recent list compiled by a selection of rock critics, Butterfly was chosen as one of the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.The album was released with two different covers and in 2007 one of them was listed on Maxim's Sexiest Album Covers.", "hasanswer": false}]}

I suppose I had a secret desire to sing.\" They soon teamed up with bass guitarist Alex Keyser and drummer Andy Henderson, who had previously played with PJ Harvey's band. Guitarist Debbie Smith, formerly of Curve, came on board in 1994. According to the Epic Records' website, the group came up with the name Echobelly from the notion of \"being hungry for something\". With Madan and Johansson as the band's songwriters, they recorded their debut EP, Bellyache, on the independent Pandemonium label in late 1993.The favourable response to Bellyache helped Echobelly secure a recording contract with Rhythm King, which was then part of Epic. Once on board the label, the group released the \"I Can't Imagine the World Without Me\" single in June 1994. The group then recorded the album Everyone's Got One, which included the single \"Insomniac\" and reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart. The single was featured in the film and soundtrack of Dumb and Dumber.\nAs their music received more airplay, Echobelly won admiration from other artists as well. Madonna expressed interest in putting them on her Maverick label (existing contractual arrangements prevented that), and R.E.M. requested the group as the opening act for their upcoming tour. The band returned to the studio in 1995 to create their next album, On, produced by Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie, who had also produced Hole and Radiohead.\nMadan's lyrics often ventured into the less explored side of life, addressed in songs such as \"King of the Kerb\". and \"Dark Therapy\". \"I wanted to challenge myself as a lyricist on a different level on this album,\" Madan said in Rolling Stone. \"I want people to tell me what they thought the lyrics are about. I'm not a politician. I'm not interested in changing everybody around me. I'm interested in myself.\"\nWhile many of the songs lamented the state of things, others on the On album celebrated the endless possibilities of the human spirit. In \"Great Things\", Madan sang \"I want to do great things / I don't want to compromise / I want to know what love is / I want to know everything.\" The album's mostly optimistic feel provides an intriguing contrast with its serious subject matter. As Pareles wrote, \"Both music and lyrics examine the tension between order and liberty\". Listeners in the UK responded favourably to the album, driving three singles from the release into the Top 30 of the UK Singles Chart. Sales of the album rose to over 150,000 in the UK, nearly double that of Everyone's Got One.\nHealth and legal problems interrupted the success of Echobelly in 1995 and 1996. Madan had a serious thyroid problem during her world tour that was potentially life-threatening, but was later cured. Bass guitarist James Harris joined after Keyser defected because of personal and artistic differences. The group also had disagreements with Rhythm King after the label moved to Arista. The band chose to stay with Epic. In 1996, Madan also ventured away from the group when she sang on a recording of the club band, Lithium. Smith left the band before the release of the band's third album Lustra, which was produced by Gil Norton and issued in November 1997. A single from the album, \"The World is Flat\", was released in August of that year.A four-year hiatus was brought to an end in 2001 when the band returned with the Digit EP and their fourth album, People Are Expensive (produced by Ben Hillier), which were released on their own Fry Up label.

This led to Stevens recording his first single as Mike Stevens Did I dream/I saw a field for Decca Records. It was arranged by John Paul Jones (later of Led Zeppelin) \u2013 for Decca Records but was not a success.In 1967 he suffered mental health problems and returned to his home village of Solva to recuperate. He started to write songs in Welsh and use themes from traditional Welsh music in a conscious effort to create a distinctive Welsh pop music. From 1967 to 1969 he recorded a series of now rare Welsh-language picture sleeve EPs (Mike Stevens, Rhif 2 (Number 2), Mwg (Smoke), Y Brawd Houdini ( The Brother Houdini), Meic Stevens, Diolch yn Fawr (Many Thanks), Byw yn y Wlad (Living in the Country)). These were made for local labels like Sain and Wren, for whom he was one of the first artistes to record. \nHe also performed around Britain during the '60s, as he continued to try to develop a reputation outside Wales. Stevens played on recording sessions (notably for his friend Gary Farr's debut album on the Marmalade label). He made a one-off English language LP, Outlander, for Warner Bros. Records in 1970, but the contract was abandoned by mutual consent. In 1972 Gwymon (Dryw) was released, an album containing some of his best songs such as Gwely Gwag (Empty bed), Merch o'r Fatri Wl\u00e2n and Taed Neb Yn \u00d4l.  In 1972 Gwymon (Wren records) was released, an album containing some of his best songs such as Gwely Gwag (Empty bed), Merch o'r Fatri Wl\u00e2n and Taed Neb Yn \u00d4l. These early LPs have become rare and sought after.\nStevens lived in Brittany between 1974 and 1977, performing in many festivals although he did not make any commercial recordings. He returned to Wales in 1977, and recorded G\u00f4g (Sain records, 1977). In 1978 self-published the disc Caneuon cynnar, of songs from earlier Wren recordings. He also wrote the music for the rock opera Dic Penderyn, based on events in the Merthyr Rising of 1831.  It was staged at the Cardiff National Eisteddfod and had earlier been recorded in Steven's 1972 album Gwymon and the compilation album Disgwyl Rhywbeth Gwell i Ddod.\nIn 1981, Stevens released a cassette of new songs, Cider Glider (The Farnham Sessions) in English, with the Cadillacs to accompany a return visit to Brittany. This was re-released on Voodoo Blues: 1979-92 by Blue Tit in 1994 with additional tracks.\nNos Du, Nos Da was released on Audio records in 1982 and included songs such as M\u00f4r O Cariad, Bobby Sands and Dic Penderyn. This was followed by Git\u00e2r Yn Y Twll Dan Star (Sain, 1983) that included songs from the lost rock opera Hirdaith A Craith Y Garreg Ddu. He used the Cadillacs once again to record Lapis Lazuli (Sain, 1985) which includes the song Erwan. The album Gwin A Mwg A Merched Drwg (Wine And Smoke And Bad Girls) was released in 1987 only on cassette. The band members included session musicians from London including Brian Godding. \nHe moved from Sain to the Flach label for Bywyd Ac Angau (Life and Death) in 1989. This was a bilingual album and more folkish in tone. Ware'n Noeth (Bi bop a lwla'r Delyn Aur) was recorded at Les Studio, Bethesda, and this was his first CD, released by Sain in 1991. This was followed by Er Cof Am Blant Y Cwm ar Crai (In Memory of the Children in the Crai valley), which includes a song of the same name. Stevens continued to make recordings for Sain records, available only on cassette. One was Yn Fwyw (Greater), recorded in the Swroco Tent at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1995. In 1998 he collaborated with lyricist Rob Mills to produce the album Mihangel on Crai records. \nYsbryd Solva (Spirit of Solva) (Sain records) was released during the National Eisteddfod at St Davids in 2002, and Meic a'r Gerddorfa (Meic and the Orchestra) was recorded at the Brangwyn Hall in Swansea and the  Ysgol Dyffryn Aman Hall in Ammanford with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and released by Sain records in 2005. In the later album Icarws (Sain, 2007), Stevens collaborated again with Geraint Jarman. Like Early Songs No. 1 and Ysbryd Solva, this was a collection of his old songs re-recorded.\nAn Evening With Meic Stevens was recorded in 2007 live at The Half Moon, Putney, London, for Sunbeam, and released with a DVD, the first official one from Stevens.  In 2008, his album Gwymon was reissued on the Sunbeam label with two live tracks in addition to the songs on the original album. Another album followed in 2010, Love Songs (Sain) in English. Most of these songs were written in the late 1950s. In August 2011, his latest controversial autobiography, 'Mas o 'Ma', was published.\nIn 2011, Stevens announced that he wanted to migrate to Canada to join an old girlfriend, Liz, whom he met during his time as an art student in Cardiff in the early 1960s. He played several farewell gigs in Wales before leaving for Canada. However, in 2019 he was living in Cardiff.Today Stevens' psych-folk influence can be heard in contemporary Welsh groups such as Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, and his song \"Cwm y Pren Helyg\" was recently covered by Alun Tan Lan. Several CDs of his are available from the Sain label in Caernarfon, and two volumes of his classic 1960s EPs have recently appeared on Sunbeam Records.Stevens can be found occasionally singing in certain pubs/hotels in Aberystwyth until the late hours. He can also be seen performing regularly throughout Wales and England at major festivals, eisteddfodau, pubs, theatres etc. He performs periodically in France, mainly Brittany where he is very popular.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In an interview with MTV News, Kahn said, \"I seem to be the guy that record companies go to when they need help,\" he joked. \"I truly feel [Brown] is remorseful. You don't drop people just because they made a mistake (even if it was a big mistake).\"Kahn said that the entire idea for the video was Brown's: \"It's an interesting video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically told me a story of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I fell in love with the idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper.\" When comparing the song's video to that of \"I Can Transform Ya\", the director said, \"'Crawl' is my favorite one, because \u2014 gosh, I'm going to let you in on this \u2014 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done.\" He went on to say, \"I mean, everything that's happened to him in the year, I think this is going to be his big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now.\" When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn said that the video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the \"genesis\" of what that idea was.On November 2, 2009, several stills from the video were released onto the internet. The photos focused on two sets of the video, a desert location, and a snow and puddle-spotted alleyway. In both settings, Brown wears the same thick black glasses, brown leather trench coat, white T-shirt, and fingerless gloves, among other attire. Cassie appears in a photo from the alleyway scenes, as the desert scenes show Brown in \"deep contemplation\". The video first aired on The Wendy Williams Show on Friday, November 13, 2009, when Brown was a guest on the show. The video opens with Brown sitting on an edge of a bed wearing a plain white T-shirt. As the music begins and he starts singing, his heart is shown lit up red and beating in his chest. The singer then walks into an alleyway on a winter's night, revealed in the air as he breathes. Brown walks past several storefronts, seeing images of Cassie broadcast on television. He then sees paparazzi taking photos of her, but she does not notice him. Brown is shown in a desert scene, and then returns to the winter night scene as Cassie sees him and they walk towards each other meeting face-to-face.

{"id": "264_479", "question": "What music label is Dwight Twilley represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_54028", "text": "Twilley and Phil Seymour met in Tulsa in 1967 at a theater where they had gone to see The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night, and soon began writing songs and recording together. They continued their partnership over the next several years under the band name Oister. Twilley wrote all the songs and played guitar and piano, Seymour played drums and bass, and both sang leads and harmonies. Later, guitarist Bill Pitcock IV played lead guitar on most of their tracks.\nTwilley and Seymour eventually decided to leave Tulsa and try to be discovered in Memphis, Tennessee. By sheer chance, the first recording studio that they wandered into was Sun Studio, where they met, according to Twilley, \"some guy named Phillips.\" After listening to a cassette of their folk/pop/country blend, Jerry Phillips (son of Sun founder Sam Phillips) referred them to the Tupelo, Mississippi studio of former Sun artist Ray Harris, whom both Twilley and Seymour credited for introducing them to rockabilly and adding a harder edge to their sound.Ultimately, Twilley and Seymour left Tulsa and went to Los Angeles in 1974 to find a label, where they signed with Shelter Records, a label with offices in Los Angeles and Tulsa that was co-owned by Denny Cordell and Tulsa's Leon Russell. Cordell promptly changed the group's name from Oister to the Dwight Twilley Band, which sowed the seeds for future problems arising from Seymour's anonymity in the partnership.  Because of Shelter's Tulsa headquarters, they were able to self-produce many songs in their hometown, recording at The Church Studio. They recorded \"I'm on Fire\" in one night at the historic studio. \nThat song became their debut single and reached #16 on the Billboard charts in 1975 with relatively little promotion, largely because the band was in England recording its first album, tentatively called Fire, with producer Robin Cable at Trident Studios. The photos used on the single's picture sleeve were low-quality from a photo booth, even less professional than the band's first promotional picture. The unexpected success of the self-produced \"I'm On Fire\" caused most of the English tracks recorded with Cable to be relegated to a second album, thereafter known as The B Album. Leon Russell then permitted the band to record new tracks at his 40-track home studio, where one of the engineers was Roger Linn, who also contributed lead guitars and bass to some of their recordings.\nDuring an appearance on American Bandstand, the band played what was to be its follow-up single, \"Shark (in the Dark)\", produced by Twilley, Seymour and Russell. The success of the film Jaws, however, caused Cordell and Shelter to reject the single, apparently to keep the group from being perceived as a cash-in novelty act. The eventual follow-up single, \"You Were So Warm\" backed with \"Sincerely\", failed due to distribution problems; just after the single was released, Shelter Records collapsed in the midst of a lawsuit between Russell and Cordell. The Dwight Twilley Band's completed album went unreleased for 10 months due to Shelter's switch from MCA Records to ABC Records for distribution, and The B Album was left unreleased.\nWhen the album Sincerely was finally released in 1976, it failed as well, peaking at #138. During this time, Seymour and Twilley befriended labelmate Tom Petty and Phil sang backing vocals on \"Breakdown\" and \"American Girl\", creating a long-lasting friendship.In 1977, the Dwight Twilley Band performed on the short-lived CBS Saturday morning kids show Wacko!.\nShelter then switched distribution again to Arista Records. ABC elected to keep Petty and J. J. Cale, leaving Twilley alone on the Shelter/Arista label. Pitcock became a credited member of the Dwight Twilley Band during touring and recording of the second album. However, that album, Twilley Don't Mind, proved to be another commercial disappointment in 1977. Seymour left the band the following year, pursuing a solo career with some success until he developed what proved to be terminal cancer. He died of lymphoma in 1993, and as of 2007 Twilley still did not perform Dwight Twilley Band songs that featured lead vocals by Seymour.The Dwight Twilley Band albums were reissued in CD form with bonus tracks by the audiophile DCC Compact Classics label in 1989 and 1990. In 1993, shortly before Phil Seymour's death, the Dwight Twilley Band released The Great Lost Twilley Album, which collected a fraction of the \"hundreds\" of early unreleased songs Twilley and Seymour had recorded for Shelter, including several songs from The B Album and Blueprint (a Twilley solo album discussed below), as well as a few alternate versions of released songs. However, once again the Dwight Twilley Band fell victim to some label politics, as EMI bought the rights to Shelter just weeks after the release, and all three of the DCC Dwight Twilley Band albums went out of print again.\nIn 1997, The Right Stuff, a reissue label owned by EMI, reissued Sincerely and Twilley Don't Mind with somewhat different bonus tracks from the DCC versions. They both went out of print the following year, when EMI discontinued the label.\nThe Dwight Twilley Band albums Sincerely and Twilley Don't Mind were reissued in a two-disk compilations by Australia's Raven Records in 2007 with still different bonus tracks.\nFinally, in 2009, a tape of the Dwight Twilley Band's October 1976 concert at the Agora Theatre and Ballroom in Cleveland, Ohio, which had been recorded for broadcast on Cleveland radio station WMMS, was remastered and released as a live album entitled Live From Agora.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 2005, Pitchfork wrote that it had \"challenged and confounded\" Radiohead's audience, and subsequently \"transformed into an intellectual symbol of sorts ... Owning it became 'getting it'; getting it became 'anointing it'.\" In 2015, Sheffield likened Radiohead's change in style to Bob Dylan's controversial move to rock music, writing that critics now hesitated to say they had disliked it at the time. He described Kid A as the \"defining moment in the Radiohead legend\". A year later, Billboard argued that Kid A was the first album since Bowie's Low to have moved \"rock and electronic music forward in such a mature fashion\". In an article for Kid A's 20th anniversary, the Quietus suggested that the negative reviews had been motivated by rockism, the tendency among music critics to venerate rock music over other genres.In a 2011 Guardian article about his critical Melody Maker review, Beaumont wrote that though his opinion had not changed, \"Kid A's status as a cultural cornerstone has proved me, if not wrong, then very much in the minority ... People whose opinions I trust claim it to be their favourite album ever.\" In 2014, Brice Ezell of PopMatters wrote that Kid A is \"more fun to think and write about than it is to actually listen to\" and a \"far less compelling representation of the band's talents than The Bends and OK Computer\". In 2016, Dorian Lynskey wrote in The Guardian: \"At times, Kid A is dull enough to make you fervently wish that they'd merged the highlights with the best bits of the similarly spotty Amnesiac ...

There was a period of indecision about what song would be released as the first single; the label wanted to get everything right for the campaign, because the all-girl group format was untested. The group, led by Brown and Halliwell, was adamant that the debut song should be \"Wannabe\", they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and the Girl Power statement. Virgin's executives believed that the first single should either be \"Say You'll Be There\", which they considered a much \"cooler\" track, or \"Love Thing\". At the beginning of 1996 the impasse between the group and their record label about the release of the single was temporarily solved. In March, Fuller announced that he agreed with Virgin in that \"Wannabe\" should not be the first single. The label wanted a song that appealed to the mainstream market, and nothing considered too radical. Halliwell was shocked and furious; she told Fuller, \"It's not negotiable as far as we're concerned. 'Wannabe' is our first single.\" Fuller and the executives at Virgin relented, and the song was chosen as their first single.The trigger for the Spice Girls' launch was the release of the \"Wannabe\" music video in May 1996. Its quick success on the British cable network The Box sparked press interest, despite initial resistance to the all-girl group idea. The same month, their first music press interviews appeared in Music Week, Top of the Pops, and Smash Hits, and their first live TV slot was broadcast on LWT's Surprise Surprise. A month after the video's release, the song was receiving intensive airplay on the main radio stations across the UK, while the group started to appear on television\u2014mainly on kid's programmes such as Live & Kicking\u2014and doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines. A full-page advertisement appeared in the July issue of Smash Hits, saying: \"Wanted: Anyone with a sense of fun, freedom and adventure. Hold tight, get ready! Girl Power is comin' at you\". The group appeared on the television programme This Morning with Richard and Judy, and performed at their first Radio One road show in Birmingham.\"Wannabe\" was first released in Japan on 26 June 1996 as a maxi CD. In the United Kingdom, the song was issued on 8 July 1996 in two single versions. The first one, released in two formats\u2014a standard CD single and a cassette single\u2014include the radio edit of the track, the Motiv 8 vocal slam remix, and the B-side, \"Bumper to Bumper\". The group wrote \"Bumper to Bumper\" with Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins\u2014the songwriter-production duo known as Absolute\u2014and British singer-songwriter Cathy Dennis. The second version, released on maxi single format on 15 July, feature the radio edit, an instrumental version, the Motiv 8 dub slam remix, and the Dave Way alternative mix. This version came with a fold-out postcard inlay and a stickered case.During the weeks following the UK release, the group began promotional visits abroad. They did three trips to Japan and brief visits to Germany and the Netherlands. On a trip to the Far East, they visited Hong Kong, Thailand, and South Korea. In January 1997 they travelled to North America to do a promotional campaign that Phil Quartararo, president of Virgin Records America, described as \"absolutely massive\". In Canada, the group did interviews for newspapers and radio stations, appeared in television programmes such as Hit List, and MusiquePlus, and attended an autograph signing at Montreal's HMV Megastore. During their visit to the US, the group met with influential radio programmers, TV networks, and magazines. In addition, the music video was placed into heavy rotation by MTV.", "hasanswer": false}]}

On the subject of joining the band in 1989, Steve Hogarth said in a 2001 interview: \"At about the same time, Matt Johnson of The The asked me to play piano on his tour. I always say I had to make a choice between the most hip band in the world, and the least.\" In the same conversation, he said: \"We're just tired of the opinions of people who haven't heard anything we've done in ten years. A lot of what's spread about this band is laughable.\"Much of the band's enduring and unfashionable reputation stems from their emergence in the early 1980s as the most commercially successful band of the neo-prog movement, an unexpected revival of the progressive rock musical style that had fallen out of critical favour in the mid-1970s. Some early critics were quick to dismiss the band as clones of Peter Gabriel-era Genesis due to musical similarities, such as their extended songs, a prominent and Mellotron-influenced keyboard sound, vivid and fantastical lyrics and the equally vivid and fantastical artwork by Mark Wilkinson used for the sleeves of their albums and singles.  Lead singer Fish was also often compared with Gabriel due to his early vocal style and theatrical stage performances, which in the early years included wearing face paint.\n\nAs Jon Wilde summarised in Melody Maker in 1989: At the end of a strange year for pop music, Marillion appeared in November 1982 with \"Market Square Heroes\". There were many strange things about 1982, but Marillion were the strangest of them all. For six years, they stood out of time. Marillion were the unhippest group going.  As punk was becoming a distant echo, they appeared with a sound and an attitude that gazed back longingly to the age of Seventies pomp.  When compared to Yes, Genesis and ELP, they would take it as a compliment. The Eighties have seen some odd phenomena. But none quite as odd as Marillion. Along the way, as if by glorious fluke, they turned out some singles that everybody quietly liked \u2013 \"Garden Party\", \"Punch and Judy\" and \"Incommunicado\". By this time, Marillion did not need the support of the hip-conscious. They were massive. Perhaps the oddest thing about Marillion was that they became one of the biggest groups of the decade. They might have been an anomaly but they were monstrously effective.\nThe band's unfashionable reputation and image has often been mentioned in the media, even in otherwise positive reviews. In Q in 1987, David Hepworth wrote: \"Marillion may represent the inelegant, unglamorous, public bar end of the current Rock Renaissance but they are no less part of it for that. Clutching at Straws suggests that they may be finally coming in from the cold.\" In the same magazine in 1995, Dave Henderson wrote: \"It's not yet possible to be sacked for showing an affinity for Marillion, but has there ever been a band with a larger stigma attached?\" He also argued that if the album Afraid of Sunlight \"had been made by a new, no baggage-of-the-past combo, it would be greeted with open arms, hailed as virtual genius.\" In Record Collector in 2002, Tim Jones argued they were \"one of the most unfairly berated bands in Britain\" and \"one of its best live rock acts.\" In 2004, Classic Rock's Jon Hotten wrote: \"That genre thing has been a bugbear of Marillion's, but it no longer seems relevant. What are Radiohead if not a progressive band?\" and said Marillion were \"making strong, singular music with the courage of their convictions, and we should treasure them more than we do.\" In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, an article on Marillion written by Mick Wall described them as \"probably the most misunderstood band in the world\".\nIn 2007, Stephen Dalton of The Times stated: The band have just released their 14th album, Somewhere Else, which is really rather good. Containing tracks that shimmer like Coldplay, ache like Radiohead and thunder like Muse, it is better than 80 per cent of this month's releases. But you are unlikely to hear Marillion on British radio, read about them in the music press or see them play a major festival. This is largely because Marillion have \u2013 how can we put this kindly? \u2013 an image problem. Their music is still perceived as bloated, bombastic mullet-haired prog-rock, even by people who have never heard it. In fairness, they did once release an album called Script for a Jester's Tear. But, come on, we all had bad hair days in the 1980s.\nDespite publishing a very good review for their 1995 album Afraid of Sunlight and including it in their 50 Best Albums of 1995, Q refused to interview the band or write a feature on them. Steve Hogarth later said: \"How can they say, this is an amazing record... no, we don't want to talk to you? It's hard to take when they say, here's a very average record... we'll put you on the front cover.\"In 2001, the television critic of The Guardian, Gareth McLean, used his review of the Michael Lewis BBC Two documentary, Next: The Future Just Happened, to concentrate on launching a scathing attack on the band, whose appearance only constituted one segment of the programme. He described them as \"once dodgy and now completely rubbish\" and he characterised their fans as \"slightly simple folks\". He also dismissed the band's efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: \"One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion.\"Rachel Cooke, a writer for The Observer and New Statesman, has repeatedly referred negatively to the band and insulted their fans in her articles.\nIn an interview in 2000, Hogarth expressed regret about the band retaining their name after he joined: If we had known when I joined Marillion what we know now, we'd have changed the name and been a new band. It was a mistake to keep the name, because what it represented in the mid-Eighties is a millstone we now carry. If we'd changed it, I think we would have been better off. We would have been judged for our music. It's such a grave injustice that the media constantly calls us a 'dinosaur prog band'. They only say that out of ignorance because they haven't listened to anything we've done for the last 15 bloody years. If you hear anything we've done in the last five or six years, that description is totally irrelevant... It's a massive frustration that no-one will play our stuff. If we send our single to Radio 1 they say: 'Sorry, we don't play music by bands who are over so-many years old... and here's the new U2 single.' I suppose it's something everyone has to cope with \u2013 every band are remembered for their big hit single, irrespective of how much they change over the years. But you can only transcend that by continuing to have hits. It's Catch 22. You know, at some stage, someone has to notice that we're doing interesting things. Someday someone will take a retrospective look at us and be surprised.\nThe 2013 film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa includes a joke reference to a former drummer of the band. The band were quoted: \"We know Marillion are seen as 'uncool' but we were delighted to be a part of it.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

I think it was something we just accidentally happened onto. By my being versatile. By my being able to sing different songs \u2013 being able to change my tone quality, having the different octaves. You must remember, I was capable of singing anything.\"\nBurke recalled: \"They weren\u2019t happy with my rendition, because I felt I had to talk.

The trains weren't running, but I made it in that morning and there was Solomon, who had come up from Philadelphia. We did four songs in three hours, including 'Just Out of Reach'. After we finished recording, I went into the control room to listen to the playback. I looked around for Solomon, but he was heading out the door. He said he had to get back to Philadelphia while it was still light because he had a job shoveling snow. I think he was getting paid $3.50 an hour. He already had something like eight kids.\" According to Tony Cummings, \"Despite the use of a different arranger at each session Solomon conquered all.

Rolling Stone described their music as \"idiosyncratic\" and \"inspired by the Afrocentric psychedelics\" of George Clinton and Sly Stone, and particularly by the psychedelic funk of Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic collective. The band's debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik incorporates analog elements such as Southern-styled guitar licks, languid soul melodies, and mellow 1970s funk grooves. It also features digital hip hop production elements such as programmed snare beats, booty bass elements, ATLiens and Aquemini feature outer space-influenced production with echo and reverb effects. With Stankonia, Outkast became the first hip-hop act to openly acknowledge rave culture as an influence. Stankonia and Speakerboxxx/The Love Below would draw on sources such as psychedelia, gospel, funk, techno, soul, electro, and rock music. During the late 1990s, rappers tended to embrace slow, laid-back beats in their productions.  On several tracks on Stankonia, the group employed faster, more chaotic tempos to reflect rave culture and the introduction of new drugs such as ecstasy into the hip-hop scene.One central motif of Outkast's songwriting is the duality of the two members and their differing personalities, with Big Boi as \"the player\" and Andr\u00e9 3000 as \"the poet\". Big Boi generally covers the more conventional hip-hop topics such as his childhood in the South, sex, and partying, while Andr\u00e9 3000 discusses more unorthodox themes. In contrast to much of hip hop music in the late 1990s, Outkast did not tone down its Southern regional qualities, like the harmonica break on \"Rosa Parks\" and distinctive Atlanta slang and diction throughout. The duo experimented with several delivery styles on the record, using \"relaxed, hyper, distorted, speedy and conversational presentations.\" Outkast often discusses the status of women in the South, and contrasts with the misogynistic attitudes common in hip-hop music.

Upon the premier of \"Love Lockdown\" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of Auto-Tune. The negative feedback intensified when West revealed that the entire album would be primarily sung with Auto-Tune rather than rapped and would focus on themes of love and heartache.Numerous hip hop fans and certain rappers mocked West for becoming \"sappy\" while others deemed the upcoming LP as a throwaway experimental album. Comparisons were drawn to Electric Circus, an album recorded by West's labelmate and close friend Common. MTV eventually interviewed Common to share his thoughts and views on the artistic direction of the album. Common expressed both his understanding and his support for West's intentions, stating \"I love it. I'mma tell you, as an artist, you wanna be free. I'mma do what I feel. You can't just cater to the audience. You gotta say, 'Hey, y'all, this is where I'm at.' For him to do an album called 808s and Heartbreak, you know that's where he is at this moment. I heard some songs, and I think it's fresh. I think the people are ready for it.\"West received similar approval from Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, both of whom contributed to the album. During an interview, when asked what music today inspires him, Wayne stated \"everybody's doing their thing, but they're not exciting. Everybody is doing the same thing. That's terrible. Do I love the music that's out right now? I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because 808s & Heartbreak isn't out yet.\" Despite the approval from the rap superstars, as well as the record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all that matters to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about being afraid and fitting in. Michael Jackson was an admirer of the album, with his daughter Paris saying he played it for her \"all the time.\" West went on to assert in October 2015 that despite many people rating My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy as his best album, 808s & Heartbreak is \"so much stronger\" in comparison.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Initially self-labeled as Bollywood Punk, the band adopted the label \"Taqwacore\", in reference to a book called The Taqwacores by American novelist Michael Muhammad Knight, which imagines what a would-be American Muslim Punk scene would look like. This connection quickly fascinated American and International Media, which led to much being written about this unique example of life-imitating-art, and many international tours with the author. Many fans of this phenomenon felt that this was a necessary complicating counter-narrative to a simplistic and largely Islamophobic post-9/11 American media landscape.\nThey came to renown in South Asia from songs they released in Punjabi, Urdu, and Hindi. Their filmed BBC session where the band covered Bollywood classic \"Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai\" especially got the band much positive attention from the Southern Asian and Punjabi peoples, both native and abroad.\nOne of their biggest hits is the song \"Tunnnnnn\", which is a re-interpretation of a classic reggae song; Willie Williams' \"Armagideon Time\". The lyrics of \"Tunnnnnn\" are a mashup of English, Urdu, and Punjabi. Its lyrics proclaim (in Urdu): \"We will only drink what they drink in Iraq! We will only drink what they drink in Karbala!\", touching upon the subject of the horrific reality of warfare and the bombs which were dropped on those places. \"Tunnnnnn\" was an instant hit with both Kominas fans and newcomers alike.\nWith the self-titled release \"Kominas\" in 2012, the band has adopted the more Americana rock elements grunge and garage rock in their style and moved away from writing about Muslim-centric issues.  From 2009\u20132012 the band toured extensively around America, Canada, and Europe. However, since 2012, the band's output has only been mostly daily missives on their Facebook page, which is more often than not, a commentary on the daily politics of race and religion.\nThe 2021 television series \"We Are Lady Parts\", written and directed by Nida Manzoor, used the song title \"Ain\u2019t No One Gonna Honour Kill My Sister But Me,\" pulled without permission from or attribution to The Kominas's track \"No One Gonna Honor Kill My Baby (but me)\" from their eponymous 2011 album.Though their commentary has remained political, many fans feel their music has grown less ethnocentric or religious-minded and has taken become more absurdist and nihilistic.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Street and Harris then formed a group together with Sandra and John Fagin.Their first release, as The Majestics, was to have been \"Hello Love\" on Motown's V.I.P. label in 1964, but release was cancelled. A year later, \"Say You\" was released initially as The Majestics, but a name change to The Monitors was made after it was found there was another group already recording as The Majestics for another company. \"Say You\" reached #36 on the Billboard R&B chart. \"Greetings (This is Uncle Sam)\" was their third release and reached #100 on Billboard's Pop Chart in 1966. The song explores the feelings felt by many young men, as they were drafted into the army to serve in the Vietnam War. Two more singles appeared on V.I.P., \"Since I Lost You Girl\" (November 1966) and \"Bring Back the Love\" (January 1968).

Richard Street, for example, worked in Motown's Quality Control department, and later traveled with The Temptations as a stand-in for Paul Williams, who became increasingly ill during the late 1960s and early 1970s due to alcoholism and other health problems. When Williams was forced to leave the Temptations in 1971 because of his failing health, Street took his place, and The Monitors were dissolved.\nBritish producer Ian Levine recorded a new version of The Monitors in the late 1980s, with lead singer Darrell Littlejohn (a nephew of Smokey Robinson), Warren Harris, Maurice Fagin, Herschel Hunter, and Leah Harris, but without Street.

He used to talk about the upper partials clashing together. It was very slow moving, it was much more about sounds slowly morphing into other sounds... It was... like what you would call electroacoustic improvisation now. His trio music, even though it had bass and drums, moved at a very slow pace. It had a sort of groove, but it was very different. And he operated differently. His rhetoric was very different. I don't think he ever thought of himself as a jazz musician; he just saw himself as a musician. He was a very dignified, incredibly brilliant guy. He would never lower himself to some mere label.\" Morris added: \"He was so brilliant in the way he spoke about things; it was impossible to dismiss it as just crazy talk. Even though at first it sounded like that, over time I understood what he was talking about, and we could have conversations. He used to say it was about evolution, that if we play things we haven't heard before, it will alter the biochemistry of the brain. He said that's what evolution is about...

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

On the subject of joining the band in 1989, Steve Hogarth said in a 2001 interview: \"At about the same time, Matt Johnson of The The asked me to play piano on his tour. I always say I had to make a choice between the most hip band in the world, and the least.\" In the same conversation, he said: \"We're just tired of the opinions of people who haven't heard anything we've done in ten years. A lot of what's spread about this band is laughable.\"Much of the band's enduring and unfashionable reputation stems from their emergence in the early 1980s as the most commercially successful band of the neo-prog movement, an unexpected revival of the progressive rock musical style that had fallen out of critical favour in the mid-1970s. Some early critics were quick to dismiss the band as clones of Peter Gabriel-era Genesis due to musical similarities, such as their extended songs, a prominent and Mellotron-influenced keyboard sound, vivid and fantastical lyrics and the equally vivid and fantastical artwork by Mark Wilkinson used for the sleeves of their albums and singles.  Lead singer Fish was also often compared with Gabriel due to his early vocal style and theatrical stage performances, which in the early years included wearing face paint.\n\nAs Jon Wilde summarised in Melody Maker in 1989: At the end of a strange year for pop music, Marillion appeared in November 1982 with \"Market Square Heroes\". There were many strange things about 1982, but Marillion were the strangest of them all. For six years, they stood out of time. Marillion were the unhippest group going.  As punk was becoming a distant echo, they appeared with a sound and an attitude that gazed back longingly to the age of Seventies pomp.  When compared to Yes, Genesis and ELP, they would take it as a compliment. The Eighties have seen some odd phenomena. But none quite as odd as Marillion. Along the way, as if by glorious fluke, they turned out some singles that everybody quietly liked \u2013 \"Garden Party\", \"Punch and Judy\" and \"Incommunicado\". By this time, Marillion did not need the support of the hip-conscious. They were massive. Perhaps the oddest thing about Marillion was that they became one of the biggest groups of the decade. They might have been an anomaly but they were monstrously effective.\nThe band's unfashionable reputation and image has often been mentioned in the media, even in otherwise positive reviews. In Q in 1987, David Hepworth wrote: \"Marillion may represent the inelegant, unglamorous, public bar end of the current Rock Renaissance but they are no less part of it for that. Clutching at Straws suggests that they may be finally coming in from the cold.\" In the same magazine in 1995, Dave Henderson wrote: \"It's not yet possible to be sacked for showing an affinity for Marillion, but has there ever been a band with a larger stigma attached?\" He also argued that if the album Afraid of Sunlight \"had been made by a new, no baggage-of-the-past combo, it would be greeted with open arms, hailed as virtual genius.\" In Record Collector in 2002, Tim Jones argued they were \"one of the most unfairly berated bands in Britain\" and \"one of its best live rock acts.\" In 2004, Classic Rock's Jon Hotten wrote: \"That genre thing has been a bugbear of Marillion's, but it no longer seems relevant. What are Radiohead if not a progressive band?\" and said Marillion were \"making strong, singular music with the courage of their convictions, and we should treasure them more than we do.\" In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, an article on Marillion written by Mick Wall described them as \"probably the most misunderstood band in the world\".\nIn 2007, Stephen Dalton of The Times stated: The band have just released their 14th album, Somewhere Else, which is really rather good. Containing tracks that shimmer like Coldplay, ache like Radiohead and thunder like Muse, it is better than 80 per cent of this month's releases. But you are unlikely to hear Marillion on British radio, read about them in the music press or see them play a major festival. This is largely because Marillion have \u2013 how can we put this kindly? \u2013 an image problem. Their music is still perceived as bloated, bombastic mullet-haired prog-rock, even by people who have never heard it. In fairness, they did once release an album called Script for a Jester's Tear. But, come on, we all had bad hair days in the 1980s.\nDespite publishing a very good review for their 1995 album Afraid of Sunlight and including it in their 50 Best Albums of 1995, Q refused to interview the band or write a feature on them. Steve Hogarth later said: \"How can they say, this is an amazing record... no, we don't want to talk to you? It's hard to take when they say, here's a very average record... we'll put you on the front cover.\"In 2001, the television critic of The Guardian, Gareth McLean, used his review of the Michael Lewis BBC Two documentary, Next: The Future Just Happened, to concentrate on launching a scathing attack on the band, whose appearance only constituted one segment of the programme. He described them as \"once dodgy and now completely rubbish\" and he characterised their fans as \"slightly simple folks\". He also dismissed the band's efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: \"One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion.\"Rachel Cooke, a writer for The Observer and New Statesman, has repeatedly referred negatively to the band and insulted their fans in her articles.\nIn an interview in 2000, Hogarth expressed regret about the band retaining their name after he joined: If we had known when I joined Marillion what we know now, we'd have changed the name and been a new band. It was a mistake to keep the name, because what it represented in the mid-Eighties is a millstone we now carry. If we'd changed it, I think we would have been better off. We would have been judged for our music. It's such a grave injustice that the media constantly calls us a 'dinosaur prog band'. They only say that out of ignorance because they haven't listened to anything we've done for the last 15 bloody years. If you hear anything we've done in the last five or six years, that description is totally irrelevant... It's a massive frustration that no-one will play our stuff. If we send our single to Radio 1 they say: 'Sorry, we don't play music by bands who are over so-many years old... and here's the new U2 single.' I suppose it's something everyone has to cope with \u2013 every band are remembered for their big hit single, irrespective of how much they change over the years. But you can only transcend that by continuing to have hits. It's Catch 22. You know, at some stage, someone has to notice that we're doing interesting things. Someday someone will take a retrospective look at us and be surprised.\nThe 2013 film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa includes a joke reference to a former drummer of the band. The band were quoted: \"We know Marillion are seen as 'uncool' but we were delighted to be a part of it.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Indeed, it seems not for the crowd at all: as background music this fades away, shrinking into a still corner away from the noise.\" They later said that \"Valtari seems rather brave: across a runtime of nearly an hour there's little effort to hold our attention, to vary the tone or venture anywhere, anywhere near mainstream appeal.

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

Looking for a new, creative sound, Rothchild hired Paul Harris to arrange string and orchestral arrangements for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and local jazz horn players. Session musicians Doug Lubahn and Harvey Brooks also served as additional bass guitarists. The music on The Soft Parade incorporated psychedelic rock, blues rock, art rock, jazz rock, pop rock and experimental styles. Drummer John Densmore and Manzarek, who both had jazz backgrounds, asserted they were receptive to Rothchild's jazz concept: \"We'd [Densmore and Manzarek] always talk about using some jazz musicians \u2013 let's put some horns and strings on, man, let's see what it would be like to record with a string section and a big horn section,\" recalled Manzarek.Although Morrison was less involved in the Doors' studio sessions at this point, he demanded the band receive individual writing credits after initially refusing to sing Krieger's lyric, \"Can't you see me growing, get your guns\" on the track \"Tell All the People\". As a result, The Soft Parade was the first Doors album to list band members separately rather than collectively as \"Songs by the Doors.\" Krieger continued to hone his songwriting skills to fill the void left by Morrison's absence. He wrote half of the album's tracks, while Morrison is credited with the other half (they share co-credits on \"Do It\"), ultimately creating an album that lacks the unified musical stance found in the Doors' early works.Krieger's songs, written almost independently from the rest of the band, most noticeably incorporated the jazz influences. Only his tracks, \"Tell All the People\", \"Touch Me\", \"Runnin' Blue\", and \"Wishful Sinful\", were written to include string and horn arrangements; Morrison, though not totally opposed to the concept, declined to go in the direction Densmore and Manzarek championed. \"Touch Me\" (penned under the working titles \"Hit Me\" and \"I'm Gonna Love You\") was chosen as the first single taken from The Soft Parade, becoming one of the Doors' biggest hits. The band brought in the saxophone player Curtis Amy to perform a solo instrumental on the song, which was influenced by the works of John Coltrane.Journalists Nathan Brackett and Christian Hoard found \"Wild Child\" as \"Morrison parodying himself.\" \"Shaman's Blues\" and the title track were both examples of the singer's penchant for using symbolism and autobiographical insights. The latter song, a stylistic return to a lengthy track closing a Doors album, was penned with the help of Rothchild, who organized pieces of Morrison's poetry with him to align rhythmically and conceptually. Introduced with a mock-fiery sermon by Morrison, \"The Soft Parade\" displays his Southern roots through his portrayal as a preacher.

Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child, MTV's James Montgomery noted that \"they have left a fairly sizable legacy behind\" as \"one of the best-selling female pop vocal groups in history.\" Billboard observed that Destiny's Child were \"defined by a combination of feisty female empowerment anthems, killer dance moves and an enviable fashion sense,\" while Essence noted that they \"set trends with their harmonious music and cutting-edge style.\" In 2015, Daisy Jones of Dazed Digital published an article on how the group made a significant impact in R&B music, writing \"Without a hint of rose tint, Destiny's Child legitimately transformed the sound of R&B forever... their distinct influence can be found peppered all over today's pop landscape, from Tinashe to Ariana Grande.\" Nicole Marrow of The Cut magazine believed that R&B music in the 1990s and early 2000s \"was virtually redefined by the success of powerhouse performers like TLC and Destiny's Child, who preached a powerful litany of embracing womanhood and celebrating individuality.\" Hugh McIntyre of Forbes wrote that before The Pussycat Dolls and Danity Kane burst onto the music scene in the mid-2000s, Destiny's Child were \"the reigning queens\" of the girl group genre.Writing for Pitchfork, Katherine St. Asaph noticed how Destiny's Child defined the revival of girl groups similar to The Supremes in the early-to-mid-'90s, saying:\n\nThere is no better microcosm of what happened to Top 40 music between 1993 and 1999 than this. Bands like the \u201cStar Search\u201d winner were buried in a landfill of post-grunge, while R&B groups built out from soul and quiet storm to create a sound innovative enough to earn the \u201cfuturistic\u201d label almost everything got in that pre-Y2K time. This bore itself out in the revival in the early-to-mid-\u201990s of excellent girl groups vaguely in the Supremes mold\u2014TLC, En Vogue, SWV\u2014but it would be Destiny\u2019s Child who would become their true successors.\nDestiny's Child's final lineup as a trio has been widely noted as the group's most recognizable and successful lineup. Billboard recognized them as one of the greatest musical trios of all time; they were also ranked as the third most successful girl group of all time on the Billboard charts, behind TLC and The Supremes. The group's single \"Independent Women\" (2000) ranked second on Billboard's list of the \"Top 40 Biggest Girl Group Songs of All Time on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart\". \"Independent Women\" was also acknowledged by the Guinness World Records as the longest-running number-one song on the Hot 100 by a girl group. The term \"Bootylicious\" (a combination of the words booty and delicious) became popularized by Destiny's Child's single of the same and was later added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006. The term was also used to describe Beyonc\u00e9 during the 2000s decade due to her curvaceous figure. VH1 included \"Bootylicious\" on their \"100 Greatest Songs of the '00s\" list in 2011, and Destiny's Child on their \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list the following year. Additionally, \"Independent Women\" was ranked as one of NME's \"100 Best Songs of the 00s\". Destiny's Child was honored at the 2005 World Music Awards with the World's Best Selling Female Group of All Time Award, which included a 17-minute tribute performance by Patti LaBelle, Usher, Babyface, Rihanna, Amerie and Teairra Mari. In 2006, the group was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Destiny's Child has been credited as a musical influence or inspiration by several artists including Rihanna, Meghan Trainor, Fifth Harmony, Little Mix, Girls Aloud, Haim, Jess Glynne, Katy B, and RichGirl. Ciara was inspired to pursue a career in music after seeing Destiny's Child perform on television. Ariana Grande cited Destiny's Child as one of her vocal inspirations, saying that listening to the group's music is how she discovered her range and \"learned about harmonies and runs and ad-libs.\" Meghan Trainor stated that her single \"No\" (2016) was inspired by the late 1990s and early 2000s sounds of Destiny's Child, NSYNC, and Britney Spears. Fifth Harmony cited Destiny's Child as their biggest inspiration, and even paid tribute to the group by performing a medley of \"Say My Name\", \"Independent Women\", \"Bootylicious\" and \"Survivor\" on the television show Greatest Hits.

Their musical style combines traditional music from all over the world and vocals with contemporary western synthesizer-based psychedelic music. When asked to describe Shpongle's music, Posford has responded that it is \"like nothing you've ever heard before.\"Shpongle's first track, \"Vapour Rumours\", was released on TIP Records' Infinite Excursions compilation in 1996.

Raja Ram stated in an interview that \"Shpongle\" is an umbrella term for feeling positive and euphoric emotions. Shpongle's music is heavily influenced by psychedelic experiences and frequently makes use of sonic textures that approximate psychedelic states as well as vocal samples relating to consciousness expansion, hallucinations, and altered states of awareness.

The only track from that album not to be approved of by the Russian authorities was the German wartime classic \"Lili Marleen\". The compilation features two tracks from Sweet Revenge and only one song from I Am a Photograph, omitting most of Lear's greatest hits of the disco era. While a number of flexi discs with Lear's recordings was released in both the Soviet Union and other parts of the Eastern Bloc during the 1980s, the Poet Amanda Lear compilation was one of the few releases to actually be pressed on vinyl and released with a proper picture sleeve. Originally released in 1981, the LP was re-issued a number of times up until 1990. It has been voted the 10th favourite album of 1981 in the Soviet Union.Along with The Beatles, ABBA and Boney M., Amanda Lear was one of the very few Western pop acts during the Cold War era to have her music officially released in the Soviet Union by Melodiya.

He accompanied her on the song \"I Just Don't Understand\" Fred Foster of Monument Records then booked McCoy for McCoy's second session, this time with Roy Orbison, which included the song, \"Candy Man\".

His ability to give a creditable performance on many different instruments made him a good man to have on any session, and he became known as the \"Utility Man\" by producers.

I suppose I had a secret desire to sing.\" They soon teamed up with bass guitarist Alex Keyser and drummer Andy Henderson, who had previously played with PJ Harvey's band. Guitarist Debbie Smith, formerly of Curve, came on board in 1994. According to the Epic Records' website, the group came up with the name Echobelly from the notion of \"being hungry for something\". With Madan and Johansson as the band's songwriters, they recorded their debut EP, Bellyache, on the independent Pandemonium label in late 1993.The favourable response to Bellyache helped Echobelly secure a recording contract with Rhythm King, which was then part of Epic. Once on board the label, the group released the \"I Can't Imagine the World Without Me\" single in June 1994. The group then recorded the album Everyone's Got One, which included the single \"Insomniac\" and reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart. The single was featured in the film and soundtrack of Dumb and Dumber.\nAs their music received more airplay, Echobelly won admiration from other artists as well. Madonna expressed interest in putting them on her Maverick label (existing contractual arrangements prevented that), and R.E.M. requested the group as the opening act for their upcoming tour. The band returned to the studio in 1995 to create their next album, On, produced by Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie, who had also produced Hole and Radiohead.\nMadan's lyrics often ventured into the less explored side of life, addressed in songs such as \"King of the Kerb\". and \"Dark Therapy\". \"I wanted to challenge myself as a lyricist on a different level on this album,\" Madan said in Rolling Stone. \"I want people to tell me what they thought the lyrics are about. I'm not a politician. I'm not interested in changing everybody around me. I'm interested in myself.\"\nWhile many of the songs lamented the state of things, others on the On album celebrated the endless possibilities of the human spirit. In \"Great Things\", Madan sang \"I want to do great things / I don't want to compromise / I want to know what love is / I want to know everything.\" The album's mostly optimistic feel provides an intriguing contrast with its serious subject matter. As Pareles wrote, \"Both music and lyrics examine the tension between order and liberty\". Listeners in the UK responded favourably to the album, driving three singles from the release into the Top 30 of the UK Singles Chart. Sales of the album rose to over 150,000 in the UK, nearly double that of Everyone's Got One.\nHealth and legal problems interrupted the success of Echobelly in 1995 and 1996. Madan had a serious thyroid problem during her world tour that was potentially life-threatening, but was later cured. Bass guitarist James Harris joined after Keyser defected because of personal and artistic differences. The group also had disagreements with Rhythm King after the label moved to Arista. The band chose to stay with Epic. In 1996, Madan also ventured away from the group when she sang on a recording of the club band, Lithium. Smith left the band before the release of the band's third album Lustra, which was produced by Gil Norton and issued in November 1997. A single from the album, \"The World is Flat\", was released in August of that year.A four-year hiatus was brought to an end in 2001 when the band returned with the Digit EP and their fourth album, People Are Expensive (produced by Ben Hillier), which were released on their own Fry Up label.

He used to talk about the upper partials clashing together. It was very slow moving, it was much more about sounds slowly morphing into other sounds... It was... like what you would call electroacoustic improvisation now. His trio music, even though it had bass and drums, moved at a very slow pace. It had a sort of groove, but it was very different.

He was a very dignified, incredibly brilliant guy. He would never lower himself to some mere label.\" Morris added: \"He was so brilliant in the way he spoke about things; it was impossible to dismiss it as just crazy talk. Even though at first it sounded like that, over time I understood what he was talking about, and we could have conversations.

I understand that what he was really trying to do was to move humans forward.\" Regarding Davidson's funeral, Morris stated: \"The music played by the church band circled and rose to the ceiling. The sounds clashed and blended. The partials merged.

The artist is driven to pursue and formulate successive objective forms. That is the only way to cross the river and stay alive in the current.

He mentioned as well how the band Fall Out Boy said in an interview that they did not really know much about Jesus until Anberlin toured with them.In an interview with Smartpunk, drummer Nathan Young commented, \"The thing is, some bands that are trying to get out of the Christian market, they get bummed out by questions about it. I don\u2019t really mind it, because I\u2019m a Christian, and I\u2019m okay talking about it. With the whole term 'Christian Band,' I don\u2019t understand how a band can be Christian.

As prince, he was a diligent governor of royal domains, seeking to repopulate devastated regions in Georgian Armenia, while seating on his father's royal council, assisting him in leading Georgian forces against Ottoman incursions, and representing him in diplomatic negotiations to bring peace to Western Georgia. However, he had to face the ambitions of his step-mother Queen Darejan and her sons, ambitions that would grow into open tensions and a 1794 deal in which King Heraclius changed the law of succession to make George's younger brothers next in line after George.\nTaking over after his father's death in 1798, he sought closer relations with Russian Empire as a guarantee to secure his succession, especially after reverting the 1794 deal and appointing his son David as crown prince. This led to a civil war, with the king's younger brothers rebelling, and Russia dispatching troops in 1799 to restore peace in Kartl-Kakheti. An astute diplomat, he also sought alliances with Persia and the Ottoman Empire and was proposed a military partnership by Napoleon, but was forced to use Russia's power to prevent further devastations of his kingdom by his southern neighbors.\nWeakened by illness, he was considered a failed monarch, paralyzed by paranoia, who could not put an end to the constant rebellions of his brothers. The poor economic state of the country led to a collapse in bureaucracy and a rise in crime, while he failed to implement any of the major public, financial, and educational reforms his son Ioane proposed. Supporting his kingdom's integration into the Russian Empire, he trusted Russian diplomats without realizing their own role in dividing Georgian nobility. In 1800, he secured from Emperor Paul I an approval of what his \"Petitionary Articles\", which provided for Eastern Georgia's integration into Russia as an autonomous kingdom, although he died without knowing about its ratification. His death opened the doors for Russia to break its agreements and fully annex Georgia.", "hasanswer": false}]}

While studying at the California Institute of the Arts, Edge became influenced in making unusual sounds; this progressed after a trip to Morocco where he heard a lot of Arabic music. In his head, he began putting a beat behind the music and started coming up with ideas for songs. Chrome's music contained a lot of atmosphere in the sound production, featuring three- and eight-note melodies, usually layered with an atonal drone backed by a rhythm section. This sort of atmosphere was influenced by the music he had heard in Morocco. About six months after that trip, Edge began forming a band and recording his new music.Chrome took part of their inspiration for their rough and sometimes chaotic music from punk pioneers like the Stooges. They recorded and released their first album, The Visitation, along with John Lambdin (guitar) and Mike Low (guitar, vocals). After recording The Visitation, Edge sent the album to Warner Brothers to see if they wanted to release the album. A Warner Brothers A&R representative told Edge that the album sounded like a \"messed up Doors album\"; to Damon Edge, this was a compliment. The label did not release the album, so Edge set up his own label, Siren Records. After the recording of the first album, singer Mike Low left the band, to be replaced by new guitarist Helios Creed.Chrome's commercial and artistic breakthrough came in 1977 with their second album, Alien Soundtracks. The album began as Ultra Soundtrack, a soundtrack for a radical San Francisco strip show, but was rejected for being too radical. During recording, Chrome, aided by Creed's input, largely abandoned conventional rock compositions, instead employing cut-up and collage techniques and heavily processed sound to create a kind of sci-fi punk style. The album was given 4 out of 5 stars in the UK music paper Sounds, and Chrome began gradually to gain a cult reputation in the UK and in Europe.\nAfter recording Alien Soundtracks, John Lambdin left the band. Their third studio album, Half Machine Lip Moves, was released in 1979. Half Machine Lip Moves continued in the vein of the previous album, but heavier, with Creed's feedback guitar more to the fore. Edge's rough and ready drumming on this album included hitting pieces of scrap metal. Half Machine Lip Moves remains their best-known work. It was listed at No. 62 in The Wire list of \"100 Records That Set the World on Fire (While No One Was Listening)\", and was cited as the \"beginning of industrial rock\".Half Machine Lip Moves and their 1979 EP Read Only Memory cemented the band's growing reputation in the UK and led to the band being signed to Beggars Banquet Records for their fourth album, Red Exposure. By this time Chrome consisted solely of Edge and Creed. The album marked a move away from the more frenetic style of the two previous albums, with more use of drum machines and synthesizers.\nIn 1980, Edge met singer Fabienne Shine, formerly of the band Shakin' Street, and married her two months later. She went on to collaborate with him on several Chrome albums; her vocals appear on the album 3rd from the Sun.\nAfter a further EP and single, Chrome again expanded to a quartet with the addition of the new rhythm section of John and Hilary Stench (real surname: Hanes). This lineup existed circa 1980\u20131983, and produced the albums Blood on the Moon (1981) and 3rd from the Sun (1982), and the new material comprising the fifth LP of the 1982 Chrome Box set (subtitled Chronicles I and Chronicles II). The Chronicles material was also released in France as an album titled Raining Milk, and would later be reissued in much longer versions on the distinct albums Chronicles I and Chronicles II. The title track from 3rd from the Sun was covered by the band Prong on their 1989 album Beg to Differ.\nIn 1983, Edge moved to Paris. Shine introduced him to her band and a new lineup of Chrome was formed. Edge and his wife would later separate. Edge continued to release albums with various (mainly Europe-based) musicians under the Chrome moniker over the next decade.\nIn August 1995, Edge was found dead in his Redondo Beach apartment in California; the cause of death was heart failure. Edge had been in contact with Creed and talked about reforming Chrome.Alternative Press included Chrome in their 1996 list of \"100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years.\"After she and Edge separated, Shine continued to compose songs. In 1997, after Edge's death, she released an album titled No Mad Nomad. The title referred to her late husband. In 2004, she began working and touring again with Creed.A Creed-led version of Chrome that featured previous members John and Hilary Stench released a series of albums and toured between 1997 and 2001. Creed later reactivated the Chrome name again, issuing a new album, Feel It Like a Scientist, in 2014.\nThe group's next album, Techromancy, was released April 21, 2017, followed by a US tour.As of 2018, Chrome's current line-up consisted of Creed, Tommy Grenas, Aleph Omega, Lux Vibratus, Lou Minatti and Steve Fishman.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It received praise for the decisions to experiment with dubstep, bubblegum pop and electronic music on some of the tracks and criticism towards the ballads, with critics divided over the number on one album and their quality versus the more up-tempo songs. Ludovic Hunter-Tilney from the Financial Times found that although there was still a \"preponderance of Adele-aping break-up songs\", the delays in releasing Glassheart had worked in Lewis' favour by forcing her to \"confront her lack of [musical] direction\". Hunter-Tilney praised both the Mariah Carey-styled vocals and use of \"echoing snare drums\" in many of the songs, concluding that Lewis' singing \"has an extra edge to it\" while the music \"strays out of her comfort zone\". The Daily Mirror's Dean Piper also noted similarities to Adele, commenting that although both Lewis and Adele had worked with Smith, Lewis' album would \"not translate to a universal audience\" like Adele's 21 had. However Piper did call the comparison unfair because Glassheart \"reminds you what an extraordinary talent Leona is\", also saying \"there's no doubting the music is good and Glassheart does appear to be her most personal album to date.\" Amongst the songs Piper picked out were \"Un Love Me\", \"Favourite Scar\" and \"Fingerprint\". Another positive review came from Digital Spy's Lewis Corner who said that Lewis surprised on \"the pacey numbers full of angst and torment that standout\". Commending her falsetto, Corner awarded Lewis five out of five stars and ended by saying \"Like many artists before her, Leona has channelled the darker side of love's grasp into her work \u2013 and the result is nothing short of spectacular.\"Matthew Horton writing for Virgin Media praised Lewis for experimenting with dubstep on \"Come Alive\" and bubblegum pop on \"Shake You Up\", describing both songs as experiments that work. Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian newspaper picked up on the album's composition and described it as too heavily reliant on ballads, saying the issue was that it was \"an area where Adele now has the advantage.\" However Sullivan did say that \"for once Lewis has made an album that's worth turning up \u2013 in parts, at least.\" She praised \"Come Alive\", \"Glassheart\" and \"Trouble\". Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music gave the album a mixed review saying that Glassheart \"largely plays up to expectations\". He criticised the subject matter, noting that many of the songs revisit familiar territory on how \"she is always unlucky in love, unless she is swooning in melancholy bliss.\" McAlpine praised the production values, noting that \"over the course of these 12 songs there are all sorts of production nods to happier music\" but also pointing out that on most songs \"[Lewis] sounds devastated.\" In part \"it's her natural tone of voice\", McAlpine concluded, as well as noting that there were not really any up-tempo songs, just songs that were not ballads, but adding that it did not matter as \"the songs that tend to fly best, on their own terms at least, are the uncluttered muscle ballads.\" Commenting on \"Come Alive\", he stated that although the \"breakbeat\" production is one of the \"happier\" ones on the album, Lewis sounds \"eternally downcast\". The Independent's Hugh Montgomery gave the album a mixed review, saying that \"obviously there's still swathes of antiseptic balladry best described as 'music to fold towels by'.\" However, not all of his review was negative. Montgomery said the album attempted to make Lewis \"current again\" by including songs penned by Sand\u00e9, a \"Bond theme manqu\u00e9\" and \"obviously and actually rather effectively, some dubstep\". Critics Robert Copsey and Lewis Corner from Digital Spy put Glassheart at number nine in their top 20 albums of 2012, writing that despite being renowned for ballads, \"it's the pacey numbers full of angst and torment that stand out.\" Later in a poll of 25,000 people, conducted by Digital Spy, readers voted Glassheart the fifth best album of 2012 with 9.8% share of the vote, behind Sand\u00e9's Our Version of Events, Babel by Mumford and Sons, Lana Del Rey's Born to Die and Fall to Grace by Paloma Faith.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Dulcinea was RIAA Certified Gold on September 1, 1994 and Platinum on July 31, 1995.\nThe album's name is a reference to the love interest in Miguel de Cervantes' classic Spanish novel, Don Quixote.

The album's artwork (illustrated by artist Jason Holley) also explores Cervantes' windmill metaphor, depicting the incongruence between the way things are and how people tend to perceive them.\nDulcinea also delves into some spiritual themes. \"Fly from Heaven\" is sung from the perspective of James, who is portrayed as Jesus's literal brother and is upset by Paul's manipulation of Jesus's word. \"Begin\" and \"Reincarnation Song\" each explore questions about death and the afterlife.\nGlen Phillips has said that Dulcinea is probably his favorite Toad album because they started to know what they were doing but were not overthinking things yet.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

The album was made with the assistance of Phil Kaye, a sound effects virtuoso who worked with Elliott on the Tom and Jerry cartoons.[1]\nThe subtitle that appeared on the front cover of the LP (which also featured three young women striking arguably sultry poses with saxophones and congas atop a cement truck) captured the basic goals, sound, and feel of the album quite well:\n\nA Sonic Spectacular Presenting MUSIC!

A track from the album (\"Will You Still Be Mine\") was later anthologized on one of Rhino Records' influential Cocktail Mix CDs.  As the space age pop/lounge revival grew in popularity, two more tracks from the album (\"You're the Top\" and \"The Lonesome Road\") were anthologized on one of the many volumes of Capitol Records' Ultra-Lounge series.The album was out of print for decades and wasn\u2019t officially available on CD until 2001, when Dutch label Basta Music [2], known for their reissues of Raymond Scott material, released what was described as an official, legitimate CD release of Zounds! transferred directly from the Capitol master tapes.[3].

Upon its re-release in 2011, Jess Harvell of Pitchfork called it \"their most focused and purely pleasurable record\", and \"a strong and lovable essay on 90s indie's charms\".

The Last Resort's lead singer, Roi Pearce (later of The 4-Skins) liked the band and agreed to produce a two-song demo tape with them. These sessions resulted in the songs \"Soldier\" and \"Combat 84\", which were favourably received in the music press, leading to the band being described as 'the new Sham 69'.In 1982, the manager of The 4-Skins, Gary Hitchcock attempted to get the band signed to Secret Records, then home to The 4-Skins, The Business, Infa Riot and The Exploited, although the deal fell through at the last minute, prompting Combat 84 to sign to Victory Records for the release of their Orders of the Day EP. Former Business drummer John Fisher replaced Brownie for the recording of the second (1983) EP, Rapist.\nMore right-leaning, lyrically than many of their punk rock and Oi! peers, Combat 84 received much criticism for recording a song that advocated capital punishment for rapists (\"Rapist\"), and a song that supported nuclear weapons and criticised the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and reds (\"Right to Choose\"). Guitarist Jim stated in a 2000 interview that the latter song was intended in a tongue-in-cheek manner, and as a homage to Vietnam War movies. The song Politically Incorrect attacked several targets, including beggars, foreign aid, the Guardian, lesbians and women's liberation. Other lyrical themes included unemployment, inner-city violence, war, and slavish followers of fashion.\nControversy erupted around the band after they were featured in a 1982 BBC Arena documentary, during which Henderson alleged that the police were tougher on White skinheads than they were on Black rioters, said that \"there will never be racial harmony\" and blamed the Asians for the 1981 Southall riot, during which the band were attacked inside a gig venue. Deptford John briefly made some comments in agreement with Henderson over the riots but, in a later part of the documentary, he said that skinheads should be able to empathise with Blacks when they are denied jobs or entrance to venues, and should remember that, whereas skinheads can change how they look, Blacks cannot change their skin colour. Footage of crowd violence at a gig in Harlow was broadcast at the end of the documentary. This led to the break-up of the band, as their newly earned bad reputation discouraged venues from booking the band. Gigs were then often played under the pseudonym The 7th Cavalry to avoid the stigma of the Combat 84 name.Victory Records, wanting little to do with the band at this point, compiled an album of studio recordings (intended for the band's debut album) and bootleg-quality live tracks and licensed it to German label Rock-O-Rama Records for release as Send in the Marines in 1984. The record was disowned by the band, which split up soon after.In the intervening years, Combat 84 were frequently labelled as a neo-Nazi, white power or Rock Against Communism (RAC) band, a charge which has been denied by 'Deptford' John and Jim, noting that the band's songs contained no racist lyrics, nor were they ever aligned with any far-right political party. The band's reputation was made worse by the similarity in name to a neo-Nazi group called Combat 18. 'Deptford' John was able to retain a career by joining The Exploited, whose lyrics on certain issues were different to Combat 84 (e.g. The Exploited were against nuclear weapons), but John noted in a 2001 interview with the \"Pissed and Proud\" fanzine that he believes in free speech and whilst not supporting it, that RAC music should be allowed a platform as \"people should be allowed to say what they want\". In his book, Chris Henderson said that the 84 in the name was a reference to George Orwell's book 1984 and that the band adhered to the philosophy of George Orwell.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The New York Times columnist Jeff Leeds noted that the releases could benefit from the holiday season, but \"it could also hinder their efforts to establish themselves as recording artists with distinctive personalities and the legitimacy needed for long careers.\" Clive Davis reiterated that the release was intended to recede from their ties from American Idol, saying, \"I'm not interested in merely souvenir sales\". The album was titled Breakaway to capitalize on the success of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement soundtrack single \"Breakaway\", which was also reissued as the album's final single. Immediately before the album was released, Clarkson left 19 Management, dismissed Fuller as her manager, and quickly hired the managing services of Jeff Kwatinetz of The Firm, though still contracted to 19 Recordings. A promotion plan was created for Clarkson for Breakaway's release. Davis positioned her to be RCA's top global priority, and at the recommendation of The Firm, removed American Idol from her official biography. Rather than being booked on arenas for her tour, Kwatinetz booked Clarkson for smaller amphitheaters to hone her performance skills. He remarked, \"American Idol gave her a lot of exposure that allowed her to skip some steps in her development, and that's hazardous.\" Breakaway was first released internationally on January 3, 2005, by the Bertelsmann Music Group (now Sony Music Entertainment), and was released in the United Kingdom on July 18, 2005, by RCA.

This included the influence of classic rock on the band's music, their use of feedback, extreme volume as well as loud-quiet dynamic, combined with Mascis's droning vocals. A characteristic of Mascis's vocal style is frequent use of vocal fry. Gerald Cosloy, head of Homestead Records, summarized the band's music: \"It was its own bizarre hybrid. ... It wasn't exactly pop, it wasn't exactly punk rock\u2014it was completely its own thing\".Mascis listened to classic rock artists such as the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, elements of which were incorporated into Dinosaur Jr.'s sound. In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as The Birthday Party, and has frequently noted Nick Cave as an influence. Dinosaur Jr. combined elements of hardcore punk and noise rock into their songs, which often featured a large amount of feedback, distortion and extreme volume. When the master tape of You're Living All Over Me arrived at SST, the label's production manager noticed the level on the tape was so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed it was the way he wanted the album to sound.Similar to Mascis's guitar work, Barlow's bass lines with their alternating heavily distorted, fast chords and pulverizing lows, draw heavily from both his hardcore past and musicians such as Lemmy and Johnny Ramone. On his influences, Barlow stated that \"...Johnny Ramone is my hero. I wanted to make that rhythmic chugging sound like he got playing guitar with the Ramones. And, I found that I got a bigger sound by strumming farther up the neck.\"Mascis's vocals are another distinctive feature of Dinosaur Jr.'s music. He attributed his \"whiny low-key drawl\", the opposite of the hardcore punk \"bark\", to artists such as John Fogerty and Mick Jagger. His style also resembled Neil Young's, but Mascis disputed this and later commented: \"That got annoying, being compared all the time.\" His drawl epitomized the band's slacker ethos and relaxed attitude; author Michael Azerrad said \"even Mascis seemed removed from the feelings he was conveying in the music.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

For more than 40 years, this freakadelic folk-rock band... had lasting influence on fans wild and crazy enough to be in on the acquired-taste secret of their art.\" Writing for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger called the band \"almost the very definition of a cult act... Their audience was small because their music was too strange, idiosyncratic, and at times downright dissonant for mainstream listeners to abide.\"The band's frequent drug use as well as Stampfel and Weber's creative differences also hindered a breakthrough. Peter Stampfel reflected that \"there was just too much drugs, alcohol, and bad attitude in the band\" to \"capitalize on our positive aspects.\" NPR noted that the band exhibited \"self-destructive behavior\" that led to an early breakup and an inability to capitalize on the inclusion of \"Bird Song\" on Easy Rider's commercially successful soundtrack. Dave Van Ronk thought similarly: \"that was their moment right there. If they had been able to capitalize on [Easy Rider], they would have been two very very wealthy men. But somehow or another it just didn't happen.\" The band's former road manager Jack Gallagher recalled in the early 2000s that \"managing them was like herding snakes\" but put the band's lack of success more squarely on Weber, questioning whether Weber would even complete the band's current tour and saying that Weber \"never crashes until the money gets real good.\"Despite the band's lack of critical and commercial success during their initial run in the 1960s and 1970s, they have since earned significant praise, in particular for their groundbreaking reworking of 1920s and 1930s folk music. While the Rounders famously were the first to use \"psychedelic\" in popular music, music journalist Greil Marcus also used the Holy Modal Rounders as the earliest example of old American music being reinvented with modern aesthetics, commenting that they were \"incapable of taking anything seriously, but nevertheless [got] to the bottom of folk songs other people sang as if they were obvious.\" The band has frequently been lumped into what Marcus coined as \"old weird America,\" which refers to the type of music Bob Dylan recorded for The Basement Tapes. Michael Simmons also noted the band's trail-blazing aesthetics, saying that \"the story of the Rounders is one of the grand secret histories of 20th-century American music. If music history is often a game of Who Came First?, then the Rounders can be said to be the first psychedelic hippie freak band and the first aggressively anti-purist folkies, making them a crucial missing link between early- and late-20th-century pop.\" The band's first two albums have been called early forerunners of the genre freak folk, with music critic Robert Christgau commenting \"freak folk started here.\" The band's two psychedelic albums are also of historical significance, with The New York Times saying that they \"still stand as extreme examples of acid-tinged folk music.\"Writing for New Haven Independent, Eleanor Polak discussed how the band had not just had significant influence, but that they had also inspired \"countless other musicians to take deep dives into American folk music to find the dark and weird within.\" Music critic Eric Weisbard, writing for  Spin in 1999, commented that after the band helped the folk scene rediscover many great \"blues and Appalachian singers\" in the 1960s, \"it's time the tables were turned--it's time for the rediscovery of the Holy Modal Rounders.\" Stampfel in particular was singled out for praise, with Weisbard declaring \"Stampfel has become to roots music what Jon Langford is to  punk: the patron saint of lost causes and good times in spite of them.\" Robert Christgau had similar high praise, believing that the Holy Modal Rounders, like Bob Dylan, \"greatly transcend\" the New York folk scene they began in and that \"next to Bob Dylan, Stampfel is the closest thing to a genius\" to come out of the 1960s folk revival. Christgau also praised Weber, calling him an \"ace guitarist\" who \"can just not give a fuck while remaining both charming and musical.\" Jason Weiss observed that \"from the start, [Weber] was recognized for his technique and divine spontaneity he brought to old-time music.\" The New York Times also noted Weber's \"mastery of traditional guitar styles.\"Rounder Records was named partially as a tribute to the Holy Modal Rounders.

The only full-out dance-pop song on the album is \"Your Love\", and on the deluxe version, \"Cold World\". The rest of the songs are a mix of \"urban\" pop, R&B, soul, and even some experimental PBR&B on the song \"Heartbreaker\". Nicole's vocals on the songs \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Electric Blue\" in particular, were compared to those of Janet Jackson. \"Electric Blue\" was compared to Janet Jackson's album The Velvet Rope (1997) for the similar production, and Nicole's sweet, soft, soothing, silky,  sexy, smooth vocals. The song \"Bang\" was compared to the work of Ciara, specifically her Basic Instinct album (2010), which both The-Dream and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart also produced. \"Just a Girl\" is a \"throwback to 90's R&B\" with its production. \"Girl With a Diamond Heart\" mixes dance-pop and R&B. \"First Time\" is features a more traditional pop and R&B sound. \"Little Boy\" is a soulful ballad that is mostly free of a beat to put the focus on Nicole's vocals and lyrics. It was described as one of the most soulful songs on the album, and a mistake to only have it on the deluxe version of the album. In sound, it is similar to The-Dream's own song \"Fancy\", and Kelly Rowland's song \"Keep It Between Us\". The lyrics speak of wanting somebody that you can't have, and wanting them so much that you forget what you have already. \"Unison\" is a \"feel good\" chilled R&B track. \"God of War\" is a dark \"angry\" R&B-ish ballad, similar to the work of The Weeknd.

Patrick Adams, who was A&R director of the label was also the band's manager. Burgess frequently collaborated with Adams in writing songs.\nThe group scored a number of R&B hits in the 1970s, including \"Don't Turn Around\" (a top 40 R&B hit released in 1969), \"You And I\", \"I'll Find a Way (The Loneliest Man in Town)\", \"Spinning Around\", \"What Goes Around (Comes Around)\" and \"Will We Ever Come Together\". Though they recorded several uptempo tracks, such as \"Big Apple Rock\", \"Walking Downtown (On a Saturday Night)\", \"What Goes Around (Comes Around)\" and, later, \"Mainline\" (written by Burgess, but recorded after he left the group), Black Ivory faced tough competition from the rise of disco, but proved unable to compete when disco became the dominant music style. However, \"Mainline\" broke through the group's difficulties of creating a hit dance record and has since become an internationally revered dance classic.\nAs a solo artist, Burgess had numerous club hits, beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s including \"Let's Do It\", \"Fire Night Dance\", \"Heartbreaker\", \"Stranger\" and \"You Got That Something\". Burgess chose to take a hiatus from Black Ivory in 1977, and developed several bands of his own, which include Convertion and LOGG, before joining twins TaharQa and TundeRa Aleem as their Lead vocalist Aleem, which had R&B songs such as \"Love's on Fire\"(1986), \"Confusion\", \"Release Yourself\", and \"Hooked On Your Love\". A 1991 release by the band titled \"Running After You\" received favourable reviews on release. He also continued to work with producer Adams in various studio groups. In addition to the hits he had with Aleem, Burgess was featured vocalist with Adams' groups Bumble Bee Unlimited, Logg, Inner Life (which also featured Jocelyn Brown), the Universal Robot Band, the Peter Jacques Band, Dazzle and M.O.D.E. (with whom he recorded \"Heaven\"), and did lead vocals on \"Much Too Much\" by Phreek.\n\"Burgess has a long and storied career in American R&B and disco\".Burgess wrote and produced a substantial number of hits for other artists as well, including \"Big Time\" for Rick James, and wrote and performed on the Bob Blank production of Fonda Rae's hit \"Over Like A Fat Rat\". He also sang background and played keyboard on many of the productions., He also co-composed (with James Calloway and Sonny T. Davenport) \"Stomp Your Feet\" by Herbie Mann and \"Never Used to Dance\" by Eddie Kendricks.\nHe supplied vocals for the Cassius tracks \"Under Influence\" and \"Til We Got You And Me\", from their album Au R\u00eave.\nBurgess is a contributing writer on Wu-Tang Clan rapper, Raekwon's single, Criminology off of his 1995 hit album \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...\".

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

The group, led by Brown and Halliwell, was adamant that the debut song should be \"Wannabe\", they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and the Girl Power statement. Virgin's executives believed that the first single should either be \"Say You'll Be There\", which they considered a much \"cooler\" track, or \"Love Thing\". At the beginning of 1996 the impasse between the group and their record label about the release of the single was temporarily solved. In March, Fuller announced that he agreed with Virgin in that \"Wannabe\" should not be the first single. The label wanted a song that appealed to the mainstream market, and nothing considered too radical. Halliwell was shocked and furious; she told Fuller, \"It's not negotiable as far as we're concerned.

As a scientist-musician he believed that musical tones, if properly employed, could influence the evolution of the brain.\"Joe Morris recalled: \"His music was much more about sound. He used to talk about the upper partials clashing together. It was very slow moving, it was much more about sounds slowly morphing into other sounds... It was... like what you would call electroacoustic improvisation now. His trio music, even though it had bass and drums, moved at a very slow pace. It had a sort of groove, but it was very different. And he operated differently. His rhetoric was very different. I don't think he ever thought of himself as a jazz musician; he just saw himself as a musician. He was a very dignified, incredibly brilliant guy. He would never lower himself to some mere label.\" Morris added: \"He was so brilliant in the way he spoke about things; it was impossible to dismiss it as just crazy talk. Even though at first it sounded like that, over time I understood what he was talking about, and we could have conversations. He used to say it was about evolution, that if we play things we haven't heard before, it will alter the biochemistry of the brain. He said that's what evolution is about... I understand that what he was really trying to do was to move humans forward.\" Regarding Davidson's funeral, Morris stated: \"The music played by the church band circled and rose to the ceiling. The sounds clashed and blended. The partials merged.

The artist is driven to pursue and formulate successive objective forms. That is the only way to cross the river and stay alive in the current. It is a form of achievement and 'success' that is incomprehensible to the normative path because it comes at great personal cost, [does not] include social status, accumulation of material goods, praise and adulation, or even a supportive social network.

He told The Observer: \"I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things, and I sort of felt like that the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that.\"Yorke suffered from writer's block and could not finish writing songs on guitar. He became disillusioned with the \"mythology\" of rock music, feeling the genre had \"run its course\". He began to listen almost exclusively to the electronic music of artists signed to the record label Warp, such as Aphex Twin and Autechre. Yorke said: \"It was refreshing because the music was all structures and had no human voices in it. But I felt just as emotional about it as I'd ever felt about guitar music.\" He liked the idea of his voice being used as an instrument rather than having a leading role, and wanted to focus on sounds and textures instead of traditional songwriting.Yorke bought a house in Cornwall and spent his time walking the cliffs and drawing, restricting his musical activity to playing the grand piano he had recently bought. \"Everything in Its Right Place\" was the first song he wrote. He described himself as a \"shit piano player\", with little knowledge of electronic instruments: \"I remember this Tom Waits quote from years ago, that what keeps him going as a songwriter is his complete ignorance of the instruments he's using. So everything's a novelty. That's one of the reasons I wanted to get into computers and synths, because I didn't understand how the fuck they worked. I had no idea what ADSR meant.\"The guitarist Ed O'Brien had hoped Radiohead's fourth album would comprise short, melodic guitar songs, but Yorke said: \"There was no chance of the album sounding like that. I'd completely had it with melody. I just wanted rhythm. All melodies to me were pure embarrassment.\" The bassist, Colin Greenwood, said: \"We felt we had to change everything. There were other guitar bands out there trying to do similar things. We had to move on.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Rabidoux and Beadle were veterans of the local hardcore scene, and had broken away from their respective bands out of a need to try something new musically. Their initial plans were to find a vocalist and bassist, but after recruiting Frattini, decided to remain an instrumental trio.\nTheir style draws heavily upon 70s progressive rock, particularly King Crimson and Yes, as well as fusion, hardcore, and math rock.  Their first self-titled 3 song EP was released in 2001, consisting of 2 studio tracks and 1 live track. Their 9 song full-length debut The Audio Medium followed in 2002.  The album explored a number of sonic landscapes, and revolved around the concept of the corporate music industry's control of the masses; that people are sheep to what music corporations and radio stations tell them to listen to, unaware of the real music that exists out there.  As in the medical world, a \"cancer conspiracy\" that hides the cure for cancer for the purpose of making money from the sick.  The album booklet contained a letter from a doctor by the name of Dr. Travis John, who shared similar views and who warned the band of the trouble they were getting themselves into.\nThe band toured extensively with bandmates on their label Big Wheel Recreation, and also opened for Oysterhead's first tour. Their shows were sometimes augmented by video projections.  In 2003, while at a show in New York City, their van was stolen, along with all of their equipment.  This was the last and most disastrous in a series of mishaps that had plagued their tours.  They decided to call it a day in late 2003.

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly acknowledge that the album \"does represent a victory for Lopez by offering fairly persuasive proof that, contrary to rumor, she can sing, and without a regiment of background choralists.\" However he noticed that \"[a]ll that bulking up she\u2019s been doing at the vocal gym isn\u2019t enough, though, to turn flaccid torch songs into muscle.\" Chuck Arnold of People gave the album a rating of two-and-a-half-out-of-four-stars, and praised the \"writing, production and vocal help\" from Marc Anthony, who made Lopez \"smoothly transforms into Jenny from the Barrio.\" However, he criticized the album's second half for being \"dragged down by too many ballads, which, no matter what tongue they're sung in, will never be Lopez's strong suit.\"In his AllMusic review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine was less favorable, calling it \"music for housewives\" and that \"it's by far the most sedate Lopez has ever been on record.\" Erlewine was less negative about her vocals though, writing that \"[s]he acquits herself well as a vocalist -- she never indulges in vocal gymnastics, and she can carry a tune strongly.\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine opined that \"Lopez\u2019s vocal shortcomings notwithstanding, she sounds surprisingly relaxed and at ease throughout [the album],\" but he found a problem with the fact that, according to him, \"Lopez easily ages herself by a decade or two,\" calling it \"shockingly middle-of-the-road\" and \"something that\u2019s close to Lopez\u2019s heart, but it\u2019s a less than shrewd move for one of pop culture\u2019s savviest icons.\" While recognizing that her vocals never lack feeling or conviction, Vibe's Pete L'Official called its music \"tacky and overproduced\", but observed that \"[t]he songwriting here far outstrips Lopez's previous albums, though.\" John Cruz of Sputnikmusic was negative in his review, feeling that Lopez \"forgets to bring the flavor of the language itself,\" naming it \"tepid and dull\" and noting that it lacked \"any sort of spice,\" calling it \"one of the years most disappointing albums,\" while Q magazine labeled it \"[s]loppy, emotion-free, chicken-in-a-basket ballad.\"In a retrospective review for Albumism, music critic Quentin Harrison remarked positively, \"The contents of the LP bridged an engaging stratum of traditional-to-contemporary Latin pop aesthetics [...].\" He elaborated further regarding its legacy on Lopez's overall musical career, \"[...] a decade-and-a-half's distance from its release, Como Ama una Mujer remains one of Lopez\u2019s most consistent records, fueled by the passion and determination initially glimpsed on This Is Me\u2026Then.

After military service, he returned to Memphis in 1964, and started a singing career with the small Genie label where he met Isaac Hayes and David Porter.  Soon, Stax founder Estelle Axton hired him to work at the record shop attached to the company's Satellite Studios, where he stayed for three years, also recording for the Minit label. His three consecutive releases, \"A Lot of Love\", \"60 Minutes of Your Love\" (both 1966), and \"Hooked  By  Love \" (1967), all found success in England, eventually becoming Northern Soul classics. \"A Lot of Love\" formed the musical basis of the Spencer Davis Group hit single \"Gimme Some Lovin'\" released in October 1966. In 1999, \"A Lot of Love\" was covered by the British band Simply Red and released as \"Ain't That a Lot of Love\".\nJim Stewart at Stax refused to give Banks a contract as a singer, but eventually Stax did give him a songwriting contract.  He began working with co-writer Allen Jones, placing songs with Johnnie Taylor and Sam and Dave, and also writing \"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\", later a UK hit for Elvis Costello.  Banks had greater success with the Staple Singers, writing their first Stax single \"Long Walk to DC\", and then some of their biggest hits including \"If You're Ready (Come Go with Me)\".In 1968, he formed a songwriting trio with Bettye Crutcher and Raymond Jackson, calling themselves We Three.  Their first song was \"Who's Making Love\", which was recorded by Johnnie Taylor and became a # 3 pop hit and # 1 R&B hit, Stax's biggest.  Banks also wrote, with Jackson and Carl Hampton, \"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\", a song first recorded by The Emotions which became a hit when recorded by Luther Ingram, and later recorded by Isaac Hayes and Millie Jackson and many other singers, including Barbara Mandrell, Rod Stewart and Cassandra Wilson.Banks' twin brother James also worked for Stax, co-writing the company's last big hit, Shirley Brown's \"Woman to Woman\".After Stax folded, Homer Banks and Carl Hampton signed a publishing deal with A&M Records and moved to California, where they continued to write but with less success. In 1977, as Banks and Hampton, they recorded the album Passport to Ecstasy for Warner Bros. Records. In the 1980s, Banks formed the Two's Company recording company with Lester Snell, which released albums by J. Blackfoot and Ann Hines. In 1983, Banks, Reginald Jenkins and Chuck Brooks formed Sound Town Records, Inc. and released the top twenty album on J. Blackfoot titled City Slicker. It included the R&B top five single \"Taxi\" and also debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, which he wrote and produced with Chuck Brooks. Banks and Brooks also produced the Intimate Storm album on the Sound Town Records label, which included four singles that made the Billboard R&B chart.

Just the whole long, drawn-out standstill behind it and how it kind of turned into a phoenix-rising type of deal, with people giving it mad love online and just became this underground type of sensation. So that's the real revenge, the music couldn't be shut down or hidden, but people got it and they loved it, just like I loved making it.

I casually read both of their whole catalogs, and they inspired me as a songwriter also, but there's a book Iceberg Slim wrote and the title is Airtight Willie & Me.

And I think even back then I thought it would be dope to have an album with the title Airtight-something, so Airtight's Revenge sounded like a black exploitation film.

In an interview with Parlour Magazine, Bilal elaborated on the message behind the album's cover art, stating:\n\nI'm killing them with the words. This album was my version of Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" and a retrospective look on the world and where we are today. There\u2019s not a lot of music like that these days.

As a scientist-musician he believed that musical tones, if properly employed, could influence the evolution of the brain.\"Joe Morris recalled: \"His music was much more about sound. He used to talk about the upper partials clashing together. It was very slow moving, it was much more about sounds slowly morphing into other sounds... It was... like what you would call electroacoustic improvisation now. His trio music, even though it had bass and drums, moved at a very slow pace. It had a sort of groove, but it was very different. And he operated differently. His rhetoric was very different. I don't think he ever thought of himself as a jazz musician; he just saw himself as a musician. He was a very dignified, incredibly brilliant guy. He would never lower himself to some mere label.\" Morris added: \"He was so brilliant in the way he spoke about things; it was impossible to dismiss it as just crazy talk. Even though at first it sounded like that, over time I understood what he was talking about, and we could have conversations. He used to say it was about evolution, that if we play things we haven't heard before, it will alter the biochemistry of the brain. He said that's what evolution is about...

The artist is driven to pursue and formulate successive objective forms. That is the only way to cross the river and stay alive in the current.

Sea Wolf signed to Dangerbird Records in 2007 and released the Get To The River Before It Runs Too Low EP and a full-length titled Leaves In The River.

The title was actually a reference to Camp X-Ray, the temporary detention facility located at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Some fans and critics expressed their disappointment at the album's length, stating that a playing time of 26 minutes was not sufficient for a full-length album and that they had expected more creative output from the band. By this time, however, the band's members had drifted heavily into other projects (most notably singer/guitarist John Reis, who was simultaneously playing in Hot Snakes and Sultans and running his record label Swami Records) and were not as creatively dedicated to Rocket as they had been in the past.

Just the whole long, drawn-out standstill behind it and how it kind of turned into a phoenix-rising type of deal, with people giving it mad love online and just became this underground type of sensation. So that's the real revenge, the music couldn't be shut down or hidden, but people got it and they loved it, just like I loved making it. That was the meaning behind 'revenge,' and 'Airtight' is just an old nickname that I got.\nBack in the day, I used to really be into reading Donald Goines and Iceberg Slim. I casually read both of their whole catalogs, and they inspired me as a songwriter also, but there's a book Iceberg Slim wrote and the title is Airtight Willie & Me. I kind of kept that name, 'Airtight.' And I think even back then I thought it would be dope to have an album with the title Airtight-something, so Airtight's Revenge sounded like a black exploitation film. It kind of fit the scenario.\nThe album's cover art is a reference to the iconic photo of Malcolm X peering through his window while holding a M1 carbine rifle. Instead of a rifle, Bilal is holding a microphone, and instead of peering through his bedroom curtain, Bilal is peering through a heavy red stage curtain. In an interview with Parlour Magazine, Bilal elaborated on the message behind the album's cover art, stating:\n\nI'm killing them with the words. This album was my version of Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" and a retrospective look on the world and where we are today. There\u2019s not a lot of music like that these days. It almost like some people today have the mental concept of if the world\u2019s going to blow up tomorrow, let\u2019s just get drunk, high and party and if shit blow up, we blow up\u2026  I made a record that was my retrospect on that mentality.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "264_693", "question": "What music label is Something Special represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27485", "text": "Various readings of what the situation in Words and Music might represent have emerged from critical studies of the work:\n\nVivian Mercier treats the three characters as separate beings, Croak being an \"old man who shuffles in\" asking Words and Music to be friends.\nEugene Webb suggests that \"Croak is the name the dialogue directions give to the conscious self of the artist\".\nCharles Lyons says that \"[i]n Words and Music Beckett provides three characters who seem to represent different psychic functions of a single consciousness \u2026 [however] Beckett does not integrate them into the image of a specific, whole person.\" Also a number of times Lyons hints at the autobiographical nature of the piece though without providing any real evidence. It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

Before Def was lowered to its final resting place, some of the 1,500+ mourners placed flowers and various musical and personal memorabilia in the open casket. Afterwards, mourners followed a 19th-century-style horse-drawn hearse and a six-piece brass band playing \"Amazing Grace\" to the after party\u2014named Ciao Def\u2014at a bowling alley. The new birth certificate was obtained and the company name changed to American Recordings.\nAmerican had several sub-labels over the years, including Onion Records, Ill Labels, Wild West, Whte Lbls, and Infinite Zero. The last was a partnership with Henry Rollins that specialized in reissues of obscure albums. None of these labels made the distribution transition after American Recordings left Warner Bros.

Although the album \u2013 Jones' fourth for MCA \u2013 did not break the top twenty on Billboards country albums chart, peaking at 23, it features the first recorded duet between the singer and his ex-wife Tammy Wynette since their 1981 LP Together Again.  The only single release from the album was \"A Good Year for the Roses\", a collaboration with Alan Jackson.  As Jones noted in his autobiography two years later, \"After the duets album was released, radio didn't know what to do with it...Alan was white-hot on the radio, and programmers wanted his voice.  But some didn't want his if they had to take mine.  The vast majority of Alan's other single records have gone to number one.  His duet with me was his first not to crack the top 50.\"  It actually peaked at number 57.  In June 1995, the song won the Music City News Country Awards \"Vocal Collaboration of the Year\".\nIn addition to a who's who of past and present country stars, the album boasted two significant contributors from outside the country music field.  The first was Mark Knopfler, primarily known as leader and guitarist for the rock band Dire Straits.  A big country fan who had recorded an album with Chet Atkins in 1990, Knopfler played guitar and sang background on a remake of Jones's first number one country hit from 1959, \"White Lightning\", and can be heard laughing as Jones hams it up on the vocal.  The other rock musician who sang with Jones was Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones on \"Say It's Not You\", which originally appeared on Jones's 1967 album If My Heart Had Windows.  In a 2004 interview that was posted on his website, Richards said of the meeting, \"That was a great experience...To sing with George \u2013 and get away with it! \u2013 was amazing.  What a possum.\"  In a 1996 Rolling Stone interview Jones confessed to Chuck Dean, \"I'll be honest with you: I love Keith Richards more than anything as a person.  He's a character \u2013 just fun to be around.\"  An hour-long documentary-style special was filmed in late 1994 to promote the duet album. It aired in 1995 on The Nashville Network.

Although overshadowed at the time of its release by the sudden popularity of Nevermind, the attention that album brought to the Seattle music scene helped Soundgarden get broader exposure, and Badmotorfinger peaked at number 39 on the Billboard 200 album chart on February 29, 1992. It was among the 100 top selling albums of 1992, sold a million copies in the early 1990s, and was certified platinum by the RIAA in January 1993.The album included the singles \"Jesus Christ Pose\", \"Outshined\", and \"Rusty Cage\", which gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations. The music videos for \"Outshined\" and \"Rusty Cage\" gained considerable airtime on MTV, but the video for \"Jesus Christ Pose\", the album's lead single, was removed from MTV's playlist amidst widespread controversy over the perceived anti-Christian message of the song and video. Promotion of the song also precipitated death threats against the band while they were on tour to support the album in the United Kingdom.In a contemporary review for Spin, Lauren Spencer hailed Badmotorfinger as a \"garden of sound\" that drew on older hard rock influences without sounding \"derivative\". Entertainment Weekly critic Gina Arnold commended Soundgarden for writing more engagingly than their contemporaries, \"who seldom get beyond extolling booze, girls, and cars\". She concluded in her review that the record was more \"stylishly bombastic rather than bludgeoningly bombastic. Tuneless heavy metal is, after all, still tuneless heavy metal, and in that department, Soundgarden are as functional as they make 'em.\" Writing for NME, Keith Cameron said that the band had found \"a cool balance\" between Cornell's \"bluesy screams\" and Thayil's \"brutish riff powerplay\" on Badmotorfinger, rendering the album more \"stripped down, lithe and lethal\" than Louder Than Love. Retrospectively, AllMusic staff-writer Steve Huey deemed Badmotorfinger \"heavy, challenging hard rock full of intellectual sensibility and complex band interplay\", while Ann Powers of Blender commented that \"Cornell strikes the perfect Jesus Christ pose on this sonic wallop\". Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, finding it \"credible\" as a metal record because of Thayil's impressive use of guitar noise, but less impressive lyrically, writing: \"Chris Cornell howls on about 'lookin for the paradigm' and 'your Jesus Christ pose' (I swear, that's the good stuff)\".At the 1992 Grammy Awards, Badmotorfinger received a nomination for Best Metal Performance. That same year, the album won a Northwest Area Music Award for Best Metal Album.It was ranked number 45 in the October 2006 issue of Guitar World on the magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time. Also, in April 2019, was ranked number 2 on Rolling Stone's \"50 Greatest Grunge Albums\" list.Buzz Osborne, whose band Melvins had a massive influence on grunge, called Badmotorfinger his favorite grunge album of all time, praising its sophistication and complex structures.

Most of the songs that would feature on Karma and Effect were written over the course of 2004 prior to entering the studio.During the writing and recording process, the band experienced multiple setbacks. Morgan initially wanted to title the album Catering to Cowards, but this was vetoed by Wind-up Records. In addition, Wind-up asked that the cover art be changed and Morgan was asked not to swear on any of the recordings. Morgan stated that the album was \"the culmination of a lot of anger and fear of the music industry and the people that happen to have power over our careers.\"\n\"Remedy\" was one of the first songs to be written in the studio. In a 2022 interview with American Songwriter, Morgan explained the song's origin: \"I was in Los Angeles, and I would go to the producer\u2019s house every day, and he had a studio in his garage. So he just handed me a guitar one day, and there was something about the guitar I just really loved playing, so I just started riffing and making stuff up. Then he said, 'Oh, that\u2019s great, let\u2019s run with that.' So we recorded the riff and he programmed drums to it, and then I came up with a verse, and we sort of built the song that way. I went back and we did the lyrics and vocals and that was the first single. [...] Wind-up was very adamant that we just go with the softer songs. [...] [W]hen 'Remedy' was chosen, there was a big fight, because the label didn't want us representing the heavier side of the band, so I was really happy we won that victory.\"In a 2013 Reddit AMA thread, Morgan stated that the lyrics to \"Truth\" were inspired by a \"brutal dysfunctional relationship.\" He further commented that, for the song's music video, director Dean Karr was the first to propose casting mixed martial artist Tito Ortiz in the role of Uncle Sam.\"The Gift\" was vaguely described by Morgan as \"a pretty personal song.\" It was allegedly nearly shelved after Callahan repeatedly objected to the song each time Morgan showed it to the band prior to recording for the album.The title for the track \"Burrito\" was inspired by watching The Osbournes. \"We didn't have a name for the song,\" Morgan recalled. \"Ozzy was running around mumbling about spicy burritos. And it was one of those moments where it was like, this is a legendary man, but it's a different side of him. It seemed real vulnerable and real personal. So we just picked it because it was a tongue-in-cheek homage to Ozzy Osbourne.\" The track was one of three songs written for the soundtrack to the 2003 film Daredevil, but was scrapped in favor of their song \"Hang On\" from Disclaimer II.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album received an average score of 78, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 30 reviews.In the review for AllMusic, writer Thom Jurek wrote that \"Once More 'Round the Sun furthers what Mastodon began on The Hunter: expanding their music past metal's rigid borders \u2013 toward an integrative sound that doesn't leave metal out.\" Michael Madden also praised the album in the review for Consequence of Sound, claiming that \"Mastodon are starting to look more like that band's peers [Slayer], not disciples. Nick Raskulinecz's eternally crunchy production helps them reach those heights on Once More 'Round the Sun, and, as Oakland artist Skinner's cover suggests, the record is vibrant, too. There could be more structural risk-taking and the band could stand to have more grandiose moments, but, well, you know: consider them six for six.\" Dom Lawson spoke highly of the album in his review for The Guardian, writing that \"Once More 'Round the Sun sounds very much like the album they need to make to edge a little further into the mainstream \u2013 it has a largely straightforward air and a tendency to favour the big hooks of 2011's The Hunter over the labyrinthine weirdness of 2009's Crack the Skye.\"Giving the album an eight out of ten for PopMatters, Dean Brown felt that \"when compared to the band's previous stratospheric evolutions, its substance may be just as important to the tale of Mastodon when the inevitable is written, hopefully decades into the future and many albums later from one of the best bands, regardless of genre, roaming the earth at present.\" Spin writer Johnathan Zwickel shared similar sentiments, claiming that \"While the rest of heavy music's luminaries follow in their wake, Mastodon's sound \u2013 and their ambition \u2013 is bigger than metal.\"Zoe Camp was more critical of the album in the review for Pitchfork, stating \"it's possible to view Once More 'Round the Sun as a vow to honor their roots, even as they set out in search of broader horizons.

I don't care who listens to our records. If it helps people in whatever circumstances they're in, that's amazing, but I definitely don't classify us as a Christian band.\" Elsewhere, Christian has remarked, \"[My faith] affects every single aspect of my life, but I'm not a preacher, I'm an entertainer.\"Despite these statements and others of the like, multiple sources list the band as part of the Christian rock genre, and some Anberlin song lyrics do contain Christian references.

Worrell was later replaced by various other bassists, including Reggie Workman, Finn Von Eyben, Harold Dodson, Eddie G\u00f3mez, Steve Swallow, and Buell Neidlinger. All About Jazz reviewer Clifford Allen wrote that the group \"cut some of the most powerful music in the free jazz underground\".In November 1962, Tchicai moved from his home country of Denmark to New York City at the suggestion of Archie Shepp and Bill Dixon, whom he had met at the Helsinki Jazz Festival earlier that year. Upon arriving in New York, Tchicai began playing with Dixon's group, which included Shepp and Roswell Rudd among others, and also sat in with Don Cherry and various other musicians. By the summer of 1963, Tchicai, Shepp, and Cherry had formed the New York Contemporary Five with bassist Don Moore and drummer J. C. Moses, while Rudd, with Shepp, continued to play with Dixon. According to Rudd, the idea of forming a new quartet originated with Tchicai, and the two began playing in filmmaker Michael Snow's loft space with Moore and Moses. Moses soon left as a result of mutual dissatisfaction with his role, and Rudd and Tchicai were soon introduced to drummer Milford Graves by saxophonist Giuseppi Logan. Tchicai recalled: \"this was a very pleasant surprise and more than that, because Graves simply baffled both Rudd and I in that we, at that time, hadn't heard anybody of the younger musicians in New York that had the same sense of rhythmic cohesion in poly-rhythmics or the same sense of intensity and musicality.\" Graves \"wound up playing with them for half an hour, astonishing Rudd and Tchicai, who promptly invited him to join what became The New York Art Quartet\". Graves later stated that his invitation to join the group came \"at a time when the evolutive phases of my spiritual and creative potential were in need of being expressed without limitation\". However, Tchicai also recalled that \"bassist Don Moore became so frightened of this wizard of a percussionist that he decided that this couldn't be true or possible and, therefore, refused to play with us\", and the group brought in bassist Lewis Worrell in his place.In July 1964, Tchicai and Rudd briefly joined Albert Ayler's quartet, which consisted of Ayler, Cherry, Gary Peacock, and Sunny Murray, to record New York Eye and Ear Control, the soundtrack for a film by Michael Snow. That fall, the NYAQ, calling themselves \"The John Tchicai Quartet\", played their debut concert, participating in the \"October Revolution in Jazz\" organized by Bill Dixon. In November, the NYAQ recorded their first album as part of ESP Disk's original roster of jazz artists, and a month later they performed at the Dixon-organized festival \"Four Days in December\" as the \"Roswell Rudd - John Tchicai Quartet\", playing opposite Sun Ra at Judson Hall. The group's second album, Mohawk, was recorded in July 1965 with Reggie Workman on bass (Worrell left the group in December 1964), and was released on the Fontana label. In the fall of 1965, Tchicai lined up dates for the NYAQ in Copenhagen, Gothenburg (Sweden), Hilversum (Holland), and Amsterdam (where they opened for Ornette Coleman's group), with Finn Von Eyben playing bass and Louis Moholo playing drums as a result of scheduling issues with the original musicians. Recordings from this tour were issued on Roswell Rudd, released in 1971 without Rudd's consent, and in 2010 on the album Old Stuff. The group broke up in February 1966, with Tchicai returning to Denmark.On June 13, 1999, the NYAQ, with Workman on bass, reunited for a performance at the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, opening for Sonic Youth. Amiri Baraka, whose poem \"Black Dada Nihilismus\" was included on their debut album 35 years earlier, also appeared. The group recorded the album 35th Reunion  the following day.

In 2013, after Tchicai's death, Triple Point Records released a limited-edition five-LP box set, along with a 156-page coffee-table book and miscellaneous artifacts, entitled Call It Art.According to Tchicai, one of the most unique aspects of the NYAQ was \"the polyphonic part of the music that came into play; the whole collective style of playing that also existed in New Orleans Jazz and classical music. The polyphonic aspect of our music was something quite new compared to what other people were doing in contemporary jazz.\" David Toop described the group's signature sound as \"deliberately ragged, bleary themes tumbling out in spasms, notes tailing away as if lost to daydream, the music so open that total collapse seems perpetually imminent\". In his liner notes to Mohawk, Tchicai wrote: \"The important thing about our music is that it must be heard and listened to without preconceived ideas as to how jazz should sound \u2013 listen to it as MUSIC and let that be the only label!\"A documentary on the NYAQ, entitled The Breath Courses Through Us, was released in 2013 by director Alan Roth.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by Virgin Records (EMI France). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist Kelly Rowland, who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by Nervo.\nAccording to Rowland, the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album Here I Am (2011), while Guetta noted \"When Love Takes Over\" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds. Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track. Veronica Ferraro mixed the song, focusing primarily on giving Rowland's vocals a magical and inspiring tone. Critics would later state that Rowland's vocals on \"When Love Takes Over\" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist. The song's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other, while the production bears some similarities to Coldplay's 2002 hit single \"Clocks\".\n\"When Love Takes Over\" received universal acclaim. Most noted the addition of Rowland's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from One Love. The song was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries, including in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland. At the time of release, it became Guetta's highest-charting single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Rowland's second number one single in the United Kingdom. \"When Love Takes Over\" ranked at number one on Billboard's Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart. In 2013, Billboard named \"When Love Takes Over\" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time, in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging electronic dance music trend in America at its time of release.\nIn the song's accompanying music video, Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together. It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result. \"When Love Takes Over\" was promoted mainly at award shows, including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards, NRJ Music Awards and the World Music Awards. Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \"When Love Takes Over\" for the annual Miss Universe competition. The single earned several Platinum and Gold certifications, selling over 5.5 million copies worldwide. Additionally, it earned Guetta two Grammy Award nominations for \"Best Dance Recording\" and \"Best Non-Classical, Remixed Recording\", the latter of which Guetta won for his \"Electro Extended Mix\" of \"When Love Takes Over\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

That month, while Houston was on her first headlining world tour, The Greatest Love World Tour, Arista head Clive Davis began preparing songs for Houston's sophomore release. Following the global crossover success of \"How Will I Know\" produced by Narada Michael Walden, Davis handpicked him to be the primary producer of the second album. During the summer, Houston began recording with Walden with material Davis had previewed for the singer in demo recordings, including \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\". Though Davis wanted Houston to have a younger, accessible sound, Davis agreed to continue the previous album's use of ballads.\nComposer and lyricist Frank Wildhorn, who later conceived the Broadway musical, Jekyll & Hyde, had wanted to write a song for Houston after hearing her duet with Teddy Pendergrass, \"Hold Me\", a couple of years earlier. He and songwriter Chuck Jackson were eventually hired by Davis to compose a ballad for the singer. According to Wildhorn, Jackson, known for writing hit songs such as \"This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)\" and \"I've Got Love on My Mind\" for Natalie Cole, called him on the phone and gave him the title. From there, he said, he \"sat there at the piano... and in about 40 minutes, 90% of the sketch of the song was done\". Afterwards, he called Jackson back and told him to come over his house because \"I think we've got something\" and the duo finished the song later that night.\nAfter presenting the song to Davis, Wildhorn recalled the song's selection for the album:\"From what I understand, it was one of the first songs chosen for the album. Knowing [it was for] Whitney's project, there must have been 50,000 songs submitted after (ours). So every week it was, 'Do we still have it?' We were going through hell.\"\nAlong with \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" and \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\", it was one of the earliest songs presented for Houston's sophomore effort. Prior to her recording the song, other singers, such as Smokey Robinson, offered to record it but Wildhorn and Jackson refused, holding out hope for Houston to record it.When Houston eventually listened to a demo record of the ballad, the singer flatly turned it down, thinking the song \"had no depth to it\". Years later, in a 2000 interview, Houston admitted, \"I didn't even wanna do '[Where Do] Broken Hearts [Go]', I hated the song, I didn't wanna sing it\". However, Davis insisted the song would be perfect for Houston to sing because, he told her, \"this is your number one song\". Houston said she eventually found \"some meaning in [the song] that I could relate to\" when she entered the studio with Walden producing the session.Once Houston started recording, Wildhorn recalls being struck by her performance:\n\n\u201cI cried the first time I heard Whitney sing \u2018Where Do Broken Hearts Go.\u2019 I've had Julie Andrews, Liza Minnelli, Johnny Mathis, Trisha Yearwood and Patti LaBelle (sing songs I've written), but if someone put a gun to my head, the answer is Whitney's version of \u2018Where do Broken Hearts go,\u2019 going No. 1, that's as good as it gets.\u201d", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although neither band released any albums, Wolfgang, who are still active, recorded an undisclosed number of songs that, according to Joensen, are \"pretty much ready to release\".T\u00fdr formed in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1998. Heri Joensen met his old bandmate, K\u00e1ri Streymoy, at a party in January in Copenhagen. Joensen suggested to Streymoy that they should meet up and jam. Streymoy initially declined, but later took him up on his offer. They were soon joined by another former bandmate, bassist Gunnar H. Thomsen, expanding the duo into a trio. In 2001, guitarist Terji Skiben\u00e6s joined the band.\nThey signed a worldwide deal with Austria's Napalm Records in early 2006, while signed to the Faroese record label Tutl. In September 2012, they signed a three-album deal with Metal Blade Records.They began making music which was heavily inspired by Norse mythology, kv\u00e6\u00f0i (Faroese traditional music), and heavy metal music in general. According to the band's frontman Heri Joensen:\n\"T\u00fdr's musical mission is to break down the walls that are erected between all the kinds of metal that have arisen over the years. Power, doom, black, progressive, gothic, viking, folk, ethnic and epic metal. Walls and labels do nothing but fill people with prejudice.\"\nAccordingly, scholarship has found that the band's lyrics and imagery promote pan-Nordic ideologies, and draw on well established, transnational genre conventions from metal music; but has also suggested that the band's insistence on their Faroese identity, which has been fetishised by international audiences, could be \"regarded as a form of self-exoticisation\". The band's handling of traditional songs is characterised by fidelity to traditional melodies, but more complex and innovative handling of associated chord progressions and harmonies.The band has been accused of promoting Nazi ideologies through their use of runes and other imagery appropriated by Nazis. The band responded to these accusations with the song \"Shadow of the Swastika\" on the album Lay of Thrym (2011), which in the assessment of Karl Spracklen, \"attacks the far-right for appropriating...heathen symbols and images associated with pre-Christian northern Europe\". Even so, scholars have, in the words of Catherine Hoad and Samuel Whiting, suggested that \"through imagining the Viking as an ancestral, genetic category, the 'common past' of the Nordic people is constructed as a self-identity apart from other people\" in the work of T\u00fdr. Likewise, Spracklen finds that \"the themes in T\u00fdr's songs celebrate pagan identity, Viking identity and the hegemonic masculinity of the Viking warrior combined with the modern-day heavy metal anthem of being an individual\".The band released the song \"Rainbow Warrior\", a song about the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in response to their campaign against whaling in the Faroe Islands.

Rod Stewart was among the dozens of aspiring vocalists that were considered for the auditions, but was not up to the standards the band required. They chose Rod Evans instead, who was already the singer of the club band The Maze. Evans brought along after the audition his 19-year-old bandmate Ian Paice, a drummer whom Blackmore recognised from his days in Hamburg. They quickly improvised an audition for Paice and he was chosen on the spot to replace Woodman behind the drum kit. Woodman was unhappy with the direction the band was heading and the other members thought that he was not suited for their sound.The first rehearsals of what would be known as the Mk. I line-up of Deep Purple involved mostly jamming and some work on the instrumentals \"And the Address\" and \"Mandrake Root\", which Blackmore and Lord had written earlier that year. Mandrake Root was also the name of an earlier band that Blackmore had been trying to form in Germany, before being contacted by Roundabout's management. After the two instrumentals, the first proper song to be arranged was \"Help!\", a Beatles cover that Chris Curtis wanted to include in an eventual album. Evans wrote some lyrics for \"Mandrake Root\" and reduced to one the number of instrumental tracks. Having arranged and rehearsed the first three songs, the musicians focused their attention on \"I'm So Glad\", a song by Skip James which had earlier been covered by Cream and The Maze. The next addition during rehearsals was \"Hey Joe\", a song originally, but disputably, written by Billy Roberts and mistakenly credited to Deep Purple on original releases of the album. The main inspiration for the new arrangement of the song was the 1966 hit version by American guitarist Jimi Hendrix, but the track length was stretched with the inclusion of classical-influenced instrumental sections. The band also selected a pop rock song called \"Hush\", written by Joe South for Billy Joe Royal the previous year, which Blackmore had heard while in Germany.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

The reverse shows a goddess seated on a lion, with the legend \"Li-ccha-va-yah\" (\ud804\udc4a, \"the Lichchhavis\").Various scholars, including numismatist John Allan, have considered that the gold coins bearing the portraits of Chandragupta and Kumaradevi were issued by Samudragupta to commemorate his parents, while others have attributed the issue of these coins to Chandragupta himself, or even suggested that these coins were issued by the Lichchhavis.V. S. Pathak theorized that the coins show the royal couple in the vaivahika (nuptial) pose, but there is no concrete evidence that the coins depict the royal wedding. S.V. Sohoni theorized that the coins depicted Chandragupta taking leave of Kumaradevi while going on a military campaign, but this is doubtful given the lack of a phrase indicative of military prowess (unlike the coins of their son Samudragupta). The coins probably simply depict Chandragupta and Kumaradevi as joint rulers.The identity of the female figure appearing on the reverse of these coins is uncertain. It is unlikely that she was a Gupta queen, as the depiction of a female figure seated on a lion is characteristic of a goddess in historical art of India. Some historians, such as A. S. Altekar, have identified the goddess as Durga. However, although Durga is often represented as seated on a lion, this attribute is not unique to her: Lakshmi has also been depicted as seated on a lion. For example, Hemadri's works mention Simha-vahini (\"having lion as her vahana\") Lakshmi, and images from Khajuraho depict Simha-vahini Gajalakshmi. Some scholars, such as John Allan, have identified the goddess on the coins as Lakshmi, who is the goddess of fortune and the wife of Vishnu. She may have been featured on the coins as a symbol of the Guptas' royal prosperity, or as a mark of their Vaishnavite affiliation, but this cannot be said with certainty.

Once again, the songs are sung largely in Swedish by Gustav Ejstes. \"These songs are my everyday experiences, my thoughts and stories from the life I live,\" he said in a statement. \"I hope people can create their own stories around the music and maybe we can make music together, the listener and I.\" The album was an international success, placing at no.14 on Australian publication Happy Mag's list of \"The 25 best psychedelic rock albums of the 2010s\" in October 2019.Around 2014, the group undertook a project to create an instrumental score for the 1926 animated film The Adventures of Prince Achmed to be performed live with the film. They did so on several occasions in Sweden in 2014 and at the first Marfa Myths Festival in Marfa, Texas, United States. Inspired by what they created, the passed recordings to their producer Mattias Glav\u00e5 with instructions to 'make it into a record'.  The album was released on 25 November 2016 as an official Black Friday Record Store Day release and then re-released in a limited edition by Mexican Summer with a bonus 12\" live EP recorded in Sol de Sants Studios after their show at Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona.

I (Matthew Ellis) stopped playing music and went off to college, but the guy who I was always playing guitar with (Kyle Cooke) called me up and said he had terminal cancer. He said I should move home so we could start a new band. I suddenly felt like I would much rather be playing music, and that's what I was supposed to do.  So, I moved back home and we started A Hope for Home.\nAfter a long struggle with cancer, founding member Kyle Cooke died on August 5, 2006. After his death, friends and family members of Cooke created the \"Kyle Cooke Foundation\", a \"non-profit fundraising corporation that raises money for The Friends of Doernbecher Foundation and the people of the Camas and Washougal community on a need by need basis\".\nOn their website is a post stating the following:\n\nOur message is simple, Believe in Hope. No matter what you are going through in your life, there is always hope. Kyle battled cancer for 6 years of his life, and lived far longer than he was ever expected. He never stopped fighting, and didn't give into hopelessness. He lived a full life through it all, and used the pain and hardships that he was going through for a much higher purpose. Hopelessness can easily take over when we are in overwhelming circumstances and it takes real strength to overcome it. Kyle found hope through his faith in God and through the love from the people in his life. When it comes down to it, those are the things that can keep you going, no matter what life throws your way. So the best way you can support our message, is be somebody's hope, help them through whatever they are going through, just like Kyle did. Thank you. Much love & God bless, The Kyle Cooke Foundation.\n\nA Hope for Home has since continued with new members, while still bearing the name created by Kyle Cooke as a remembrance of their formation. In 2007, A Hope for Home entered the home studio of bassist Dan McCall (Robots Ate My Studio) and recorded their first album Here, the End. The track \"Kyle\" off of the album was written for Kyle Cooke by Matthew Ellis, and in the liner notes of the album there are words stating that the entire album is dedicated to the memory of Kyle Cooke. After releasing Here, the End in 2007, A Hope for Home gained local praise and began building their fan base by playing routinely at local venues such as The Noisebox in Camas, Wa and the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, OR.After several months of touring for Here, the End, A Hope for Home re-entered the studio to begin recording their next album.On December 4, 2008 the band announced via their Purevolume page that they had signed to Strike First Records (the imprint label for Facedown Records). \"After 2 years of being a 100% DIY group we have finally been given an awesome chance to take the next step in the industry, and we can't be more excited\".\n\nThe Everlasting Man was released on January 20, 2009 on Strike First Records. The title of the album is taken from the G. K. Chesterton nonfiction work of the same name. The Everlasting Man added more atmospheric textures to their sound, using many different guitar effects and tones woven together with electronic backgrounds while still holding a strong drum and bass foundation. In an interview with Indie Vision Music, Keyboardist Eric Gerrard explained that \"We wanted to sing about and affirm value in things that aren't often talked about in the current scene today\" and that \"a lot of our ideas lined up with what Chesterton talks about in the book (The Everlasting Man)\".\n\nIn September 2009 after several months of touring A Hope for Home announced that drummer Ian Vidovic would be leaving the band to pursue his other musical projects \"Roads\" and international touring with \"The New Divide\".After the departure of Vidovic, A Hope for Home entered a practice space in Beaverton, Oregon (recruiting the help of fellow drummer Lance Taylor) and began writing Realis, their third album to date. Throughout January 2010 A Hope for Home recorded at the \"Red Room Studios\" in Seattle, Washington and \"Robots Ate My Studio\" in Camas, WA. The album was produced by bassist Dan McCall, mastered by Troy Glessner at \"Spectre Mastering\", and featured art direction and design by guitarist Tanner Morita. Realis, a concept album about the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, was a drastic change in the band's musical style. Far from the \"breakdowns\", \"dance parts\", and \"double bass\" of their previous records, Realis brought song structures and instrumentation that clearly indicated their Post and Sludge metal influences (Envy, Cult Of Luna, Isis). The album was well received by many music review sites (Absolute Punk, The New Review, Indie Vision Music).On September 10, 2011 the band announced via their Facebook page that they had finished their fourth official album titled \"In Abstraction\", and that it is set to be released on December 6, 2011 on Facedown Records. On November 25, 2011 the band played a cd release show for In Abstraction at the local Portland, OR Rotture-Branx venue complex along with local artists Tribes, Tiny Dads, Amos Val, My Mantle, and Kye Kye.In January of 2022, the band announced via their Twitter account that they had entered the studio to record their first album in over 10 years, set to be released in 2022.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He then made the cross-county transition to Broadway, appearing in Kid Boots (1923), the Ziegfeld Follies of 1924, Ziegfeld Follies of 1925, and Good News (1927).George Olsen and his orchestra were in Eddie Cantor's 1928 Broadway hit Whoopee!, and in the 1930 movie version. In the Follies George met a singer, Ethel Shutta, who sings and dances memorably in Whoopee!, and they married, appearing together in nightclubs and on radio. They had two children, George Jr. and Charles; following a divorce, Olsen opened a restaurant in Paramus, New Jersey. Olsen and Shutta were heard on the Oldsmobile Program on CBS radio in 1933. He also was an orchestra leader for The Jack Benny Program on radio.\nOlsen signed with Victor in 1924 and remained as one of Victor's most popular bands until 1933 when he signed with Columbia.

Initially self-labeled as Bollywood Punk, the band adopted the label \"Taqwacore\", in reference to a book called The Taqwacores by American novelist Michael Muhammad Knight, which imagines what a would-be American Muslim Punk scene would look like. This connection quickly fascinated American and International Media, which led to much being written about this unique example of life-imitating-art, and many international tours with the author. Many fans of this phenomenon felt that this was a necessary complicating counter-narrative to a simplistic and largely Islamophobic post-9/11 American media landscape.\nThey came to renown in South Asia from songs they released in Punjabi, Urdu, and Hindi. Their filmed BBC session where the band covered Bollywood classic \"Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai\" especially got the band much positive attention from the Southern Asian and Punjabi peoples, both native and abroad.\nOne of their biggest hits is the song \"Tunnnnnn\", which is a re-interpretation of a classic reggae song; Willie Williams' \"Armagideon Time\". The lyrics of \"Tunnnnnn\" are a mashup of English, Urdu, and Punjabi. Its lyrics proclaim (in Urdu): \"We will only drink what they drink in Iraq! We will only drink what they drink in Karbala!\", touching upon the subject of the horrific reality of warfare and the bombs which were dropped on those places. \"Tunnnnnn\" was an instant hit with both Kominas fans and newcomers alike.\nWith the self-titled release \"Kominas\" in 2012, the band has adopted the more Americana rock elements grunge and garage rock in their style and moved away from writing about Muslim-centric issues.  From 2009\u20132012 the band toured extensively around America, Canada, and Europe.

While in September 2008, Kilbey discussed the track with Iain Shedden of The Australian.Willson-Piper said, \"'Milky Way' is perfect really, in the way that it crosses over from our past records.

However, Stephen Christian stated in an interview that their faith is more complicated than a simple label: \"I think we're categorized like that a lot because we're on Tooth & Nail Records, which, years ago, was known as a Christian label and never lost that reputation. I don't care who listens to our records. If it helps people in whatever circumstances they're in, that's amazing, but I definitely don't classify us as a Christian band.\" Elsewhere, Christian has remarked, \"[My faith] affects every single aspect of my life, but I'm not a preacher, I'm an entertainer.\"Despite these statements and others of the like, multiple sources list the band as part of the Christian rock genre, and some Anberlin song lyrics do contain Christian references. Furthermore, the band appears at Christian music festivals such as Parachute Music Festival and Cornerstone Festival, and their songs have been included on Christian rock compilation CDs and DVDs.  They are also played on the Gospel Music Channel.Anberlin has also been repeatedly featured in Christian rock magazine HM (Hard Music, which was originally the fanzine Heaven's Metal). Christian submitted a letter to the magazine, criticizing the more overtly religious Christian punk band the Knights of the New Crusade for a promotional image that represented a \"black mark on the face of Christianity\".Christian has also said in an interview with Lightforce radio how the band tries to \"step out of the bubble\" and referred to themselves as being part of Christian music. He discussed in detail what Christians should do in their lives: love and embrace others as Jesus would as well as show God's grace to others. He mentioned as well how the band Fall Out Boy said in an interview that they did not really know much about Jesus until Anberlin toured with them.In an interview with Smartpunk, drummer Nathan Young commented, \"The thing is, some bands that are trying to get out of the Christian market, they get bummed out by questions about it. I don\u2019t really mind it, because I\u2019m a Christian, and I\u2019m okay talking about it. With the whole term 'Christian Band,' I don\u2019t understand how a band can be Christian.

After Murder Park received critical acclaim but was not as commercially successful as its predecessors. For around a year, singer Sarah Nixey had been working as a backing vocalist in the band Balloon to harmonize with frontman Ian Bickerton. Bickerton, who wanted more musicians to help the band in a recording studio, recruited Haines and former the Jesus and Mary Chain member John Moore. In 1996, Haines released a self-titled album under the moniker Baader Meinhof, which Moore enjoyed. Haines had tired of listening to his voice and decided to form Black Box Recorder with Moore in March 1997. Moore coined the band's name while flying home from Spain. Moore persuaded Volume magazine to include a Black Box Recorder track on their next compilation album, prompting Haines to visit Moore at his residence in Little Venice, London, to make noise.With fruitless results, the Moore and Haines began creating a song with the idea of having Nixey sing; by this point, Haines had written \"Girl Singing in the Wreckage\" while Moore had written \"England Made Me\". The pair habitually wrote material without exerting much effort to create simple compositions. Nixey, who had been helping Moore with his own songs, received a fax promising to make her famous if she sang on \"Girl Singing in the Wreckage\". She had been aware of the Auteurs through friends, and owned a copy of the Jesus and Mary Chain album Psychocandy (1985) but did not know the pair personally. Nixey was unsure about fronting Black Box Recorder but Moore encouraged her by saying he liked her voice. Nixey initially agreed to sing on one track that was due to be released on the Volume compilation.

He began formal piano studies at the age of nine and was soon playing for his church choir. His father had brought an alto saxophone home from the service and when Hank entered Manassas High School, he took it up in order to join the band. He credits Charlie Parker, Louis Jordan, Earl Bostic and Johnny Hodges as early influences.\nCrawford appears on an early 1952 Memphis recording for B.B. King, with a band including Ben Branch and Ike Turner.In 1958, Crawford went to college at Tennessee State University in Nashville, Tennessee. While at TSU, he majored in music studying theory and composition, as well as playing alto and baritone saxophone in the Tennessee State Jazz Collegians. He also led his own rock 'n' roll quartet, \"Little Hank and the Rhythm Kings\". His bandmates all thought he looked and sounded just like Hank O'Day, a local saxophonist, which earned him the nickname \"Hank\". This is when Crawford met Ray Charles, who hired Crawford originally as a baritone saxophonist. Crawford switched to alto in 1959, and remained with Charles' band \u2014 becoming its musical director until 1963.When Crawford left Ray Charles in 1963 to form his own septet, he had already established himself with several albums for Atlantic Records. From 1960 until 1970, he recorded twelve LPs for the label, many while balancing his earlier duties as Ray's director. He released such pre-crossover hits as \"Misty\", \"The Peeper\", \"Whispering Grass\", and \"Shake-A-Plenty\".\nHe also has done musical arrangement for Etta James, Lou Rawls, and others. Much of his career has been in R&B, but in the 1970s he had several successful jazz albums, with I Hear a Symphony reaching 11 on Billboard's Jazz albums list and 159 for Pop albums.\nDavid Sanborn cites Crawford as being one of his primary influences. Crawford is recognized by saxophonists as having a particularly unique and pleasing sound. In 1981, he featured, with fellow horn players Ronnie Cuber and David Newman, on B.B. King's There Must Be a Better World Somewhere.\nIn 1983 he moved to Milestone Records as a premier arranger, soloist, and composer, writing for small bands including guitarist Melvin Sparks, organist Jimmy McGriff, and Dr. John. In 1986, Crawford began working with blues-jazz organ master Jimmy McGriff. They recorded five co-leader dates for Milestone Records: Soul Survivors, Steppin' Up, On the Blue Side, Road Tested, and Crunch Time, as well as two dates for Telarc Records: Right Turn on Blue and Blues Groove. The two toured together extensively.\nThe new century found Crawford shifting gears and going for a more mainstream jazz set in his 2000 release The World of Hank Crawford. Though the songs are compositions from jazz masters such as Duke Ellington and Tadd Dameron, he delivers in that sanctified church sound that is his trademark. Followed by The Best of Hank Crawford and Jimmy McGriff (2001).\nCrawford died on January 29, 2009, at his home in Memphis, aged 74, due to complications arising from an earlier stroke.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She moved to Nashville one week before her 21st birthday, where she now resides, and worked as a background singer for a number of artists, including Bill Gaither and Amy Grant.Plumb was originally formed in 1997 as a five-piece band that consisted of Arbuckle on vocals, Joe Porter on drums, Matt Stanfield on keyboards, J.J. Plasencio on bass guitar and Stephen Leiweke on guitar, with name, Plumb, coming from the Suzanne Vega song \"My Favorite Plum\". Following Silvertone Records affiliate Essential Records mainstream alternative radio success with its debut artist Jars of Clay in 1995, the label signed Plumb as its second artist. When Arbuckle was urged to write, she turned to Matt Bronleewe\u2014an original member of Jars of Clay who happened to be her next-door neighbor\u2014and the two hit it off. The debut album, Plumb, was released in 1997. Plumb has said subsequently that the addition of the letter \"B\" to the end was the idea of her producer Matt Bronleewe and, in her mind, also represents Bronleewe's important contribution to her sound.In 1999, Plumb released a second studio album, Candycoatedwaterdrops, which won the 2000 Gospel Music Association Dove Award for \"Modern Rock Album of the Year\". Three tracks from it were later covered by other artists; \"Stranded\" and \"Here with Me\" by Jennifer Paige and, in 2001, \"Damaged\" by Plummet. Though the album won the DOVE Award for Best Modern Rock Album in 2000, and saw strong radio success with the single \"God-Shaped Hole\", the subject matter and approach of much of Plumb's music was often considered too dark and taboo for the mainstream Christian marketplace. Plumb's tendency to write songs about deeply personal issues, such as international hit \"Cut\" which addressed cutting, and \"Damaged\" which addressed a girl coping with being molested as a child, led to more enthusiastic reception by fans of alternative and dance music. Fueling the break from contemporary Christian music, \"Cut\" was also used prominently during a pivotal scene in the storyline of The Vampire Diaries in the 10th episode of season 1, \"The Turning Point\". Later in 1999, all band members left the band, and since that time Plumb became a solo project of Tiffany Arbuckle.\nPlumb considered leaving the music industry after the 2000 album, but changed her mind after receiving a note from a fan a few hours before what she thought to be her final concert. The letter was about her song \"Damaged\" about a girl coping with being molested as a child. The note said \"Whatever you do, I just want you to never forget that you have changed someone's life,\" which inspired Plumb to remain in the music industry. She signed to Curb Records in 2003, releasing the album Beautiful Lumps of Coal on March 25, 2003. The lead single, \"Real\", peaked at No. 41 on the UK Singles Chart. Her next album, Chaotic Resolve, entered the Billboard 200 album chart at No. 177 on March 9, 2006. \"Better\" reached No. 1 on the U.S. Christian airplay chart. The Bronleewe & Bose remix of her follow-up \"Cut\", hit No. 1 on SiriusXM's dance hits channel BPM, and No. 5 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart.Shortly after the birth of her second child, Plumb recorded her fifth album, Blink, as a collection of lullaby inspired songs. It was released on October 9, 2007, immediately becoming one of her best selling and most enduring albums to date. Lead single \"In My Arms\" was used in conjunction with key plot narratives for both Vampire Diaries and One Tree Hill, and became Plumb's biggest international hit to date, selling close to half a million singles in both the United States and Russia. \"In My Arms\" received remixes by Kaskade, Scotty K, Bronleewe & Bose, Gomi, and Bimbo Jones, with the latter reaching the No. 3 spot on the Billboard Dance chart.On May 19, 2009, Curb Records announced that it would release a career-spanning greatest hits album, Beautiful History, which was released later in the year and included several new songs. The first single from Beautiful History, \"Hang On\", reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2009 and reached the top spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in 2010.\nPlumb returned to the studio in 2010 with longtime producer and co-writer Matt Bronleewe to begin work on what would become her 6th studio album, while also changing management and signing with alternative boutique firm Street Talk Media. The debut single from the project, \"Drifting\", a co-penned duet with longtime friend Dan Haseltine (of Jars of Clay), spread quickly across Christian rock radio. The second single, \"Need You Now (How Many Times)\", went to contemporary Christian music radio in early 2012 and has become Plumb's most successful single to date in that market, rising to number to No. 1 on multiple radio and iTunes charts in both the United States and Canada by year's end. The single has remained in regular rotation nationwide for well over a year, selling close to 300,000 singles on iTunes to date, and is BDS certified at over 100,000 radio spins. The album Need You Now was released worldwide in February 2013, charting at a career-best No. 56 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 2 on Christian album charts. The album received five Dove Award nominations including Song of the Year and Contemporary/Pop Album of the Year. With her children now all at least grade school age, and with the massive success of Need You Now, 2012 and 2013 saw the most aggressive touring of her entire career, playing major festivals throughout 2012 and 2013, embarking on her first and largely sold-out headlining tour in the fall of 2013, and joining the massive Winterjam arena tour for November 2013-14.Plumb released her seventh studio album, Exhale, on May 4, 2015.Plumb left Curb Records in early 2017 to form her own label, Plumb Music, and released her first single \"God Help Me\" in July 2017.

He attended Public School 44, where he was the 50-yard dash champion. While in high school, Billy studied shorthand under John Robert Gregg, the inventor of the Gregg System for shorthand notation. He won a dictation contest using Gregg notation, taking over 150 words per minute, and writing forward or backward with either hand.Billy Rose began his career as a stenographic clerk to Bernard Baruch of the War Industries Board during World War I, and became head of the clerical staff. Later he became a lyricist. In this role, he is best known as the credited writer or co-writer of the lyrics to \"Me and My Shadow,\" \"Great Day\" (with Edward Eliscu), \"Does the Spearmint Lose Its Flavor on the Bedpost Overnight\" (with Marty Bloom), \"I Found a Million Dollar Baby\" (with Mort Dixon) and \"It's Only a Paper Moon\" (with E. Y. Harburg).\nMost of Rose's lyrical credits were collaborations. Biographer Earl Conrad said, \"Nobody clearly knew what he wrote or didn't write.... Publishers tend to credit him with writing the songs known to bear his name as a lyricist.... But tales rumble on ... that Billy could feed and toss in a remark and monkey around, but that others did most of the writing.\" Lyricists might have been willing to tolerate a Rose credit grab because Rose was very successful at promoting \"his\" songs.\nHe went on to become a Broadway producer, and a theatre/nightclub owner. In June 1934, he opened The Billy Rose Music Hall at 52nd and Broadway in New York with the first Benny Goodman Orchestra. He produced Jumbo, starring Jimmy Durante, at the New York Hippodrome Theatre. For the Fort Worth Frontier Centennial (1936\u201337), he constructed the huge elaborate dinner theatre Casa Ma\u00f1ana which featured celebrated fan-dancer Sally Rand and the world's largest revolving stage. He produced the Aquacade at the Great Lakes Exposition in Cleveland, Ohio in 1937.Rose was diminutive in stature. When he attended a show, his practice was to book four seats: one for himself, one for his date, and the two in front of those so he would have an unobstructed view.\nIn 1929, he married Fanny Brice, who went on to star in the 1931 Broadway production of Billy Rose's Crazy Quilt. The marriage ended in divorce in 1938.\nIn 1938, he opened Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe, a nightclub in New York City's Times Square in the basement of the Paramount Hotel. It initially opened with a version of his Fort Worth show. The Diamond Horseshoe operated under that name until 1951.\nAt the 1939 New York World's Fair, Billy Rose's Aquacade starred Olympian Eleanor Holm in what the fair program called \"a brilliant girl show of spectacular size and content.\" Future MGM star Esther Williams and Tarzan star Johnny Weissmuller were both Aquacade headliners. Rose began an affair with the then-married Holm, who left her husband for Rose. The couple married in 1939.\nFollowing the 1939 World's Fair, Rose asked John Murray Anderson, who had staged the Aquacade, to recommend a choreographer for a new show at the Horseshoe. Anderson recommended Gene Kelly, then performing in William Saroyan's One for the Money. Rose objected that he wanted someone who could choreograph \"tits and asses,\" not \"soft-soap from a crazy Armenian\" (Yudkoff, 2001). However, after seeing Kelly's performance, he gave Kelly the job, an important step in Kelly's career.\nIn 1943, he produced Carmen Jones with an all-black cast. An adaptation of Georges Bizet's opera Carmen, the story was transplanted to World War II America by lyricist and librettist Oscar Hammerstein II. It was an instant hit. The New York Telegraph called it \"far and away the best show in New York\"; The New York Times said it was \"beautifully done ... just call it wonderful.\" The New York Herald Tribune said that Oscar Hammerstein II \"must be considered one of the greatest librettists of our day\" and that Carmen Jones was \"a masterly tour de force.\" It was made into a motion picture in 1954, for which Dorothy Dandridge received an Oscar nomination.\nIn 1946, Rose's memoir Wine, Women and Words, dedicated to Rose's early patron Bernard M. Baruch, was published in New York by Simon & Schuster. The book was illustrated, including the cover of the numbered and signed first edition of 1500 copies, by Salvador Dal\u00ed whom Rose met while producing events at the 1939 World's Fair.\nFollowing the publication of Wine, Women and Words Rose appeared on the cover of Time on June 2, 1947.\nIn 1946, he began publishing a series of ads for the Diamond Horseshoe in the New York Daily News. This led to a syndicated column, Pitching Horseshoes, that Rose produced until December, 1950. At its height, it reached 2,000 newspapers.Rose and Holm divorced in 1954. On July 2, 1956, he married showgirl Joyce Mathews (1919-1999), and they divorced July 23, 1959. They then remarried on December 29, 1961, only to divorce again on February 10, 1964, exactly two years before he died. (In the 1940s, Mathews had twice married and twice divorced comedian Milton Berle.) Later in 1964, Rose married Doris Ruth Vidor (n\u00e9e Warner; 1912-1978), who was the widow of film director Charles Vidor.\nBilly Rose founded the Billy Rose Sculpture Garden at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, Israel. His legendary pragmatism is illustrated by a seeming minor event at the sculpture garden opening ceremony, which Rose attended personally. When asked by one of the many distinguished guests what, in the event of war, Rose would have Israel do with these artworks, many of which were modern, steel abstracts, Rose unsmilingly replied, \"Melt them down for bullets.\"\nFrom 1949 until 1955, Rose was the owner-operator of the Ziegfeld Theatre. During that time, the theater housed four musicals and five plays. In 1965, he sold the theater to be demolished to make way for a new skyscraper, the Fisher Bros. Building.\nBilly Rose was a board member of American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers. ASCAP often slandered rock and roll songs. Because rock and roll performers increasingly wrote the music and lyrics themselves, professional songwriters lost their dominance in the music industry. As an ASCAP member, Billy Rose labeled rock and roll songs \"junk\" and was quoted as saying, \"in many cases they are obscene junk much on the level with dirty comic magazines.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

She worked for a year as stage manager of the Opera Company of Boston, but on the side began to write songs, record demo tapes, and take voice lessons. In 1990, Dar recorded her first album, I Have No History, produced by Jeannie Deva and engineered by Rob Lehmann at Oak Grove Studios in Malden, Massachusetts. One year later in 1991, Dar recorded her second album, All My Heroes Are Dead, most of which was recorded at Wellspring Sound in Newton, MA. This album included Dar's song \"Mark Rothko Song.\" The original recording of this song was later included in her third album The Honesty Room. In 1993 Williams moved to Northampton, Massachusetts. Early in Williams's music career, she opened for Joan Baez, who would make her relatively well known by recording some of her songs (Williams also dueted with Baez on Ring Them Bells). Her growing popularity has since relied heavily on community coffeehouses, public radio, and an extensive fan base on the Internet.Williams recorded her first full album, The Honesty Room, under her own label, Burning Field Music. Guest artists included Nerissa and Katryna Nields, Max Cohen and Gideon Freudmann. The album was briefly distributed by Chicago-based Waterbug Records. Williams soon secured a licensing-and-distribution deal for Burning Field with Razor and Tie, and in 1995 reissued the album on that label, with two re-recorded bonus tracks. The record went on to become one of the top-selling independent folk albums of the year. 1996's Mortal City, also licensed and distributed with Razor and Tie, received substantial notice, partially due to the fact that it coincided with her tour with Baez. The album again featured guest appearances by the Nields sisters and Freudmann, as well as noted folk artists John Prine, Cliff Eberhardt and Lucy Kaplansky. With that success, Razor & Tie re-released The Honesty Room. By the time of her third release, End of The Summer (1997), Williams's career had gathered substantial momentum, and the album did remarkably well, given its genre and independent label status.\nIn 1998, Williams, Richard Shindell and Lucy Kaplansky formed the group Cry Cry Cry as a way to pay homage to some of their favorite folk artists. The band released an eponymous album of covers and toured from 1998 to 2000.

When he was 16, Brad won a National Talent Contest during Country Music Week in Hamilton in 1982. He spent six years maintaining his solo career before teaming up with his brother Ken to form The Johner Brothers in 1988. After 14 years, six albums (including their Greatest Hits), 26 singles, one Canadian Country Music Association (CCMA) award and more than 40 awards from the Saskatchewan Country Music Association (SCMA), including Entertainer of the Decade, Ken decided to retire from the music business to pursue other interests in 2002.\nAfter the Johner Brothers dissolved, Brad returned to his solo career. He moved to Saskatoon with his wife Rhea and their five sons to begin work on his first solo album with producer Bart McKay. The album, Free, was released by Royalty Records in 2003. The album was nominated for Album of the Year by the CCMA and the Juno Awards, and won Outstanding Country Album at the 2003 Western Country Music Awards. In 2004, the Canadian Independent Music Awards named Johner Favourite Country Artist/Group of the Year. Brad won Male Vocalist of the Year at the 2003 SCMA, along with Single and Song of the Year for \"Hello.\" He cleaned up the following year at the SCMA ceremonies, winning Entertainer and Male Vocalist of the Year. \"Free\" was named Song, Single and Video of the Year, and Free won Album of the Year. His backup band, the Brad Johner Band, won Backup Band of the Year.\nAn American record label (Infinity Records Nashville) took notice of Brad, and re-released his debut album in the United States in 2004. The label folded before \"Free,\" the first single, took off at radio. Brad signed with Canadian label 306 Records for the release of his second album, Summertown Road, in 2005.

{"id": "264_848", "question": "What music label is Courage represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "740_18724", "text": "The chief music critic of The Guardian, Alexis Petridis, has described Marillion as \"perennially unfashionable prog-rockers\". On the subject of joining the band in 1989, Steve Hogarth said in a 2001 interview: \"At about the same time, Matt Johnson of The The asked me to play piano on his tour. I always say I had to make a choice between the most hip band in the world, and the least.\" In the same conversation, he said: \"We're just tired of the opinions of people who haven't heard anything we've done in ten years. A lot of what's spread about this band is laughable.\"Much of the band's enduring and unfashionable reputation stems from their emergence in the early 1980s as the most commercially successful band of the neo-prog movement, an unexpected revival of the progressive rock musical style that had fallen out of critical favour in the mid-1970s. Some early critics were quick to dismiss the band as clones of Peter Gabriel-era Genesis due to musical similarities, such as their extended songs, a prominent and Mellotron-influenced keyboard sound, vivid and fantastical lyrics and the equally vivid and fantastical artwork by Mark Wilkinson used for the sleeves of their albums and singles.  Lead singer Fish was also often compared with Gabriel due to his early vocal style and theatrical stage performances, which in the early years included wearing face paint.\n\nAs Jon Wilde summarised in Melody Maker in 1989: At the end of a strange year for pop music, Marillion appeared in November 1982 with \"Market Square Heroes\". There were many strange things about 1982, but Marillion were the strangest of them all. For six years, they stood out of time. Marillion were the unhippest group going.  As punk was becoming a distant echo, they appeared with a sound and an attitude that gazed back longingly to the age of Seventies pomp.  When compared to Yes, Genesis and ELP, they would take it as a compliment. The Eighties have seen some odd phenomena. But none quite as odd as Marillion. Along the way, as if by glorious fluke, they turned out some singles that everybody quietly liked \u2013 \"Garden Party\", \"Punch and Judy\" and \"Incommunicado\". By this time, Marillion did not need the support of the hip-conscious. They were massive. Perhaps the oddest thing about Marillion was that they became one of the biggest groups of the decade. They might have been an anomaly but they were monstrously effective.\nThe band's unfashionable reputation and image has often been mentioned in the media, even in otherwise positive reviews. In Q in 1987, David Hepworth wrote: \"Marillion may represent the inelegant, unglamorous, public bar end of the current Rock Renaissance but they are no less part of it for that. Clutching at Straws suggests that they may be finally coming in from the cold.\" In the same magazine in 1995, Dave Henderson wrote: \"It's not yet possible to be sacked for showing an affinity for Marillion, but has there ever been a band with a larger stigma attached?\" He also argued that if the album Afraid of Sunlight \"had been made by a new, no baggage-of-the-past combo, it would be greeted with open arms, hailed as virtual genius.\" In Record Collector in 2002, Tim Jones argued they were \"one of the most unfairly berated bands in Britain\" and \"one of its best live rock acts.\" In 2004, Classic Rock's Jon Hotten wrote: \"That genre thing has been a bugbear of Marillion's, but it no longer seems relevant. What are Radiohead if not a progressive band?\" and said Marillion were \"making strong, singular music with the courage of their convictions, and we should treasure them more than we do.\" In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, an article on Marillion written by Mick Wall described them as \"probably the most misunderstood band in the world\".\nIn 2007, Stephen Dalton of The Times stated: The band have just released their 14th album, Somewhere Else, which is really rather good. Containing tracks that shimmer like Coldplay, ache like Radiohead and thunder like Muse, it is better than 80 per cent of this month's releases. But you are unlikely to hear Marillion on British radio, read about them in the music press or see them play a major festival. This is largely because Marillion have \u2013 how can we put this kindly? \u2013 an image problem. Their music is still perceived as bloated, bombastic mullet-haired prog-rock, even by people who have never heard it. In fairness, they did once release an album called Script for a Jester's Tear. But, come on, we all had bad hair days in the 1980s.\nDespite publishing a very good review for their 1995 album Afraid of Sunlight and including it in their 50 Best Albums of 1995, Q refused to interview the band or write a feature on them. Steve Hogarth later said: \"How can they say, this is an amazing record... no, we don't want to talk to you? It's hard to take when they say, here's a very average record... we'll put you on the front cover.\"In 2001, the television critic of The Guardian, Gareth McLean, used his review of the Michael Lewis BBC Two documentary, Next: The Future Just Happened, to concentrate on launching a scathing attack on the band, whose appearance only constituted one segment of the programme. He described them as \"once dodgy and now completely rubbish\" and he characterised their fans as \"slightly simple folks\". He also dismissed the band's efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: \"One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion.\"Rachel Cooke, a writer for The Observer and New Statesman, has repeatedly referred negatively to the band and insulted their fans in her articles.\nIn an interview in 2000, Hogarth expressed regret about the band retaining their name after he joined: If we had known when I joined Marillion what we know now, we'd have changed the name and been a new band. It was a mistake to keep the name, because what it represented in the mid-Eighties is a millstone we now carry. If we'd changed it, I think we would have been better off. We would have been judged for our music. It's such a grave injustice that the media constantly calls us a 'dinosaur prog band'. They only say that out of ignorance because they haven't listened to anything we've done for the last 15 bloody years. If you hear anything we've done in the last five or six years, that description is totally irrelevant... It's a massive frustration that no-one will play our stuff. If we send our single to Radio 1 they say: 'Sorry, we don't play music by bands who are over so-many years old... and here's the new U2 single.' I suppose it's something everyone has to cope with \u2013 every band are remembered for their big hit single, irrespective of how much they change over the years. But you can only transcend that by continuing to have hits. It's Catch 22. You know, at some stage, someone has to notice that we're doing interesting things. Someday someone will take a retrospective look at us and be surprised.\nThe 2013 film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa includes a joke reference to a former drummer of the band. The band were quoted: \"We know Marillion are seen as 'uncool' but we were delighted to be a part of it.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "264_849", "question": "What music label is The Standells represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_55331", "text": "The Standells band was formed in 1962 by lead vocalist and keyboard player Larry Tamblyn (born Lawrence Arnold Tamblyn, February 5, 1943), guitarist Tony Valentino (born Emilio Bellissimo, May 24, 1941), bass guitarist Jody Rich, and drummer Benny King (aka Hernandez). Tamblyn had previously been a solo performer, recording several 45 singles in the late 1950s and early 1960s including \"Dearest\", \"Patty Ann\", \"This Is The Night\", \"My Bride To Be\" and \"Destiny\" for Faro and Linda Records. He is the brother of actor Russ Tamblyn and the uncle of actor Amber Tamblyn.\nThe Standells band name was created by Larry Tamblyn, derived from standing around booking agents' offices trying to get work. In early 1962, drummer Benny King joined the group, and as \"the Standels\", their first major performance was in Honolulu at the Oasis Club. After several months, Rich and King departed. Tamblyn then assumed leadership of the group. He and Valentino re-formed the Standels, adding bass guitarist Gary Lane (September 18, 1938 \u2013 November 5, 2014) and drummer Gary Leeds, later known as Gary Walker of The Walker Brothers. Later that year, the band lengthened its name to \"Larry Tamblyn & the Standels\". In 1963 an extra \"L\" was added, and as \"Larry Tamblyn and the Standells\" the group made its first recording \"You'll Be Mine Someday/Girl In My Heart\" for Linda Records (released in 1964). In the latter part of the year, the band permanently shortened its name to \"The Standells\". After the Standells signed with Liberty in 1964, Leeds left the group, and was replaced by lead vocalist and drummer Dick Dodd. Dodd was a former Mouseketeer who had been the original drummer for The Bel-Airs, known for the surf rock song \"Mr. Moto\", and eventually became the singer who sang lead on all of the Standells hit songs.\nIn 1964, Liberty Records released three Standells singles and an album, The Standells in Person at P.J.s. The album was later re-issued as The Standells Live and Out of Sight. The band also appeared on The Munsters TV show, as themselves in the episode \"Far Out Munsters,\" performing \"Come On and Ringo\" and a version of The Beatles' \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\". In late 1964, they signed with Vee Jay and released two singles in 1965. Later in the year they signed with MGM for one single.\nThe group appeared in several low-budget films of the 1960s, including Get Yourself a College Girl (1964) and cult classic Riot on Sunset Strip (1967). The Standells performed incidental music in the 1963 Connie Francis movie Follow the Boys, which coincidentally co-starred Larry Tamblyn's brother, Russ Tamblyn. The Standells played the part of the fictional rock group the \"Love Bugs\" on the television sitcom Bing Crosby Show in the January 18, 1965, episode \"Bugged by the Love Bugs\". In addition to appearing in the aforementioned The Munsters episode as themselves, they also appeared performing an instrumental in the background in the March 29, 1965 Ben Casey series episode, \"Three 'Lil Lambs.\" The band also performed the title song for the 1965 children's movie, Zebra in the Kitchen.\nSome reports state that early versions of the band had a relatively clean image and performed only cover songs. However, early 1964 photos counter that notion, showing the Standells with long hair, making them one of the first American rock groups to adopt that style. In order to work in conservative nightclubs like P.J.'s, the group members were forced to cut their shaggy locks. Like the Beatles, early rock groups did mostly cover songs in nightclubs.\nIn 1965 the group \u2013 Dodd, Tamblyn, Valentino and Lane \u2013 signed with Capitol Records' label Tower, teaming up with producer Ed Cobb. Cobb wrote the group's most popular song, \"Dirty Water\", which the band recorded in late 1965. The song's references to the city of Boston are owed to Cobb's experiences with a mugger in Boston. The song also makes reference to the Boston Strangler and the dorm curfews for college women in those days.\"Dirty Water\" reached No. 11 on the Billboard charts on June 11, 1966, No. 8 on the Cashbox charts on July 9, 1966, and No. 1 on the Record World charts. \"Dirty Water\" was on the WLS playlist for 17 total weeks, tied only by \"California Dreamin'\" for most weeks on that playlist during the 1960s. Though the song is credited solely to Cobb, band members Dodd, Valentino and Tamblyn have claimed substantial material-of-fact song composition copyright contributions to it as well as contributing to its arrangement. Tamblyn has stated that Cobb's version was a \"standard blues song\", adding: \"We took the song with the condition that we could arrange in any way we want; we added the guitar riff into it and all of the wonderful vocal asides like, 'I'm gonna tell you a story, It's all about my town, I'm going to tell you a big fat story'...that was all written by us.\"\nAccording to critic Richie Unterberger,\"Dirty Water\" [was] an archetypal garage rock hit with its Stones-ish riff, lecherous vocal, and combination of raunchy guitar and organ. While they never again reached the Top 40, they cut a number of strong, similar tunes in the 1966\u20131967 era that have belatedly been recognized as 1960s punk classics. \"Garage rock\" may not have been a really accurate term for them in the first place, as the production on their best material was full and polished, with some imaginative touches of period psychedelia and pop. \"Dirty Water\" is listed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\"Dodd briefly left the Standells in early 1966, and was replaced by Dewey Martin, who became a member of Buffalo Springfield. Dodd returned to the group a few months later, as the \"Dirty Water\" song began to climb the charts. The band recorded additional songs for their first full studio album Dirty Water in April 1966. Another popular track on the album was \"Sometimes Good Guys Don't Wear White\", which would later be recorded by Washington, D.C. hardcore band Minor Threat, New York City punk band The Cramps, and Swedish garage band The Nomads.\nThe follow-up studio album, Why Pick on Me \u2014 Sometimes Good Guys Don't Wear White, was released in November 1966 and included the single \"Why Pick on Me\", which peaked at No. 54 on the Billboard chart. Gary Lane left the Standells in 1966, and was replaced by bass guitarist Dave Burke. John Fleck (born John William Fleckenstein in Los Angeles, August 2, 1946 \u2013 October 18, 2017), formerly of Love, soon replaced Burke in early 1967. The band then released their third album, The Hot Ones! In early 1967. It was simply a selection of popular songs that they covered. The band's fourth studio album, Try It, released in October 1967, contained the song \"Riot on Sunset Strip\", which had been released earlier in 1967 to support the soundtrack for the movie of the same name. The title track \"Try It\" was later recorded by Ohio Express and Cobra Killer. Picked by Billboard magazine to be the Standells' next hit, \"Try It\" was banned by Texas radio mogul Gordon McLendon, who deemed the record to have sexually suggestive lyrics. The Standells were asked by Art Linkletter to debate with McLendon on his House Party TV show in 1967. By most accounts, McLendon was handily defeated, but, by then, most radio stations had followed McLendon's lead and would not play the record. A third single released from this album, \"Can't Help But Love You\", would be the Standells last entry into the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 78, while also peaking at No. 9 in the Cashbox charts.\nIn 1968, Dick Dodd left the band to pursue a solo career. The Standells continued to perform with a varying line-up thereafter, briefly including guitarist Lowell George who went on to play with Little Feat.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The sisters' parents, Vonnie Geneva (n\u00e9e Gray; 1932\u20132018) and Clyde D. \"Bunk\" Forester, would encourage the four to rehearse music for church choir every week, something which Christy later observed would help the sisters learn how to sing in harmony.In addition to their church work, Kathy and June performed in local bands during the late 1970s while also holding jobs as schoolteachers. After Christy had finished college, the four sisters decided to begin performing professionally. Songwriters Bobby Keel and Billy Stone discovered them at a local music festival, and invited them to record a demo at a music studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The demo tape was sent to Paige Rowden, the artists and repertoire representative for Warner Bros. Records' Nashville division, who arranged for them to audition at the label after hearing them open for Larry Gatlin. Jim Ed Norman, a record producer who was then also the president of Warner Bros. Nashville, signed the sisters in late 1984. According to Kim, when the sisters were first contacted by the label, she thought that the call was a prank and immediately hung up before the label called a second time.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

The band made further headway by contributing the aforementioned \"Calling For You\" to  the \"Heavy Metal Heroes Vol. 2\" compilation album (Heavy Metal Records, 1982) and a new cut, \"50.000 Stallions\", to the 60 Minutes Plus cassette compilation (Neat Records, 1982), also issued on vinyl as All Hell Let Loose by Neat in conjunction with Italy's Base Records label in 1983. Adding to their tally, the band followed it up with the \"Ridin' High\" b/w \"Hurt You\" single through Neat, which earned Risk their strongest reviews yet.It would turn out to be the final recording with drummer Razz who was sacked in late 1983. He was briefly superseded by Dixie Lee (ex-Lone Star, Wild Horses) before a more permanent replacement was a found in Steve Hopgood (ex-Chinatown, Shy). The band also added a new second guitarist, Graham Bath (ex-Sphinx). Persian Risk were dealt a significant blow when founding member Phil Campbell successfully auditioned for Mot\u00f6rhead, who would tap his old band for the support slot on their 1984 UK tour. Campbell's successor was Phil Vokins (ex-Tyrant, Wrathchild).  Risk also signed a new record deal with London-based Zebra Records and issued the Too Different 12\" EP in 1984 which saw the band temper their raw approach in favor of a somewhat more polished sound.That same year, Persian Risk made their one and only national UK TV appearance when the band performed three songs \u2013 \"Women In Rock\", \"Rise Up\", and \"Too Different\" \u2013 on Channel 4's ECT program.

During the last ice age these rocks were carved by glaciers to create the landforms seen today.\nSince the end of the last ice age, small populations of arctic-alpine plants have survived in favourable spots on rock ledges high in the eastern coves. Rare to Britain species of alpine butterfly, the mountain ringlet, also live on and around Helvellyn.\nMineral veins, some with deposits of the lead ore galena, do exist within Helvellyn's rocks, but attempts to find sufficient quantities of lead to be worth mining have not been successful.\nThe top of Helvellyn is a broad plateau, trending roughly from north-west to south-east for about a kilometre between Lower Man and the start of Striding Edge. Throughout this distance it remains more than 900 m (3,000 ft) high. To the west the ground drops gently at first but then more steeply down to Thirlmere, while on the eastern side three deep glacial coves, each backed by high cliffs, are separated by two spectacular sharp ridges or ar\u00eates. The middle of these coves contains Red Tarn.\nLike much of the main ridge of the range, Helvellyn stands on the watershed between Thirlmere and the Derwent river system to the west, and Ullswater and the Eden river system to the east.Streams on the west side drain directly into Thirlmere, apart from Helvellyn Gill which flows into a parallel valley to the east of Great How and empties into St John's Beck. However, when Thirlmere reservoir was built, a leat was constructed to capture the water of Helvellyn Gill, so that it is now directed into the reservoir.\nA never-failing spring called Brownrigg Well exists 90 m (300 ft) below the summit of Helvellyn, about 500 m (550 yd) due west of the highest point, at the head of Whelpside Gill. In the nineteenth century a leat was constructed to direct the water of this spring into the gill to its north to serve the needs of the Helvellyn Mine further down. This leat has now fallen into disuse. The gill it led to is not named on any map, but some authors have referred to it as Mines Gill.Whelp Side, between Whelpside Gill and Mines Gill, appears as a distinct shoulder of the mountain when seen from the west, largely grassy though with a few crags and boulders in places, and with coniferous plantations on its lower slopes which were planted to stabilise the land around the reservoir. North of Mines Gill are the Helvellyn Screes, a more craggy stretch of hillside, beneath the north-west ridge, with a loose scree covering in places.\nThe deep coves on the rocky eastern side of Helvellyn drain into Ullswater. Water from Brown Cove and Red Tarn unite below Catstye Cam to form Glenridding Beck, which flows through Glenridding village to the lake, while Nethermost Cove drains into the same lake via Grisedale Beck and Patterdale village.\nRed Tarn, enclosed between Striding Edge and Swirral Edge, is about 25 m (82 ft) deep, but in the mid-nineteenth century a dam was built to increase its capacity and supply the needs of the Greenside Mine near Glenridding. That dam has now gone and the tarn has returned to its natural size. It contains brown trout and schelly, a species of whitefish found in only four bodies of water in the Lake District.A second reservoir was built around 1860 in Brown Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, along with one further down the valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine. The dam in Keppel Cove is still in place, but water now leaks through its base. The remains of the dam in Brown Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear whether there ever was a natural tarn in Brown Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn to the north of Swirral Edge.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The name \"Memphis\", which the rapper explained paid homage to pimps, was a backronym for \"Making Easy Money, Pimping Hoes In Style\" and \"Bleek\" was a childhood nickname stemming from his younger sister trying to pronounce his first name, Malik. Bleek's first official appearance was on \"Coming of Age\" from Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt (1996), followed by an appearance on \"Can I Live II\", released on the reissued version of the album. He appeared on subsequent Jay-Z albums: Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life (1998), Vol. 3\u2026 Life and Times of S. Carter (1999), The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000), and The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002). After the widescale success of Vol 2\u2026 Hard Knock Life, the label released Bleek's debut album, Coming of Age (1999). The album was the week's Hot Shot Debut on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 7 with 118,000 units sold in its first week. Bleek launched his own label, Get Low Records in 1998.\nThereafter, he released three follow-up albums for the label: The Understanding (2000), M.A.D.E. (2003), and 534 (2005). Coming of Age and The Understanding were both certified gold by the RIAA. In between the release of The Understanding and M.A.D.E., he took a three-year hiatus, in which he took care of his older brother, who was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. 534 was named after the building number of the housing project in which he and Jay-Z grew up, and became the first release from the \"new\" Roc-A-Fella, referring to Jay-Z becoming the president of Def Jam Recordings prior to its release. A song from the album, titled \"Dear Summer\", is performed solely by Jay-Z and refers to what he called the time of the year in which he would drop a classic album or single consecutively for eight years, and how he had to metaphorically leave \"her\" (Summer). \"Dear Summer\" would mark Jay-Z's first song since beginning his brief \"retirement\" in late 2003. 534 also contains one of the first recordings by Def Jam labelmate turned international star, Rihanna, who featured on the song \"The One\".Memphis Bleek's highest charting single was \"Is That Yo Chick\", featuring Missy Elliott and Jay-Z, which peaked at number 7 on the Hot Rap Singles Billboard chart and number 68 on the Billboard Hot 100. Other charting singles include \"It's Alright\", which also featured Jay-Z and peaked at number 61.In fall 2005, Memphis Bleek told MTV that he was recording an album called The Process, that he would describe as a make or break album, saying \"I want to do an album that's through the roof, I want to do a classic album. I feel that if this album I'm not recording is a classic, I'm not even gonna put it out. I have to do it bigger than anybody has ever done it. I have to make a good record this time, not just talking-junk records.\" The rapper has worked on the album since 2005, and during that time frame he would release the promotional singles: \"Hustla\", \"Get Ya Money Off\" and \"Let It Off\". As of 2024, the album has yet to be released. Memphis Bleek would eventually leave Roc-A-Fella in 2009, after Jay-Z told him he could run his own company and had the proper distribution deals to do so.

Its style of \"state-of-the-art pop/rock circa 1978\", as AllMusic's William Ruhlmann described it, showed Blondie deviating from new wave and emerging as \"a pure pop band\". Ken Tucker believed the band had eschewed the \"brooding artiness\" of their previous albums for more hooks and pop-oriented songs. Chapman later said, \"I didn't make a punk album or a New Wave album with Blondie. I made a pop album.\" The album's eleven pop songs have refined melodics, and its sole disco song, \"Heart of Glass\", features jittery keyboards, rustling cymbals by drummer Clem Burke, and a circular rhythm. Burke credited Kraftwerk and the soundtrack to the film Saturday Night Fever as influences for the song and said that he was \"trying to get that groove that the drummer for the Bee Gees had\".Lyrically, Parallel Lines abandoned what Rolling Stone magazine's Arion Berger called the \"cartoonish postmodernist referencing\" of Blondie's previous new wave songs in favor of a \"romantic fatalism\" that was new for the band. \"Sunday Girl\" deals with the theme of teen loneliness.

Many long-time fans criticized the album's sound, which bore little relation to the gothic/folk/progressive rock of the band's past.  With the band now consisting solely of leader Warren Defever and vocalist Lovetta Pippen, an experienced soul and gospel singer who had first appeared as a part of a gospel choir on 1996's Stars on ESP, Someday... is basically a straightforward soul and R&B album.  This was the first HNIA album without long-time vocalist Karin Oliver, whose unique vocal range was, for many fans, the band's key element.\nOn the other hand, there are some fans who appreciate the album for what it is, noting Defever's characteristic songwriting, production and musicianship, and Pippen's impressive vocal skills.  Album reviews were also favorable from publications who were unfamiliar with the band's back catalog.\nThe replacement of Oliver with Pippen as primary vocalist lead some to believe that Defever had fired Oliver, which tainted the opinions of fans without even hearing the album.  The truth was that Oliver had always held jobs in marketing and advertising during her time with HNIA, as the band had never been a commercial success.  With the changes at 4AD (outlined in the article on the previous album, Ft. Lake), 4AD had increased commercial expectations for the band.  When Ft. Lake was not a big seller, Oliver chose to accept a full-time job offer in marketing, more out of reasons of feasibility than any hostility between her and Defever. Oliver left the band after the US release party for Ft. Lake; a tape of this concert is available from Time Stereo.  She was replaced on the resulting tour with Erika Hoffman, who had also been contributing since Stars on ESP.\nDefever and Pippen recorded the album from 1998 through 2000.  The release of the album was delayed for a year.  While 4AD's official reason for the delay was that the elaborate V23 artwork was difficult to produce, there was also speculation that the label was unhappy with the album and had no idea how to market it.  The label decided not to renew their option on the band's contract beyond the next album, about six months before Someday... was released.  Defever and Pippen were encouraged to go ahead and record the final album of the contract right away.  The album, which turned out to be 2002's Last Night, was recorded before Someday... was released, and like its predecessor, was shelved for a year before being released.\nThe UK version of the album comes in a digipak case with a lyrics booklet in addition to the liner notes, as opposed to the U.S. version which comes in a jewel case and lacks the lyrics booklet.  The U.K. version also has slightly different artwork, with the front cover image being in blue which was changed to brown for the U.S. version.", "hasanswer": false}]}

For more than 40 years, this freakadelic folk-rock band... had lasting influence on fans wild and crazy enough to be in on the acquired-taste secret of their art.\" Writing for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger called the band \"almost the very definition of a cult act... Their audience was small because their music was too strange, idiosyncratic, and at times downright dissonant for mainstream listeners to abide.\"The band's frequent drug use as well as Stampfel and Weber's creative differences also hindered a breakthrough. Peter Stampfel reflected that \"there was just too much drugs, alcohol, and bad attitude in the band\" to \"capitalize on our positive aspects.\" NPR noted that the band exhibited \"self-destructive behavior\" that led to an early breakup and an inability to capitalize on the inclusion of \"Bird Song\" on Easy Rider's commercially successful soundtrack. Dave Van Ronk thought similarly: \"that was their moment right there. If they had been able to capitalize on [Easy Rider], they would have been two very very wealthy men. But somehow or another it just didn't happen.\" The band's former road manager Jack Gallagher recalled in the early 2000s that \"managing them was like herding snakes\" but put the band's lack of success more squarely on Weber, questioning whether Weber would even complete the band's current tour and saying that Weber \"never crashes until the money gets real good.\"Despite the band's lack of critical and commercial success during their initial run in the 1960s and 1970s, they have since earned significant praise, in particular for their groundbreaking reworking of 1920s and 1930s folk music.

Her performances at local competitions led to a meeting with local theater producer Monica Ariza, who later held an audition for her in Bogot\u00e1. She performed three songs for executives of Sony Music Colombia, who were impressed enough to sign her, at the age of 13, to record three albums, which were Magia, Peligro and Pies Descalzos.The low-budget Magia was put in almost three months of pre-production, which involved choreography of live performances for the album, singing lessons for Shakira, and arranging the songs. The concept of the music still reflected her personality, despite the fact that it was managed by the record label. The tracks deal with emotions of a person's first time falling in love, and range from a love poem (\"Sue\u00f1os\") to a celebration of dance (\"Esta noche voy contigo\"). These were influenced from experiences with males such as her ex-boyfriend Oscar Pardo, stories told by her father, and dreams of living on the coast. In the book Shakira: Woman Full of Grace, Ximena Diego wrote that the album \"demonstrated her [Shakira's] indisputable potential.\"Magia is a collection of songs written by Shakira between the ages of 8 and 12, and mainly consists of pop ballads.

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

We are mostly influenced by Swedish bands and Carcass. The heavy end of our sound is the American style creeping in, with some Floridian influences like Morbid Angel, Malevolent Creation and that kind of stuff.

After moving to New York City, Clarke did one-man performance art shows. Although believing rock bands to be less artistic, he was persuaded to reform a band, which he named Warrior Soul after a line in a George S. Patton docudrama.The band began to play in New York City in 1987, and soon came to the attention of Geffen, who signed the band. Geffen directed Clarke to shed his hired band and get new players. Clarke insisted on keeping Pete McClanahan as his bass player, and recruited guitarist John Ricco and former Killing Joke drummer Paul Ferguson.In 1990, Warrior Soul released their first album, Last Decade Dead Century. AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia compared it to Nirvana's Nevermind, saying that although comparable success eluded Warrior Soul, it explored similar themes.  Rivadavia speculated that the nihilism of Nevermind may have resonated more with Generation X.1991 saw Ferguson replaced on drums by Mark Evans, and the band's second album Drugs, God and the New Republic released, which took their anarchist leanings even further. A nationwide support tour with Queensr\u00ffche (with whom they shared management from the Q Prime agency) followed.The following year saw the release of the band's third album, 1992's Salutations from the Ghetto Nation, and Clarke's relationship with Geffen sour. Clarke's interviews became increasingly bitter, often focusing on the band's record label, whom he accused of ignoring the group's potential. Eventually, Clarke resorted to an all-out war, telling all that the band's fourth release, 1993's Chill Pill had been botched on purpose in order to fulfill the band's contract. The ploy seemed to work, and by early 1994 Warrior Soul were dropped by Geffen.A number of lineup changes ensued. Longtime guitarist John Ricco was ousted, replaced by two guitarists:  Alexander Arundel (aka X-Factor aka Gene Poole ) and Chris Moffet (former Cycle Sluts from Hell lead guitarist). Not long after, Mark Evans and Chris Moffet departed. At that time former Nuclear Assault/Cities/Cycle Sluts from Hell drummer Scott Duboys joined the band. The line-up now consisted of Clarke, Arundel, McClanahan and Duboys. Clarke sought to reinvent Warrior Soul as self-appointed cyberpunks for their fifth album, 1994's The Space Age Playboys, released on the independent Futurist label. At this time adding old friend and collaborator, Peter Jay on rhythm guitar. While touring in support of the album, Warrior Soul headlined the 1995 Kerrang! UK tour, as well as performing at the 1995 Dynamo Open Air Festival, and also at the 1995 Donnington Monsters of Rock concert.\nAfter the performance of their last live show in September 1995, Arundel, Duboys, and longtime bassist McClanahan quit the band, leading in short order to Clarke's decision to retire the band later that year.\nIn 1996, Odds & Ends was released as a collection of demos recorded on an eight-track with Arundel, and leftover material that was originally intended for release on Elektra Records.\nThe \"classic\" lineup of Clarke, Ricco, McClanahan, and Evans later reunited for a short tour and to go in the studio to re-record twelve of the bands' songs, released on Dream Catcher Records as Classics in 2000.  All Warrior Soul albums were remastered and re-released on CD and MP3 in 2006 and 2009, including with bonus material (mostly live songs originally released as b-sides).  The first three albums were also re-released on vinyl in 2009.\nClarke says many of their songs are politically based, such as \"Blown Away\", \"Superpower Dreamland\", \"In Conclusion\", and \"Children of the Winter\". Clarke describes the band's sound as \"acid punk\", particularly their The Space Age Playboys album.\nDrummer Mark Evans was murdered in London, England, in 2005.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They had previously worked together as the Wildings, and then the Patterns with Robert Cubitt and Tom Fawcett. The Patterns became the Native Hipsters in 1979 when they recorded \"There Goes Concorde Again\", a 6:45 minute song featuring Blatt repeating with \"childlike enthusiasm\" the refrain \"Ooh, look, there goes Concorde again\", with reference to sightings of the famed \"silverbird\". AllMusic described the song as a \"formless composition\" with \"perfectly-devoid-of-skill vocals, a wobbly funhouse synth, the occasional guitar pling, and not much bass\".\"There Goes Concorde Again\" was a home recording that was privately released by the group as a single in a limited edition of 500 copies. Each disc had its label hand-stamped by the group, and the sleeves were cut from advertising posters (including one of Kevin Keegan, an English footballer), making each cover virtually unique. They sent the records to Rough Trade, an independent record shop in London, and about a month later BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel picked up a copy and began playing the song extensively on his radio program. Soon the group had an order for another 1,000 copies, and then a further 4,000. The song entered the UK Independent Charts in August 1980, where it remained for ten weeks, peaking at number five. Wilding received an offer from producer Tony Visconti to re-record the song, but turned it down for fear of it becoming \"too commercial\". The song was later listed by New Musical Express in their \"NME Writers 100 Best Indie Singles Ever\" in 1992.In 1982 the Native Hipsters released a four-track EP, \"Tenderly Hurt Me\" which was well received by the music press. Over the next few years the group performed live several times, including opening for Bauhaus, and recorded a number of songs with the help of various musicians, including guitarist Lester Square from The Monochrome Set, and Annie Whitehead, a session trombonist. By the mid-1980s the group had stopped recording, but interest in them was revived in 2001 when Rough Trade included \"There Goes Concorde Again\" in a box set, Rough Trade Shops \u2013 25 Years. This prompted Wilding to release two CDs, There Goes Concorde Again... (2001) and Songs to Protest About (2006) containing their singles, previously unreleased songs and new material.

According to Pitchfork, \"there isn't an easy descriptor for Glasser's sound-- she incorporates bits of tropical pop, tribal percussion, and a couple of different strains of electronic music. Her songs sidestep traditionally linear arrangements for a more open, circular approach-- they kind of swoosh around without pausing at verse-chorus intersections.\"Glasser's second album, Interiors, came out in 2013. The album was inspired, according to Mesirow, by Dutch architect and theorist Rem Koolhaas' 1978 book Delirious New York. The album's themes and sounds reflected the artist's move from Los Angeles to downtown Manhattan. \"The interiors Glasser explores,\" wrote Pitchfork, \"most compellingly are, it won't surprise you at this point to learn, the ones within human beings.

I don't care who listens to our records.

Furthermore, the band appears at Christian music festivals such as Parachute Music Festival and Cornerstone Festival, and their songs have been included on Christian rock compilation CDs and DVDs.  They are also played on the Gospel Music Channel.Anberlin has also been repeatedly featured in Christian rock magazine HM (Hard Music, which was originally the fanzine Heaven's Metal). Christian submitted a letter to the magazine, criticizing the more overtly religious Christian punk band the Knights of the New Crusade for a promotional image that represented a \"black mark on the face of Christianity\".Christian has also said in an interview with Lightforce radio how the band tries to \"step out of the bubble\" and referred to themselves as being part of Christian music. He discussed in detail what Christians should do in their lives: love and embrace others as Jesus would as well as show God's grace to others. He mentioned as well how the band Fall Out Boy said in an interview that they did not really know much about Jesus until Anberlin toured with them.In an interview with Smartpunk, drummer Nathan Young commented, \"The thing is, some bands that are trying to get out of the Christian market, they get bummed out by questions about it.

American Songwriter writes that \"Hayes received his first guitar from actor Robert Duvall at age 6\" At age 7, he was invited to perform for President Bill Clinton for a White House lawn party.

(The club made several appearances in movies like Dolemite and Black Fist.) Simmons' nightclub booked R&B-oriented musical acts, and Simmons' interest in music led him to buy a recording studio. In 1978, he signed a little-known R&B act, the Greenwood, Archer and Pine Street Band, (shortened in 1973 by a typo to the Gap Band) to his production company, and secured a record deal with Mercury Records. The band, consisting of twelve members, was reduced officially to the three Wilson brothers. Their first Total Experience-produced single, 1979's \"Shake\", went to #4 on the R&B charts.\nSimmons' skills as a composer, however, would take the Gap Band to the next level. When they released The Gap Band II late in 1979, a song Simmons co-wrote with the Wilson brothers, \"Oops Up Side Your Head\", not only matched the success of \"Shake\" on the R&B charts, reaching #4 also, but exceeded it by propelling the album to over half-a-million in sales. Simmons had co-written only one song on The Gap Band but co-wrote six of The Gap Band II's seven tracks.\nIn 1980, Charlie Wilson went on a trip to Dallas and returned with two new friends: Cavin Yarbrough and Alisa Peoples. After a brief audition, Simmons exchanged contact information with them. When they showed up in LA, he suggested they record a demo with the label's other producer, who also served as their songwriter. They recorded the demo, and when he heard it, Simmons had yet another act in his ranks: Yarbrough and Peoples. That year, Simmons co-wrote two songs which peaked on the R&B charts at #1 back-to-back: \"Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)\", which was released on The Gap Band III, and \"Don't Stop the Music\", which was released on Yarbrough & Peoples' debut album, The Two of Us. The latter album went gold, while the former went platinum, selling over a million copies.\nSimmon's winning streak continued in 1981, when he formed Total Experience Records and convinced Mercury's parent company PolyGram to distribute the label's recordings. He then transferred the Gap Band and Yarbrough & Peoples (who were already signed to his production company) to the Total Experience label. Gap Band IV was released in early 1982 and spawned three singles, which all peaked in the top-40 on the dance charts and top-2 on the R&B songs: #1 \"Early in the Morning\", #2 \"You Dropped a Bomb on Me\" (both of which Simmons helped write), and #1 \"Outstanding\", the first two of which Simmons wrote. The album went platinum within a year. Later in 1982, he signed Robert \"Goodie\" Whitfield to the label. His debut album, Call Me Goodie, peaked at #31 R&B.\nThe Gap Band's 1983 release, Gap Band V: Jammin' (#2 R&B, #28 Billboard 200), saw Simmons take a reduced writing/producing role; he co-wrote only one song. The album went gold, headlined by the only Simmons co-penned single, \"Party Train\", which went to #3 on the R&B charts. Yarbrough and Peoples released Heartbeats that year, and it peaked at #25 R&B, and the title track went to #10 R&B. One of their 1984 singles, \"Be a Winner\", topped the R&B charts.\nIn 1984, Total Experience began a new distribution deal with RCA Records.\nEven though his two major acts produced hits well into the mid-80s, Total Experience began to falter. During 1984 and 1985, the label expanded from three acts to fourteen, including Bernie Hamilton & the Inculcation Band and Switch. Not a single one of the newcomers released more than one album with Total Experience (two of them only produced one song) and none of them scored any hits. Meanwhile, Yarbrough and Peoples got married and moved back to Texas, and Goodie quit. This left the Gap Band as the label's sole act by 1986.\nThe Gap Band's subsequent releases, Gap Band VII and Gap Band 8, received chart success due to heavy radio airplay but sold few actual copies. The Gap Band's final hurrah with Total Experience, Straight from the Heart, got a top-40 song from the title track but failed to sell, causing the Gap Band to leave for Capitol Records.\nWith no acts remaining, Lonnie dropped out of music, and his company turned to motion picture and video production.\nSimmons died on February 6, 2019.", "hasanswer": false}]}

I think it was something we just accidentally happened onto. By my being versatile. By my being able to sing different songs \u2013 being able to change my tone quality, having the different octaves. You must remember, I was capable of singing anything.\"\nBurke recalled: \"They weren\u2019t happy with my rendition, because I felt I had to talk.

The trains weren't running, but I made it in that morning and there was Solomon, who had come up from Philadelphia. We did four songs in three hours, including 'Just Out of Reach'. After we finished recording, I went into the control room to listen to the playback. I looked around for Solomon, but he was heading out the door. He said he had to get back to Philadelphia while it was still light because he had a job shoveling snow. I think he was getting paid $3.50 an hour. He already had something like eight kids.\" According to Tony Cummings, \"Despite the use of a different arranger at each session Solomon conquered all.

The first of these took place in the spring of 1977, just after the conclusion of the first season. Fawcett turned in her resignation just before the season one finale aired on May 4, 1977. Fawcett's decision not to return for a second season triggered a lawsuit against the actress by ABC and Spelling.During the 1977 summer hiatus of the series, ABC and Fawcett entered a legal battle over her contract. At the beginning of the series, all three female leads signed five-year contracts, and the network was insistent that they live up to their commitments. Business partners Leonard Goldberg and Aaron Spelling tried to work out a deal with Fawcett and her agents. Goldberg and Spelling had arranged for her to make one film during her summer hiatuses, and her choice over subsequent television shows and miniseries. ABC even agreed to raise her salary from $5,000 to $8,000 a week, but she declined those offers. ABC reluctantly released her from her series contract in the summer of 1977. However, she was assigned to another contract with ABC, stating that since she left her contract four years early that she would return to the series later on in its run for six guest appearances. Fawcett would return as Jill Munroe on Charlie's Angels for three guest appearances in season three, and again returned for three more in season four.\n\nAs Fawcett departed the series, ABC began searching for her replacement. Executives eventually noticed singer turned actress Cheryl Ladd and offered her a screen test. Initially, Ladd refused the opportunity for a screen test, but after lobbying from studio executives, she relented. Although executives noticed Ladd was inexperienced, they saw promise in her performance and signed her to a four-year contract. In an effort to keep the hype the series had with Fawcett, Ladd was written in the series as her sister, San Francisco police academy graduate Kris Munroe.Ratings dropped during the third season. Jackson began to complain about the show's diminishing script quality (she once complained: \"The scripts are so light it would take a week to get to the floor if you dropped it from the ceiling\") and further stated that initially the series focused on \"classic detective work\", but had become more of a \"cop story of the week\". During the third season, Jackson was offered the part of Joanna Kramer in Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) with Dustin Hoffman but the Charlie's Angels producers refused to reorganize the shooting schedule to allow Jackson time off to shoot the film (the part of Joanna ultimately went to Meryl Streep, who won an Academy Award for her performance). Upset by this situation and her negative opinion of the scripts, Jackson became problematic, as she admitted, \"I guess I did cause a few problems\" and she was let go. In a statement, Spelling said: \"Due to problems on the set, Kate is being dropped for the good of the show\".Casting calls for Jackson's replacement began during the summer of 1979. Several up-and-coming actresses were considered for the role, including Barbara Bach, Connie Sellecca, Shari Belafonte, Judith Chapman, newcomer Michelle Pfeiffer and The Price Is Right model Dian Parkinson. ABC producers auditioned Revlon Charlie perfume model Shelley Hack and cast her as Jackson's replacement. Producers at Spelling-Goldberg were quoted as saying: \"We feel that Shelley Hack has exactly the talent, style, and intelligence we were looking for\". Producer Spelling loved the idea of the headline \"The Charlie Girl Becomes A Charlie's Angel\". Hack debuted in the fourth-season premiere as Tiffany Welles, an elegant police graduate from Boston. In hiring Hack, Spelling's priority for season four was to \"bring back the glamour\" while ABC hoped Hack's sophisticated personality would bring an interesting new mystique and intrigue to the series. However, after an initial spike in the ratings, they began to erode, so in an attempt to revitalize declining ratings and regain popularity, ABC released Hack from her contract in February 1980. A statement later issued by Spelling-Goldberg read: \"When she signed her contract for the series, Miss Hack had a personal agreement that she could review her continuation with the show at the end of her first season since series television represented an enormous change in her career and lifestyle\", implying that Hack was included in the decision to exit Charlie's Angels. In an interview with People, Hack said: \"They can say I didn't work out, but it isn't true. What happened was a network war. A business decision was made. Change the timeslot or bring on some new publicity. How to get publicity? A new Angel hunt. Who is the obvious person to replace? I am\u2014the new kid on the block\". Hack later stated: \"I never expected to be there more than a year and I wasn't. I did my year and I moved on\".Casting calls went out for Hack's replacement. After a series of false commitments, Spelling and ABC selected model and former dance instructor Tanya Roberts, beating out Jayne Kennedy, Susie Coelho, and what Roberts skeptically called \"the [other] alleged 2,000 Angel candidates\". Roberts debuted in the fifth-season premiere as Julie Rogers, a streetwise fighter and model from New York, but the season premiere episode drew mild ratings. She was pictured on the cover of People magazine and featured in an article surrounding the series. The article, titled \"Is the Jiggle Up?\", asked if Roberts could save Charlie's Angels from cancellation. Executive Brett Garwood said that they hoped to keep the show going for next year, but nothing was certain.\nBetween November 1980 and June 1981, the series was broadcast in three different time slots and its ratings further declined, so ABC cancelled the show in the spring of 1981.", "hasanswer": false}]}

While Forest of Equilibrium was firmly entrenched in a slow, heavy doom sound, elements of 1970s metal and groovier riffs entered its sound beginning with the Soul Sacrifice EP. By the time that The Ethereal Mirror was released, the band had incorporated references to 1970s music, such as the disco influences heard on \"Midnight Mountain\".As Dorrian explains, the band's original sound was a product of the immediate musical environment combined with the band members' influences:\n\nWhen we first started, the music of Cathedral was a lot more extreme than it is now, a lot more morose and depressing, because that's how we felt at the time. We'd all come out of the death metal scene, or the grindcore scene or whatever, and I was just as much into the slower stuff as I was into the faster stuff. I just wanted to do something a bit different, so we took all our influences like Vitus and Pentagram and the Obsessed and stuff and decided to take that kind of music one step further, bring it into the 90's, make it more extreme, more heavy and downtuned than any of those bands had done before. That was our first and foremost ambition, and I think we probably achieved that when we did our first album.\nBeginning with the Soul Sacrifice EP, the band began to incorporate a diverse array of 1970s influences into its sound. With 2001's Endtyme, Cathedral re-introduced the slower, doomy elements that had not been as prevalent on its previous four albums.\nThe Guessing Game represented another development in the band's sound, with Cathedral's progressive and psychedelic influences coming to the forefront.  For Dorrian, the album's direction was a result of the fact that:\n\nThis time on the record it seemed like we've come to the point where we feel confident enough to bring these influences to the fore. Because we also feel that we've got nothing to lose as well, after all this time. We've got nothing to prove as much as we've got nothing to lose. I just think we went for it, we didn't really think too hard about what the consequences would be, but I don\u2019t think we went stupidly too far into the realms of progressive rock myself, it's just the right balance between that and everything else that the band's about.\nRemarking on Cathedral's penchant for evolving its sound, Dorrian said:\n\nI just think it\u2019s important for a band like us, if we have all these influences and aspects of things we like, to be a bit more adventurous and make it interesting for ourselves as much as the audience. It might confuse a lot of people, I understand that, but that\u2019s not a deliberate intention at all. We just want to make good music to the best of our abilities. We\u2019re not the most musical band in the world, I admit that. We just want to push ourselves and stretch ourselves and contain an element of freedom of expression in our sound. I guess that\u2019s why we look back on a lot of older bands, because they were so unrestricted, and things are too restricted and categorized these days. If you think about a band like Cathedral, how would you categorize us? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what box you could put us in, and that\u2019s something I\u2019m quite happy with.
