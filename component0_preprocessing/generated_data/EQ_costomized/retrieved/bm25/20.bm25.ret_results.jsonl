As a cardinal, Sinibaldo had been on friendly terms with Frederick, even after the latter's excommunication. The Emperor greatly admired the cardinal's wisdom, having enjoyed discussions with him from time to time.\nFollowing the election, the witty Frederick remarked that he had lost the friendship of a cardinal but gained the enmity of a pope.\nHis jest notwithstanding, Frederick's letter to the new pontiff was respectful, offering congratulations to the new Pope and wishing him success. It also expressed hope for an amicable settlement of the differences between the empire and the papacy. Negotiations began shortly afterwards but were not successful. Innocent refused to back down from his demands and Frederick refused to acquiesce.  The dispute continued mostly about the restitution of Lombardy to the Patrimony of St Peter.\nThe Emperor's machinations aroused a good deal of anti-papal feelings in Italy, particularly in the Papal States, and imperial agents encouraged plots against papal rule. Realizing to be increasingly unsafe in Rome, Innocent IV secretly and hurriedly withdrew, fleeing Rome on 7 June 1244. Traveling in disguise, he made his way to Sutri and then to the port of Civitavecchia, and from there to Genoa, his birthplace, where he arrived on 7 July.

The city-state offered Jews and conversos a safe base to live and conduct business, although most practicing Jews were confined in crowded ghettos; because of this situation that Jewish people were put into, the Mendes family most likely practiced Judaism secretly while still putting up the Catholic charade. She continued the type of business that she did with her brother-in-law, and very successfully traded pepper, grain, and textiles. While in Venice, she had a dispute with her sister, Brianda, Diogo's wife, regarding his estate, and left yet again to the nearby city state of Ferrara to avoid the ruling the Venetian Giudici al Forestier (Tribunal for the Affairs of Foreigners) decided would end the sisters' conflict over equal control of the fortune.\nThe city of Ferrara was eager to accept the Mendes family; Ercole II, Duke of Este (1508-1559), agreed to the terms of Diogo Mendes's will so that the wealthy family would move to his city, and received them gracefully in 1549. In Ferrara, Beatrice Mendes, for the first time in her life, was able to openly practice Judaism in a distinguished Sephardi Jewish Community and in a city that recognized her rights. She chose the Hebrew name Nasi (her daughter's name) instead of her own Latin/Jewish name Benveniste. This time in her life is most likely when she started to become known as Do\u00f1a Gracia Nasi. The genealogy of her family starts to get a little confusing here; this is most likely when her sister Brianda adopted the name Reyna, when Beatrice's daughter Ana became known as Reyna as well, and also when Brianda's daughter, named after Beatrice, was given the name Gracia. The family's new proud Jewish identity brought Do\u00f1a Gracia beyond the realm of commercial business, and she became a large benefactor and organizer for resettling Jewish people using her commercial network during the Jewish diaspora. Do\u00f1a Gracia became very involved with the Sephardic colony in Ferrara, and became an active supporter of the burst of literacy and printing among the Jews of Ferrara. Because of her humanitarian efforts and other successes, books that were printed during this time, like the Ferrara Bible (published in 1553) and Consolation for the Tribulations of Israel (published 1553, written by Samuel Usque), were dedicated to Do\u00f1a Gracia Nasi.The move to Ferrara, however, did not end the quarrel between Do\u00f1a Gracia and her sister, Brianda (now Reyna de Luna), over control of the estate.

One of them had been hailed as heir to the throne by the grandees of the kingdom when Canute was still alive. Whether this was Eric we do not know, nor do the sources disclose the names of his three brothers. In spite of the precautions of King Canute, his sons were passed over in favour of Sverker Karlsson, the head of the rival dynasty of the Sverkers. Perhaps this was due to the influence of the mighty second-of-the-realm, Jarl Birger Brosa. As far as we know the succession took place without bloodshed.\nKing Canute's sons continued to live in the Swedish royal court and were raised by King Sverker. Several years later, after the death of Birger Brosa, the brothers and their supporters brought forward claims to the throne. King Sverker did not acquiesce, at which point Eric and his brothers escaped to Norway where they stayed over the winter of 1204\u201305. Eric and his brothers had kin ties with the Norwegian Birkebeiner party since Jarl H\u00e5kon Galen was married to their cousin, and sought their support.

His father Domenico (born in 1678) and his brothers Niccol\u00f2 and Gian Antonio were also painters, later inheriting the family workshop after the father's death in 1716. They probably all contributed as a team to some of the larger commissions later attributed to Francesco. His sister Maria Cecilia married the pre-eminent Veneto-European painter of his epoch, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.\nIn 1735, Guardi moved to the workshop of Michele Marieschi, where he remained until 1743. His first certain works are from 1738, for a parish at Vigo d'Anuania, in Trentino. In this period he worked alongside his older brother, Gian Antonio. The first work signed by Francesco is a Saint Adoring the Eucharist (c. 1739).\n\nHis works in this period included both landscapes and figure compositions. His early vedute show influence both from Canaletto and Luca Carlevarijs. On 15 February 1757, he married Maria Mattea Pagani, the daughter of painter Matteo Pagani. In 1760 his brother Gian Antonio died and his first son, Vincenzo, was born. His second son, Giacomo, was born in 1764.\nIn 1763 he worked in Murano, in the church of San Pietro Martire, finishing a Miracle of a Dominican Saint clearly influenced by Alessandro Magnasco in its quasi-expressionistic style.\nFrancesco Guardi's most important later works include the Doge's Feasts, a series of twelve canvases celebrating the ceremonies held in 1763 for the election of Doge Alvise IV Mocenigo. In his later years, Canaletto's influence on his art diminished, as shown by the Piazzetta in the Ca' d'Oro of Venice. In circa 1778, he painted the severe Holy Trinity Appearing to Sts. Peter and Paul in the parish church of Roncegno.\n\nIn 1782 Guardi was commissioned by the Venetian government six canvases to celebrate the visit of the Russian Grand Dukes to the city, of which only two remain, and two others for that of Pope Pius VI. On September 12 of that year he was admitted to the Fine Art Academy of Venice.\nA stronger attention to colours is present in late works such as the Concerto of 80 Orphans of 1782, now in Munich, in the Fa\u00e7ade of Palace with Staircase in the Accademia Carrara of Bergamo.\nGuardi died at Campiello de la Madona in Cannaregio (Venice) in 1793.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He later went to University of New Brunswick (UNB), but left without graduating. He published poetry in UNB's University Magazine.\nIn 1897 he moved to New York City, living with his brothers Charles and William and working at The Independent. In 1898 the magazine sent him to Cuba, as a special correspondent, to cover the Spanish\u2013American War.

The development process for this memorial started immediately after Abraham Lincoln's assassination and ended, appropriately enough, near the end of Reconstruction in 1876. In many ways, it exemplified and reflected the hopes, dreams, striving, and ultimate failures of reconstruction.\nThe monument has been criticized for its paternalistic character and for not doing justice to the role that African Americans played in their liberation. While the funds for the monument were raised from formerly enslaved people, a white artist conceived the original design. An alternative design depicting Lincoln with uniformed black Union soldiers was rejected as too expensive. According to historian Kirk Savage, a witness to the memorial's dedication recorded Frederick Douglass as saying that the statue \"showed the Negro on his knees when a more manly attitude would have been indicative of freedom\". In a recently uncovered letter from Douglass that appeared in the National Republican five days after the dedication, he said that the monument did not tell the \"whole truth of any subject which it might be designed to illustrate\". Douglass also says that while Lincoln breaks the enslaved person's chains in the monument, the granting of his U.S. citizenship is not represented.\nWhat I want to see before I die is a monument representing the negro, not couchant on his knees like a four-footed animal, but erect on his feet like a man. There is room in Lincoln park for another monument, and I throw out this suggestion to the end that it may be taken up and acted upon.\nJonathan White and Scott Sandage, two historians who rediscovered the letter, detailed their findings in Smithsonian Magazine in June 2020. They saw in it \"a solution to the current impasse\" over the Emancipation Memorial. Since no one statue could provide the whole truth, they suggested enriching the memorial group by adding statues of Charlotte Scott, whose contribution began the process, and Frederick Douglass, who dedicated the original monument, to create a new \"Emancipation Group\", as the monument was sometimes called. Lincoln biographer Sidney Blumenthal noted that the kneeling enslaved man was a widespread abolitionist motif, appearing on the masthead of William Lloyd Garrison's abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The band released two demo tapes, Revelation Looms in February 1996 and Blessed by the Sabbath in March 1997, which led them to gain underground metal press attention and label interest. Rise Above Records wanted to sign them, but Walker declined because he did not agree with the label's desire to change Warning's image and sound to fit the stoner rock scene.Warning debuted in 1999 with The Strength to Dream on the Miskatonic Foundation label. With this album, Warning gained a cult status within doom metal circles, but they soon disbanded after their 2001 European tour with Jack Frost.

Sluhovsky called Genevieve's cult, which lasted over 1,000 years, \"a success story\" and said, \"It was a process of expanding patronage\u2014from monastery to neighborhood, to city, to the entire kingdom. Throughout, however, the saint managed to maintain her intimate friendship with the people of Paris\". According to Shuhovsky, \"[Genevieve] became a favorite of both the humblest residents and of the Bourbon family, and was equally venerated by Erasmus and revolutionary fishwives\". Sluhovsky considers Genevieve \"a cultural symbol which Parisians shared, appropriated, negotiated, and used according to specific communal assumptions and traditions\".Complex images and attributions of Genevieve were created over a period of over 700 years, in liturgical writings, in editions of her Vita, in iconography, and in textual metaphors that were motivated by changing social, political, and religious conditions. Despite a wide variety of changes throughout the history of Paris and despite the numerous choices its residents had for possible intercessors, Genevieve was chosen as the city's patron saint. According to Sluhovsky, Genevieve successfully maintained her place in what he called \"the hierarchy of the sacred in Paris\" throughout the city's history. The placement of her shrine, for example, remained static, despite the changes that occurred throughout the city's history. Her public cult connected segments of French society and the urban and rural parts of France by bringing peasants into the city and by motivating urban residents to pray to her for successful crops and harvests outside Paris. Two churches in England, where five convents celebrated her feast, were dedicated to her during the Middle Ages, and her cult also spread to Southwest Germany.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He did the arrangements for hits by the Unifics (\"Court of Love\" and \"The Beginning of My End\") and took part in projects by the Staple Singers, Jerry Butler, Aretha Franklin, the Impressions and Curtis Mayfield himself. After becoming a \"house producer\" at Curtom, he started recording there. Hathaway recorded his first single under his own name in 1969, a duet with singer June Conquest called \"I Thank You, Baby\". They also recorded the duet \"Just Another Reason\", released as the B-side. Former Cleveland Browns president Bill Futterer, who as a college student promoted Curtom in the southeast in 1968 and 1969, was befriended by Hathaway and has cited Hathaway's influence on his later projects.\nThat year, Hathaway signed to Atco Records, then a division of Atlantic Records, after being spotted for the label by producer/musician King Curtis at a trade convention. He released his first single of note, \"The Ghetto, Pt. 1\", which he co-wrote with former Howard roommate Leroy Hutson, who became a performer, writer, and producer with Curtom. The track appeared the following year on his critically acclaimed debut LP, Everything Is Everything, which he co-produced with Ric Powell while also arranging all the cuts.\nHis second LP, Donny Hathaway, consisted mostly of covers of contemporary pop, soul, and gospel songs. His third album Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway was an album of duets with former Howard University associate and label mate Roberta Flack, for whom he previously sang backup on \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\" that established him, especially on the pop charts. The album was a critical and commercial success, including the Ralph MacDonald-penned track \"Where Is the Love\", which proved to be not only an R&B success, but also scored Top Five on the pop Hot 100. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on September 5, 1972. The album also included other covers, including versions of Carole King's \"You've Got a Friend\", \"Baby I Love You\", originally a hit for Aretha Franklin, and \"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\".\nPerhaps Hathaway's most influential recording is his 1972 album, Live, which has been termed \"one of the best live albums ever recorded\" by Daryl Easlea of the BBC. The album is on the British online music and culture magazine The Quietus' list of \"40 Favourite Live Albums\". It was recorded at two concerts: side one at the Troubadour in Hollywood, and side two at The Bitter End in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.\nHathaway was the co-composer and performer of the Christmas standard, \"This Christmas\". The song, released in 1970, has become a holiday staple and is often used in movies, television and advertising. \"This Christmas\" has been covered by numerous artists across diverse musical genres, including The Whispers, Diana Ross, Aretha Franklin, The Temptations, The Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, Alexander O'Neal, Christina Aguilera, Chicago, Harry Connick, Jr., Dru Hill, *NSYNC, Gloria Estefan, Boney James, The Cheetah Girls, Chris Brown, Anthony Arnett (First Baptist Bracktown Christmas Celebration), Patti LaBelle and Mary J. Blige (A Mary Christmas), Seal, Train and CeeLo Green, among other artists.\nHathaway followed this flurry of work with contributions to soundtracks, along with his recording of the theme song to the TV series Maude. He composed and conducted music for the 1972 soundtrack of the movie Come Back Charleston Blue. In the mid-1970s, he produced albums for other artists including Cold Blood, where he expanded the musical range of lead singer Lydia Pense.\nHis final studio album, Extension of a Man came out in 1973 with two tracks, \"Love Love Love\" and \"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know\" reaching both the pop and R&B charts. It also included his classic ballad, \"Someday We'll All Be Free\" and a six-minute symphonic-styled instrumental piece called \"I Love The Lord, He Heard My Cry\". He told UK music journalist David Nathan in 1973, \"I always liked pretty music and I've always wanted to write it.\" Added the writer, \"He declined to give one particular influence or inspiration but said that Ravel, Debussy and Stravinsky were amongst whom he studied.\"He returned to the charts in 1978 after again teaming up with Roberta Flack for a duet, \"The Closer I Get to You\" on her album, Blue Lights in the Basement. The song topped the R&B chart and reached the No. 2 spot on the Hot 100. Atlantic then put out another solo single, \"You Were Meant For Me\" shortly before his sudden death.\nLiner notes for later releases of his final solo album explain: \"Donny is no longer here, but the song \"Someday We'll All Be Free\" gathers momentum as part of his legacy... Donny literally sat in the studio and cried when he heard the playback of his final mix. It's pretty special when an artist can create something that wipes them out.\" Edward Howard, lyricist of the song, adds, \"It was a spiritual thing for me... What was going through my mind at the time was Donny, because Donny was a very troubled person. I hoped that at some point he would be released from all that he was going through.

Comic book packager Harry \"A\" Chesler's syndicate announced a Sunday and daily Nemo strip, credited to \"Winsor McCay Jr.\" Robert also drew a comic book version for Chesler called Nemo in Adventureland starring grown-up versions of Nemo and the Princess. Neither project lasted long. In 1947, Robert and fabric salesman Irving Mendelsohn organized the McCay Feature Syndicate, Inc. to revive the original Nemo strip from McCay's original art, modified to fit the size of modern newspaper pages. This revival also did not last.\n\nMcCay's original artwork has been poorly preserved. McCay insisted on having his originals returned to him, and a large collection that survived him was destroyed in a fire in the late 1930s. His wife was unsure how to handle the surviving pieces, so his son took on the responsibility and moved the collection to his own house. The family sold off some of the artwork when they were in need of cash. Responsibility for it passed to Mendelsohn, then later to daughter Marion. By the early twenty-first century, most of McCay's surviving artwork remained in family hands.McCay destroyed many of his original cans of film to create more storage space. Of what film he kept, much has not survived, as it was photographed on 35mm nitrate film, which decomposes and is highly flammable. Mendelsohn's son and a friend, both young animators, discovered the film in Mendelsohn's possession in 1947 and rescued what they could. In some cases, such as The Centaurs, only fragments could be saved. A negative and incomplete positive was discovered of Performing Animals, a film of animals playing instruments that may have been intended for McCay's vaudeville act; it was deemed unsalvageable and destroyed.In 1966, cartoonist Woody Gelman discovered the original artwork for many Little Nemo strips at a cartoon studio where McCay's son Robert had worked. Many of the recovered originals were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art under the direction of curator A. Hyatt Mayor. In 1973, Gelman published a collection of Little Nemo strips in Italy. His collection of McCay originals is preserved at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University.\nMcCay's work, grounded solidly in his understanding of realistic perspective, presaged the techniques featured in Walt Disney's feature films. Disney paid tribute to McCay in 1955 on an episode of Disneyland. The episode, \"The Story of Animated Drawing\", gave a history of animation, and dramatized McCay's vaudeville act with Gertie. Robert was invited to the Disney studios as a consultant on the episode, where Disney told him, \"Bob, all this should be your father's\".Animator and McCay biographer John Canemaker produced a film in 1974 called Remembering Winsor McCay, narrated by McCay's animation assistant John Fitzsimmons. Canemaker helped coordinate the first retrospective of McCay's films at the third International Animation Film Festival in 1975 in New York, which led to a film show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in winter 1975\u201376. Canemaker also wrote a biography in 1987 called Winsor McCay: His Life and Art. In 2005, a revised and expanded version of the biography was released, which comics scholar Jeet Heer called \"far and away the most scholarly and intelligent biography ever written about an American cartoonist\". Animation scholar Paul Wells stated, \"McCay's influence on the history of animation cannot be understated\". Film critic Richard Eder lamented that as an animation pioneer McCay was not able to reach the potential suggested by his work. Eder compared McCay to the Italian primitives of the early Renaissance, highly skilled \"in the limited techniques they could command\". Heer wrote that McCay's strength was in his visuals, but that his writing and characters were weak.\nItalian filmmaker Federico Fellini read Little Nemo in the children's magazine Il corriere dei piccoli, and the strip was a \"powerful influence\" on the filmmaker, according to Fellini biographer Peter Bondanella. Comics historian R. C. Harvey has called McCay \"the first original genius of the comic strip medium\" and in animation. Harvey said that McCay's contemporaries lacked the skill to continue with his innovations, so that they were left for future generations to rediscover and build upon.McCay's work has inspired cartoonists from Carl Barks to Art Spiegelman. Robert Crumb called McCay a \"genius\" and one of his favorite cartoonists. Art Spiegelman's 1974 \"Real Dream\" strip was partially inspired by Rarebit Fiend, and his In the Shadow of No Towers in 2004 appropriated some of McCay's imagery, and included a page of Little Nemo in its appendix. Maurice Sendak's children's book In the Night Kitchen (1970) was an homage to McCay's work, as was Rick Veitch' comic book series Roarin' Rick's Rarebit Fiends (1994\u201396). Kim Deitch and Simon Deitch's graphic novel The Boulevard of Broken Dreams revolved around a character named Winsor Newton, based on an aged McCay. Cartoonist Berke Breathed lamented that the conditions of newspaper cartooning had devolved to such a degree since McCay's time that, had he worked later in the century, he would not have been allotted space sufficient for his expansive full-page fantasies.\nAs Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams first appeared in print in 1899, McCay's major dream strips work have invited speculation of a Freudian influence. But it can be proved that McCay's influence, at least in a secondhand manner, reached Freud: Hungarian artist N\u00e1ndor Honti, heavily inspired by McCay's Rarebit Fiend, which he had seen when he lived in the United States from 1903 to about 1907, created a comic page titled \"A Francia Bonne \u00c1lma\" (\"A French Nanny's Dream\", often called \"A French Nurse's Dream,\" 1911), which was passed to Sigmund Freud by the Hungarian psychoanalyst S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi. Freud then included the comic in the 1914 edition of his book. Honti's comic strongly resembles the work of McCay in its theme, pacing, Art Nouveau style, and closing panel of the dreamer awakening in bed.\nThe Winsor McCay Award was established in 1972 to recognize individuals for lifetime or career contributions in animation, and is presented as part of the Annie Awards. The Hammer Museum in Los Angeles devoted a room to McCay's work as part of the Masters of American Comics exhibit in 2005. German publisher Taschen published a complete, boxed, full-size edition of Little Nemo in two volumes in 2014 entitled The Complete Little Nemo.The American astronomer Roy A. Tucker named the asteroid 113461 after McCay in 2002.Despite dispute over his birthplace, a public park and historical marker honor McCay in Spring Lake, Michigan. The marker, unveiled in 2009, is located in Winsor McCay Park. Winsor McCay Park is the modern-day location of where Union School once stood, wherein McCay \"illustrated his first 'commercial' for-sale illustration\" in 1880. Developers have been working since 2009 to develop the park into a more sophisticated memorial to McCay including \"a large Gertie the Dinosaur statue at the entrance of the park...a bronze statue of Winsor McCay that will be placed next to the historical marker/sign [and] Gertie the Dinosaur stepping-stone footprints [that] will meander through the park, leading back to a scaled-down replica of Union School.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1898 the magazine sent him to Cuba, as a special correspondent, to cover the Spanish\u2013American War. While on the island he contracted malaria\u2014he was sent back to New York and consulted specialists, who sent him back to Fredericton \"to die.\"An unnamed surgeon saved Roberts's life, and he was nursed back to heath by Frances Seymour Allen (whom he would subsequently marry). The next year he travelled to Newfoundland, where he helped to found and edit The Newfoundland Magazine. He published his first book of poetry Northand Lyrics, an anthology edited by Charles G.D. Roberts and featuring his three siblings in 1899, and his first novel, The House of Isstens, in 1900.\nIn 1901 Roberts sailed on a barkentine to Brazil. In 1902 he returned to Fredericton and briefly edited a second magazine, The Kit-Bag.Roberts married Frances Seymour Allen in November 1903, and they had a two-year honeymoon in Barbados where their first child was born. They would have four children: William Goodridge, Dorothy Mary Gostwick, Theodora Frances Bliss and Loveday (who died as an infant).Roberts averaged three novels a year from 1908 until 1914. At that time his \"many novels of adventure and romance\" already enjoyed a \"wide popularity in English-speaking lands.\"A former militiaman, Roberts re-enlisted in 1914 when World War I broke out, serving as a lieutenant in the 12th Canadian Infantry Battalion, commanded by Lt.-Col. Harry Fulton McLeod of Fredericton\u2014Roberts' entire family followed him to England. When the 12th Battalion was assigned to a reserve and training roll in early 1915, Roberts was transferred to a position perhaps better fitted to his combination of military knowledge and literary skill. \"In the summer of 1915, he was transferred to the Canadian War Records Office at the request of Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook. Roberts wrote official reports and battlefield accounts and published three works in collaboration with others.\" He was promoted captain early in 1916.\nWhen Roberts was in Europe he left his manuscripts and papers, including work not yet published, with a Dr. Wainwright in Saint John, who stored them in his basement. They were destroyed in the spring of 1919 when the Saint John River flooded.In 1929 Roberts wrote a weekly column for the Saint John Telegraph-Journal, \"Under the Sun.\" From April through September 1930 he edited another small magazine, Acadie.In 1932 he undertook his last major sea cruise, sailing through the Panama Canal to Vancouver and back. The same year he did a cross-Canada reading tour, which \"culminated with festivities in Vancouver.\"Roberts moved to Toronto in 1935, and in 1937 briefly edited another magazine, Spotlight. In 1939 he relocated to Aylmer, Quebec, where he briefly founded another magazine, Swizzles.He returned to New Brunswick in 1941, and in 1945 moved to Digby, Nova Scotia, where he would die eight years later.

Alfred served as a US Consul after being recommended by Balie Peyton, US Ambassador to Chile under President Zachary Taylor. Her father died in 1867 and her mother moved the family to London, where Virginia became a naturalized British citizen in 1873. Around that time Amy displayed a skill for composition and became a student of Carl Schloesser and Amy Horrocks. Her early work, published as Amy Ward, though promising, was received only tepidly.\nAt the age of 34, she married Brigade-Surgeon Woodforde-Finden, who served during the Second Afghan War and Third Burmese War with the Bengal establishment of the Indian Medical Service; they lived in India for several years, and during her time there she wrote and published what would become her most famous pieces: The Lover in Damascus and Kashmiri Song. The latter was originally self-published in 1902 but because of its popularity and the influence of Hamilton Earle, it was eventually published by Boosey & Co. The popularity of Kashmiri Song and The Lover in Damascus kept her in the good graces of her publishing house and in the hearts of her audience. Her songs are noted for their sentimentality, their romantic fluidity and how they blend a particularly British, middle-class sensibility with an Asian pastiche. In the years that followed the success of Kashmiri Song, she composed On Jhelum River, The Pagoda of Flowers and Stars of the Desert.\nThe year 1916 was a bitter-sweet one for Woodforde-Finden: she lost her husband in April, and her work was featured in the film Less Than the Dust. This was just the first of her work to be showcased in film. In 1943, Kashmiri Song would be used in the film Hers To Hold. She moved back to London after she lost her husband, and survived him by only three years, dying on 13 March 1919. It is said that she died composing at the piano. Amy is buried in Hampsthwaite churchyard in North Yorkshire, and her memorial is a recumbent figure in white marble.\nThe legacy Amy Woodforde-Finden leaves is one of bridging cultures with music and words. She interpreted the sounds and motives of Asian-South Asian music to an American-European audience and transported the listener to a world of romance and the exotic.\nThe German composer and pianist Thomas Flessenkaemper founded 2022 the Amy Woodforde-Finden Music Festival at St Thomas \u00e0 Becket Church in Hampsthwaite.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Alexander served as a liaison between Petersburg-based Thon and Moscow crews, acquiring his first practical experience.\nIn 1857, Kaminsky won a state-paid postgraduate tour of Europe, and travelled extensively until 1861. In Paris, he met Pavel Tretyakov, a young member of an influential Muscovite business family and an art collector. Back in Moscow, friendship with Tretyakovs resulted in his first independent commissions. Next year, Alexander married Sophia, sister of Pavel Tretyakov; he remained Tretyakov's house architect until the end of his career.\nSince 1867, Kaminsky was also a house architect for Moscow Merchant Society, an ambitious real estate consortium that redeveloped territories of Kitai-Gorod, Neglinnaya Street. His best known jobs for the Merchant Society were its own Neglinnaya Street offices and rebuilding the Exchange Building in Ilyinka Street. Rebuilding of historical buildings became a common work for Kaminsky, but he also built traditional, spacious town estates (Chetverikov Estate in Kolpachny Lane, Karatayeva-Morozova Estate in Leontyevsky Lane, etc.) and public buildings. Kaminsky was a true and accomplished eclecticist, never leaning to a particular style. Like Thon, he picked styling depending on the building functions and the client's budget.\nFor about thirty years, Kaminsky was teaching at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture and training its graduates within his firm (his alumni include Fyodor Schechtel, Ivan Mashkov, Ilya Bondarenko, Max Hoeppener).\nArchitect's career was cut short in 1888 when a Kuznetsky Most building, erected by his firm, collapsed.

On 7 April 1766, Graff arrived in Dresden where he was appointed court painter and teacher for portrait painting at the Dresden Art Academy, a post he kept for life although he got better paid offers at other academies, among others in Berlin. In early 1788, the Prussian Minister Friedrich Anton von Heynitz made Graff the financially very attractive offer to work for the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. On 7 May 1789, Graff informed Count Camillo Marcolini, general director of the Dresden Art Academy, about this. Marcolini reacted straight away. On 20 June 1789, Graff was appointed Professor for portrait painting at the Dresden Art Academy.Graff made portraits of nearly 1,000 of his contemporaries and was the leading portrait painter in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th century. Graff was also the main portrait painter of German poets between the Enlightenment and the early Romantic periods. Many of them were also his friends, like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe whom he met in Dresden in 1768. Graff was the favourite portrait painter of the German, Russian, Polish and Baltic nobility. Among others he portrayed Stanislaw Kostka Potocki. His most important clients included Catherine the Great of Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia. His portrait of Frederick the Great is regarded as his masterpiece. The painting is exhibited at Schloss Charlottenburg. Frederick the Great never posed for Graff. However, Graff received authorization to watch Frederick at a military parade in 1781. This gave Graff the chance to study the physiognomy of the King, and was therefore the basis for his portrait.Graff was also very popular with the landed gentry, diplomats, musicians and scholars. He portrayed many of them. While painting a portrait, Graff always focused the light on the person's face. In Graff's portraits it was always the face that got the attention and the light, except when the sitter was a lady. In that case he also focused on the lady's d\u00e9collet\u00e9. Graff was a master of light and shadow. His role model in this context was J\u00e1n Kupeck\u00fd whose works he studied in the collections of Ansbach. In comparison with the calmness of the ladies the gentlemen in his portraits often appear serious and reserved.\nHe also knew how to paint dresses and draperies of different materials and colours in a natural way. His role model in this field was the French court painter Hyacinthe Rigaud. In 1765/66 Graff portrayed Elisabeth Sulzer in a blue silk dress with silver laces and fur collar and borders.\nIn his early years, Graff did hardly ever paint any background details in his portraits. He usually kept the background monochrome. However, in his later years he also paid more attention to the background. Usually he painted the sitter in outdoor surroundings, as was the fashion at that time in England. The price for a portrait by Graff was calculated by size and details of the sitter's clothes. That it was not always easy for Graff to portrait the famous of the time shows the remark he made while painting Friedrich Schiller: \"He cannot sit still.\" Graff was much in demand. He could live a comfortable life with his income.\nIn 1769 Graff met Philipp Erasmus Reich, a well known bookseller and publisher in Leipzig. Reich became a good friend of Graff. He engaged him to portrait his scholar friends. In September 1771, Graff travelled to Berlin and portrayed Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in Johann Georg Sulzer's apartment. Lessing's comment on his portrait was: \"Do I really look that terribly nice?\" In Berlin Graff also portrayed Moses Mendelssohn and Johann Georg Sulzer, his future father-in-law.\nIn his later years Graff turned to painting landscapes and developed further a sparkling manner of painting that anticipated Impressionism. Philipp Otto Runge and Caspar David Friedrich were influenced by his work.\nGraff was a sociable person. He cultivated friendships with many of his sitters, business partners and colleagues such as the Polish engraver Daniel Chodowiecki, the Swiss painters Salomon Gessner and Adrian Zingg and the Saxon engraver Johann Friedrich Bause. Bause reproduced many of Graff's portraits as engravings. This made Graff's name and his artworks also well known within the general public.\nGraff travelled quite often to Berlin. His father-in-law, Johann Georg Sulzer, introduced him to members of the Prussian court. He became very popular with the Prussian nobility and they were good customers of him. He never forgot how well he was received within the Prussian society. In 1778 he closed the short autobiography with the sentence: \"Berlin habe ich viel zu verdanken\" (I owe Berlin much).On 16 October 1771, Anton Graff married Elisabetha Sophie Augusta Sulzer, called \"Guste\". Graff and his wife had 5 children. The first daughter, Johanna Catharina Henrietta, died the same year she was born in 1772. Another daughter was born in 1779 and died only a few months later. His second son, Georg, died in 1801. In 1803 Graff underwent cataract surgery. His wife Elisabeth died in 1812. Graff himself died of typhoid fever in the evening of 22 June 1813, at around 8pm in Dresden. He was 76 years old. He left his two surviving children, Caroline Susanne (she married the painter Karl Ludwig Kaaz, a pupil of Graff) and Carl Anton (he became a landscapist), a fortune of 40,000 Thaler. Graff was buried in Dresden. His tomb does not exist anymore.\nGraff was a prolific artist. He painted some 2,000 paintings and drawings. His paintings, especially the portraits, are much sought-after. Many of them are in museums and private collections in Switzerland (Museum Oskar Reinhart), Germany (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden), Russia (Hermitage Museum), Estonia (Kadriorg Palace, Tallinn) and Poland (National Museum, Warsaw). The portraits of gentlemen outnumber the portraits of ladies.\nIn honour of their famous citizen the Berufsbildungsschule Winterthur (BBW) (School for Vocational Training) named their building after Graff. The \"Anton-Graff-Haus\".In Winterthur and Dresden there are streets named after Anton Graff.\n2013 jubilee exhibitions take place in the Museum Oskar Reinhart, Winterthur, and in the Old National Gallery in Berlin.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "20_105", "question": "Where did Sam Haskins die?", "ctxs": [{"id": "20_19695", "text": "Haskins started his career as an advertising photographer in Johannesburg in 1953. He ran what was probably the first modern freelance advertising studio in Africa. He produced commercial work across a very broad spectrum of photography from still life to industrial, fashion and aerial. His first formal creative output was a one-man show at the popular Johannesburg department store John Orrs in 1960. This featured black-and-white photography of models in the studio and included some photographs of dolls made by the young Elisabeth Langsch, who went on to become Switzerland's leading ceramist.\nHis international reputation and his signature photographic passions were established by four key books published in the 1960s. Five Girls (1962) explored a fresh approach to photographing the nude female figure and contained important first explorations with black-and-white printing, cropping and book design, which were a key feature of his subsequent books. Cowboy Kate & Other Stories (1964) was probably the first book to deliberately explore black-and-white photographic grain as a medium for expression and image design. It was highly influential at the time, sold roughly a million copies worldwide and won the Prix Nadar in France in 1964. It continues to influence contemporary photographers, film makers, fashion designers and make-up artists. Cowboy Kate & Other Stories or 'Kate' as the book is often referred to, had its place in photographic history cemented in 2005 when the International Center of Photography in New York included the book in their exhibition The Open Book: A History of the Photographic Book from 1878 to the Present.\nNovember Girl (1967) contained key image collages which formed the basis of many graphic and surrealist experiments in the 1970s and 1980s. African Image (1967) was a visual homage to the indigenous people, culture, landscape and wildlife of sub-Saharan Africa. The images represent a lifelong interest in photographing graphically stimulating environments and formally document his passion for indigenous craft. He broke bones on river rapids and wrote off two Volvo saloon cars on African dirt roads while shooting the book. Despite its international award, this meticulously constructed book, celebrating a love for sub-Saharan Africa, is probably the least known of his major creative projects, but it is coveted by serious collectors of African art and photography.\nIn 1968, Haskins moved to London and ran a studio in Glebe Place just off the King's Road. He worked as an advertising photographer for international consumer brands Asahi Pentax, Bacardi, Cutty Sark whisky, Honda, BMW, Haig whisky, DeBeers, British Airways, Unilever and Zanders, and specialised in the art direction and shooting of calendars, especially for Asahi Pentax in Japan. Although he endorsed Hasselblad for a short period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his loyalty to the medium format 6x7 camera and lenses from Asahi resulted in a rare long-term association between a camera manufacturer and photographer. From 1970 to 2000, Asahi Optical (later Pentax) produced 30 calendars, of which Haskins shot and art-directed 15 editions including the millennium calendar. No other photographer was invited to contribute more than once. He is still involved with the Pentax Forum Gallery in Tokyo, which hosts his exhibitions. His first contact came in 1967, when Asahi Optical presented him with a 35 mm camera after hearing that he had shot African Image with various competitors' products.\nIn 1972, he produced his first colour book, Haskins Posters. The large-format publication contained pages printed on one side using a thick stiff paper and a soft glue perfect binding allowing the pages to be removed and used as posters. Haskins and Alida successfully published the book internationally through their own company, Haskins Press. The book won a gold award at the New York One Show. At the time the best-known image from Haskins Posters, a girl's face superimposed on an apple with a bee near the stem, appeared on the cover or in editorials of almost every major photographic magazine around the world. This image was part of a well-publicised visual and graphic experimentation with the apple theme in the 1970s that for a while resulted in photographic journalists nicknaming him 'Sam the Apple man'.\nThe images in Haskins Posters traversed different creative themes that all became signature passions for Haskins' image-making over the next three decades; graphically strong compositions of nudes characterised by a natural essence in the models, while the image-making explored themes of graphic experimentation, humour and sensual eroticism. Haskins had a recurring theme (rooted in his training as a painter) of creating tension in the surface of his photographs between flat graphic elements and 3D chiaroscuro. Those results were often achieved with sophisticated lighting and/or double exposures. A highly creative and design driven approach to lighting almost always played a key role in Haskins' work, both in the studio and on location. He often developed complex lighting designs for a single specific shot that were never repeated, a late example being a fashion shoot for New York magazine's 75th anniversary issue shot in New York's Pier 57 studios in August 2006.Haskins also often sculpted and painted graphic elements for his photographs and drew inspiration from a combination of surrealism, illustration, film and modern graphic designers.\nThe graphic experiments first seen in Haskins Posters and related exhibitions at London's Photographer's Gallery and National Theatre, resulted in a book called Photo Graphics (1980). The title of the book coined a new term in photography that has since become widely used.\nHaskins' next book, Sam Haskins \u00e1 Bologna (1984), resulted from an invitation by the mayor of Bologna to photograph the city. The publication was accompanied by an exhibition in the city. This project led to two more homages to visually rich locations shot over a series of visits; Barcelona (1991) and Kashmir (between 1992 and 1994).\nFrom 2000 to 2005, he focused on fashion photography for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Allure and New York. A shortage of copies of the original edition of Cowboy Kate & Other Stories (1964), which was selling to collectors for up to US$3,000, led Haskins to bring out a digitally remastered 'director's cut' version in October 2006, published by Rizzoli in New York. Apart from image editing and layout revisions, the new version had 16 pages of new images.\nIn 2002, Haskins and Alida moved to the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, Australia, and built the third house-studio of their partnership. The move away from London resulted in a renaissance in Haskins' fashion photography. While he had always had a passion for fashion from the start of his career, and Cowboy Kate influenced fashion designers, who credited Haskins, he had not been courted by the mainstream fashion world and did not court them. A shoot for Yves Saint Laurent in Paris in 2002 resulted in a 'rediscovery' that led to a stream of assignments in London, New York, Paris, Tokyo and Sydney, working for fashion houses and magazines.\nIn December 2006, a month after his 80th birthday, the first retrospective exhibition of his work (with a portraiture bias) opened at the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra (Australia). That was also his first exhibition at a national museum/gallery. The show ran for four and a half months to 22 April 2007.\nThe exhibition contained several portraits of other artists never seen before, including one of the late Jean-Michel Folon, a graphic artist much admired by Haskins. Although one or two of the images from that personal portrait project had previously been published, the majority remained part of a quiet collection built up over decades of meeting and befriending other artists.\nIn 2009, Haskins published, under the family imprint The Haskins Press, his first book in 24 years. Fashion Etcetera is a thematic slice through his archive that explores a lifelong passion for fashion, style and design. The book was produced over three years working in close collaboration with his son Ludwig and his grandson Oren, and is dedicated to Ludwig and Oren. In 2009, the last year of Haskins' life, his \"Fashion Etcetera\" book and exhibition received widespread global publicity, and in the process, turned images of Gill from 'Five Girls' (1962) into one of the new-found icons of the 1960s. Following the death of Haskins' wife, Alida Haskins, on 5 December 2012, the Haskins estate is now 100% owned and managed by Ludwig, who continues to publish and exhibit his father's work and negotiate image rights.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Relating to the years 1921\u201323 in which Lauge Koch conducted the Bicentenary Jubilee Expedition to North Greenland in the year of the bicentennial jubilee of Hans Egede's landing in Greenland, Koch made a sledge journey along the north coast of Greenland, round Peary Land and back across the Inland Ice. On this journey Koch discovered a depression which in his opinion was the one that Robert Peary in 1892 had mistaken for a channel \u2014the so-called \"Peary Channel\". Koch's observations of the interior of Independence Fjord led to considerable cartographic changes compared with the Peter Freuchen map of 1912.In 1922 he mapped Hiawatha Glacier, and noted that the glacier tongue extended into Lake Alida (near Foulk Fjord).In 1938, Lauge Koch found in the mountains west of Jameson Land, near Scoresby Sound, the skeleton of a huge extinct mammal similar to the head of a gigantic animal with huge teeth found by Professor Selim Hassan in 1935 near the pyramid of Chephren. The skeleton found by Koch was displayed at the museum in Copenhagen.Amongst his other contributions to the sciences, in the mid-1930s Koch established a network of field stations and traveling huts in Central East Greenland. This establishment of a permanent infrastructure in the field caused a change in the whole culture and organization of Danish Arctic exploration.His last expedition was the 1956-58 Expedition to East Greenland in which he used helicopters.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Wilmington Quicksteps, Kansas City Cowboys, Philadelphia Quakers, Chicago White Stockings, Chicago Pirates, Cincinnati Kelly's Killers, and Philadelphia Phillies.\nDebuting with the Wilmington Quicksteps in 1884, Bastian played just 17 games before moving on to Union Association rival Kansas City Cowboys, where he tallied another eleven. After the demise of the UA, Bastian signed with the Philadelphia Quakers of the National League. He became the club's everyday shortstop, playing 103 games but hitting only .167 with 4 home runs and 29 RBI. He also led the league in strikeouts with 82. Despite this, in 1886, Bastian became the regular second baseman for the Quakers. His production increased a bit as he hit .217 with 2 home runs and 38 RBI, and he placed in the league's top ten in triples. However, as his offense was still subpar, Bastian lost his starting job for 1887, remaining with the team as a utility infielder that season and the next.\nThe Chicago White Stockings (predecessors of the Cubs) were Bastian's next stop, as they purchased him from Philadelphia. With the Cubs, Bastian's performance bottomed out. He batted a career-low .135 and played in just 46 games. Bastian jumped to the fledgling Players' League in 1890, signing with the Chicago Pirates, where he was once again an everyday shortstop. However, his lack of offensive production continued to plague him, as Bastian failed to hit .200 for a third consecutive season.\nBastian played a game each for the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers and his old Philadelphia Quakers, now the Philadelphia Phillies, in 1891 before hanging up his glove after his final appearance on August 22.

After the mobster is killed by his own wife; she is then killed by their son, Tony Gallo, who appears to be under the influence of the rock. As time passes; Gallo grows up into a vile, contemptible person. The rock itself, narrating, makes a point that it cannot exist without \"him\".\nIn present-day Metropolis, Superman fights the Royal Flush Gang on a tanker. He thinks about how the city sees him as a symbol of hope just as much as he hopes he does not screw up just as the gang causes the tanker to explode. Because Superman is not hurt, he wonders if he will ever feel pain. Later, Superman and Lois Lane share a meal on the Eiffel Tower, pointing out that he hates not spending enough time with the perfect woman. The next day, Perry White meets with Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen; after starting dramatic, assigns to the team their next story: the new Metropolis casino from Tony Gallo that might be an illegal front. After setting up their undercover location to set up a sting; Lois calls Gallo, who decides to talk to her after realizing who she is. Gallo sets up dinner with Lois, thinking the article is of a positive nature, but because Lois has an engagement with Superman, asks to be set up for tomorrow. Clark, listening, is happy and goes on patrol that night before seeing Lois, where he finds a village in danger from a volcano. He goes to subdue the volcano by going below, but Superman almost drowns in the lava and misses the date with Lois as she is now being taken by Gallo. A scared Superman goes to see Ma and Pa Kent and after telling them the story, Pa asks Clark to come to him if it happens again, as Ma can get easily scared. Gallo returns Lois home, having a great time, and just as Gallo leaves, Lois sees Superman.\nLois and Superman talk at her apartment, where she reveals that she met a perfect man but, because he is committed to the world, does not think a relationship could work and thus leaves him. Ace, the android member of the Royal Flush Gang, meets with Lex Luthor to discuss the fight; the point of the attack was to see what could harm Superman. Luthor gets an idea when he hears Superman caring for the people around him and tells the android and the Gang to leave Metropolis. After Superman talks to a polar bear close to the Fortress of Solitude over his problems, he returns home, giving a huge cake for \"Fun Day\" where Luthor is giving a presentation and Lois hands Superman a card from Gallo; he asks Superman to pick up a check from the first six months of profits to be sent for pediatric care. He reads that toward the audience, but heads out when an explosion occurs at the casino. Just as Gallo stands naked toward the green glow from the rock, Superman begins to fall, losing his ability to fly, into the crater made from the explosion. Luthor watches his men beat Superman up, but cannot believe what they are using is that effective. Once Gallo closes the door from the rock, Superman becomes healthy again and defeats the men, before passing out. Jimmy comes over and helps him out by taking him to Clark's (to which Clark answers, as it is a robot Superman built). Lois goes to see Jimmy at the hideout, but he is not there and finds Luthor instead, who shows her images that prove Superman can be hurt. Mr. Ogilvy, from the Daily Planet, is a double agent as he reveals to Gallo what the reporters have been doing.\nLois asks Gallo about himself and Gallo wants to tell her a \"fantastic\" story. Lex finds out that Gallo has a rock of alien origin inside his building just as Superman goes back to Smallville to meet with his parents. Talking to both of them in the barn; Clark tells them about what happened and thinks he can be killed. Lois calls Jimmy to come over to the Casino, as Luthor plots his invasion on Gallo's casino. As promised at \"Fun Day\", Superman arrives at the casino, where Gallo meets with him with Lois and Jimmy behind him and reveals who he really is. Tony Gallo is not Tony Gallo at all; but a physical embodiment of kryptonite that came to Earth the same time Superman did. Gallo wants to show Superman his origins by going inside the kryptonite room, but its effects might kill him: Superman agrees anyway. Inside, Superman falls in pain and the rock takes an anthropomorphic form, just as Luthor arrives and insists on keeping the door opened. Just as they scan Superman and kryptonite, Gallo awakens and snaps, screaming to kill them all. Superman and the kryptonite are on Krypton at a time before it exploded; he sees Jor-El and Lara and sees himself as a baby. Gallo, driven mad, kills himself after thinking Lois is his mother. Luthor prepares to kill Lois and Jimmy, but Jimmy threatens him instead. Just as Krypton explodes, Superman sees how he escaped and is in tears when he sees Jor-El and Lara die, completing his origin. Luthor leaves, but is happy that he got a piece of the rock, just as Superman awakens to a relieved Lois and Jimmy.\nDoing what the kryptonite asked for, Superman sends the rock into the sun and recounts the story to his Ma and Pa.

Within twenty years his style was considered hopelessly outdated and owners of his works sought to eradicate all traces of his efforts. From the 1890s to the later twentieth century, Victorian art was under constant assault, critics writing of \"the nineteenth century architectural tragedy\", ridiculing \"the uncompromising ugliness\" of the era's buildings and attacking the \"sadistic hatred of beauty\" of its architects.  Of Burges, they wrote almost nothing. His buildings were disregarded or altered, his jewellery and stained glass were lost or ignored, and his furniture was given away.\nThe architectural historian Megan Aldrich writes, \"He founded no school ... had few adherents outside the circle of his practice ... and trained no further generation of designers.\" In comparison with more prolific contemporaries, he completed relatively few works and lost many architectural competitions. Burges's collaborator, the artist Nathaniel Westlake, lamented \"competitions are seldom given to the best man \u2013 look at the number poor Burges won, or should have won, and I think he executed only one.\" Burges occasionally acted as a judge in architectural competitions and Eastlake also commented on Burges's failure to win them; \"in one case only has he traversed this always arduous road to fame with anything like substantial success.\"\nAlmost his sole champion in the years after his death was his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death. Burges also received brief, but largely favourable, attention in Muthesius's Das englische Haus, where Muthesius described him as \"the most talented Gothicist of his day\".From the later twentieth century to the present a renaissance has occurred in the study of Victorian art, architecture and design and Crook contends that Burges's place at the centre of that world, as \"a wide-ranging scholar, an intrepid traveller, a coruscating lecturer, a brilliant decorative designer and an architect of genius,\" is again appreciated. Crook writes further that, in a career of only some twenty years, he became \"the most brilliant architect-designer of his generation,\" and, beyond architecture, his achievements in metalwork, jewellery, furniture and stained glass place him as Pugin's only \"rival [.] as the greatest art-architect of the Gothic Revival.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Among the important international venues at which he sang were La Scala, Milan, (in 1923-26) and the New York Metropolitan Opera (in 1923-25). Additionally, in 1926, he had the honour of creating the role of Calaf in Puccini's posthumously-premiered final opera, Turandot, at the insistence of La Scala's principal conductor, Arturo Toscanini. But this taxing dramatic role took him to the limit of his resources and he did not attempt it again.\nFleta made his operatic debut in Trieste in 1919, having previously studied voice at the Madrid conservatory. Successful engagements in Rome followed, leading to his La Scala and Met debuts. He quit the Met in acrimonious circumstances, however, and the resultant legal action stopped him performing again in the United States.\nHe was celebrated during his best years for the finesse with which he used his rich, flexible voice. The most notable aspect of his performance style was the nimbleness of his bel canto technique. This enabled him to produce spectacular messa di voce and pianissimo effects. Unfortunately, Fleta's singing became increasingly self-indulgent as his career progressed. By the late 1920s, as recordings show, his voice had deteriorated badly, with his vibrato loosening to an undesirable extent.\nFleta died in straitened circumstances in 1938. He nonetheless left a legacy of sometimes fascinating records, many of which are available on CD reissues.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The catheter is used to monitor heart conditions, especially in intensive care units.  Ganz was also one of the first cardiologists to use enzymes to open clogged arteries, which can lead to heart attacks.Ganz was born in Kosice, Czechoslovakia, located in modern-day Slovakia, in 1919. He enrolled at the Charles University School of Medicine in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1938. The school was closed in 1940 following the start of Nazi Germany's occupation Czechoslovakia.  Ganz, who was Jewish, was sent to a Nazi labor camp in Hungary during World War II. He was scheduled to be sent to Auschwitz in 1944, but escaped and went into hiding. After World War II, Ganz graduated from Charles University in 1947 at the top of his class.Ganz worked in Czechoslovakia, which was under Communist rule at the time.  In 1966, Ganz was permitted to take his wife, Magda, and the couple's two sons on a vacation to Italy. Instead, the family went to Vienna, Austria, where they applied for a visa to the United States. He had relatives in Los Angeles, which allowed the family to move to the United States.  Ganz gained a position at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he remained for the rest of his career.Ganz and Dr. Jeremy Swan first developed the idea for the pulmonary artery catheter in 1970.  A balloon is placed at the end of a flexible catheter, which is inserted into the pulmonary artery.  Additionally, Ganz had a role in the development of thrombolysis, in which enzymes break down blood clots.Ganz died of natural causes on November 11, 2009, at the age of 90.  He was survived by his sons, Dr. Peter Ganz, a cardiologist at UCSF, and Dr. Tomas Ganz, a pulmonologist at UCLA.  His wife, Magda Ganz, died in 2005.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

Author Ian Fleming had placed Bond in a DB Mark III in the novel, but Stears persuaded the company to make its DB5 prototype available.There were a total of four Goldfinger DB5s. Two of these were used in filming and two were used only for promotional purposes. The first filming car, DP/2161/1, was fitted with gadgets. This DB5 was the original prototype and was painted Dubonnet Red. Before it appeared in Goldfinger, it was used in episode 2.17, \"The Noble Sportsman,\" of The Saint. This car, chassis number DP/216/1, was later stripped of its weaponry and gadgetry by Aston Martin and resold. It was retrofitted by subsequent owners with non-original weaponry and later appeared in the film The Cannonball Run (1981), in which it was driven by Roger Moore. Chassis DP/216/1 DB5 was stolen in 1997 from its last owner in Florida and was reported to be still missing in 2021. The second filming car, DB5/1486/R, was used for driving scenes and had no gadgets. After filming, gadgets were added and the car was used for promotion. It featured the pop-out gun barrels behind the front indicators, the bullet shield behind the rear window and a three-way revolving front number plate showing \"LU 6789\" or \"4711-EA-62\" or \"BMT 216A.\" In 2010, RM Auctions sold this car for $4.6 million to Harry Yeaggy. The first publicity car, DB5/2017/R, was acquired by the Louwman Museum in The Hague. The second publicity car, DB5/2008/R, was auctioned by RM Sotheby's in August 2019 for $6.4 million to an unknown buyer. These two cars were displayed at the 1964 New York World's Fair to promote the film. Sales of the DB5 increased after it was described as \"the most famous car in the world\".After Goldfinger, the Aston Martin DB5 became closely associated with the James Bond franchise. The same car (registration BMT 216A) was used again in the next film, Thunderball, a year later. The DB5 is considered to be the quintessential vehicle associated with the Bond character and it has reappeared in subsequent Bond films. \n\nA different DB5 (registration BMT 214A) was used in the 1995 Bond film GoldenEye, in which the car was Bond's personal vehicle and had no gadgets - although it did come equipped with a champagne cooler in the arm rest and a fax machine. Three different DB5s were used for filming. This same car briefly reappeared in the next film, Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). It was set to make a cameo appearance in the Scotland-set scenes in The World Is Not Enough (1999), but most of these scenes were cut in the final edit. Another DB5 (registration 56526) appeared in Casino Royale (2006), this time owned by the villain, Alex Dimitrios. This car had Bahamian number plates and left-hand drive (where the previous British versions had been right-hand drive). In the film, Bond wins the car from Dimitrios after beating him in a card game.\nThe Goldeneye DB5 was put on display at the London Film Museum in Covent Garden. Of the three cars used in the production, one car, DB5/2187/R, was filmed for the static ocean-side shot. A second car, DB5/1885/R, was driven in the chase scene against a Ferrari in Monte Carlo. This car was sold at a Christie's auction in 2001 and entered the Guinness Book of Records that year after receiving the highest price paid for an item of Bond memorabilia. It appeared in the Bond exhibition at Beaulieu before moving to a new home in the London Film Museum. The third car, chassis number DB5/1484/R, was retained by the movie production company, Eon Productions, and appeared in later Bond movies.\nAnother silver-birch DB5 with the original registration BMT 216A was used in the 23rd James Bond film, Skyfall, which coincided with the 50th anniversary of the release of the first Bond film, Dr. No, in 1962. The car is destroyed in the film's climactic finale. Two cars were used during filming: DB5/1484/R (first seen in GoldenEye) and a second car, DB5/2007/R. It is seen again in Spectre (2015), firstly in Q's underground workshop in various stages of rebuild, and at the film's ending, fully rebuilt, with Bond driving it away.\nIn 2019, Aston Martin confirmed that the car would be featured in the next Bond film, No Time to Die, to be released in October 2021. The plan was to build replicas and not use  existing vehicles. Eight replica DB5 stunt cars were built for the movie. The DB5 seen in a high-speed chase at the start of the film was sold for \u00a32.92 million at a charity auction in London in 2022.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1837, however, just younger than 21 and having imbibed from Robinson Crusoe a taste for adventure, he went to America and wandered over a large part of the United States, supporting himself by whatever work came to hand.\nHe became fireman on a steamboat, deck hand, farmer, silversmith, and merchant. After wandering through most of the United States, spending some time as a hunter and trapper in the Indian territory, and in 1842 keeping a hotel at Point Coup\u00e9e, Louisiana, he returned to Germany six adventurous years later in 1843.To his great surprise, he found himself famous as an author. His mother had shown his diary, which he regularly sent home, and which contained descriptions of his adventures in the New World, to the editor of the Rosen, who published them in that periodical. These sketches having found favour with the public, Gerst\u00e4cker issued them in 1844 under the title Streif- und Jagdz\u00fcge durch die Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika. In 1845 his first novel, Die Regulatoren in Arkansas, appeared marking the start of a successful writing career.

On his return to Germany, he settled in Leipzig.\nIn 1860 he again went to South America, chiefly with a view to inspecting the German colonies there and reporting on the possibility of diverting the stream of German emigration in this direction. The result of his observations and experiences he recorded in Achtzehn Monate in S\u00fcdamerika (1862). In 1862 he accompanied Duke Ernest of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Egypt and Abyssinia, and on his return settled at Coburg, where he wrote a number of novels descriptive of the scenes he had visited.In 1867\u20131868 Gerst\u00e4cker again undertook a long journey, visiting North America, Venezuela and the West Indies.

On his return, he lived first at Dresden and then at Brunswick. While preparing for a journey to India, China and Japan, he suffered a fatal cerebral haemorrhage on May 31, 1872.\nThe widely traveled adventurer left an oeuvre of 44 volumes, which he edited himself for his Jena publisher H. Costenoble. His stories and novels inspired numerous imitators: Karl May profited from him and used landscape descriptions as well as subjects and characters. Even theatre and movie companies borrowed from his work: the critic George Jean Nathan credits the plot of the musical Brigadoon (1954) to Gerst\u00e4cker's short story Germelshausen, though this was denied by Lerner, the author of Brigadoon.\nThe Friedrich-Gerst\u00e4cker-Gesellschaft e.V.

That was relatively easy for the Lichtenberg part of the country, to which the 1643 treaty did not apply. It took considerable financial effort in 1717, however, to include the passive fiefs of the Bishopric of Strasbourg and Archbishopric of Mainz into Ludwig's inheritance, because fiefs were usually only hereditary in the male line. For this payment, count Johann Reinhard III borrowed 100,000 florins from the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and pledged the Hanau district of Brandenstein as security for this loan.\nAnticipating the inheritance, Hesse-Kassel paid 600,000 taler to buy off claims by the Electorate of Saxony on the imperial fief held by Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg. Saxony had acquired these claims from the emperor during the Thirty Years' War. Hesse-Kassel pledged the districts Frauensee, Landeck and Treffurt; Frauensee and Landeck were redeemed in 1743.\nMost problematic, however, was whether the district of Babenhausen belonged to the Lichtenberg or the M\u00fcnzenberg part of the inheritance. Here, too, Count Johann Reinhard III tried to strengthen the position of his daughter and grandson in Hesse-Darmstadt. In a will written in 1729, he bequeathed Babenhausen to Ludwig IX of Hesse-Darmstadt. On this issue, Hesse-Kassel initially appeared to be cooperative. Agreements were signed in 1714, 1718 and 1720. In 1730, however, Landgrave Friedrich I of Hesse-Kassel came to the throne and Hesse-Kassel's stance changed. On 17 April 1730, he sent the Hessian army to Hanau, to ensure his future inheritance.

Finney was of Scotch-Irish descent; he was named in memory of Louis Klopsch, a German-American immigrant and founder of The Christian Herald magazine, who died in 1910.  An older brother, Hal, was also a Major League player, a catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nLou Finney's professional baseball career began in the minor leagues in 1930; the next season, he was called up to the pennant-bound Athletics in September, and he batted .375 in nine games\u2014including back-to-back three-hit outings against the Cleveland Indians on September 14\u201315.  He did not appear in the 1931 World Series, which Philadelphia lost to the St. Louis Cardinals, and spent 1932 with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League, batting .351 with 268 hits.\nFinney then split 1933 between the Athletics, getting into 74 games as a back-up outfielder, and the top-level Montreal Royals of the International League.  In 1934, he made the Athletics for good, but the Mackmen were beginning a 13-year streak of futility that would see them plummet to the bottom of the American League standings nine times, including 1935, 1936 and 1938.  Finney was the club's regular first baseman in both 1936 and 1938, batting .302 with 197 hits in the former year.\nThen, on May 8, 1939, his contract was purchased by the first division Red Sox.  With Boston, Finney benefited from the batting tips offered by Hall of Famer Hugh Duffy, a veteran Red Sox scout and hitting instructor.  He hit .325 in part-time service in 1939, then took over as the Red Sox' regular right fielder in 1940, with Ted Williams shifting to left field. Finney batted .320 with 171 hits, and was named to the 1940 American League All-Star Team.\nFinney held onto the Red Sox' right-fielder job in both 1941 and 1942, although his batting average dipped below .290 each season. With World War II raging, he spent the 1943 campaign working his Alabama farm before returning to the Majors for two full seasons (1944\u201345) and parts of 1946 and 1947.\nIn 15 Major League seasons, Finney played in 1,270 games and had 4,631 at bats, 643 runs scored, 1,329 hits, 203 doubles, 85 triples, 31 home runs, 494 runs batted in, 39 stolen bases, 329 bases on balls, a .287 batting average, .336 on-base percentage, .388 slugging percentage, 1,795 total bases and 63 sacrifice hits.

In 1911 he acquired the Ch\u00e2teau de Mivoisin, a 36 square kilometre property located 1\u00bd hours south of Paris in Dammarie-sur-Loing, Loiret.\nIn 1941, Boussac was made a member of the National Council of Vichy France.\nIn 1946, he financed Christian Dior's new Paris fashion house that became one of the most famous clothing and perfume marques. In 1951 Boussac expanded into the newspaper business with the acquisition of L'Aurore.\nAn avid horseman, Marcel Boussac acquired the Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard horse breeding farm in Neuvy-au-Houlme in Lower Normandy and the Haras de Jardy in Marnes-la-Coquette. As part of his breeding operation, Boussac bought and sold horses from across Europe plus from the United States. He acquired the U.S. Triple Crown winner Whirlaway and sold the mare La Troienne to Edward R. Bradley's Idle Hour Stock Farm in Lexington, Kentucky who became one of the most influential mares to be imported into the U.S. in the 20th century.\nBoussac's horses, carrying Boussac's signature orange silk and grey cap, dominated French horse racing from the 1930s through to the 1960s making his stable the leading money winner fourteen times and the leading breeder on seventeen occasions. In addition to being a six-time winner of France's most important race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Boussac's horses also won the prestigious Epsom Derby, Epsom Oaks, 2,000 Guineas, St. Leger Stakes, Ascot Gold Cup and others in the United Kingdom.\n\nWith the Fall of France in the Second World War, Boussac paid a British Royal Air Force officer on secret business to fly him from Paris to the UK. This caused the officer Sidney Cotton to be removed from his position. During the German occupation of France in World War II, the Nazis seized some of the best racehorses in the country. They shipped more than six hundred of them out of the country, some to Hungary but most back to Germany for racing or for breeding at the German National Stud. Among them was the champion Pharis, owned by Marcel Boussac.\nHe was married for many years to the Belgian opera singer Fanny Heldy. They are buried together in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Montmartre in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris.\nOn his death in 1980, Boussac's estate was liquidated and L'Aurore sold to Robert Hersant who merged it with his Le Figaro newspaper. The property itself would eventually be acquired by Stavros Niarchos. The Aga Khan IV had purchased the bulk of the Boussac farm's breeding stock in 1978 when Boussac's companies were declared bankrupt.In his honor, the Prix Marcel Boussac, a Group One Stakes Race, is run annually at the Longchamp Racecourse.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Manuha ruled Thaton from 1030s until 1057 when he was defeated by King Anawrahta of Pagan Kingdom.:\u200a150\u200a According to the Mon tradition, Manuha was the 59th in the line of kings who supposedly founded Thaton during the time of the Buddha in the 6th century BCE.\nTraditional Burmese and Mon reconstructions also hold that Anawrahta, a recent convert to Theravada Buddhism, asked for the Theravada Buddhist canon from Manuha. The Mon king reputedly rejected Anawrahta's request, saying that the uncultured Burmans of the north were not worthy of the religion. This refusal was used by Anawrahta as pretense to invade and conquer the Mon kingdom. Despite this account, it is more likely Anawrahta conquered Thaton in order to check the westward advance of Khmer Empire in the Tenasserim coast. Still according to traditional belief, Manuha and his family along with some 30,000 monks and artisans, were brought back to Pagan (Bagan). Between 1050 and about 1085, Mon craftsmen and artisans helped to build some two thousand monuments at Pagan, the remains of which today rival the splendors of Angkor Wat.However, recent research\u2014still a minority view\u2014argues that Mon influence on the interior after Anawrahta's conquest is a greatly exaggerated post-Pagan legend, and that Lower Burma in fact lacked a substantial independent polity prior to Pagan's expansion.

She was reported to have had a vision of angels at age six. Feeling called to consecrated life, she rejected a marriage arranged by her father. Unable to explain her attraction to religious life to her father, in 1463, at the age of 14, she secretly received the religious habit of the Third Order of St. Dominic. She had been drawn to this Order from her admiration of two members of the Order, Catherine of Siena, and her contemporary, Friar Girolamo Savonarola, who both represented to her lives of strict self-denial.Returning home, Osanna explained that she had made a religious vow and had to wear it until she had fulfilled her promise., which is an ancient custom. She waited 37 years to complete her vows so she could care for her brothers and sisters after the death of her parents.A legend states that Osanna, like Catherine of Siena, miraculously learned to read and write. One day she saw a piece of paper with two words and said, \"Those words are 'Jesus' and 'Mary.'\" Allegedly, from that time on, anything relating to the spiritual was within her grasp.When Osanna was thirty years old, she received the stigmata on her head, her side and her feet. She also had a vision in which her heart was transformed and divided into four parts. For the rest of her life, she actively experienced the Passion of Jesus, but especially intensely on Wednesdays and Fridays. Osanna confided these things in her biographer and \"spiritual son,\" the Olivetan monk, Dom Jerome of Mount Olivet, as well as the fact that for years, she subsisted on practically no food at all.\nOsanna was a mystic who would fall into ecstasies whenever she spoke of God, and a visionary who saw images of Christ bearing his cross. She bore stigmata along with red marks, but there was no bleeding. She helped the poor and sick and served as spiritual director for many, spending much of her family's considerable fortune to help the unfortunate. She spoke out against decadence, and criticized the aristocracy for a lack of morality. She was a friend of another member of her Order, Columba of Rieti, and is recorded to have sought counsel from another, the Stephana de Quinzanis.These phenomena brought Ossana to the attention of Mantua's ruling family. Most notably, she was sought by Francesco II Gonzaga and his wife, Isabella d'Este, as both a spiritual guide and a counselor on matters of state.

The son, who was distinguished for his learning, personal beauty, and engaging qualities, gained the favour of Alexios I and the hand of his daughter Anna Komnene, receiving the titles of Caesar and panhypersebastos (one of the new dignities introduced by Alexios).

The marriage took place two years later.Bryennios successfully defended the walls of Constantinople against the attacks of Godfrey of Bouillon during the First Crusade (1097).

After Sigismund's death in 1501, it reverted to Bavaria-Munich.\nThe marriage of Kunigunde of Austria to Albert IV was a result of intrigues and deception, but must be counted as a defeat for Emperor Frederick III.

Probably in this period Simplician moved to Milan where he remained.\nSimplician took also an active part in the conversions of both Alypius of Thagaste and Augustine of Hippo. The meeting between Augustine and Simplican occurred in Milan in 386 and it is recorded in Augustine's Confessions.

Thus in April 397, the aged Simplician was elected bishop of Milan, at that time capital of the Western Roman Empire. The most important act of his episcopate was the receipt in Milan of the relics of the three martyrs Sisinnius, Martyrius and Alexander, sent from Trento by the bishop Vigilius.Simplician was asked to judge some doctrinal statements by the Council of Carthage (397) and by the First Council of Toledo.

Simplician's feast day was later moved to 16 August so as not to conflict with the Assumption of Mary, and with the reform of the Ambrosian Rite that occurred after the Second Vatican Council his feast day was moved to 14 August.Simplician was initially buried in the church of Saint Nabor and Felix in Milan and later translated, perhaps on 15 August, to the Basilica Virginum (\"Basilica of the Virgins\") which was renamed in his honor; now it is known as Basilica of St. Simplician.

It was widely reported that he was struck in the mouth by a thrown brick or a piece of concrete and required 12 stitches to the underside of his upper lip. Factual documentation of the details of the incident is sparse, consisting primarily of claims made by Hirt after the incident although police reported that the 1970 Mardi Gras was one of the worst for trouble, with hundreds arrested for drunkenness and violence. Whatever the actual cause of his injuries, Hirt underwent surgery and made a return to the club scene. This incident was parodied in a Saturday Night Live skit from their second season Mardi Gras special, the \"Let's Hit Al Hirt in the Mouth with a Brick Contest\".In 1987, Hirt played a solo rendition of \"Ave Maria\" for Pope John Paul II's visit to New Orleans. He is referred to in the 1987 film Good Morning, Vietnam, in a broadcast made by Lieutenant Hauk (Bruno Kirby).\nHirt died of liver failure at the age of 76, after having spent the previous year in a wheelchair due to edema in his leg. He was survived by his wife, Beverly Essel Hirt, and eight children from a previous marriage.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Stayner, taking a leave of absence from his job, acted as an advisor for Lorimar-Telepictures and had a non-speaking part, playing one of the two policemen who escort 14-year-old Steven (played by Corin Nemec) through the crowds to his waiting family. Although pleased with the dramatization, Stayner did complain that it depicted him as a somewhat \"obnoxious, rude\" person, especially toward his parents, something he refuted while publicizing the miniseries in the spring of 1989. The miniseries was first broadcast by NBC on May 21\u201322, 1989. Screening rights were sold to a number of international television companies including the BBC, which screened the miniseries in mid-July of the following year; later still, it was released as a feature-length movie.The production, which received four Emmy Award nominations, including one for Nemec, was based on a manuscript by Mike Echols, who had researched the story and interviewed Stayner and Parnell, among others. After the premiere, Echols published his book, also titled I Know My First Name is Steven, in 1991. In the epilogue to his book, Echols describes how he infiltrated NAMBLA. In 1999, against the wishes of the Stayner family, Echols wrote an additional chapter about Steven's older brother Cary at the request of his publisher, which then re-published the book.The title of the film and book are taken from the first paragraph of Steven's written police statement, given during the early hours of March 2, 1980, in Ukiah.

{"id": "20_280", "question": "Where did Giuseppe Guarneri die?", "ctxs": [{"id": "20_20131", "text": "The most illustrious member of the house of Guarneri, Bartolomeo was the son of Giuseppe Giovanni Battista, thus the grandson of Andrea Guarneri, both noted violin makers themselves. Andrea learned his trade as an apprentice of Nicol\u00f2 Amati, to whom Stradivari was also apprenticed. Undoubtedly, Giuseppe learned the craft of violinmaking in his father's shop.\nGiuseppe Guarneri's style has been widely copied by luthiers since the 19th century. Guarneri's career is a great contrast to that of Stradivari, who was stylistically consistent, very careful about craftsmanship and finish, and evolved the design of his instruments in a deliberate way over seven decades. Guarneri's career was short, from the late 1720s until his death in 1744. Initially he was thought to be a man of restless creativity, judging by his constant experimentation with f-holes, arching, thicknesses of the top and back and other design details. However, what has become clear is that, like other members of his family, he was so commercially overshadowed by his illustrious and business-savvy neighbor, Antonio Stradivari, that he was unable to command prices commensurate with his rival, hence needed to make more instruments and work hastily. Indeed, two of the five violin makers of the Guarneri family, the two Pietros\u2014of different generations\u2014left Cremona, the first for Mantua, the second for Venice, apparently because business prospects in Cremona were so stunted by the presence of Stradivari. From the 1720s until about 1737, Guarneri's work is quick and accurate, although he was not overly concerned with quality of finish. However, from the late 1730s until his death, his work shows increasing haste and lack of patience with the time needed to achieve a high quality finish. Some of his late violins from circa 1742 to 1744 have scrolls that can be crudely carved, the purfling hastily inserted, the f-holes unsymmetrical and jagged.Nonetheless, many of these late violins, in spite of the seeming haste and carelessness of their construction, possess a glorious tone and have been much coveted by soloists. His output falls off rather dramatically in the late 1730s, and the eccentricity of the works following that period gave rise to the romantic notion that he had been imprisoned for killing a rival violin maker (actually it was one of the Lavazza brothers in Milan to whom this occurred), and even the unlikely fiction that he made violins in prison. Such stories were invented during the nineteenth century and were repeated by the biographers of the Guarneri family, the Hills, in their 1931 work; while the Hills did not take them at face-value (this is an understatement borderline misrepresentative  of what the Hills wrote p89 of The Violin-Makers of the Guarneri Family (1626\u20131762): Their Life and Work,  they treat those stories as \"gossip\" \"pretty legend\" by \"Cozio embroidered by Fetis\" \"superficial and inaccurate\" ) , it did feed into their idea that Giuseppe Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 must have been temperamental and mercurial, rather than simply overworked and commercially unsuccessful (p.91 of The Violin-Makers of the Guarneri Family (1626\u20131762): Their Life and Work  the Hills state that  IF you were to trust the stories gathered from the last  Bergonzi (not the one from Cozio) them you would have a reasonable explanation ). More recent data shows that business was so bad during the later period of his life that he had to relegate violin-making to the sideline and earn his living as an innkeeper (refuting the \"prison\" myth). (source missing !)   \n\nIt has also become known that some of the violins emanating from his shop and bearing his label were actually the work of his German wife, Katarina Rota, who apparently returned to Germany after her husband's death in 1744. While every other member of his family, the Stradivari family, Nicol\u00f2 Amati, and a peculiarly large number of makers, lived long lives\u2014Stradivari living and working to age 93\u2014Guarneri died at only 46. There is thus the possibility that the odd qualities of finish in his later instruments\u2014ironically, those most highly prized and expensive\u2014were due not only to stress and haste but also to encroaching illness. It is also worth noting that the tone of both Stradivari and Guarneri did not come into their own until late in the 18th century, that the high-built instruments of Amati and Stainer were the only ones prized during the 18th century. While it is true that players, then as now, preferred old instruments, Stradivari made one of the handsomest livings of all violin makers during his lifetime. It is also customary to conflate Stradivari and Guarneri in this regard, but even the Hills hinted that such was not the case in their styles, the Guarneri always bearing traces of Amati, and even Stainer, the latter Stradivari \"would have none of.\" Moreover, Guarneri's instruments were recognized by a world-class soloist three decades before Stradivari's were likewise championed; by the 1750s, Gaetano Pugnani is known to have acquired and preferred a Giuseppe Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 violin, but it is not until the 1780s that his pupil, Giovanni Battista Viotti, became an advocate of Stradivari instruments. Of course, Pugnani's advocacy is usually forgotten when Niccol\u00f2 Paganini became the most noted Giuseppe Guarneri player three generations later.\nAccomplished violinists such as\nSalvatore Accardo, \nSarah Chang, Nikki Chooi,\nTimothy Chooi,\nKyung-wha Chung, \nEugene Fodor,\nAugustin Hadelich, \nJascha Heifetz,\nYi-Jia Susanne Hou,\nJoseph Joachim, \nLeila Josefowicz, \nNigel Kennedy, \nLeonid Kogan, \nHenning Kraggerud, \nFritz Kreisler, \nGidon Kremer, \nYang Liu,\nKerson Leong,\nRobert McDuffie,Anne Akiko Meyers, \nMidori, \nElmar Oliveira, \nRuth Palmer, \nItzhak Perlman, \nRachel Barton Pine, \nMaud Powell, \nMichael Rabin,\nAaron Rosand,\nCharlie Siem, \nMarie Soldat, \nIsaac Stern, \nHenryk Szeryng,\nArve Tellefsen,\nRichard Tognetti, \nUto Ughi, \nHenri Vieuxtemps, \nTianwa Yang,\nEug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe,\nZvi Zeitlin,  \nand Pinchas Zukerman, have used Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 violins at one point in their career or even exclusively.\nVirtuoso Niccol\u00f2 Paganini's favorite violin, Il Cannone Guarnerius of 1743, and the Lord Wilton of 1742, once owned by Yehudi Menuhin, are del Ges\u00f9 instruments. In addition, the Vieuxtemps Guarneri\u2014once owned by Henri Vieuxtemps\u2014was sold in 2013 close to its asking price of $18 million USD, making it the most expensive instrument in the world. Jascha Heifetz owned a c. 1740 Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 from the 1920s until his death in 1987. It was his favorite instrument, even though he owned several Stradivarius.

He was sworn in on January 2, 1960. At the time he took office, the district attorney in Hinds County was a part-time job with little expected of its incumbent. Many previous attorneys had used the office to promote their own private legal services. Waller attempted to reform the position, and provoked the ire of local law enforcement for aggressively prosecuting several cases, including a white man who had murdered a black man and a wealthy woman who had murdered her husband. Despite this, his legal practice expanded during his tenure with several new partners. He also befriended Mississippi political columnist Bill Minor.As the district attorney, Waller prosecuted Byron De La Beckwith in the murder of civil rights advocate Medgar Evers in two trials in 1964, both of which resulted in mistrials due to deadlocked juries. Waller did not approve of Evers' activism and did not view the trials as a means to denounce Jim Crow racial segregation, but saw it as an opportunity to demonstrate that laws would be upheld in the state. Most observers agreed Waller ably presented his case against Beckwith, establishing his rifle as the murder weapon and using witnesses to establish his presence in the vicinity of the killing on the night it had occurred. Though worried that it might backfire among the white jury members, Waller also attempted to establish a motive for the murder by getting Beckwith to testify to his support for white supremacy and staunch opposition to racial integration. Fears among white Mississippians that Waller was a \"liberal\" for trying De Le Beckwith led his firm to lose clients. Numerous observers speculated that the trials would damage his political prospects, with The New York Times writing in February 1964 that \"He may have put his career on the block by his tireless prosecution of the case\". Despite this, he won some national acclaim for convincing several white jurors to vote for conviction and ingratiated himself to Mississippi's black population. Beckwith was later convicted after a third trial in 1994.By the mid-1960s, Waller was disenchanted with Mississippi's political leaders' hardline efforts to resist desegregation. In 1967, he ran for the office of governor in the Democratic primary. Not backed by a significant campaign organization, he was low on resources and confined to active campaigning on the weekends. The contest was dominated by issues of race. Waller attempted to straddle both sides of the issue, becoming the first Mississippian gubernatorial candidate to ever publicly condemn the Ku Klux Klan while also criticizing civil rights activists and praising the work of Citizens' Councils. Largely ignored by the public in favor of other segregationist candidates, he placed fifth in the primary, earning 60,090 votes, only nine percent of the vote.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His taste for syntactic inversions, with which he generously adorned his prose, led to the nickname \"the inversive Viscount\", and the result was memorably parodied in Illusions perdues by Balzac (who, nevertheless, was strongly influenced in his first works by the gothic style of d'Arlincourt). The Academic Charles-Marie de F\u00e9letz wrote that \"Le Solitaire has so far been translated into every single known language, except of course French.\" Later assessments were no more favourable. His novels, now classified as \"gothic\", were then labelled fr\u00e9n\u00e9tique: \"containing a mysterious intrigue centred on some illustrious and guilty wretch who traipses through a thousand violent incidents towards a bloody catastrophe.\"\nD'Arlincourt's vanity and egocentricity were the subject of many anecdotes, including a story of his attempts to persuade his portrait-painter, Robert Lef\u00e8vre, to make his eyes look larger and larger, until they were \"like those of an ox\"; the result was still considered unsatisfactory by his wife, who confronted the painter, turning to her husband and telling him to \"Do that thing with your eyes.\" (Mon ami, fais tes yeux.) He also posed for Jean-Baptiste Isabey.\nD'Arlincourt frequently defended himself in print, explaining that it was his goal to \"spiritualize all the impressions of existence\"; he presented a play he wrote in his youth, Le Si\u00e8ge de Paris, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais in 1826, but it was promptly torn to pieces by the critics. Not always justly: some of the most ridiculed extracts are not in fact by him.\nHe made two long journeys through Europe, in 1841 and 1844, visiting exiled princes, and on his return presented a new play, La Peste noire, which was received no more favourably than the first. In 1848, outraged by the events of June, he published Dieu le veut! (\"God wills it!\"), a pamphlet which led to legal troubles for the author but also increased his popularity. In 1850 he published L'Italie rouge, a hostile account of the Risorgimento. In the last years of his life, still \"avid for acclaim\", he was a frequent guest of salons.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Although Adriaen and his brother Isaack were born in Haarlem, they adopted the name \"van Ostade\" as painters. According to the RKD, he became a pupil in 1627 of the portrait painter Frans Hals, at that time the master of Jan Miense Molenaer. In 1632, he is registered in Utrecht (where, like Jacob Duck, he was probably influenced by the village scenes of Joost Cornelisz Droochsloot, which were popular in his day), but in 1634 he was back in Haarlem where he joined the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. Aged 26, he joined a company of the civic guard at Haarlem, and at twenty-eight he married. His wife died two years later in 1640. In 1657, \"as a widower\", he married Anna Ingels. He again became a widower in 1666. He opened a workshop and took on pupils.

Jonas Witsen (1676\u20131715) was the man who convinced Houbraken to move to Amsterdam from Dordrecht. He had been the city secretary and was probably his patron.

{"id": "20_330", "question": "Where did John Wetton die?", "ctxs": [{"id": "20_20255", "text": "Wetton was born in Willington, Derbyshire, and grew up in Bournemouth, Dorset, where he attended Bournemouth School. His elder brother Robert was a classical organist and choirmaster, and while practising organ would have John play the bass parts on a piano, since their home organ did not have a pedalboard. Wetton recalled that during these practices, \"I got to like bass lines, because Bach bass lines are incredibly interesting. So I thought, this is good, I like bass lines, that's me.\" Though an enthusiast of classical music since childhood, he opted to go into rock and roll instead in order to avoid being compared with his brother. He played bass and sang in a number of early bands with Richard Palmer-James, including The Corvettes, The Palmer-James Group, Tetrad, and Ginger Man. A key early band was the jazzy Mogul Thrash; after live work with Renaissance, he joined Family and also did various recording sessions.Wetton's big break came when his fellow Dorset native Robert Fripp invited him to join King Crimson in late 1972. This incarnation of the band also included violinist David Cross, former Yes drummer Bill Bruford, and percussionist Jamie Muir. His time in the band would allow Wetton to come into his own as a lead singer and writer. Wetton's old friend Richard Palmer-James also worked with the band as their primary lyricist. Wetton remained with the band until Fripp unexpectedly disbanded it in 1974. King Crimson maintained their interest in improvisation throughout this period, but moved away from the classical, jazz and English folk leanings of their earlier work. The 1972\u20131974 period featured a more aggressive fusion/avant-rock sound, led by Wetton's thunderous, melodic bass lines \u2013 whose \"roaring and crunching\" sound (enhanced with effects pedals and a rotating Leslie speaker cabinet, the latter of which was traditionally used with a Hammond organ) often verged on heavy metal. Fripp once compared playing onstage with Wetton and drummer Bill Bruford to working with \"a flying brick wall\".After the dissolution of King Crimson, Wetton continued to work on various projects, including a tour with Roxy Music and two albums with Uriah Heep. While still with King Crimson, Wetton had been asked by Roxy Music to \"sit in\" on their auditions for a replacement bass player and give his recommendations; dissatisfied with all the applicants, he offered to do the 1975 tour with the group himself so as to give them time to find a good bassist. In 1977, after failed attempts to reunite King Crimson and to create a new band with Rick Wakeman, Wetton formed U.K. with his King Crimson rhythm section partner Bill Bruford. Wetton recruited Roxy Music keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson, while Bruford brought in innovative guitarist Allan Holdsworth from his solo group. U.K. adopted a more composition-driven approach than King Crimson, per Wetton's preference.After the break-up of U.K., Wetton released his first solo album, Caught in the Crossfire (1980). Later that year he had a brief stint in Wishbone Ash, appearing on their album Number the Brave (1981). In late 1981 he had a meeting with Geffen Records' boss John Kalodner who took him to task for playing bass in Bryan Ferry's backing band, feeling he should be fronting a group himself. At Kalodner's insistence, Wetton started writing with former Yes guitarist Steve Howe, with a view to forming their own band. Joined by keyboardist Geoff Downes, and drummer Carl Palmer (of Emerson, Lake & Palmer), this band would become Asia, and they produced one of the bestselling albums of the 1980s. Their self-titled debut album Asia sold over 10 million copies worldwide, making the band a household name across the globe. Wetton worked with Asia until 1983, when he was fired (at the insistence of Geffen Records) for then-unknown reasons, but at least in part due to lower-than-expected sales of the Alpha (1983) album. He returned to Asia in 1985 (with Mandy Meyer replacing Steve Howe on guitar) to complete Astra (1985).In the late 1980s, a collaboration between Wetton and Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera was released as Wetton/Manzanera (1986). Around this time, Wetton began working with Geoff Downes and Carl Palmer to restart Asia. Some of the material they recorded was featured on 1990's Then & Now CD, including a radio hit in \"Days Like These\".\nThe 1990s saw Wetton mostly focusing on his solo career. In 1999, an aborted attempt to reform Asia resulted in Wetton and Carl Palmer forming a short-lived progressive group dubbed Qango with John Young and Dave Kilminster. Qango performed several shows in the UK, and recorded a live album, Live in the Hood, before disbanding.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Wetton reunited with Geoff Downes for Icon. In 2006, a reunion of the original Asia line-up (Wetton, Downes, Howe, Palmer) finally occurred. A studio album titled Phoenix (2008), the original band's first since 1983's Alpha, was released in April 2008 and peaked at No. 73 on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States. The original line-up released two more studio albums, Omega (2010) and XXX (2012) before Howe departed in January 2013 to focus on Yes. With new guitarist Sam Coulson, Asia released Gravitas in March of 2014.\nIn 2013, Wetton guested on the album Grandine il vento with Renaissance, with whom he had played live 42 years before. That same year, he toured with American Idol finalist Leslie Hunt's Chicago-based band District 97 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the King Crimson album Larks' Tongues In Aspic.\nWetton also worked extensively as a session musician with such musicians as Brian Eno, Bryan Ferry and Ayreon.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After the fall of Santa Anna in the 1854-55 Revolution of Ayutla that brought the liberals to power, M\u00e1rquez supported the conservative government in the Reform War (1858\u201360) against the liberal government of Benito Ju\u00e1rez. With Miguel Miram\u00f3n, the leading general of the conservatives, M\u00e1rquez initially found success against the liberal army, but the tide turned in 1860, and the liberals won on the battle field. He was called \"The Tiger of Tacubaya\", alluding to the Battle of Tacubaya (11 April 1859) where he ordered liberal officers and some medical personnel to be executed.  M\u00e1rquez pursued guerrilla warfare in the Sierra Gorda after the defeat of the conservatives on the battlefield; he is blamed for the murders of the prominent liberals Melchor Ocampo and General Leandro Valle.In 1862, he supported the conservatives' invitation to Maximilian Hapsburg to become the emperor of Mexico, although he did not participate in conservative politicians' plans for it. He did join the French forces under General Charles de Lorencez in the initial invasion. In 1864, M\u00e1rquez was given a mission to Constantinople. Meanwhile, in Mexico, the war led by the French was turning as Liberals were starting to win back their territory and the French emperor was now considering the pros and cons of the war in general.\nIn October 1866, Maximilian made him a division commander of forces around Mexico City, but he was unaware that M\u00e1rquez was causing dissension by forced conscription (leva) of troops and exacting protection money from residents of the capital.  French general Bazaine condemned M\u00e1rquez's methods of recruitment.  In March 1867, Maximilian sent him to Mexico City to form a cabinet and raise troops for the relief of Quer\u00e9taro, which was then under siege. M\u00e1rquez was a rival of Miguel Miram\u00f3n and disagreed with him frequently. Miram\u00f3n had proposed an assault on the republican army while they were divided, but M\u00e1rquez opposed the idea, possibly only because Miram\u00f3n had suggested it. He joined Maximilian at Quer\u00e9taro, and broke through the besiegers and almost reached the state capital. He was defeated before he could reach the city and returned to Mexico City, where he was besieged by liberal General Porfirio D\u00edaz. He made his way to Mexico City for the purpose of organizing a force to relieve the Emperor. Finding that to be impossible, he conceived the plan of setting up an independent government of his own in the southern states, with the city of Puebla as its capital, in order to continue the conservative cause which seemingly, along with the French, looked to be collapsing. \nHowever, it was too late and the emperor was captured on 21 June 1867, and M\u00e1rquez, after remaining in concealment for several months, made his way to Vera Cruz and then to Havana, while Maximilian and dedicated conservative generals Miguel Miram\u00f3n and Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00eda were executed by firing squad in Quer\u00e9taro. \nHe was expressly excluded from the Ju\u00e1rez's amnesty of 1870. He was allowed to return to Mexico in 1895, but returned to Cuban exile in 1901 due to his continuing unpopularity. He continued to defend his role in the Empire, and lived long enough to see start of the Mexican Revolution and the fall of Porfirio D\u00edaz, who had played such a key role in the defeat of the Empire forty years earlier.

The rifle was adopted as the Gewehr 71 or Infanterie-Gewehr 71 and was the first metal cartridge weapon of the German Empire. While Wilhelm handled the business side of the factory, Paul proved to be the more technically capable engineer.Peter Paul von Mauser made significant contributions to bolt action rifle design and successfully combined and improved various bolt action engineering concepts. The Mauser company bolt action development resulted in the Gewehr 98 and Karabiner 98k rifle series that were the latest in a line of Mauser bolt-action rifles that started with the Mauser Model 1889 and were adapted in 1889 and the 1890s as service rifles by several countries. The bolt-action design used for the Gewehr 98 was patented by Paul Mauser on 9 September 1895. Besides rifles, Paul Mauser also developed handguns, with the first Mauser designed handgun being the Mauser C78 revolver. In 1896, Paul Mauser would develop the C96 pistol, which was one of the first semi-automatic pistols in history.\nInitially, Mauser's designs were more successful abroad than in Prussia, but the Prussian Rifle Review Board in Spandau opted for the domestically developed 1888 rifle. Mauser designed an improved model of this rifle for the Imperial Order .\nThe name of Mauser is inseparable from the construction of the 1893 infantry rifle for Spain, 1894 carbine and 1896 infantry rifle for Sweden, with model rifles for Peru, Belgium, Argentina, the Brazil (1894), Chile (1895), then Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Mexico (1902), Uruguay and Turkey. Deliveries to these countries make the Mauser name a world-renowned guarantee of quality for precise weapons.\nThe construction of the Gewehr 98 rifle was personally praised by Kaiser Wilhelm II on April 5, 1898. Mauser lost his left eye in 1901 as a result of a cartridge explosion during a test firing of the self-loading C98.Mauser also designed the 7.65\u00d753mm Mauser (1889) and 7\u00d757mm Mauser (1892) rifle cartridges. These cartridges were high-performance service cartridge designs compared to other contemporary smokeless powder service cartridges such as the 8mm Lebel (1886), 8\u00d750mmR Mannlicher (1890) and .303 British (1891).", "hasanswer": false}]}

In July 1740 Faneuil had offered the town a large market building. This offer was by no means uncontroversial: Bostonians had debated throughout the eighteenth century whether a centralized market was preferable to peddling in the streets, bringing conveniences such as home delivery but also inconveniences including noisy push-cart hucksters and higher prices. Markets built by the town had been destroyed by a mob disguised as clergymen in 1737. Only by a vote of 367 to 360 did the Boston Town Meeting accept Faneuil's offer. The building took two years to construct and was named for Faneuil after his death. It was gutted by fire in March 1761; the walls remained, but the interior structure, to which the town meeting frequently adjourned to protest British policy as the American Revolution approached, was added after the fire. The room above the market stalls became a civic center where so many prerevolutionary meetings were held that Faneuil Hall became known as America's \"Cradle of Liberty.\" Faneuil Hall still stands, although it is dwarfed by the Quincy Market complex built behind it in the nineteenth century.\n\nAlthough Faneuil enjoyed the good life, his contemporaries and posterity honor him most highly as a public benefactor. John Lovell, who gave his funeral eulogy, said that Faneuil \"fed the hungry and he cloathed the naked, he comforted the fatherless, and the widows in their affliction.\" An obituary noted that he was \"a gentleman, possessed of a very ample fortune and a most generous spirit,\" his \"noble benefaction to his town and constant employment of a great number of tradesmen, artificers, and laborers, to whom he was a liberal paymaster . . . made his life a public blessing, and his death a general loss.\" In Faneuil's case such praise was more than routine kindness to the recently deceased. He donated liberally to the Episcopal Charitable Society, an endowment for the families of the deceased clergymen of Trinity Church, to which he belonged, and was treasurer of the project to build the present King's Chapel. Other wealthy Boston Anglicans apparently lacked his fervor, for the project languished for five years after his death following his gift of \u00a3200 sterling.\nEvidently little is known of Faneuil's treatment of his own slaves, only that he engaged in a trade that was lawful at the time.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is viewed as the messiah who will lead the peoples of Africa and the African diaspora to freedom. His official titles are Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah and King of Kings of Ethiopia, Lord of Lords and Elect of God, and his traditional lineage is thought to be from Solomon and Sheba. These notions are perceived by Rastafari as confirmation of the return of the messiah in the prophetic Book of Revelation in the New Testament: King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and Root of David. Rastafari faith in the incarnate divinity of Haile Selassie began after news reports of his coronation reached Jamaica, particularly via the two Time magazine articles on the coronation the week before and the week after the event. Haile Selassie's own perspectives permeate the philosophy of the movement.In 1961, the Jamaican government sent a delegation composed of both Rastafari and non-Rastafari leaders to Ethiopia to discuss the matter of repatriation, among other issues, with the emperor. He reportedly told the Rastafari delegation (which included Mortimer Planno), \"Tell the Brethren to be not dismayed, I personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation.\"\nHaile Selassie visited Jamaica on 21 April 1966, and approximately one hundred thousand Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on Palisadoes Airport in Kingston to greet him. Spliffs and chalices were openly smoked, causing \"a haze of ganja smoke\" to drift through the air. Haile Selassie arrived at the airport but was unable to come down the airplane's mobile steps, as the crowd rushed the tarmac. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally, Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras Mortimer Planno, a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the emperor's descent. Planno re-emerged and announced to the crowd: \"The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land\". This day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement, and it is still commemorated by Rastafari as Grounation Day, the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after 2 November, the emperor's Coronation Day.From then on, as a result of Planno's actions, the Jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that Rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by the emperor, and Rastafari elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the emperor, where he reportedly told them that they should not emigrate to Ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of Jamaica. This dictum came to be known as \"liberation before repatriation\".\nHaile Selassie defied expectations of the Jamaican authorities and never rebuked the Rastafari for their belief in him as God. Instead, he presented the movement's faithful elders with gold medallions\u2014the only recipients of such an honor on this visit. During PNP leader (later Jamaican Prime Minister) Michael Manley's visit to Ethiopia in October 1969, the emperor allegedly still recalled his 1966 reception with amazement, and stated that he felt that he had to be respectful of their beliefs. This was the visit when Manley received the Rod of Correction or Rod of Joshua as a present from the emperor, which is thought to have helped him to win the 1972 election in Jamaica.Rita Marley, Bob Marley's wife, converted to the Rastafari faith after seeing Haile Selassie on his Jamaican trip. She claimed in interviews (and in her book No Woman, No Cry) that she saw a stigmata print on the palm of Haile Selassie's hand as he waved to the crowd, which resembled the markings on Christ's hands from being nailed to the cross\u2014a claim that was not supported by other sources, but was used as evidence for her and other Rastafari to suggest that Haile Selassie I was indeed their messiah. Rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world due to the popularity of Bob Marley.Bob Marley's posthumously released song \"Iron Lion Zion\" may refer to Haile Selassie.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In return, he pledged faithfulness to the Mughal emperor. He also agreed to keep a force of 500 soldiers at the emperor's court, in addition to providing a force of 4,000 soldiers on a need basis.In 1748, Javed Khan, a rival of the Mughal wazir Safdarjung invited the new Nizam of Hyderabad Nasir Jung, to join an alliance against the wazir. Safdarjung requested Maratha support against Nasir Jung. Balaji Rao dispatched Scindia and Holkar chiefs to prevent Nasir Jung from reaching Delhi, and thus, saved Safdarjung.Starting in 1748, the Afghan king Ahmad Shah Durrani (Abdali) launched several invasions of India, forcing the Mughals to seek Maratha help. In 1752, the Rohillas of the Doab region rebelled against the Mughal emperor. They defeated Safdarjung in a battle, and invited Durrani to invade India. Once again, Safdarjung sought assistance from the Marathas, who helped him crush the rebellion. The Marathas and the Mughals signed an agreement in 1752. The Marathas agreed to help the Mughals defeat external aggressions as well as internal rebellions. The Mughals agreed to appoint Peshwa Balaji Rao as the Governor of Ajmer and Agra. The Marathas were also granted the right to collect chauth from Lahore, Multan, Sindh, and some districts of Hissar and Moradabad. However, the Mughal emperor had also ceded Lahore and Multan to Ahmad Shah Durrani in order to pacify him.

One of them had been hailed as heir to the throne by the grandees of the kingdom when Canute was still alive. Whether this was Eric we do not know, nor do the sources disclose the names of his three brothers. In spite of the precautions of King Canute, his sons were passed over in favour of Sverker Karlsson, the head of the rival dynasty of the Sverkers. Perhaps this was due to the influence of the mighty second-of-the-realm, Jarl Birger Brosa. As far as we know the succession took place without bloodshed.\nKing Canute's sons continued to live in the Swedish royal court and were raised by King Sverker. Several years later, after the death of Birger Brosa, the brothers and their supporters brought forward claims to the throne. King Sverker did not acquiesce, at which point Eric and his brothers escaped to Norway where they stayed over the winter of 1204\u201305. Eric and his brothers had kin ties with the Norwegian Birkebeiner party since Jarl H\u00e5kon Galen was married to their cousin, and sought their support.

Sverker on his side received troops from King Valdemar Sejr of Denmark. In January 1208 Eric nevertheless defeated Sverker in the Battle of Lena and slew the Danish commander Ebbe Sunesen, whose troops suffered great losses.

Other stars she shared the same bill as included the Rolling Stones, Sacha Distel, Rod Stewart and the Faces, Engelbert Humperdinck and Shirley Bassey.\nAs her popularity in England grew, Perrie began performing in other countries. She toured South Africa seven times and also visited Germany, Paris, Australia and the United States. In her book, Secrets of the Street, Perrie recalled how she had made headlines during her first tour of South Africa. She wrote, \"[I performed in] a concert down the impressive Cango Caves. A recording of the concert was released over there. I made history as the first female to perform so far underground.\"From 1963 to 1968, Perrie made several television appearances as a guest artiste, notably on the popular ITV Stars and Garters variety show, with Kathy Kirby, and The Good Old Days, the BBC's long-running light entertainment programme.\nDespite later concentrating primarily on acting, Perrie still continued to perform her variety act in the clubs when she joined Coronation Street full-time. In her book, she revealed that she sang on the first night of Peter Stringfellow's Hippodrome 'Gay Evening' in London, adding: \"I always had a loyal gay following \u2013 and the lesbians loved me too!\"By this time, she was also often asked to work as a compere. Terry Dobson, a member of the pop band Black Lace, recalled a time in 1977 in his book: \"Lynne Perrie was in and out of her dressing room, a change of costume between every act, not that much time, two songs, some six or so minutes and she was on the stage again, bring off the act, then introducing the next ... brilliant, and very professional; you could tell she had been doing this sort of thing for years.\"As well as on the stage, Perrie also continued to sing occasionally on television, notably on a UK charity telethon in 1990, in which she performed an original song called \"Ships that Pass in the Night\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

From 1678 to at least 1685 he apprenticed as a draper in the City of London, initially to his eldest brother. He was married no later than May 1687, when a daughter was born. Five of his eight children survived infancy. From 1687 to 1703, he may have run his own drapery shop. From at least March 1701, he lived at Giltspur Street, where he made air-pumps and pneumatic engines.The transition from drapery to scientific instrumentation and experimentation is not well documented. Historians have had to speculate about the events that lead to Hauksbee engagement with the Royal Society. Hauksbee became Isaac Newton's lab assistant. He became a member of the Royal Society on 30 November 1703. On 15 December 1703, he made his first experimental demonstration to the Society (a new air-pump and the phenomenon of \u2018mercurial phosphorus,\u2019 a kind of electrostatic discharge).

Wodehouse described Robinson as a \"walking Encyclopaedia Britannica\".

Wodehouse witnessed Percy Jeeves bowling at Cheltenham Cricket Festival in 1913. Percy Jeeves was killed at the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, less than a year after the first appearance of the Wodehouse character who would make his name a household word.In a letter written in 1965, Wodehouse wrote that he had read Harry Leon Wilson's Ruggles of Red Gap when it was first published as a magazine serial in 1914 and it influenced the creation of Jeeves. Ruggles of Red Gap is a comedic novel about an English valet who is won by an American from an English earl in a poker game. In the letter, Wodehouse wrote, \"I felt that an English valet would never have been so docile about being handed over to an American in payment of a poker debt.

{"id": "20_410", "question": "Where did George Buchanan die?", "ctxs": [{"id": "20_20493", "text": "Buchanan entered diplomatic service in 1876 and served as Second Secretary in Tokyo, Vienna and Bern and as Secretary in Rome. By 1899, he was serving on the Venezuelan Boundary Commission and later that year was appointed charg\u00e9 d'affaires at Darmstadt and Karlsruhe. In late 1901, he moved to Berlin, where he was appointed First Secretary at the British embassy. From 1903 to 1908, he was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Bulgaria, and in 1909, he was appointed as Minister to the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Invested with the Knight's Grand Cross of Royal Victorian Order in 1909, he was next sworn to the Privy Council. In 1910, Buchanan was appointed as the British Ambassador to Russia. He kept abreast of the political developments in Russia and met some of the leading liberal reformists in the country.\nWhen the Dardanelles were guaranteed by Germany to the Ottoman Empire, Italy sent two secret documents via the British diplomatic corps from Sir Michael Rodd to Buchanan at St Petersburg. They were the evidence that Russia needed to persuade Italy to support its Serbian policy in the Balkans. On 4 March 1915, Imperiali, the Italian envoy to London, presented the documents to Sir Edward Grey on the 16 February authority from Italian Foreign Minister Sonnino. France attached great importance to Italy's decision to join the Allies.  Buchanan brought Count Sazonov to the negotiating table.\nIt has been suggested that to have been secretly encouraged by the then Liberal government in London:\n\nThe British Ambassador George Buchanan was only too aware of the court's 'pro-German sympathies'. He complained to the Duma President, M.V. Rodzianko, in November 1916 that he found it difficult to get an audience at court, and expressed his view 'that Germany is using Alexandra Fedorovna to set the Tsar against the Allies'. Elsewhere, however, Buchanan stated his view that the Empress was 'the unwitting instrument of Germany'.\nBuchanan had developed a strong bond with Tsar Nicholas II and attempted to convince him that granting some constitutional reform would stave off revolution. Buchanan actively supported the Duma in its efforts to change Russia's stately system during wartime. Nicholas's opinion of him was under the Tsarina's sway.  Knowing that there were plots to stage a palace coup to replace him, Buchanan formally requested an audience with the Tsar in the troubled early days of 1917.  At his last meeting with Nicholas, Buchanan pleaded with him in 'undiplomatic' language: \"I can but plead as my excuse the fact that I have throughout been inspired by my feelings of devotion for Your Majesty and the Empress. If I were to see a friend walking through a wood on a dark night along a path which I knew ended in a precipice, would it not be my duty, sir, to warn him of his danger?  And is it not equally my duty to warn Your Majesty of the abyss that lies ahead of you? You have, sir, come to the parting of the ways, and you have now to choose between two paths. The one will lead you to victory and a glorious peace \u2013 the other to revolution and disaster. Let me implore Your Majesty to choose the former.\"Although the Tsar was touched by the Ambassador's devotion, he allowed his wife's malevolent attitudes to outweigh the sensible advice that he had been given. After the collapse of the autocracy (see Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia), he developed close relations with the liberal Provisional Government, which was led initially by George Lvov and later by Alexander Kerensky and was formed after the February Revolution. At the same time, Buchanan developed a fear of the dangers of Bolshevism and its growing support. He feared that the Russian Provisional Government would be toppled and tried to warn of the fragility of the government and the dangers of a Bolshevik revolution.  Buchanan had reported to London: \"They are more active and better organized than any other group, and until they and the ideas which they represent are finally squashed, the country will remain a prey to anarchy and disorder. If the Government are not strong enough to put down the Bolsheviks by force, at the risk of breaking altogether with the soviet, the only alternative will be a Bolshevik Government.\" However, after the events of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks' ascension to power, Buchanan was widely criticized for failing to ensure that Tsar and his family were evacuated from Russia before their execution by the Bolsheviks at Ekaterinburg in 1918. It is now known that was not the fault of Buchanan but that of the Tsar's first cousin, King George V, who feared revolutionary trends in Britain and the stability of his own throne and so persuaded the Lloyd George government to rescind the offer that had made to provide sanctuary for the Imperial Family.Buchanan was disappointed that the fledgling democracy offered by the Provisional Government was strangled by the Bolshevik coup.\nIn early December 1918, Buchanan fell ill and for the good of his health agreed that it was best for him to leave Russia. His family left St Petersburg on 26 December 1918 and arrived back in Leith, in Scotland, on 17 January 1919. His health soon collapsed, which forced him to spend time recovering in Cornwall.\nAfter his recovery, he was disappointed that after all of his years of service, he was not given a peerage and offered only a two-year ambassadorship in Rome. He accepted the post and served as ambassador to the Kingdom of Italy from 1919 to 1921. While in Italy his wife was found to have terminal cancer and died in April 1921, soon after the family's return to England.Buchanan's autobiography, My Mission to Russia and Other Diplomatic Memories, was published in 1923.

{"id": "20_416", "question": "Where did Hugh Guthrie die?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_41394", "text": "The genesis of \"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\" reportedly occurred when Guthrie was struck by the fact that radio and newspaper coverage of the Los Gatos plane crash did not give the victims' names, but instead referred to them merely as \"deportees\".  Guthrie lived in New York City at the time, and none of the deportees' names were printed in the January 29, 1948, New York Times report, only those of the flight crew and the security guard. However, the local newspaper, The Fresno Bee, covered the tragedy extensively and listed all of the known names of the deportees.Unaware of the extensive local coverage of the disaster, Guthrie responded with a poem, which, when it was first written, featured only rudimentary musical accompaniment, with Guthrie chanting the song rather than singing it. In the poem, Guthrie assigned symbolic names to the dead: \"Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita; adi\u00f3s, mis amigos, Jes\u00fas y Mar\u00eda...\"  A decade later, Guthrie's poem was set to music and given a haunting melody by a schoolteacher named Martin Hoffman.  Shortly after, folk singer Pete Seeger, a friend of Woody Guthrie, began performing the song at concerts, and it was Seeger's rendition that popularized the song during this time.It has been suggested by the Three Rocks Research website that, in fact, \"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\" betrays Guthrie's lack of understanding regarding the Bracero Program. The program was a series of laws and diplomatic agreements created by the U.S. Congress in 1942, that permitted Mexican farm laborers (or Braceros) to work in the United States due to the severe labor shortages caused by World War II.  Under the terms of the program, the labor contractors were expected to provide transportation to and from the Mexican border, with the U.S. Immigration Service being required to repatriate the Mexican citizens if the contractor defaulted.  As such, the \"deportation\" of Braceros in this fashion was simply a way of meeting the obligations of the program\u2014although some newspapers, e.g., the New York Times, did refer to the braceros as \"deportees\".  However, the presence in the song of the lines, \"Some of us are illegal, and some are not wanted/Our work contract's out and we have to move on.\" suggests that Guthrie did in fact understand the workings of the Bracero Program. Furthermore, it could be argued that Guthrie's song is less about the program itself and more a comment on the attitude of American society and the media towards the Mexican farm laborers.\nIn addition to being a lament for the braceros killed in the crash, the opening lines of \"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\":\n\nare another protest by Guthrie.  At the time, government policies paid farmers to destroy their crops in order to keep farm production low and prices high.  Guthrie felt that it was wrong to render food inedible by poisoning it in a world where hungry people lived.\n\"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\" has been described by journalist Joe Klein as \"the last great song he [Guthrie] would write, a memorial to the nameless migrants 'all scattered like dry leaves' in Los Gatos Canyon\".

In 1979 he was invited to serve in the Orthodox Church in America by Metropolitan Theodosius (Lazor). L'Huillier accepted and was installed as Bishop of Brooklyn that year. Two years later, he succeeded Metropolitan Theodosius as Bishop of New York and New Jersey. In 1990 he  was elevated to the rank of archbishop.The author of several books, L'Huillier's final volume spurred some disagreements in Orthodox circles. Published by St. Vladimir's Press, it urged the Orthodox Churches to adopt the Western Christian calculation of Easter, aka Paschalion. This has been a controversial topic for some time in Eastern Orthodox discourse. Some critics of the book emphasized that only the Eastern Paschalion holds to the Nicene Council's 4th century prohibition on celebrating the resurrection before the Jewish Passover. Some argued that abandonment of that stipulation could even imply a subtle subtext of antisemitism, since it would further decouple the connection between Christianity and Judaism. This criticism is made on both historical and contemporary grounds, the latter because Western Christianity annually ignores contemporary Jews' calculation of Passover.\nSubsequent to L'Huillier's retirement from the episcopate in 2005, the Diocese of New York and New Jersey was combined with the Diocese of Washington (D.C.) to create the Diocese of Washington and New York.\nBoth during his episcopate and subsequent to his retirement, L'Huillier taught canon law at Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary.\nL'Huillier died in Bronxville, New York on November 19, 2007.

Here they were placed in the care of Baroness Franziska von B\u00fclow, member of the prominent B\u00fclow family, whose son Hans was Liszt's most outstanding pupil; he would take charge of the girls' musical education while Frau von B\u00fclow supervised their general and moral welfare. Hans von B\u00fclow, born in 1830, had abandoned his legal education after hearing Liszt conduct the premiere of Wagner's Lohengrin at Weimar in August 1850, and had decided to dedicate his life to music. After a brief spell conducting in small opera houses, B\u00fclow studied with Liszt, who was convinced that he would become a great concert pianist. B\u00fclow was quickly impressed by Cosima's own skill as a pianist, in which he saw the stamp of her father, and the pair developed romantic feelings for each other. Liszt approved the match, and the marriage took place at St. Hedwig's Cathedral, Berlin, on 18 August 1857. During their honeymoon, along with Liszt they visited Wagner at his home near Zurich. This visit was repeated the following year, when Cosima, on taking her leave, shocked Wagner with an emotional demonstration: \"[S]he fell at my feet, covered my hands with tears and kisses ... I pondered the mystery, without being able to solve it\".\nCosima, a Parisian by upbringing, found it hard to adjust to life in Berlin, which was then a more provincial city than Paris. Her attempts to mix with local society, according to Marie zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, were handicapped by \"[h]er exaggerated self-esteem and innate causticity\", which alienated the men and women in her circle. At least initially, Cosima took an interest in her husband's career, encouraging him to extend his activities into composition. On one occasion she provided him with a scenario she had written for an opera based on the story of Merlin, court magician to King Arthur. However, nothing came of this project. B\u00fclow's crowded professional schedule left Cosima alone for long periods, during which she worked for the French-language magazine Revue germanique as a translator and contributor. In December 1859 she was saddened by the death of her brother Daniel, at the age of twenty, after a long wasting illness. Cosima's first child, a daughter born on 12 October 1860, was named Daniela in Daniel's memory. A further, unexpected blow for Cosima fell in September 1862, when her sister Blandine, who had shared much of her upbringing, died in childbirth\u2014she had been married to \u00c9mile Ollivier, a Parisian lawyer, since October 1857. Cosima's second daughter, born in March 1863, was named Blandine Elisabeth Veronica Theresia.B\u00fclow was committed to Wagner's music; in 1858 he had undertaken the preparation of a vocal score for Tristan und Isolde, and by 1862 he was making a fair copy of Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. A social relationship developed, and during the summer of 1862 the B\u00fclows stayed with Wagner at the composer's home at Biebrich. Wagner records that Cosima became \"transfigured\" by his rendering of \"Wotan's Farewell\" from Die Walk\u00fcre. In October 1862, just after Blandine's death, Wagner and B\u00fclow shared conducting duties at a concert in Leipzig; Wagner records that, during a rehearsal, \"I felt utterly transported by the sight of Cosima ... she appeared to me as if stepping from another world\". In these years Wagner's emotional life was in disarray. He was still married to his first wife, Minna Planer (she was to die in 1866), and was involved in several extramarital relationships. On 28 November 1863 Wagner visited Berlin; while B\u00fclow was rehearsing a concert, Wagner and Cosima took a long cab ride through Berlin and declared their feelings for each other: \"with tears and sobs\", Wagner later wrote, \"we sealed our confession to belong to each other alone\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

His designs employed vivid colors, bold prints and sexy cuts, which were a refreshing contrast to the prevailing taste for muted colors and simplicity. His aesthetic, which \"combined luxurious classicism with overt sexuality\", attracted much criticism in addition to praise. He is quoted as saying, \"I don't believe in good taste\", which was reflected in his \"brazen defiance of the rules of fashion\". A saying referencing Versace's rivalry with Giorgio Armani was: \"Armani dresses the wife, Versace dresses the mistress.\"From 1978, Versace built the company with the support of his family, employing his sister Donatella as vice president and his brother Santo as president of the company. Donatella's purview extended to creative oversight, where she acted as a key consultant to Versace. Gianni would also come to employ Donatella's husband, Paul Beck, as menswear director.Among Versace's most famous innovations was his 1982 invention of a type of super-light chainmail called 'Oroton', which became a signature material in his outfits. His suits were inspired more by his experience in female tailoring, departing from masculine Savile Row models by crafting suits that accentuated the male form and \"insisted on men as sex objects.\"Versace was very proud of his southern Italian heritage and infused his designs with motifs inspired by historical fashion and art movements, especially Graeco-Roman art. This is evident in the company's logo, the Medusa Head, and recurring motifs like the Greek key. He also allowed his love for contemporary art to inspire his work, creating graphic prints based on the art of Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol.In 1982, Versace expanded the business into jewelry and housewares, designing luxury furnishings, china and textiles for the home. He was unusual in retaining complete creative control over all aspects of his company. In 1984 and '85, he contributed a specially appointed Gianni Versace Edition to the Mark VII line of US luxury automaker Lincoln. In 1989, the firm expanded into haute couture with the launch of Atelier Versace. Versace became known for employing celebrities in his marketing campaigns and seating them in the front rows of his fashion shows, the first to do so. He is also credited with inventing the supermodel vogue of the 1990s, by discovering and featuring major supermodels like Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington and Linda Evangelista, all of whom he featured both on the runway and in advertisement campaigns.\nAt the time of his death, Versace's empire was valued at $807 million and included 130 boutiques across the world.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Between the ages of 8 and 9, he showed precocious talent in the fields of music, poetry and painting. In 1913 he met the Futurists.\nHis attraction to the latest innovations was expressed in almost completely Futurist forms in his drawings, while he developed a unique style in his painting that was a mixture of Art Nouveau, Fauvism, Expressionism and Orphism. It was not until 1917, after meeting with Giacomo Balla in Rome, and with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in Naples (who later enthusiastically praised Conti's book Imbottigliature which was about to be printed) that Conti became part of the Futurist movement. His contribution to the movement was not only his literary works but also the paintings and drawings he produced between 1917 and 1919\u2014the years in which his work was taking on the metaphysical style.\nThe 1920s were a complex period for Conti. He explored Mannerism, Exoticism, Pittura Metafisica, and great historical and religious painting, covering a vast area that can be compared with his keen interest in the theatrical and literary world of Luigi Pirandello, Massimo Bontempelli and Enrico Pea, which led him to found the Viareggio Prize in 1929.\nThe 1930s brought a series of alternating events that created problems in his private life and led to his celebrative paintings. The decade also saw his enforced adhesion to Fascism (joining the Partito Nazionale Fascista), and his inner rebellion against it which transpired from his refusal to join Margherita Sarfatti's Novecento Italiano group and from other episodes when he stepped out of line. New prospects were only opened up to him when he became involved in designing stage sets for the opera house with the foundation of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino.\nBy the 1940s, long before the official rediscovery (20 years later) of the Futurist movement, Conti was again working on Futurist subjects and experiments. From 1948 to 1963 he followed the rules of the Order of the Franciscans, though he still continued to paint.\nMany of his works are housed in the Museo Primo Conti (Primo Conti Foundation Museum [1]) in the Villa le Coste at Fiesole (near Florence).", "hasanswer": true}]}

Ray Lankester. While recognizing the importance of comparative embryology in the study of descent, Gegenbaur laid stress on the higher value of comparative anatomy as the basis of the study of homologies, i.e. of the relations between corresponding parts in different animals, as, for example, the arm of man, with the foreleg of a horse, and with the wing of a fowl. A distinctive piece of work was effected by him in 1871 in supplementing the evidence adduced by Huxley in refutation of the skull-vertebrae theory: the theory of the origin of the skull from expanded vertebrae, which, formulated independently by Goethe and Oken, had been championed by Owen. Huxley demonstrated that the skull is built up of cartilaginous pieces; Gegenbaur showed that in the lowest (gristly) fishes, where hints of the original vertebrae might be most expected, the skull is an unsegmented gristly brain-box, and that in higher forms, the vertebral nature of the skull cannot be maintained, since many of the bones, notably those along the top of the skull, arise in the skin.In 1858, the physician Ernst Haeckel studied under Gegenbaur at Jena, receiving a doctorate in zoology (after his medical degree), and became a professor at the same institution, the University of Jena.  Ernst Haeckel expanded on the ideas of Gegenbaur while advocating the concepts of Charles Darwin.\nIn 1861, he published \"Ueber den Bau und die Entwickelung der Wirbelthier-Eier mit partielleer Dotterbildung\" (\"Proof that the ovum is unicellular in all vertebrates\", Arch.

He did graduate work at Strasbourg and then studied under the chemist Wilhelm Ostwald at Leipzig, from which he was granted a PhD in 1893.  He worked at the USDA Bureau of Soils from 1902 to 1906 as a soil physicist. He worked at the (US) National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST) 1906\u20131937. His fields of expertise included soil physics, gas properties, acoustics, fluid mechanics, and blackbody radiation.  He is also the originator of the Buckingham \u03c0 theorem in the field of dimensional analysis.In 1923, Buckingham published a report which voiced skepticism that jet propulsion would be economically competitive with prop driven aircraft at low altitudes and at the speeds of that period.Buckingham's first work on soil physics is on soil aeration, particularly the loss of carbon dioxide from the soil and its subsequent replacement by oxygen. From his experiments he found that the rate of gas diffusion in soil was not dependent significantly on the soil structure, compactness or water content of the soil. Using an empirical formula based on his data, Buckingham was able to give the diffusion coefficient as a function of air content. This relation is still commonly cited in many modern textbooks and used in modern research. The outcomes of his research on gas transport were to conclude that the exchange of gases in soil aeration takes place by diffusion and is sensibly independent of the variations of the outside barometric pressure.\nBuckingham then worked on soil water, research for which he is now renowned. Buckingham's work on soil water is published in Bulletin 38 USDA Bureau of Soils: Studies on the movement of soil moisture, which was released in 1907. This document contained three sections, the first of which looked at evaporation of water from below a layer of soil. He found that soils of various textures could strongly inhibit evaporation, particularly where capillary flow through the uppermost layers was prevented. The second section of Bulletin 38 looked at the drying of soils under arid and humid conditions. Buckingham found evaporative losses were initially higher from the arid soil, then after three days the evaporation under arid conditions became less than under humid conditions, with the total loss ending up greater from the humid soil. Buckingham believed this occurred due to the self-mulching behaviour (he referred to it as the soil forming a natural mulch) exhibited by the soil under arid conditions.\nThe third section of Bulletin 38 contains the work on unsaturated flow and capillary action for which Buckingham is famous. He firstly recognized the importance of the potential of the forces arising from interactions between soil and water. He called this the capillary potential, this is now known as the moisture or water potential (matric potential). He combined capillary theory and an energy potential in soil physics theory, and was the first to expound the dependence of soil hydraulic conductivity on capillary potential. This dependence later came to be known as relative permeability in petroleum engineering. He also applied a formula equivalent to Darcy's law to unsaturated flow.", "hasanswer": true}]}

His family had a soap-making business in the town. After he finished his secondary education at the Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium, he worked briefly as a volunteer at a newspaper in Cannstatt. He then studied German, art history, comparative literature, theater, and journalism at the universities of T\u00fcbingen, Munich, Halle, and Leipzig, receiving his doctorate in 1938 from Leipzig University.Bayer served as a reserve lieutenant in the German army, the Wehrmacht, from 1938. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, in the autumn of 1939, he applied to, and eventually, in the autumn of 1940, was accepted into the army's propaganda troops, the PK (Propagandakompanien), which were under the command of the Wehrmachtpropaganda department of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (the army's supreme command), and politically controlled by the Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. At their peak the PK comprised some 30 companies and 15,000 soldiers with backgrounds as journalists, photographers, artists, and film and radio personnel, who were charged with the task of recording their experiences and observations on the front in a form suitable for dissemination in the Nazi-controlled media.After a three-month training period, in Potsdam, Bayer served as a PK reporter from 1941 to 1945. He was stationed at first in Poland, in January 1941, and in June his unit moved to the Soviet Union, on the Eastern Front. A report he wrote on the Warsaw Ghetto, which he visited a number of times, was used as the text for a photo essay published in the Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung. Much of his work was published in military newspapers, including reports from the Soviet Union about the daily life of the German soldiers, and the impoverished condition of the Russian population. He also wrote feature articles, including humorous and satirical pieces. After a sojourn in southern Germany and Berlin from the end of 1942 to August 1943, he was assigned to a different PK unit and served as editor of the army newspaper Der Sieg (The Victory) through its closure in early 1945, part of the time while based in Warsaw.In his postwar life, Bayer avoided reference to his career as a PK war correspondent; decades later he stated obliquely that he looked back \"with deep shame\" on what he had seen and experienced in the war.Bayer spent the end of the war in an English prisoner-of-war camp in Putlos, in the vicinity of Oldenburg in Holstein, in spring to summer 1945, and while there directed the camp's theatre. Later that year, he married the journalist Elfriede Berger. The couple had one daughter but divorced a few years later. He then married another journalist, Susanne Ulrici Bayer, and had two more daughters.\nAfter the war, Bayer worked as a journalist and co-founded with comedian Werner Finck, Das Wespennest (The Wasp's Nest), Germany's first post-war satirical magazine. (The magazine ceased publication in 1949.) Bayer was a correspondent for Der Spiegel from 1947 to 1951, but during that time he also began a career as a free-lance writer. He adopted the pseudonym \"Thadd\u00e4us Troll\" in 1948, the name under which he is primarily known and chosen because he wanted his books to be on library shelves near those of his role model Kurt Tucholsky.In the ensuing years he published prolifically\u2014poems, plays, novels, short-stories, theatre criticism, and satirical essays\u2014often written in Swabian dialect. He also wrote scripts for the D\u00fcsseldorf cabaret Kom(m)\u00f6dchen, articles on wine and cookery, and a sex education book in Swabian on the model of Peter Mayle's Where Did I Come From?. His poetry was based on everyday life but had a political dimension in common with many post-war German poets. According to Wolfgang Beutin writing in A History of German Literature, Troll's playful linguistic use of dialect was simultaneously a \"confrontation with social convention and a criticism of social rigidity,\" a trait akin to concrete poetry and one which he shared with the Franconian dialect poet Fitzgerald Kusz.Although he was a supporter of the Social Democrat politicians Gustav Heinemann and Willy Brandt, Troll's approach to politics was essentially non-partisan and, like his poetry, was often playful. In 1950 he became one of the founding members of Werner Finck's Radikale Mitte (Radical Middle) party. Describing themselves as an \"Association for Combating the Deadly Seriousness of the Time\" and a \"Parody Party\", they were in favour of radicalism but opposed to extremism of both the Left and the Right. The party's symbol was a safety pin. In his later years Troll was an active campaigner for libraries and for support, pension rights, and fair publishing contracts for authors. He was one of the founders of the F\u00f6rderkreis deutscher Schriftsteller, an organization that supports and sponsors writers in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and served as its first chairman from 1968 to 1977. He also served on the executive councils and committees of Verband deutscher Schriftsteller (General Association of German Writers) and S\u00fcddeutschen Rundfunk (South German Radio). In 1978 he was elected vice-president of the German branch of PEN International.After a lengthy and severe depression, Thadd\u00e4us Troll committed suicide in his Stuttgart apartment with an overdose of sleeping pills on 5 July 1980. He was 66 years old and had planned his own funeral before his death. At his wake the mourners were served his favourite dumplings and Trollinger wine. A Dixieland band accompanied him to his grave in the Steigfriedhof cemetery in Bad-Cannstatt. He specified no lengthy graveside sermons, only the Lord's Prayer and a reading of his self-written obituary. In the year following his death, the F\u00f6rderkreis deutscher Schriftsteller established a literary award in his honour, the Thadd\u00e4us-Troll-Preis. That same year, Hoffmann & Campe published a posthumous anthology of his writings, Das gro\u00dfe Thadd\u00e4us Troll-Lesebuch, which included Troll's self-written obituary.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He stopped the payment shortly after he ascended the throne, which led to a prolonged war with Henry's successor King Otto. In 935, Boleslaus attacked the Thuringian allies of the Saxons in the northwest and defeated two of Otto's armies (from Thuringia and Merseburg). The war then deteriorated to border raids (the general pattern of warfare in this region at the time) and reached its conclusion in 950, when King Otto besieged a castle owned by Boleslaus's son. This prompted Boleslaus to sign a peace treaty with Otto. Although he remained undefeated, he promised to resume the payment of tribute.\nFive years later, the armies of the Czechs and Germans allied against the Magyars in the victorious Battle of Lechfeld on 10 August 955. After the battle, the remainder of the huge Magyar army turned to Bohemia, where it was crushed by Boleslaus. Shortly afterwards, in October, he also helped Otto to crush an uprising of Slavic tribes led by the Obotrite princes Nakon and Stojgn\u011bv on the Lower Elbe river in the Battle on the Raxa.\nThe defeat of invading Hungarians brought the same benefits to both Germans and Czechs. Less obvious is what Boleslaus expected to gain from his participation in Otto's war against the Obotrite princes in the far north. He probably wanted to ensure that his powerful German neighbors did not interfere with him in expanding the Bohemian territories to the east.\nAs a result of the victory, Boleslaus freed the Moravian lands from Magyar raids and expanded his territory, which in turn was later conquered by Polish dukes and became known as Upper Silesia and Lesser Poland. By occupying the city of Krak\u00f3w, he controlled important trade routes from Prague to Kiev and Lviv. To defuse the Bohemian-Polish conflict, Duke Boleslav married his daughter Doubravka to the pagan Piast prince Mieszko I in 963/964, and helped bring Christianity to Poland. He even allied with Mieszko in the campaign against the Saxon count Wichmann the Younger.\nAccording to the medieval chronicler Cosmas of Prague, Duke Boleslaus died on 15 July 967, a date questioned by recent research.

He was introduced to anthroposophy through his classmate, Walter Johannes Stein (1891-1957). In 1914, he first attended lectures given by Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. Consequently, he became a member of the Anthroposophical Society, and in 1920 was invited as an instructor to the newly established Waldorf School at Stuttgart by Emil Molt (1876-1936).\nKolisko specialized in preventative medicine, and at the Waldorf School he worked with other teachers in creating a curriculum that focused on the spiritual and physical development of school children. He was instrumental in construction of several artistic therapies, such as anthroposophic music therapy and eurythmy.

As an excellent skier, he won both the downhill and the 10 km cross country disciplines, but lagged behind in shooting, fencing and horse riding. He finished third overall and won the bronze medal. Fellow countrymen Lindh and Grut took the first and second place respectively.Since the winter pentathlon would have no other appearances at the Olympic Games, Haase turned to the modern pentathlon. He was selected for the 1956 Summer Olympics and finished 17th individually. In the team contest Sweden was the favourite as it included Bj\u00f6rn Thofelt and the individual Olympic champion Lars Hall. In the first event, horse riding, Thofelt had drawn the lot for a very peculiar horse and eventually suffered from a concussion, after he fell off twice and had to withdraw.

These gangs were composed of nativist White Anglo-Saxon Protestants who were opposed to enfranchisement of the growing number of Irish Catholic refugees from the Great Famine. Street gangs, like the Bowery Boys, \"were bound by ethnic ties or nativist belief; the members tended to be deeply patriotic, and a common thread was the belief that the country was pretty well full, so that newcomers were not welcomed.\" Poole's gang was located near to the Five Points neighborhood, where many recent Irish Catholic immigrants settled. Five Points was located in what is now Chinatown in Lower Manhattan. Waves of Irish- and German-Americans moved into the Five Points as their first stop on the way to the American dream. In response to attacks by Poole and his followers, the Irish created their own street gangs. The Dead Rabbits were an Irish-membership gang and the biggest rival of Poole's Bowery Boys.

This provoked Burke into writing his first published work, A Vindication of Natural Society: A View of the Miseries and Evils Arising to Mankind, appearing in Spring 1756. Burke imitated Bolingbroke's style and ideas in a reductio ad absurdum of his arguments for deistic rationalism in order to demonstrate their absurdity.\nBurke claimed that Bolingbroke's arguments against revealed religion could apply to all social and civil institutions as well. Lord Chesterfield and Bishop Warburton as well as others initially thought that the work was genuinely by Bolingbroke rather than a satire. All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke's quality of writing. Some reviewers failed to notice the ironic nature of the book which led to Burke stating in the preface to the second edition (1757) that it was a satire.Richard Hurd believed that Burke's imitation was near-perfect and that this defeated his purpose, arguing that an ironist \"should take care by a constant exaggeration to make the ridicule shine through the Imitation. Whereas this Vindication is everywhere enforc'd, not only in the language, and on the principles of L. Bol., but with so apparent, or rather so real an earnestness, that half his purpose is sacrificed to the other\". A minority of scholars have taken the position that in fact Burke did write the Vindication in earnest, later disowning it only for political reasons.In 1757, Burke published a treatise on aesthetics titled A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful that attracted the attention of prominent Continental thinkers such as Denis Diderot and Immanuel Kant. It was his only purely philosophical work, completed in 1753. When asked by Sir Joshua Reynolds and French Laurence to expand it thirty years later, Burke replied that he was no longer fit for abstract speculation.On 25 February 1757, Burke signed a contract with Robert Dodsley to write a \"history of England from the time of Julius Caesar to the end of the reign of Queen Anne\", its length being eighty quarto sheets (640 pages), nearly 400,000 words. It was to be submitted for publication by Christmas 1758. Burke completed the work to the year 1216 and stopped; it was not published until after Burke's death, in an 1812 collection of his works, An Essay Towards an Abridgement of the English History. G. M. Young did not value Burke's history and claimed that it was \"demonstrably a translation from the French\". On commenting on the story that Burke stopped his history because David Hume published his, Lord Acton said \"it is ever to be regretted that the reverse did not occur\".During the year following that contract, Burke founded with Dodsley the influential Annual Register, a publication in which various authors evaluated the international political events of the previous year. The extent to which Burke contributed to the Annual Register is unclear. In his biography of Burke, Robert Murray quotes the Register as evidence of Burke's opinions, yet Philip Magnus in his biography does not cite it directly as a reference. Burke remained the chief editor of the publication until at least 1789 and there is no evidence that any other writer contributed to it before 1766.On 12 March 1757, Burke married Jane Mary Nugent (1734\u20131812), daughter of Dr. Christopher Nugent, a Catholic physician who had provided him with medical treatment at Bath. Their son Richard was born on 9 February 1758 while an elder son, Christopher, died in infancy. Burke also helped raise a ward, Edmund Nagle (later Admiral Sir Edmund Nagle), the son of a maternal cousin orphaned in 1763.At about this same time, Burke was introduced to William Gerard Hamilton (known as \"Single-speech Hamilton\"). When Hamilton was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, Burke accompanied him to Dublin as his private secretary, a position he held for three years. In 1765, Burke became private secretary to the liberal Whig politician Charles, Marquess of Rockingham, then Prime Minister of Great Britain, who remained Burke's close friend and associate until his death in 1782.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Among the fastest baserunners of his generation of Negro leaguers, his most remarkable season was his 1929 campaign, in which he batted .330 while hitting 24 doubles and stealing 23 bases in a typically abbreviated Negro league season.\nLike the comparable Judy Johnson, he was a remarkable fielder, arguably the best fielding second baseman of any race from the 1920s through the 1940s, and was at his best in pressure situations. Unlike Johnson, Newt Allen is not in the Hall of Fame, although many experts regard him as having been superior to many white inductees. Allen did make the list of 39 finalists for the 2006 special Negro leagues and Pre-Negro leagues Election, but was not one of the 17 finally chosen.\nNewt Allen is also listed on the second team of a 1952 Pittsburgh Courier Poll of the Greatest Black Players.Allen died at age 87 in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nKnown statistics: .293 career batting average, 16 home runs, 640 games.", "hasanswer": true}]}

By his own account, he started photography at fifteen in 1907 and it is likely that he contacted the Estonian National Museum (ERM) in 1912, having already taken photographs in various places in Estonia.In 1913, P\u00e4\u00e4suke began a project for the ERM to document Estonia's lands, trades and architecture through photography and the collection of artifacts.\n\nA major part of this project was a tour P\u00e4\u00e4suke made with an assistant, Harri Volter, to the Estonian coast, from 10 June to 29 July 1913.

She began studying piano with Frank Marshall at the age of three, and later in life served as Director of his school, the Marshall Academy. Both her parents were pianists and she was the niece of pianists. She gave her first public performance at the age of five at the International Exposition in Barcelona. She performed her first concert at the age of six at the World's Fair in Seville in 1929, and had her orchestral debut at the age of eleven. By 1943, her performances were selling out in Spain. She began touring internationally in 1947, and in 1954 toured North America with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. In 1966, she engaged in a first tour of Southern Africa which proved so wildly popular that three further tours were completed In 1969, de Larrocha performed in Boston for the Peabody Mason Concert series.De Larrocha, writes Jed Distler, \"started composing at age seven and continued on and off until her 30th year, with a prolific spurt in her late teens,\" and while she never performed her works in public, she gave her family the choice of making them available after her death, which they have done.De Larrocha made numerous recordings of the solo piano repertoire and in particular the works of composers of her native Spain. She is best known for her recordings of the music of Manuel de Falla, Enrique Granados, Federico Mompou, and Isaac Alb\u00e9niz, as well as her 1967 recordings of Antonio Soler's keyboard sonatas. She recorded for Hispavox, CBS/Columbia/Epic, BMG/RCA and London/Decca, winning her first Grammy Award in 1975 and her last one in 1992, at the age of almost seventy. She received the Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts in 1994.De Larrocha spoke in a 1978 interview with Contemporary Keyboard,\nI don't believe there is a 'best' of anything in this life. I would say, though, that Granados was one of the great Spanish composers, and that, in my opinion, he was the only one that captured the real Romantic flavor. His style was aristocratic, elegant and poetic \u2013 completely different from Falla and Alb\u00e9niz. To me, each of them is a different world. Falla was the one who really captured the spirit of the Gypsy music. And Alb\u00e9niz, I think was more international than the others. Even though his music is Spanish in flavor, his style is completely Impressionistic.\nLess than five feet tall and with small hands for a pianist, spanning an interval of barely a tenth on the keyboard, in her younger years she was nonetheless able to tackle all the big concertos (all five by Beethoven, Liszt's No. 1, Brahms's No. 2, Rachmaninoff's Nos. 2 and 3, both of Ravel's, and those of Prokofiev, Bart\u00f3k, Bliss and Khachaturian, and many more), as well as the wide spans demanded by the music of Granados, Alb\u00e9niz, and de Falla. She had a \"long fifth finger\" and a \"wide stretch between thumb and index finger\" which enhanced her technical ability.\"She made her first recordings, of Chopin, at age nine, her feet not yet able to reach the pedals\" and was considered a great interpreter of Chopin.\nAs she grew older she began to play a different style of music; more Mozart and Beethoven were featured in her recitals and she became a regular guest at the \"Mostly Mozart Festival\" of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York. In 2001, she was named Honorary Member of the Foundation for Iberian Music at The City University of New York. De Larrocha retired from public performance in October 2003, aged 80, following a 76-year career.Alicia de Larrocha died on 25 September 2009 in Quiron Hospital, Barcelona, aged 86.

He was the founder of both the Missionaries of Saint Charles (also known as the Scalabrinians) and the Mission Sisters of Saint Charles.Scalabrini's rise to the rank of bishop came at a rapid pace due to a series of lectures he gave on the First Vatican Council in 1872 and his staunch dedication to catechism, which led Pope Pius IX to dub him the \"Apostle of the Catechism\"; successive popes Leo XIII and Pius X held him in high esteem and both failed to convince him to accept appointments as head of an archdiocese or as a cardinal. He made five pastoral visits across his diocese which proved to be an exhaustive but effective mission of evangelization and his efforts at reforming seminaries and pastoral initiatives earned him praise even from the secular detractors who criticized him for his strict obedience to the pope.His tenure as bishop resulted in the establishment of the \"Saint Raphael Association\" dedicated to the care of Italian migrants. This solidified through the actions of his twin religious congregations and his visits to both Brazil and the United States, where he went to meet Italian immigrants. He also dealt with the Paolo Miraglia-Gulotti schism that took place in his diocese and had known the faux-bishop after ordaining him in 1879. Scalabrini also held three important episcopal gatherings in his diocese that revitalized parish and diocesan practices and made his diocese the ground for the first-ever National Catechetical Congress in 1899; he was in the process of planning another before his death that was later celebrated in 1910.Scalabrini's holiness was renowned across the Italian peninsula and there were countless who attested to his saintliness in an ensuing canonization process; his first title at the outset of the process was that of a Servant of God that Pope Pius XI bestowed upon him on 30 June 1926 while the confirmation of his heroic virtue allowed for Pope John Paul II to title him as Venerable on 16 March 1987.

After practising some time at Nemours, he abandoned law, took holy orders, and was appointed tutor to one of Richelieu's nephews, the duc de Fronsac. This patronage secured for him the abbeys of Aubignac and of Mainac. The death of the duc de Fronsac in 1646 put an end to hopes of further preferment, and Ambroise Par\u00e9d'Aubignac retired to Nemours, occupying himself with literature till his death.He energetically participated in the literary controversies of his time. Against Gilles M\u00e9nage he wrote T\u00e9rence justifi\u00e9 (1656); he laid claim to having originated the idea of the Carte de tendre of Mlle de Scud\u00e9ry's Cl\u00e9li\u00e9; and after being a professed admirer of Corneille, he turned against Corneille for having neglected to mention the abb\u00e9 in his Discours sur le po\u00e8me dramatique. He was the author of four tragedies: La Cyminde (1642), La Pucelle d'Orl\u00e9ans (1642), Z\u00e9nobie (1647) and Le Martyre de Sainte Catherine (1650). Z\u00e9nobie was written with the intention of affording a model in which the strict rules of the drama, as understood by the theorists, were served.In choosing subjects for his plays, d'Aubignac seems to have been guided by a desire to illustrate the various kinds of tragedy\u2014patriotic, antique and religious themes. In return, the dramatic authors whom he was in the habit of criticizing were quick to take advantage of the opportunity for retaliation offered by the production of these plays.It is as a theorist that d'Aubignac is still remembered. The credit of having been the first to play so large a part in the history of the French stage belongs to Jean Chapelain; but the laws of dramatic method and construction generally were codified by d'Aubignac in his Pratique du th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The book was only published in 1657, but he had begun writing it under Richelieu's urging as early as 1640.\nHis Conjectures acad\u00e9miques ou dissertation sur l'Iliade d'Hom\u00e8re, which was not published until nearly forty years after his death, threw doubts on the existence of Homer, and anticipated in some sense the conclusions of Friedrich August Wolf in his Prolegomena ad Homerum (1795).The contents of the Pratique du th\u00e9\u00e2tre were summarized by Ferdinand Bruneti\u00e8re in his notice of d'Aubignac in the Grande Encyclop\u00e9die.

Burri is enormously important in that postwar period and influential internationally... I don't think there would have been an Antoni T\u00e0pies in Spain had there not been Burri.\nAlberto Burri was born on 12 March 1915 in Citt\u00e0 di Castello, in Umbria to Pietro Burri, a tuscan wine merchant, and Carolina Torreggiani, an umbrian elementary school teacher. In 1935, Burri attended a government High school in Arezzo living as a boarder in a pension, and as his school reports noted, he studied Classics on a private school in Citt\u00e0 di Castello. On his return from North Africa, Burri and his younger brother Vittorio were enrolled in the medical school in Perugia, and following his African adventure, Burri decided he wanted to specialize in tropical diseases. Burri graduated from medical school in 1940, and on 12 October that year, two days after Italy's entrance into World War II, with an precocious voluntary experience in the Italo-Ethiopian War, was then recalled into military service, and sent to Libya as a combat medic. Army records show that within 20 days of this order, Burri received a temporary discharge to allow him to complete his medical internship and gain the diploma to qualify as a medical doctor. Burri claimed he studied art history, because he wanted to be able to understand the works of art that surrounded him. He also studied Greek, a language in which he became proficient, and later in life was able to read and enjoy Classical Greek literature. On 8 May 1943 the unit he was part of was captured by the British in Tunisia and was later turned over to the Americans and transferred to Hereford, Texas in a prisoner-of-war camp housing around 3000 Italian officers, where he began painting. After his liberation in 1946, he moved to Rome and devoted himself exclusively to painting; his first solo exhibition took place at the La Margherita Gallery in 1947. He then exhibited at the Marlborough Gallery in New York and at the Gallery de France in Paris.\nPrevented from practicing his medical profession, Burri had the opportunity of choosing a leisure activity thanks to the YMCA Association. Using the limited amount of materials available in the camp he took on the activity of painting, at the age of almost 30 and without any kind of academic reference. Meanwhile, the tragic death of his younger brother Vittorio on the Russian front in 1943 had a strong impact on him. Shutting himself off from the rest of the world, and depicting figurative subjects on thick chromatic marks, he progressively realized the desire of abandoning the medical profession, in favor of painting.", "hasanswer": false}]}

There she met Parsons, who believed her to be the \"elemental\" woman that he had invoked in the early stages of a series of sex magic rituals called the Babalon Working.

After Parsons' death in an explosion at their home in 1952, Cameron came to suspect that her husband had been assassinated and began rituals to communicate with his spirit. Moving to Beaumont, she established a multi-racial occult group called The Children, which dedicated itself to sex magic rituals with the intent of producing mixed-race \"moon children\" who would be devoted to the god Horus. The group soon dissolved, largely because many of its members became concerned by Cameron's increasingly apocalyptic predictions.\nReturning to Los Angeles, Cameron befriended the socialite Samson De Brier and established herself within the city's avant-garde artistic community.

He supported the moderate coinage of silver and favored revision of the high protective tariff, but not to the extent that would make him support either the Morrison tariff bill of 1886 or the Mills tariff bill of 1888. In that respect, he stayed safely in the good graces of the national party, and beat Democratic challengers easily, even with Prohibition third party candidates carrying somewhere between three and ten percent of the vote in a congressional race. As a member of the Military Affairs Committee, he pushed through a bill to make provision for homes for disabled soldiers in every state in the Union. He also served on the Pensions committee. As one senator said later, \"No ex-soldier ever appealed to him in vain, and his generous nature could refuse nothing to the suffering or dependent.\" Breaking with other members of the Republican party, Laird strove to clear the name of General Fitz John Porter, who had been his old commanding general. \"There was in his voice the sound of the ring of the saber,\" Congressman Byron Cutcheon of Michigan commented, \"there was in his utterances the rattle of small arms in battle.\" Certainly one fellow congressman had cause to feel so that summer, when Laird took out a grievance by socking him in the mouth.He was re-elected three times serving from March 4, 1883, but after his re-election in 1888 had a nervous breakdown, complicated by insomnia; as a result, he never took his seat in the lame-duck session of the Fiftieth Congress and had no chance to attend the Congress that followed it. He died on August 17, 1889, in Hastings, aged 40. Laird is buried in Hastings' Parkview Cemetery.\nLaird is the namesake of the community of Laird, Colorado.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The province had only recently been added to the Aztec Empire through conquest, and when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s arrived in the region (now the Mexican state of Veracruz) in 1519, one of his first acts was to overthrow Aztec dominion by seizing Aztec tribute collectors in the town of Quiahuiztlan and only returning them after a personal request from the Aztec Emperor. He then routed the Aztec garrison at the town of Tizapancingo and returned the state to the native Totonacs under their leader Tlacochcalcatl of Cempoala.To restore the province to Aztec control, Moctezuma despatched Qualpopoca with instructions to defeat the Totonacs and their Spanish allies. Arriving in October 1519, Qualpopoca demanded that the Totonac towns pay their regular tribute to the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. The towns appealed to the Spanish garrisons at Villa Rica and Veracruz and Juan de Escalante, the conquistador then in command, warned Qualpopoca not to threaten the Totonacs and demanded gold as recompense. Qualpopoca took no notice and continued to organise reprisals against Totonac villages that had not paid tribute. Escalante counterattacked with an army of conquistadors and Totonac warriors and met Qualpopoca in a battle near Nauhtla.The battle was short, the Totonac forces routing early on and Escalante forced to withdraw under heavy attack, leaving Nauthla in flames.

After the Continuation War Virolainen moved to Lohja, but he remained one of the leaders of the evacuated Karelians, and never gave up the hope that Soviet Union and later Russia would return Finnish Karelia to Finland. After World War II Virolainen became the first president of the Maaseudun Nuorten Liitto later known as Finnish Centre Youth, which has been educating tens of ministers and hundreds of members of the Finnish Parliament.He was also famous as a teetotaller, saying that the only circumstance where he would countenance downing a toast would be if Karelia was ceded back to Finland. He was fond of repeating the line, and it has been claimed that he said it to, among others, Nikita Khrushchev and Anastas Mikoyan on the Soviet side, to fend off needling by them for lacking the Soviet style of social graces.\nA member of the Agrarian League (later the Centre Party), Virolainen was a Member of Parliament 1945\u20131983 and 1987\u20131991.He had a long ministerial career, serving as Assistant Minister of the Interior 1950\u20131951; Minister at the Council of State Chancellery 1951, and 1956\u20131957; Minister of Education 1953, 1954, 1956\u20131957, and 1968\u20131970; Minister of Foreign Affairs 1954\u20131956, 1957, and 1958; Deputy Prime Minister 1957, 1958, 1962\u20131963, 1968\u20131970, and 1977\u20131979; Minister of Agriculture 1961\u20131963; Minister of Finance 1972\u20131975; and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry 1976\u20131979.Virolainen was Prime Minister from 1964\u20131966, presiding over a coalition government comprising the Centre Party, National Coalition Party, Swedish People's Party, and Finnish People's Party. He also served as Speaker of the Parliament from 1966\u20131968 and 1979\u20131983. Virolainen is considered one of the strongest Centre Party leaders in the post-war era, second only to Urho Kekkonen.\nVirolainen had a variable, often tense relationship with President Kekkonen, who considered him an unreliable, too frequently opinion-changing politician (Juhani Suomi, \"A Ski Trail Being Snowed In:  Urho Kekkonen 1976-1981\" / Umpeutuva latu.  Urho Kekkonen 1976-1981, Helsinki:  Otava Publishing Ltd., 2000).  Virolainen himself claimed that the two basic reasons for their tense relationship were that he had never been a member of the right-wing, nationalist Academic Karelia Society (Kekkonen had, until 1932), and that he was a teetotaller (Kekkonen drank and at times smoked).  Moreover, Kekkonen was unconvinced that Virolainen always supported his official foreign policy toward the Soviet Union.  In June 1979, he publicly rebuked Virolainen, who was then Speaker of Parliament, for \"bearing a false testimony\" about Finland's foreign policy, and for harming Finland's international relations.  Shortly before this harsh accusation, Virolainen had suggested in an interview by the Suomen Kuvalehti magazine that the National Coalition Party had remained in the opposition despite its major victory in the 1979 parliamentary elections because of \"general reasons\" or foreign policy.\nAfter Kekkonen resigned in October 1981, Virolainen became the Centre Party's presidential candidate, but he was handily defeated in the 1982 presidential elections by the Social Democratic candidate, Mauno Koivisto.  In the 1983 parliamentary elections, Virolainen was one of the major-party deputies to lose their seats because of allegations that he had illegally received the parliamentary daily allowance for commuting between Helsinki and his official hometown.  Determined to finish his parliamentary career in style, he was re-elected to Parliament in the 1987 parliamentary elections.  During his last electoral term, Virolainen supported constitutional amendment proposals that reduced the President's power.During his nine-year retirement from Parliament, Virolainen still actively followed the Finnish political affairs and sometimes gave interviews on current topics (the Finnish broadcasting corporation YLE \"Living Archives\" / El\u00e4v\u00e4 arkisto, search words:  \"Johannes Virolainen\").  He also wrote some volumes of political memoirs, including \"A Defence of Politics\" (Politiikan puolustus), \"From the Path\" (Polun varrelta), and \"The Pictures Move\" (Kuvat kulkevat).", "hasanswer": true}]}

Mathieu was first apprenticed to a goldsmith in Venlo but soon gave up his apprenticeship to attend the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1806 he made his way, via Hamburg, to Saint Petersburg where he abode eight years, learning how to make wax models and sculptures of various kinds in the workshop of Joseph Camberlain. In 1815 he returned briefly to Venlo and Maastricht. He then spent several months at Girodet's studio in Paris, where his work was exhibited at the 1819 Salon.\nBeing determined to go to Rome, he was accepted as an apprentice of the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen, probably in 1818. In a competition for young artists, organized by Venetian sculptor Antonio Canova, Kessels in 1819 won the highest award with his terracotta Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows, a piece of frank and beautiful workmanship. In Rome he became a member, later professor of the Academy of St. Luke and of the Institute of the Netherlands. He also was a member of the academies in Amsterdam (from 1824 onwards) and Antwerp.\nIn Rome Kessels taught the Liege sculptors Louis Jehotte (c. 1803-84) and Eug\u00e8ne Simonis, who exerted an influence through their teaching at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels.

He was born a twin to Fadrique Alfonso, Lord of Haro, and was the first boy born to the couple that survived to adulthood.\nAt birth, he was adopted by Rodrigo \u00c1lvarez de las Asturias.  Rodrigo died the following year and Henry inherited his lordship of Nore\u00f1a.  His father later made him Count of Trast\u00e1mara and lord over Lemos and Sarria in Galicia, and the towns of Cabrera and Ribera, which constituted a large and important heritage in the northwest of the peninsula.  It made him the head of the new Trast\u00e1mara dynasty, arising from the main branch of Burgundy-Ivrea.\nWhile Alfonso XI lived, his lover Eleanor gave a great many titles and privileges to their sons.  This caused discontent among many of the noblemen and in particular the queen, Maria of Portugal, and her son, Peter.\nThey had a chance for revenge when Alfonso XI died unexpectedly from a fever in the siege of Gibraltar in March, 1350. They pushed Eleanor, her sons and their supporters aside, and Henry and his brothers fled and scattered.  They were fearful of what their brother, King Peter, could do to them.  The late king had not even been buried.\nAlthough Eleanor and her sons reached an agreement with Peter to live peacefully in his court, the situation remained unstable.  Henry and his brothers Fadrique, Tello and Sancho staged numerous rebellions against the new king.  Also, to strengthen his position and gain allies, Henry married Juana Manuel, the daughter of Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, adelantado mayor of Murcia and Lord of Villena, the most prosperous nobleman of the realm.  In 1351, the King took counsel from Juan Alfonso de Alburquerque, Mar\u00eda of Portugal's right-hand man.   He became convinced that his father's lover was the instigator of the uprisings, so he ordered Eleanor to be incarcerated and finally executed in Talavera de la Reina.\nAfter that, Henry fled to Portugal.  He was pardoned by Pedro and returned to Castile, then revolted in Asturias in 1352.  He reconciled with his brother, only to rebel against him again in a long, intermittent war, which ended with Henry's flight to France, where he entered the service of John II of France.\nShortly after, Henry and his men spent time in Peter IV of Aragon's army in their war against Castile (1358).  During that conflict, he was defeated and held prisoner in N\u00e1jera (1360). He was liberated (with the help of Juan Ram\u00edrez de Arellano, among others) and exiled himself to France once more.\nThen Peter IV of Aragon attacked Castile again. Henry agreed to help him on condition that he would lend his support to destroying his half-brother.  This became the Castilian Civil War.  The attack combined Henry's Castillian allies, the Aragonese and the French (a company of Bertrand du Guesclin's mercenaries, expelled by Peter of Castile, who had taken refuge in Guyenne).  Henry was proclaimed king in Calahorra (1366).  In return, he had to reward his allies with titles and riches for the help they had provided.  This earned him the nickname el de las mercedes  (\"mercedes being Spanish for \"mercies\").\nPeter of Castile fled north to Bordeaux, the capital of the English dominions in France, where Edward, the Black Prince held court. Edward agreed to help Peter recover his throne. Despite the fact that the army suffered so badly from dysentery that it is said that one out of every five Englishmen would not return home, on 3 April 1367 an Anglo-Gascon army, led by Edward and his younger brother, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, met the Castilian forces (supported by French mercenaries under Bertrand du Guesclin). Peter then defeated Henry in the Battle of N\u00e1jera, but Henry escaped and returned to France under the protection of Charles V of France. King Peter and Prince Edward parted ways over the funding of the expedition, and the Black Prince returned to Bordeaux, having contracted an illness on this expedition that would ail him until his death in 1376.\nThey reorganised their army at Peyrepertuse Castle.  Then, with the help of many Castilian rebels and Bertrand du Guesclin's Frenchmen, they defeated Peter at the Battle of Montiel on 14 March 1369.  Henry killed \"the Cruel King\", now a prisoner, with his own hand.  This definitively won him the Castilian throne and the name of Henry II.\nBefore being consolidated in his throne and being able to hand on power to his son John, Henry had to defeat Ferdinand I of Portugal.  He embarked on the three Ferdinand Wars.  Ferdinand's main ally in these wars was John of Gaunt, the husband of Peter's daughter Constance.  Henry was allied with Charles V of France. He put the Castilian navy at Charles' disposal and they played a key part in the siege of La Rochelle, and the Battle of La Rochelle where the admiral Ambrosio Boccanegra completely defeated the English side.\nHenry recompensed his allies, but he still had to defend his interests in the kingdom of Castile and Le\u00f3n.  Consequently, he denied the King of Aragon the territories that he had promised him in the difficult times.\nHenry then went to war against Portugal and England in the Hundred Years' War. For most of his reign he had to fight off the attempts of John of Gaunt, a son of Edward III of England, to claim the Castilian throne in right of Constance.  In his domestic policy he started to rebuild the kingdom, sped up the transformation of the royal administration; and held numerous courts.  He also permanently set up the Lordship of Biscay after the death of his brother Tello.  In foreign policy, he favoured France over England.\nHe died on 29 May 1379 in Santo Domingo de la Calzada.  His son John I of Castile succeeded him on the throne.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He later immersed himself in regular Talmudic study and rabbinical law in the Porat Yosef Yeshiva in Jerusalem's Old City, where he also studied Kabbalah with the Rosh Yeshivah, Rabbi Ezra Attiya, Rabbi Saliman Eliyahu (father of Sephardic Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu), and other learned rabbis.\nIn 1934, Rabbi Kaduri and his family moved to the Old City, where the Porat Yosef Yeshivah gave him an apartment nearby with a job of binding the yeshivah's books and copying over rare manuscripts in the yeshivah's library. The books remained in the yeshivah's library, while the copies of manuscripts were stored in Rabbi Kaduri's personal library. Before binding each book, he would study it intently, committing it to memory. He was reputed to have photographic memory and also mastered the Talmud by heart, including the adjoining Rashi and Tosafot commentaries.During the period of Arab-Israeli friction that led up to the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, the Porat Yosef Yeshivah was virtually turned into a fortress against frequent flashes of violence.

After the passing of the leading kabbalist, Rabbi Efraim Hakohen, in 1989, the remaining kabbalists appointed Rabbi Kaduri as their head.Rabbi Kaduri did not publish any of the works that he authored on Kabbalah; he allowed only students of Kabbalah to study them. He did publish some articles criticizing those who engage in \"practical Kabbalah\", the popular dissemination of advice or amulets, often for a price. Kadouri said \"It is forbidden to teach a non-Jew Kabbalah, not even Talmud, not even simple Torah;\" perhaps referring to pop celebrity Madonna's publicised interest in Kabbalah; he also said that women (even Jewish) are not allowed to study Kabbalah.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was the son and successor of Marinus I.\nAt the beginning of his reign, he warred against the Saracens and then made a treaty with them after they appeared beneath his walls in 929. He then allied with Lombards Atenulf III of Benevento, with whom he signed a pact, and Landulf I, joint-prince of Benevento, against the Byzantines. A Greek force was sent to Apulia and the rebellious vassals were constrained to recognise the authority of the emperor in Constantinople. John then confirmed a treaty with the princes salve fidelitate sanctorum imperatorum.\nIn 946, he allied with Landulf II of Benevento in an invasion of Salerno with the intent of deposing Prince Gisulf I. They were defeated by an army of Mastalus I of Amalfi and John retired to Naples. Landulf turned around and joined with Gisulf in attacking the Neapolitan duchy. They took Nola.\nIn 949, John made a donation to the church of Saints Severinus and Sossus, which had possibly been founded by one of his predecessors. In 950, he himself founded the church of Saint Michael Porta Nova in Naples. In 955, he attempted again to throw off the imperial yoke and again an army was sent to Italy under the strategos of Calabria and Langobardia, Marianos Argyros. Refused entry into Naples, it landed in the harbour and pillaged the city, forcing John to submit. In 962, however, John switched his allegiance to the new emperor in the West, Otto I. In 958, Naples was subject to another Muslim siege.\nJohn's wife was the Roman senatrix Theodora, daughter of the famous Theodora and Theophylact I, Count of Tusculum. John was thus related by marriage to the famed Marozia. He sent his son Landulf to be raised in Rome by Marozia. His sister Orania married Docibilis II of Gaeta, cementing alliance between Gaeta and Naples. His elder son, Marinus, would succeed him in Naples. In 944, Marinus was appointed co-duke, and, in that same year, Odo of Cluny visited and influenced John to affirm the possessions of the monasteries in his domains.\nJohn was a man of letters and an amateur philosopher. He and Theodora commissioned the archpriest Leo to go to Constantinople as ambassador and bring back as many Greek manuscripts as possible. Leo returned with the Chronographia of Theophanes, the Antiquities of the Jews by Flavius Josephus, De Prodigiis by Livy, the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and the Historia Alexandri Magni. After Theodora's death, John took to reading and theorising, contemplation and translation into Latin, according to Leo.\nAn interesting anecdote is told of this duke by Peter Damian. The legend probably dates from 981 and may have basis in historical fact. In a vision, John saw a group of devils leading a line of horses drawing carts full of hay for the purpose of burning Pandulf Ironhead, the deceased prince of Capua, and himself, still very alive.

From 1908 to 1923, he was president of the Reichsbank and his signature appears on German Reichsbank notes from 1908 to 1923.\nHavenstein played an important part in the hyperinflationary process in Germany since he subscribed to the widespread belief then present in Germany that the inflation was caused by the fall in the external value of the mark against foreign currencies and that the role of the Reichsbank was to print sufficient money to sustain the higher price levels.  The more money that was printed the higher the price level became, so the Reichsbank then printed even more money and so on.  In other words, rather than following the Quantity Theory of Money in ascribing inflation to the excessive printing of money, Havenstein believed that money had to be printed to feed the rising demand for money within the German economy as prices were driven up by the fall in the exchange rate.  It was Havenstein's death in November 1923 that helped to bring this policy to an end and, with it, the hyperinflation.Havenstein was involved in the introduction of war bonds at the beginning of the First World War.\nHe died in Berlin and is buried in St. Anne's Cemetery in Berlin-Dahlem.", "hasanswer": true}]}

As they wait for the sheriff, the only on-duty ranger asks the woman her name, and what happened to her. The bride refers to herself as Kennedy, and the film flashes back to the previous day, to when Kennedy, her fianc\u00e9 Ryan, Kennedy's half-sister Hannah, their friend Emily, Ryan's cousin Derrick, and Ryan's friend Chet travelled to a secluded cabin for a Stag and doe party.\nAs the characters set up at the cabin, it is revealed that almost all of them have a dark secret; Kennedy's unspecified mental illness is flaring up due to wedding-related stress, Ryan is having an affair with Hannah, Derrick intends to extort Kennedy through Ryan in order to get the money he owes a drug dealer, and the caretaker, Bo, is the prime suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Susan. That night, while everyone else is participating in a scavenger hunt, Derrick is murdered with an axe. Upon noticing that Derrick is missing, the others go to look for him, and become separated, with Kennedy and Ryan finding Derrick's corpse, and Emily presumably being murdered after she, Chet, and Hannah encounter Bo, who has the axe that was used to kill Derrick. The remaining partiers regroup at the cabin, and discover that the power has been cut, the vehicle has been sabotaged, and that all of the cellular phones have been thrown into the stove. Chet then goes missing, Bo is found dying from a head wound, and Hannah is knifed by someone wearing a burlap sack as a mask. Kennedy stumbles onto Emily and Chet's bodies, and then Hannah's, which Ryan is with. Thinking Ryan is the killer, Kennedy attacks him, and runs off.\nAt dawn, Ryan returns to the cabin, where he and Kennedy fight, ending with Kennedy stabbing Ryan to death after Ryan spitefully declares that he never loved her. Kennedy then goes into hysterics, puts on her wedding dress, and runs into Emily, who claims that she had only been injured, and had faked being dead. The two women begin to walk to safety, until Emily lets slip information that only the killer could know. Kennedy confronts Emily, who asserts that she slew Derrick and Hannah, and had intended to murder Ryan, to protect her, with Chet and Bo being collateral damage. Kennedy snaps, and strangles Emily.\nThe film returns to the intro, and the bride lifts her veil to reveal that she is Emily, who had recovered, bludgeoned Kennedy, and taken her gown. The ranger offers his condolences for all that \"Kennedy\" has gone through, and when he gives Emily a pen to write down who he should contact for her, she stabs him in the neck with it, and walks out into the woods, leaving her fate unknown.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1914-1915, he informed the German government about Lenin\u00b4s plans and intended to use Bolshevik agitation to replace the Russian empire with a number of national states. Some earlier scholarship expressed skepticism, but other research has indicated that between 200,000 - 500,000 German Reichsmark was passed to Lenin by Germany using Kesk\u00fcla as a conduit.\nMichael Futrell interviewed Kesk\u00fcla whilst researching his book 1958-63. Here, Futrell records that although Kesk\u00fcla had only minimal contact with Lenin, he nevertheless passed money to him through another Estonian, Arthur Siefeldt, who drip fed the money into Bolsheviks hands by making a series of small secret donations. Other researches claim Kesk\u00fcla had given the Germans little of substance and he did not deliver any significant sums to the Bolsheviks.In 1918, he founded the Estonian Office in Stockholm to seek the support of the Entente states for Estonian independence. He acted in such status, until the official Estonian delegation forbade him to do that. The Estonian delegation was skeptical about Kesk\u00fcla and considered him a German agent.\nCentral in Kesk\u00fcla's thought was the region of Baltic Sea. According to Kesk\u00fcla's approach, Estonia had originally belonged to the Nordic region, but as a result of the German conquest in the 13th century it was included in the alien Central European cultural space. It then re-established its Nordic heritage in the 16-17th centuries and in the 18th century fell under the yoke of the even more alien Eastern European (Russian) sphere. Kesk\u00fcla thought that Estonia should separate from Russia and restore its place among the Nordic countries that were becoming increasingly unified.\nIn his later years, Kesk\u00fcla acted as the teacher of politics for several young Spanish scientists.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

An American soldier named Frankie is seen running alone through the jungle as his voice narrates. He explains that he \"goes back there every night\" right before he wakes up in bed with his wife in their squalid New York apartment. The distorted cries of his baby are heard, and his pregnant wife wakes up to tend to the boy. They argue over Frankie's unemployment and their son's health. The baby is a mutant, which Frankie assumes was a result of chemical weapons such as Agent Orange used during the war.\nA junkie scores from the local kingpin, Paco. Frankie waits in line outside the unemployment office. The junkie desperately searches for a needle to shoot up with. Frankie kills time entertaining a child prostitute. The junkie resorts to dumping the drugs directly onto a wound he opens in his arm and passes out. A random woman comes upon him and steals his gun and ammunition, putting them in her purse.\nThere is no work for Frankie at the unemployment office. Unexplained arbitrary things happen, such as one social worker asking another if he's seen his Veg-O-Matic. Frankie's social worker spaces out during their meeting and says, \"Life is hot, and because life is hot, I must take off my jacket.\" He then resumes the meeting, imploring Frankie to go back to school because he has no marketable skills. Frankie is desperate for work, having been unemployed for four months.\nHe calls his father to ask for money. His father thinks the call is a prank, since he believes his son died in Saigon. Frankie explains that he was reported killed 15 years ago but made it out alive and spent three years in an army hospital recuperating. He tells his father that his wife is pregnant again and they are being evicted, but his father claims that he is also broke and about to die from a heart condition.\nSeemingly broken, Frankie comes across the woman who stole the junkie's gun and steals her purse, an out of character criminal act for him. She screams for help. Paco and his thugs chase Frankie. When they overcome him, they mercilessly beat him. The gun falls out of the bag during the pummeling. When Paco goes through the bag, he finds the bullets and realizes there must have been a gun in it. He turns around to see Frankie standing with the gun.\nFrankie shoots all three men in a daze. He has been beaten to a pulp, and his voice-over explains that his father was right: he had died in Saigon. He explains that his company had come upon a village where everyone had killed themselves to avoid being raped and murdered by the US soldiers. He realizes that he must similarly 'save' his family, and he returns home.\nHis wife is horrified by his appearance and briefly tends to his wounds. He is catatonic and hallucinates in front of the TV. Eventually, he reloads the gun and prepares to kill himself, but another hallucination reminds him of his purpose for returning home. Frankie walks into the bedroom, tells his wife that he loves her, and then shoots her in the stomach. As she lies on the ground, he shoots her three more times, yelling at her to die. He shoots the baby once and then picks it up from the crib. He cradles it and walks into the kitchen with it.\nFrankie lays the baby in the oven and turns it all the way to the cleaning setting.

As a young man he taught school in Thamesford, Ontario. Hearing fellow Oxford County native George Leslie Mackay, Presbyterian missionary to Taiwan, speak, he sensed a call from God to go to China. He attended the University of Toronto, and Knox College, where he graduated in 1887, and was awarded the Doctor of Divinity in 1915. During his training, Goforth met Rosalind Bell-Smith at the Toronto Union Mission. Born in London, England, she had grown up in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. They married in 1887, in his final year at Knox, and eventually had eleven children, six of whom survived childhood.\nAfter initially subjecting him to teasing and even hazing, Goforth's classmates came to support him greatly in his quest to become an overseas missionary. Goforth had also read Hudson Taylor's China's Spiritual Need and Claims, a book that so excited him that he ordered many copies and mailed them to many pastors that he knew in order to promote missionary work in China.\nThe Goforths were sent to pioneer the North Henan mission in 1888. Their work was difficult and they lost five of their eleven children to sickness.\nIn 1900, the Goforths had to flee for many miles across China during the Boxer Rebellion. Jonathan was attacked and injured with a sword, but they both survived and escaped to the safety of one of the \"Treaty Ports\".\nThe Goforths returned to Canada for a year. After their return to Henan in 1901, Jonathan Goforth felt increasingly restless. In 1904 and 1905 he was inspired by news of the great Welsh revival and read Charles Finney's Lectures on Revivals. In 1907, circumstances brought him to witness firsthand the stirring Korean revival (\"When the Spirit's Fire Swept Korea\" [1943] represents his response). As Goforth returned to China through Manchuria in early 1908, congregations invited him back. During his extended visit there the \"Manchurian revival\" broke out, the first such revival to gain nationwide publicity in China as well as internationally. From 1908 to 1913, thousands of Chinese people converted to Christ. The revival transformed Goforth's life and ministry; from then on he was primarily an evangelist and revivalist, not a settled missionary. He also became one of the best-known of all China missionaries, admired by many, but criticized by some for \"emotionalism\".\nIn 1925, he decided to remain within the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and his Henan station was transferred to the support of the United Church of Canada. He and Rosalind, despite their age and frailties, were then sent by the church to begin work in Manchuria, where they remained until Goforth's eyesight failed in 1935. He remained active into the 1930s, especially in Manchuria; in 1931 the Goforths coauthored Miracle Lives of China. After his death in Toronto, Rosalind, a capable writer who had first published in 1920, wrote the popular Goforth of China (1937, with many reprints), and her own autobiography, Climbing: Memories of a Missionary's Wife (1940).\nTheir final years in Canada were spent recounting their stories to many congregations.

John Crosfield's mother, Eleanor Cadbury (1885\u20131959), was a daughter of the chocolate manufacturer and Quaker George Cadbury.

As the house was too small for his growing family, his father sold Grove Lodge to the novelist John Galsworthy in 1918 and they moved to Buckinghamshire, on the outskirts of Beaconsfield. From a very young age, he had a passion for making things. In the family workshop he made boats, steam engines, jigsaw puzzles and a cannon that he tested on the garage door. The shot went straight through the door and through his father's beloved Daimler. At prep school he and his friends built a model railway through the school grounds. At public school he built an O gauge model railway with a friend and with another friend linked two of the houses with a telephone line and exchanges for their respective studies. He played second violin for the school orchestra, but dropped music in favour of painting and model making.:\u200ap.369\u2013373\u200aWhile his early schooling was idyllic, he was bullied and hated the bad food and harsh discipline at the Downs School, where he was sent as a border at the age of nine.

After Essex's army was forced to surrender at Lostwithiel in Cornwall in September, the Royalists maintained a siege of Taunton, although the town was briefly relieved by Sir William Waller in late November.When determining strategy for 1645, King Charles I had despatched George, Lord Goring, the Lieutenant General of Horse (cavalry), to the West Country with orders to retake Taunton and other Parliamentarian outposts in the area. Although Goring briefly rejoined the King's main 'Oxford Army', tensions between him and Prince Rupert, the King's Captain General, nephew and chief adviser, resulted in Goring's force returning to the west.Parliament had meanwhile sent a substantial detachment commanded by Colonel Ralph Weldon, consisting of one cavalry regiment and four infantry regiments from their New Model Army, to relieve Taunton. They raised the siege on 11 May, but were themselves besieged by Goring's returning army (although there was no longer any danger of the Royalists storming the town).On 14 June, the main body of the New Model Army under Sir Thomas Fairfax, with Oliver Cromwell as Lieutenant General of Horse, won the decisive Battle of Naseby, destroying Charles's main army. After the Royalist garrison of Leicester surrendered four days later, the New Model Army was free to march to the relief of Taunton.\nThe army marched first south and then west, keeping near the coast so as to keep in touch with Parliament's navy. On 4 July it reached Beaminster, where Fairfax learned that Goring had raised the siege and was retreating towards the Royalist stronghold at Bridgwater. To cover the retreat of the baggage, Goring's army was spread over a front of 12 miles (19 km) along the north bank of the River Yeo, from Langport to Yeovil. The Royalists were outnumbered by Fairfax's army, and their discipline was poor, mainly because a succession of lax Royalist commanders had allowed their men too much license to pillage (which also alienated many of the local people).Fairfax was joined by Weldon's detachment from Taunton and advanced north towards Goring's army. On 8 July, the Parliamentarians captured Yeovil at the western end of the Royalists' line. The Royalists abandoned the line of the river, and Fairfax crossed to the north side of the Yeo. He sent another Parliamentarian force (part of the army of the \"Western Association\" under Major General Edward Massie) to deal with an attempted diversion in the direction of Taunton by some of Goring's cavalry under George Porter, a notoriously unreliable officer. Porter's men had neglected to post proper sentries and outposts, and were taken by surprise by Massie and destroyed at Isle Abbots in the early hours of 9 July.Fairfax had meanwhile advanced in pursuit of Goring, and encountered Goring's main position at Langport late on 9 July.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1846 he moved to Munich and received his technical and artistic education at the Polytechnical Institute and the Academy of Fine Arts.\nIn 1854 he entered the service of the Royal Bavarian State Railways, where he was concerned with building construction such as the modification of the station in  Gem\u00fcnden am Main.\nLeo von Klenze made him his assistant, and he worked in Klenze's office up to Klenze's death in 1864.\nDollmann completed the Befreiungshalle and expanded the Assyrian Hall in the Glyptothek courtyard.

In Berlin he could not reach a postdoctoral lecturer qualification because of his Jewish origin, so he became a private lecturer (Privatdozent) for political science and international law in Heidelberg.\nBut his inclinations to journalism soon won the upper hand, and, his living assured by his family, he gave up teaching.He was very much taken by the questions surrounding the movements of 1848.  His feeble attempts at practical politics nevertheless foundered and left him more and more to make himself known through his pen and his theories.  He spoke at the agitated mass meeting at Unter den Zelten where the legislature's petition to the king regarding the wishes of the people was discussed.  He became one of the chief editors, with Arnold Ruge and Eduard Meyen, of \u201cDie Reform\u201d (The Reform) which soon came under the oversight of several democratic groups. Among his other co-workers on this paper were Mikhail Bakunin, Karl Heinzen and Georg Herwegh. Oppenheim sought a seat in the National Assembly. He thought it sufficient to refer to his writings in \u201cDie Reform\u201d where he developed his premise \u201cthat only with freedom did the people become mature enough for freedom,\u201d but the people of Berlin had no patience with a candidate who campaigned only with his pen. This experience convinced him even more he that he was suited to a writing career, as he did not seem suited to speaking.He went to Baden and, looking for secrets, broke into the private files of the departed archduke.  Lorenzo Brentano, the leader of the provisional government, put him in charge of the government newspaper, the \u201cKarlsruher Zeitung\u201d.  When a schism broke out between Brentano's moderates and Gustav Struve's terrorists, Oppenheim worked for the latter, and was dismissed from the newspaper when they failed.  He then traveled to Switzerland, France, the Netherlands and England. He returned in 1850 and continued to publish works on democratic ideas.  He denounced the democrats for the victories of the Reaction, but thought the latter were ultimately to blame because they turned to raw despotic power rather than continuing with their phony constitutionalism.In 1861 Oppenheim joined the German Progress Party and edited the Yearbook for Politics and Literature which was banned soon afterwards. He also became a member of the Congress of German Economists, as he was known as an excellent economist and supporter of free trade. He also paid attention to social matters.\nThe occurrences of 1866 worked a great transformation in Oppenheim.  He greeted the new order with joy while other liberals were more skeptical.  Oppenheim joined the National Liberals and supported Bismarck's strategy for national unification. He wrote two flyers for the elections, one of which only saw limited distribution since the leaders saw it as too radical.  After 1870, for the first time he directly discussed practical questions, writing on poor laws and economics.  He was also critical of \u201cfanciful thinkers about the future among the teachers in the universities.\u201dIn the 1874 election, he was elected Member of the Reichstag representing Reu\u00df \u00e4. L. and took his seat as an expert on the 1869 changes to commercial regulations.  In 1877 he lost his seat to a social democrat.  In reaction to Bismarck's protectionist policy he split with his party in 1880.\nOppenheim's philosophical work is concentrated on parliamentarism the idea of common welfare.

While driving near an abandoned pavilion on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, Mary begins experiencing visions of a ghoulish, pale-faced figure (referred to as \"The Man\" in the credits).

Mary takes a ride out to the pavilion at the lake with the church's minister who stops her from entering, warning that it is against the law.\nMary continues experiencing visions of The Man and also rejects the repeated advances of John, a neighboring lodger. Mary goes to the pavilion by herself to investigate but does not find anything. Later, Mary begins experiencing terrifying interludes when she becomes invisible and inaudible to the rest of the world, as if she were not there. During one of these episodes, Mary meets Dr. Samuels who offers to help her while acknowledging he is not a psychiatrist. Mary returns to the church by herself to practice the organ and finds herself shifting from a hymn to eerie music. In a trance, she sees visions of The Man and other ghouls dancing at the pavilion. The minister, hearing the strange music, denounces it as sacrilege and insists that Mary resign.\nThat night, Mary accompanies John to a bar. Terrified of being alone with her nightmares, Mary tells John she wants his company. When they return home, John tries to convince Mary to let him stay the night, however Mary becomes hysterical when she sees The Man in the mirror. John leaves, believing Mary to be insane. The following morning, Mary returns to the pavilion where she encounters The Man and his fellow ghouls. She tries frantically to escape, however the locals do not acknowledge her and she only encounters more ghouls until she wakes up, revealing the previous scene to be merely a nightmare. She is later drawn back to the pavilion once again, where she finds the ghouls dancing, with a ghoul version of herself paired with The Man. She tries to run away but is chased by the ghouls onto the beach, where she collapses as they close in.\nThe following day, Dr. Samuels, the minister, and the police go to the pavilion to look for Mary.

Immediately after birth, she was called Agi (\uc544\uae30, \u963f\u53ea, meaning \"baby\") and then named Deokhye. Her mother was a low-ranking court lady working in the kitchen of Deoksugung. Gojong had 16 children with his 10 wives, but Deokhye was his first daughter; his four other daughters were not counted as they all died under the age of one. Gojong was delighted with the birth of his first daughter and raised her with meticulous love. In 1916, he established the Deoksugung Kindergarten dedicated to her, where Deokhye would attend. However, apart from her father, because she didn't have an official title, she was ignored and treated like she did not exist. Later, she was nicknamed \"Boknyeong-dang\".\nIn 1917, her father persuaded Terauchi Masatake, the then-ruling Governor-General of Korea, to enter her name into the registry of the Imperial Family, offering her legitimacy and granting her the title of princess.\nIn 1919, Emperor Gojong planned a secret engagement between Princess Deokhye and Kim Jang-han, the nephew of Kim Hwang-jin, a court chamberlain. He had sought to protect his daughter through it, but the engagement failed due to Japan's intervention and Kim Hwang-jin was not permitted to enter Deoksu Palace again.

She influenced other authors through her salon and also with her poetry, plays, and epigrams, often thematically tied to her lesbianism and feminism.\nBarney was born into a wealthy family. She was partly educated in France, and expressed a desire from a young age to live openly as a lesbian. She moved to France with her first romantic partner, Eva Palmer. Inspired by the work of Sappho, Barney began publishing love poems to women under her own name as early as 1900. Writing in both French and English, she supported feminism and pacifism. She opposed monogamy and had many overlapping long and short-term relationships, including on-and-off romances with poet Ren\u00e9e Vivien and courtesan Liane de Pougy and longer relationships with writer \u00c9lisabeth de Gramont and painter Romaine Brooks. \nBarney hosted a salon at her home in Paris for more than 60 years, bringing together writers and artists from around the world, including many leading figures in French, American, and British literature. Attendees of various sexualities expressed themselves and mingled comfortably at the weekly gatherings. She worked to promote writing by women and hosted a \"Women's Academy\" (L'Acad\u00e9mie des Femmes) in her salon as a response to the all-male French Academy. The salon closed for the duration of World War II while Barney lived in Italy with Brooks. She initially espoused some pro-fascist views, but supported the Allies by the end of the war. After the war, she returned to Paris, resumed the salon, and continued influencing or inspiring writers such as Truman Capote.\nBarney had a wide literary influence. Remy de Gourmont addressed public letters to her using the nickname l'Amazon (the Amazon), and Barney's association with both de Gourmont and the nickname lasted until her death. Her life and love affairs served as inspiration for many novels written by others, ranging from de Pougy's erotic French bestseller Idylle Saphique to Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness, the most famous lesbian novel of the twentieth century.", "hasanswer": true}]}

As a professional baseball player, his major league career spanned from 1899 to 1914 in which he played mainly in the National League for seven teams over 12 seasons. His most notable time was with the New York Giants, where he starred in the outfield for John McGraw's 1904 pennant winners and 1905 World Series champions. One of the finest hitters of the dead-ball era, his .333 career batting average ranks 28th all time and he finished in the top three in batting five times. In each of those same seasons, he also finished in the top ten in the league in on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and home runs.\nDonlin, who was given the nickname \"Turkey Mike\" for his unique strut, was a controversial character\u2014 his entertaining personality, flamboyant style of dress, and prodigious talent as a hitter caused him to be lionized as \"the baseball idol of Manhattan.\" However, alcoholism led to friction with club officials and incarceration. Donlin attempted to leverage his popularity as an athlete to launch a career in Broadway theatre where he met and married vaudeville comedian Mabel Hite in 1906. Together, they performed in the baseball-themed play Stealing Home for about three years.\nBetween the waning popularity of the play in 1911 and Hite's death the following year, Donlin attempted short-lived comebacks with the Giants, Boston Rustlers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. His forays into acting cut short an undeniable talent that could have been a much more successful major league career; he reached 100 games in just five of his major league seasons. After convincing McGraw to sign him for the last time in 1914, Donlin endured a disappointing 35-game cameo with the Giants, leading him to devote his efforts to launch his acting career. He migrated to Hollywood, where close friend John Barrymore helped him attain work. Although he made at least 53 appearances on film, the prospects of stardom never materialized.

After a period working in agriculture for his uncle he moved to Birmingham in 1794 and secured an apprenticeship as a designer to Thomas Keeling, a firm of clockmakers and enamellers. Lines was then employed by Messrs Osborn and Gunby of Bordesley as a sword blade decorator, designer and engraving to the highest standard.Lines studied drawing under Joseph Barber at the latter's academy on Great Charles Street, and in 1807 opened his own academy for training pupils in drawing and painting in Newhall Street. This was so successful that he was able to build his own house in Temple Row.Lines' pupils included Thomas Creswick, Bernard Walter Evans, Andrew Hunt, Henry Martin Pope, William Wyon, and his own sons Samuel Rostill Lines, Frederick Thomas Lines and Henry Harris Lines. His art classes notoriously started at five o'clock in the morning, with Lines himself personally visiting latecomers to rouse them.In addition to his influence on Birmingham's fine artists, Lines' tuition was to have a deep impact upon standards of design and craftsmanship across Birmingham's industries: at the time of the exhibition of works by his pupils in 1854 it was found that \"by a reference to the Catalogue of the Great Exhibition of 1851, in London, it may be seen that upwards of forty-two of the most distinguished manufacturers of Birmingham received the rudiments of their artistic requirements at their Academy.\"Lines' own academy held annual exhibitions of pupils' work, with prizes for \"Best Perspective Drawing\" and \"Best Drawing in the Round\", though Lines himself remarked that \"No exhibition would satisfy me until we could have a public one, on similar lines to the Royal Academy\". In 1809 he was one of a group of local artists who founded the Birmingham Academy of Arts \u2013 a school of life drawing that came closer to Lines' vision by holding its first public exhibition of its members' works after moving to Union Street in 1814. In 1821 this was refounded as the Birmingham Society of Arts with the help of wealthy local patrons, until the breakaway Birmingham Society of Artists formed in 1842 in protest at the society's decision to reform itself into a dedicated Government School of Design. Lines was the treasurer and curator of the society until he resigned at the age of eighty, when he was elected an honorary life member.

His name is sometimes written Lansberg, and his first name is sometimes given as Philip or  Johannes Philippus.  He published under the Latin name Philippus Lansbergius.\nHe is best known as the author of a set of astronomical tables, Tabulae motuum coelestium perpetu\u00e6, for predicting planetary positions.  These were later found to contain certain errors, in part because he (erroneously) did not accept Kepler's discovery of elliptical orbits. He served as a Protestant clergyman.\nMartinus Hortensius was one of his students, and Landsberge subsequently collaborated with his former pupil.\nHe was born in Ghent in modern-day Belgium in 1561. He grew up in France and studied in England. After the Fall of Antwerp in 1585, he moved to the northern part of the Netherlands. He stayed in Leiden for a short time, and then he went to Goes to become a preacher. Lansbergen lived there until 1613. In that year, he was fired because he did not agree with a mayoral election. The fifty-two-year-old Lansbergen decided to move to Middelburg to devote himself to astronomical research, which he did until the end of his life.\nLansbergen supported the heliocentric theory of Copernicus, who claimed that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This theory was controversial in both Catholic and Protestant circles, where the geocentric theory had been more widely held.\nHe married Sara Lievaerts in 1586 and they had six sons and four daughters. He had a great reputation, because of his rare knowledge and expertise. Not only in matters of the church, but even more in mathematics and physics. In 1611, his son Pieter (1587) became a preacher in Goes. Jacob, another son, moved to Goes as well, but became a medical doctor. Lansbergens' oldest son, also called Philippus, was a preacher in Kloetinge and died there in 1647.\nLansbergen wrote several books. One of those, \"Considerations about the daily and yearly movements of the Earth\", became a best-seller. One could say that Lansbergen was the first Dutch author that wrote a popular book about the movements of the planets around the Sun.\nKepler and Galileo, who lived in the same period, were very interested in the work of Lansbergen. Based on his tables, they could predict the movements of the planets more accurately.Lansbergen probably lived in the \"Spanjaardstraat\" in Middelburg. He had frequent contacts with sympathizers, like the Dutch poet Jacob Cats. Cats wrote three poems about the \"very wise, famous, and honored Philippus Lansbergen\".\nHe died in Middelburg in December 1632.\nThe Philippus Lansbergen Public Observatory in Middleburg is named after him, and so is the lunar crater Lansberg.", "hasanswer": true}]}

This prompted a furious backlash from Mithridates in 89 BC, whose counter-attack began the First Mithridatic War.Aquillius marched with one legion of auxiliaries (4,000-6,000 men), the only troops available in the Asia province, against Mithridates from the west while Quintus Oppius, the governor of Cilicia, invaded with two legions from the south. Aquillius soon found out he was seriously outnumbered; at Lake Tatta he saw 100,000 Pontic infantry waiting for him. Mithridates' forces eventually tracked and defeated Aquillius near Protostachium. Aquillius fled and attempted to make his way back to Italy. He managed to make it to Lesbos, where he was delivered to Mithridates by the inhabitants of Mytilene. After being taken to the mainland, he was then placed on a donkey and paraded back to Pergamon. During the trip, he was forced to confess his supposed crimes against the peoples of Anatolia. Aquillius's father, the elder Manius Aquillius, was a former Roman governor of Pergamon and was hated for the egregious taxes that he imposed. It was generally thought that Manius Aquillius the younger would follow in the footsteps of his father as a tax profiteer and was hated by some of the local peoples.Aquillius was eventually executed by Mithridates by having molten gold poured down his throat.

Most historians who have considered the question believe that his father was Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States. Evidence from a 1998 DNA test showed that a descendant of Eston matched the Jefferson male line, and historical evidence also supports the conclusion that Thomas Jefferson was probably Eston's father. Many historians believe that Jefferson and Sally Hemings had six children together, four of whom survived to adulthood. Other historians disagree.Jefferson freed Eston and his older brother Madison Hemings in his will, as they had not yet come of age at his death. They each married and lived with their families and mother Sally in Charlottesville, Virginia, until her death in 1835. Both brothers and their young families moved to Chillicothe, Ohio, to live in a free state, where Eston Hemings earned a living as a musician and entertainer.\nIn 1852 Eston moved with his wife and three children to Madison, Wisconsin, where they changed their surname to Jefferson and entered the white community. Their sons both served in the Union Army, and the older one, John Wayles Jefferson, achieved the rank of colonel. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, becoming a wealthy cotton broker and never married.\nEston's other children, Beverly and Anna Jefferson, married into the white community, and their descendants have identified as white. Beverly Jefferson's five sons were educated and three entered the professional class as a physician, attorney, and manager at the railroad.

However, later problems with the board of trustees designated for this academy, as well as growing friction between the Church and the federal government, delayed its establishment.\nNo results of consequence had been obtained by August 1883, when Willard Young returned to Salt Lake City after his teaching appointments at West Point. He immediately began talking to the other trustees, and sought to obtain financial backing from the LDS Church. However, he received orders in October of 1883 to report to Portland, Oregon, and the matter was again dropped.\nDuring his absence, the LDS Church backed the establishment of the 'Salt Lake Stake Academy', which was created in 1886. This push, instituted by President Wilford Woodruff, was an effort to increase educational opportunities in the area: in 1888, the church established and put into operation 18 academies, operated through the church's \"stakes\" or ecclesiastical groups. As part of this push, in June 1888 the General Church Board of Education examined the deed of trust for the Brigham Young Academy at Salt Lake City. Following the meeting, Wilford Woodruff wrote a letter to Willard Young asking his aid in using the deeded property for the Salt Lake Stake Academy. No response from Young is recorded, and the Young Academy's deed remained unchanged. By 1 May 1890 it appears that Woodruff had decided against creating a church-based educational institution in Salt Lake City, because he and his counselors wrote to Young, asking him to resign his military commission and assume the presidency of a new, independent university, to be named Young Academy. This organization was renamed 'University of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' in 1892, and was locally referred to as 'the Church University'. It apparently was intended to become 'the' Mormon institution of higher learning, and a high class university, second to none in the west.\nYoung was in Salt Lake City by 30 November 1890. He vigorously promoted, arranged, planned, persuaded, and by September 1893 the institution began presenting lectures at 233 West 200 North. However, the effort lasted only through that school year; in spring 1894 its final classes were presented.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

In fact, a number of other Europeans had already learned to roll a kayak, but Pawlata is widely credited with the feat.\nBorn 19 February 1900 in Vienna, Pawlata had a passion for paddling the faltbooten or folding kayaks that were popular in Europe after World War I. He studied written accounts of the kayaks and skills of the Greenlandic Inuit, especially the work of Knud Rasmussen, Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen. From his research, he designed a folding kayak which he believed was \"purebred\" and more faithful to the original Arctic boats. The 4.9 metre long kayak was built for him by the firm of Otto Hartel in Graz, and he called it \"Aijuk\". On 30 July 1927, on the Weissensee, he publicly demonstrated his ability to capsize his kayak and right it again without leaving the cockpit. The method he devised, which involved gripping the far end of the paddle blade, is now known as the Pawlata roll and is still used as a training or sea kayaking technique. In the following year, he published a book called \"Kipp kipp hurra! Im reinrassigen Kajak. Eine ausf\u00fchrliche Anleitung zum Sichwiederaufrichten im Kajak (Faltboot)\" (\"Tip tip hooray! In a purebred kayak. A detailed manual for righting oneself in a kayak (folding kayak)\") In it he says:\n\n\"Quite contrary to the expectations of the old experienced paddler, on 30 July 1927, I succeeded as the first European sportsman to right himself again after capsizing in a kayak. Thus was the curse of the centuries-old Eskimo secret broken and kayaking ceased to exist in name only.\"Actually, a number of European missionaries and explorers had previously learned how to roll from the Inuit of Greenland, Paul Egede probably being the first in the 1730s.

He grew up on a farm with seven siblings. As a boy, he developed an interest in wandering the countryside where they lived, exploring nature and trying to figure out why things were the way they were.\nHe was a studious boy, a trait which his father encouraged. As he was on the clumsy side, when it came to farmwork, his brother Tom usually took on the heavier chores. For his education, he first attended the local public school, then was sent to the Whiteboro Seminary. The Gaynor family were Irish and devout Catholics, thus, when weather permitted, on Sundays they would head to the nearby city of Utica to attend Mass at St. John's Church on Bleecker Street. As William entered his teenage years, he began to show a religious fervor that led his parents to think that he might have a vocation to the Church. Both to test this, and for reasons of affordability, he was enrolled in the Assumption Academy in Utica. This was staffed by the Brothers of the Christian Schools. William flourished in that school, and soon decided that he did indeed wish to become a member of their religious congregation.\nIn December 1863, he was sent to New York City to enter the novitiate of the congregation. This was located at 44 East 2nd Street. The date of birth he gave at his admission was February 2, 1848, thus he was still fifteen at the time he was received. He was given the habit of the institute, and named Brother Adrian Denys. He spent the next four years in this house, both in training and soon in teaching in nearby parish schools. In 1868, he was one of a group of Brothers chosen to be sent to San Francisco to take care of St. Mary's College there. They sailed from New York on July 16, aboard the SS Ocean Queen.\nBy this time, however, as well as the usual readings in history, philosophy and the Church Fathers suggested to the Brothers, Gaynor had been reading and absorbing the reflection of a wide range of writers, mostly the ancient Stoic philosophers. One lifetime favorite which he found was the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, where he found much that resonated with his own way of thinking. The book was to be his lifelong companion. As a result, however, by the time the small group of Brothers had arrived at their destination, Gaynor had lost his belief in organized Christianity and had decided to leave the institute. Because of his youth, he had never taken religious vows, as he was too young to do so under the regulations of the Brothers, thus there was no canonical impediment to his departure.\nHe made his way back home to Utica, where his family now lived, arriving late that same year. How he managed that journey he never shared, other than to say that it had not been an easy or pleasant experience. His father welcomed him back and helped him to secure a position with the law firm of Horatio and John Seymour, that he might read enough law to take the bar examination. This was to be the start of his entry into the political arena, as Horatio Seymour had recently served as Governor of New York, and had just run as the Democratic Party's candidate for president against Ulysses S.

The marriage took place in 1739. This marriage was intended to strengthen the relationships between the houses of Romanov and Habsburg. In 1740, their infant son, Ivan, became emperor as Ivan VI. Initially, Duke Ernst Biron of Kurland was regent, but when rumors surfaced that Biron planned on exiling Anthony and Anna to Germany, they staged a coup and Anna was named regent. Not long after, a coup in 1741 removed the family from power.\nThe new Empress, Elizabeth, had Anthony Ulrich, his wife, and their children imprisoned. They remained so for the rest of their lives. The years of imprisonment were hard, and the family was periodically denied many necessary things. Virtually all communication with the outside world, with the exception of a few servants, was banned. The governor of Arkhangelsk regularly visited them to inquire about their health.\nIn 1762, Elizabeth died, and the new Empress Catherine offered the Duke permission to leave Russia, with the condition he leave his children behind; but he declined.

Joseph Cooper, a former NASA astronaut, along with his son and daughter, Tom and Murph, and father-in-law Donald, are farmers, like most of humanity. One evening, during a dust storm, Cooper and Murph discover a gravitational anomaly in Murph's bedroom that left patterns of falling particles. The pattern represents GPS coordinates, which lead Cooper and Murph to a secret NASA facility.\nNASA's mission is to find a habitable planet beyond the solar system. A team is preparing to travel through a wormhole near Saturn leading to a galaxy with three potentially habitable planets, based on data from three probe missions, each orbiting the supermassive blackhole Gargantua. Dr. Brand, lead scientist, asks Cooper to pilot the ship due to his experience. Cooper struggles with leaving his children behind, but promises Murph that he will return. Heartbroken, Murph refuses to say goodbye. The Endurance spacecraft takes off with three other NASA scientists \u2212 Romilly, Doyle, and Brand's daughter Amelia \u2212 as well as two intelligent robots, TARS and CASE.\nA couple years later, the crew enters the wormhole and arrives at the first planet to find an ocean world with massive tidal waves. Doyle is swept away and killed. Cooper and Amelia wait for water to drain from the craft and return to the Endurance, where 23 years have passed for Romilly due to time dilation.\nOn Earth in 2092, an adult Murph helps Dr. Brand with an equation to solve the problem of mass exodus \u2014 transporting Earth's population off the planet. On his deathbed, Brand reveals that the crew's goal was to colonize another planet rather than return with data that would help the existing population. Murph, despite wondering if Cooper knowingly abandoned her, continues to work on the problem.\nOn the second planet, the crew awakens the probe mission's explorer, Dr. Mann, from cryostasis. Mann offers to show Cooper the hospitable part of the planet, but then confesses to having falsified data so that someone might rescue him from the deserted ice world, and they begin to fight. Cooper survives the fight, while Romilly is killed while accessing Mann's data. Mann takes the Endurance crew's lander and beats them to the Endurance. With TARS having removed his security clearance to dock, Mann fails to dock correctly and is killed in an explosion that damages a portion of Endurance. Cooper and Amelia, with limited fuel remaining, chart a gravity-assist path around Gargantua to propel the craft to the third planet, causing another 51 years to dilate. At the last moment, Cooper detaches himself so that Amelia may reach the final planet. He and TARS fall beyond the black hole's event horizon.\nCooper falls into a four-dimensional tesseract, with time as a physical dimension, that appears to be the back of Murph's bookshelf. He uses gravity to communicate with Murph and his past self, and realizes he sent the NASA coordinates and initiated this mission, and that a future generation created the tesseract to preserve humankind. He decides to feed Murph the blackhole gravity data to help her solve the equation, and encodes the data as Morse code into the ticking second hand of his wristwatch, which he gave Murph. Murph comes across the watch while visiting the family home for the last time. The tesseract dissolves, ejecting Cooper and TARS through the wormhole and into Saturn's orbit again where, in 2156, a couple of Rangers rescue them.\nCooper awakens on a hospital bed inside a massive O'Neill cylinder named after Murph, with whom he later reunites, and is now relatively older than him. Murph asks Cooper not to watch her die and to go to Amelia, so both he and TARS steal a Ranger and set off for the third planet, where Amelia is directing the setup of a new colony.

During these years he became politically associated with Calvin Coolidge, who was Senate President and Lieutenant Governor.  Coolidge tapped Cox as his running mate for governor in 1918, and Cox served two one-year terms as lieutenant governor.  Coolidge stepped back to run for Vice President of the United States in 1920.Cox ran for governor in 1920, which was the first two-year term for the office.  His victory over John Jackson Walsh was part of a broad national win for the Republicans, including a sweep of statewide offices in Massachusetts, which was spurred by nativist opposition to Wilson administration policies on immigration.  Cox contributed to the anti-immigrant sentiment in Massachusetts by characterizing discontented immigrants as a \"motley array of questionable groups and influences\".  He won reelection in 1922, in another race against disorganized Democratic opposition.  Although the state was in an economic downturn (an early whisper of the Great Depression), with textile production dropping and wages down, his campaigns emphasized \"economy and sound administration\" in governance, terms which characterized Republican campaigns through the 1920s.  In 1922, Cox defeated former Mayor of Boston John \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald by more than 60,000 votes.As governor, Cox was somewhat more progressive than Coolidge, advancing a variety of modest reforms.  He increased schooling requirements and reduced working hours for children, allowed labor unions to instigate lawsuits against employers, and improved workmen's compensation coverage.  He signed legislation restricting the ability of state banks to engage in speculative investments, and instituted a commission on finance and reform to oversee the state's finances. In the 1922 race, Cox claimed credit for reducing income taxes by $2 million and the state's debt by $12 million.

From 1802 to 1805, he worked in Philadelphia as the botanical manager of the extensive gardens of William Hamilton, Esq., \"The Woodlands.\" By 1805, he was working for Benjamin Smith Barton on a new flora of North America, under whom he studied the plants collected on the Lewis and Clark Expedition.  His work with Barton allowed him to travel farther afield. In 1805, he traveled south from Maryland to the Carolinas and, in 1806, he traveled north from the mountains of Pennsylvania to New Hampshire. He made both trips principally on foot, with only his dog and a gun, covering over three thousand miles each season.\nBarton's proposed flora was never written, but Pursh, who then moved to London, England, did make a major contribution to North American botany in his Flora americae septentrionalis; or A Systematic Arrangement and Description of The Plants of North America (variously dated as published in 1813 or 1814). He then returned to America, moving to Canada in 1816. He botanized a great deal in Quebec, but all the material he accumulated was destroyed by fire before it could be organized into suitable form for publication. His hopes of carrying out further major work were prevented by ill health due to alcoholism.\nHe was so destitute when he died in Montreal that his funeral expenses had to be defrayed by his friends. His remains lay in the Papineau Road cemetery until 1857, when they were moved to the Mount Royal Cemetery. A proper monument was paid for by subscription.

He won the Memorial Cup with the Hamilton Fincups in 1976, and represented Canada at the 1977 and 1978 World Junior Championships. A rare blend of size and skill, Huber stepped directly into the Wings' lineup the following season, notching 31 points and being named the team's Rookie of the Year.\nFor most of his career (until the arrival of Kjell Samuelsson in 1986) Huber was the largest player in the NHL at 6'5\" and 228 lbs, towering over most other players in the league. Despite his size, however, Huber was primarily an offensive defender. Blessed with exceptional hands and skating ability, Huber was amongst the league's highest goal-scoring defenders in the early 1980s and a fixture on the Detroit powerplay. While he was also solid in his own zone, fans often - unfairly - expected him to be a nasty physical presence, which did not come as naturally to him.\nHuber scored at least 14 goals and 40 points for Detroit every season between 1979 and 1983 and was one of the team's top players during a comparatively lackluster period of Red Wing history. Huber and Reed Larson formed one of the more dangerous blueline power-play combinations in the league during this period. He was chosen to represent Canada at the 1981 World Championships and helped the team to a 4th-place finish. In 1983, he was selected to play in the NHL All-Star Game.\nFollowing a contract dispute with the Red Wings, Huber was dealt to the New York Rangers in the summer of 1983. He picked up where he left off offensively, but tore ligaments in his left knee midway through the season and was limited to 23 points in just 42 games. The following season, he tore ligaments in his right knee. As a result, his once-excellent mobility declined considerably, as did his offensive production. By 1985\u201386, he scored only 15 points in 70 games. He bounced back to score 30 points in 1986\u201387, but was traded to the Vancouver Canucks early in 1987\u201388. After a short, disappointing stint in Vancouver, he was dealt to the Philadelphia Flyers at the trade deadline, where he experienced a surprise resurgence with 13 points in 10 games.\nHowever, following the season Philadelphia wanted him to take a pay cut, and after a resulting season-long holdout he retired in 1989. He finished his 10-year career with 104 goals and 321 points in 655 career games, along with 950 penalty minutes.\nFollowing his days in hockey, he chose to remain near the game, working in the operations departments at Copps Coliseum, Hamilton Place, and the Hamilton Convention Centre.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Darwin knew Dieffenbach's paper on the Chatham Islands, contributed to the journal of the Royal Geographical Society, and he particularly noted Dieffenbach's commentary on the differences between the species of birds there and in New Zealand. Dieffenbach also translated the Geological Manual of Henry De la Beche. Partly as a result of these efforts, in 1850 he was named adjunct professor of geology at Giessen, a post he held until his death there.\nThe extinct Dieffenbach's rail (Gallirallus dieffenbachii) a flightless rail formerly endemic to the Chatham Islands, was named after him. (The plant genus Dieffenbachia was named after the head gardener of the Botanical Gardens in Vienna, Joseph Dieffenbach (1796\u20131863).)", "hasanswer": true}]}

He married twice and amassed a fortune in the weaving industry. He rose to prominence during the early stages of the Hundred Years' War. Fearful that hostilities between France and England would hurt the prosperity of Ghent, he entered political life in 1337. He set up an alliance with Bruges and Ypres (later the Four Members) in order to show neutrality. Van Artevelde gained control of the insurrection against Louis I, the Count of Flanders who had abandoned his father's anti-French policies. Louis I was forced to flee to France, while van Artevelde served as captain general of Ghent from that time until his death.\nFlemish relations with England had traditionally been good, due to wool and textile trade. Neutrality was eventually broken, and the towns took the side of the English in 1340. In that year, van Artevelde persuaded the federation to recognise King Edward III of England as sovereign of France and overlord of Flanders.\nFlemish trade and industry flourished under van Artevelde's semi-dictatorial rule. In 1345, however, rumours that he planned to recognise the son of Edward III, the Black Prince, as count of Flanders, suspicion of embezzlement, and the excommunication by the Pope caused a popular uprising in Ghent, and van Artevelde was killed by an angry mob.\nHis son Philip van Artevelde later took up the Flemish cause and died in the Battle of Roosebeke in 1382.", "hasanswer": false}]}

With the success of the Samsung Electronics commercial in 1988, she turned the relationship between advertising model and actor upside down. While commercial modeling was often a sideline after an actor gained recognition through the success of a drama, Choi's commercials gave her the same recognition that an actor gained through a drama, showing that the advertising world could be an equally stately stage for an actor. Her swift rise to stardom coincided with the dramatic changes in South Korea's political, economic, social, and cultural landscape. Samsung Electronics used the 1988 Seoul Olympics to boost the popularity of color TVs, and Choi helped the company beat out its competitors to the top spot in home appliance sales, appearing in commercials for most of their products.Choi believed that commercials, even as 30-second videos, have an aesthetic that captures the spirit of the times, and that they are an integration of artistic activities; from basic visual arts, marketing techniques and image-making that borrowed from psychology, to the brilliant slogans and dialogue. In an interview with CyberTimes.TV, Choi said that she considers her commercials as part of her work as an actress. Her success as an advertising model was apparent in her endorsements for South Korean giants Samsung, LG, Lotte, KIA Motors, Hyundai, Korea Telecom, and various clothing and cosmetics brands, among others. She maintained a relationship with KT and Samsung throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and was a contributor for the latter's increase in market share. As an expression of goodwill, she filmed a free commercial for KIA Motors when the company was facing bankruptcy due to the Asian financial crisis.In October 1992, Choi became the first celebrity to throw out the first pitch in the KBO League Korean Series. In a public opinion poll on 'Advertising Model Preference' conducted by the Korea Broadcast Advertising Corporation, she ranked first overall with 52% of the votes, while Yoo In-chon ranked first among male advertising models with 13%. She consistently topped consumer preference surveys and is the most-loved advertising model of her time. In the same month, she was invited to the Blue House luncheon hosted by President Roh Tae-woo as a person of merit in saving. In December 1992, she was awarded the inaugural Star of the Year Award by the weekly broadcast information magazine TV Journal.Ma Jung-mi, a culture researcher and advertising critic, published a book called The Choi Jin-sil Syndrome (Chungha, 1993; ISBN 978-89-403-0163-0). The book analyzes \"Choi Jin-sil and eroticism\", \"The product aesthetic of Choi Jin-sil\", \"The new generation theory symbolized by Choi Jin-sil,\" and \"The relationship between commercials featuring Choi Jin-sil and capitalism\". Ma's cultural analysis focuses on the post-war period as 'before' and the early 1990s as 'after', when Choi began her career as an entertainer. The book, which studied popularity factors for a celebrity, broke new ground in the field of theoretical books analyzing influential stars in popular culture.In April 1993, MBC conducted a poll among students to determine 'Korea's Top 100 Stars', including all public figures such as politicians, actors, singers, comedians, athletes, etc. President Kim Young-sam topped the list and Choi was number two, at a time when the president's popularity was soaring due to the crackdown on bribery and the disclosure of public officials' assets. Choi became the face of the real-name financial system the following year in 1994 and was invited by President Kim to a luncheon at the Blue House.She worked at MBC from 1988 until 1993. In February 1994, she signed an exclusive contract with SBS for 100 episodes, and became the highest paid actor at the time of her move to the new network, which was known in the industry for offering huge contracts to secure big-name talents. She spent the next two years appearing in SBS dramas such as Scent of Love, Asphalt Man, and Jazz, helping raise the profile of the network. However, before completing 100 episodes, she was offered a role at MBC in 1995 and was cast in the MBC weekend drama Apartment. Her appearance in Apartment was an indication of her status, in that MBC brought back an SBS-exclusive actress despite the fact that she had left MBC, and in that SBS was willing to allow her to appear on another network, even though she still had an exclusive contract with SBS. In March 1996, SBS re-signed Choi an exclusive contract. She was offered several drama roles but had repeatedly declined, saying, \"The role is not right.\" Since she was occupied with films and CFs, she also had to turn down offers due to scheduling conflict. A year later in 1997, MBC offered her a role in a drama, and she decided to appear in MBC's Star in My Heart. When SBS filed for a preliminary injunction, then MBC President Lee Deuk-ryul reportedly went to the top management of SBS and asked for leniency. MBC executives also personally visited SBS executives. Unlike in 1995, SBS demanded a penalty fee from Choi as per the contract, and MBC agreed to pay the penalty instead.In late 1994, MBC's The New Human Era surveyed stars in various fields for a New Year's special titled '50 Leading Koreans', and Choi was ranked first in the actress category. On November 29, 1994, the city of Seoul held an event to bury a time capsule to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the establishment of Seoul as the capital in 1394, and also included an interview with Choi, who said, \"I want to be someone who will go down in history. Please remember me. Thank you.\" The time capsule will be opened 400 years later in 2394.\nIn March 1996, she became the face of the ruling New Korea Party, the first time in the history of South Korean politics that a celebrity has been the face of a political party. The New Korea Party was founded in December 1995, dropping the name Democratic Liberal Party in an attempt to shed its military image. The party selected Choi to be the face of its newspaper advertisements in an effort to break down the rigid public image of existing political parties and make them more approachable to the people. The New Korea Party said, \"Choi Jin-sil, who is popular with almost all voters from those in their 20s to those in their 60s, will help enhance the image of the party. It was a choice to break away from the politics of the authoritarian era,\" and added, \u201cOur party will do our best to avoid compromising Choi Jin-sil\u2019s popularity.\u201dIn a 1997 survey of public figures who fulfilled their ambitions, Choi was ranked as the number one celebrity, along with then president Kim Young-sam as the number one politician, Hyundai Group founder Chung Joo-young as the number one businessman, and baseball player Park Chan-ho as the number one sportsman. In October 1997, Samsung Economic Research Institute published a report titled Star Power Analysis of Korean Movie Stars, analyzing the power of 50 leading actors in 529 films released in Seoul from 1988 to 1995. Choi was selected as the movie star with the best audience mobilization power along with actor Choi Min-soo. In December 1997, Choi and comedian Lee Kyung-kyu visited the 15th president-elect Kim Dae-jung at his home for an interview.In March 1998, Korea Telecom released a public phone card modeled after Choi for a campaign to overcome the economic crisis. In August 1998, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the nation, Gallup Korea conducted a survey on \u2018Top Celebrities of the 50 Years of the Founding of the Republic of Korea'. Choi ranked first overall in the talent and actor category for all age groups combined, beating out the most popular actors of the past and of her time. The poll surveyed men and women aged between 11 and 59 across the country. In the same month, she appeared in a national promotional campaign alongside President Kim Dae-jung. Although Choi was not in politics, her image as the \"soft power of the masses\" was used to represent the current post-authoritarian and post-military government at the time. Her success as a commercial model made her the embodiment of the zeitgeist of the populus, where politics needed to be advertised anew.In December 1999, MBC produced a documentary that looked at modern Korean history in the 20th century, featuring 60 people, including Choi in the \"Heroes and Idols\" category. The program featured 20 people in each of three categories: \"Leaders and Revolutionaries\", \"Women\", and \"Heroes and Idols\"; and showcased these individuals who have had a significant impact on history or society in general, or who have worked to break new ground. Sunday Night, the longest-running South Korean television entertainment program, conducted a poll of 1,000 Seoul citizens on the \u2018Best Star of the 20th Century\u2019 in each field of the entertainment industry. Choi was voted the best star among television actors.In October 2003, Nielsen Media Research conducted a survey on the most popular South Korean leading actors based on the top 50 television dramas with the highest viewership ratings of all time. Choi was recorded as the most prolific actor with lead roles in six TV dramas, including Promise (1992), Jealousy (1992), Season of Storms (1993), You and I (1997), Star in My Heart (1997), and Roses and Bean Sprouts (1999). Her Jealousy co-star Choi Soo-jong came in second with lead roles in five dramas.In 2005, Choi was voted as the most popular talent among men and women according to a survey by Gallup Korea. From the result of the survey conducted among 1,502 adult men and women aged 20 and older across the country, Choi ranked first with 18.2% of the votes. She received the full support of female viewers in their 20s and 40s.In 2010, leading Chinese portal Wang Yi selected the 'Top 10 Female Protagonists in Korean Dramas', and posted photos of actresses along with nicknames based on each actress' characteristics. Choi was voted the number one female protagonist, with netizens giving her the nickname \"Eternal Cinderella\" for her starring role in Star in My Heart.In 2011, Ezday surveyed netizens about the most memorable dramas from the 1990s. Jealousy starring Choi Jin-sil and Choi Soo-jong was voted as the most memorable drama by 20% of respondents, followed closely by Star in My Heart also starring Choi and Ahn Jae-wook with 19% of the votes. For 'Best Actress of the 1990s', Choi took the top spot by a wide margin with 34% of respondents, followed by Kim Hee-sun, Shim Eun-ha, Shin Ae-ra, Lee Seung-yeon, and Jeon Do-yeon. For 'Best Actor of the 1990s', Jang Dong-gun was chosen by 21% of respondents.On November 15, 2014, she received the Achievement Award at the 3rd Asia Pacific Actors Network (APAN) Star Awards for her contribution to the development of Korean dramas as a first-generation Hallyu actress.In a 2015 survey for the 30th anniversary of The Daily Sports Seoul, 30 entertainment industry experts from broadcasting, film, and music were asked to reflect on 30 years of Korean entertainment. Choi was chosen as the best actress of the past 30 years, with Sports Seoul writing, \"Among actresses, the most prominent is the now-deceased Choi Jin-sil. As she was voted by 10 respondents, the vacancy she left felt even bigger\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is housed in the Museo della Madonna del Parto of Monterchi, Tuscany, Italy.\nPiero della Francesca finished it in seven days, using high quality colors, including a large quantity of blu oltremare obtained using lapis lazuli imported from Afghanistan by the Republic of Venice.\nThe fresco was at one time located in Santa Maria di Momentana, (formerly Santa Maria in Silvis), an old country church in the hill town of Monterchi. That building was destroyed in 1785 by an earthquake and this work was detached from the walls and placed over the high altar of a new cemetery chapel; in 1992 it was moved to the Museo della Madonna del Parto in Monterchi. It was only in 1889 that the work was attributed to Piero della Francesca. Its dating has been the subject of debate, with estimates ranging from 1450 to 1475. The 16th century artist and writer Giorgio Vasari wrote that it was completed in 1459, when Piero della Francesca was in Sansepolcro because of his mother's death.\nThe fresco also plays an important role in Richard Hayer's novel Visus, in Andrei Tarkovsky's 1983 film Nostalghia, and in the poem \"San Sepolcro\" by Jorie Graham. G\u00e9rard Grisey wrote a musical piece L'Ic\u00f4ne paradoxale as a tribute to Piero della Francesca and this work, borrowing the title from an essay by Yves Bonnefoy on the same subject.Piero della Francesca's Madonna has neither books nor royal attributes as in most previous versions of the image, nor does she wear the girdle. She is portrayed with a hand against her side to support her prominent belly. She is flanked by two angels, who are holding open the curtains of a pavilion decorated with pomegranates, a symbol of Christ's Passion. The upper part of the painting has been lost. The two angels are specular, as they were executed by the artist using the same perforated cartoons to copy them.\nThe theological symbolism behind the representation is complex. Maurizio Calvesi  has suggested that the tent represents the Ark of the Covenant. Mary would be thus the new Ark of Alliance in her role as Mother of Christ. For other scholars the tent is a symbol of the Catholic Church, and the Madonna would symbolize the tabernacle, as she is portrayed containing Jesus' body.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His mother, Victorine Grasseau, was a tragic actress and teacher of drama, while his father, Jean-Antoine Petipa, was among the most renowned Ballet Masters and pedagogues in Europe. At the time of Marius's birth, Jean Petipa was engaged as Premier danseur (Principal Male Dancer) to the Salle Bauveau (known today as the Op\u00e9ra de Marseille), and in 1819 he was appointed Ma\u00eetre de ballet to that theatre.\nMarius Petipa spent his early childhood traveling throughout Europe with his family, as his parents' professional engagements took them from city to city. By the time Marius was six years old, his family had settled in Brussels in what was then the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, where his father was appointed Ma\u00eetre de ballet and Premier danseur to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie. The young Marius received his general education at the Grand College in Brussels, while also attending the Brussels Conservatory where he studied music and learned to play the violin.\nJust as he had done with his other children, Jean Petipa began giving the young Marius lessons in ballet at the age of seven. At first the young boy resisted, caring very little for dance. Nevertheless, he soon came to love this art form that was so much the life and identity of his family, and he excelled quickly. At the age of nine Marius performed for the first time in a ballet production as a Savoyard in his father's staging of Pierre Gardel's 1800 ballet La Dansomanie in 1827.\nOn 25 August 1830, the Belgian Revolution erupted after a performance of Daniel Auber's opera La muette de Portici at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie, where Marius' father now served as Premier ma\u00eetre de ballet. The violent street fighting that followed caused all theatres to be shut down for a time, and consequently Jean Petipa found himself without a position. The Petipa family was left in dire straits for some years.\nThe Petipa family relocated to Bordeaux, France, in 1834 where Marius' father had secured the position of Premier ma\u00eetre de ballet to the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux. While in Bordeaux, Marius completed his ballet training under the great Auguste Vestris. By 1838 he was appointed Premier danseur to the Ballet de Nantes in Nantes, France. During his time in Nantes the young Petipa began to try his hand at choreography by creating a number of one-act ballets and divertissements.\nThe 21-year-old Marius Petipa accompanied his father on a tour of the United States with a group of French dancers in July 1839. Among the many engagements was a performance of Jean Coralli's La tarentule at the National Theatre on Broadway, being the first ballet performance ever seen in New York City. The tour proved to be a disaster, as many in the uncultured American audiences of that time had never before seen ballet. To add to the fiasco, the American impresario who arranged the engagements stole a large portion of the troupe's receipts and quickly disappeared without a trace. Upon leaving for France, Petipa's ticket only allowed him passage to Nantes, but instead of returning to that city he stowed away in the cabin of a woman he had seduced so that he could secure passage to Paris.\nBy 1840, Petipa had made his d\u00e9but with the ballet company of the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise in Paris. His first performance with this troupe was given as a benefit performance for the actress Rachel where he partnered the legendary ballerina Carlotta Grisi.

{"id": "20_940", "question": "Where did John Pym die?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_26618", "text": "The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket has defied a universally accepted interpretation. Scholar Scott Peeples wrote that it is \"at once a mock nonfictional exploration narrative, adventure saga, bildungsroman, hoax, largely plagiarized travelogue, and spiritual allegory\" and \"one of the most elusive major texts of American literature.\" Biographer James M. Hutchisson writes that the plot both \"soars to new heights of fictional ingenuity and descends to new lows of silliness and absurdity\".One reason for the confusion comes from many continuity errors throughout the novel. For example, Pym notes that breaking a bottle while trapped in the hold saved his life because the sound alerted Augustus to his presence while searching. However, Pym notes that Augustus did not tell him this until \"many years elapsed\", even though Augustus is dead eight chapters later. Nevertheless, much of the novel is carefully plotted. Novelist John Barth notes, for example, that the midway point of the novel occurs when Pym reaches the equator, the midway point of the globe.Scholar Shawn Rosenheim believes that the use of hieroglyphs in the novel served as a precursor to Poe's interest in cryptography. The pictographs themselves were likely inspired by The Kentuckian in New-York (1834) by William Alexander Caruthers, where similar writing is the work of a black slave. Unlike the previous sea-voyage tales that Poe had written, such as \"MS. Found in a Bottle\", Pym is undertaking this trip on purpose. It has been suggested that the journey is about establishing a national American identity as well as discovering a personal identity.Poe also presents the effects of alcohol in the novel. The opening episode, for example, shows that intoxicated people can sometimes seem entirely sober and then, suddenly, the effects of alcohol show through. Such a depiction is a small version of a larger focus in the novel on contradictions between chaos and order. Even nature seems unnatural.

In Berlin he could not reach a postdoctoral lecturer qualification because of his Jewish origin, so he became a private lecturer (Privatdozent) for political science and international law in Heidelberg.\nBut his inclinations to journalism soon won the upper hand, and, his living assured by his family, he gave up teaching.He was very much taken by the questions surrounding the movements of 1848.  His feeble attempts at practical politics nevertheless foundered and left him more and more to make himself known through his pen and his theories.  He spoke at the agitated mass meeting at Unter den Zelten where the legislature's petition to the king regarding the wishes of the people was discussed.  He became one of the chief editors, with Arnold Ruge and Eduard Meyen, of \u201cDie Reform\u201d (The Reform) which soon came under the oversight of several democratic groups. Among his other co-workers on this paper were Mikhail Bakunin, Karl Heinzen and Georg Herwegh. Oppenheim sought a seat in the National Assembly. He thought it sufficient to refer to his writings in \u201cDie Reform\u201d where he developed his premise \u201cthat only with freedom did the people become mature enough for freedom,\u201d but the people of Berlin had no patience with a candidate who campaigned only with his pen. This experience convinced him even more he that he was suited to a writing career, as he did not seem suited to speaking.He went to Baden and, looking for secrets, broke into the private files of the departed archduke.  Lorenzo Brentano, the leader of the provisional government, put him in charge of the government newspaper, the \u201cKarlsruher Zeitung\u201d.  When a schism broke out between Brentano's moderates and Gustav Struve's terrorists, Oppenheim worked for the latter, and was dismissed from the newspaper when they failed.  He then traveled to Switzerland, France, the Netherlands and England. He returned in 1850 and continued to publish works on democratic ideas.  He denounced the democrats for the victories of the Reaction, but thought the latter were ultimately to blame because they turned to raw despotic power rather than continuing with their phony constitutionalism.In 1861 Oppenheim joined the German Progress Party and edited the Yearbook for Politics and Literature which was banned soon afterwards. He also became a member of the Congress of German Economists, as he was known as an excellent economist and supporter of free trade. He also paid attention to social matters.\nThe occurrences of 1866 worked a great transformation in Oppenheim.  He greeted the new order with joy while other liberals were more skeptical.  Oppenheim joined the National Liberals and supported Bismarck's strategy for national unification. He wrote two flyers for the elections, one of which only saw limited distribution since the leaders saw it as too radical.  After 1870, for the first time he directly discussed practical questions, writing on poor laws and economics.  He was also critical of \u201cfanciful thinkers about the future among the teachers in the universities.\u201dIn the 1874 election, he was elected Member of the Reichstag representing Reu\u00df \u00e4. L. and took his seat as an expert on the 1869 changes to commercial regulations.  In 1877 he lost his seat to a social democrat.  In reaction to Bismarck's protectionist policy he split with his party in 1880.\nOppenheim's philosophical work is concentrated on parliamentarism the idea of common welfare.

Historian Michael Joseph Corcoran has stated that she was \"The Mother of Tejano Music\", an art form that is the uniquely Texas cultural amalgamation of traditional Mexican, Spanish, German, and Czech musical roots. She recorded on numerous labels over the course of her six-decade career of live performing. The aggregate total of her records numbers an estimated 200 different Spanish-language songs on at least 50 LP record albums. In 1977, she performed at the Inauguration of President Jimmy Carter, as part of the line-up for the Inaugural Folk Dance and Concert. Her most well-known tune was \"Mal Hombre\" (Bad Man), a song she had heard as a child.\nShe was born in Houston, Texas, into a Mexican musical family originally from San Luis Potos\u00ed. The family had fled Mexico at the onset of the Mexican Revolution, after which they returned home for two years. When she was four years old, the family once again immigrated to Texas. Although she lived most of her life in the United States, primarily Texas, she never spoke any language but Spanish. The family moved frequently to find work and entertained other migrant workers wherever they went.\nMendoza was known by many nicknames, such as \"La Alondra de la Frontera\" (The Meadowlark of the Border). In their early years of performing, \"La Familia Mendoza\" (the Mendoza family) would hitchhike around south Texas, performing for farm laborers. Answering an advertisement in a Spanish-language newspaper resulted in their first recording sessions with Okeh Records. She was only 12 years old, but Lydia provided vocals and played the mandolin for the recordings. They eventually caught the notice of San Antonio radio personality Manuel J. Cortez and were offered a recording contract with the RCA Victor subsidiary of Bluebird Records. During World War II, and for several years afterward, Mendoza and her sisters Juanita and Marie performed as Las Hermanas Mendoza (the Mendoza sisters). She fairly quickly emerged as the headliner of the group, but her family continued to perform with her as she toured. Not only did she perform throughout the United States, but also in Canada and Latin America, where her attendance records were estimated to be 20,000.\nShe was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1984, she was inducted into the Tejano Music Hall of Fame, and in 1991, into the Conjunto Music Hall of Fame. For her contributions to the performing arts, she was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. In 1999, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts by First Lady Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton, and in 2003 she was bestowed with the Texas Cultural Trust's Texas Medal of Arts. She designed and sewed her own stage costumes, and at one point was an instructor at California State University, Fresno. Mendoza was married twice and the mother of three daughters.

A survey conducted in the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) found Misirkov to be \"the most significant Macedonian of the 20th century\". For his efforts to codify a standard Macedonian language, he is often considered \"the founder of the modern Macedonian literary language\".On the other hand, he was one of the founders of the pro-Bulgarian Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Circle established in 1900 in St. Petersburg. In 1905 he began publishing predominantly articles, written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective in the IMARO-affiliated press. In his diary written during the Balkan Wars, he espoused pro-Bulgarian views. During the First World War, he became a member of the local parliament in Bessarabia as a representative of the Bulgarian minority there. During the 1920s he encouraged the Macedonian Slavs to adopt a Bulgarian national identity. Misirkov returned to Macedonian nationalism for a period in 1914 and again in 1924 and 1925. Misirkov died in 1926 and was buried in the Sofia Central Cemetery with the financial support from the Ministry of Education, as an honoured Bulgarian educator.\nBecause Misirkov expressed conflicting views about the national identity of the Macedonian Slavs at different points in his life, his national affiliation and legacy remain a matter of dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia. While Misirkov's work and personality remain highly controversial and disputed, there have been attempts among international scholars to reconcile the conflicting and self-contradictory statements made by Misirkov. According to historian Ivo Banac, Misirkov viewed both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians, and espoused pan-Bulgarian patriotism in a larger Balkan context. However, in the context of the larger Bulgarian unit/nation, Misirkov sought both cultural and national differentiation from the other Bulgarians and called both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia, Macedonians.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He also took measures to rationalize drug supply. On 4 September 1964, having one of the highest turnouts in Chilean history, Frei Montalva was elected President of the Republic of Chile. He took office two months later, on November 4.The Frei presidency did much to tackle poverty, as characterised by the growing share of wages as a proportion of GNP. By the end of the Frei presidency, the wage and salaried sector received close to 51% of GNP, compared with 42% at the end of the Alessandri presidency. This positive redistribution of wealth was encouraged by government policies, particularly in the rural sector, where wages rose by 40% in real terms. Between 1964 and 1970, total enrollment in education increased by 46%, while around 250,000 houses were built, mostly for the poor.Frei's administration also introduced a wealth tax and carried out a property tax reassessment in order to make the taxation system more progressive. Taxes as a percentage of GNP increased 12.8% in 1964 to 21.2% in 1970. The social reforms introduced by Frei's government led to a huge increase in public expenditure, which rose as a proportion of GNP from 35.7% in 1965 to 46.9% in 1970. Expenditures on education, agriculture, and housing rose went up considerably, with spending on housing increasing by 70% in real terms in 1965 alone.During Frei's six years in office, an average of 40,000 housing units were constructed each year, and a total of 100,000 lots were assigned. Investments in primary care clinics and hospitals were also carried out, with 20 clinics and 16 hospitals built between 1965 and 1969.In 1965, he started a presidential tour through France, the United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy and the Vatican. During this time, he also visited countries in Latin America such as: Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela; places where he delivered important speeches on international issues.On his return, he initiated important plans involving housing, education, reforestation, land reform, health, and the nationalization of copper. The Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Cultura (National Culture Commission), the Consejer\u00eda Nacional de la Promoci\u00f3n Popular and the Juntas de Vecinos (\u201cNeighborhood Committees\u201d) were also created.One area of reform given high priority by the Frei Administration was the fostering of networks of local, self-help organisations (especially among the \u201cunorganised\u201d residents of the shantytowns), which was placed under a national supervisory council. As a result of the government's actions, mothers' centres, sports associations, youth clubs, residents\u2019 committees, and parents' groups proliferated, with an estimated 20,000 units of this type in existence by 1970, according to government figures. Half of these new units were mothers' centres, with an estimated membership of 45,000 women, and the government claimed to have distributed 70,000 sewing machines to these centres. According to Frei, these measures had given \u201ca new form of life and hope\u201d to hundreds of thousands of people.\nImprovements were also made in areas such as housing, education and medical care. Between 1964 and 1970, around 260,000 houses were constructed (around a third by the state housing corporation CORVI) and about 200,000 housing solutions were claimed (referring to the provision of sites for self-help housing projects). The number of hospitals (and beds) doubled under the PDC, and spending on education as a proportion of public expenditure rose from one-seventh to one-fifth. Around 3,000 new schools were built throughout the country, and by 1970 95% of children in the relevant age group were covered by primary education. Expenditure on scholarships and school loans was doubled, and school enrollment was raised from 1.8 million to 2.9 million.Expenditure on education doubled, the number of years of basic education was increased from six to eight, and a two-shift school-day was introduced that doubled the capacity of the country's system. Frei's initiatives in education led to increased rates of enrollment in both primary and secondary education, with primary school coverage reaching 90% in the majority of rural and urban areas by 1970, while secondary school coverage reached 49% in 1970, compared with 18% at the start of the 1960s.A new law establishing work-accident and occupational disease insurance was signed into law in January 1968, providing for compulsory coverage of all salaried employees and wage earners, including apprentices and domestic servants. In March that year, a piece of legislation creating government-sponsored health insurance for public and private salaried employees and their dependents was signed into law.Basic health services were expanded with the training of community health workers, the building of rural health clinics, and the shifting of financial and personnel resources from hospitals to community health centres. These efforts contributed to a steep decline in infant mortality in Chile during the 1960s\u20131970s.Much attention was also given to the improvement of social and economic conditions in the countryside. Both rural unionisation and agrarian reform were accelerated, with the government starting to expropriate estates in a serious way. Family allowance for farmers was doubled, the agricultural minimum wage was raised to the same level as its urban equivalent, and an agrarian reform law signed by Frei in July 1967 made all farms of more than eighty \u201cbasic\u201d hectares liable to expropriation. The Frei Administration had thus made a major start to land reform, a policy continued by the Allende Government.The agrarian reform carried out by the Frei Government organized the reformed sector according to a temporary system established in the law, whereby the expropriated estates became asentamientos. This was a legal form in which the farm operated as a joint enterprise between the state and the peasants who had lived in the former latifundia (extensive agricultural estates), with the state providing the credits, land, and technical assistance, and the peasants their labor. After an indeterminate period, the land would be made available for subdivision into small private plots, if the peasants wished. According to one study, the percentage of the population living below the poverty line steadily fell; from 39% in 1965 to 17% in 1970.During his administration 8 workers were killed in El Salvador mine and 11 squatters in the Massacre of Puerto Montt. His Minister of the Interior, Edmundo P\u00e9rez Zujovic was politically blamed for the deaths. On 21 October 1969 the Tacnazo insurrection, occurred\u2014a brief non-violent demonstration of the Tacna artillery regiment in Santiago, led by General Roberto Viaux.In 1966, the Andean Group, officially created through its Declaration, signed in January 1965. However, the group culminated with the famous speech delivered by Frei Montalva in Plaza Bol\u00edvar, Bogota. The same year the pacts on Chilean copper were signed.In January 1967 the National Congress refused his constitutional permission to travel to the United States where he had been invited by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In April 1967, he participated in the Meeting of Presidents from American countries, carried out in Montevideo, Uruguay.In 1970, he was awarded with the Doctor Honoris Causa title by the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile.

His dissertation, \u00dcber die Zerlegung der endlichen Gruppen in indirekte unzerlegbare Faktoren (\"On the decomposition of a finite group into indirect indecomposable factors\") established that any two decompositions of a finite group into a direct product are related by a central automorphism. A weaker form of this statement, uniqueness, was first proved by Joseph Wedderburn in 1909. Later the theorem was generalized by Wolfgang Krull and Otto Schmidt to some classes of infinite groups and became known as the Krull\u2013Schmidt theorem or the Krull\u2013Remak\u2013Schmidt theorem.\nAlthough the dissertation was first submitted in 1911, it was rejected several times and Remak did not obtain his Habilitation until 1929. In the meantime, he wrote several papers on the geometry of numbers. Between 1929 and 1933 Remak lectured as a Privatdozent at Humboldt University. In the 1929 essay Kann die Volkwirtschaftslehre eine exakte Wissenschaft werden? (\"Can economics become an exact science?\"), Remak analyzed price formation in socialist and capitalist economies. He also anticipated the role played by digital computers in numerical solution of systems of linear equations. Remak's analysis may have influenced John von Neumann, who was a fellow lecturer in Berlin, but most of it has not been translated into English and it remains little known and appreciated in the English-speaking world. In 1932 Remak published a paper giving a lower bound for the regulator of an algebraic number field in terms of the numbers r1 and r2 of real embeddings and pairs of complex embeddings.

In the army of Hesse-Cassel, he was a lieutenant general. In 1776, with 42 years of military experience, he came to the Thirteen Colonies of British North America as second-in-command of an army of 12,000 men called \"Hessians\" under General Heister.Knyphausen led the Hessian troops in the Battles of White Plains, Fort Washington, Brandywine, Germantown, Springfield, and Monmouth. In 1779 and 1780, he commanded British-held New York City. When Heister left for Germany, Knyphausen took command of the German troops serving under Sir William Howe.  Because of Knyphausen's seniority, British officers held dormant commissions outranking him in case the British commander became disabled.  Despite this, Knyphausen was trusted by his British superiors.\nKnyphausen's regiment took part in the attack on Fort Washington and was in garrison at Trenton, New Jersey.  Major von Dechow, who was in command in late 1776, warned Colonel Johann Rall to fortify the town, advice that was ignored.  During the Battle of Trenton the regiment tried to escape across Assunpink Creek but was forced to surrender.  Dechow was mortally wounded during the battle.\nSir William Howe gave Knyphausen responsibility for commanding the right flank at the Brandywine, tasked with keeping the attention of the Continental commanders on the river line at Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania.  He also commanded the vanguard of the army withdrawing from Philadelphia at the time of the Battle of Monmouth.\nFor several years the main body of Knyphausen's force occupied the upper part of Manhattan Island, and during the temporary absence of Sir Henry Clinton in 1780, he was in command of the city.Knyphausen's regiment served in the Americas from 1776 to 1783. \nKnyphausen left the North American theater in 1782 in part because of ill health, including blindness in one eye caused by a cataract.

As he frequently declared, on such forces a judicious commander could place little reliance; they dwindled less by death than by desertion.In 1785, shortly after the end of the war, General Lafayette travelled to Cassel and met Knyphausen.
