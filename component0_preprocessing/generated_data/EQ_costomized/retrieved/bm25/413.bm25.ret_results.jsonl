But, Bob transcended more than that era. In this day of free agency and switching teams, Bob Feller remained loyal to the city and the team for over 70 years. You will likely not see that kind of mutual loyalty and admiration ever again.\" In 2010, the \"Cleveland Indians Man of the Year Award\" was renamed the \"Bob Feller Man of the Year Award\".On Opening Day of the 2011 season, the Indians invited Feller's widow, Anne, to present a silent first pitch. During pregame introductions, Cleveland players wore a No. 19 jersey in honor of Feller. For the entire 2011 season the players' uniforms were outfitted with an outline of Feller's pitching motion. The organization also made a permanent memorial of the press-box seat that Feller used in later life.The Bob Feller Museum opened in Feller's birthplace, Van Meter, Iowa, on June 10, 1995. Designed by Feller's son Stephen, on land donated by Brenton Banks, the museum had two rooms that contained Feller memorabilia and items from his own collection. The Feller bat used by Babe Ruth when he made his last public appearance at Yankee Stadium is at the museum. Feller said a teammate had stolen the bat and eventually it was purchased by the Upper Deck sports card company for $107,000. Feller later offered the company $95,000 in return for the bat. Following Feller's death in 2010, the museum faced serious funding issues. In 2015, with family approval, the Bob Feller Museum was donated to the city of Van Meter for use as the city hall. Some artifacts remain on permanent exhibit and can be viewed free of charge.In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award was created to honor the life of Feller.

It comprises four Kurdish-majority divisions of Arab-majority Iraq: the Erbil Governorate, the Sulaymaniyah Governorate, the Duhok Governorate, and Halabja Governorate. The KRI is bordered by Iran to the east, by Turkey to the north, and by Syria to the west. It does not govern all of Iraqi Kurdistan, and lays claim to the disputed territories of northern Iraq; these territories have a predominantly non-Arab population and were subject to the Ba'athist Arabization campaigns throughout the late 20th century. Though the KRI's autonomy was realized in 1992, one year after Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War, these northern territories remain contested between the Kurdistan Regional Government (in Erbil) and the Government of Iraq (in Baghdad) to the present day. In light of the dispute, the KRI's constitution declares the city of Kirkuk as the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. However, the KRI does not control Kirkuk, and the Kurdistan Region Parliament is based in Erbil. In 2014, when the Syria-based Islamic State began their Northern Iraq offensive and invaded the country, the Iraqi Armed Forces retreated from most of the disputed territories. The KRI's Peshmerga then entered and took control of them for the duration of the War in Iraq (2013\u20132017). In October 2017, following the defeat of the Islamic State, the Iraqi Armed Forces attacked the Peshmerga and reasserted control over the disputed territories.Throughout the 20th century, Iraqi Kurds oscillated between fighting for autonomy and for full independence. Under the Ba'athist regime, the Kurds experienced Arabization and genocidal campaigns at the hands of the federal government in Baghdad. However, when the United States, the United Kingdom, and France established the Iraqi no-fly zones, which restricted the federal government's power in the country's northern and southern areas following the Gulf War, the Kurds were given a chance to experiment with self-governance and the autonomous region was de facto established. The Iraqi government only recognized the autonomy of the Kurdistan Region in 2005, after the American-led 2003 invasion of Iraq overthrew Saddam Hussein. In September 2017, the KRI passed a non-binding independence referendum, inviting mixed reactions internationally. The KRI largely escaped the privations that afflicted other parts of Iraq in the last years of Saddam Hussein's rule as well as the chaos that followed his ousting during the Iraq War (2003\u20132011), and built a parliamentary democracy with a growing economy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, in Garden of Shadows, it is spelled \"Corinne\". Garden of Shadows was written by ghostwriter Andrew Neiderman.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine and her four children arrive at Foxworth Hall in the month of June to August, yet in this book, light snow is falling when they arrive.\nThere is a slight confusion as to when the children arrived at Foxworth Hall. Cathy mentions that they had been in the attic for 3 years, 4 months, and 16 days (POTW- p 18). They left on 10 Nov 1960 meaning they arrived about 24 June 1957. Yet in Flowers in the Attic chapters \"Goodbye Daddy\" to \"Roads to Riches\", the dad dies in early May and it is implied that a few months passed before they abandoned the house in Gladstone. Also on page 231, it's mentioned that \"August had come and gone. We have been in this prison a full year.\"\nThe dollhouse that belongs to Olivia stays at her old house. There is no mention of it ever arriving at Foxworth Hall, as it does in Flowers in the Attic.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Christopher Sr. dies at age 36; in Garden of Shadows, he dies at age 35. (This may be because it was his birthday.)\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells her children that Olivia was abused by her mother (she was locked in a closet, causing Olivia's claustrophobia and unwillingness to go into the attic), while in \"Shadows\" Olivia recounts a warm and loving relationship with a gentle mother, and goes into the attic several times, especially once when she has Alicia captive in there. \"Shadows\" does mention that Olivia's mother locked her in the closet as punishment when she misbehaved.\nIn Garden of Shadows, Malcolm Jr. dies at Foxworth Hall in a motorcycle accident; in Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells her children that he died at a cabin he had built. Differences lie in the location of death and who was present. (However, it is possible that Corrine either misremembered the circumstances regarding her brother\u2019s death as it had been years between his passing and her confession, or she lied to her children.)\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells her children that Joel ran away from home and sent a single postcard, while in Garden of Shadows, Olivia mentions many newspaper clippings were sent home. Corrine recalls Joel saying goodbye to his parents, while she was not present in Garden of Shadows.\nIn Garden of Shadows, Olivia mentions her loving relationship with Corrine, while in Flowers in the Attic, Olivia proudly states that she thought Corrine to be trash from birth (although it is possible that she is lying or just disgusted by what Corrine did).\nIn Flowers in the Attic Olivia screams at Cathy and Chris that their parents eloped secretly and came back to ask forgiveness for falling in love. However, in Garden of Shadows, Olivia catches Christopher Sr. and Corrine making love.  This leads to a confrontation with Malcolm and Olivia, after which Christopher and Corrine willingly flee Foxworth Hall.\nIn Flowers in the Attic Corrine tells Cathy that she was 12, and out bike riding when she got her first period, while in Garden Of Shadows Corrine is 14 and proudly shares the news with her mother.\nGarden of Shadows does not mention Olivia's ever-present diamond brooch, nor any close friends that make her gray dresses (Flowers in the Attic). In fact, Garden of Shadows says that Olivia had no friends in Virginia, finding the women too weak, frivolous, and nasty for her liking.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, when confronted by Cathy, Corrine reveals that Malcolm wrote on a letter to her, in reply for her pleas for help after Chris Sr. dies, that the only thing good about their (Chris Sr. and Corrine's) marriage was the fact it didn't create any devil's issue (inbred children). In Garden of Shadows, Olivia says that she writes the letter, and Malcolm does not write anything on it. Also, Olivia does not let Malcolm know about the children, knowing that Malcolm would be bewitched by their beauty, especially the girls, and would not punish the children for the evil that their parents have done. (It is likely that Corrine may have been lying to keep her children under control and conspired with Olivia to keep Malcolm unaware of their existence.)\nOlivia's son Malcolm Jr. is nicknamed \"Mal\" to differentiate him from his father. The earlier books in the series stated that he was known as \"Mel.\"\nGarden of Shadows shows that John Amos meets Corrine for the first time when she is 14, while it is mentioned in If There be Thorns that she was 10.\nIn Garden of Shadows, Christopher is named Christopher Garland Foxworth. In Flowers in the Attic, his name is Garland Christopher Foxworth the Fourth.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells the children that her parents had forced her and her brothers to attend church every Sunday no matter what. In Garden of Shadows, there is no mention of the family ever attending church.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine tells the children that she and her brothers were forbidden from being exposed to each other, which includes swimming together because her mother said it was a sin and was abused if they disobeyed. In Garden of Shadows, Olivia does not mind it and even lets Corrine swim with Christopher. There is no mention of Corrine being abused but the boys are disciplined by their father who whips them and verbally abuses them.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Olivia expresses hatred towards her grandchildren because of their incestuous conception, even physically and emotionally abusing them. In Garden of Shadows, she feels drawn to them and actually wanted to love them, but decided against it because of what their parents had done. She may be keeping this in mind in her treatment of the children in the first novel.\nIn Flowers in the Attic and in previous novels, Corrine maintains that she was abused by her father. But in Garden of Shadows, Corrine was doted on and spoiled by her father. She may have reconsidered his treatment in retrospect.\nIn Flowers in the Attic, Corrine writes several letters to her parents asking for help. In Garden of Shadows, Olivia responds back to Corrine after the first letter arrives.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "413_26", "question": "What position does Robbie Moore play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27704", "text": "The initial premise of the series was to examine what superheroes would be like \"in a credible, real world\". As the story became more complex, Moore said Watchmen became about \"power and about the idea of the superman manifest within society.\" The title of the series refers to the question \"Who will watch the watchmen themselves?\", famously posed by the Roman satirist Juvenal (as \"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\"), although Moore was not aware of the phrase's classical origins until Harlan Ellison informed him. Moore commented in 1987, \"In the context of Watchmen, that fits. 'They're watching out for us, who's watching out for them?'\" The writer stated in the introduction to the Graffiti hardcover of Watchmen that while writing the series he was able to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes, and instead he found an interest in real human beings.\nBradford Wright described Watchmen as \"Moore's obituary for the concept of heroes in general and superheroes in particular.\" Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore's \"admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate\". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to \"the Reagans, Thatchers, and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process\". Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be \"not anti-Americanism, [but] anti-Reaganism\", specifically believing that \"at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable.\" Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: \"There's no overt political message at all. It's a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen and if people can see things in it that apply to the real America, then they're reading it into the comic [...].\" While Moore wanted to write about \"power politics\" and the \"worrying\" times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would \"switch off\" if he attacked a leader they admired. Moore stated in 1986 that he \"was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy.\"Citing Watchmen as the point where the comic book medium \"came of age\", Iain Thomson wrote in his essay \"Deconstructing the Hero\" that the story accomplished this by \"developing its heroes precisely in order to deconstruct the very idea of the hero and so encouraging us to reflect upon its significance from the many different angles of the shards left lying on the ground\". Thomson stated that the heroes in Watchmen almost all share a nihilistic outlook, and that Moore presents this outlook \"as the simple, unvarnished truth\" to \"deconstruct the would-be hero's ultimate motivation, namely, to provide a secular salvation and so attain a mortal immortality\". He wrote that the story \"develops its heroes precisely in order to ask us if we would not in fact be better off without heroes\". Thomson added that the story's deconstruction of the hero concept \"suggests that perhaps the time for heroes has passed\", which he feels distinguishes \"this postmodern work\" from the deconstructions of the hero in the existentialism movement. Richard Reynolds states that without any supervillains in the story, the superheroes of Watchmen are forced to confront \"more intangible social and moral concerns\", adding that this removes the superhero concept from the normal narrative expectations of the genre. Reynolds concludes that the series' ironic self-awareness of the genre \"all mark out Watchmen either as the last key superhero text, or the first in a new maturity of the genre\".Geoff Klock eschewed the term \"deconstruction\" in favor of describing Watchmen as a \"revisionary superhero narrative\". He considers Watchmen and Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns to be \"the first instances [...] of [a] new kind of comic book [...] a first phase of development, the transition of the superhero from fantasy to literature.\" He elaborates by noting that \"Alan Moore's realism [...] performs a kenosis towards comic book history [...] [which] does not ennoble and empower his characters [...] Rather, it sends a wave of disruption back through superhero history [...] devalue[ing] one of the basic superhero conventions by placing his masked crime fighters in a realistic world\". First and foremost, \"Moore's exploration of the [often compromised] motives for costumed crimefighting sheds a disturbing light on past superhero stories, and forces the reader to reevaluate\u2014to revision\u2014every superhero in terms of Moore's kenosis\u2014his emptying out of the tradition\". Klock relates the title to the quote by Juvenal to highlight the problem of controlling those who hold power and quoted repeatedly within the work itself. The deconstructive nature of Watchmen is, Klock notes, played out on the page also as, \"[l]ike Alan Moore's kenosis, [Veidt] must destroy, then reconstruct, in order to build 'a unity which would survive him.'\"Moore has expressed dismay that \"[t]he gritty, deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic, as exemplified by Watchmen [...] became a genre\". He said in 2003 that \"to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since Watchmen, an awful lot of the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use Watchmen to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don't have a lot to recommend them\". Gibbons said that while readers \"were left with the idea that it was a grim and gritty kind of thing\", he said in his view the series was \"a wonderful celebration of superheroes as much as anything else\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

He used to talk about the upper partials clashing together. It was very slow moving, it was much more about sounds slowly morphing into other sounds... It was... like what you would call electroacoustic improvisation now. His trio music, even though it had bass and drums, moved at a very slow pace. It had a sort of groove, but it was very different. And he operated differently. His rhetoric was very different. I don't think he ever thought of himself as a jazz musician; he just saw himself as a musician. He was a very dignified, incredibly brilliant guy. He would never lower himself to some mere label.\" Morris added: \"He was so brilliant in the way he spoke about things; it was impossible to dismiss it as just crazy talk. Even though at first it sounded like that, over time I understood what he was talking about, and we could have conversations.

The artist is driven to pursue and formulate successive objective forms. That is the only way to cross the river and stay alive in the current. It is a form of achievement and 'success' that is incomprehensible to the normative path because it comes at great personal cost, [does not] include social status, accumulation of material goods, praise and adulation, or even a supportive social network.

Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation's history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.Barker also had commercial interests, and was motivated by a drive for artistic and financial success. In this vein, the play was an attempt to please the anglophile public, but create something truly American in setting and theme. The portrayals of the Indians in the play, from a perspective of racial sensitivity, have been met with mixed reviews by modern critics.  Some write positively about the portrayals, saying that, other than Grimosco and Miami, the natives are noble, though primitive, and have a more \"American\" value system than the savages traditionally portrayed in British media of the period. Others, however, see the characters portrayed stereotypically as lusty, childlike, weak and corruptible beings, with the exceptions of Pocahontas and Nantaquas, who are portrayed positively only because they accept English values.  Still others take a middle ground, noting the range of representations.  In any case, the play can be seen as a justification of White assimilation of the natives, especially when examining Pocahontas's choice to be with Rolfe as a microcosm of their societies.Critics have pointed out several inherent flaws in the script, including the early placement of the play's climax (Smith at the chopping block) at the beginning of Act II, loose construction,  song lyrics that trivialize characters, and a main character in Pocahontas that is somewhat stilted and overly poetic.  In contrast, however others have argued that Pocahontas's love scene in Act III is where the truest poetry of the piece emerges.There has been less critique of Bray's musical work, but Victor Fell Yellin tried to recreate what he felt was the score's melodic expressiveness and sonorous grandeur in his 1978 recording of it. In the liner notes, he points out that the music does not critically compare with the great musical masters of its time, but its success is derived from its charm. While it lacks modulation, it contains well-turned melodic and rhythmic phrases, and syncopations that add to its American style.The Indian Princess certainly began a long American tradition of romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, who was only a child in Smith's original accounts. Therefore, it deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre, but it can be criticized for diminishing the potential richness of the subject matter.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the meantime, he worked as a substitute teacher at Coakley Middle School in his hometown, where he earned $50 a day.In 1996, he was drafted in the 17th round (103rd overall) by the Rhein Fire of the World League of American Football (WLAF), based on the recommendation of kicking coordinator Doug Blevins, who had seen Araguz during his tryouts with the Dolphins and Chargers. He had 41 punts for a 42.3-yard average (second in the league). He also was the kicker for the field goals (8-of-15 for a 53.3%), while international player Manfred Burgsm\u00fcller kicked the extra points.In 1996, the Oakland Raiders stalwart punter Jeff Gossett was lost for the season with four broken ribs he suffered in the twelfth game against the Seattle Seahawks. Araguz was tried out along with other punters, but lost out to Rich Camarillo, who pulled a groin muscle during warm-ups for his first game against the Miami Dolphins, which gave Araguz the opportunity to punt in the final three games of the season. His first punt went for 52 yards against the Kansas City Chiefs. His production of 13 punts for 534 yards (41-yard avg.) gave the Raiders confidence to release Gossett on February 14, 1997. In 1997, he finished fifth in the league with 4,189 punting yards, and his 45-yards average ranked second in franchise history, behind the 45.3-yards per punt average set by Pro Football Hall of Famer Ray Guy in 1973. In 1998, he set the NFL record for the most punts in a single-game (16), in a 7\u20136 win over the San Diego Chargers on October 11. In that game, Araguz made a solo tackle of Chargers punt returner Latario Rachal, preventing a likely touchdown on a sequence where the Chargers instead settled for a field goal. In 2000, the Raiders drafted punter Shane Lechler in the fifth round and released Araguz on August 27.In 2001, he played for the New York/New Jersey Hitmen in the XFL, posting 44 punts for 1,788\tyards (40.6-yard avg.).\nOn June 14, 2001, he signed with the St. Louis Rams.

He spent several seasons in junior before getting drafted, and played for the Yorkton Terriers of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, as well as the Great Falls Americans, Spokane Flyers and Seattle Breakers of the Western Hockey League.  He was called up to the Devils for the start of the 1983\u201384 season, but cracked his fibula during a game against the Hartford Whalers and missed over 40 games.  After his injury healed, he was assigned to the Kamloops Junior Oilers of the WHL for the remainder of the season.Upon his arrival in the NHL, Daneyko established himself as a stay-at-home defenceman, and soon won fans over with his gritty and self-sacrificing play. Daneyko was also known for his missing front teeth, lost after he was hit in the mouth by a puck.  His gap-toothed smile was well known not only by Devils supporters, but by hockey fans around the world.  As a player who had spent all of his NHL career with New Jersey, Daneyko was nicknamed \"Mr. Devil\".  He is also referred to by the nickname \"Dano\".\n\nDaneyko acquired over 2,500 penalty minutes in his career, finishing a season with over 200 penalty minutes five times.  Daneyko was never a high-scoring defenceman, and set a record by playing in 255 consecutive regular-season games without scoring a goal.  In his highest-scoring season, 1989\u201390, he scored six goals and 15 assists en route to a 21-point season.  In six seasons he scored no goals at all. He also has the lowest point per game average among all NHL players who played at least 1,000 games with 0.138. However, Daneyko's effectiveness was not measured by how many pucks he put in the net, but by how many pucks he kept out.  Daneyko was used primarily as a shadow defenceman, and often got physical in front of the net if a forward parked himself in the crease looking for a rebound.\nIn the late 1990s, Daneyko struggled with alcoholism while general manager Lou Lamoriello and Devils owner John McMullen stood by him and checked him into rehab. On November 1, 1997, Daneyko became the first player to enter the NHL's voluntary Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health program, which was created in 1996. Daneyko recovered and played every game of New Jersey's successful 2000 playoffs, winning the Bill Masterton Trophy in 2000.\nAlong with Scott Stevens, he was part of a tough Devils defensive core that won the Stanley Cup three times, in 1995, 2000 and 2003. From the team's first playoff game while in New Jersey, in 1988, Daneyko played in every playoff game until game four of the 2003 quarterfinals. He also was scratched in the first six games of the 2003 finals, but, looking for a spark, coach Pat Burns inserted Daneyko into the lineup for game seven, replacing Oleg Tverdovsky. As a reward to his devotion of the team, and a hint of his impending retirement, Daneyko took the ice for the final shift of the Devils' game seven victory over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, which clinched their third Stanley Cup victory, in 2003.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The clapper is a metal sphere approximately 4 mm (3\u204416 in) in diameter suspended between the piles, which rings the bells alternately due to electrostatic forces. When the clapper touches one bell, it is charged by that pile. It is then repelled from that bell due to having the same charge and attracted to the other bell, which has the opposite charge. The clapper then touches the other bell and the process reverses, leading to oscillation. The use of electrostatic forces means that while high voltage is required to create motion, only a tiny amount of charge is carried from one bell to the other. As a result, the batteries drain very slowly, which is why the piles have been able to last since the apparatus was set up in 1840. Its oscillation frequency is 2 hertz.The exact composition of the dry piles is unknown, but it is known that they have been coated with molten sulfur for insulation and it is thought that they may be Zamboni piles.At one point this sort of device played an important role in distinguishing between two different theories of electrical action: the theory of contact tension (an obsolete scientific theory based on then-prevailing electrostatic principles) and the theory of chemical action.The Oxford Electric Bell does not demonstrate perpetual motion. The bell will eventually stop when the dry piles have distributed their charges equally if the clapper does not wear out first.

In the celebration that immediately followed, he was embraced by members of the Curse-breaking, title-winning Sox such as Tim Wakefield, Curt Schilling and Kevin Millar as a living representative of past Red Sox stars whose teams had fallen short of winning the Fall Classic, at times literally at the final hurdle. As John Powers wrote for the Boston Globe, \"Pesky was the stand-in for all of the Towne Teamers who'd gotten to the World Series and fell short. For teammate Ted Williams, who wept in the clubhouse after batting .200 in 1946. For Jim Lonborg, who won two games with brilliant pitching in 1967 but was battered on two days' rest in the finale. For Carl Yastrzemski, who played on two teams that lost the Series in the seventh game. And for Bill Buckner, who had the grounder go between his legs in 1986.\"He played a poignant and prominent role in the ceremony in which the World Series Championship Rings were handed out (April 11, 2005, before the Red Sox home season opener against the Yankees) \u2013 and he himself was awarded the World Series ring that had eluded him as a player and manager. Bill Simmons, who was present that day, wrote for ESPN in a column that was republished in Now I Can Die In Peace that Pesky received the biggest cheer as a living \"reminder of everything that had happened since 1918.\" (As others had pointed out, not only had Pesky been the shortstop during Slaughter's Mad Dash, but he had been born within six months of the 1918 World Series and his wife was named Ruth.) With the help of Carl Yastrzemski, he raised the 2004 World Series Championship banner up the Fenway Park center field flagpole. After the Red Sox swept the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series, Pesky once again received a ring and was given the honor of raising the newest Red Sox championship banner on April 8, 2008.\n\nOn his 87th birthday, September 27, 2006, the Red Sox honored Pesky by officially naming the right-field foul pole \"Pesky's Pole\", although it had already been unofficially known as such. On September 23, 2008, the Red Sox announced that they would retire the number 6 Pesky wore as a player to mark his 89th birthday and his long years of service to the club. (Pesky wore #22 as the team's manager in the 1960s, and #35 as a coach from 1975 to 1980. Although he reclaimed #6 and wore it from 1981 to 1984, between 1985 and its retirement the number also was assigned to players such as Bill Buckner, Rick Cerone, Damon Berryhill and Tony Pe\u00f1a.)Pesky's was the sixth number retired by the Red Sox; his number retired was the first to break the club's code to have a number retired: being in the Baseball Hall of Fame and having spent at least ten years with the Red Sox (Pesky has not been selected for the Hall of Fame).Pesky was a longtime resident of Boston's North Shore, living in Lynn and then Swampscott, Massachusetts. He was a visible member of the community, making personal appearances for the Red Sox. For years, he was a commercial spokesman on television and radio for a local supplier of doors and windows, JB Sash and Door Company. The commercials were deliberately and humorously corny, with Pesky and the company's owner calling themselves \"the Window Boys.\"On May 16, 2009, Pesky was given an honorary degree during Salem State College's 199th commencement ceremony. On April 20, 2012, Boston Red Sox fans celebrated the 100th birthday of Fenway Park, and Johnny Pesky was a participant. He was wheeled out to second base in a wheelchair, aside Bobby Doerr, to join over 200 past Red Sox players and coaches through the decades.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "413_224", "question": "What position does Steve Shields play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27223", "text": "The Indian Princess is one example of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American national identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation's history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.Barker also had commercial interests, and was motivated by a drive for artistic and financial success. In this vein, the play was an attempt to please the anglophile public, but create something truly American in setting and theme. The portrayals of the Indians in the play, from a perspective of racial sensitivity, have been met with mixed reviews by modern critics.  Some write positively about the portrayals, saying that, other than Grimosco and Miami, the natives are noble, though primitive, and have a more \"American\" value system than the savages traditionally portrayed in British media of the period. Others, however, see the characters portrayed stereotypically as lusty, childlike, weak and corruptible beings, with the exceptions of Pocahontas and Nantaquas, who are portrayed positively only because they accept English values.  Still others take a middle ground, noting the range of representations.  In any case, the play can be seen as a justification of White assimilation of the natives, especially when examining Pocahontas's choice to be with Rolfe as a microcosm of their societies.Critics have pointed out several inherent flaws in the script, including the early placement of the play's climax (Smith at the chopping block) at the beginning of Act II, loose construction,  song lyrics that trivialize characters, and a main character in Pocahontas that is somewhat stilted and overly poetic.  In contrast, however others have argued that Pocahontas's love scene in Act III is where the truest poetry of the piece emerges.There has been less critique of Bray's musical work, but Victor Fell Yellin tried to recreate what he felt was the score's melodic expressiveness and sonorous grandeur in his 1978 recording of it. In the liner notes, he points out that the music does not critically compare with the great musical masters of its time, but its success is derived from its charm. While it lacks modulation, it contains well-turned melodic and rhythmic phrases, and syncopations that add to its American style.The Indian Princess certainly began a long American tradition of romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, who was only a child in Smith's original accounts. Therefore, it deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre, but it can be criticized for diminishing the potential richness of the subject matter.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "413_246", "question": "What position does Fred Strickland play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_15452", "text": "Fred's personality was based on those of early television's Ralph Kramden of The Honeymooners and Chester A. Riley of The Life of Riley, both roles held at various times by Jackie Gleason. (Riley was more closely associated with William Bendix, who originated the role, though Gleason replaced Bendix due to a contract dispute for The Life of Riley's first season on television.) Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, temperamental and constantly scheming ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor Barney Rubble. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including Archie Bunker from All in the Family and Archie Bunker's Place (both played by Carroll O'Connor), George Jefferson from The Jeffersons (played by Sherman Hemsley), Mel Sharples from Alice (played by Vic Tayback) and Frank DeFazio from Laverne & Shirley (played by Phil Foster).\nFred's interests include bowling, playing pool, golf, poker and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take ballet lessons in order to improve his game (hence his trademark bowling delivery). The nickname of \"Twinkletoes\" stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his call sign. Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named \"the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs\" in an early episode). Fred also has a serious gambling problem; the mere mention of the word \"bet\" causes Fred to stammer \"bet\" over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges. Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode \"Indianrockolis 500\", Fred entered the famed prehistoric auto race under the pseudonym \"Goggles Paisano\".Fred's catchphrase is \"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!\"; Alan Reed, voice actor who provided Fred's voice from 1960 to 1977, reportedly said the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, \"A little dab'll do ya,\" probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple yahoo, Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called \"Yabba Dabba Dew\" and may or may not have also inspired George Jetson's similar-sounding catchphrase, \"Hooba-dooba-dooba\" (or \"Hooba-Dooba\"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by Hoagy Carmichael which the singer-songwriter performs in one episode of The Flintstones. Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled drummer) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend \"Hot Lips Hannigan\" where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed the \"Golden Smog\". In another first-season episode, \"Girls' Night Out\", Fred recorded a demo record at a carnival of the song \"Listen to the Rocking Bird\", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named \"Hi Fye\". As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred's voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing. (Alan Reed himself was not a good singer; in instances where he was expected to sing well, a stand-in\u2014usually Henry Corden from 1965 onward\u2014would be used.)Due to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred puts the Flintstones housecat \"Baby Puss\" outside; the cat however jumps back inside and puts Fred out who begins to knock on the door of his house and starts yelling \"Wilma\", to open the door.\nAccording to the original series' third-season episode \"The Birthday Party\" (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred's birthday is February 2. Fred's address has varied through the series' run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including, 201 Cobblestone Lane (October 21, 1960 - \"No Help Wanted\" episode), 345 Cave Stone Road, 39 Stone Canyon Way, and 1313 Cobblestone Way. Fred's address was cited as \"35 Cobblestone Rd\" in the 1961 episode \"The X-Ray Story\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

On December 5, 1978, before having played a full season in the majors, he was traded, along with Phil Lansford (minors), to the Toronto Blue Jays for V\u00edctor Cruz. Griffin made an immediate impact, sharing the American League Rookie of the Year Award in 1979 with John Castino.\nIn 1980, Griffin led the majors in triples, tying Willie Wilson of the Kansas City Royals with 15; both Griffin and Wilson set an AL record for most triples in a single season by a switch-hitter. Five years later in 1985, Wilson himself shattered the record that he shared with Griffin by tallying 21 triples.In 1984, Griffin was named to the All-Star team.  This was explained by John Feinstein of The Washington Post as: \"Making the All-Star team the hard way: Major league baseball pays the expenses for each player here and for one guest. In most cases, players bring wives or girlfriends. D\u00e1maso Garc\u00eda, the Toronto Blue Jays' second baseman, brought his shortstop, Alfredo Griffin. When the Tigers' Alan Trammell hurt his arm and could not play tonight, Manager Joe Altobelli named Griffin to the team, partly because he's a fine player, but mostly because he was here.\"Griffin spent six years with the Blue Jays from 1979 to 1984, playing in 392 consecutive games. He was traded after the 1984 season to the Oakland Athletics, where, despite his reluctance to draw walks and a tendency to be overaggressive on the basepaths, he began to harness the offensive promise that he showed in 1980. Griffin won the American League Gold Glove Award in 1985.After establishing personal bests in most offensive categories with the Athletics, Griffin was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Bob Welch prior to the 1988 season. The three-team trade, which included the New York Mets, also netted the Dodgers Jay Howell and Jesse Orosco. All three teams involved in the deal would go on to win their respective divisions in 1988. A Dwight Gooden fastball broke Griffin's hand in May 1988, and Griffin was disabled for much of 1988 and part of 1989. He missed most of the 1988 season, but the Dodgers won the World Series, and he was awarded a championship ring.\nIn 1990, Griffin became the last player to finish last in the National League, of those who qualified for the batting title, in batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage.\nGriffin returned to Toronto in 1992 and was a bench player as the Blue Jays won the first of two consecutive championships. On October 23, 1993, he stood on deck as Joe Carter faced Mitch Williams in the ninth inning of Game Six. His career came to an end moments later when Carter homered to win the World Series for Toronto.\nGriffin was the first player in major league history to have started three times for the opposing line-ups in a perfect game: against Len Barker (Cleveland) in 1981 for the Toronto Blue Jays, then against Tom Browning (Cincinnati) in 1988 and Dennis Mart\u00ednez (Montreal) in 1991, both for the Los Angeles Dodgers.Griffin ended his 18-year playing career with a .249 batting average, 24 home runs, 527 runs batted in, and a 67 OPS+ in 1,962 games played.

He was all-Pac-10 honorable mention in 2007 and was invited to the East West Shrine Game and the Hula Bowl. Williams career stats include, 74 tackles, 1 sack, 3 fumbles forced, 5 passes defensed, 5 tackles for loss, 3 interceptions, and 37 interception return yards. In 2007 Williams had 56 tackles. He had 6 tackles in the 2008 Rose Bowl.\nDuring his time with the Trojans, Williams received guidance and feedback from veteran linebackers such as Lofa Tatupu, Matt Grootegoed, Dallas Sartz, Collin Ashton, and Oscar Lua. In order to see more playing time against the more experienced linebackers ahead of him, Williams focused and excelled at special teams play, particularly kickoff coverage. During his redshirt freshman year he was an active member of the 2004 National Championship team, where he played behind Sartz at the strong-side spot. Early in the 2004 season, Williams was nicknamed \"The Hitman\" by coach Pete Carroll for his performance on special teams; the name stuck with him for his career at USC.During the 2005 season, Williams again backed up Sartz, but moved into the starting lineup for six games after Sartz suffered a shoulder injury; he also started twice in the middle and learned the weak-side responsibilities as well. During the 2006 season, when the Trojans fullbacks were decimated by injury, members of the offense such as Ryan Kalil, Sam Baker, and John David Booty, asked him to switch positions to fullback, a position he had played in high school.

After the 2000 season, coach George Welsh retired and was replaced by Al Groh. Schaub was the starter for the first game of the 2001 season at the Wisconsin Badgers. Over the 2001 season, Schaub and Spinner split quarterbacking duties nearly evenly. The two alternated in some games, while in others either Schaub or Spinner received nearly all the snaps. The two quarterback system worked relatively well with both effectively passing the ball to receiver Billy McMullen, the team's leading offensive threat. Schaub finished the season with 1,524 passing yards, 10 touchdowns, and eight interceptions.Spinner transferred to the University of Richmond for the 2002 season, seemingly making Schaub the unquestioned starter. However, Schaub was briefly replaced by redshirt freshman Marques Hagans in the first game of the 2002 season against the Colorado State Rams. Hagans was named the starter for the next game, against the Florida State Seminoles, but was replaced by Schaub who went on to his breakout season.

Peer Gynt is a compensating balance, a complementary color to Brand. In contrast to Brand, with his iron will, Peer is willless, insufficient, and irresolute. Peer \"goes around\" all issues facing him.Brand had a phenomenal literary success, and people became curious to know what Ibsen's next play would be. The dramatist, about this time, was relieved of financial worry by two money grants, one from the Norwegian government and the other from the Scientific Society of Trondhjem. This enabled him to give to his work an unfettered mind. He went with his family to Frascati, where, in the Palazzo rooms, he looked many feet down upon the Mediterranean, and pondered his new drama. He preserved a profound silence about the content of the play, and begged his publisher, Hegel, to create as much mystery about it as possible.\nThe portrayal of the Gynt family is known to be based on Henrik Ibsen's own family and childhood memories; in a letter to Georg Brandes, Ibsen wrote that his own family and childhood had served \"as some kind of model\" for the Gynt family. In a letter to Peter Hansen, Ibsen confirmed that the character \u00c5se, Peer Gynt's mother, was based on his own mother, Marichen Altenburg.  The character Jon Gynt is considered to be based on Ibsen's father Knud Ibsen, who was a rich merchant before he went bankrupt. Even the name of the Gynt family's ancestor, the prosperous Rasmus Gynt, is borrowed from the Ibsen's family's earliest known ancestor. Thus, the character Peer Gynt could be interpreted as being an ironic representation of Henrik Ibsen himself. There are striking similarities to Ibsen's own life; Ibsen himself spent 27 years living abroad and was never able to face his hometown again.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Thomas Nassiff of AbsolutePunk said that PMtoday \"are at their best when they're switching up their sound, going from blistering guitar work to gently woven melodies.\" He also compared them to Circa Survive, Brand New, and also classified them as indie rock. Adam Thomas of Sputnikmusic said that In Medias Res would \"likely end up being one of the best post-hardcore albums to come out in 2010.\"The band also made heavy use of alternating, harmonized and counterpoint vocals, with other band members beside Connor also contributing to vocals.

In their last line-up, this format was expanded to include all four members, although all vocals for In Medias Res were recorded by Connor.\nThe band's second album, In Medias Res, was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Indie Vision Music, who gave the album a positive review, said that \"perseverance is not the word that immediately comes to mind when [he] think[s] of most bands; however, when thinking of pmtoday it certainly fits\" and said that when he \"think[s] of Rise [Records] [he] think[s] of post-hardcore, but [In Medias Res] throws that thinking out the window.\" They closed the review saying that the \"album is a solid Rise debut release and is a must buy for any progressive indie rock fan.\"Phil Freeman, a writer for Alternative Press, gave the album a positive review compared PMtoday to the \"earliest Mars Volta recordings, before Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez decided every flubbed note he recorded deserved its own solo album\" due to their \"funk rock riffing and blistering tempos.\" He closed the review with:\n\nThese guys are outrageously talented--good-to-great lyricists/songwriters and astonishing musicians (the two don't always go hand in hand). They never settle for screaming and distortion when a more thoughtful approach will yield bigger dividends, but they also hardly ever miss an opportunity to shred. They deserve to be huge; this is one of the best albums of 2010 so far, and a mind-roasting debut.\nChris Marshman, a writer for webzine Alter the Press!, gave the album a positive review, stating that the album starts with a \"somewhat dampening opener\", referring to \"Thoughts In Transit\", and comments that a listener \"could be forgiven for thinking that [they]\u2019re not in for a very enjoyable listen.

[...] Despite the differences in the sounds of songs, it all blends together effortlessly and what could have been a hefty gamble for an album has turned into a resounding success.\nJoshua Khan of Ultimate Guitar Archive also gave the album a positive review, stating that \"guitarists Connor and Cuinn Brogan shred their way across the disc's ten tracks, transforming indie rock melodies into post-hardcore breakdowns with a hint of pop. The combination seems unrealistic and fake, but the outcome is almost breathtaking. Numerous bands have swayed from progressive rock set in stone by bands such as Coheed and Cambria, and PMtoday rejuvenate it without undertones that are incredibly dark.\" He also made a note of the track \"Don't Exist\", stating that it \"starts like an indie pop track and turns into a constant battle of melodic riffs. Such unexpected turns are littered throughout the record, along with intense jam sessions reminiscent of [Mars Volta], leaving listeners hanging on to every moment the band conjures a breakdown.\"  He closed the review with:\n\nIt doesn't have a polished force behind it like albums from Coheed And Cambria and Circa Survive, but the sophomore full-length from PMtoday does reek of potential. Instead of blatantly talking about girls and trying to make every line rhyme, the band questions listeners with interesting lyrics and a sound that could seem nostalgic even though it was popular less than five years ago.

Her position was Head of Employee Relations, Organizational Development and Management Training. A stated vision for the company was to be \"the most progressive employer in the United States\". In 1987, Kapor Klein founded the consulting firm Klein Associates to provide training on issues of fairness and bias reduction in work environments.Kapor Klein became a partner at Kapor Capital, which was founded in 1999. The fund, which has made a pledge to only invest in companies that prioritize diversity, focuses on products that \"close gaps of access and opportunity\". An example she gave was the mobile app Pigeonly which aims to bypass the high cost of phone calls in and out of the prison system. Her investment sectors include education, health, and consumer finance. Kapor Capital has been absorbed into the broader organization known as the Kapor Center for Social Impact. Another project under this umbrella is the Level Playing Field Institute, founded by Kapor Klein in 2001. Aiming to foster interest in STEM fields among underrepresented groups, the LPFI promotes computer science participation through hackathons and workshops. Some studies produced by the institute include The Tilted Playing Field and The Corporate Leaders Survey. The institute is also known for its Summer Math and Science Honors Academy (SMASH) three-summer high school program. SMASH has been described as \"100 percent students of color\" and has led most of them to pursue a degree in a quantitative science.Kapor Klein's for-profit and non-profit organizations, which are run from the same office, regularly contribute studies on racial and gender disparity. They have explored factors ranging from direct discrimination to attrition in the STEM pipeline. Two notable studies are an assessment of inclusion efforts at Fortune 500 manufacturing firms and a survey of bias experienced by Massachusetts physicians and medical students. Described as \"in regular touch with the White House\", Kapor Klein has advised the World Bank and the United Nations. She also gave input on the Civil Rights Act of 1991.In 2016, Kapor Klein, along with Erica Baker, bethanye Blount, Tracy Chou, Laura Gomez, Y-Vonne Hutchinson, Ellen Pao, and Susan Wu founded the non-profit organization Project Include to develop customized human resources advice in consultation with startup executives.

Williams career stats include, 74 tackles, 1 sack, 3 fumbles forced, 5 passes defensed, 5 tackles for loss, 3 interceptions, and 37 interception return yards. In 2007 Williams had 56 tackles. He had 6 tackles in the 2008 Rose Bowl.\nDuring his time with the Trojans, Williams received guidance and feedback from veteran linebackers such as Lofa Tatupu, Matt Grootegoed, Dallas Sartz, Collin Ashton, and Oscar Lua. In order to see more playing time against the more experienced linebackers ahead of him, Williams focused and excelled at special teams play, particularly kickoff coverage. During his redshirt freshman year he was an active member of the 2004 National Championship team, where he played behind Sartz at the strong-side spot. Early in the 2004 season, Williams was nicknamed \"The Hitman\" by coach Pete Carroll for his performance on special teams; the name stuck with him for his career at USC.During the 2005 season, Williams again backed up Sartz, but moved into the starting lineup for six games after Sartz suffered a shoulder injury; he also started twice in the middle and learned the weak-side responsibilities as well. During the 2006 season, when the Trojans fullbacks were decimated by injury, members of the offense such as Ryan Kalil, Sam Baker, and John David Booty, asked him to switch positions to fullback, a position he had played in high school. Thus Williams started twice at fullback and played several games that season on both offense and defense. Over the years, Williams played all three linebacker positions. Williams teammates voted him the team's most inspirational player in the 2007 season; he finished the regular season as the third-leading tackler among linebackers with 3\u00bd tackles for losses, an interception and two forced fumbles on a defense that ranked second nationally.Thomas R.

Jeff searches an FBI database to find possible suspects, but is caught by Collins, who once again orders Gracie, Sam, and Joel back to New York. Before leaving the FBI, Gracie sees a ransom video of Cheryl sent by the kidnappers.\nAt the airport, Gracie and Sam fight, revealing what Sam calls \u2018the real Gracie Hart\u2019, rather than the media-friendly image she has become. The two, along with Joel and Jeff, again escape FBI custody and head to the Osiris Drag Club, where the only Dolly Parton impersonator in Las Vegas performs. With Sam impersonating Tina Turner and Gracie and Joel dressed as showgirls, Gracie and Sam perform to 'Proud Mary', earning them access into the club\u2019s dressing room. The Dolly Parton impersonator tells them that Karl Steele, who he worked with at Treasure Island, forced him to make the payment to Cheryl and Stan\u2019s limo driver.\nCollins leads an FBI raid on Lou and Karl\u2019s house, only to discover it deserted. Gracie deduces from coded language Cheryl used in the ransom video that she and Stan have been taken to Treasure Island. Once there, she and Sam fight Lou and Karl. Karl reveals that Cheryl and Stan are tied up inside one of the hotel\u2019s pirate ships, which they plan to sink. Gracie rescues Stan and Cheryl, but becomes trapped underwater when her dress becomes pinned beneath a cannon; Sam arrives to save her. Cheryl and Jeff strike up a romance, and Gracie bumps the fame-hungry Collins into the water after he tries to take credit for the rescue. Gracie leaves her spokesperson position to return to field work, with Sam as her new partner.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Toole looked forward to coming home and spending time talking with his mother. Toole turned down an offer to return to his post at Hunter, and arrived home to a teaching position at Dominican College, a Catholic all-female school. He initially liked the position as it allowed him to teach for only 10.5 hours a week and afforded him the same leisure time he had during his less active periods in the service. The nuns on the faculty were enamored with Toole from the start, considering him well mannered, genteel, and charming. He used his free time to work on his novel, and to spend some time with his musician friend Sidney Snow at Snow's home in the Irish Channel and at various night clubs where he would watch Snow and his bandmates perform, among other things, covers of songs by The Beatles. The November 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy caused Toole to fall into severe depression. He stopped writing and drank heavily. In February 1964 he resumed writing, at which point he added an ending and sent the manuscript to Simon & Schuster.Dunces has been described as a \"grand comic fugue\" and is considered one of the seminal works of twentieth century Southern literature. It has received praise for its accurate use of various New Orleans dialects, including the Yat dialect. It concerns protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly, a slothful, obese, self-styled philosopher who lives with his mother. After an early financial setback for the Reilly family, caused by Ignatius, he is forced by his mother to seek employment in a variety of menial jobs to help the household financially, for which he is continually resentful of her. He subsequently takes revenge on several businesses for perceived slights. He incites black workers to insurrection at Levy Pants Company, eats more hot dogs than he sells, and attempts to break up a strip club. Along the way he runs into a divergent cast of characters, including Myrna Minkoff, a rebellious socialist intellectual with whom he conducts an ongoing literary correspondence. Although Reilly is partially modeled after Toole's eccentric friend Bob Byrne, Byrne and others have stated that much of Reilly is actually based on Toole himself:\nKen Toole was a strange person. He was extroverted and private. And that's very difficult. He had a strong ... desire to be recognized. ... but also a strong sense of alienation. That's what you have in Ignatius Reilly.\nThe book eventually reached senior editor Robert Gottlieb, who had talked the then-unknown Joseph Heller into completing the classic comic novel Catch-22. Gottlieb and Toole began a two-year correspondence and dialogue over the novel which would ultimately result in bitter disappointment on both sides. While Gottlieb felt Toole was undoubtedly talented, he was unhappy with the book in its original form. He felt that it had one basic flaw which he expressed to Toole in an early letter:\nIt seems that you understand the problem\u2014the major problem\u2014involved, but think that the conclusion can solve it. More is required, though. Not only do the various threads need resolving; they can always be tied together conveniently. What must happen is that they must be strong and meaningful all the way through\u2014not merely episodic and then wittily pulled together to make everything look as if it's come out right. In other words, there must be a point to everything you have in the book, a real point, not just amusingness that's forced to figure itself out.\nInitially, although Toole was disappointed that the novel could not be published as is, he was exuberant that a major publisher was interested in it. He entered his second year of teaching at Dominican as one of the favorite new professors on staff. Students marveled at his wit, and Toole would make entire classes burst into laughter while hardly showing any expression. He never retold a story or joke, and had many repeat students. Shortly before Christmas break in 1964, Toole received a letter from Gottlieb. In it Gottlieb remarked that he had shown the novel to Candida Donadio, a literary agent whose clients included Joseph Heller and Thomas Pynchon. Gottlieb told Toole they felt he was \"... wildly funny often, funnier than almost anyone around\". Also they liked the same portions and characters of the book and disliked the same parts as well. Gottlieb gave a list of things he did not like concluding with:\nBut that, all this aside, there is another problem: that with all its wonderfulnesses, the book\u2014even better plotted (and still better plotable)\u2014does not have a reason; it's a brilliant exercise in invention, but unlike CATCH [22] and MOTHER KISSES and V and the others, it isn't really about anything. And that's something no one can do anything about.\nLater on in the letter, Gottlieb stated that he still had faith in Toole as a writer and that he wished to hold onto the manuscript in case he or Toole would be able to see a way around his objections. Toole decided that it would be best for Gottlieb to return the manuscript, saying \"Aside from a few deletions, I don't think I could really do much to the book now\u2014and of course even with revisions you might not be satisfied.\" Toole made a trip to New York to see Gottlieb in person; however, he was out of town and Toole came back disappointed. He felt that he had embarrassed himself by giving a rambling, uncomfortable speech explaining his situation to one of Gottlieb's office staff. He returned home having left a note for Gottlieb to call him, and they later talked for an hour on the phone. In this conversation Gottlieb re-iterated that he would not accept the novel without further revision. He suggested that Toole move on to writing something else, an idea which Toole ultimately rejected.In a long, partially autobiographical letter he sent to Gottlieb in March 1965, Toole explained that he could not give up on the book since he wrote the novel largely from personal observation and because the characters were based on real people he had seen in his life.\nI don't want to throw these characters away. In other words, I'm going to work on the book again.

The clapper is a metal sphere approximately 4 mm (3\u204416 in) in diameter suspended between the piles, which rings the bells alternately due to electrostatic forces. When the clapper touches one bell, it is charged by that pile. It is then repelled from that bell due to having the same charge and attracted to the other bell, which has the opposite charge. The clapper then touches the other bell and the process reverses, leading to oscillation. The use of electrostatic forces means that while high voltage is required to create motion, only a tiny amount of charge is carried from one bell to the other. As a result, the batteries drain very slowly, which is why the piles have been able to last since the apparatus was set up in 1840. Its oscillation frequency is 2 hertz.The exact composition of the dry piles is unknown, but it is known that they have been coated with molten sulfur for insulation and it is thought that they may be Zamboni piles.At one point this sort of device played an important role in distinguishing between two different theories of electrical action: the theory of contact tension (an obsolete scientific theory based on then-prevailing electrostatic principles) and the theory of chemical action.The Oxford Electric Bell does not demonstrate perpetual motion. The bell will eventually stop when the dry piles have distributed their charges equally if the clapper does not wear out first.

But after only a season with the club he was sold to Huddersfield Town following a short loan spell. His time in Yorkshire was a rather mixed one. He alternated between a deep-lying creative midfield role and that of a libero-style sweeper. Described as a flair player with much skill, he scored a wonder goal against Bradford City from just inside his own half in a League Cup tie, which proved to be his only goal for Huddersfield. At the time of his goal, the tie was balanced at 2\u20132 on aggregate. Burnett's goal in the 77th minute put Huddersfield through to the next round.Following a clear out at Huddersfield, Burnett was loaned to Grimsby Town in 1998 and scored in his debut against Scunthorpe United as the Mariners put their local rivals out of the Football League Trophy.It was in the same competition at Wembley Stadium against AFC Bournemouth that Burnett scored the winning golden goal in the 1998 final and played in the promotion winning team in the play-off final a month later. Burnett helped the Mariners to an impressive finish in the Championship, almost securing a play-off spot to the Premiership the following season.\nHe stayed with Grimsby until the summer of 2002, but was troubled by a persistent injury problem that made him miss chunks of the 1999\u20132000, 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302 seasons.

The incident happened in a Conference game in which Woking were trailing 2\u20130 with 20 minutes remaining. Burnett was brought on as a substitute but could not change the outcome of the game. In a statement made to the Grimsby Telegraph, Burnett claimed that Woking supporters had singled him out for abuse, stating that they expected him to come on and win the game for them because he was a professional footballer.

It received praise for the decisions to experiment with dubstep, bubblegum pop and electronic music on some of the tracks and criticism towards the ballads, with critics divided over the number on one album and their quality versus the more up-tempo songs. Ludovic Hunter-Tilney from the Financial Times found that although there was still a \"preponderance of Adele-aping break-up songs\", the delays in releasing Glassheart had worked in Lewis' favour by forcing her to \"confront her lack of [musical] direction\". Hunter-Tilney praised both the Mariah Carey-styled vocals and use of \"echoing snare drums\" in many of the songs, concluding that Lewis' singing \"has an extra edge to it\" while the music \"strays out of her comfort zone\". The Daily Mirror's Dean Piper also noted similarities to Adele, commenting that although both Lewis and Adele had worked with Smith, Lewis' album would \"not translate to a universal audience\" like Adele's 21 had. However Piper did call the comparison unfair because Glassheart \"reminds you what an extraordinary talent Leona is\", also saying \"there's no doubting the music is good and Glassheart does appear to be her most personal album to date.\" Amongst the songs Piper picked out were \"Un Love Me\", \"Favourite Scar\" and \"Fingerprint\". Another positive review came from Digital Spy's Lewis Corner who said that Lewis surprised on \"the pacey numbers full of angst and torment that standout\". Commending her falsetto, Corner awarded Lewis five out of five stars and ended by saying \"Like many artists before her, Leona has channelled the darker side of love's grasp into her work \u2013 and the result is nothing short of spectacular.\"Matthew Horton writing for Virgin Media praised Lewis for experimenting with dubstep on \"Come Alive\" and bubblegum pop on \"Shake You Up\", describing both songs as experiments that work. Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian newspaper picked up on the album's composition and described it as too heavily reliant on ballads, saying the issue was that it was \"an area where Adele now has the advantage.\" However Sullivan did say that \"for once Lewis has made an album that's worth turning up \u2013 in parts, at least.\" She praised \"Come Alive\", \"Glassheart\" and \"Trouble\". Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music gave the album a mixed review saying that Glassheart \"largely plays up to expectations\". He criticised the subject matter, noting that many of the songs revisit familiar territory on how \"she is always unlucky in love, unless she is swooning in melancholy bliss.\" McAlpine praised the production values, noting that \"over the course of these 12 songs there are all sorts of production nods to happier music\" but also pointing out that on most songs \"[Lewis] sounds devastated.\" In part \"it's her natural tone of voice\", McAlpine concluded, as well as noting that there were not really any up-tempo songs, just songs that were not ballads, but adding that it did not matter as \"the songs that tend to fly best, on their own terms at least, are the uncluttered muscle ballads.\" Commenting on \"Come Alive\", he stated that although the \"breakbeat\" production is one of the \"happier\" ones on the album, Lewis sounds \"eternally downcast\". The Independent's Hugh Montgomery gave the album a mixed review, saying that \"obviously there's still swathes of antiseptic balladry best described as 'music to fold towels by'.\" However, not all of his review was negative. Montgomery said the album attempted to make Lewis \"current again\" by including songs penned by Sand\u00e9, a \"Bond theme manqu\u00e9\" and \"obviously and actually rather effectively, some dubstep\". Critics Robert Copsey and Lewis Corner from Digital Spy put Glassheart at number nine in their top 20 albums of 2012, writing that despite being renowned for ballads, \"it's the pacey numbers full of angst and torment that stand out.\" Later in a poll of 25,000 people, conducted by Digital Spy, readers voted Glassheart the fifth best album of 2012 with 9.8% share of the vote, behind Sand\u00e9's Our Version of Events, Babel by Mumford and Sons, Lana Del Rey's Born to Die and Fall to Grace by Paloma Faith.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although Henslowe does not specify a theatre, it was most likely The Rose. Repeated performances were staged on 28 January and 6 February. On 5 and 12 June, Henslowe recorded two further performances of the play, at the Newington Butts Theatre by the combined Admiral's Men and Lord Chamberlain's Men. The 24 January show earned three pounds eight shillings, and the performances on 29 January and 6 February earned two pounds each, making it the most profitable play of the season. The next recorded performance was on 1 January 1596, when a troupe of London actors, possibly Chamberlain's Men, performed the play during the Christmas festivities at Burley-on-the-Hill in the manor of Sir John Harington, Baron of Exton.Some scholars, however, have suggested that the January 1594 performance may not be the first recorded performance of the play. On 11 April 1592, Henslowe recorded ten performances by Derby's Men of a play called Titus and Vespasian, which some, such as E. K. Chambers, have identified with Shakespeare's play. Most scholars, however, believe that Titus and Vespasian is more likely a different play about the two real life Roman Emperors, Vespasian, who ruled from 69 to 79, and his son Titus, who ruled from 79 to 81. The two were subjects of many narratives at the time, and a play about them would not have been unusual. Dover Wilson further argues that the theory that Titus and Vespasian is Titus Andronicus probably originated in an 1865 English translation of a 1620 German translation of Titus, in which Lucius had been renamed Vespasian.\nAlthough it is known that the play was definitely popular in its day, there is no other recorded performance for many years. In January 1668, it was listed by the Lord Chamberlain as one of twenty-one plays owned by the King's Company which had, at some stage previously, been acted at Blackfriars Theatre; \"A Catalogue of part of his Mates Servants Playes as they were formally acted at the Blackfryers & now allowed of to his Mates Servants at ye New Theatre.\" However, no other information is provided. During the late seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, adaptations of the play came to dominate the stage, and after the Burley performance in 1596 and the possible Blackfriars performance some time prior to 1667, there is no definite recorded performance of the Shakespearean text in England until the early twentieth century.\nAfter over 300 years absence from the English stage, the play returned on 8 October 1923, in a production directed by Robert Atkins at The Old Vic, as part of the Vic's presentation of the complete dramatic works over a seven-year period. The production featured Wilfred Walter as Titus, Florence Saunders as Tamora, George Hayes as Aaron and Jane Bacon as Lavinia. Reviews at the time praised Hayes' performance but criticised Walter's as monotonous. Atkins staged the play with a strong sense of Elizabethan theatrical authenticity, with a plain black backdrop, and a minimum of props. Critically, the production met with mixed reviews, some welcoming the return of the original play to the stage, some questioning why Atkins had bothered when various adaptations were much better and still extant. Nevertheless, the play was a huge box office success, one of the most successful in the Complete Works presentation.The earliest known performance of the Shakespearean text in the United States was in April 1924 when the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity of Yale University staged the play under the direction of John M. Berdan and E. M. Woolley as part of a double bill with Robert Greene's Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay. While some material was removed from 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, the rest of the play was left intact, with much attention devoted to the violence and gore. The cast list for this production has been lost.The best known and most successful production of the play in England was directed by Peter Brook for the RSC at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1955, starring Laurence Olivier as Titus, Maxine Audley as Tamora, Anthony Quayle as Aaron and Vivien Leigh as Lavinia. Brook had been offered the chance to direct Macbeth but had controversially turned it down, and instead decided to stage Titus. The media predicted that the production would be a massive failure, and possibly spell the end of Brook's career, but on the contrary, it was a huge commercial and critical success, with many of the reviews arguing that Brook's alterations improved Shakespeare's script (Marcus' lengthy speech upon discovering Lavinia was removed and some of the scenes in Act 4 were reorganised). Olivier in particular was singled out for his performance and for making Titus a truly sympathetic character. J. C. Trewin for example, wrote \"the actor had thought himself into the hell of Titus; we forgot the inadequacy of the words in the spell of the projection.\" The production is also noted for muting the violence: Chiron and Demetrius were killed off stage; the heads of Quintus and Martius were never seen; the nurse is strangled, not stabbed; Titus' hand was never seen; blood and wounds were symbolised by red ribbons. Edward Trostle Jones summed up the style of the production as employing \"stylised distancing effects\". The scene where Lavinia first appears after the rape was singled out by critics as being especially horrific, with her wounds portrayed by red streamers hanging from her wrists and mouth. Some reviewers however, found the production too beautified, making it unrealistic, with several commenting on the cleanness of Lavinia's face after her tongue has supposedly been cut out. After its hugely successful Royal Shakespeare Theatre run, the play went on tour around Europe in 1957. No video recordings of the production are known, although there are many photographs available.The success of the Brook production seems to have provided an impetus for directors to tackle the play, and ever since 1955, there has been a steady stream of performances on the English and American stages. After Brook, the next major production came in 1967, when Douglas Seale directed an extremely graphic and realistic presentation at the Centre Stage in Baltimore with costumes that recalled the various combatants in World War II. Seale's production employed a strong sense of theatrical realism to make parallels between the contemporary period and that of Titus, and thus comment on the universality of violence and revenge. Seale set the play in the 1940s and made pointed parallels with concentration camps, the massacre at Katyn, the Nuremberg Rallies and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Saturninus was based on Benito Mussolini and all his followers dressed entirely in black; Titus was modelled after a Prussian Army officer; the Andronici wore Nazi insignia and the Goths at the end of the play were dressed in Allied Forces uniforms; the murders in the last scene are all carried out by gunfire, and at the end of the play swastikas rained down onto the stage. The play received mixed reviews with many critics wondering why Seale had chosen to associate the Andronici with Nazism, arguing that it created a mixed metaphor.Later in 1967, as a direct reaction to Seale's realistic production, Gerald Freedman directed a performance for Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Festival at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, Manhattan, starring Jack Hollander as Titus, Olympia Dukakis as Tamora, Moses Gunn as Aaron and Erin Martin as Lavinia. Freedman had seen Seale's production and felt it failed because it worked by \"bringing into play our sense of reality in terms of detail and literal time structure\". He argued that when presented realistically, the play simply does not work, as it raises too many practical questions, such as why does Lavinia not bleed to death, why does Marcus not take her to the hospital immediately, why does Tamora not notice that the pie tastes unusual, exactly how do both Martius and Quintus manage to fall into a hole? Freedman argued that \"if one wants to create a fresh emotional response to the violence, blood and multiple mutilations of Titus Andronicus, one must shock the imagination and subconscious with visual images that recall the richness and depth of primitive rituals.\" As such, the costumes were purposely designed to represent no particular time or place but were instead based on those of the Byzantine Empire and feudal Japan. Additionally, the violence was stylised; instead of swords and daggers, wands were used and no contact was ever made. The colour scheme was hallucinatory, changing mid-scene. Characters wore classic masks of comedy and tragedy. The slaughter in the final scene was accomplished symbolically by having each character wrapped in a red robe as they died. A narrator (Charles Dance) was also used, who, prior to each act, would announce what was going to happen in the upcoming act, thus undercutting any sense of realism. The production received generally positive reviews, with Mildred Kuner arguing \"Symbolism rather than gory realism was what made this production so stunning.\"In 1972, Trevor Nunn directed an RSC production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, as part of a presentation of the four Roman plays, starring Colin Blakely as Titus, Margaret Tyzack as Tamora, Calvin Lockhart as Aaron and Janet Suzman as Lavinia. Colin Blakely and John Wood as a vicious and maniacal Saturninus received particularly positive reviews. This production took the realistic approach and did not shirk from the more specific aspects of the violence; for example, Lavinia has trouble walking after the rape, which, it is implied, was anal rape. Nunn believed the play asked profound questions about the sustainability of Elizabethan society, and as such, he linked the play to the contemporary period to ask the same questions of late twentieth-century England; he was \"less concerned with the condition of ancient Rome than with the morality of contemporary life\". In his program notes, Nunn wrote \"Shakespeare's Elizabethan nightmare has become ours.\" He was especially interested in the theory that decadence had led to the collapse of Rome. At the end of 4.2, for example, there was an on-stage orgy, and throughout the play, supporting actors appeared in the backgrounds dancing, eating, drinking and behaving outrageously. Also in this vein, the play opened with a group of people paying homage to a waxwork of an obese emperor reclining on a couch and clutching a bunch of grapes.The play was performed for the first time at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada in 1978, when it was directed by Brian Bedford, starring William Hutt as Titus, Jennifer Phipps as Tamora, Alan Scarfe as Aaron and Domini Blithe as Lavinia. Bedford went with neither stylisation nor realism; instead the violence simply tended to happen off-stage, but everything else was realistically presented. The play received mixed reviews with some praising its restraint and others arguing that the suppression of the violence went too far. Many cited the final scene, where despite three onstage stabbings, not one drop of blood was visible, and the reveal of Lavinia, where she was totally bloodless despite her mutilation. This production cut Lucius' final speech and instead ended with Aaron alone on the stage as Sibyl predicts the fall of Rome in lines written by Bedford himself. As such, \"for affirmation and healing under Lucius the production substituted a sceptical modern theme of evil triumphant and Rome's decadence.\"A celebrated, and unedited production, (according to Jonathan Bate, not a single line from Q1 was cut) was directed by Deborah Warner in 1987 at The Swan and remounted at Barbican's Pit in 1988 for the RSC, starring Brian Cox as Titus, Estelle Kohler as Tamora, Peter Polycarpou as Aaron and Sonia Ritter as Lavinia. Met with almost universally positive reviews, Jonathan Bate regards it as the finest production of any Shakespearean play of the entire 1980s. Using a small cast, Warner had her actors address the audience from time to time throughout the play and often had actors leave the stage and wander out into the auditorium. Opting for a realist presentation, the play had a warning posted in the pit \"This play contains scenes which some people may find disturbing\", and numerous critics noted how, after the interval at many shows, empty seats had appeared in the audience. Warner's production was considered so successful, both critically and commercially, that the RSC did not stage the play again until 2003.In 1988, Mark Rucker directed a realistic production at Shakespeare Santa Cruz, starring J. Kenneth Campbell as Titus, Molly Maycock as Tamora, Elizabeth Atkeson as Lavinia, and an especially well-received performance by Bruce A. Young as Aaron. Campbell presented Titus in a much more sympathetic light than usual; for example, he kills Mutius by accident, pushing him so that he falls against a tree, and his refusal to allow Mutius to be buried was performed as if in a dream state. Prior to the production, Rucker had Young work out and get in shape so that by the time of the performance, he weighed 240 lbs. Standing at six-foot four, his Aaron was purposely designed to be the most physically imposing character on the stage. Additionally, he was often positioned as standing on hills and tables, with the rest of the cast below him. When he appears with the Goths, he is not their prisoner, but willingly enters their camp in pursuit of his baby, the implication being that without this one weakness, he would have been invincible.In 1994, Julie Taymor directed the play at the Theater for the New City. The production featured a prologue and epilogue set in the modern era, foregrounded the character of Young Lucius, who acts as a kind of choric observer of events, and starred Robert Stattel as Titus, Melinda Mullins as Tamora, Harry Lennix as Aaron and Miriam Healy-Louie as Lavinia. Heavily inspired in her design by Joel-Peter Witkin, Taymor used stone columns to represent the people of Rome, who she saw as silent and incapable of expressing any individuality or subjectivity. Controversially, the play ended with the implication that Lucius had killed Aaron's baby, despite his vow not to.\nIn 1995, Gregory Doran directed a production at the Royal National Theatre, which also played at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg, South Africa, starring Antony Sher as Titus, Dorothy Ann Gould as Tamora, Sello Maake as Aaron and Jennifer Woodbine as Lavinia. Although Doran explicitly denied any political overtones, the play was set in a modern African context and made explicit parallels to South African politics. In his production notes, which Doran co-wrote with Sher, he stated, \"Surely, to be relevant, theatre must have an umbilical connection to the lives of the people watching it.\" One particularly controversial decision was to have the play spoken in indigenous accents rather than Received Pronunciation, which allegedly resulted in many white South Africans refusing to see the play. Writing in Plays International in August 1995, Robert Lloyd Parry argued \"the questions raised by Titus went far beyond the play itself [to] many of the tensions that exist in the new South Africa; the gulf of mistrust that still exists between blacks and whites ... Titus Andronicus has proved itself to be political theatre in the truest sense.\"For the first time since 1987, the RSC staged the play in 2003, under the direction of Bill Alexander and starring David Bradley as Titus, Maureen Beattie as Tamora, Joe Dixon as Aron and Eve Myles as Lavinia. Convinced that Act 1 was by George Peele, Alexander felt he was not undermining the integrity of Shakespeare by drastically altering it; for example, Saturninus and Tamora are present throughout, they never leave the stage; there is no division between the upper and lower levels; all mention of Mutius is absent; and over 100 lines were removed.\nIn 2006, two major productions were staged within a few weeks of one another. The first opened on 29 May at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by Lucy Bailey and starring Douglas Hodge as Titus, Geraldine Alexander as Tamora, Shaun Parkes as Aaron and Laura Rees as Lavinia. Bailey focused on a realistic presentation throughout the production; for example, after her mutilation, Lavinia is covered from head to toe in blood, with her stumps crudely bandaged, and raw flesh visible beneath. So graphic was Bailey's use of realism that at several productions, audience members fainted upon Lavinia's appearance. The production was also controversial insofar as the Globe had a roof installed for the first time in its history. The decision was taken by designer William Dudley, who took as his inspiration a feature of the Colosseum known as a velarium \u2013 a cooling system which consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the centre. Dudley made it as a PVC awning which was intended to darken the auditorium.\nThe second 2006 production opened at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre on 9 June as part of the Complete Works Festival. Directed by Yukio Ninagawa, it starred Kotaro Yoshida as Titus, Rei Asami as Tamora, Shun Oguri as Aaron and Hitomi Manaka as Lavinia. Performed in Japanese, the original English text was projected as surtitles onto the back of the stage. In stark contrast to Bailey's production, theatricality was emphasised; the play begins with the company still rehearsing and getting into costume and the stage hands still putting the sets together. The production followed the 1955 Brook production in its depiction of violence; actress Hitomi Manaka appeared after the rape scene with stylised red ribbons coming from her mouth and arms, substituting for blood. Throughout the play, at the back of the stage, a huge marble wolf can be seen from which feed Romulus and Remus, with the implication being that Rome is a society based on animalistic origins. The play ends with Young Lucius holding Aaron's baby out to the audience and crying out \"The horror! The horror!\"Several reviews of the time made much of the manner in which each production approached the appearance of Lavinia after the rape: \"At Shakespeare's Globe, the groundlings are fainting at the mutilations in Lucy Bailey's coarse but convincing production. To Stratford-upon-Avon, Yukio Ninagawa brings a Japanese staging so stylised that it keeps turning the horror into visual poetry.\" Speaking of Bailey's production, Eleanor Collins of Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, said of the scene, \"audience members turned their heads away in real distress\". Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph called Lavinia \"almost too ghastly to behold\". Michael Billington of The Guardian said her slow shuffle onto the stage \"chills the blood\". Sam Marlowe of The Times saw Bailey's use of realism as extremely important for the moral of the production as a whole: \"violated, her hands and her tongue cruelly cut away, she stumbles into view drenched in blood, flesh dangling from her hacked wrists, moaning and keening, almost animalistic. It's the production's most powerful symbolic image, redolent of the dehumanising effects of war.\" Of Ninagawa's production, some critics felt the use of stylisation damaged the impact of the scene. Benedict Nightingale of The Times, for example, asked \"is it enough to suggest bloodletting by having red ribbons flow from wrists and throats?\" Similarly, The Guardian's Michael Billington, who had praised Bailey's use of realistic effects, wrote \"At times I felt that Ninagawa, through stylised images and Handelian music, unduly aestheticised violence.\" Some critics, however, felt the stylisation was more powerful than Bailey's realism; Neil Allan and Scott Revers of Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, for example, wrote \"Blood itself was denoted by spools of red thread spilling from garments, limbs and Lavinia's mouth. Cruelty was stylised; the visceral became the aesthetic.\" Similarly, Paul Taylor, writing for The Independent, wrote \"Gore is represented by swatches of red cords that tumble and trail from wounded wrists and mouths. You might think that this method had a cushioning effect. In fact it concentrates and heightens the horror.\" Ninagawa himself said \"The violence is all there. I am just trying to express these things in a different way from any previous production.\" In her 2013 essay, \"Mythological Reconfigurations on the Contemporary Stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus\", which directly compares the depictions of the two Lavinias, Agn\u00e8s Lafont writes of Ninagawa's production that Lavinia's appearance functions as a \"visual emblem\": \"Bloodshed and beauty create a stark dissonance ... Distancing itself from the violence it stages thanks to 'dissonance', the production presents Lavinia onstage as if she were a painting ... Ninagawa's work distances itself from cruelty, as the spectacle of suffering is stylised. Ribbons that represent blood ... are symbolic means of filtering the aching spectacle of an abused daughter, and yet the spectacle retains its shocking potential and its power of empathy all the while intellectualizing it.\"In 2007, Gale Edwards directed a production for the Shakespeare Theatre Company at the Harman Center for the Arts, starring Sam Tsoutsouvas as Titus, Valerie Leonard as Tamora, Colleen Delany as Lavinia, and Peter Macon as Aaron. Set in an unspecific modern milieu, props were kept to a minimum, with lighting and general staging kept simple, as Edwards wanted the audience to concentrate on the story, not the staging. The production received generally very favourable reviews.In 2011, Michael Sexton directed a modern military dress production at The Public Theater on a minimalistic set made of plywood boards. The production had a low budget and much of it was spent on huge volumes of blood that literally drenched the actors in the final scene, as Sexton said he was determined to outdo his contemporaries in terms of the amount of on-stage blood in the play. The production starred Jay O. Sanders (who was nominated for a Lucille Lortel) as Titus, Stephanie Roth Haberle as Tamora, Ron Cephas Jones as Aaron and Jennifer Ikeda as Lavinia.In 2013, Michael Fentiman directed the play for the Royal Shakespeare Company, with Stephen Boxer as Titus, Katy Stephens as Tamora, Kevin Harvey as Aaron, and Rose Reynolds as Lavinia. Emphasising the gore and violence, the production carried a trailer with warnings of \"graphic imagery and scenes of butchery\". It played at The Swan until October 2013. Also in 2013, the Hudson Shakespeare Company staged a production directed by Jon Ciccarelli as part of a special Halloween festival for the Historic Jersey City and Harsimus Cemetery. The production contrasted a military and modern Goth culture, but quickly disintegrated into an anarchic state, stressing the black comedy of the play.Outside Britain and the United States, other significant productions include Qiping Xu's 1986 production in China, which drew political parallels to Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards; Peter Stein's 1989 production in Italy which evoked images of twentieth century Fascism; Daniel Mesguich's 1989 production in Paris, which set the entire play in a crumbling library, acting as a symbol for Roman civilisation; Nenni Delmestre's 1992 production in Zagreb which acted as a metaphor for the struggles of the Croatian people; and Silviu Purc\u0103rete's 1992 Romanian production, which explicitly avoided using the play as a metaphor for the fall of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu (this production is one of the most successful plays ever staged in Romania, and it was revived every year up to 1997).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jennings Trophy in a row from 1986 to 1989. As a result, Racicot's first season was spent largely on the Sherbrooke Canadiens farm team, but he finally made his NHL debut on December 9, 1989, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, when he allowed three goals on six shots in just less than 13 minutes before being replaced. It was his only NHL appearance of the 1989\u201390 NHL season. He shared the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Award for fewest goals allowed in the AHL in 1990 with fellow understudy Jean-Claude Bergeron.\nThe 1990\u201391 season saw regular understudy Hayward's traded to the Minnesota North Stars.

In his 9 appearances for Montreal he was winless, while Roy appeared in 67 games to earn another Jennings Trophy.\nIn 1992\u201393 Racicot had his most successful season for Montreal. While Roy appeared in the majority of games (62 of the 84 possible) Racicot saw action in 26 games, winning 17. The Canadiens made their way to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals. Racicot saw only 18 minutes of action in the playoffs as Roy backstopped the unfancied Montreal to their first Stanley Cup win since 1986.\nThe following year Racicot again faced competition for his second string position, with Ron Tugnutt and Les Kuntar splitting playing time. His performances dipped, and ultimately he was released at the end of the 1994 season.\nRacicot left the NHL after the 1994 season, spending several seasons with various teams in the AHL, International Hockey League, and East Coast Hockey League.

Garcia and Kahn met in 1970 playing together at Monday jam sessions hosted by Howard Wales at the small San Francisco club, the Matrix.\nOver the years, the lineup of the Jerry Garcia Band changed many times. The one constant member besides Garcia himself was bassist John Kahn, who served as Garcia's principal musical collaborator outside of the Grateful Dead after 1970. Melvin Seals had the next longest tenure, serving as keyboardist from 1981 onward.\nJerry Garcia's musical interests were famously varied, and this was reflected in the diverse music played by his band. Like the Grateful Dead, the Jerry Garcia Band played rock music that was influenced by blues, folk, country, and jazz in an improvisatory milieu that largely served as a framework for Garcia's solos. However, the group eschewed the former band's avant-garde and world music influences in favor of a slower, groove-based \"bar band\" approach strongly oriented toward rhythm and blues (the band often featured female backing vocalists characteristic of the genre), gospel music and reggae. Rock versions of contemporary Americana were also prominent. The relatively languorous tempos were dictated by Garcia and Kahn, much to the chagrin of longtime drummer David Kemper: \"[I]t bothered me from the very beginning. I\u2019d say, \u2018You know we need some uptempo material, it\u2019s just putting me to sleep; the band is putting me to sleep.\u2019 At first I\u2019d say these things, and then I just decided to go with it. It is what it is, and who was I to say anything? This band preceded me; the whole concept of the band preceded me.\"Staples of the band's repertoire included Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland's \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\" (widely perceived as the group's signature song and their most-performed song), Peter Rowan's \"Midnight Moonlight,\" Jimmy Cliff's \"The Harder They Come\" and \"Sitting in Limbo,\" the Sensational Nightingales' \"My Sisters and Brothers,\" Hank Ballard's \"Tore Up Over You,\" Bob McDill and Allen Reynolds' \"Catfish John,\" John Lennon's \"Dear Prudence,\" Jesse Stone's \"Don't Let Go,\" Allen Toussaint's \"I'll Take a Melody\" and \"Get Out of My Life, Woman\", Little Milton's \"That's What Love Will Make You Do,\" Chuck Berry's \"Let It Rock\" and \"You Never Can Tell,\" Bruce Cockburn's \"Waiting for a Miracle,\" Irving Berlin's \"Russian Lullaby,\" Smokey Robinson's \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\" and \"I Second That Emotion,\" Peter Tosh's \"Stop That Train,\" Bob Marley's \"Stir It Up,\" Robbie Robertson's \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\" the Manhattans' \"Shining Star,\" Van Morrison's \"And It Stoned Me\" and \"Bright Side of the Road\" and Norton Buffalo's \"Ain't No Bread in the Breadbox.\" The band also performed Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's \"Ol' Man River\" and Miles Davis' \"So What\" on one occasion apiece. As with the Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia regularly covered many songs by Bob Dylan with the group, including \"Tangled Up in Blue,\" \"Simple Twist of Fate,\" \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" \"Forever Young,\" \"Se\u00f1or (Tales of Yankee Power),\" \"Tears of Rage,\" \"I Shall Be Released,\" \"Tough Mama\" and \"When I Paint My Masterpiece.\"\nThe group did not perform between November 1978 and October 1979; during that year, Garcia, Kahn and keyboardist Merl Saunders (who performed with Garcia and Kahn from 1971 to 1975 in the Saunders/Garcia Band and Legion of Mary) briefly performed in Reconstruction, a more egalitarian jazz-funk ensemble.\nAccording to Linda Kahn in a 2017 Reddit Ask Me Anything prompt, much of the band's repertoire was curated by her husband: \"[H]e did bring most of the cover material to the table. He has a big record collection and they're all in really good shape, he was pretty anal about his records. I think as far as picking songs, he listened to records all the time, so it depends on whoever was in the band and whatever group was playing at the time and that influenced John a lot.\"Although the repertoire was strongly tilted toward covers, several Garcia-Robert Hunter originals (including \"Run for the Roses,\" \"Mission in the Rain,\" \"Gomorrah,\" \"Cats Under the Stars\" and \"Reuben and Cherise\") were performed exclusively or near-exclusively by the Jerry Garcia Band. Some of the band's original repertoire (most notably \"Deal,\" \"They Love Each Other,\" \"Sugaree,\" and \"Friend of the Devil\") was shared with the Grateful Dead.\nDuring Garcia's lifetime, the Jerry Garcia Band released one studio album, Cats Under the Stars, and one live album, Jerry Garcia Band. A number of additional live albums were released posthumously.\nThe group was an indirect beneficiary of the commercial success of the Grateful Dead's  In the Dark (1987); as the latter group transitioned to summer stadium tours and multi-night arena engagements during their autumn and spring tours, the tour itineraries of the Garcia Band (hitherto confined to clubs and small theaters) came to encompass arenas (primarily in Garcia's key northeastern United States market) and outdoor amphitheaters favored by the Grateful Dead in the early 1980s. During this period, the group continued to play as many as fifteen concerts a year in an informal residency at The Warfield, a 2,300-capacity theater in San Francisco. Clarence Clemons also guested with them on tour for a brief time in 1989 and 1990.Kahn briefly led the group (rechristened JGB) following Garcia's death in 1995. Seals became the bandleader after Kahn's death in 1996; as of 2017, he is the only remaining member from the final iteration of the Jerry Garcia Band in JGB.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She said the miniseries has \"a Masterpiece Theatre gravity and takes a more somber, detailed and sepia-tinted look at the dawn of American democracy.

Other candidates the band considered were Flood and Brian Eno, however they could not fit the band into their schedules. Buller had in fact welcomed a parting of the ways due to the fractious relationship between the band members during the recording of the last album. However, in friendly discussions with Anderson, Buller found that his ideas about a possible new Suede direction tallied almost exactly with the band's own: to write less complex, more immediate songs; to use heavier drum sounds, play fewer guitar solos and only employ string sections on a couple of songs such as \"She\" and \"The Chemistry Between Us.\" The album was recorded between December 1995 and June 1996 at various locations. To prepare for its recording, the band had immersed themselves in T. Rex's 1972 album The Slider and its successor, Tanx; as Buller stated that his aspiration was to make \"The Slider for the Nineties.\" T. Rex became the blueprint of the recording process, as the band spent a month at The Town House just working on drums.Buller explained how the recording process worked: \"Basically, what we did, is that every track started with acoustic guitar, bongos, tambourine and Brett [Anderson], so it all started life pretty much the same way that Marc Bolan recorded all of his stuff originally.\" Bass player Mat Osman recalls how Buller was keen on making the album simple. \"He was really keen on using all those devices: the big repeated end, the handclaps, the straightforward chorus, make it big and obvious.\" In an interview on the eve of the album's release, Anderson stated: \"I wanted it to be a complete turnover from the last album, which was very dark and dank ... I wanted it to be communicative and understandable.\" Two songs which made it onto Coming Up had already been written in the early days of Suede. \"Lazy\" and \"By the Sea\" were two of Anderson's own compositions. \"By the Sea\" was actually written when Suede were recording their first album, which is why the song's opening line is similar to \"So Young\". Unlike the tense and chaotic recording of Dog Man Star, which according to Anderson was mostly written \"by post\", in a shift-like format, the new material was far more celebratory in both its development and execution.As opposed to the previous album which followed a stringent pattern of Butler composing music for Anderson's lyrics, Coming Up was a more collaborative project. Anderson stated: \"Coming Up was more of a meritocracy \u2013 if something was good enough, it didn't matter what the source was.\" Songs such as \"By the Sea\" and \"She\" required the use of keyboards. Faced with the problem as to how to play them live, Suede recruited Simon Gilbert's cousin Neil Codling, who made his debut at a fan-club gig in January 1996. Buller has stated that the reason why the album has a much better sound than the previous albums is that he had minimal involvement in the mixing process, mixing only two songs. Buller credits much of the album's success to Dave Bascombe, who mixed the majority of the songs. According to Buller, having an outside observer mix the record with \"fresh ears\" enhances the overall production quality. Bascombe's input on \"Trash\" was crucial, as it was his idea to speed up the vocals. One of Suede's popular B-sides \"Young Men\" was left off the album, as Buller felt it was \"too dark\" and not as \"poppy [and] in your face\" as other songs on the record.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Additionally, he also worked with his Angels' partner Dick Enberg on Los Angeles Rams football broadcasts from 1973 to 1976. Drysdale kept the fans' interest with stories of his playing days.While at ABC Sports, Drysdale not only did baseball telecasts, but also regional college football games as well as Superstars and Wide World of Sports. After the 1979 World Series, Drysdale covered the World Series Trophy presentation ceremonies for ABC. On October 11, 1980, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma\u2013Texas college football game for ABC in the afternoon, then flew to Houston to call Game 4 of the NLCS between the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies. In the meantime, Drysdale filled in for Jackson on play-by-play for the early innings.\nIn 1984, Drysdale called play-by-play (alongside Reggie Jackson and Earl Weaver) for the National League Championship Series between the San Diego Padres and Chicago Cubs. On October 6, 1984, at San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium, Game 4 of the NLCS ended when Padres first baseman Steve Garvey hit a now-iconic walk-off home run off Cubs relief pitcher Lee Smith, forcing a decisive Game 5. Drysdale on the call:\n\nDeep right field, way back. Cotto going back to the wall... It's gone! Home run Garvey! And there will be tomorrow!\nIn his last ABC assignment, Drysdale interviewed the winners in the Boston Red Sox clubhouse following Game 7 of the 1986 American League Championship Series against the California Angels.In 1985, for the Chicago White Sox, Drysdale broadcast Tom Seaver's 300th victory, against the host New York Yankees in 1985. His post-game interview with Seaver was carried live by both the Sox' network and the Yankees' longtime flagship television station WPIX.On September 28, 1988, fellow Dodger Orel Hershiser surpassed Drysdale when Hershiser finished the season with a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings pitched. In his final start of the year, Hershiser needed to pitch 10 shutout innings to set the mark \u2013 meaning not only that he would have to prevent the San Diego Padres from scoring, but that his own team would also need to fail to score in order to ensure extra innings; against all odds, Hershiser pitched 10 innings of a scoreless tie, with the Padres eventually prevailing 2\u20131 in 16 innings, breaking Drysdale's record. Afterwards, Drysdale came onto the field to congratulate him, remarking, \"Oh, I'll tell ya, congratulations... And at least you kept it in the family.\"Drysdale also called Kirk Gibson's famous walk-off home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series for the Dodgers Radio Network:\n\nGibson a deep sigh, re-gripping the bat, shoulders just shrugged, now goes to the top of the helmet as he always does, steps in with that left foot.

{"id": "413_626", "question": "What position does Allan Shields play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27223", "text": "The Indian Princess is one example of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American national identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation's history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.Barker also had commercial interests, and was motivated by a drive for artistic and financial success. In this vein, the play was an attempt to please the anglophile public, but create something truly American in setting and theme. The portrayals of the Indians in the play, from a perspective of racial sensitivity, have been met with mixed reviews by modern critics.  Some write positively about the portrayals, saying that, other than Grimosco and Miami, the natives are noble, though primitive, and have a more \"American\" value system than the savages traditionally portrayed in British media of the period. Others, however, see the characters portrayed stereotypically as lusty, childlike, weak and corruptible beings, with the exceptions of Pocahontas and Nantaquas, who are portrayed positively only because they accept English values.  Still others take a middle ground, noting the range of representations.  In any case, the play can be seen as a justification of White assimilation of the natives, especially when examining Pocahontas's choice to be with Rolfe as a microcosm of their societies.Critics have pointed out several inherent flaws in the script, including the early placement of the play's climax (Smith at the chopping block) at the beginning of Act II, loose construction,  song lyrics that trivialize characters, and a main character in Pocahontas that is somewhat stilted and overly poetic.  In contrast, however others have argued that Pocahontas's love scene in Act III is where the truest poetry of the piece emerges.There has been less critique of Bray's musical work, but Victor Fell Yellin tried to recreate what he felt was the score's melodic expressiveness and sonorous grandeur in his 1978 recording of it. In the liner notes, he points out that the music does not critically compare with the great musical masters of its time, but its success is derived from its charm. While it lacks modulation, it contains well-turned melodic and rhythmic phrases, and syncopations that add to its American style.The Indian Princess certainly began a long American tradition of romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, who was only a child in Smith's original accounts. Therefore, it deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre, but it can be criticized for diminishing the potential richness of the subject matter.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Still, McCants' strength and 4.51 second time in the 40-yard dash guaranteed he would still be a high pick, if not #1. After being drafted fourth overall by the Buccaneers in 1990, McCants signed a 5-year, $7.4 million deal with the team, including a then-record $2.5 million cash signing bonus.  A highly touted prospect, McCants rookie card by Score quoted former Kentucky head coach Jerry Claiborne as saying \"Keith is one of the best football players I have ever seen.  Have you ever seen a linebacker as big as he is? I never have.  He looks like an elephant and he runs like a deer\". Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins said that \"He plays like he is never out of the play. That is an intensity level I like\".Floyd Peters was brought to the Bucs in 1991, and converted McCants from a linebacker to defensive end. Although McCants resisted the change, Peters convinced him that with time he could become a success story along the lines of Chris Doleman, another Peters conversion. Although privately unhappy he accepted the position, and tried to make the best of it, claiming \"Teams won't take me lightly. I can tell you that...I can play any position on this football team, except maybe quarterback. When this season is over, I could be in the Pro Bowl. You don't know how hungry I am. It doesn't matter what position I'm playing. What matters is me.\"Although McCants was not fond of the move, he did have some success, as he led the Buccaneers in 1991 with 34 quarterback pressures and recorded 5 sacks, prompting Patrick Zier of the New York Times to remark \"considering the circumstances, McCants first year was a success. . .despite having to learn an entirely new position\". In December 1991, Coach Peters told the media \"I think he's played a decent season.  If you watch films, Keith is a producer.\"  McCants continued to build upon his experience and was second on the Buccaneers in sacks (5) and quarterback pressures (21) in 1992. Eventually, Tampa Bay cut him during their 1993 training camp.\nWithin 48 hours, he was picked up off waivers by the New England Patriots, where he was reunited once again with Ray Perkins, then New England's Offensive coordinator.  Regarding his cut from the Bucs and resigning, McCants remarked at the time \"This is a lot off my shoulders...The rumors had been spreading for some time now concerning my future with Tampa.\" He played in a preseason game the day he was signed, against the Kansas City Chiefs, before being released.\nIn 1993 while with the Houston Oilers, McCants stepped in to separate Buddy Ryan and Kevin Gilbride when Ryan punched Gilbride in the face following an Oilers fumble.  That season, the Oilers would go on to finish first in the AFC Central Division, sending them to their seventh straight postseason, and McCants's first.  When asked what it meant to go to the playoffs, McCants replied, \"Let me tell you something, this is big-time. This is football ... I haven't had a winning season since I left college, and it feels great to win again.\"  In 1994, McCants went to the Cardinals, following Buddy Ryan to Arizona after he was named head coach.  In a game against the Chicago Bears, McCants picked off Steve Walsh and ran back a 46-yard touchdown; it was the Cardinals' longest interception return of the season.

In a review in The Boston Globe, Saul Austerlitz called it a \"wickedly funny new novel\". USA Today noted, \"no novelist writing today is more engaging and entertaining when it comes to questions of race, class and commercial culture than Colson Whitehead,\" concluding that the novel \"gets to the heart of the thing, but in a delightfully roundabout way\". The San Francisco Chronicle gave the novel a mixed review, commenting, \"It's pure joy to read writing like this, but watching Whitehead sketch out a minor character's essence with one stroke, while breathtaking, makes one wish the same treatment was afforded the people who ostensibly inhabit the novel's complex ideas.\" American trade news magazine Publishers Weekly reacted negatively to the book, writing, \"Whitehead disappoints in this intriguingly conceived but static tale of a small town with an identity crisis.\"Erin Aubry Kaplan of the Los Angeles Times noted, \"too often, [Whitehead] can't resist the temptation of irony, and his big ideas are sometimes overwhelmed by one wink-wink or metaphor too many.\" Kirkus Reviews praised the book, writing, \"while making no attempt at depth of characterization, Whitehead audaciously blurs the line between social realism and fabulist satire.\" The Library Journal praised the book, noting, \"in spare and evocative prose, Whitehead does Shakespeare one better: What's in a name, and how does our identity relate to our own sense of who we are?\" The New York Observer was critical of the book but noted, \"readers not looking for direct emotional access to the characters may find it gratifying to solve the intellectual puzzle set here by Colson Whitehead.\"Scott Esposito of webzine PopMatters gave the novel mixed comments, writing, \"it is no surprise that Apex Hides the Hurt, Whitehead's third novel, is packed with a number of allegorical elements blended into a multi-layered structure.

PMtoday is frequently recognized for their combination of progressive rock, alternative rock and post-hardcore. Thomas Nassiff of AbsolutePunk said that PMtoday \"are at their best when they're switching up their sound, going from blistering guitar work to gently woven melodies.\" He also compared them to Circa Survive, Brand New, and also classified them as indie rock. Adam Thomas of Sputnikmusic said that In Medias Res would \"likely end up being one of the best post-hardcore albums to come out in 2010.\"The band also made heavy use of alternating, harmonized and counterpoint vocals, with other band members beside Connor also contributing to vocals. In the earliest inception of the band Connor Brogan was the lead vocalist, with Ryan Brogan providing secondary vocals. Justin Coulter provided backing vocals and occasional screamed vocals, and was replaced in 2005 by Kevin Middleton. In their last line-up, this format was expanded to include all four members, although all vocals for In Medias Res were recorded by Connor.\nThe band's second album, In Medias Res, was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Indie Vision Music, who gave the album a positive review, said that \"perseverance is not the word that immediately comes to mind when [he] think[s] of most bands; however, when thinking of pmtoday it certainly fits\" and said that when he \"think[s] of Rise [Records] [he] think[s] of post-hardcore, but [In Medias Res] throws that thinking out the window.\" They closed the review saying that the \"album is a solid Rise debut release and is a must buy for any progressive indie rock fan.\"Phil Freeman, a writer for Alternative Press, gave the album a positive review compared PMtoday to the \"earliest Mars Volta recordings, before Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez decided every flubbed note he recorded deserved its own solo album\" due to their \"funk rock riffing and blistering tempos.\" He closed the review with:\n\nThese guys are outrageously talented--good-to-great lyricists/songwriters and astonishing musicians (the two don't always go hand in hand). They never settle for screaming and distortion when a more thoughtful approach will yield bigger dividends, but they also hardly ever miss an opportunity to shred. They deserve to be huge; this is one of the best albums of 2010 so far, and a mind-roasting debut.\nChris Marshman, a writer for webzine Alter the Press!, gave the album a positive review, stating that the album starts with a \"somewhat dampening opener\", referring to \"Thoughts In Transit\", and comments that a listener \"could be forgiven for thinking that [they]\u2019re not in for a very enjoyable listen. Take that stance and [they]\u2019re wrong, because what In Medias Res is, is an album full of twists and turns that any attempt to guess what might be coming up will almost certainly be wrong.\" He closed the review with\n\nAll in all, despite some small inconsistencies, what we have here is a technically outstanding album. [...] Despite the differences in the sounds of songs, it all blends together effortlessly and what could have been a hefty gamble for an album has turned into a resounding success.\nJoshua Khan of Ultimate Guitar Archive also gave the album a positive review, stating that \"guitarists Connor and Cuinn Brogan shred their way across the disc's ten tracks, transforming indie rock melodies into post-hardcore breakdowns with a hint of pop. The combination seems unrealistic and fake, but the outcome is almost breathtaking. Numerous bands have swayed from progressive rock set in stone by bands such as Coheed and Cambria, and PMtoday rejuvenate it without undertones that are incredibly dark.\" He also made a note of the track \"Don't Exist\", stating that it \"starts like an indie pop track and turns into a constant battle of melodic riffs. Such unexpected turns are littered throughout the record, along with intense jam sessions reminiscent of [Mars Volta], leaving listeners hanging on to every moment the band conjures a breakdown.\"  He closed the review with:\n\nIt doesn't have a polished force behind it like albums from Coheed And Cambria and Circa Survive, but the sophomore full-length from PMtoday does reek of potential. Instead of blatantly talking about girls and trying to make every line rhyme, the band questions listeners with interesting lyrics and a sound that could seem nostalgic even though it was popular less than five years ago.

Despite his height, he was also extremely agile. A dead-ball specialist, Rivaldo was renowned for his bending free kicks and penalty taking, as well as his ability to score from distance with powerful strikes. Left footed and possessing excellent technique, he was also known for his ball striking from volleys, and for having a penchant for scoring from bicycle kicks.\nApart from a right foot, Rivaldo had everything. His wiry strength allowed him to bounce off defenders, he was an outstanding dribbler, and he had a left foot that was both educated and thuggish, subtle and a sledgehammer. Brazil's bandy-legged genius was the most unstoppable footballer since Maradona.\nAlthough he was not a true striker, Rivaldo was a prolific goalscorer, capable of playing in several creative and offensive positions: during the prime of his career, a period where he won the Ballon d'Or and was named FIFA World Player of the Year, he was often deployed in a playmaking attacking midfield role as a classic number 10, due to his vision and passing ability, which made him an excellent assist provider. He could also function as a second striker, or as a left winger, a position which he often occupied earlier in his career, due to his acceleration and crossing ability. Although predominantly left footed, he was capable of playing on either wing.In 2002, John Carlin of The Guardian noted that Rivaldo \"combines to dazzling effect the two essential qualities of the ideal footballer: artistry and efficiency.\" His colleague, Rob Smyth, echoed his views in 2008, commenting: \"if you could marry British will with continental skill, you would have the perfect footballer. Such a mixed recipe was thrillingly in evidence in Diego Maradona. Since then, however, perhaps only Rivaldo has fused the two qualities,\" noting that like the Argentinian, the Brazilian had \"bronca\" (the word used repeatedly in Maradona's autobiography to refer to \"anger, fury, hatred, resentment, bitter discontent).

{"id": "413_697", "question": "What position does Gary Smith play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27223", "text": "The Indian Princess is one example of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American national identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation's history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.Barker also had commercial interests, and was motivated by a drive for artistic and financial success. In this vein, the play was an attempt to please the anglophile public, but create something truly American in setting and theme. The portrayals of the Indians in the play, from a perspective of racial sensitivity, have been met with mixed reviews by modern critics.  Some write positively about the portrayals, saying that, other than Grimosco and Miami, the natives are noble, though primitive, and have a more \"American\" value system than the savages traditionally portrayed in British media of the period. Others, however, see the characters portrayed stereotypically as lusty, childlike, weak and corruptible beings, with the exceptions of Pocahontas and Nantaquas, who are portrayed positively only because they accept English values.  Still others take a middle ground, noting the range of representations.  In any case, the play can be seen as a justification of White assimilation of the natives, especially when examining Pocahontas's choice to be with Rolfe as a microcosm of their societies.Critics have pointed out several inherent flaws in the script, including the early placement of the play's climax (Smith at the chopping block) at the beginning of Act II, loose construction,  song lyrics that trivialize characters, and a main character in Pocahontas that is somewhat stilted and overly poetic.  In contrast, however others have argued that Pocahontas's love scene in Act III is where the truest poetry of the piece emerges.There has been less critique of Bray's musical work, but Victor Fell Yellin tried to recreate what he felt was the score's melodic expressiveness and sonorous grandeur in his 1978 recording of it. In the liner notes, he points out that the music does not critically compare with the great musical masters of its time, but its success is derived from its charm. While it lacks modulation, it contains well-turned melodic and rhythmic phrases, and syncopations that add to its American style.The Indian Princess certainly began a long American tradition of romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, who was only a child in Smith's original accounts. Therefore, it deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre, but it can be criticized for diminishing the potential richness of the subject matter.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was a backup in Super Bowl XIV as a member of the Los Angeles Rams, he was a backup to Super Bowl MVP Phil Simms in Super Bowl XXI as a member of the New York Giants, and was a backup in Super Bowl XXVI as a member of the Washington Redskins. His most notable play with the Giants came in Super Bowl XXI in the third quarter. On fourth down with a yard needed, he was sent by head coach Bill Parcells for a potential decoy play. When the other team did not pick up on Rutledge, he took the snap and did a sneak up the middle for yardage that gave the Giants a first down that would eventually lead to a go-ahead score.\nHis finest moment as a professional player came when as a member of the Redskins he came off the bench in a game versus the Detroit Lions in 1990.

He had his feature film debut in the 1985 film Compromising Positions, starring Susan Sarandon, and in 1986 had his first recurring role on television on the HBO situation comedy series 1st & Ten. He starred alongside O. J. Simpson and Sam J. Jones in HBO's sequel to 1st & Ten titled Training Camp: The Bulls Are Back, and John Voorhees of The Seattle Times wrote: \"The cast, which includes O.J. Simpson, Sam Jones and newcomer Jason Beghe, is first-rate.\"In 1988, he starred in the film Monkey Shines: An Experiment In Fear, directed by George A. Romero. He portrayed Allan Mann, a law student made quadriplegic when hit by a truck in the opening credits of the film. The Philadelphia Inquirer gave a positive review of Beghe's performance in Monkey Shines: \"Acting only with his face and voice, Jason Beghe is terrific at conveying the mounting anger and rage of an active man made passive\". David Foil of The Advocate described Beghe's performance as \"remarkable simply for meeting the demands of the character\".Beghe played an ice hockey star in the Perry Mason TV film The Case of the All-Star Assassin, an NBC-TV telefeature broadcast November 19, 1989. In 1991, he played a State Trooper in the film Thelma & Louise (reuniting him with Sarandon, with whom he'd appeared in Compromising Positions), and was Demi Moore's love interest in the 1997 film G.I. Jane. He had recurring roles on Picket Fences and Melrose Place, and became a cast member of Chicago Hope in 1997, portraying electrician Danny Blaines opposite romantic interest Dr. Austin played by Christine Lahti. In a 1997 interview in The Boston Herald, Beghe spoke about his respect for his fellow cast members in Chicago Hope: \"I think it's the best cast assembled that I've ever seen. One for one, they're incredible. And to work with Christine Lahti? I'd drop a lot of things for that. She's so good and smart and dedicated. I've become a better actor just for working with her.\" He commented on his character on Melrose Place, a closeted military officer who had feelings for Matt, played by Doug Savant: \"I thought we should kiss, but it was too much. TV is a very specific medium, and you're naive if you think that everything is just based on artistic decisions. If it prevents them from selling some products, that's a major consideration.

He played the character novelist Richard Bates, a friend of character Hank Moody (played by David Duchovny). \"Bates, played by Jason Beghe, made for an interesting character and the fact that he didn't get as much screen time as some of the other characters is a shame,\" wrote Danny Gallagher of TV Squad.

The clapper is a metal sphere approximately 4 mm (3\u204416 in) in diameter suspended between the piles, which rings the bells alternately due to electrostatic forces. When the clapper touches one bell, it is charged by that pile. It is then repelled from that bell due to having the same charge and attracted to the other bell, which has the opposite charge. The clapper then touches the other bell and the process reverses, leading to oscillation. The use of electrostatic forces means that while high voltage is required to create motion, only a tiny amount of charge is carried from one bell to the other. As a result, the batteries drain very slowly, which is why the piles have been able to last since the apparatus was set up in 1840. Its oscillation frequency is 2 hertz.The exact composition of the dry piles is unknown, but it is known that they have been coated with molten sulfur for insulation and it is thought that they may be Zamboni piles.At one point this sort of device played an important role in distinguishing between two different theories of electrical action: the theory of contact tension (an obsolete scientific theory based on then-prevailing electrostatic principles) and the theory of chemical action.The Oxford Electric Bell does not demonstrate perpetual motion.

Still, McCants' strength and 4.51 second time in the 40-yard dash guaranteed he would still be a high pick, if not #1. After being drafted fourth overall by the Buccaneers in 1990, McCants signed a 5-year, $7.4 million deal with the team, including a then-record $2.5 million cash signing bonus.  A highly touted prospect, McCants rookie card by Score quoted former Kentucky head coach Jerry Claiborne as saying \"Keith is one of the best football players I have ever seen.  Have you ever seen a linebacker as big as he is? I never have.  He looks like an elephant and he runs like a deer\". Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins said that \"He plays like he is never out of the play. That is an intensity level I like\".Floyd Peters was brought to the Bucs in 1991, and converted McCants from a linebacker to defensive end. Although McCants resisted the change, Peters convinced him that with time he could become a success story along the lines of Chris Doleman, another Peters conversion. Although privately unhappy he accepted the position, and tried to make the best of it, claiming \"Teams won't take me lightly. I can tell you that...I can play any position on this football team, except maybe quarterback. When this season is over, I could be in the Pro Bowl. You don't know how hungry I am. It doesn't matter what position I'm playing. What matters is me.\"Although McCants was not fond of the move, he did have some success, as he led the Buccaneers in 1991 with 34 quarterback pressures and recorded 5 sacks, prompting Patrick Zier of the New York Times to remark \"considering the circumstances, McCants first year was a success. . .despite having to learn an entirely new position\". In December 1991, Coach Peters told the media \"I think he's played a decent season.  If you watch films, Keith is a producer.\"  McCants continued to build upon his experience and was second on the Buccaneers in sacks (5) and quarterback pressures (21) in 1992. Eventually, Tampa Bay cut him during their 1993 training camp.\nWithin 48 hours, he was picked up off waivers by the New England Patriots, where he was reunited once again with Ray Perkins, then New England's Offensive coordinator.  Regarding his cut from the Bucs and resigning, McCants remarked at the time \"This is a lot off my shoulders...The rumors had been spreading for some time now concerning my future with Tampa.\" He played in a preseason game the day he was signed, against the Kansas City Chiefs, before being released.\nIn 1993 while with the Houston Oilers, McCants stepped in to separate Buddy Ryan and Kevin Gilbride when Ryan punched Gilbride in the face following an Oilers fumble.  That season, the Oilers would go on to finish first in the AFC Central Division, sending them to their seventh straight postseason, and McCants's first.  When asked what it meant to go to the playoffs, McCants replied, \"Let me tell you something, this is big-time. This is football ... I haven't had a winning season since I left college, and it feels great to win again.\"  In 1994, McCants went to the Cardinals, following Buddy Ryan to Arizona after he was named head coach.  In a game against the Chicago Bears, McCants picked off Steve Walsh and ran back a 46-yard touchdown; it was the Cardinals' longest interception return of the season.  In 1995 McCants scored his second NFL touchdown, on a fumble recovery against the Seattle Seahawks.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Doby said in an interview later, \"One of the things that was disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I think that's one of the reasons why Josh died so early \u2014 he was heartbroken.\"In 1972, Gibson and Buck Leonard became the second and third players, behind Satchel Paige, inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame based on their careers in the Negro leagues. Gibson's Hall of Fame plaque claims \"almost 800\" home runs for his career, although this number cannot be substantiated.\nAlthough validation of statistics continues to prove difficult for Negro league players, the lack of verifiable figures has led to various amusing tall tales about players such as Gibson. An example of such:  In the bottom of the ninth at Pittsburgh, down a run, with a runner on base and two outs, Gibson hits one high and deep, so far into the twilight sky that it disappears, apparently winning the game. The next day, the same two teams are playing again, now in Washington. Just as the teams have positioned themselves on the field, a ball falls out of the sky, and a Washington outfielder grabs it. The umpire yells to Gibson, \"You're out! In Pittsburgh, yesterday!\"The U.S. Postal Service issued a 33-cent U.S. commemorative postage stamp which features a painting of Gibson and includes his name.In 2000, he ranked 18th on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking of five players to have played all or most of their careers in the Negro leagues. (The others were Satchel Paige, Buck Leonard, Cool Papa Bell and Oscar Charleston.) He was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in the same year.\nAt PNC Park, home of Pittsburgh's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, an exhibit honoring the city's two Negro league baseball teams was introduced in 2006. Located by the stadium's left field entrance and named Legacy Square, the display featured statues of seven players who competed for the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords, including Gibson. In 2015, without any public announcement, the Pirates removed all seven statues from the Legacy Square area. Ultimately, they were donated to the Josh Gibson Foundation and sold at auction to benefit the Foundation. Most of the statues that were originally located at Legacy Square in PNC Park, including Gibson's, are now displayed at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.In 2009, a statue of Gibson was installed inside the center field gate of Nationals Park along with ones of Frank Howard and Walter Johnson.\nHe was named to the Washington Nationals Ring of Honor for his \"significant contribution to the game of baseball in Washington, D.C\" as part of the Homestead Grays on August 10, 2010.\nAmmon Field in Pittsburgh was renamed Josh Gibson Field in his honor and is the site of a Pennsylvania State Historical Marker.His son, Josh Gibson, Jr., played baseball for the Homestead Grays.

Kennedy Sr., a politician and businessman, and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, a philanthropist and socialite. He was the seventh of their nine children. Robert described his position in the family hierarchy by saying, \"When you come from that far down, you have to struggle to survive.\" His parents were members of two prominent Irish-American families that were active in the Massachusetts Democratic Party. All four of Kennedy's grandparents were children of Irish immigrants. His eight siblings were Joseph Jr., John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Jean, and Ted. \nStarting from a solidly middle-class family in Boston, his father created a fortune through a variety of activities and established trust funds for his nine children that guaranteed lifelong financial independence. Turning to politics, Joe Sr. became a leading figure in the Democratic Party and had the money and connections to play a central role in the family's political ambitions. During Robert's childhood, his father dubbed him the \"runt\" of the family and wrote him off; focusing greater attention on his two eldest sons, Joseph, Jr., and John. His parents involved their children in discussions of history and current affairs at the family dinner table. \"I can hardly remember a mealtime,\" Kennedy reflected, \"when the conversation was not dominated by what Franklin D. Roosevelt was doing or what was happening in the world.\"As his father's business success expanded, Kennedy and his family lived in increasing prosperity in Massachusetts, New York, and Florida, as well as London, where his father served as the U.S. ambassador to the Court of St James's from 1938 to 1940. The house that Kennedy and his siblings most associated with home was known as the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where they enjoyed swimming, sailing, and touch football.

{"id": "413_796", "question": "What position does Juan Cuadrado play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "413_9732", "text": "Cuadrado is known for his direct, offensive style of play along the right flank, and is capable of both scoring goals himself, courtesy of his striking ability from distance, as well as creating goalscoring opportunities for his teammates. He is capable of playing both as a wide midfielder, or as a winger in an attacking trident, due to his ability to make attacking runs down the wing. He often utilises his speed, flair, and technical skills to beat opponents in one on one situations and create space and time for him to shoot on goal, or deliver crosses to strikers in the area. Due to his playing style, which frequently involves taking on full-backs on the flank, and subsequently running towards the touch-line to deliver balls into the area, he has been labelled one of the few \"traditional\" wide midfielders in the current game.Tim Vickery, a reporter on South American football, stated that as Colombia's defensive players played near the goal in order to cover for veteran centre-back Mario Yepes, Cuadrado's pace, agility, creativity and dribbling ability on the right wing moved the team forward at the 2014 World Cup. Vickery also added that, in addition to his main role on the wing, Cuadrado is also adept as an attacking right back or wing back, due to his energy and work rate, as well as his other aforementioned qualities; he has also been used in this position more recently at Juventus, under managers Massimiliano Allegri, Maurizio Sarri, and Andrea Pirlo. A versatile player, he is also capable of playing on the left, a position which allows him to cut into the middle and shoot on goal with his stronger, right foot. In his early career, he was initially deployed as central or defensive midfielder, and was even deployed as an outright forward or striker; he is also capable of playing as an attacking midfielder, or as a second striker on occasion, and has even been used as a more offensive-minded central midfielder at times, known as the mezz'ala role, in Italian (which literally translates to \"half-winger\").Despite his talent and ability, Cuadrado's decision-making and reading of the game have been criticised at times in the media; moreover, he has also drawn criticism at times from some in the sport for being inconsistent, and for having an overly individualistic playing style. In 2017, Mina Rzouki of ESPN FC noted that \"Cuadrado has yet to learn the art of making decisive runs on a consistent basis. Still naive and capable of slowing down a game despite his pace, he does not boast the football intelligence of a world-beater.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was later called into the Iraq U-19s by Adnan Hamad. Against Pakistan, he was instrumental in the 6\u20130 demolition setting 2 goals in 6 minutes, the 2nd Nashat was involved in the beginning of a move on the Iraqi left, then he reappeared on the right-hand edge of the penalty area to put Emad Mohammed through with an exquisite back heel that took three defenders out of the play, leaving Emad free to score. He was a regular until he was replaced at half time against Korea Republic due to a tactical change, he later made appearances late on in games and created openings with his inspirational play. In the final Nashat's long ball forward caused confusion between Shohei Ikeda and his goalkeeper, which resulted in a weak clearing header by Fujigaya. The ball fell to Emad who hooked the ball over both players to score the winner.While many footballers are admired for their footwork or dominance in the air, Nashat Akram impresses with his cunning. After steering Iraq to their maiden success at the AFC Asian Cup 2007 with his intelligent midfield prompting, the cool-headed playmaker instantly became a popular figure across the continent.\nHowever, long before he made a name for himself at the senior level, Akram attracted attention across Asia when his creativity helped Iraq win the AFC Youth Championship 2000. That same year, the 17-year-old made it into the first team of Iraqi giants Al-Shorta. After a series of brilliant performances, which included helping the team to glory in the Umm Al-Marek Cup and reaching the Iraq FA Cup final in 2002, the midfield prodigy began to be heralded as one of Asia's most promising talents.\nAnd it did not take Akram long to live up to these sizeable expectations. Though still a teenager, he was instrumental in Iraq's qualification for both the Asian Cup 2004 and the Olympic Football Tournament Athens 2004. His excellent vision and defence-piercing passes \u2013 skills rarely seen in players his age \u2013 captivated national coach Adnan Hamad, who appointed Akram captain, despite being one of the youngest players on the senior team.\nAkram did not let his coach down and impressed throughout Iraq's campaign in the AFC Asian Cup 2004. He also revealed his goalscoring ability when he was on target in the 2\u20131 win over Saudi Arabia in the final group match, a result which sent them through to the last eight at the Saudis' expense.\nIt was not the first goal that he scored for the national team, nor has it been the last. He hit the mark again in Iraq's memorable 3\u20131 win over Australia in a group match in the AFC Asian Cup 2007, before slamming home to seal a 2\u20131 victory over hosts China in a qualifier for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa.\nDespite winning the continental title, Iraq's disappointing qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup has left Akram and his teammates with the feeling that they still have something to prove. After making his national team debut against Saudi Arabia in a qualifying match for the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan, the 24-year-old also figured in Iraq's more recent qualifying campaigns, both times with little success.

Armstrong himself often claimed he was born on July 4, 1900. His parents were Mary Estelle \"Mayann\" Albert and William Armstrong. Mary Albert was from Boutte, Louisiana, and gave birth at home when she was about sixteen. Less than a year and a half later, they had a daughter, Beatrice \"Mama Lucy\" Armstrong (1903\u20131987), who was raised by Albert. William Armstrong abandoned the family shortly thereafter.Louis Armstrong was raised by his grandmother until the age of five, when he was returned to his mother. He spent his youth in poverty in a rough neighborhood known as The Battlefield, on the southern section of Rampart Street. At six he started attending the Fisk School for Boys, a school that accepted black children in the racially segregated school system of New Orleans.\nDuring this time, Armstrong lived with his mother and sister and worked for the Karnoffskys, a family of Lithuanian Jews, at their home. He helped their two sons, Morris and Alex, collect \"rags and bones\" and deliver coal. In 1969, while recovering from heart and kidney problems at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, Armstrong wrote a memoir called Louis Armstrong + the Jewish Family in New Orleans, LA., the year of 1907, describing his time working for the Karnoffsky family.Armstrong writes about singing \"Russian Lullaby\" with the Karnoffsky family when their baby son David was put to bed, and credits the family with teaching him to sing \"from the heart.\" Curiously, Armstrong quotes lyrics for it that appear to be the same as the \"Russian Lullaby\", copyrighted by Irving Berlin in 1927, about twenty years after Armstrong remembered singing it as a child. Gary Zucker, Armstrong's doctor at Beth Israel hospital in 1969, shared Berlin's song lyrics with him, and Armstrong quoted them in the memoir. This inaccuracy may simply be because he wrote the memoir over 60 years after the events described. Regardless, the Karnoffskys treated Armstrong extremely well. Knowing he lived without a father, they fed and nurtured him.In his memoir, Louis Armstrong + the Jewish Family in New Orleans, La., the Year of 1907, he described his discovery that this family was also subject to discrimination by \"other white folks\" who felt that they were better than Jews: \"I was only seven years old but I could easily see the ungodly treatment that the white folks were handing the poor Jewish family whom I worked for.\" He wrote about what he learned from them: \"how to live\u2014real life and determination.\" His first musical performance may have been at the side of the Karnoffskys' junk wagon. To distinguish them from other hawkers, he tried playing a tin horn to attract customers. Morris Karnoffsky gave Armstrong an advance toward the purchase of a cornet from a pawn shop.\nLater as an adult, Armstrong wore a Star of David given to him by his Jewish manager, Joe Glaser, until the end of his life, in part  in memory of this family who had raised him.When Armstrong was eleven, he dropped out of school. His mother moved into a one-room house on Perdido Street with Armstrong, Lucy, and her common-law husband, Tom Lee, next door to her brother Ike and his two sons. Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. Cornetist Bunk Johnson said he taught the eleven-year-old to play by ear at Dago Tony's honky tonk. In his later years Armstrong credited King Oliver. He said about his youth, \"Every time I close my eyes blowing that trumpet of mine\u2014I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans ... It has given me something to live for.\"\nBorrowing his stepfather's gun without permission, he fired a blank into the air and was arrested on December 31, 1912. He spent the night at New Orleans Juvenile Court, and was sentenced the next day to detention at the Colored Waif's Home. Life at the home was spartan. Mattresses were absent. Meals were often little more than bread and molasses. Captain Joseph Jones ran the home like a military camp and used corporal punishment.Armstrong developed his cornet skills by playing in the band. Peter Davis, who frequently appeared at the home at the request of Captain Jones, became Armstrong's first teacher and chose him as bandleader. With this band, the thirteen-year-old Armstrong attracted the attention of Kid Ory.On June 14, 1914, Armstrong was released into the custody of his father and his new stepmother, Gertrude. He lived in this household with two stepbrothers for several months. After Gertrude gave birth to a daughter, Armstrong's father never welcomed him, so he returned to his mother, Mary Albert. In her small home, he had to share a bed with his mother and sister. His mother still lived in The Battlefield, leaving him open to old temptations, but he sought work as a musician.He found a job at a dance hall owned by Henry Ponce, who had connections to organized crime. He met the six-foot tall drummer Black Benny, who became his guide and bodyguard. Around the age of fifteen, he pimped for a prostitute named Nootsy, but that relationship failed after she stabbed Armstrong in the shoulder and his mother choked her nearly to death.He briefly studied shipping management at the local community college, but was forced to quit after being unable to afford the fees. While selling coal in Storyville, he heard spasm bands, groups that played music out of household objects. He heard the early sounds of jazz from bands that played in brothels and dance halls such as Pete Lala's, where King Oliver performed.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Still, McCants' strength and 4.51 second time in the 40-yard dash guaranteed he would still be a high pick, if not #1. After being drafted fourth overall by the Buccaneers in 1990, McCants signed a 5-year, $7.4 million deal with the team, including a then-record $2.5 million cash signing bonus.  A highly touted prospect, McCants rookie card by Score quoted former Kentucky head coach Jerry Claiborne as saying \"Keith is one of the best football players I have ever seen.  Have you ever seen a linebacker as big as he is? I never have.  He looks like an elephant and he runs like a deer\". Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins said that \"He plays like he is never out of the play. That is an intensity level I like\".Floyd Peters was brought to the Bucs in 1991, and converted McCants from a linebacker to defensive end. Although McCants resisted the change, Peters convinced him that with time he could become a success story along the lines of Chris Doleman, another Peters conversion. Although privately unhappy he accepted the position, and tried to make the best of it, claiming \"Teams won't take me lightly. I can tell you that...I can play any position on this football team, except maybe quarterback. When this season is over, I could be in the Pro Bowl. You don't know how hungry I am. It doesn't matter what position I'm playing. What matters is me.\"Although McCants was not fond of the move, he did have some success, as he led the Buccaneers in 1991 with 34 quarterback pressures and recorded 5 sacks, prompting Patrick Zier of the New York Times to remark \"considering the circumstances, McCants first year was a success. . .despite having to learn an entirely new position\". In December 1991, Coach Peters told the media \"I think he's played a decent season.  If you watch films, Keith is a producer.\"  McCants continued to build upon his experience and was second on the Buccaneers in sacks (5) and quarterback pressures (21) in 1992. Eventually, Tampa Bay cut him during their 1993 training camp.\nWithin 48 hours, he was picked up off waivers by the New England Patriots, where he was reunited once again with Ray Perkins, then New England's Offensive coordinator.  Regarding his cut from the Bucs and resigning, McCants remarked at the time \"This is a lot off my shoulders...The rumors had been spreading for some time now concerning my future with Tampa.\" He played in a preseason game the day he was signed, against the Kansas City Chiefs, before being released.\nIn 1993 while with the Houston Oilers, McCants stepped in to separate Buddy Ryan and Kevin Gilbride when Ryan punched Gilbride in the face following an Oilers fumble.  That season, the Oilers would go on to finish first in the AFC Central Division, sending them to their seventh straight postseason, and McCants's first.  When asked what it meant to go to the playoffs, McCants replied, \"Let me tell you something, this is big-time. This is football ... I haven't had a winning season since I left college, and it feels great to win again.\"  In 1994, McCants went to the Cardinals, following Buddy Ryan to Arizona after he was named head coach.  In a game against the Chicago Bears, McCants picked off Steve Walsh and ran back a 46-yard touchdown; it was the Cardinals' longest interception return of the season.

Titus agrees, although Lavinia is already betrothed to Saturninus's brother, Bassianus, who refuses to give her up. Titus's sons tell Titus that Bassianus is in the right under Roman law, but Titus refuses to listen, accusing them all of treason. A scuffle breaks out, during which Titus kills his own son, Mutius. Saturninus then denounces the Andronici family for their effrontery and shocks Titus by marrying Tamora. Putting into motion her plan for revenge, Tamora advises Saturninus to pardon Bassianus and the Andronici family, which he reluctantly does.\nDuring a royal hunt the following day, Aaron persuades Demetrius and Chiron to kill Bassianus so that they may rape Lavinia. They do so, throwing Bassianus's body into a pit and dragging Lavinia deep into the forest before violently raping her. To keep her from revealing what has happened, they cut out her tongue and cut off her hands. Meanwhile, Aaron writes a forged letter, which frames Titus's sons Martius and Quintus for the murder of Bassianus. Horrified at the death of his brother, Saturninus arrests Martius and Quintus and sentences them to death.\nSome time later, Marcus discovers the mutilated Lavinia and takes her to her father, who is still shocked at the accusations levelled at his sons, and upon seeing Lavinia, he is overcome with grief. Aaron then visits Titus and falsely tells him that Saturninus will spare Martius and Quintus if either Titus, Marcus, or Titus' remaining son, Lucius, cuts off one of their hands and sends it to him. Though Marcus and Lucius are willing, Titus has his own left hand cut off by Aaron and sends it to the emperor. However, a messenger brings back Martius's and Quintus's severed heads, along with Titus's own severed hand. Desperate for revenge, Titus orders Lucius to flee Rome and raise an army among their former enemy, the Goths.\nLater, Lavinia writes the names of her attackers in the dirt, using a stick held with her mouth and between her arms. Meanwhile, Aaron is informed that Tamora has secretly given birth to a mixed-race baby, fathered by Aaron, which will draw Saturninus's wrath. Though Tamora wants the baby killed, Aaron kills the nurse to keep the child's race a secret and flees to raise his son among the Goths. Thereafter, Lucius, marching on Rome with an army, captures Aaron and threatens to hang the infant. In order to save the baby, Aaron reveals the entire revenge plot to Lucius.\n\nBack in Rome, Titus's behaviour suggests he might be deranged. Convinced of Titus's madness, Tamora, Demetrius, and Chiron (dressed as the spirits of Revenge, Murder, and Rape, respectively) approach Titus in order to persuade him to have Lucius remove his troops from Rome. Tamora (as Revenge) tells Titus that she will grant him revenge on all of his enemies if he convinces Lucius to postpone the imminent attack on Rome. Titus agrees and sends Marcus to invite Lucius to a reconciliatory feast. Revenge then offers to invite the Emperor and Tamora as well, and is about to leave when Titus insists that Rape and Murder stay with him. When Tamora is gone, Titus has Chiron and Demetrius restrained, cuts their throats, and drains their blood into a basin held by Lavinia. Titus tells Lavinia that he will \"play the cook\", grind the bones of Demetrius and Chiron into powder, and bake their heads into two pies, which he will serve to their mother.\nThe next day, during the feast at his house, Titus asks Saturninus if a father should kill his daughter when she has been raped. When Saturninus answers that he should, Titus kills Lavinia and tells Saturninus of the rape. When the Emperor calls for Chiron and Demetrius, Titus reveals that they were baked in the pies Tamora has already been eating. Titus then kills Tamora and is immediately killed by Saturninus, who is subsequently killed by Lucius to avenge his father's death. Lucius is then proclaimed Emperor. He orders that Titus and Lavinia be laid in their family tomb, that Saturninus be given a state burial, that Tamora's body be thrown to the wild beasts outside the city, and that Aaron be hanged. Aaron, however, is unrepentant to the end, regretting only that he did not do more evil in his life. Lucius decides Aaron deserves to be buried chest-deep as punishment and left to die of thirst and starvation, and Aaron is taken away to be punished thus.", "hasanswer": false}]}

On this trip, Princeton University's contribution to that all-star-Ivy team, John Malcolm, encountered a Princeton alum, Dean Carney (also a pseudonym). Carney was an executive in Kidder Peabody's Tokyo office, and he suggested Malcolm contact him about a job if his pro football career did not pan out.\nWhen it did not, and following a job search on Wall Street, Malcolm contacted Carney in 1993. Malcolm then became one of KP's two Osaka-based traders. This lasted until April 1994, when KP discovered a $350 million \"accounting glitch,\" and assigned responsibility for the glitch to one of its managing directors, Joseph Jett. KP (and its corporate parent, General Electric) made sweeping cutbacks in their trading operations as a result. Both Carney and Malcolm\u2014neither of whom had anything to do with Jett's accounting trickery\u2014were out of jobs, and they went their separate ways.\nMalcolm took a position with a venerable English bank, Barings. He was again to work out of Osaka, but this time his orders were coming from Singapore, where Barings' star trader, Nick Leeson, held court.  Leeson, though, was making huge unauthorized trades during this period. In January 1995 he made an enormous bet on a rise in the key Japanese stock exchange index, known as the Nikkei (large enough so that if he won, he would recover all his losses). However, the huge bet went against him, due to the Kobe earthquake (January 17) and its devastating effects on Japan's economy. After a brief period as a fugitive, Leeson was captured and did prison time. Meanwhile, Barings suffered historic loses from the gamble, and later went into receivership.\nFor the second time in eight months, a superior's malfeasance had cost Malcolm a job. He called Carney for help. Carney, meanwhile, had founded a hedge fund, and Malcolm was soon trading for it, primarily index arbitrage.  In 1994, the Hong Kong government created a tracker fund for the Hang Seng (the Hong Kong equivalent of the Dow Jones or the Nikkei; see Tracker Fund of Hong Kong). In 1995, after Malcolm was settled into his Tokyo job, a company named Pacific Century Cyberworks (PCC) merged with Hong Kong Telecom, and under the terms of the tracker funds' charter, its managers had to buy $225 million worth of PCC stock. This was widely known, and so several traders were \"front running\" this deal, i.e. buying PCC stock ahead of the fund's expected purchases.\nMalcolm, though, discovered that the tracker fund was not going to buy the PCC stock through the exchanges at all. It made a private off-exchange deal with PCC's founder Richard Li. This meant that, when the day of the expected fund purchases arrived and no purchases took place, there'd be a strong downward pressure on the stock price. Accordingly, on Malcolm's suggestion, Carney's hedge fund took a \"short\" position on $100 million of PCC stock. In the event, the tracking fund did not make the expected purchases, and the price dropped dramatically\u2014Malcolm covered the short position, winning his firm more than twenty million dollars. This one deal made Malcolm a star, known to expat western traders throughout east Asia as their \"hot young gunslinger.\"\nThe ending of the book turns on another, quite similar, but even larger deal involving the addition to the Nikkei index of several high-tech firms. This is the deal that justifies the book\u2014Malcolm made Carney's firm five hundred million dollars in cash out of the restructuring of the Nikkei. Disillusioned, Malcolm then leaves Carney's employ and heads for semi-retirement in Bermuda, where he still does light trading.\nOther elements which Mezrich intertwines into the narrative with the main characters include the sex industry in Japan and the role of the Yakuza in Japanese society and finance.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1973, Mohammad Reza told the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci:A king who does not need to account to anyone for what he says and does is unavoidably doomed to loneliness. However, I am not entirely alone, because a force others can't perceive accompanies me. My mystical force. Moreover, I receive messages. I have lived with God besides me since I was 5 years old. Since, that is, God sent me those visions.\nMohamed Reza often spoke in public and in private from childhood onward of his belief that God had chosen him for a \"divine mission\" to transform Iran, as he believed that dreams he had as a child of the Twelve Imams of Shia Islam were all messages from God. In his 1961 book Mission for My Country, Mohammad Reza wrote: From the time I was six or seven, I have felt that perhaps there is a supreme being, who is guiding me. I don't know. Sometimes the thought disturbs me because then, I ask myself, what is my own personality, and am I possessed of free will? Still, I often reflect, if I am driven-or perhaps I should say supported-by another force, there must be a reason. In his biography of the Shah, Marvin Zonis has argued that Mohammad Reza really believed in these claims of divine support. Shia Islam has no tradition of describing Shahs being favoured with messages from all, very few Shahs had ever claimed that their dreams were divine messages, and most people in the West laughed at Mohammad Reza's claim that his dreams were messages from God. Reza Khan, who was less religious, dismissed these visions as nonsense, and told his son to have more common sense.Fereydoon Hoveyda, a veteran diplomat who served as the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations (1971\u20131979), and the brother of Amir-Abbas Hoveyda, the Prime Minister under the Shah (1965\u20131977) executed after the Islamic revolution, and himself a critic of the r\u00e9gime who died in exile, says that \"when it comes to religion and spirituality, many passages of the monarch's and Khomeini's publications are interchangeable\", which he perceives as the continuity of the Iranian civilization, where the religion changes but the spirit remains.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation's history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.Barker also had commercial interests, and was motivated by a drive for artistic and financial success. In this vein, the play was an attempt to please the anglophile public, but create something truly American in setting and theme. The portrayals of the Indians in the play, from a perspective of racial sensitivity, have been met with mixed reviews by modern critics.  Some write positively about the portrayals, saying that, other than Grimosco and Miami, the natives are noble, though primitive, and have a more \"American\" value system than the savages traditionally portrayed in British media of the period. Others, however, see the characters portrayed stereotypically as lusty, childlike, weak and corruptible beings, with the exceptions of Pocahontas and Nantaquas, who are portrayed positively only because they accept English values.  Still others take a middle ground, noting the range of representations.  In any case, the play can be seen as a justification of White assimilation of the natives, especially when examining Pocahontas's choice to be with Rolfe as a microcosm of their societies.Critics have pointed out several inherent flaws in the script, including the early placement of the play's climax (Smith at the chopping block) at the beginning of Act II, loose construction,  song lyrics that trivialize characters, and a main character in Pocahontas that is somewhat stilted and overly poetic.  In contrast, however others have argued that Pocahontas's love scene in Act III is where the truest poetry of the piece emerges.There has been less critique of Bray's musical work, but Victor Fell Yellin tried to recreate what he felt was the score's melodic expressiveness and sonorous grandeur in his 1978 recording of it.

Still, McCants' strength and 4.51 second time in the 40-yard dash guaranteed he would still be a high pick, if not #1. After being drafted fourth overall by the Buccaneers in 1990, McCants signed a 5-year, $7.4 million deal with the team, including a then-record $2.5 million cash signing bonus.  A highly touted prospect, McCants rookie card by Score quoted former Kentucky head coach Jerry Claiborne as saying \"Keith is one of the best football players I have ever seen.  Have you ever seen a linebacker as big as he is? I never have.  He looks like an elephant and he runs like a deer\". Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins said that \"He plays like he is never out of the play. That is an intensity level I like\".Floyd Peters was brought to the Bucs in 1991, and converted McCants from a linebacker to defensive end. Although McCants resisted the change, Peters convinced him that with time he could become a success story along the lines of Chris Doleman, another Peters conversion. Although privately unhappy he accepted the position, and tried to make the best of it, claiming \"Teams won't take me lightly. I can tell you that...I can play any position on this football team, except maybe quarterback. When this season is over, I could be in the Pro Bowl. You don't know how hungry I am. It doesn't matter what position I'm playing. What matters is me.\"Although McCants was not fond of the move, he did have some success, as he led the Buccaneers in 1991 with 34 quarterback pressures and recorded 5 sacks, prompting Patrick Zier of the New York Times to remark \"considering the circumstances, McCants first year was a success. . .despite having to learn an entirely new position\". In December 1991, Coach Peters told the media \"I think he's played a decent season.  If you watch films, Keith is a producer.\"  McCants continued to build upon his experience and was second on the Buccaneers in sacks (5) and quarterback pressures (21) in 1992. Eventually, Tampa Bay cut him during their 1993 training camp.\nWithin 48 hours, he was picked up off waivers by the New England Patriots, where he was reunited once again with Ray Perkins, then New England's Offensive coordinator.  Regarding his cut from the Bucs and resigning, McCants remarked at the time \"This is a lot off my shoulders...The rumors had been spreading for some time now concerning my future with Tampa.\" He played in a preseason game the day he was signed, against the Kansas City Chiefs, before being released.\nIn 1993 while with the Houston Oilers, McCants stepped in to separate Buddy Ryan and Kevin Gilbride when Ryan punched Gilbride in the face following an Oilers fumble.  That season, the Oilers would go on to finish first in the AFC Central Division, sending them to their seventh straight postseason, and McCants's first.  When asked what it meant to go to the playoffs, McCants replied, \"Let me tell you something, this is big-time. This is football ... I haven't had a winning season since I left college, and it feels great to win again.\"  In 1994, McCants went to the Cardinals, following Buddy Ryan to Arizona after he was named head coach.  In a game against the Chicago Bears, McCants picked off Steve Walsh and ran back a 46-yard touchdown; it was the Cardinals' longest interception return of the season.

{"id": "413_973", "question": "What position does Aaron Keller play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27839", "text": "The earliest definite recorded performance of Titus was on 24 January 1594, when Philip Henslowe noted a performance by Sussex's Men of Titus & ondronicus. Although Henslowe does not specify a theatre, it was most likely The Rose. Repeated performances were staged on 28 January and 6 February. On 5 and 12 June, Henslowe recorded two further performances of the play, at the Newington Butts Theatre by the combined Admiral's Men and Lord Chamberlain's Men. The 24 January show earned three pounds eight shillings, and the performances on 29 January and 6 February earned two pounds each, making it the most profitable play of the season. The next recorded performance was on 1 January 1596, when a troupe of London actors, possibly Chamberlain's Men, performed the play during the Christmas festivities at Burley-on-the-Hill in the manor of Sir John Harington, Baron of Exton.Some scholars, however, have suggested that the January 1594 performance may not be the first recorded performance of the play. On 11 April 1592, Henslowe recorded ten performances by Derby's Men of a play called Titus and Vespasian, which some, such as E. K. Chambers, have identified with Shakespeare's play. Most scholars, however, believe that Titus and Vespasian is more likely a different play about the two real life Roman Emperors, Vespasian, who ruled from 69 to 79, and his son Titus, who ruled from 79 to 81. The two were subjects of many narratives at the time, and a play about them would not have been unusual. Dover Wilson further argues that the theory that Titus and Vespasian is Titus Andronicus probably originated in an 1865 English translation of a 1620 German translation of Titus, in which Lucius had been renamed Vespasian.\nAlthough it is known that the play was definitely popular in its day, there is no other recorded performance for many years. In January 1668, it was listed by the Lord Chamberlain as one of twenty-one plays owned by the King's Company which had, at some stage previously, been acted at Blackfriars Theatre; \"A Catalogue of part of his Mates Servants Playes as they were formally acted at the Blackfryers & now allowed of to his Mates Servants at ye New Theatre.\" However, no other information is provided. During the late seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, adaptations of the play came to dominate the stage, and after the Burley performance in 1596 and the possible Blackfriars performance some time prior to 1667, there is no definite recorded performance of the Shakespearean text in England until the early twentieth century.\nAfter over 300 years absence from the English stage, the play returned on 8 October 1923, in a production directed by Robert Atkins at The Old Vic, as part of the Vic's presentation of the complete dramatic works over a seven-year period. The production featured Wilfred Walter as Titus, Florence Saunders as Tamora, George Hayes as Aaron and Jane Bacon as Lavinia. Reviews at the time praised Hayes' performance but criticised Walter's as monotonous. Atkins staged the play with a strong sense of Elizabethan theatrical authenticity, with a plain black backdrop, and a minimum of props. Critically, the production met with mixed reviews, some welcoming the return of the original play to the stage, some questioning why Atkins had bothered when various adaptations were much better and still extant. Nevertheless, the play was a huge box office success, one of the most successful in the Complete Works presentation.The earliest known performance of the Shakespearean text in the United States was in April 1924 when the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity of Yale University staged the play under the direction of John M. Berdan and E. M. Woolley as part of a double bill with Robert Greene's Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay. While some material was removed from 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, the rest of the play was left intact, with much attention devoted to the violence and gore. The cast list for this production has been lost.The best known and most successful production of the play in England was directed by Peter Brook for the RSC at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1955, starring Laurence Olivier as Titus, Maxine Audley as Tamora, Anthony Quayle as Aaron and Vivien Leigh as Lavinia. Brook had been offered the chance to direct Macbeth but had controversially turned it down, and instead decided to stage Titus. The media predicted that the production would be a massive failure, and possibly spell the end of Brook's career, but on the contrary, it was a huge commercial and critical success, with many of the reviews arguing that Brook's alterations improved Shakespeare's script (Marcus' lengthy speech upon discovering Lavinia was removed and some of the scenes in Act 4 were reorganised). Olivier in particular was singled out for his performance and for making Titus a truly sympathetic character. J. C. Trewin for example, wrote \"the actor had thought himself into the hell of Titus; we forgot the inadequacy of the words in the spell of the projection.\" The production is also noted for muting the violence: Chiron and Demetrius were killed off stage; the heads of Quintus and Martius were never seen; the nurse is strangled, not stabbed; Titus' hand was never seen; blood and wounds were symbolised by red ribbons. Edward Trostle Jones summed up the style of the production as employing \"stylised distancing effects\". The scene where Lavinia first appears after the rape was singled out by critics as being especially horrific, with her wounds portrayed by red streamers hanging from her wrists and mouth. Some reviewers however, found the production too beautified, making it unrealistic, with several commenting on the cleanness of Lavinia's face after her tongue has supposedly been cut out. After its hugely successful Royal Shakespeare Theatre run, the play went on tour around Europe in 1957. No video recordings of the production are known, although there are many photographs available.The success of the Brook production seems to have provided an impetus for directors to tackle the play, and ever since 1955, there has been a steady stream of performances on the English and American stages. After Brook, the next major production came in 1967, when Douglas Seale directed an extremely graphic and realistic presentation at the Centre Stage in Baltimore with costumes that recalled the various combatants in World War II. Seale's production employed a strong sense of theatrical realism to make parallels between the contemporary period and that of Titus, and thus comment on the universality of violence and revenge. Seale set the play in the 1940s and made pointed parallels with concentration camps, the massacre at Katyn, the Nuremberg Rallies and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Saturninus was based on Benito Mussolini and all his followers dressed entirely in black; Titus was modelled after a Prussian Army officer; the Andronici wore Nazi insignia and the Goths at the end of the play were dressed in Allied Forces uniforms; the murders in the last scene are all carried out by gunfire, and at the end of the play swastikas rained down onto the stage. The play received mixed reviews with many critics wondering why Seale had chosen to associate the Andronici with Nazism, arguing that it created a mixed metaphor.Later in 1967, as a direct reaction to Seale's realistic production, Gerald Freedman directed a performance for Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Festival at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, Manhattan, starring Jack Hollander as Titus, Olympia Dukakis as Tamora, Moses Gunn as Aaron and Erin Martin as Lavinia. Freedman had seen Seale's production and felt it failed because it worked by \"bringing into play our sense of reality in terms of detail and literal time structure\". He argued that when presented realistically, the play simply does not work, as it raises too many practical questions, such as why does Lavinia not bleed to death, why does Marcus not take her to the hospital immediately, why does Tamora not notice that the pie tastes unusual, exactly how do both Martius and Quintus manage to fall into a hole? Freedman argued that \"if one wants to create a fresh emotional response to the violence, blood and multiple mutilations of Titus Andronicus, one must shock the imagination and subconscious with visual images that recall the richness and depth of primitive rituals.\" As such, the costumes were purposely designed to represent no particular time or place but were instead based on those of the Byzantine Empire and feudal Japan. Additionally, the violence was stylised; instead of swords and daggers, wands were used and no contact was ever made. The colour scheme was hallucinatory, changing mid-scene. Characters wore classic masks of comedy and tragedy. The slaughter in the final scene was accomplished symbolically by having each character wrapped in a red robe as they died. A narrator (Charles Dance) was also used, who, prior to each act, would announce what was going to happen in the upcoming act, thus undercutting any sense of realism. The production received generally positive reviews, with Mildred Kuner arguing \"Symbolism rather than gory realism was what made this production so stunning.\"In 1972, Trevor Nunn directed an RSC production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, as part of a presentation of the four Roman plays, starring Colin Blakely as Titus, Margaret Tyzack as Tamora, Calvin Lockhart as Aaron and Janet Suzman as Lavinia. Colin Blakely and John Wood as a vicious and maniacal Saturninus received particularly positive reviews. This production took the realistic approach and did not shirk from the more specific aspects of the violence; for example, Lavinia has trouble walking after the rape, which, it is implied, was anal rape. Nunn believed the play asked profound questions about the sustainability of Elizabethan society, and as such, he linked the play to the contemporary period to ask the same questions of late twentieth-century England; he was \"less concerned with the condition of ancient Rome than with the morality of contemporary life\". In his program notes, Nunn wrote \"Shakespeare's Elizabethan nightmare has become ours.\" He was especially interested in the theory that decadence had led to the collapse of Rome. At the end of 4.2, for example, there was an on-stage orgy, and throughout the play, supporting actors appeared in the backgrounds dancing, eating, drinking and behaving outrageously. Also in this vein, the play opened with a group of people paying homage to a waxwork of an obese emperor reclining on a couch and clutching a bunch of grapes.The play was performed for the first time at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada in 1978, when it was directed by Brian Bedford, starring William Hutt as Titus, Jennifer Phipps as Tamora, Alan Scarfe as Aaron and Domini Blithe as Lavinia. Bedford went with neither stylisation nor realism; instead the violence simply tended to happen off-stage, but everything else was realistically presented. The play received mixed reviews with some praising its restraint and others arguing that the suppression of the violence went too far. Many cited the final scene, where despite three onstage stabbings, not one drop of blood was visible, and the reveal of Lavinia, where she was totally bloodless despite her mutilation. This production cut Lucius' final speech and instead ended with Aaron alone on the stage as Sibyl predicts the fall of Rome in lines written by Bedford himself. As such, \"for affirmation and healing under Lucius the production substituted a sceptical modern theme of evil triumphant and Rome's decadence.\"A celebrated, and unedited production, (according to Jonathan Bate, not a single line from Q1 was cut) was directed by Deborah Warner in 1987 at The Swan and remounted at Barbican's Pit in 1988 for the RSC, starring Brian Cox as Titus, Estelle Kohler as Tamora, Peter Polycarpou as Aaron and Sonia Ritter as Lavinia. Met with almost universally positive reviews, Jonathan Bate regards it as the finest production of any Shakespearean play of the entire 1980s. Using a small cast, Warner had her actors address the audience from time to time throughout the play and often had actors leave the stage and wander out into the auditorium. Opting for a realist presentation, the play had a warning posted in the pit \"This play contains scenes which some people may find disturbing\", and numerous critics noted how, after the interval at many shows, empty seats had appeared in the audience. Warner's production was considered so successful, both critically and commercially, that the RSC did not stage the play again until 2003.In 1988, Mark Rucker directed a realistic production at Shakespeare Santa Cruz, starring J. Kenneth Campbell as Titus, Molly Maycock as Tamora, Elizabeth Atkeson as Lavinia, and an especially well-received performance by Bruce A. Young as Aaron. Campbell presented Titus in a much more sympathetic light than usual; for example, he kills Mutius by accident, pushing him so that he falls against a tree, and his refusal to allow Mutius to be buried was performed as if in a dream state. Prior to the production, Rucker had Young work out and get in shape so that by the time of the performance, he weighed 240 lbs. Standing at six-foot four, his Aaron was purposely designed to be the most physically imposing character on the stage. Additionally, he was often positioned as standing on hills and tables, with the rest of the cast below him. When he appears with the Goths, he is not their prisoner, but willingly enters their camp in pursuit of his baby, the implication being that without this one weakness, he would have been invincible.In 1994, Julie Taymor directed the play at the Theater for the New City. The production featured a prologue and epilogue set in the modern era, foregrounded the character of Young Lucius, who acts as a kind of choric observer of events, and starred Robert Stattel as Titus, Melinda Mullins as Tamora, Harry Lennix as Aaron and Miriam Healy-Louie as Lavinia. Heavily inspired in her design by Joel-Peter Witkin, Taymor used stone columns to represent the people of Rome, who she saw as silent and incapable of expressing any individuality or subjectivity. Controversially, the play ended with the implication that Lucius had killed Aaron's baby, despite his vow not to.\nIn 1995, Gregory Doran directed a production at the Royal National Theatre, which also played at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg, South Africa, starring Antony Sher as Titus, Dorothy Ann Gould as Tamora, Sello Maake as Aaron and Jennifer Woodbine as Lavinia. Although Doran explicitly denied any political overtones, the play was set in a modern African context and made explicit parallels to South African politics. In his production notes, which Doran co-wrote with Sher, he stated, \"Surely, to be relevant, theatre must have an umbilical connection to the lives of the people watching it.\" One particularly controversial decision was to have the play spoken in indigenous accents rather than Received Pronunciation, which allegedly resulted in many white South Africans refusing to see the play. Writing in Plays International in August 1995, Robert Lloyd Parry argued \"the questions raised by Titus went far beyond the play itself [to] many of the tensions that exist in the new South Africa; the gulf of mistrust that still exists between blacks and whites ... Titus Andronicus has proved itself to be political theatre in the truest sense.\"For the first time since 1987, the RSC staged the play in 2003, under the direction of Bill Alexander and starring David Bradley as Titus, Maureen Beattie as Tamora, Joe Dixon as Aron and Eve Myles as Lavinia. Convinced that Act 1 was by George Peele, Alexander felt he was not undermining the integrity of Shakespeare by drastically altering it; for example, Saturninus and Tamora are present throughout, they never leave the stage; there is no division between the upper and lower levels; all mention of Mutius is absent; and over 100 lines were removed.\nIn 2006, two major productions were staged within a few weeks of one another. The first opened on 29 May at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by Lucy Bailey and starring Douglas Hodge as Titus, Geraldine Alexander as Tamora, Shaun Parkes as Aaron and Laura Rees as Lavinia. Bailey focused on a realistic presentation throughout the production; for example, after her mutilation, Lavinia is covered from head to toe in blood, with her stumps crudely bandaged, and raw flesh visible beneath. So graphic was Bailey's use of realism that at several productions, audience members fainted upon Lavinia's appearance. The production was also controversial insofar as the Globe had a roof installed for the first time in its history. The decision was taken by designer William Dudley, who took as his inspiration a feature of the Colosseum known as a velarium \u2013 a cooling system which consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the centre. Dudley made it as a PVC awning which was intended to darken the auditorium.\nThe second 2006 production opened at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre on 9 June as part of the Complete Works Festival. Directed by Yukio Ninagawa, it starred Kotaro Yoshida as Titus, Rei Asami as Tamora, Shun Oguri as Aaron and Hitomi Manaka as Lavinia. Performed in Japanese, the original English text was projected as surtitles onto the back of the stage. In stark contrast to Bailey's production, theatricality was emphasised; the play begins with the company still rehearsing and getting into costume and the stage hands still putting the sets together. The production followed the 1955 Brook production in its depiction of violence; actress Hitomi Manaka appeared after the rape scene with stylised red ribbons coming from her mouth and arms, substituting for blood. Throughout the play, at the back of the stage, a huge marble wolf can be seen from which feed Romulus and Remus, with the implication being that Rome is a society based on animalistic origins. The play ends with Young Lucius holding Aaron's baby out to the audience and crying out \"The horror! The horror!\"Several reviews of the time made much of the manner in which each production approached the appearance of Lavinia after the rape: \"At Shakespeare's Globe, the groundlings are fainting at the mutilations in Lucy Bailey's coarse but convincing production. To Stratford-upon-Avon, Yukio Ninagawa brings a Japanese staging so stylised that it keeps turning the horror into visual poetry.\" Speaking of Bailey's production, Eleanor Collins of Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, said of the scene, \"audience members turned their heads away in real distress\". Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph called Lavinia \"almost too ghastly to behold\". Michael Billington of The Guardian said her slow shuffle onto the stage \"chills the blood\". Sam Marlowe of The Times saw Bailey's use of realism as extremely important for the moral of the production as a whole: \"violated, her hands and her tongue cruelly cut away, she stumbles into view drenched in blood, flesh dangling from her hacked wrists, moaning and keening, almost animalistic. It's the production's most powerful symbolic image, redolent of the dehumanising effects of war.\" Of Ninagawa's production, some critics felt the use of stylisation damaged the impact of the scene. Benedict Nightingale of The Times, for example, asked \"is it enough to suggest bloodletting by having red ribbons flow from wrists and throats?\" Similarly, The Guardian's Michael Billington, who had praised Bailey's use of realistic effects, wrote \"At times I felt that Ninagawa, through stylised images and Handelian music, unduly aestheticised violence.\" Some critics, however, felt the stylisation was more powerful than Bailey's realism; Neil Allan and Scott Revers of Cahiers \u00c9lisab\u00e9thains, for example, wrote \"Blood itself was denoted by spools of red thread spilling from garments, limbs and Lavinia's mouth. Cruelty was stylised; the visceral became the aesthetic.\" Similarly, Paul Taylor, writing for The Independent, wrote \"Gore is represented by swatches of red cords that tumble and trail from wounded wrists and mouths. You might think that this method had a cushioning effect. In fact it concentrates and heightens the horror.\" Ninagawa himself said \"The violence is all there. I am just trying to express these things in a different way from any previous production.\" In her 2013 essay, \"Mythological Reconfigurations on the Contemporary Stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus\", which directly compares the depictions of the two Lavinias, Agn\u00e8s Lafont writes of Ninagawa's production that Lavinia's appearance functions as a \"visual emblem\": \"Bloodshed and beauty create a stark dissonance ... Distancing itself from the violence it stages thanks to 'dissonance', the production presents Lavinia onstage as if she were a painting ... Ninagawa's work distances itself from cruelty, as the spectacle of suffering is stylised. Ribbons that represent blood ... are symbolic means of filtering the aching spectacle of an abused daughter, and yet the spectacle retains its shocking potential and its power of empathy all the while intellectualizing it.\"In 2007, Gale Edwards directed a production for the Shakespeare Theatre Company at the Harman Center for the Arts, starring Sam Tsoutsouvas as Titus, Valerie Leonard as Tamora, Colleen Delany as Lavinia, and Peter Macon as Aaron. Set in an unspecific modern milieu, props were kept to a minimum, with lighting and general staging kept simple, as Edwards wanted the audience to concentrate on the story, not the staging. The production received generally very favourable reviews.In 2011, Michael Sexton directed a modern military dress production at The Public Theater on a minimalistic set made of plywood boards. The production had a low budget and much of it was spent on huge volumes of blood that literally drenched the actors in the final scene, as Sexton said he was determined to outdo his contemporaries in terms of the amount of on-stage blood in the play. The production starred Jay O. Sanders (who was nominated for a Lucille Lortel) as Titus, Stephanie Roth Haberle as Tamora, Ron Cephas Jones as Aaron and Jennifer Ikeda as Lavinia.In 2013, Michael Fentiman directed the play for the Royal Shakespeare Company, with Stephen Boxer as Titus, Katy Stephens as Tamora, Kevin Harvey as Aaron, and Rose Reynolds as Lavinia. Emphasising the gore and violence, the production carried a trailer with warnings of \"graphic imagery and scenes of butchery\". It played at The Swan until October 2013. Also in 2013, the Hudson Shakespeare Company staged a production directed by Jon Ciccarelli as part of a special Halloween festival for the Historic Jersey City and Harsimus Cemetery. The production contrasted a military and modern Goth culture, but quickly disintegrated into an anarchic state, stressing the black comedy of the play.Outside Britain and the United States, other significant productions include Qiping Xu's 1986 production in China, which drew political parallels to Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards; Peter Stein's 1989 production in Italy which evoked images of twentieth century Fascism; Daniel Mesguich's 1989 production in Paris, which set the entire play in a crumbling library, acting as a symbol for Roman civilisation; Nenni Delmestre's 1992 production in Zagreb which acted as a metaphor for the struggles of the Croatian people; and Silviu Purc\u0103rete's 1992 Romanian production, which explicitly avoided using the play as a metaphor for the fall of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu (this production is one of the most successful plays ever staged in Romania, and it was revived every year up to 1997).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Following Blake's graduation, Gilchrist inherited the starting point guard position as a sophomore, leading the team in assists (5.0 pg), scoring (15.4 pg), minutes (34.0 pg), and steals (1.8 pg), while starting 30 of 32 games. For his efforts, Gilchrist was named the Terps' Co-Player of the Year.\nHowever, Gilchrist's true coming-out party would be the 2004 ACC Tournament. Having slipped to 7\u20139 in the ACC\u2014the team's first sub-.500 conference record in more than a decade\u2014Maryland was not as highly regarded as in years past and wound up as the tournament's 6th seed. However, the Terps ultimately upset the tournament's top three seeds, knocking off Wake Forest (3), NC State (2), and Duke (1), to win their first ACC Tournament title in 20 years.\nDuring this run, Gilchrist dazzled as the Terps' primary offensive option. First, Gilchrist hit the game-winning free throw against a Chris Paul-led Wake Forest team, scoring 16 points and shooting 4-for-4 from 3-point range. Next, Gilchrist led a 21-point comeback against the NC State Wolfpack, scoring 23 of his 30 points after halftime (and shooting 9-for-9 from the field); the 30-point performance was the first for a Terp since Juan Dixon scored 33 points against the Kansas Jayhawks in the 2002 NCAA Final Four.\nBut Gilchrist was saving his best for last. In the tournament final against Duke\u2014a team bound for the 2004 Final Four and loaded with six future NBA players\u2014Gilchrist led the Terps back from a 12-point deficit with less than five minutes left in the game. Most dramatically, Gilchrist closed the 2nd half with a driving layup that drew a fifth and final foul on Shelden Williams, Duke's best low-post presence and Gilchrist's main competition for tournament MVP. Gilchrist's ensuing foul shot would tie the game at 77 with 20 seconds left, and Maryland went on to dominate the overtime and secure a 95\u201387 victory. For his three-day heroics, Gilchrist was unanimously named tournament MVP. The win also snapped Duke's drive for a sixth consecutive ACC Tournament title, while propelling Maryland into the 2004 NCAA tournament; though the Terps ultimately lost by a few points to Syracuse in the second round, the team was seen as an up-and-coming squad that had overachieved, despite its youth.\nHowever, Gilchrist's career at Maryland\u2014and fans' and NBA scouts' glowing opinion of him\u2014would never reach these heights again. Led by their junior point guard, the Terps entered the 2004\u20132005 season ranked in the top 15 in the nation, but would succumb to road struggles and a late season collapse to again finish 7\u20139 in the conference. Nor could the team summon 2004's magic in the 2005 ACC Tournament; the Terps lost in the first round to Clemson, the third time the Tigers defeated the Terps that year. With a middling 16\u201312 record, Maryland missed the NCAA tournament for the first time in 13 years and accepted a consolation trip to the NIT, where they lost in the semifinals to South Carolina.", "hasanswer": false}]}
