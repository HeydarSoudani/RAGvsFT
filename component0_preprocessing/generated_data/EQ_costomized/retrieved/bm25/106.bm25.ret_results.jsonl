{"id": "106_1", "question": "What kind of work does Epicurus do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_36447", "text": "Epicurus (, EH-pih-KURE-\u0259s; Greek: \u1f18\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 Epikouros; 341\u2013270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and sage who founded Epicureanism, a highly influential school of philosophy. He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as \"the Garden\", in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects. He openly allowed women and slaves to join the school as a matter of policy. Of the over 300 works said to have been written by Epicurus about various subjects, the vast majority have been destroyed. Only three letters written by him\u2014the letters to Menoeceus, Pythocles, and Herodotus\u2014and two collections of quotes\u2014the Principal Doctrines and the Vatican Sayings\u2014have survived intact, along with a few fragments of his other writings. As a result of his work's destruction, most knowledge about his philosophy is due to later authors, particularly the biographer Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, the Epicurean Roman poet Lucretius and the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus, as well as the hostile but largely accurate accounts by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and the Academic Skeptic and statesman Cicero.\nEpicurus asserted that philosophy's purpose is to attain as well as to help others attain happy (eudaimonic), tranquil lives characterized by ataraxia (peace and freedom from fear) and aponia (the absence of pain). He advocated that people were best able to pursue philosophy by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that the root of all human neuroses is denial of death and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. According to Epicurus, death is the end of both the body and the soul and therefore should not be feared. Epicurus taught that although the gods exist, they have no involvement in human affairs. He taught that people should act ethically not because the gods punish or reward them for their actions but because, due to the power of guilt, amoral behavior would inevitably lead to remorse weighing on their consciences and as a result, they would be prevented from attaining ataraxia. \nEpicurus derived much of his physics and cosmology from the earlier philosopher Democritus (c. 460\u2013c. 370 BC). Like Democritus, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal and that all matter is made up of extremely tiny, invisible particles known as atoms. All occurrences in the natural world are ultimately the result of atoms moving and interacting in empty space. Epicurus deviated from Democritus by proposing the idea of atomic \"swerve\", which holds that atoms may deviate from their expected course, thus permitting humans to possess free will in an otherwise deterministic universe.\nThough popular, Epicurean teachings were controversial from the beginning. Epicureanism reached the height of its popularity during the late years of the Roman Republic. It died out in late antiquity, subject to hostility from early Christianity. Throughout the Middle Ages Epicurus was popularly, though inaccurately, remembered as a patron of drunkards, whoremongers, and gluttons. His teachings gradually became more widely known in the fifteenth century with the rediscovery of important texts, but his ideas did not become acceptable until the seventeenth century, when the French Catholic priest Pierre Gassendi revived a modified version of them, which was promoted by other writers, including Walter Charleton and Robert Boyle. His influence grew considerably during and after the Enlightenment, profoundly impacting the ideas of major thinkers, including John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Jeremy Bentham, and Karl Marx.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He was hired, moved to Portland, and began working for The Oregonian on February 1, 1916.  For his first 14 months at the paper, he covered police-related news, but also wrote editorials from time to time. In 1920, he published an account of the 1919 Centralia Massacre.  In additional to part-time editorial writing, he worked as a reporter and feature writer for The Oregonian until 1922, when the paper made him a full-time editorial writer and an associate editor. He also wrote nature essays in The Oregonian.His stories and essays also appeared in national magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post. Some of his essays about life in Portland were collected in his 1942 book At the End of the Car Line. In 1943 he won an O.

During that period, there was a strong market for high quality illustrated books which typically were given as Christmas gifts. Many of Rackham's books were produced in a de luxe limited edition, often vellum bound and usually signed, as well as a smaller, less ornately bound quarto 'trade' edition. This was sometimes followed by a more modestly presented octavo edition in subsequent years for particularly popular books. The onset of the war in 1914 curtailed the market for such quality books, and the public's taste for fantasy and fairies also declined in the 1920s.\nSutherland, referring to Rackham's work in the 20th century, states: \"Rackham was, without doubt, one of the finest illustrators of the century.\" In his survey of British Book Illustration, Salaman stated: \"Mr. Rackham stands apart from all the other illustrators of the day; his genius is so thoroughly original. Scores of others have depicted fairyland and wonderland, but who else has given us so absolutely individual and persuasively suggestive a vision of their marvels and allurements? Whose elves are so elfish, whose witches and gnomes are so convincingly of their kind, as Mr. Rackham's?\"Carpenter and Prichard noted that \"For all the virtuosity of his work in colour, Rackham remained an artist in line, his mastery having its roots in his early work for periodicals, then breaking free to create the swirling intricate pictures of his prime, and finally reaching the economy and impressionism of his last work.\" They also remarked on his decline: \"Rackham made his name in a heyday of fairy literature and other fantasy which the First World War brought to an end.\" House stated that Rackham \"concentrated on the illustration of books and particularly those of a mystical, magic or legendary background. He very soon established himself as one of the foremost Edwardian illustrators and was triumphant in the early 1900s when colour printing first enabled him to use subtle tints and muted tones to represent age and timelessness. Rackham's imaginative eye saw all forms with the eyes of childhood and created a world that was half reassuring and half frightening.\"Hamilton summarised his article on Rackham in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography thus: \"Rackham brought a renewed sense of excitement to book illustration that coincided with the rapid developments in printing technology in the early twentieth century. Working with subtle colour and wiry line, he exploited the growing strengths of commercial printing to create imagery and characterizations that reinvigorated children's literature, electrified young readers, and dominated the art of book illustration at the start of a new century.\"Arthur Rackham's works have become very popular since his death, both in North America and Britain. His images have been widely used by the greeting card industry and many of his books are still in print or have been recently available in both paperback and hardback editions.

Born in Kilkenny, Ireland, O'Reily studied for the priesthood in Dublin.  Upon his ordination in 1869, he migrated to Western Australia, serving as a parish priest in Fremantle, and founding a Catholic newspaper there.  When the Diocese of Port Augusta was established in 1887, Pope Leo XIII named O'Reily as its first bishop.  Concerned about the financial position of the diocese (which had inherited significant debt from the Diocese of Adelaide), he accepted the posting reluctantly.  As bishop, he greatly improved the financial position of the new diocese, reducing its debt by half and earning a reputation as a competent administrator.\nIn 1894, O'Reily was appointed to replace the deceased Christopher Reynolds as Archbishop of Adelaide.  The archdiocese he inherited was burdened with substantial debt, again left over from the old Diocese of Adelaide. Through the sale of church assets and a fundraising campaign, O'Reily was able to eliminate most of the Archdiocese's liabilities while still investing in church infrastructure.  He also actively participated in public discussions relating to education policy at a time when the role of the state in supporting religious education was topical.  O'Reily publicly advocated government assistance for religious schools, stating that it was unfair Catholics paid taxes to support state schools, but received no funding for their own.  In the later years of his life, poor health forced him to spend less time attending to his episcopal duties, and from 1905, he largely retreated from public life.  At his request, Robert Spence was appointed as his coadjutor and successor in 1914, and on 6 July 1915, he died at his house in Adelaide.

Such people are not powerful in the sense they have resources that they could use that other groups do not (though they might have this power as well) but rather systematically lucky in that they tend to get what they want without having to do anything. Alternatively, other groups are systematically unlucky. This argument has caused great controversy with critics including Brian Barry, Steven Lukes, Peter Morriss and more recently Andrew Hindmoor.Dowding has also worked on the Tiebout model of individuals moving location to get the local services they require, showing that such moving does occur in the UK though only to a small extent, and that people tend to move to areas for service reasons, but do not decide to leave from areas for those reasons. He has extended this work into examining Albert Hirschman's Exit, Voice and Loyalty Model and has a forthcoming Cambridge University Press book Exits, Voices and Social Investment co-authored with long-time collaborator Peter John extending and applying Hirschman's model to citizen satisfaction with government services.\nDowding also considered the theory of presidentialisation of British politics in his 2012 article, \u201cThe Prime Ministerialization of the British Prime Minister\u201d. The article challenges Michael Foley\u2019s theory that British politics is becoming increasingly similar to that of a presidential system. Dowding instead suggests that the British prime minister is gaining power, but only enhancing the responsibilities that he already possesses rather than adopting new powers that are more closely attributed to the United States\u2019 President.\nMore recently his work has examined why UK cabinet ministers resign based on a large dataset of all UK ministerial resignations and non-resignations, and compiled another on Australia. He is now working on a major project examining political careers in Australia.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They would eventually split in 1989. He subsequently embarked on a successful career as a solo artist.\nFollowing a short stint recording demos with Jake Burns and Dolphin Taylor, previously of Irish punk outfit Stiff Little Fingers, Foxton released his debut single \"Freak\" on Arista Records. Entering the UK Singles Chart at No. 34 on 30 July 1983, it eventually peaked at No. 23 and secured an appearance on Top of the Pops. Foxton's solo album Touch Sensitive followed in 1984, but subsequent singles \"This Is the Way\", \"It Makes Me Wonder\" and \"My Imagination (S.O.S.)\" failed to enter the Top 40. A final single \"Play This Game to Win\" was released on Harvest Records in November 1986.Foxton went on to replace Ali McMordie in a reformed Stiff Little Fingers in 1990, remaining with the band until January 2006, when he quit to pursue other projects. Later that year he joined Simon Townshend (Pete Townshend's brother), and Mark Brzezicki and Bruce Watson (both of Big Country) in the band Casbah Club, which released an album called Venustraphobia.\nAfter the Jam split, Buckler formed Time UK with Jimmy Edwards and Ray Simone, formerly of Masterswitch, ex-Tom Robinson Band guitarist Danny Kustow and (briefly) former Radio Stars/Sparks bassist Martin Gordon. The band released three singles \"The Cabaret\", \"Playground of Privilege\" and \"You Won't Stop\" before folding. In 1986, Buckler and Foxton released the single \"Entertain Me\" under the name Sharp.\nIn 2006, Buckler, who had not been playing for several years after Sharp quit, formed a band named the Gift, playing material from the Jam with musicians Russell Hastings and David Moore. Hastings, who spent many years as a local musician including a couple of years in a Jam tribute band, took on guitar and lead vocal duties. In 2006, Foxton performed on stage with The Gift at some of their concerts, and went on to join the band as bassist, with Moore moving to second guitar and keyboards. At this point the group changed its name to From the Jam. In a 2007 press release, Foxton and Buckler announced they were working on a new album and UK tour, which led to press speculation about a full or partial reunion of the Jam, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of In the City. Weller did not take part, and has publicly expressed his lack of interest in any type of reformation. In a 2006 interview with BBC Radio 6 Music, Weller stated a reunion of the Jam would \"never, ever happen\", and that reformations are \"sad\". He said: \"Me and my children would have to be destitute and starving in the gutter before I'd even consider that, and I don't think that'll happen anyway ... The Jam's music still means something to people and a lot of that's because we stopped at the right time, it didn't go on and become embarrassing.\"After the Jam split, Weller and Foxton reportedly did not speak to one another for 20 years. In June 2006, it was reported that Weller and Foxton met backstage at The Who's Hyde Park concert, and a ten-minute conversation ended with an embrace. Foxton claimed that the two became friends again in 2009 and this led to them collaborating for two tracks on Weller's solo album Wake Up the Nation in early 2010. In May 2010, Weller and Foxton appeared together on stage for the first time in 28 years at The Albert Hall in London, performing three songs together.

{"id": "106_42", "question": "What kind of work does Joe Comartin do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_36570", "text": "Having grown up without a father and being especially aware of the strain that put on a family, Comartin had delayed any political aspirations until after his children were grown. Comartin ran for MP in his home riding of Windsor\u2014St. Clair in the 1997 Canadian federal election. Comartin campaigned on job creation and expanding healthcare coverage against Liberal incumbent Shaughnessy Cohen, who was considered vulnerable after a personal finance scandal in which she defaulted on her debt. Other notable candidates included Mayor of Tecumseh Harold Downs and national party treasurer Bruck Easton for the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties respectively. Despite the scandal and frequent appearances on his behalf by Leader of the NDP Alexa McDonough, Comartin was defeated, placing second to Cohen. The 1997 election was also marred by personal tragedy; Comartin's mother died in the first week of the campaign, with her second husband having predeceased her seven years earlier, and in the week following the campaign, Comartin's youngest son Adam was in a motorcycle accident which left his right arm permanently paralyzed.After Cohen's sudden death in office, Comartin ran in the 1999 by-election to replace her. Comartin's main opponent was city councillor Rick Limoges, who defeated Cohen's widower, Jerry Cohen, for the Liberal nomination. While the by-election was mainly considered a competition between Comartin and Limoges, Bruck Easton was once again fielded as the candidate of the Progressive Conservatives, while Reform nominated mortgage broker and former magician Scott Cowan. Comartin's campaign manager Joe MacDonald was assigned to him by the NDP. MacDonald was a well-known party insider and campaign manager. Comartin ultimately lost by less than one hundred votes to Limoges in what was initially expected to be a Liberal landslide. Besides a general decline in Liberal popularity, it was speculated that the closeness of the race was in part because of high ticket sales in Windsor for an anticipated Detroit Tigers game happening on the same day. The game may have deflated voter turnout to the detriment of Limoges. Comartin later claimed that MacDonald had not believed that he had a chance of winning and had not worked as hard as he could have because of it. MacDonald denied the allegation, and charged that the problems with the campaign were because of interference by Comartin's family.Comartin challenged Limoges again the next year with environmental protection as his main issue. The rematch was very similar to the previous year, with it being mainly considered a competition between Comartin and Limoges, and with Bruck Easton appearing yet again as the Progressive Conservative candidate. Since the by-election, the Reform Party had rebranded as the Canadian Alliance in anticipation of a merger with the Progressive Conservatives. The Alliance nominated autoworker Phil Pettinato as their candidate. In their second bout, Comartin narrowly defeated Limoges. Besides the strong support expected from progressives and union members, Comartin also benefitted from conservatives who strategically voted for him in the hopes of harming the ruling Liberals. Comartin's victory was attributed to the conservative strategic vote.Through his victory, Comartin became the first New Democrat to be elected in Ontario in ten years, and the first New Democrat to represent an Ontario riding in seven; Michael Breaugh had won a by-election in Oshawa in 1990, but had been defeated with the NDP's nine other Ontario MPs in the 1993 Canadian federal election. Shortly after being elected, Comartin was appointed as his party's critic for the environment.Following the September 11 attacks, Comartin caused controversy by opposing direct military intervention to assist the United States in its invasion of Afghanistan. He did, however, support greatly expanding the Canadian military budget in order to properly meet pre-existing commitments.In 2002, Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray of Windsor West was removed in a cabinet shuffle by Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Instead of serving out the rest of his term, Gray decided to resign from parliament to become Canadian Chair of the International Joint Commission. In the ensuing by-election, Comartin supported the campaign of city councillor Brian Masse, who went on to win Gray's old seat. Masse became the NDP caucus' second Ontario MP after Comartin, and the NDP would go on to control both of Windsor's federal ridings for the next seventeen years. Comartin and Masse had a close working relationship, and were nicknamed \"The Twindsors.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "106_53", "question": "What kind of work does Erik Charell do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_36601", "text": "Charell was born as Erich Karl L\u00f6wenberg in Breslau. He was the first child of Jewish parents Markus L\u00f6wenberg and Ida Korach. He also had a sister, Betti, who was born in 1886, and a younger brother named Ludwig, who was born in 1889 and later became Charell's manager.\nCharell studied dance in Berlin. He was discovered, according to his own account, by the press in 1913 during a performance of the ballet-pantomime Venezianische Abenteuer eines jungen Mannes by playwright Karl Vollm\u00f6ller in a production of director Max Reinhardt at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. He founded his own company, the Charell-Ballett, and toured Europe during and after the World War I. The musical director of his company was the young Friedrich Hollaender (later a famous film composer.) In two silent movies, Paul Leni's Prince Cuckoo (1919) and Richard Oswald's Figures of the Night (1920) he demonstrated his brilliance as an actor. Reinhardt appointed Charell as assistant stage manager for the tour production of Vollm\u00f6ller's The Miracle in New York in 1923. After his return to Germany in 1924, Charell and his brother Ludwig were offered to take over the management of the Gro\u00dfes Schauspielhaus in Berlin, which belonged to Reinhardt's theatre empire, the so called Reinhardt B\u00fchnen.\nIn 1924 Charell presented his first revue, An Alle. He managed to engage the \"Tiller Girls\", an internationally famous girl group from London. His aim was to mix German operetta with exotic ingredients such as jazz, \"negro music\" and \"the most enchanting Dancing-Girls with divine legs\", in order to show that revue made in Berlin could be \"as contemporary as the jazz band, that turns the Siegmund-jodeling and Siegfried-screaching to laughter\" and is \"as modern as Mozart or the mini-automobile\", as Charell's personal friend and PR genius Alfred Flechtheim phrased it in the 1924 article \"Vom Ballet zur Revue\" in the magazine Der Querschnitt. \"Charell wants us to witness the many different facets from all around the world\".This show was followed by the revues F\u00fcr Dich (1925) and Von Mund zu Mund (1926), which were arranged by composer Ralph Benatzky and contained music by Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern and many others.\nAfter the series of revues, Charell began adapting classic operettas such as The Mikado, Wie einst im Mai, Madame Pompadour and Die lustige Witwe and turned them into modern jazzy revue operettas, claiming that he needed a plot line for his show, that had been missing in the pure revues before. A few years later, he decided to create his very own operettas with composer Ralph Benatzky. Together they wrote the trilogy of historical revue-operettas, which made Charell famous to this day: Casanova (1928), Die drei Musketiere (1929) and The White Horse Inn (Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6\u00dfl, 1930). Especially The White Horse Inn was one of the most successful creations of Charell's career. In the following years he himself staged the show in London (1931), Paris (1932) and New York (1936), where each production was newly conceived, the script translated differently, and new music and instrumentation were added in some parts.\nMany actors and singers, such as Marlene Dietrich, Joseph Schmidt, Max Hansen and Camilla Spira, who all became famous later, first appeared in major roles in Charell productions. Charell also discovered the boy group Comedian Harmonists and presented them for the first time in Casanova at the Gro\u00dfe Schauspielhaus. The reaction of the international press was positive, the New York Times noting that \"Erik Charell seems to have done it again. 'Casanova', his latest operetta production at the Grosses Schauspielhaus, is filling this huge circus to its stylized rafters\". \nAfter this string of stage successes, Charell moved on to the new and innovative genre of sound film operetta. In 1931, Universum Film AG (Ufa) producer Erich Pommer invited Charell to direct Der Kongre\u00df tanzt, (sets by Ernst Stern, music by Werner Richard Heymann), one of the most successful films of the early era of sound film, with one review in the New York Times saying that \"[it] is a stupendous pictorial film. [...] it is [...] an exceptional film entertainment. The director, Erik Charell, is the Ziegfeld of the German musical comedy stage\" and another noting that \"It is a charming spectacle of Vienna in 1814, filled with tuneful melodies that one likes to remember and blessed with pleasing light comedy\". The international success of Der Kongre\u00df tanzt led to an engagement in Hollywood, where Charell directed the movie Caravan, again with sets by Ernst Stern and music by Werner Richard Heymann.\nWhen the Nazis took over in January 1933, the Ufa immediately annulled their contract with Charell because of his Jewish descent. They also cancelled all plans for two further contractually agreed upon film projects, one a film operetta based on the Odyssey with Hans Albers in the male lead. Three years later a German court even sentenced Charell to return the 26.000 Reichsmark, which had been paid to him as an advance.\nWhen Caravan flopped in the US and internationally, his Hollywood career and all other American film projects came to an immediate halt. The New York Times noted \"If lyric loveliness and photographic charm were all a picture needed to keep an audience enthralled, Mr. Charell could be toasted in good tokay this morning, and 'Caravan' could be applauded until the bottle is dry. But the sober fact is that the new film is an exceptionally tedious enterprise\". One of the cancelled projects was a film about ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). It would have been an interesting project, since Charell in his dancing days was often compared by the German press to Nijinsky.\nIn 1936, Charell staged a successful Broadway production of White Horse Inn. The New York Times noted that it \"involves mountain scenery and hotel architecture, costumes beautiful and varied enough to bankrupt a designer's imagination, choruses that can do anything from the hornpipe to a resounding slap-dance, grand processionals with royalty loitering before the commoners, a steamboat, a yacht, a char-\u00e0-banc, four real cows and a great deal more of the same. Indeed, the enthusiasm with which 'White Horse Inn' has been created has virtually transformed the enormous Center Theatre into a Tyrol village\". The Daily Mirror mentioned that \"it is difficult to give you an idea of the immensity of 'White Horse Inn'. It is gargantuan. It is the Queen Mary of extravaganzas. [...] It boasts acres of settings, hundreds of performers. It is a grand and glittering sight for the eyes.\" There was even talk of a film version with Eddie Cantor as the head waiter. (Warner Brothers were co-producers of the Broadway staging.)\nSpurred by the success of White Horse Inn, Charell adapted Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream as a jazz operetta and presented it as Swinging the Dream on Broadway at the Center Theatre in 1939. It was a daring and innovative production, because Charell used only black actors and singers, including Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Maxine Sullivan, Moms Mabley, Dorothy Dandridge and Butterfly McQueen. Furthermore, the stage sets were based on Walt Disney motifs. Music was written for the production by Jimmy van Heusen but songs included in the show came from the greatest African-American composers and songwriters in jazz: W. C. Handy, Thomas \"Fats\" Waller, Count Basie and many others.Benny Goodman conducted his own sextet and the choreography was by Agnes de Mille. But the production closed after only 13 performances, mainly because white Broadway audiences (and, perhaps more importantly, racist reviewers) of the time were not \"ready\" for an all-black cast. A review in the New York Times described the show as a \"negro carnival\", noting that \"between Shakespeare and Goodman, Goodman wins\".  It's likely that the timing of the opening had a great deal to do with the lack of success of \"Swingin'\"; by opening night - 29 November 1939 - World War II was in full swing; it would have been difficult for audiences to enjoy an escapist musical fantasy while events in Europe were becoming more and more horrifying with every passing hour.  [A re-creation of the show was streamed online during the COVID-19 pandemic in a collaboration between the Royal Shakespeare Company and Young Vic of London, England and Theatre for a New Audience of New York, New York on 9 January 2021.]\nAfter the war, Charell returned to Europe. In Munich he had a big success with the musical comedy Feuerwerk (music by Paul Burkhard) at the Staatstheater am G\u00e4rtnerplatz. The song O mein Papa became an international hit. In the 1950s, Charell created a stage version of Der Kongre\u00df tanzt, which was performed in France, but the French public was not enthusiastic. His two big film productions were The White Horse Inn with Nazi operetta star Johannes Heesters in 1952, and Fireworks with Lilli Palmer and the young Romy Schneider in 1954.\nAfter failing to write a sequel to The White Horse Inn with his original librettist Robert Gilbert, Charell spend most of his time of the 1960s buying and selling art. Together with his brother Ludwig he owned a collection of Toulouse-Lautrec-lithographs, which was exhibited in Canada in 1953 and in other major museums of the world.\nIn 1969 he received the German movie prize, the Filmband in Gold, for his \"excellent works and outstanding contributions to the history of the German movie\".\nHe died on 15 July 1974 in Munich and was cremated on the Eastern cemetery. In his obituary it says: \"28 friends gave him the last farewell in the city, to which he had a special love. A movie producer spoke to his memories, and to honour this charmer, who consciously and prudently managed his graceful talents, the triumph march of Verdi's opera 'Aida' sounded across the cemetery\". The urn was interred in a cemetery in Gr\u00fcnwald near Munich. Charell's partner Friedrich Zanner and Dr. Wolf Schwarz, a lawyer and friend, were appointed to manage the estate and the personal property.His collection of Lautrec-lithographs was sold by Sotheby's in 1978.\nThe Schwules Museum Berlin dedicated an exhibition to Charell and his work from 7 July to 27 September 2010. It was curated by Kevin Clarke.\nOn 18 November 2015, Friedrichstadt-Palast Berlin inaugurated a memorial at Friedrichstra\u00dfe 107 dedicated to the theatre's founders, Max Reinhardt, Hans Poelzig and Erik Charell.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The sonnet introduces female struggle between coercion and consent to a male lover. Bernadette Andrea's \"Pamphilia's Cabinet: Gendered Authorship and Empire in Lady Mary Wroth's Urania\" addresses the reasons why a female character would confront the reality of choosing between coercion and consent. One of the main aspects that Andrea approaches is the limits that the historical context put on the author's freedom of speech. Andrea states, \"She may write, but only from the limits of her own room; she may preserve her writing, but only within the confines of her own mind\". Sonnet 7 is Pamphilia's expression of her own thoughts, emotions and views.\n\nThe power of the patriarchal society on her views is evident. The influence is exemplified in line 6, \"I am thy subject, conquered, bound to stand\". Voicing her situation, Pamphilia feels subjected to male dominance. However, her desires are unclear on this matter because she says, \"behold I yield\", (5) as if a declaration of her choice to the relations with Amphilanthus. The idea of free choice for women would be classified as a protofeminist thought because they were grossly oppressed and not allowed to think for themselves.\n[The following is a misapplication of Mullaney's ideas; or rather, the writer needs to explain how Wroth's work is akin to the ideological functions of the theater which are the actual subject of Mullaney's work]:  Stephen Mullaney provides insight into the reason that Mary Wroth's work survived by stating, \"What comes to reside in a wonder-cabinet are, in the most reified sense of the phrase, strange things: tokens of alien cultures, reduced to the status of sheer objects, stripped of cultural and human contexts in a way that makes them eminently capable of surviving the period that thus produced them\". The social analysis of the survival of the oppressed writings comes from \"Strange Things, Gross Terms, Curious Customs\". The treatment of women caused Pamphilia to question whether she even has a choice in who she loves (consent) or if that is determined by society (coercion). Her inability to differentiate in the poem is probably due to the subjugation of inferior treatment that she has experienced. Mullaney refers to this as being \"reduced to the status of sheer objects\". She is forced to analyze if she is merely an object at the disposal of men. As a result, her ability to analyze, invoke higher level thinking, and even her personhood is examined.\nWroth's representation of female emotions conjured with the interaction with of a male suitor puts expected women's values into action. The sonnet explores the \"obedience\" attribute of what Bernadette Andrea refers to as the \"triple injunction\" of English culture in the 17th century. The \"triple injunction\" concept was communicated through many different forms including: educational tracts, religious sermons, and legal codes. Its purpose was to define the perfect woman as upholding social norms through the values of chastity, obedience, and silence. Pamphilia ends the sonnet resolving to \"obey\" (14) Amphilanthus' \"charms\", (14) regardless of her own wants. Her conclusion to persevere despite her personal feelings speaks to the cultural understanding of women heroism which is equated with endurance. Pamphilia does not concede all hope of having a choice in the relationship, but does wish to avoid physical hurt.The sonnet does make an intriguing reference to Astrophel and Stella: in line 13 of the Petrarchan sonnet, Wroth writes, \"\u2026Sir God, your boyship I despise\". The phrase \"Sir God\" is linked to the late 16th century poem, Astrophel and Stella. Sidney's Astrophel is referred to as \"Sir Foole\". According to Catherine Bates, Astrophel contracts similar difficulty as he, \"is not only overmastered, the willing victim of a superior power, he is also emasculated\". Perpetuating the gender roles of the time, Bates argues that Sidney paints Astrophel, a boy, as feminine. Wroth includes traces of Astrophel and Stella to provide ties to previous gender inequality. Astrophel only experiences the struggle between coercion, \"overmastered\", and consent, \"willing\", because he is cast as feminine. Bates's understanding of downward mobility in social status by moving from male to female through Sydney's Astrophel and Stella is strongly supported by Bernadette Andrea's analysis of social norms. Wroth's echo of Sydney's work is to address the gender issues from a new voice: the female perspective.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is possible that he was the son of the nephew of the Count of Brittany, however it is much more likely that he came from a family of the name based on the lower Seine valley. William was likely the nephew of Samson de Malveisin, Archbishop of Rheims from 1140 to 1161. In this context, William's career can come as no surprise.\nWilliam appears in Scottish records for the first time in the 1180s, appearing as a royal clerk. In 1193, the royal patronage he had earned brought him his first known ecclesiastical post, as Archdeacon of Lothian. He was made the king's Chancellor probably on 8 September 1199, and was elected to the Bishopric of Glasgow in October the same year. He was consecrated at Lyon by Renaud de Forez, Archbishop of Lyon, in September 1200. However, two years later in the same month, he was translated to the higher ranking Bishopric of St. Andrews. William got into a little trouble for exercising his episcopal powers before his episcopate had been confirmed by the Pope, then Innocent III; a charge was brought against him by one of his canons, a man named Eustace. The charge was heard by the Papal legate, John of Salerno, who held a council at Perth in December 1201, before leaving for business in Ireland. Legate John once again visited Scotland on his way back from Ireland, staying for more than fifty days at Melrose. However, nothing came of the charge.Walter Bower relates that William received the permission of King William to visit his relatives in France. This was perhaps between May 1212 and Spring 1213, when Bishop William disappears from the records. When not visiting home, Bishop William, like most other Bishops of St. Andrews, was keen to expand the power of the bishopric. In one instance, when Gille \u00cdsu, the hereditary priest of Wedale (Peebleshire) died, he took the opportunity to absorb the church into his diocese. Bishop William enjoyed good relations with the native Scottish clerical order of his diocese, the people \"qui Keledei vulgariter appellantur\" (commonly called C\u00e9li D\u00e9, Gaelic for \"Vassals of God\"). At some point between 1206 and 1216, and again in 1220, he managed to obtain absolution from the sentence of excommunication bestowed on the C\u00e9li D\u00e9 by the Pope; it may be that Bishop William's patronage ensured the opening priesthoods of its church, the Church of St Mary on the Rock at St. Andrews, to non-native clergy, to men such as Henry de Weles, and encouraged the order to consolidate its position vis-\u00e0-vis the papacy.According to the arguments of D.D.R. Owen, William was not only a bishop, but an author of Arthurian romance. The author of the romance known to us as the Roman de Fergus identifies himself as Guillaume le Clerc, or William the Clerk. In the words of Owen, \"it is most reasonable to keep our eyes open for any French clerk by the name of William (Guillaume)\" in the period concerned, and Owen uses textual and contextual evidence to show that William de Malveisin is one of the most likely known candidates.Bishop William died at a place called \"Inchemordauch\" (Inis Muiredaich), one of the Bishopric's manors, in 1238, probably on 9 July.

For example, in 470, he ordered officials and governors to offer him gifts, and when Sun Fengbo (\u5b6b\u5949\u4f2f) the governor of Shixing Commandery (\u59cb\u8208, roughly modern Shaoguan, Guangdong) only offered guqin and books, and not the treasures that Emperor Ming was hoping for, he sent poison to Sun to order him to commit suicide, although he soon retracted that order.  Also on one occasion, he held an imperial feast inside the palace, and ordered his ladies in waiting to strip for the guests. Empress Wang, embarrassed, covered her eyes with a fan. In anger, Emperor Ming said, \"Your household is so na\u00efve and unaware of the world.  Today everyone is trying to have fun, so why are you covering your eyes?\"  She responded, \"There are many ways to have fun.  What kind of a scene is it for aunts and sisters to gather to watch naked ladies in waiting and laugh about it?  The fun that our household has is different.\" He became angrier and chased her away.Historical accounts, written during the succeeding Southern Qi Dynasty, indicate that Emperor Ming was impotent, and that although he had 12 sons, those were the results of his having seized his brothers' pregnant concubines and kept the children if they bore males, or his having had his concubines have sexual relations with others.  (However, the fact that Empress Wang had two daughters, although no sons, may argue against such allegations, because it appeared rather unlikely that Emperor Ming would do this over female children\u2014indeed, the allegations stated that he would only do this if his brothers' concubines bore males\u2014or that the morally upright Empress Wang would engage in sexual relations with others, thus suggesting that the allegations were made to delegitimize Emperor Ming's sons Emperor Houfei and Emperor Shun vis-\u00e0-vis Southern Qi.)  In addition, Emperor Ming was said to be suspicious, jealous, cruel, and violent.  In addition, he was also superstitious, and his officials and attendants were forced to observe a number of taboos in both language and acts.  Whoever violated these taboos would be executed, often in cruel manners, including having their hearts cut open or their entrails pulled out.\nIn 471, Emperor Ming grew ill, and as Crown Prince Yu was only eight, he was fearful that his brothers would seize the throne, and therefore turned against them.  His first target was Liu Xiuyou the Prince of Jinping, who was considered arrogant and violent and often offended Emperor Ming.  Emperor Ming therefore, when he was out on a hunt with Liu Xiuyou, found an opportunity to have his guards push Liu Xiuyou off his horse and then pounded to death.  When this news reached his youngest brother, Liu Xiuruo (\u5289\u4f11\u82e5) the Prince of Baling, the governor of Jing Province, Liu Xiuruo's staff members suggest that he start a rebellion, particularly in light of orders for him to return to Jiankang and then take up Liu Xiuyou's old post at governor of South Xu Province (\u5357\u5f90\u5dde, modern western central Jiangsu), but the cautious Liu Xiuruo did not rebel, but instead reported to South Xu.  Meanwhile, because the public believed that Liu Xiuren would become regent if Emperor Ming died, the mid-level officials were all trying to ingratiate themselves with Liu Xiuren and his staff, drawing Emperor Ming's anger and suspicion, and he forced Liu Xiuren to commit suicide.  He then summoned Liu Xiuruo back to Jiankang and forced him to commit suicide as well.  The only brother who was spared with Liu Xiufan (\u5289\u4f11\u7bc4) the Prince of Guiyang, who was considered to be unvirtuous and incompetent, and therefore not viewed as a threat.\nEmperor Ming's suspicions soon turned to other officials as well.  In order to test the attitude of Xiao Daocheng the governor of South Yan Province (\u5357\u5157\u5dde, modern eastern central Jiangsu), he had his strategist Wu Xi deliver a pot of wine to Xiao.  Xiao, believing that wine was poisoned, was about to flee to Northern Wei, when Wu revealed that the wine was not poisonous and that Emperor Ming was merely trying to test him, and Wu drank some of the wine first to show Xiao.  Xiao then drank the wine, and Wu returned to the capital and vouched for Xiao's loyalty, but his leaking of the non-poisonous nature of the wine was soon revealed.  Emperor Ming, who was already suspicious of Wu's abilities, forced him to commit suicide.  In fear, Empress Wang's brother Wang Jingwen (\u738b\u666f\u6587), the commander of the armed forces, tried to resign.  Emperor Ming would not let him do so, and then, suspecting that Wang would take power after Emperor Ming's death, forced Wang to commit suicide in spring 472.

{"id": "106_71", "question": "What kind of work does Kim Friedman do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "19_35947", "text": "Hayek's influence on the development of economics is widely acknowledged. With regard to the popularity of his Nobel acceptance lecture, Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after Kenneth Arrow) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics. Hayek wrote critically there of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical modelisation. A number of Nobel Laureates in economics, such as Vernon Smith and Herbert A. Simon, recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist. Another Nobel winner, Paul Samuelson, believed that Hayek was worthy of his award, but nevertheless claimed that \"there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last half of the twentieth century economist fraternity. In 1931, Hayek's Prices and Production had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927\u20131931 (and the 1931\u20132007) historical scene\". Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to have been right and his own teacher Joseph Schumpeter to have been wrong on the central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy.Hayek is widely recognised for having introduced the time dimension to the equilibrium construction and for his key role in helping inspire the fields of growth theory, information economics and the theory of spontaneous order. The \"informal\" economics presented in Milton Friedman's massively influential popular work Free to Choose (1980) is explicitly Hayekian in its account of the price system as a system for transmitting and co-ordinating knowledge. This can be explained by the fact that Friedman taught Hayek's famous paper \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" (1945) in his graduate seminars.\nIn 1944, he was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy after he was nominated for membership by Keynes.Harvard economist and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers explains Hayek's place in modern economics: \"What's the single most important thing to learn from an economics course today? What I tried to leave my students with is the view that the invisible hand is more powerful than the [un]hidden hand. Things will happen in well-organized efforts without direction, controls, plans. That's the consensus among economists. That's the Hayek legacy\".By 1947, Hayek was an organiser of the Mont Pelerin Society, a group of classical liberals who sought to oppose socialism. Hayek was also instrumental in the founding of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the right-wing libertarian and free-market think tank that inspired Thatcherism. He was in addition a member of the conservative and libertarian Philadelphia Society.Hayek had a long-standing and close friendship with philosopher of science Karl Popper, who was also from Vienna. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated: \"I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps Alfred Tarski\". Popper dedicated his Conjectures and Refutations to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, to Popper and in 1982 said that \"ever since his Logik der Forschung first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology\". Popper also participated in the inaugural meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society. Their friendship and mutual admiration do not change the fact that there are important differences between their ideas.\nHayek also played a central role in Milton Friedman's intellectual development. Friedman wrote: My interest in public policy and political philosophy was rather casual before I joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. Informal discussions with colleagues and friends stimulated a greater interest, which was reinforced by Friedrich Hayek's powerful book The Road to Serfdom, by my attendance at the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, and by discussions with Hayek after he joined the university faculty in 1950. In addition, Hayek attracted an exceptionally able group of students who were dedicated to a libertarian ideology. They started a student publication, The New Individualist Review, which was the outstanding libertarian journal of opinion for some years. I served as an adviser to the journal and published a number of articles in it....\nWhile Friedman often mentioned Hayek as an important influence, Hayek rarely mentioned Friedman. He deeply disagreed with Chicago School methodology, quantitative and macroeconomic focus, and claimed that Friedman's Essays in Positive Economics was as dangerous a book as Keynes' General Theory. Friedman also claimed that despite some Popperian influence Hayek always retained basic Misesian praxeological view which he found \"utterly nonsensical\". He also noted that he admired Hayek only for his political works and disagreed with his technical economics; he called Prices and Production a \"very flawed book\" and The Pure Theory of Capital \"unreadable\".  There were occasional tensions at the Mont Pelerin meetings between the Hayek's and Friedman's followers that sometimes threatened to split the Society. Although they worked at the same university and shared political beliefs, Hayek and Friedman rarely collaborated professionally and were not close friends.Hayek's greatest intellectual debt was to Carl Menger, who pioneered an approach to social explanation similar to that developed in Britain by Bernard Mandeville and the Scottish moral philosophers in the Scottish Enlightenment. He had a wide-reaching influence on contemporary economics, politics, philosophy, sociology, psychology and anthropology. For example, Hayek's discussion in The Road to Serfdom (1944) about truth, falsehood and the use of language influenced some later opponents of postmodernism.\nSome radical libertarians had a negative view of Hayek and his milder form of liberalism. Ayn Rand disliked him, seeing him as a conservative and compromiser. In a letter to Rose Wilder Lane in 1946 she wrote:Now to your question: 'Do those almost with us do more harm than 100% enemies?' I don't think this can be answered with a flat 'yes' or 'no,' because the 'almost' is such a wide term. There is one general rule to observe: those who are with us, but merely do not go far enough are the ones who may do us some good. Those who agree with us in some respects, yet preach contradictory ideas at the same time, are definitely more harmful than 100% enemies. As an example of the kind of 'almost' I would tolerate, I'd name Ludwig von Mises. As an example of our most pernicious enemy, I would name Hayek. That one is real poison.\nHayek made no known written references to Rand.Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales was influenced by Hayek's ideas on spontaneous order and the Austrian School of economics, after being exposed to these ideas by Austrian economist and Mises Institute Senior Fellow Mark Thornton.In the 21st century, some libertarian political scientists argue that Hayek would be in favor of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies due to its resistance to political pressure and due to Hayek's emphasis of sound money and competition in currencies. They also argue that cryptocurrency and Bitcoin serve as a \"Hayekian Escape,\" a method that the people can use to escape the government's currency monopoly.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Taylor do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_40954", "text": "As parts of Jazz Track and Jazz at the Plaza, respectively, the '58 Sessions chronicled the transition from the brawny agitation of Milestones, to the cerebral tranquility of Kind of Blue. The recording sessions also became known as a stepping stone in Davis' move from bebop to modal jazz. The live side in particular was seen by critics as a glimpse at the sextet that would record Kind of Blue. The complementary and seemingly spontaneous style of performance ethic and the relationship between Davis and his musicians was fundamental for his work during these sessions and improved onto the Kind of Blue sessions.\nJazz historian and journalist Ira Gitler has considered 1958 Miles to be one of Davis' best works, while also noting that he was \"very taken with the performances\", alluding to the album's recordings after Gitler had listened to them. In the 1979 LP reissue liner notes, Gitler wrote \"These prime cuts of the Miles Davis Sextet, representative of what this most influential leader and his trendsetting band of that time, were doing in that particular portion of 1958, are a most welcome addition to the collectors library.\" The live portion of the album recorded at The Plaza Hotel was noted by critics as an early stage of the new sextet. Music writer Nicholas Taylor later wrote of the Plaza set:\n\nAn interesting and puzzling period piece, documenting the sextet exploring a sound that would soon morph into the rich tapestry of their 1959 masterpiece ... It is the snapshot\u2014albeit a blurred one\u2014of a group of musicians on the verge of greatness, beginning to feel each other\u2019s tics and idiosyncrasies, forming the bonds of a sextet that would soon alter the history of jazz forever.\nPrior to the live session, Miles Davis had already established a reputation as one of the jazz era's top live performers, following well-received performances at such venues as Birdland, also known as \"The Jazz Corner of the World\", in New York and the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island during the mid-1950s. The set at the Plaza Hotel further expanded Davis' repertoire in concert venues and increased his popularity among jazz fans and writers. Even though Milestones was Davis' first use of modes and Cannonball Adderley's presence helped make the band became a more powerful sextet, these sessions helped introduce Bill Evans to the music of Miles Davis. The May 26 session, in particular, exposed Evans to Davis' spontaneous ability in the studio to simplify complicated musical structures. In a 1979 interview for the jazz radio station WKCR, Evans remarked on his recording experience with Davis, stating \"Miles occasionally might say, 'Right here, I want this sound', and it turn out be a very key thing that changes the whole character of the [song]. For instance, on 'On Green Dolphin Street', the original changes of the chorus aren't the way [we recorded it]: the vamp changes being a major seventh up a minor third, down a half tone. That was [one when] he leaned over and said, 'I want this here.'\" Evans' influence would be apparent on the Kind of Blue sessions as it was during the initial 1958 sessions. All recorded studio work by Davis from 1958 for Columbia was later reissued on the box set compilation The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane. Following the implementation of his first modal compositions with the title track of Milestones and his first sessions with Bill Evans, the 1958 Sessions, Davis became satisfied with the results. This led to his preparation of an entire album based on modality, his 1959 masterwork, Kind of Blue.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Linney recalled that his mother \"was a very good amateur actress\" and when she starred in the Nashville Community Theatre's 1940 production of Our Town as Mrs. Gibbs, he was deeply moved by her performance, particularly by her character's death. \"I became really connected to my mother and it was the first time I was really shattered by a play. And in many ways that was the beginning. It, in a very visceral way, showed me the profound impact theater can have... Music might give you exultation or something else equally profound, but theater at a great stroke can just shatter you, can break you.\" Linney's father died of throat cancer when Linney was 13 years old. Linney said about his father's death, \"I've never gotten over it. My father was a very good man...I think his death is in everything I do.

{"id": "106_112", "question": "What kind of work does Basil Moore do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27701", "text": "In 1983, DC Comics acquired a line of characters from Charlton Comics. During that period, writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp, as he had done in his Miracleman series in the early 1980s. Moore reasoned that MLJ Comics' Mighty Crusaders might be available for such a project, so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of the Shield in a harbor. The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used, as long as readers recognized them \"so it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was\". Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled Who Killed the Peacemaker, and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor Dick Giordano. Giordano was receptive to the proposal, but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story. After the acquisition of Charlton's Action Hero line, DC intended to use their upcoming Crisis on Infinite Earths event to fold them into their mainstream superhero universe. Moore said, \"DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional.\" Instead, Giordano persuaded Moore to continue his project but with new characters that simply resembled the Charlton heroes. Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for readers but later changed his mind. He said, \"Eventually, I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough, so that they seemed familiar in certain ways, certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super-hero resonance or familiarity to the reader, then it might work.\"\n\nArtist Dave Gibbons, who had collaborated with Moore on previous projects, recalled that he \"must have heard on the grapevine that he was doing a treatment for a new miniseries. I rang Alan up, saying I'd like to be involved with what he was doing\", and Moore sent him the story outline. Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved. Gibbons brought colorist John Higgins onto the project because he liked his \"unusual\" style; Higgins lived near the artist, which allowed the two to \"discuss [the art] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean\". Len Wein joined the project as its editor, while Giordano stayed on to oversee it. Both Wein and Giordano stood back and \"got out of their way\", as Giordano remarked later. \"Who copy-edits Alan Moore, for God's sake?\"After receiving the go-ahead to work on the project, Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter's house creating characters, crafting details for the story's milieu and discussing influences. The pair were particularly influenced by a Mad parody of Superman named \"Superduperman\"; Moore said: \"We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees\u2014dramatic, instead of comedic\". Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take \"familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm\"; Moore said his intention was to create \"a superhero Moby Dick; something that had that sort of weight, that sort of density\". Moore came up with the character names and descriptions but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons. Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately, but rather \"did it at odd times [...] spend[ing] maybe two or three weeks just doing sketches.\" Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw; Rorschach was his favorite to draw because \"you just have to draw a hat. If you can draw a hat, then you've drawn Rorschach, you just draw kind of a shape for his face and put some black blobs on it and you're done.\"Moore began writing the series very early on, hoping to avoid publication delays such as those faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue Moore said he realized \"I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!\" His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that \"[t]he script for the first issue of Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript\u2014single-spaced\u2014with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages.\" Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page \"in case I drop them on the floor, because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order\", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, \"It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper.\" Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note \"If that doesn't work for you, do what works best\"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested one single change to the script - a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach - as he felt that the dialogue was too long to fit with the length of the action; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons had a great deal of autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.Despite his intentions, Moore admitted in November 1986 that there were likely to be delays, stating that he was, with issue five on the stands, still writing issue nine. Gibbons mentioned that a major factor in the delays was the \"piecemeal way\" in which he received Moore's scripts. Gibbons said the team's pace slowed around the fourth issue; from that point onward the two undertook their work \"just several pages at a time. I'll get three pages of script from Alan and draw it and then toward the end, call him up and say, 'Feed me!' And he'll send another two or three pages or maybe one page or sometimes six pages.\" As the creators began to hit deadlines, Moore would hire a taxi driver to drive 50 miles and deliver scripts to Gibbons. On later issues the artist even had his wife and son draw panel grids on pages to help save time.Near the end of the project, Moore realized that the story bore some similarity to \"The Architects of Fear\", an episode of The Outer Limits television series. The writer and Wein (an editor) argued over changing the ending and when Moore refused to give in, Wein quit the book. Wein explained, \"I kept telling him, 'Be more original, Alan, you've got the capability, do something different, not something that's already been done!' And he didn't seem to care enough to do that.\" Moore acknowledged the Outer Limits episode by referencing it in the series' last issue.", "hasanswer": false}]}

McNamara mentioned that he had been spending sometime in London writing material while the other members were building a recording studio, and that they were aiming to release a new single later in the year. According to McNamara, MacDonald told the band he was impressed with their live performances and that they had high-quality songwriting but had \"never made a classic album\", which was something he wanted for the label. He was content with them taking as long as they wanted for as much money as they needed.Drummer Mike Heaton said they did not have the means of writing songs in peace previously, often feeling stressed while out touring. In December 2003, the band played a few shows under the moniker the Good Good People; McNamara explained that he had spent the \"last two years doing nothing but writing songs\".

Since his death, Jeet Kune Do is argued to have split into different groups. They are:\nThe Original (or Jun Fan) JKD branch, whose proponents include Taky Kimura, James Lee, Jerry Poteet, and Ted Wong;  these groups claim to teach what was believed to be only what was taught by Bruce Lee, and encourage the student to further develop his or her abilities through those teachings.  The inherent training principles of this branch are shaped by the static concept of what was \"originally taught\", just as the training systems of \"traditional\" martial arts have been taught for centuries and become recognizable as \"styles\", except it is referred to as a philosophy of \"style without style\".\nThe JKD Concepts branch, whose proponents include Dan Inosanto, Richard Bustillo, and Larry Hartsell; these groups strive to continue the philosophy of individual self-expression through re-interpretation of combat systems through the lens of Jeet Kune Do, under the concept that it was never meant to be a static art but rather an ongoing evolution, and have incorporated elements from many other martial arts into the main fold of its teachings (most notably, grappling and Kali / Escrima material) based on the individual's personal preferences and physical attributes.  The entire JKD \"system\" can be described through a simple diagram, and the concepts can then be applied to a variety of contexts in a \"universal\" way.To understand the branches of JKD it is important to understand the difference between the two \"types\" or viewpoints of Jeet Kune Do:\n\nJKD framework: This type of JKD provides the guiding principles.  Bruce Lee experimented with many styles and techniques to reach these conclusions.  To Lee these principles were truisms.  The JKD framework is not bound or confined by any styles or systems.  This type of JKD is a process.\nJKD Personal Systems: This type of JKD utilizes the JKD framework along with any techniques from any other style or system to construct a \"personal system\". This approach utilizes a \"building blocks\" manner in which to construct a personalized system that is especially tailored to an individual. Lee believed that only an individual could determine for themselves what the usefulness of any technique should be.  This type of JKD is thus a product.Lee believed that this freedom of adoption was a distinguishing property from traditional martial arts.There are many who confuse the JKD Framework with a JKD Personal System (IE. Bruce Lee's personal JKD) thinking them to be one and the same.  The system that Bruce Lee personally expressed was his own personal JKD; tailored for himself.  Before he could do this, however, he needed to first develop the \"JKD Framework\" process. Many of the systems that Bruce Lee studied were not to develop his \"Personal JKD\" but rather was used to gather the \"principles\" for incorporation in the JKD Framework approach. The uniqueness of JKD to Lee is that it was a \"process\" not a \"product\" and thus not a \"style\" but a system, concept, or approach.  Traditional martial arts styles are essentially a product that is given to a student with little provision for change.  These traditional styles are usually fixed and not tailored for individuals. Bruce Lee claimed there were inherent problems with this approach and established a \"Process\" based system rather than a fixed style which a student could then utilize to make a \"tailored\" or \"Personal\" product of their own.The two branches of JKD differ in what should be incorporated or offered within the \"JKD Framework\".  The Original (or Jun Fan) JKD branch believes that the original principles before Bruce Lee died are all that is needed for the construction of personalized systems.JKD Concepts branch believe that there are further principles that can be added to construct personalized systems.  The value of each Branch can be determined by individual practitioners based on whatever merits they deem important.Original JKD is further divided into two points of view.\nOJKD and JFJKD both hold Wing Chun, Western boxing and fencing as the cornerstones on Bruce's JKD.\n\nOJKD follows all Bruce's training from early Jun Fan Gung Fu (Seattle period) and focuses on trapping with Wing Chun influence.\nJun Fan Jeet Kune Do is a signature version of JKD as Bruce taught privately to Ted Wong. This is a later time period and practices a greater emphasis on elusiveness and simplified trapping unique to Bruce's later approach to combat. The focus is with fencing and Western boxing.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He joined the French Communist Party at the age of 17 in 1939 when the Communist Party was banned for supporting the German-Soviet pact. In July 1940, he created a student club, the Centre la\u00efque des auberges de la jeunesse (Claj), which served as a legal screen for the clandestine Union of Communist Students.When David Rousset (1912-1997) spoke out about Stalin's vast system of prison camps, Daix attacked him as a liar, denying that the GULAG system existed in the Soviet Union, in a 16 page article in Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises, entitled \"Pourquoi M. David Rousset a-t-il invent\u00e9 les camps sovi\u00e9tiques?\". Rousset brought libel charges against Daix and there was a public trial in France, which Rousset, who had told the truth about the camps, won in 1950.  As a French communist, Daix continued his uncritical support for the Soviet Union for many years, though late in life he admitted he had been wrong.From 1980 to 1985, he was a journalist for Le Quotidien de Paris.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

His father, Ranieri, was from a leading wealthy family in Urbino. Ranieri was noted for his role as a soldier and also as the author of two books on military architecture. The Duke of Urbino, Duke Guidobaldo II, honoured him with the title Marchese del Monte so the family had only become a noble one in the generation before Guidobaldo. On the death of his father Guidobaldo inherited the title of Marchese.\nGuidobaldo studied mathematics at the University of Padua in 1564. While there he became a friend of the great Italian poet Torquato Tasso. In fact Guidobaldo may have known Tasso before they studied at Padua together, for Tasso was almost exactly the same age as Guidobaldo and had been educated at the court of the Duke of Urbino, with the duke's son, from 1556.\nGuidobaldo then served as a soldier in the ensuing conflict in Hungary between the Habsburg Empire and the Ottoman Empire. After serving in the army, Guidobaldo returned to his estate of (Monte Baroccio) Mombaroccio in the Marche, where he was able to spend his time doing research into mathematics, mechanics, astronomy and optics. He studied mathematics under Federico Commandino during this period and became one of his most staunch disciples. He also became a friend of Bernardino Baldi, who was also a student of Commandino around the same time.\nHe corresponded with several mathematicians including Giacomo Contarini, Francesco Barozzi and Galileo Galilei. His invention of a drafting instrument for constructing regular polygons and dividing a line into any number of segments was incorporated as a feature of Galileo's geometric and military compass.\nGuidobaldo was also important in helping Galileo Galilei in his academic career. Galileo, then a promising, but unemployed 26-year-old, had written an essay on hydrostatic balance, which struck Guidobaldo as being nothing short of genius. He then commended Galileo to his brother, the Cardinal Del Monte, who referred him to the powerful Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando I de' Medici. Under his patronage, Galileo got an indication to a professorship of mathematics at the University of Pisa, in 1589. Guidobaldo became a staunch friend of Galileo and helped him again in 1592, when he had to apply to the chair of mathematics at the University of Padua, due to the hatred and machinations of Giovanni de' Medici, a son of Cosimo I de' Medici, against Galileo. Notwithstanding their friendship, Guidobaldo was a critic of Galileo's principle of the isochronicity of the pendulum, a major discovery which Guidobaldo thought was impossible.\nGuidobaldo wrote an influential book about perspective, titled Perspectivae Libri VI, published at Pesaro in 1600. Several painters, architects and the theater stage designer Nicola Sabbatini used this geometrical knowledge in their works.\nHe died at Mombaroccio in 1607.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After being diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, Vicki faced the hard choice of leaving Homicide Division in the police department and working a desk job or leaving the police force altogether. Despite strong protests from her partner and lover, Detective Mike Celluci, she decided to leave the force and open a private investigation firm.\nThough her vision does prove to be a problem at times, Vicki refuses to let anyone treat her like she is disabled and continues to take risks with her life throughout the course of her investigations. As a result of leaving the force, her relationship with Celluci has become on-again/off-again. Meanwhile, her growing attraction to Henry only fuels the complications in her love life, putting her in the center of a supernatural love triangle.\nHenry Fitzroy\n(b. June 15, 1519 d. June 18, 1536 reborn June 19, 1536) Based on the historical character Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset - the illegitimate son of Henry VIII of England, Henry Fitzroy chose love over familial duty and sacrificed his mortal life to remain forever with the woman he loved; Christina.  Vampiric circumstances, however, prevented him from remaining with her and now, after 470 years of existence, he is living in Toronto as a graphic novelist (a.k.a. comic book artist)- \"Art and literature have always been my passions.  I finally found a medium where I could fully realize the both of them.\"  His quiet, hidden life takes on a new twist when he collides with Vicki Nelson in an attempt to stop a man from bringing the demon Asteroth into the mortal world. As they work to solve this case, and subsequently other supernatural problems, Henry grows deeply attracted to Vicki's willful nature and exuberance for life, eventually falling for her. Though she seems to resist his advances, he continues to pursue her and, mostly due to his centuries of experience and knowledge of both sides of the supernatural, he becomes Vicki's partner and bodyguard.\nDetective Mike Celluci\nVicki's former partner, as well as on/off lover, he was very much against her decision to leave the force. He and Vicki share many personality traits, which often results in arguments between the two. Yet despite (or perhaps because of) this they are firm friends, both going so far as to discuss their current cases. As straight as they come, and a \"see it to believe it\" kind of guy to boot, Mike often exhibits concern over the kind of cases Vicki seems willing to take on in her new career. He has trouble accepting Vicki's friendship and trust in Henry, even more so once he finds out what Henry is, often coming across as jealous. However, they have been known to work together on occasion - especially when it is Vicki who needs help.\nCoreen Fennel\nCoreen becomes known to Vicki during her first \"unusual\" case, hiring her to find out who killed her boyfriend. Once the case was over, she managed to insinuate herself into the position of Vicki's office assistant. Coreen appears to have extensive knowledge about the occult, and is certainly far more curious and accepting of it than any of the other characters. Because of this, she seems to have struck up a friendship with Dr. Sagara, a professor of the occult known to Henry, and the two can occasionally be seen working together on a case for Vicki. Coreen can at times serve as an emissary between Vicki and Mike, usually trying to get Vicki talking with him again. It was shown various times that she may have a crush on Henry, most prominently when first meeting him. However, when the two rarely work together, Coreen's lingering looks may suggest that she has a crush on him or it may be the way Henry naturally attracts women. This character does not appear in the books beyond the \"client\" role she originated in the first episode, and it has been suggested that she \"replaced\" the character of Tony. Several sources cite the omission of Tony as being due to copyright reasons in that the rights to the series of books that feature Tony are owned by another network. Fan sites claim that there were aspects of Tony's free-spirited, reformed street hustler character that might have proved offensive or unsettling to the general viewing public.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "106_164", "question": "What kind of work does William Heberden do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_42236", "text": "Webster is recognized as an extremely experienced and talented metal bass player. He can play at exceptionally fast speeds, and does a signature 3-finger walk (a \"galloping\" finger motion). He revealed in a making-of DVD for Cannibal Corpse's album The Wretched Spawn that he initially started playing guitar but changed to bass because he felt he could master the instrument more quickly. Unlike usual heavy metal bassists that play at high speeds, Webster is able to play his instrument without the use of a pick, while still retaining a clean clear tone, which helps maintain clarity in the complex and very fast lines he plays in conjunction with the heavily distorted guitars of Cannibal Corpse.\n\n\"When I was six years old I took some acoustic guitar lessons. It didn't really work out because I was six and didn't really want to learn \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" and those were the kind of songs I was being taught. I wanted to play Elvis. I liked all the old 50s music. My dad had a bunch of old 50s records because that's when he was a teenager. Those were what I listened to, because when you're six you don't have the money to go buy stuff, so I just listened to his records. Nobody was going to teach me how to play the guitar like that, out in the country where I lived. I just gave it up until I was 13 or 14. I met a kid in school who played bass in the high school jazz band. He wanted to make some extra money and it was five bucks a lesson. He did a good job too. His name was Mike Hudson. I don't know if he plays anymore. I lost touch with him. He's the one that got me started. I always wanted to play in a band, and to learn how to play lead guitar was going to take like five years. But I really liked the sound of the bass. I liked AC/DC and figured I could do that. I thought I could learn Cliff Williams' bass parts faster than I could learn to play Angus Young's guitar parts. It was motivation, because I wanted to be in a band. I never wanted to sit around and play music by myself. I wanted to play with other people, and the fastest route to that was playing an instrument that wasn't a lead instrument, and bass was that. Now I've learned to make it a lot more difficult. I've made my job a lot harder than it probably needs to be. But it's just fun. In the beginning my concern was playing in a band.\"\"I took some lessons from a friend of mine when I first started. He was in the school jazz band and he taught me the basics. I didn't take lessons for about a year, but I started again when I was a senior in high school. I've had about four different teachers throughout the years, but I never took lessons for more than a few months. I did, however, gain a lot from them and I've tried to learn as much on my own as I can. Anything I can learn about music or bass playing, I'll try to learn. I mean, the more you learn and the more you apply to your playing, it just makes you a better musician.\"\"I liked the bass player from AC/DC. I really loved the stuff he did. Peter Baltes from Accept was another. I liked the really good guys too, but that seemed out of reach at the beginning. Geddy Lee from Rush and Steve Harris were like gods to me. Billy Sheehan was from Buffalo, and we all knew about Billy before the rest of the country did. Billy has been a legend in Buffalo for a long, long time. He's still one of my favorites. By the time I was listening to Cliff Burton I was getting a little better. I had been playing a year or so before I started listening to Metallica. I thought he was great. I always thought he could have been a little louder on those albums though. That's the thing. In thrash metal or any other kind of metal where the bass is playing exactly what the guitar is playing, automatically the bass went down in the mix. If you notice those older bands like Accept, the bass is doing something that's a little bit different from the guitar. It's more with the kick drum instead of playing the riff the guitar is doing. In thrash metal and then death metal, the bass player always wound up playing what the guitar player was doing most of the time. It's been a decade long fight for us to be heard in the mix.\"\"I'd like to do some instructional material, but I'm still not sure if I'll try and do a DVD or book though. It will probably be easier to do a DVD, actually. Hopefully I'll be able to come up with some stuff that's worth releasing. I definitely won't put anything out until I'm sure it's of really high quality, and full of lots of good information. Also, you might have heard about the possibility of us doing a tab book. Well, we still haven't found a publisher for that.\"\"I practice the most when I have something I'm working on that's difficult, like one of Pat's songs for example. I usually won't practice for more than 3 or 4 hours a day unless I'm really inspired, or I have some kind of deadline.\"\n\nBesides playing bass, Alex has also contributed to lyric and music writing on many occasions for the band, some examples being \"Fucked with a Knife,\" \"Puncture Wound Massacre,\" \"I Will Kill You,\" \"Devoured by Vermin,\" \"Unleashing the Bloodthirsty,\" \"Scavenger consuming death,\" \"Scourge of iron\" and \"Murder Worship\".\nWebster is also known for his bass guitar solos/fills in such songs as \"Addicted to Vaginal Skin\", \"Mangled\", \"The Undead Will Feast\", \"Crushing the Despised\", \"Fucked with a Knife\", \"Hammer Smashed Face\", \"The Discipline of Revenge\", \"Put Them To Death\", \"She Was Asking For It\", \"Staring Through The Eyes of the Dead\", \"Bloodlands\", \"They Deserve to Die\", \"Rabid\", and \"The Strangulation Chair\".\nFrom 2013 to 2015 Webster wrote a monthly tuition column for the UK's Bass Guitar Magazine.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Expanding on Brian Barry's concept of \"luck\" (getting what you want without trying) he argues that some groups of people are \"systematically lucky\" in that they are advantaged because of the way society is structured. Such people are not powerful in the sense they have resources that they could use that other groups do not (though they might have this power as well) but rather systematically lucky in that they tend to get what they want without having to do anything. Alternatively, other groups are systematically unlucky. This argument has caused great controversy with critics including Brian Barry, Steven Lukes, Peter Morriss and more recently Andrew Hindmoor.Dowding has also worked on the Tiebout model of individuals moving location to get the local services they require, showing that such moving does occur in the UK though only to a small extent, and that people tend to move to areas for service reasons, but do not decide to leave from areas for those reasons. He has extended this work into examining Albert Hirschman's Exit, Voice and Loyalty Model and has a forthcoming Cambridge University Press book Exits, Voices and Social Investment co-authored with long-time collaborator Peter John extending and applying Hirschman's model to citizen satisfaction with government services.\nDowding also considered the theory of presidentialisation of British politics in his 2012 article, \u201cThe Prime Ministerialization of the British Prime Minister\u201d.

The Quarto version says \"Doll is sick\", not \"dead\", leaves out the \"my\", and makes no reference to losing a home.It has been suggested that a version of Henry V existed in which Falstaff appeared, perhaps married to Quickly (which he said he would do in Henry IV, Part 2). At the epilogue to Henry IV, Part 2 Shakespeare had promised another play to \"continue the story, with Sir John in it\", but Falstaff does not appear in existing versions of Henry V.

The publishing house would pay for the printing of the books, the distribution and advertising, that kind of thing. As an editor at that type of company, you have a lot more creative input than you would at a large publishing house, where editors tend to buy finished manuscripts rather than coming up with the ideas themselves.\nIt was funny, we were assigned to work on a series called \"Fear Street\" together, which was an R.L.

As a result of leaving the force, her relationship with Celluci has become on-again/off-again. Meanwhile, her growing attraction to Henry only fuels the complications in her love life, putting her in the center of a supernatural love triangle.\nHenry Fitzroy\n(b. June 15, 1519 d. June 18, 1536 reborn June 19, 1536) Based on the historical character Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset - the illegitimate son of Henry VIII of England, Henry Fitzroy chose love over familial duty and sacrificed his mortal life to remain forever with the woman he loved; Christina.  Vampiric circumstances, however, prevented him from remaining with her and now, after 470 years of existence, he is living in Toronto as a graphic novelist (a.k.a. comic book artist)- \"Art and literature have always been my passions.  I finally found a medium where I could fully realize the both of them.\"  His quiet, hidden life takes on a new twist when he collides with Vicki Nelson in an attempt to stop a man from bringing the demon Asteroth into the mortal world. As they work to solve this case, and subsequently other supernatural problems, Henry grows deeply attracted to Vicki's willful nature and exuberance for life, eventually falling for her. Though she seems to resist his advances, he continues to pursue her and, mostly due to his centuries of experience and knowledge of both sides of the supernatural, he becomes Vicki's partner and bodyguard.\nDetective Mike Celluci\nVicki's former partner, as well as on/off lover, he was very much against her decision to leave the force. He and Vicki share many personality traits, which often results in arguments between the two. Yet despite (or perhaps because of) this they are firm friends, both going so far as to discuss their current cases. As straight as they come, and a \"see it to believe it\" kind of guy to boot, Mike often exhibits concern over the kind of cases Vicki seems willing to take on in her new career. He has trouble accepting Vicki's friendship and trust in Henry, even more so once he finds out what Henry is, often coming across as jealous. However, they have been known to work together on occasion - especially when it is Vicki who needs help.\nCoreen Fennel\nCoreen becomes known to Vicki during her first \"unusual\" case, hiring her to find out who killed her boyfriend. Once the case was over, she managed to insinuate herself into the position of Vicki's office assistant. Coreen appears to have extensive knowledge about the occult, and is certainly far more curious and accepting of it than any of the other characters. Because of this, she seems to have struck up a friendship with Dr. Sagara, a professor of the occult known to Henry, and the two can occasionally be seen working together on a case for Vicki. Coreen can at times serve as an emissary between Vicki and Mike, usually trying to get Vicki talking with him again. It was shown various times that she may have a crush on Henry, most prominently when first meeting him. However, when the two rarely work together, Coreen's lingering looks may suggest that she has a crush on him or it may be the way Henry naturally attracts women. This character does not appear in the books beyond the \"client\" role she originated in the first episode, and it has been suggested that she \"replaced\" the character of Tony.

The family appears in the year-long filming of Ethical Man, and \"Ethical Wife\" contributed independently to the series by investigating his oil company holdings. She has written of their relationship and family life in her book Talking About Jane Austen in Baghdad. The couple jointly presented the 2013 documentary Make Me a German.Rowlatt's paternal great-grandfather, Sir Sidney Rowlatt, was a judge on the King's Bench Division of the High Court of England and Wales. In 1918, he headed the controversial Rowlatt Committee to evaluate terrorism and seditious movements in British India, and drafted the repressive Rowlatt Act, which authorised stricter press censorship and the arrest and indefinite detention of suspects without due process. The passage of the Act in March 1919 ignited protests across the subcontinent and led directly to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (also known as the Amritsar Massacre); it has been cited as a major factor in stimulating and expanding the Indian independence movement.\nAs the South Asia correspondent for the BBC, Justin Rowlatt acknowledged his family connection in August 2017. In a BBC article examining the post-1947 India-British relationship, he said he had initially been worried his surname would prove a handicap during his posting in India, but that it had not, as the nation had largely moved on.His maternal grandfather, Theo Ionides, was born in 1900 and, although eager to participate in World War I, just missed action. He studied engineering at Oxford University, and settled in India to work with Ralli Brothers until it folded in the 1930s. When World War II started, Ionides joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. He was handpicked by Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond series, to join No. 30 Commando, a special intelligence unit tasked to move ahead of advancing Allied forces. His unit crossed the Channel a few days after D-Day; Ionides was killed by a German bomb that night. His daughter Penelope, Rowlatt's mother, was a young child then, and so grew up without a father.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1982-1983, Steinhardt, Linde and Alexander Vilenkin realized that exponential expansion in the new inflation scenario, once it begins, continues without end in some parts of the universe. On the basis of this scenario, Linde proposed a model of a self-reproducing inflationary universe consisting of different parts. These parts are exponentially large and uniform, because of inflation. Therefore, for all practical purposes each of these parts looks like a separate mini-universe, or pocket universe, independent of what happens in other parts of the universe.\nInhabitants of each of these parts might think that the universe everywhere looks the same, and masses of elementary particles, as well as the laws of their interactions, must be the same all over the world. However, in the context of inflationary cosmology, different pocket universes may have different laws of low-energy physics operating in each of them. Thus our world, instead of being a single spherically symmetric expanding balloon, becomes a huge fractal, an inflationary multiverse consisting of many different pocket universes with different properties. This provided a simple scientific interpretation of the cosmological anthropic principle: Our world may consist of different parts, but we can live only in those parts of the multiverse which can support life as we know it.\nThese ideas did not attract much attention at that time, in part because the anthropic principle was very unpopular, in part because the new inflationary scenario did not quite work and was replaced by the chaotic inflation scenario. However, in 1986 Linde found that in many versions of the chaotic inflation scenario, the process of exponential expansion of the universe also continues forever in some parts of the universe. Linde called this process eternal inflation. Quantum fluctuations produced during eternal chaotic inflation are so large that they can easily push different parts of the universe from one vacuum state to another, and even change the effective dimensionality of spacetime. This provided a very powerful realization of the theory of the multiverse.\nLinde and his Stanford colleague Vitaly Vanchurin calculated the number of all possible universes, to be about 10^10^16 if we do not consider the fact that humans as observers are limited in their ability to distinguish more universes. If this is taken into account, there could be as many as 10^10^10^7 universes. By analyzing the slow-roll inflation mechanism that initially generated the quantum fluctuations, the scientists could estimate the number of resulting universes at 10^10^10^7.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "106_209", "question": "What kind of work does Danny Joe do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_27484", "text": "The play takes place in what Katharine Worth describes as \"an unidentified \u2018listening\u2019 space,\" another of Beckett\u2019s \"skullscapes.\" The only specific location mentioned is \"the tower\" \u2013 perhaps a folly(?) \u2013 so the scene may well be in a castle or similarly large building of some kind with Croak in the role of ch\u00e2telain.\nCroak is a doddery old man, testy and maudlin. He is never referred to by name in the play itself but he is well named. Joe addresses to him \u2013 albeit somewhat obsequiously \u2013 as, \"My Lord,\" since, despite his apparent frailty, he has plainly been someone used to wielding authority. There are only three sound effects used in the entire play, the shuffle [Beckett's descriptive stage direction) of Croak's feet as he arrives and departs, the thud/dropping of his club (staff?) reminiscent of the rulers wielded by the Animator in Rough for Radio II and the music teacher in Embers and the rapping of Music's baton reminiscent of a once prevalent practice among conductors of the past which is now far less widespread. The club and baton function as objects of authority. They form an interesting dyad prominently employed throughout the play.\nFor entertainment, Croak, (a Beckettian \u2018old King Cole\u2019) has only two old stalwarts to call on, his minstrels, Joe (Words) and Bob (Music). Each is heard to be possibly an abstraction and/or a being of some sort manifested through their respective vocabularies (music/words). Do they have actual physical form? This remains an unanswerable question. With radio remaining a solely sonic medium, we can only conjecture (Beckett sets up similar uncertainty in much of his work). Words/Music function in a way resembling court artists/musicians of the past. Word's repeatedly addressing Croak as \"My Lord\" and the strange formality to the domination both Words/Joe and Music/Bob seem accustomed to enduring adds an ancient (medieval?) or primitively regal aspect to the proceedings.\nThe modern shortened names (Joe, Bob) add a humorous contemporary contrast to the generally ancient (or timeless) seeming circumstances. The source of Croak's power over them is never explained or questioned-adding to the mysterious atmosphere.\nAlfred Alvarez refers to Croak as \"a poet\" though there is no real evidence to suggest that he is. In fact his utterances throughout the play are terse: moans, groans and murmurings mainly along with a few short lines (commands, entreaties or outbursts). That said, he appears to appreciate poetry especially when set to music. The first theme Croak proclaims for the evening's diversion is \"Love.\" Beckett offers several clues to help imagine Croak as a specific character. His shuffling feet, choice of themes, self-torturing reminiscence and intense reactions to much of what Words and Music produce/perform all seem to indicate that he is a decrepit version of Orsino with his famous opening line from Twelfth Night: \"If music be the food of love, play on,\" a hopeless romantic, in love with love, and the melancholy brought on by the mere thought of it. Croak could almost be the selfsame man, had he never moved from that spot for the rest of his life and now finds himself perhaps approaching the brink of death. Or does this gathering occur again and again outside time? So many Beckett works present characters seemingly caught in endless cycles of repetition (those who wait in \"Waiting for Godot\"/the appearing-disappearing woman in \"Ill Seen Ill Said\"/The urn-dwelling trio in \"Play\" etc.) that this is always a possibility.\nAdditional related aspects of Love that Croak focuses on as sub-themes are \"Age,\" \"Face,\" (With two foreshadowing mentions earlier on in the play-once by Croak and then latter by Words) and the climactic naming of \"Lily\" which is discussed later regarding its various implications. After this iteration Croak is reduced to groans, an anguished \"No!\" and the eventual dropping of his \"club\" followed by shuffling away. His entrance/exit frames the main body of the play.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He does his best to get around his mother's arrangements by bribing the people in his life to spread the idea that he is obedient.

Notoriously hard-to-please critic, Robert Christgau, credited these albums with Murray's \"gradual revitilazation...\" thanks to Jim Ed Norman's \"...clean, honest, Nashville-quality work\".The albums were platinum-selling successes, spawning multiple hit singles including the US #1 \"You Needed Me\", which went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and a string of US AC chart-toppers \u2013 \"I Just Fall in Love Again\", \"Shadows in the Moonlight\", \"Broken Hearted Me\", and \"Daydream Believer\". Norman's work with Murray extended well into the 1980s during which he produced the Grammy-winning A Little Good News (Capitol, 1983) and Heart Over Mind (Capitol, 1984), both of which won CMA awards. A Little Good News marked the first time that the CMA Album of the Year award had been won by a solo female act.\nWhile Norman had been known for providing arrangements and keyboards on albums that typified the lush, Californian sound of the seventies, as a producer his natural inclination towards country music became increasingly prominent through his work with such artists as Kenny Rogers, Hank Williams Jr., Crystal Gayle, Michael Martin Murphey, BJ Thomas, Mark O'Connor, Victoria Shaw, Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee, John Anderson, TG Sheppard, Gary Morris, Clay Walker, Pinkard & Bowden, Mac McAnally and Brenda Lee among others.

From 1971 to 1975, he served as Prime Minister of South Korea. He assumed the same position from 1998 to 2000 during Kim Dae-jung's presidency as part of the Alliance DJP.\nIn 1987, Kim Jong-pil staged a political comeback by creating a new political party known as the New Democratic Republican Party (NDRP).

Key members included Choi Gak-kyu, Kim Dong Kun (\uae40\ub3d9\uadfc (1930)), Koo Ja-choon, Lee Hee-il, Kim Yong-tae, Cho Yong-jik, Kim Yong-hwan, Kim Moon-won, etc. As chairman of the NDRP, he ran for president and lost to Roh Tae-woo of the ruling Democratic Justice Party (DJP). In the 13th National Assembly legislative elections held in April 1988, the NDRP won 35 seats out of the 299-seat National Assembly.\nIn January 1990, Kim Jong-pil led the merger of his party with the ruling DJP and opposition party, Kim Young-sam\u2019s Reunification Democratic Party (RDP) to create the Democratic Liberal Party (DLP).

Scholars note that he mastered the art of political coalitions. This is demonstrated in the way he was able to reemerge politically stronger after suffering various political setbacks. For instance, by October 1997, Kim Jong-pil's popularity had fluctuated, hovering between 2.9 percent and 4.6 percent, which was attributed to his reputation as being an integral member of the authoritarian rule of Park Chung-hee. part. This was further aggravated by the conservative party's image problem, which was identified with old politicians who have ethical flaws. Also, it is important to note that his main regional power base, the Chungcheon province, lacks the intense and unwavering loyalty to its political 'leaders' that is often found among those from neighbouring regions such as Chollado or Gyeongsangdo provinces.\nThrough clever political maneuvering, however, Kim Jong-pil struck a power-sharing deal with Kim Dae-jung's National Congress for New Politics, known as the DJP Alliance, which allowed him to choose half of the cabinet members of the Kim Dae-Jung administration. The deal also included his appointment as prime minister in March 1998 during Kim Dae-jung's presidency (1998-2003) for the second time.\nIn 2004, he announced his retirement from politics after his bid for a tenth term in the National Assembly failed and his party, the United Liberal Democrats, was unable to gain a sizable number of seats in the 2004 parliamentary election.

This production was revived at the King's Head in 2017; Time Out said of it: \"It captures the original\u2019s sharp subtext, frivolous wit and heavy irony, while also being very, very silly\".The first adaptation for screen was Ken Russell's short (40-minute) film for the BBC film unit in 1964. Russell shot this in the style of the silent films of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, with the text narrated in a voice-over.

As the story became more complex, Moore said Watchmen became about \"power and about the idea of the superman manifest within society.\" The title of the series refers to the question \"Who will watch the watchmen themselves?\", famously posed by the Roman satirist Juvenal (as \"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\"), although Moore was not aware of the phrase's classical origins until Harlan Ellison informed him. Moore commented in 1987, \"In the context of Watchmen, that fits. 'They're watching out for us, who's watching out for them?'\" The writer stated in the introduction to the Graffiti hardcover of Watchmen that while writing the series he was able to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes, and instead he found an interest in real human beings.\nBradford Wright described Watchmen as \"Moore's obituary for the concept of heroes in general and superheroes in particular.\" Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore's \"admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate\". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to \"the Reagans, Thatchers, and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process\". Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be \"not anti-Americanism, [but] anti-Reaganism\", specifically believing that \"at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable.\" Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: \"There's no overt political message at all. It's a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen and if people can see things in it that apply to the real America, then they're reading it into the comic [...].\" While Moore wanted to write about \"power politics\" and the \"worrying\" times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would \"switch off\" if he attacked a leader they admired. Moore stated in 1986 that he \"was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy.\"Citing Watchmen as the point where the comic book medium \"came of age\", Iain Thomson wrote in his essay \"Deconstructing the Hero\" that the story accomplished this by \"developing its heroes precisely in order to deconstruct the very idea of the hero and so encouraging us to reflect upon its significance from the many different angles of the shards left lying on the ground\". Thomson stated that the heroes in Watchmen almost all share a nihilistic outlook, and that Moore presents this outlook \"as the simple, unvarnished truth\" to \"deconstruct the would-be hero's ultimate motivation, namely, to provide a secular salvation and so attain a mortal immortality\". He wrote that the story \"develops its heroes precisely in order to ask us if we would not in fact be better off without heroes\". Thomson added that the story's deconstruction of the hero concept \"suggests that perhaps the time for heroes has passed\", which he feels distinguishes \"this postmodern work\" from the deconstructions of the hero in the existentialism movement. Richard Reynolds states that without any supervillains in the story, the superheroes of Watchmen are forced to confront \"more intangible social and moral concerns\", adding that this removes the superhero concept from the normal narrative expectations of the genre. Reynolds concludes that the series' ironic self-awareness of the genre \"all mark out Watchmen either as the last key superhero text, or the first in a new maturity of the genre\".Geoff Klock eschewed the term \"deconstruction\" in favor of describing Watchmen as a \"revisionary superhero narrative\". He considers Watchmen and Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns to be \"the first instances [...] of [a] new kind of comic book [...] a first phase of development, the transition of the superhero from fantasy to literature.\" He elaborates by noting that \"Alan Moore's realism [...] performs a kenosis towards comic book history [...] [which] does not ennoble and empower his characters [...] Rather, it sends a wave of disruption back through superhero history [...] devalue[ing] one of the basic superhero conventions by placing his masked crime fighters in a realistic world\". First and foremost, \"Moore's exploration of the [often compromised] motives for costumed crimefighting sheds a disturbing light on past superhero stories, and forces the reader to reevaluate\u2014to revision\u2014every superhero in terms of Moore's kenosis\u2014his emptying out of the tradition\". Klock relates the title to the quote by Juvenal to highlight the problem of controlling those who hold power and quoted repeatedly within the work itself. The deconstructive nature of Watchmen is, Klock notes, played out on the page also as, \"[l]ike Alan Moore's kenosis, [Veidt] must destroy, then reconstruct, in order to build 'a unity which would survive him.'\"Moore has expressed dismay that \"[t]he gritty, deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic, as exemplified by Watchmen [...] became a genre\". He said in 2003 that \"to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since Watchmen, an awful lot of the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use Watchmen to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don't have a lot to recommend them\". Gibbons said that while readers \"were left with the idea that it was a grim and gritty kind of thing\", he said in his view the series was \"a wonderful celebration of superheroes as much as anything else\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is that \u201cwhereby something is effected and thus attained.\u201d In essence, it can be seen as a cause, for \u201cWhatever has an effect as its consequence is called a cause.\u201d But an end is also a cause to the extent that it determines the kind of means to be used to actualize it. As noted, \u201cThe end in keeping with which the kind of means to be used is determined is also considered a cause.\u201d This conceptualization of instrumentality as means and ends leads the question further into causality, suggesting that \u201c[w]herever ends are pursued and means are employed, wherever instrumentality reigns, there reigns causality.\u201dTo question causality, Heidegger starts from what \u201c[f]or centuries philosophy has taught\u201d regarding the traditional \"four causes.\u201d These are traditionally enumerated as (1) the \u201ccausa materialis, the material, the matter out of which\" something is made; (2) the \u201ccausa formalis, the form, the shape into which the material enters\u201d; (3) the \u201ccausa finalis, the end, in relation to which [the thing] required is determined as to its form and matter\"; and (4) the \"causa efficiens, which brings about the effect that is the finished [thing].\u201d Heidegger concludes that \u201c[w]hat technology is, when represented as a means, discloses itself when we trace instrumentality back to fourfold causality.\" To explain this, Heidegger uses the example of a silver chalice. Each element works together to create the chalice in a different manner:\n\nThus four ways of owing hold sway in the sacrificial vessel that lies ready before us. They differ from one another, yet they belong together. ... The four ways of being responsible bring something into appearance. They let it come forth into presencing. They set it free to that place and so start it on its way, namely into its complete arrival.\nWhen these four elements work together to create something into appearance, it is called bringing-forth. This bringing-forth comes from the Greek poiesis, which \"brings out of concealment into unconcealment.\" This revealing can be represented by the Greek word aletheia, which in English is translated as \"truth.\" This truth has everything to do with the essence of technology because technology is a means of revealing the truth.Modern technology, however, differs from poiesis. Heidegger suggests that this difference stems from the fact that modern technology \"is based on modern physics as an exact science.\" The revealing of modern technology, therefore, is not bringing-forth, but rather challenging-forth. To exemplify this, Heidegger draws on the Rhine River as an example of how our modern technology can change a cultural symbol.To further his discussion of modern technology, Heidegger introduces the notion of standing-reserve. Modern technology places humans in standing-reserve. To explain this, Heidegger uses the example of a forester and his relationship to the paper and print industries, as he waits in standing reserve for their wishes.Heidegger once again returns to discuss the essence of modern technology to name it Gestell, which he defines primarily as a sort of enframing:\n\nEnframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon that sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing that holds sway in the essence of modern technology and that it is itself not technological.\nOnce he has discussed enframing, Heidegger highlights the threat of technology. As he states, this threat \"does not come in the first instance from the potentially lethal machines and apparatus of technology.\" Rather, the threat is the essence because \"the rule of enframing threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to enter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth.\" This is because challenging-forth conceals the process of bringing-forth, which means that truth itself is concealed and no longer unrevealed. Unless humanity makes an effort to re-orient itself, it will not be able to find revealing and truth.\nIt is at this point that Heidegger has encountered a paradox: humanity must be able to navigate the dangerous orientation of enframing because it is in this dangerous orientation that we find the potential to be rescued. To further elaborate on this, Heidegger returns to his discussion of essence. Ultimately, he concludes that \"the essence of technology is in a lofty sense ambiguous\" and that \"such ambiguity points to the mystery of all revealing, i.e., of truth.\"The question concerning technology, Heidegger concludes, is one \"concerning the constellation in which revealing and concealing, in which the coming to presence of the truth comes to pass.\" In other words, it is finding truth. Heidegger presents art as a way to navigate this constellation, this paradox, because the artist, or the poet as Heidegger suggests, views the world as it is and as it reveals itself.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When he was 19, Shrieve jammed with Santana at a recording studio and was invited to join that day.On August 16, 1969, Santana played the Woodstock Festival, shortly after Shrieve's twentieth birthday, but before the release of their eponymous first album (1969).

The whole of traditional price theory is covered in one chapter \u2026 [some] prices are formed by conventional mark-ups on prime costs, the level of the mark-up itself being left unexplained. Apart from this chapter, the book is doggedly macro-economic in treatment \u2026 A striking omission from the book is any mention of the closely related concepts of externalities and public goods, which most economists would nowadays regard as the basic ingredients of \u201cmarket failure\u201d that has come to be fruitfully applied \u2026 to problems of pollution and congestion.\u2019 (Blaug, 1974, pp. 71-2)\n\u2018Nothing is more difficult than to turn and entire discipline around, asking itself to jettison its own history over the last 200 years.\u2019 Blaug (1990, p. 205).\n\u2018Despite entries on socialism, socialist economics and market socialism, and biographical entries on Oskar Lange and Ludwig von Mises, the Socialist Calculation Debate, so crucial in the revival of general equilibrium theory and the rise of modern welfare economics in the 1930s, is nowhere discussed at length in The New Palgrave.\u2019 Blaug (1990, p. 236). \n\u2018The history of economic thought is irrepressible. It would survive even if it were banned \u2026 it would be carried on in secret in underground organizations. Many economists denigrate the history of economics as mere antiquarianism but, in fact, they have deluded ideas about the history of their own subject. After all, whenever anyone has a new idea in economics, whenever anyone hankers to start a new movement or school of thought, what is the first thing he or she does? Why, it is to rummage the attic of past ideas to establish an appropriate pedigree for the new departure. \u2026 Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Marshall and Keynes all drew on the history of economics to show that they had predecessors and forerunners; even Milton Friedman, when he launched the monetarist counterrevolution against Keynes, could not resist the temptation to quote David Hume over and again. The history of economic thought cannot be abolished and, were its study declared illegal, it would be studied in basements behind locked doors.\u2019 (\u2018Introduction\u2019, to Blaug, M. (ed.) (1991) The Historiography of Economics (Aldershot: Edward Elgar), p. x.)\n\u2018Modern Austrian economists go so far as to suggest that the Walrasian approach to the problem of multimarket equilibrium is a cul de sac: if we want to understand the process of competition, rather than the equilibrium end-state achieved by competition, we must begin by discarding such static reasoning as is implied by Walrasian GE theory. I have come slowly and extremely reluctantly to the view that they are right and that we have all been wrong\u2019 Mark Blaug (1991, pg. 508)\n\u2018The Lange idea of managers following marginal cost-pricing rules because they are instructed to do so, while the central planning board continually alters the prices of both producer and consumer goods so as to reduce their excess demands to zero, is so administratively naive as to be positively laughable. Only those drunk on perfectly competitive, static equilibrium theory could have swallowed such nonsense. ... in all the recent calls for reform of Soviet bloc economies, no one has ever suggested that Lange was of any relevance whatsoever. And still more ironically, Lange\u2019s \u201cmarket socialism\u201d is, on its own grounds, socialism without anything that can be called market transactions.\u2019 Mark Blaug (1993) Review of David R.

Economists have gradually converted the subject into a sort of social mathematics in which analytical rigor as understood in math departments is everything and empirical relevance (as understood in physics departments) is nothing. If a topic cannot be tackled by formal modelling, it is simply consigned to the intellectual underworld. To pick up a copy of American Economic Review or Economic Journal, not to mention Econometrica or Review of Economic Studies these days is to wonder whether one has landed on a strange planet in which tedium is the deliberate objective of professional publication.

In this album, McCleary has chosen some of the most loved songs from the 50s, 60s and 70s and reinterpreted them with jazzy, seductive and mischievous flare using various genres and a predominantly live band feel. McCleary has been quoted saying, 'A beautiful song is like a beautiful woman. The musical arrangements are like the clothes that she wears. The music recordings, much like clothes, may appear old and outdated to the younger generation, but the beauty of the song composition and lyrics are eternal. My goal is to give that beautiful song new clothes that suit and enhance her beauty for all to see afresh and enjoy. I personally also still love listening to the old recordings.'\nThe Bartender as an artist includes Suman Sridhar, Shalmali Kholgade, Shibani Dandekar, Rachel Varghese, Saba Azad and Mauli Dave on vocals, Vinay Lobo on guitar, Aditya Ashok on drums, Anand Bhagat on percussions, Ramon Ibrahim on keyboards, Rhys D'Souza on saxophone, Kishore Sodha on trumpet and Mikey McCleary on bass.

The series revolves around the lives of Bernard, Manny and Fran. Bernard's persona of a grouchy and misanthropic shopkeeper is a central theme; he has a hatred of the outside world and all the people who inhabit it, except for his best friend, Fran, who initially runs a trendy bric-a-brac shop, Nifty Gifty, next door to the bookshop.\nBernard displays little interest or knowledge in retail (or, indeed, anything outside drinking, smoking and reading) and actively avoids having to interact with anyone, even inside his shop, as he has a seething dislike towards his customers who treat his bookshop more like a personal library.  He would often rather pass up on a sale than have to engage in human interaction to make one. It is suggested that Fran and Bernard once slept together, but now they remain content to be friends (or possibly with Fran not allowing Bernard to remember), sharing a love of smoking heavily and drinking to excess. Fran otherwise is a hopeless romantic.\nManny is introduced in the first episode as an angst-ridden accountant who enters the bookshop seeking The Little Book of Calm. During a drunken night out, Bernard offers him a job as a shop assistant and a room above the shop if he will do Bernard's accounts for him. Sobering up, Bernard realises Manny's optimistic nature is not suited to this \"kind of operation\". Fran, however, seeing that Manny is good for Bernard, forces Bernard to let him stay.\nMany episodes are driven by Manny and Fran's attempts to force Bernard into a more socially acceptable lifestyle. Their efforts usually result in chaos, sucking them back into Bernard's cynical view of the world. The bookshop, which also doubles as Manny and Bernard's residence, is frequently depicted as being in an unlivable state of dirtiness and often inhabited by animals and other unidentified creatures, while disorder is a frequent aspect of the running of the shop. Manny's attempts to improve both the shop and the residence often fail.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After being diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, Vicki faced the hard choice of leaving Homicide Division in the police department and working a desk job or leaving the police force altogether. Despite strong protests from her partner and lover, Detective Mike Celluci, she decided to leave the force and open a private investigation firm.\nThough her vision does prove to be a problem at times, Vicki refuses to let anyone treat her like she is disabled and continues to take risks with her life throughout the course of her investigations. As a result of leaving the force, her relationship with Celluci has become on-again/off-again. Meanwhile, her growing attraction to Henry only fuels the complications in her love life, putting her in the center of a supernatural love triangle.\nHenry Fitzroy\n(b. June 15, 1519 d. June 18, 1536 reborn June 19, 1536) Based on the historical character Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset - the illegitimate son of Henry VIII of England, Henry Fitzroy chose love over familial duty and sacrificed his mortal life to remain forever with the woman he loved; Christina.  Vampiric circumstances, however, prevented him from remaining with her and now, after 470 years of existence, he is living in Toronto as a graphic novelist (a.k.a. comic book artist)- \"Art and literature have always been my passions.  I finally found a medium where I could fully realize the both of them.\"  His quiet, hidden life takes on a new twist when he collides with Vicki Nelson in an attempt to stop a man from bringing the demon Asteroth into the mortal world. As they work to solve this case, and subsequently other supernatural problems, Henry grows deeply attracted to Vicki's willful nature and exuberance for life, eventually falling for her. Though she seems to resist his advances, he continues to pursue her and, mostly due to his centuries of experience and knowledge of both sides of the supernatural, he becomes Vicki's partner and bodyguard.\nDetective Mike Celluci\nVicki's former partner, as well as on/off lover, he was very much against her decision to leave the force. He and Vicki share many personality traits, which often results in arguments between the two. Yet despite (or perhaps because of) this they are firm friends, both going so far as to discuss their current cases. As straight as they come, and a \"see it to believe it\" kind of guy to boot, Mike often exhibits concern over the kind of cases Vicki seems willing to take on in her new career. He has trouble accepting Vicki's friendship and trust in Henry, even more so once he finds out what Henry is, often coming across as jealous. However, they have been known to work together on occasion - especially when it is Vicki who needs help.\nCoreen Fennel\nCoreen becomes known to Vicki during her first \"unusual\" case, hiring her to find out who killed her boyfriend. Once the case was over, she managed to insinuate herself into the position of Vicki's office assistant. Coreen appears to have extensive knowledge about the occult, and is certainly far more curious and accepting of it than any of the other characters. Because of this, she seems to have struck up a friendship with Dr. Sagara, a professor of the occult known to Henry, and the two can occasionally be seen working together on a case for Vicki. Coreen can at times serve as an emissary between Vicki and Mike, usually trying to get Vicki talking with him again. It was shown various times that she may have a crush on Henry, most prominently when first meeting him. However, when the two rarely work together, Coreen's lingering looks may suggest that she has a crush on him or it may be the way Henry naturally attracts women. This character does not appear in the books beyond the \"client\" role she originated in the first episode, and it has been suggested that she \"replaced\" the character of Tony. Several sources cite the omission of Tony as being due to copyright reasons in that the rights to the series of books that feature Tony are owned by another network.

Dowding is best known for his work on \"power\", applying insights from formal analysis to central debates on the nature of power and structure of power in society. Expanding on Brian Barry's concept of \"luck\" (getting what you want without trying) he argues that some groups of people are \"systematically lucky\" in that they are advantaged because of the way society is structured. Such people are not powerful in the sense they have resources that they could use that other groups do not (though they might have this power as well) but rather systematically lucky in that they tend to get what they want without having to do anything. Alternatively, other groups are systematically unlucky. This argument has caused great controversy with critics including Brian Barry, Steven Lukes, Peter Morriss and more recently Andrew Hindmoor.Dowding has also worked on the Tiebout model of individuals moving location to get the local services they require, showing that such moving does occur in the UK though only to a small extent, and that people tend to move to areas for service reasons, but do not decide to leave from areas for those reasons. He has extended this work into examining Albert Hirschman's Exit, Voice and Loyalty Model and has a forthcoming Cambridge University Press book Exits, Voices and Social Investment co-authored with long-time collaborator Peter John extending and applying Hirschman's model to citizen satisfaction with government services.\nDowding also considered the theory of presidentialisation of British politics in his 2012 article, \u201cThe Prime Ministerialization of the British Prime Minister\u201d. The article challenges Michael Foley\u2019s theory that British politics is becoming increasingly similar to that of a presidential system. Dowding instead suggests that the British prime minister is gaining power, but only enhancing the responsibilities that he already possesses rather than adopting new powers that are more closely attributed to the United States\u2019 President.\nMore recently his work has examined why UK cabinet ministers resign based on a large dataset of all UK ministerial resignations and non-resignations, and compiled another on Australia.

It is one about all of us, about Farida and Amin and our parents, and about Jamila. It is about how one story contains many and how they belong not to us but are part of the random currents of our time, and about how stories capture us and entangle us for all time.\n\nThe novel is narrated by Rashid in all but one of the ten chapters, which exception is drawn from the notebooks of his brother Amin. Rashid is the youngest child of teaching parents: he is two years younger than Amin, who is in turn two years younger than Farida, their sister. The children are brought up in Zanzibar late in 1950s, during a time of heady transition from colonialism to independence.\nRashid spins two tales: one is in part his own, and largely contingent on the other, set some fifty years thence on the outskirts of a small town in colonial Kenya, along the east African coast north of Mombasa, when early one morning in 1899 an Englishman stumbles out of the desert and collapses before a local shopkeeper outside his mosque.  The latter, Hassanali, takes him back home and, amidst the considerable kerfuffle, and with some help from family and local professionals, begins nursing the man back to health.\nHassanali is a nervous, superstitious, cowardly man. On first being approached by the almost lifeless Pearce, he mistakes him for a ghoulish genie come to spirit his soul away.\nBefore long, an English district officer, one Frederick Turner, arrives on the scene.  He accuses Hassanali of having stolen whatever goods the Englishman brought with him, and promptly conveys him back to the residency.  The traveller's name, as it turns out, is Martin Pearce, a man of liberal thought and broad linguistic knowledge, and something of an \"Orientalist\".  During his convalescence with Turner, he begins quickly to feel guilty about the harsh treatment and false accusations levelled at his original saviours, for he genuinely arrived with almost nothing but the clothes on his back: the only item he seems to have lost is his notebook.  On visiting the shopkeeper to apologise, he sees Rehana, Hassanali's sister, and falls for her immediately.\nRehana's father was an Indian trader who settled in Mombasa and married a local woman, but the family is now part of the \"Arabised minority\" in a town still fresh with the memory of its years of slavery under the sultan.\nThe subsequent relationship between Rehana and Pearce is, of course, a scandal.  Rashid in his narrative admits that it is difficult to say how it came about, if less so to figure out how it was discovered.  The upshot is that Rehana is forced to vacate the town and take up lodgings elsewhere with Pearce.\nHalf a century later, Amin, Rashid and Farida are growing up and receiving a typical colonial education in pre-independent Zanzibar.  Amin, like his parents, is to train to become a schoolteacher; Rashid is studying for Oxbridge; and Farida, an academic failure, becomes the family housekeep and small-business dressmaker to the young women of the town.  One of her clients is a beautiful woman named Jamila, granddaughter of Rehana and Pearce.  Despite her lowly repute \"as a divorced woman whose grandmother slept with mzungus  [sic]\", Amin falls in love with her, and she with him.  His parents are outraged on discovering the secret and refuse to brook it:\n\nDo you know who she is?  Do you know what kind of people they are?  Her grandmother was a chotara, a child of sin by an Indian man, a bastard.  When she grew into a woman, she was the mistress of an Englishman for many years, and before that another mzungu gave her a child of sin too, her own bastard.  That was her life, living dirty with European men [....  T]hey are a rich family so they don't care what anybody thinks.  They've always done as they wished.  This woman that you say you love, she is like her grandmother, living a life of secrets and sin.  She has been married and divorced already.  No one knows where she comes and where she goes, or who she goes to see.  They are not our kind of people.\nAmin is made to promise never to see her again, and he never really does.  He fears for the rest of his life that she thinks he has deserted her.\nIn the case of Rashid, meanwhile, it is his passionate book-learning that results in his desertion first of his home and eventually \"of the entire culture\": \"The place was stifling him, he said: the social obsequiousness, the medieval religiosity, the historical mendacities.\"After independence and the subsequent revolution, life for all the characters is altered completely.  Rashid misses the socio-political turmoil back home in his isolation as a university student in England; in fact, he never sees his ailing, tragic family again.  Although he keeps up a steady stream of correspondence, this becomes increasingly strained with the preterition of time and the need for caution engendered of a brutal and dictatorial government.  His only knowledge of the situation is gleaned from the letters and a few allusive snippets of news.\nBoth Ma and Amin lose their sight, and the former's death is celebrated as having put her out of her mounting misery.  Years later, Rashid is able to piece the story together using Amin's notebooks, his own memory and a chance encounter with another of Pearce's descendants.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to a contemporary review from the Los Angeles Times, the band attracted \"a cream crop of Sunset Strip celebrities who came to judge the change.\" The shows were, in Spevack's words, \"remarkably successful by all accounts\", and received rave reviews from the local press. Digby Diehl of the Times referred to the band's sound as \"a hypnotic m\u00e9lange\" and further wrote that: \"The flute and harpsichord jazz improvisations on numbers such as 'Stephanie Knows Who' and 'Orange Skies' lend a fresh lift to what might be an ordinary rock piece.\" A later review from the paper placed the band's \"clean\" presentation and \"balance of instruments and roles\" with those of the Beatles and Buffalo Springfield. Echols remembered the band's performances with the expanded lineup as \"probably the most fun we had playing.\"Da Capo was first announced as an album on November 12, 1966, with an advertisement placed by Elektra on page 1 of Billboard magazine. By late January 1967 when Da Capo was listed by Billboard as a \"New Action Album\", \"7 and 7 Is\" had already received commercial and critical success, helping to boost the album's sales. It entered the Billboard Top LPs chart on February 11, 1967, and peaked at number 80 on April 8, failing to achieve the commercial success the band had hoped it would. Lee blamed the album's disappointing performance on Elektra, but Botnick disagreed, saying, \"Arthur wouldn't go out and promote it!\" Stuart later reflected that the band \"should have toured behind it\"; however, he recognized that Lee \"prided himself on being different. If bands toured after releasing an album, he would do it differently.\" Regarding the album as \"an undeniably groundbreaking release for 1966\" with a style that had \"no other context or reference in [rock] up to that point\", Einarson asks if Lee had \"overestimated his own audience with a body of music perhaps too complex and esoteric for their tastes\". In the observation of writer Jim Bickhart, \"by that point, Arthur had shown he was kind of oblivious to who his audience was and how to appeal to them ... he was not thinking, 'I'm going to bring my audience along with me,' he was just thinking, 'I'm going to do what I'm going to do.'\"Da Capo received favorable recognition from contemporary reviewers. David Harris of Mojo-Navigator called it \"a great advance\" over Love's debut album and recognized their \"integration of jazz and [rock] into a new form of music.\" In a more critical review for Esquire magazine, Robert Christgau felt that, although \"7 and 7 Is\" was a \"perfect rocker\", the rest of side one \"sounds cluttered and lacks sock\", directing the latter criticism to Lee's voice being \"more often too sweet for his material.\" Of \"Revelation\", Christgau wrote: \"It includes excellent guitar and harmonica work and great screaming ... It also includes some mediocre alto sax and (I shudder) a protracted drum solo.

His title F\u00fcrst, means he is a prince, but neither the anime nor the manga show that he is really royalty and therefore suggest he is the ruler of a \"principality\" royal and noble ranks as in German custom. Orphe is not the son of a king called a \"Prinz\" (prince) in German he is called \"F\u00fcrst\"(prince)indicating his place as the first of his house, as his parents do not appear and he is the presumed head and \"first\" of his house.

Orphe was devastated after her death, and has the habit of caressing the pendant that Robertine's fianc\u00e9 gave her and which Orphe took from the rubble of the explosion site. He blames himself for not accompanying her to buy the wedding dress, despite the fact that she insisted on going alone.Orphe is a very idealistic person.

According to his way of thinking it can be said that he is also an idealist. He likes politics and holds women in higher regards than most of the men in his time. He's prone to winning and strives to excel in everything he does. He decided to become a Strahl candidate after meeting the king as a boy.Eduard Markgraf von Sekt nahe Braunschweig (\u30a8\u30c9\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30c9)Voiced by: Tomokazu Seki, Drama voice by: Shotaro Morikubo\n\nEduard is nicknamed \"Ed\" by most of the people around him. His title, Markgraf means Marquis. His father had an illegal affair with a woman of a lower rank, resulting in Ed and Erika (Ed's little sister). After his mother died, his father took him into his house. However, he was already married with three girls, all of whom were older than Ed. Henriette Braunschweig, Ed's stepmother, hated Ed because she wasn't able to give birth to a male heir to the Braunschweig family assets, going as far as telling her daughters not to speak with their two half siblings. Eventually Ed's father had Erika removed from the house to appease his wife, and her whereabouts are unknown. Ed is still burdened by this because he had promised his sister that he would protect her, and was unable to fulfill that promise.Ed's appearance is unlike that of the other nobles in the series. He goes with his neck uncovered, he is more tanned than the others and has an earring. Ed is very cheerful and likes to take things easy. He is also the comic relief throughout the series, with his attempts at meditation and kendo. He makes friends easily and wears his heart on his sleeve, though he does not care what other people think about him. He is a good swordsman but is not above using his fists in a fight, another thing that distinguishes him from the other nobles.Ludwig Herzog von Mohn nahe Liechtenstein (\u30eb\u30fc\u30c9\u30f4\u30a3\u30c3\u30d2)Voiced by: Toshihiko Seki, Drama voice by: Akira Ishida\n\nLudwig is often nicknamed as Lui by the people around him, though most still refer to him as Ludwig because they are afraid of him or revere him. His title Herzog is the second highest title among the nobles, and means Duke. His father is a Duke as well, but his mother is the king's sister, making the king of Kuchen his uncle. His other uncle on his mother's side is the king's (rebellious) younger brother, Helbert. His uncle on his father's side is Camus' father, making the two of them cousins. It is known that he has two housekeepers named Augusta and Clemence, a younger sister and a younger brother. Also, he is left-handed.Lui appears cold-hearted most of the time. He is very arrogant and yet he knows what is expected of him by his rank and position in the world of those times, and accepts it with cold indifference. He often leaves his friend shocked at his words when he voices his thoughts. However, Lui is a good judge of character and seems to know what to say to help the people he is fond of in order to solve problems on their own. He likes challenges, as long as they are fair towards both ends. Lui claims that he is not like the others, insinuating that he is cold hearted and calculated, and compares himself to Orphe by saying that he can not grasp an opportunity and fight for it like Orphe does. Isaac reprimands Lui for his way of thinking, claiming that it was too dangerous.Camus Pfalzgraf von Silvaner L\u00fcneburg (\u30ab\u30df\u30e6)Voiced by: Soichiro Hoshi, Drama voice by: K\u014dki Miyata\n\nCamus does not have a nickname like the others, but due to Japanese pronunciation it is often thought that he is nicknamed \"Camu\", however that is not so. Camus\u2019 rank of Pfalzgraf is the lowest of the nobles and means Count palatine. Camus has an elder sister and an elder brother named Leohart, who is especially protective of him and has watched over him ever since the day he was born.Camus possesses a special ability, something akin to empathy. He is able to talk to flowers and under his care they bloom more wildly than any place else (his mansion consists of huge gardens that he tend to himself). This ability also enables him to tell a person\u2019s mood. He can tell when someone is upset or angry, like he knew that Isaac was angry at the Strahl class when he visited the academy even though Isaac was smiling. He also receives visions of future events, but when he warns the people involved he is usually feared instead of heeded. Due to this ability he is often feared, misunderstood or mocked.Naoji Ishizuki (\u77f3\u6708\u30ca\u30aa\u30b8)Voiced by: Akira Ishida, Drama voice by: Tomokazu Sugita\n\nNaoji is the only one who does not have a rank, and is in fact not a noble. Naoji was born in Japan to a prestigious family. His father sent him to Kuchen to turn him into an educated and experienced man, but also to protect him from the impending war in Japan (World War II). Without his knowledge, a Kuchen citizenship application was submitted in his name by his father, something he is very upset over. He is staying with a man named Foster, who was like a father to Naoji\u2019s mother.Naoji has a younger sister, a grandfather and a non-Japanese grandmother. His grandmother was born in Kuchen to a Dukedom and was described to be a true lady with perfect education. She met Naoji\u2019s grandfather when he was studying abroad and all but eloped with him to Japan. Throughout the anime series, Naoji is the only one who speaks the common Japanese dialect, while the rest of the characters speak in an extremely polite and somewhat archaic dialect to distinguish between them.Isaac Cavendish (\u30a2\u30a4\u30b6\u30c3\u30af)Voiced by: Takehito Koyasu\n\nIsaac is a British spy who works undercover in Kuchen. Since Kuchen insisted on remaining neutral despite the time and era being just between two world wars, the British government wanted to know if Kuchen can be influenced (by force if necessary) to support their side. So Isaac is sent, and for nearly a year he works in Kuchen in the disguise of an author, though he is not the only secret agent who works undercover in Kuchen.Isaac actually received the title \"Sir\" for his service to his country. His parents were fallen noblemen that, due to poverty, were thrown out of their manor, something that affected his sister very much. He has three younger siblings: a sister named Rosa and two younger brothers. At some point after they were thrown out of their manor Isaac was left to take care of his younger siblings and was separated from his parents. He joined the army to earn money and support the family during World War I (he calls that time \"hell\"), and due to his outstanding conduct in battle was recruited to the secret services.Isaac has a motorcycle and usually carries a revolver.

Some of his works were banned by the Soviet government, but because folk music was fundamental to his style most of his compositions were accepted by the censors.\nMore recently, Tormis' works have been performed and recorded by T\u00f5nu Kaljuste with the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, and others. In the 1990s, Tormis began to receive commissions from some a cappella groups as the King's Singers and the Hilliard Ensemble.\nTormis famously said of his settings of traditional melodies and verse: \"It is not I who makes use of folk music, it is folk music that makes use of me.\" His work demonstrates his conviction that traditional Estonian and other Balto-Finnic music represents a treasure which must be guarded and nourished, and that culture may be kept alive through the medium of song.", "hasanswer": true}]}

In the early years of her marriage, Sophie faced public scrutiny for her business interests, and was often compared to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, who had died two years earlier. On her transition to becoming a full-time royal, she later stated: \"Certainly it took me a while to find my feet. The frustration was I had to reduce my expectations of what I could actually do. I couldn't turn up at a charity and go, right, I think you should be doing this, because that's what I was used to doing in my working life. I had to take a really big step back and go, OK, they want you to be the icing on the cake, the person to come in to thank their volunteers and funders, not necessarily to tell them how to run their communications plan.\"Sophie has since been cited as an under-the-radar \"stabilizing influence\" and a \"safe pair of hands\". She has been said to have a low-key approach to royal engagements, and often drives herself to and from events. Amanda Pullinger stated to Town and Country, \"She actually presents herself as an ordinary person and I think that is increasingly what the royal family needs to do.\" She has also been noted for her long-term work on \"gritty\" subject matters such as gender-based violence in conflict, and trips to \"difficult areas\", such as South Sudan and Sierra Leone. The Countess's engagements gained significant attention from the public post-Megxit, with her charity work and style choices receiving increased commentary and analysis. Writer Ingrid Seward states that Sophie \"is not a self-publicist....She looks good, without being over-the-top, and she's not craving celebrity. You often wouldn't know she had carried out all those engagements.\"Sophie was not initially prominent for her fashion, but eventually began to develop her own style and has worn outfits by many notable designers. She has exclusively worn Jane Taylor millinery designs since 2009 on numerous occasions. In a Marie Claire interview, Taylor described her first royal commission: \"My first royal client was the Countess of Wessex, and it was quite nerve-racking. But she wears such lovely clothes and she always looks so fabulous, so it's quite easy to design for her. Since she came to see me, she's never worn any other milliner's hats, which is a big compliment. I was really excited, honored, and slightly nervous.\" Alongside the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Sussex, Sophie has been named one of the most stylish members of the royal family. Sophie is particularly known for wearing different combinations of hats and coats, and favours silk dresses and frocks. Describing her style in an interview by Sunday Express Sophie said: \"It's about my charities, but I recognize that I'm on display. [...] When you walk into a room, yes, people are going to talk about what you're doing there, but they're also going to want to know what you're wearing\".

One of these involved the murder of a bank-teller, George Gordon. The murderer got away with $130,000. Pinkerton determined that Gordon was fetching money for a friend or someone who frequented the bank when he was struck on the head behind the ear with a hammer with intent to murder any witnesses of the robbery. Through his investigation, Pinkerton felt certain that his prime suspect, Alexander P. Drysdale, had in fact killed Gordon. However, at this point he did not have enough hard evidence to convict Drysdale; too much was still based on speculation. Therefore, he set a trap for Drysdale so that he would reveal a confession. Warne was sent undercover as a Mrs. Potter and became close friends with Mr. Drysdale's wife. Through this plot, they were able to uncover where Drysdale had hidden the stolen money.Another case for which Kate Warne went undercover was brought about by a Captain Sumner, who was convinced that both his sister, Mrs. Annie Thayer, and a Mr. Pattmore, were attempting to poison Mrs. Pattmore and himself. Warne took the name Lucille and assumed the role of a fortune teller to lure information out of the suspected murderer's confidants. In the meantime, she also continually coordinated Pinkerton's other female detectives in the agency. Pinkerton rented a space for Warne to work as part of her guise. Allan Pinkerton named Kate Warne one of the five best detectives that he had. Her employment by Pinkerton was a significant moment in Women's History. Women were not allowed to be a part of the police force until 1891 and could not be officers until 1908.Pinkerton specifically thanked Kate Warne and Timothy Webster in his memoirs. Both Warne and Webster were key operatives during the Baltimore Plot investigations. Warne reported back to Pinkerton about all her work when he was away from the office and they worked together, on numerous cases, during their tenure. Pinkerton constantly showed a deep trust in the work that Warne performed and acknowledges so in his memoirs. She was in charge of the Female Detective Bureau established by Pinkerton, her title being Supervisor of Women Agents. Pinkerton said to his female prospective agents that they would serve their children \"better than on the field,\" and added he had \"several female operatives,\" supporting his case by noting, \"if you agree to come aboard you will go in training with the head of my female detectives, Kate Warne. She has never let me down.Since the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed many of the unpublished records of Pinkerton detective agency, little of her life beyond Pinkerton's words, which detailed cases his agency solved is known. Erin Allen, who managed the Library of Congress blog, called Warne an \"intriguing figure\" and speculated that little documentation remains \"because she was a good spy.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, he was the first to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand. Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any. Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m), \"the hand and feet bones indicated delicate and well-shaped hands and feet, with tapering fingers and a narrow foot\".Anne Boleyn was described by contemporaries as intelligent and gifted in musical arts and scholarly pursuits. She was also strong-willed and proud, and often quarrelled with Henry. Biographer Eric Ives evaluates the apparent contradictions in Anne's persona:\n\nTo us she appears inconsistent\u2014religious yet aggressive, calculating yet emotional, with the light touch of the courtier yet the strong grip of the politician\u2014but is this what she was, or merely what we strain to see through the opacity of the evidence? As for her inner life, short of a miraculous cache of new material, we shall never really know. Yet what does come to us across the centuries is the impression of a person who is strangely appealing to the early 21st century: A woman in her own right\u2014taken on her own terms in a man's world; a woman who mobilised her education, her style and her presence to outweigh the disadvantages of her sex; of only moderate good looks, but taking a court and a king by storm. Perhaps, in the end, it is Thomas Cromwell's assessment that comes nearest: intelligence, spirit and courage.\nNo contemporary portraits of Anne Boleyn survive. A bust of her was cast on a commemorative medallion in 1534, believed to have been struck to celebrate her second pregnancy.Following the coronation of her daughter as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of John Foxe, who argued that Anne had saved England from the evils of Roman Catholicism and that God had provided proof of her innocence and virtue by making sure her daughter Elizabeth I ascended the throne. An example of Anne's direct influence in the reformed church is what Alexander Ales described to Queen Elizabeth as the \"evangelical bishops whom your holy mother appointed from among those scholars who favoured the purer doctrine\". Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous artistic and cultural works. As a result, she has remained in the popular memory and has been called \"the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Digby Diehl of the Times referred to the band's sound as \"a hypnotic m\u00e9lange\" and further wrote that: \"The flute and harpsichord jazz improvisations on numbers such as 'Stephanie Knows Who' and 'Orange Skies' lend a fresh lift to what might be an ordinary rock piece.\" A later review from the paper placed the band's \"clean\" presentation and \"balance of instruments and roles\" with those of the Beatles and Buffalo Springfield. Echols remembered the band's performances with the expanded lineup as \"probably the most fun we had playing.\"Da Capo was first announced as an album on November 12, 1966, with an advertisement placed by Elektra on page 1 of Billboard magazine.

It entered the Billboard Top LPs chart on February 11, 1967, and peaked at number 80 on April 8, failing to achieve the commercial success the band had hoped it would. Lee blamed the album's disappointing performance on Elektra, but Botnick disagreed, saying, \"Arthur wouldn't go out and promote it!\" Stuart later reflected that the band \"should have toured behind it\"; however, he recognized that Lee \"prided himself on being different. If bands toured after releasing an album, he would do it differently.\" Regarding the album as \"an undeniably groundbreaking release for 1966\" with a style that had \"no other context or reference in [rock] up to that point\", Einarson asks if Lee had \"overestimated his own audience with a body of music perhaps too complex and esoteric for their tastes\". In the observation of writer Jim Bickhart, \"by that point, Arthur had shown he was kind of oblivious to who his audience was and how to appeal to them ... he was not thinking, 'I'm going to bring my audience along with me,' he was just thinking, 'I'm going to do what I'm going to do.'\"Da Capo received favorable recognition from contemporary reviewers. David Harris of Mojo-Navigator called it \"a great advance\" over Love's debut album and recognized their \"integration of jazz and [rock] into a new form of music.\" In a more critical review for Esquire magazine, Robert Christgau felt that, although \"7 and 7 Is\" was a \"perfect rocker\", the rest of side one \"sounds cluttered and lacks sock\", directing the latter criticism to Lee's voice being \"more often too sweet for his material.\" Of \"Revelation\", Christgau wrote: \"It includes excellent guitar and harmonica work and great screaming ...

His father, an army colonel, died penniless in 1834. The boy's education in the Nobility Boarding school at the Saint Petersburg University (1828-1833) was paid for by his uncle on his mother side, Nikolai Khmelnitsky, a well-known playwright of his time. From 1833 to 1847 Durov worked as a civil servant, before retiring and making literature his profession. Most of his works\u2014poems, short stories and novellas\u2014were  published in almanacs, magazines and newspapers from 1843 to 1849, prior to the arrest.In late 1847 Durov began attending Petrashevsky's Fridays. In the spring of 1849, dissatisfied with what he saw as the chaotic nature of these meetings, he\u2014along with his friends Alexander Palm and A.D.Shchelkov\u2014organised another underground circle, which included brothers Fyodor and Mikhail Dostoyevsky, Aleksey Pleshcheyev, Nikolay Speshnev, Nikolai Grigoriev, P.N.Filippov, V.A. Golovinsky and F.N.Lvov. The social and economical situation in Russia was taken as the main issue. Among the documents read there was the banned Belinsky's Letter to Gogol, and \"The Soldier Talk\" (Soldatskaya beseda), the first ever document propagating revolutionary ideas in the Russian army. Four of the circle members, Speshnev, Dostoyevsky, Filippov and Lvov, decided to organize an underground lithograph. Durov disliked the idea and in April 1849 declared his 'evenings' closed.On April 23, 1849, Durov was arrested and spent 8 months in a single camera in the Petropavlovskaya Fortress. Along with the other Petrashevtsy he was taken to the parade ground of the Semionovsky Regiment in Saint Petersburg, and lined up for execution. At the last moment the execution was stopped and it was revealed that his sentence had been commuted to katorga. Durov, along with Fyodor Dostoevsky, was sent in chains to Omsk, where he was to spend 8 years in a convict colony and the rest of his life as a soldier in Siberia.  That sentence was reduced to 4 years as a Prisoner by Nicholas I.  The sentence only commenced when the convicts entered the Prison at Omsk. Dostoyevsky wrote about his experience as a convict in Omsk in his memoir-novel Notes from the House of the Dead.\nAfter Durov's release he spent one year serving in the army as a soldier, then retired due to ill health and settled in Omsk.

His designation as ambassador was mainly because Moscow was interested in increasing the influence of the Finnish Communist Party in Finland.

President Urho Kekkonen invited the counselor Vladimirov to his official residence and reproached him about Belyakov. Vladimirov sent a telegram to Moscow and criticized Belyakov's actions in Finland. Kremlin responded to the telegram by sending the Deputy Foreign Minister Vasili Vasilyevich Kuznetsov to Finland. At a secret meeting, he convinced Kekkonen that the Soviet policy towards Finland hadn't changed and Finland had a right to solve its internal policy alone. After the visit Belyakov started to create contacts outside the Finnish Communist Party, especially with the centre-right National Coalition Party and industrialists and bankers.\nBelyakov's countdown to leaving Finland started at President Kekkonen's dinner party in Kekkonen's official Tamminiemi residence where he was very drunk and behaved badly.

His parents died in his childhood and Legien grew up in an orphanage in Thorn, Province of Prussia (now Toru\u0144) from 1867 to 1875. He became a wood turner and served in the Prussian Army from 1881 to 1884. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1885, a wood turners\u2019 union in 1886 and worked as a turner in several cities in Germany until 1891, since 1886 in Hamburg.In 1887 Legien became the first chairman of the German Association of Turners and of the General Commission of the German Trade Unions (Generalkommission der Gewerkschaften Deutschlands) in 1891, a position he would hold until its dissolution in 1919. He was elected a member of the German Parliament in 1893 (until 1898) and again in 1903 (until his death in 1920). He became the leader of the SPD's right wing and opposed its more leftist factions.He took part in the International Workers Congresses of Paris, 1889.Legien became Chairman of the International Secretariat of National Trade Union Centres in 1903 and first President of the International Federation of Trade Unions in 1913 until its dissolution in 1919.In 1912, Legien gave a keynote address at the convention of the Socialist Party of America in Indianapolis which was credited with persuading the convention to reject the anarcho-syndicalist program of Bill Haywood.\nAt the outbreak of World War I he supported the war with \"patriotic fervor\" and the SPD-majority\u2019s Burgfriedenspolitik, a \"civil truce\", which assured the German government not to \"obstruct the German war effort\". Legien and other leading Social Democrats expected this policy to end the animosity and discrimination of socialist workers in Germany, while the German Empire's government (particularly the War Ministry) evaluated organised labour as an important factor in war industries. As a result, workers became a mobilized, disciplined loyal force in the war effort in return for concessions, and the German labour movement became an obstacle against opposition to war. In the context of the separation of the opposing Social Democratic minority, which led to the foundation of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), Legien and Gustav Bauer declared that the \"Jewish gang\" must be dealt with, in attempt to drive them out of their faction.Robert S. Wistrich classifies Carl Legien as belonging to a group of whom some had antisemitic tendencies.\nDuring the war he worked in variety of ways to help German war effort. He threw down calls from socialists in USA to mediate an end of the war with the German government, while defending the resumption of submarine warfare by German Kriegsmarine as response to the rejection of \"Germany's sincere offer of immediate peace negotiations\"On 15 November 1918 he signed the Stinnes-Legien Agreement with industrialist Hugo Stinnes, an agreement in which the German employers for the first time accepted nationwide unions as legitimate workers-organisations and which introduced an eight-hour day, workers councils in plants with more than 50 employees and parity employment offices. The employers agreed to stop discrimination of union members and their support of \"house unions\" (yellow unions) while the unions rejected radical socialists\u2019 demands. Most of the agreement's regulations became part of the Weimar German constitution.\nIn 1919 he became the first Chairman of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund. \nTo Legien the expected loss of Upper Silesia to Poland after World War I would intensify the 'psychological' impact of the \"draconian peace\" on the German working class.He countered the right-wing Kapp Putsch of March 1920 by organizing a massive general strike in Germany with about 12 million employees following the joint call of the legal government and the unions. The strike immediately halted all production, transportation, mining and public services, it was \"the strongest mass movement the German proletariat ever created\" and \"gave the Kapp r\u00e9gime its death blow\".At that time he declined Friedrich Ebert\u2019s offer to become Chancellor of Germany.Legien died after a short illness in Berlin and was buried at Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde, where his grave now forms part of the Memorial to the Socialists (German: Gedenkst\u00e4tte der Sozialisten).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Andy Gill writes, \"Musically, the songs were completely at odds with what was going on in the rest of the pop world, which during the long, hot summer of 1967 was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of 'psychedelic' music\u2014mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos.\" Patrick Humphries itemizes the ways in which Dylan's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture: \"While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders, Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity. While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While Mick Jagger was 2,000 light years from home, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots.\"This aspect of the basement recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound came as a shock to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, \"Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [Dylan] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar.\" Dylan summed up the gap: \"At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads.\"When the Band began work on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they employed a recording technique similar to the one they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, \"We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique.\" That technique influenced groups including the Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record \"in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that the Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes\".\"Listening to The Basement Tapes now, it seems to be the beginning of what is called Americana or alt.country,\" wrote Billy Bragg. \"The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless\u2014and the best Americana does that as well.\" The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, \"If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts\u2014Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, the Waterboys\u2014have since tried to get back to that place.\"For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes \"sound like they were made in a cardboard box. I think [Dylan] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone. As if they sound like real folk songs\u2014because if you go back into the folk tradition, you will find songs as dark and as deep as these.\"In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked The Basement Tapes number 291 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, number 292 in a 2012 revised list, and number 335 in the magazine's 2020 list. In a special issue devoted to Dylan's work, Q magazine awarded the record five stars, its highest rating, commenting that \"Dylan's work is by turns haunting, hilarious and puzzling\u2014and all of it taps into centuries of American song\".Hip hop group Public Enemy referenced the album in their 2007 Dylan tribute song \"Long and Whining Road\": \"From basement tapes, beyond them dollars and cents / Changing of the guards spent, now where the hell the majors went?\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Even though Juexin is in love with Mei, his cousin, he marries Li Ruijue on the orders of Master Gao after he graduates from middle school. After Juemin escapes from the Gao household, Master Gao asks Juexin to find Juemin. Juexin asks Juehui to help him, but the youngest brother accuses Juexin of being a coward. After learning about Mei's death, Juexin is saddened. Han said that \"[t]he miserable experience\" awakens Juexin, who begins opposing Master Gao.\nMei Han, author of the entry on \"Family\" in The Facts on File Companion to the World Novel: 1900 to the Present, said that Juexin \"is a victim of conservatism\" who is asked to stop observing idealism, loses the women who are dear to him, and \"does nothing but cries in the corner.\" Jin Feng, author of The New Woman in Early Twentieth-Century Chinese Fiction, said that Juexin is \"a character used by a foil to impress upon the reader Juehui's revolutionary courage as compared to people of his own generation and gender.\" Feng added that while Juehui believes that Juexin is a '\"coward who makes \"unnecessary sacrifices\" of himself and the women he loves', Juehui \"cannot help but sympathize with Juexin's dilemma, and in fact often depends on him as a buffer against abuses by their grandfather and uncles.\" Han says that Juexin is also an \"accomplice\" since he helps Master Gao try to find Juemin, and that Juexin \"insists on nonresistance\" despite the fact that he agrees with his brothers. Han argued that Juexin's obedience to the family angers Juehui despite the mercy that Juehui feels for Juexin, \"reflecting the author's own attitude toward\" Juexin.\nGao Juemin (\u9ad8\u89ba\u6c11; \u9ad8\u89c9\u6c11; G\u0101o Ju\u00e9m\u00edn; Kao1 Ch\u00fceh2-min2) - The middle brother.\nJuemin wears glasses. Juemin is in love with Qin, his cousin. Juemin anticipates the time when his academy begins admitting female students so that the two can get together and marry.

Juehui has a romantic interest in Ming Feng. Han says that Juehui \"pays more attention to the rebellion\" than to Ming Feng. After Ming Feng's death he feels remorse. At the end of the novel, he believes staying in the family is too suffocating, so he leaves Chengdu to go to Shanghai.\nAccording to Feng, Juehui is \"the center of consciousness\" in Family. Feng said that while Juehui \"is apparently the most fearless and rebellious of the three brothers\" he also \"is by no means the heroic role model that he has read about in new books and journals\u2014the sources of all his new ideas.\" Feng argues that \"Juehui betrays the most pronounced contradictions through his interactions with his family\" and that Juehui \"often finds himself helplessly entangled in ambivalent feelings\" while dealing with his family, using his interactions with Juexin as an example. Han argued that while being \"high-spirited youth rebelling against his family's restrictions\", Juehui \"still possesses ideas\" from the Gao Family traditions. As an example she cites his pattern of affection for Ming Feng. Han argues that despite the fact that he likes her, \"he never expresses his love or his hidden dreams: If only Ming Feng were a lady like Qin, he would marry her in a heartbeat.\"\nLi Ruijue (\u674e\u745e\u73a8; \u674e\u745e\u73cf; L\u01d0 Ru\u00ecju\u00e9; Li3 Jui4-ch\u00fceh2) - Juexin's wife.

She dies in childbirth.\nHan said that Ruijue \"is beautiful and mild, and their intensive love produces their first boy, Hai Chen.\" After Master Gao dies, as Ruijue is pregnant with a second child, relatives cajole Juexin into moving Ruijue out of the city to avoid giving the coffin of Master Gao. Despite Juehui's pleas to have it reversed, Juexin allows the move to happen, and Ruijue dies of childbirth as Juexin is prevented from entering the delivery room during the period of mourning for Master Gao.\nMei (Chinese: \u6885; pinyin: M\u00e9i; Wade\u2013Giles: Mei2) - Juexin's cousin and the love of his life. She falls ill and dies.\nHan said that Mei \"lives a miserable life.\" Within a year from the start of the novel she marries and becomes a widow. Because her mother-in-law had not treated her well, she lives with her mother. Han said that the Gao family's younger members, especially Juexin, \"are sympathetic\" to Mei.\nMing Feng (\u9cf4\u9cf3; \u9e23\u51e4; M\u00edngf\u00e8ng; Ming2-feng4) - A maidservant who is forced to marry an older man. She commits suicide.\nHan describes Ming Feng as \"another tragic woman\" in the Gao family. Ming Feng wants to marry Juehui but Master Gao arranges to have her be a mistress to Milord Feng, a man who is at the same age level as Ming Feng's grandfather would be. Ming Feng begs other members to remove her from the situation but nobody can challenge Master Gao. At midnight before she is to be given to Feng, she appears in Juehui's bedroom but he is so busy working on academic articles that he does not notice Ming Feng and her pleas. She commits suicide by drowning herself in a pool of water. Han says \"Jue Min [sic] and others pity the girl, while Jue Hui [sic] now regrets his carelessness. However none of the people could have changed Ming Feng's fate.\"\nQin (\u7434; Q\u00edn; Ch'in2): A female cousin of Gao Juexin, and a student.\nFeng said that Qin \"is ensconced, somewhat ironically, in extensive and complex familial relationships\" so that the book rarely mentions her life away from the Gao family. Feng explained that because Ba Jin made the female student Qin as a more \"feminine\" and \"inferior\" counterpart to the male student Juehui, the \"domestication\" of Qin is \"necessary\". Feng argued that \"at first glance\" Qin and Juehui \"seem to me more similar than different\", and their parallel and symmetrical placement within the storyline of Family \"serves both to segregate the domains of their activities by gender and to differentiate the degree of their radicalism.\" For instance Feng notes that Qin does not come into conflict with male characters in her immediate or extended family and \"acts as a dutiful and loving daughter to her widowed mother\" while Juehui \"usually displays an antagonistic attitude\" towards older men in the Gao family and Juehui leaves the Gao family home. Feng concluded that the fact that Juehui leaves his house means that \"his conflicts with the traditional family system are more fundamental and irreconcilable than those in Qin's case.\" Feng argued that the author \"deployed Qin to magnify Juehui's revolutionary zeal\" by emphasizing differences that the two characters have in their emotional responses and respective relationships to the members of the Gao family and also \"located the source of Qin's weakness in her gender and thus reaffirmed Juehui's superiority.\"\nMaster Gao - The head of the Gao family.As Master Gao grows older, he attempts to reunite the Gao family.\nHan argues that Master Gao is \"complex\". She explained that Master Gao in fact loves his family and takes steps to enlarge it to accomplish his goal of having a large family, and that he does not believe that his decisions, which are based on ancestral rules, would harm his children. Han concluded that \"Withdrawing his order on his deathbed shows that he remained a kind grandfather at the end, even if he was an ironhanded patriarch.\"\nMadam Zhou", "hasanswer": false}]}

Vikram's mother, Rajeshwari, was a government officer who reached the rank of sub-collector. Rajeshwari was born in a Hindu family with film connections.

This inspired Vikram to take theatre lessons and become professionally trained in classical and cinema dance forms to ensure that he became a leading actor. Vikram decided to use a screen name because he disliked his original name, Kennedy, and he also felt that such a foreign name was not a fit name for an actor in Tamil films. He took the name Vikram (a Hindu name) which means \"man who does great deeds.\" In one interview, he said that he was also inspired to take the name because it was a mixture of several names dear to him: \"Vi\" from his father's name (Vinod), \"K\" from Kennedy, \"Ra\" from his mother's name (Rajeshwari) and \"ram\" from his sun sign, Aries.Vikram was educated at Montfort School, Yercaud (a boarding school in a hill station near Salem) and graduated in 1983. He has mentioned that he used his opportunities at school well by taking part in karate, horseback riding and swimming and noted that such early exposure to activities gave him confidence as a youngster. Vikram lurked in the fringes of the school's theatre club for a long period and often took part in backstage work before being handed the lead role in a school adaptation of Moli\u00e8re's The Doctor in Spite of Himself after the original lead had contracted chicken pox. Despite expressing his interest to join films after school, his father forced him to go through education and Vikram subsequently graduated from Loyola College, Chennai with a degree in English Literature and worked halfway towards an MBA programme. Through the prolific dramatics club, Vikram appeared in stage productions including college adaptations of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial and Peter Shaffer's Black Comedy, receiving best actor awards for his performances. After winning a Best Actor Award at a function held at IIT Madras, Vikram was hit by a truck during a ride on his motorbike on the way home and suffered a serious leg injury. He remained hospital-ridden for three years during college and subsequently went through twenty-three surgeries to prevent his leg from being amputated. Vikram then returned to finish the final year of his degree after his accident and secured permission to finish his dissertation at home, as he was only able to walk on crutches for a short period.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Wyneken do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_37752", "text": "In early 1838, Wyneken sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and arrived in Baltimore, Maryland. He noted that the following year, 5000 fellow Germans arrived weekly in the relatively nearby port of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alone, most fleeing economic hardship, warfare, and political repression in the various German states\u2014and that emigration would continue until the American Civil War. Wyneken worked in Baltimore helping the ailing Rev. Johann Heaesbaert and a mixed congregation of Lutherans and Reformed (Moravians) for about a year.\nThen, as his mentor recovered, the Pennsylvania Ministerium of Lutherans sent Wyneken westward to serve the many Protestant German farmers who had moved into Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he met C. F. Schmidt, editor of Lutherische Kirchenzeitung, who would become a friend and supporter, but continued his evangelism westward. In Putnam and Allen counties in Ohio, Wyneken found Lutherans who had not heard a sermon in years, so he baptized many children, and decided to tell his fellow ministers still in Germany about the massive need for their ministry in the New World. However, first he ministered to Germans in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the nearby settlement of Friedheim, Preble Township, in northwest Adams County, whose pastor, Jesse Hoover, had died in May 1838. Then he made Fort Wayne, a portage and canal town, his base, and traveled among the isolated settlements on the Michigan Road to the north as well as in central Indiana and western Ohio.\nHe joined the Evangelical Synod of the West (despite misgivings about its ecumenical stance), and also appealed to the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States of North America for more clergy, especially for the frustrating missionary survey work, when the isolated German protestants wanted to establish their own church communities. While the General Synod did not have resources, various missionary societies in Germany did. Already in 1840, the Bremen (missionary) Society for Protestant Germans had sent two missionary pastors to America, and they sent another five in 1842.\nOn August 31, 1841, he married Sophia Marie Wilhelmine Buuch (1824\u20131891), daughter of the first settler in Friedheim. That same year, the Stade missionary society sent G. Jensen to cover Wyneken's pastoral responsibilities at St. Paul's in Fort Wayne while he and his wife returned to Germany for medical treatment of a throat ailment. There, Wyneken published Die Noth der deutschen Lutheraner in Nordamerika (English translation: The Distress of the German Lutherans in North America). This, together with his personal contacts and correspondence with Wilhelm Loehe as well as mission societies in Hanover, Bremen, Erlangen, Breslau, Leipzig, and Berlin over the next year while he received medical treatment (and began raising his first child), inspired many German ministers and theology students (22 trained by Loehe himself) to emigrate to America.While Wyneken returned to the United States in May 1843 with Adolf Biewend (who soon accepted a call from a congregation near Washington, D.C.), Loehe and Rev. Johann Friedrich Wucherer worked in Germany to send missionaries to North America, publishing Kirchliche Mitteilungen aus und ueber Nord-Amerika. Wyneken, in 1845, became the delegate of the Synod of the West to the General Synod. He then accepted a call of a Baltimore congregation, where he served for five years, then moved to St. Louis for four years.\nWyneken worked with C. F. W. Walther, who had founded Concordia Seminary in St. Louis and had become the first president of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod. Wyneken succeeded Walther and served as the Missouri Synod's second president for fourteen years.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to one version, after Adrastus' brother Pronax, who was king of Argos, died, Adrastus fled to Sicyon, where his mother's father Polybus was king, and eventually inherited the Sicyonian throne. While according to another, Adrastus fled to Sicyon after Amphiaraus killed Talaus, and got the throne by marrying Polybus' daughter.In any case, Adrastus became king of Sicyon. Then, according to Pindar, Adrastus (and his brothers) were able to effect a reconciliation with Amphiaraus by giving him their sister Eriphyle in marriage, and Adrastus was able to return to Argos and assume the Argive throne.Adrastus was the owner of the fabulously fast horse Arion, who was the offspring of Posidon and Demeter when they mated in horse form.

He is one of the major philosophers working on the implications of cyberspace and digital communications. L\u00e9vy has written a dozen of books that have been translated in more than 12 languages and are studied in many universities all over the world. His principal work, published in French in 1994 and translated into English, is entitled Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace.As early as 1990 L\u00e9vy published a book about the merging of digital networks and hypertextual communication. L\u00e9vy's theory of knowledge spaces and the cosmopedia foreshadowed the emergence of Wikipedia and anticipates wikinomics, and the efficacy of shared distributed knowledge systems.From 1993 to 1998 L\u00e9vy was Professor at the University of Paris VIII, where he studied the concept of collective intelligence and knowledge-based societies. He has contributed to many scholarly discourses about cyberculture.He was a member of the editorial board of the Revue virtuelle project of the Pompidou Centre in Paris from 1995 to 1997 and was the author of a report on cyberculture for the Council of Europe in 1996.In the chapter Interactivity from his book Cyberculture (2001), L\u00e9vy argues that analogue communication (telephone, mail) differs from digital communication (email, chat) in terms of temporal organization and material involvement of their communication systems. He claims that interactivity is a vague term that \"has more to do with finding the solution to a problem, the need to develop new ways to observe, design, and evaluate methods of communication, than it does with identifying a simple, unique characteristic that can be assigned to a given system\". Henry Jenkins, among others, cites him as an important influence on theories of online collective intelligence.In Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age L\u00e9vy explores the way we virtualise every aspect of our lives, from real time (media) interaction through language, to our actions through technology, and our social relations through institutions.

Digby Diehl of the Times referred to the band's sound as \"a hypnotic m\u00e9lange\" and further wrote that: \"The flute and harpsichord jazz improvisations on numbers such as 'Stephanie Knows Who' and 'Orange Skies' lend a fresh lift to what might be an ordinary rock piece.\" A later review from the paper placed the band's \"clean\" presentation and \"balance of instruments and roles\" with those of the Beatles and Buffalo Springfield. Echols remembered the band's performances with the expanded lineup as \"probably the most fun we had playing.\"Da Capo was first announced as an album on November 12, 1966, with an advertisement placed by Elektra on page 1 of Billboard magazine. By late January 1967 when Da Capo was listed by Billboard as a \"New Action Album\", \"7 and 7 Is\" had already received commercial and critical success, helping to boost the album's sales. It entered the Billboard Top LPs chart on February 11, 1967, and peaked at number 80 on April 8, failing to achieve the commercial success the band had hoped it would. Lee blamed the album's disappointing performance on Elektra, but Botnick disagreed, saying, \"Arthur wouldn't go out and promote it!\" Stuart later reflected that the band \"should have toured behind it\"; however, he recognized that Lee \"prided himself on being different. If bands toured after releasing an album, he would do it differently.\" Regarding the album as \"an undeniably groundbreaking release for 1966\" with a style that had \"no other context or reference in [rock] up to that point\", Einarson asks if Lee had \"overestimated his own audience with a body of music perhaps too complex and esoteric for their tastes\". In the observation of writer Jim Bickhart, \"by that point, Arthur had shown he was kind of oblivious to who his audience was and how to appeal to them ... he was not thinking, 'I'm going to bring my audience along with me,' he was just thinking, 'I'm going to do what I'm going to do.'\"Da Capo received favorable recognition from contemporary reviewers. David Harris of Mojo-Navigator called it \"a great advance\" over Love's debut album and recognized their \"integration of jazz and [rock] into a new form of music.\" In a more critical review for Esquire magazine, Robert Christgau felt that, although \"7 and 7 Is\" was a \"perfect rocker\", the rest of side one \"sounds cluttered and lacks sock\", directing the latter criticism to Lee's voice being \"more often too sweet for his material.\" Of \"Revelation\", Christgau wrote: \"It includes excellent guitar and harmonica work and great screaming ...

He created Murong Chui the Marquess of Bintu and greatly honored him, despite misgivings by his prime minister Wang Meng.  He also made Murong Chui one of his generals.\nLater in 369, after Murong Ping refused to cede the Luoyang region to Former Qin, as Former Yan had promised when seeking Former Qin's aid against Jin, Fu Ji\u0101n sent Wang to attack Former Yan.  Wang requested that Murong Chui's heir apparent Murong Ling accompany him as a guide.  After capturing Luoyang in early 370, Wang bribed Murong Chui's attendant Jin Xi (\u91d1\u7199) to give Murong Ling a false message that Murong Chui had heard that Empress Dowager Kezuhun had regretted her actions and that, therefore, he was defecting back to Former Yan. Murong Ling, unable to verify either the truth or the falsehood of the message, decided to defect back to Former Yan. Wang immediately accused Murong Ling of treason, and Murong Chui, in fear, fled, but was captured, although Fu Ji\u0101n believed that Murong Ling was acting independently and therefore pardoned Murong Chui.  Former Yan did not trust Murong Ling and exiled him, and later that year, after he tried to start a rebellion, he was killed in battle after being betrayed by his brother Murong Lin.\nLate in 370, after Wang defeated Murong Ping and conquered Former Yan, Murong Chui accompanied Fu Ji\u0101n to visit the Former Yan capital Yecheng.  Initially, he did not hide his disgust to those officials who failed to support him during the struggle with Murong Ping and Empress Dowager Kezuhun, but at Gao Bi's suggestion, he started to treat them with kindness, with the rebuilding of Yan in mind.  Still, in 372, he accused Murong Ping of being the root of Former Yan's destruction and requested that Fu Ji\u0101n avenge Former Yan by executing Murong Ping; Fu Ji\u0101n did not do so, but effectively exiled Murong Ping by making him the governor of a distant commandery.\nIn 378, Murong Chui participated in the campaign commanded by Fu Ji\u0101n's son Fu Pi against Jin's key city of Xiangyang.  In 382, when Fu Ji\u0101n wanted to launch a major campaign to destroy Jin and unite China, most officials, including Fu Ji\u0101n's brother Fu Rong, who succeeded Wang as prime minister after Wang's death in 375, opposed, but Murong Chui and Yao Chang urged the campaign, and Fu Ji\u0101n launched his campaign in fall 383.  However, Former Qin forces, commanded by Fu Rong, was defeated by Jin forces at the Battle of Fei River despite great numerical superiority; Fu Rong was killed, and almost the entire army collapsed\u2014although the forces under Murong Chui's command remained intact, and Fu Ji\u0101n, who suffered an arrow wound during the defeat, fled to Murong Chui.  Murong Chui's son Murong Bao and brother Murong De both tried to persuade Murong Chui to kill Fu Ji\u0101n while he had the power to, but Murong Chui instead returned his forces to Fu Ji\u0101n's command and returned to Luoyang with Fu Ji\u0101n.  However, under suggestion by his son Murong Nong, he planned a rebellion to rebuild Yan.\nMurong Chui told Fu Ji\u0101n that he was fearful that the people over the Former Yan territory would rebel, and that it would be best if he led a force to pacify the region.  Fu Ji\u0101n agreed, despite opposition by Quan Yi (\u6b0a\u7ffc).  Murong Chui took the army and arrived at Yecheng, which was being defended by Fu Pi.  They suspected each other, but each ruled out ambushing the other.  When the Dingling chief Zhai Bin (\u7fdf\u658c) rebelled and attacked Luoyang, guarded by Fu Pi's younger brother Fu Hui (\u82fb\u6689), Fu Pi ordered Murong Chui to put down Zhai's rebellion, and Fu Pi sent his assistant Fu Feilong (\u82fb\u98db\u9f8d) to serve as Murong Chui's assistant. On the way to Luoyang, however, Murong Chui killed Fu Feilong and his Di soldiers and prepared to openly rebel. Meanwhile, despite his suspicions of Murong Chui, Fu Pi did not put Murong Chui's son Murong Nong and nephews Murong Kai and Murong Shao (\u6155\u5bb9\u7d39) under surveillance, and the three fled out of Yecheng and started a rebellion of their own.\nIn spring 384, Murong Chui, not yet in open rebellion against Former Qin, arrived at Luoyang, but Fu Hui, hearing of Fu Feilong's death, refused to welcome him.  Murong Chui then entered into an alliance with Zhai Bin, who urged him to take imperial title.

After being diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, Vicki faced the hard choice of leaving Homicide Division in the police department and working a desk job or leaving the police force altogether. Despite strong protests from her partner and lover, Detective Mike Celluci, she decided to leave the force and open a private investigation firm.\nThough her vision does prove to be a problem at times, Vicki refuses to let anyone treat her like she is disabled and continues to take risks with her life throughout the course of her investigations. As a result of leaving the force, her relationship with Celluci has become on-again/off-again. Meanwhile, her growing attraction to Henry only fuels the complications in her love life, putting her in the center of a supernatural love triangle.\nHenry Fitzroy\n(b. June 15, 1519 d. June 18, 1536 reborn June 19, 1536) Based on the historical character Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset - the illegitimate son of Henry VIII of England, Henry Fitzroy chose love over familial duty and sacrificed his mortal life to remain forever with the woman he loved; Christina.  Vampiric circumstances, however, prevented him from remaining with her and now, after 470 years of existence, he is living in Toronto as a graphic novelist (a.k.a. comic book artist)- \"Art and literature have always been my passions.  I finally found a medium where I could fully realize the both of them.\"  His quiet, hidden life takes on a new twist when he collides with Vicki Nelson in an attempt to stop a man from bringing the demon Asteroth into the mortal world. As they work to solve this case, and subsequently other supernatural problems, Henry grows deeply attracted to Vicki's willful nature and exuberance for life, eventually falling for her. Though she seems to resist his advances, he continues to pursue her and, mostly due to his centuries of experience and knowledge of both sides of the supernatural, he becomes Vicki's partner and bodyguard.\nDetective Mike Celluci\nVicki's former partner, as well as on/off lover, he was very much against her decision to leave the force. He and Vicki share many personality traits, which often results in arguments between the two. Yet despite (or perhaps because of) this they are firm friends, both going so far as to discuss their current cases. As straight as they come, and a \"see it to believe it\" kind of guy to boot, Mike often exhibits concern over the kind of cases Vicki seems willing to take on in her new career. He has trouble accepting Vicki's friendship and trust in Henry, even more so once he finds out what Henry is, often coming across as jealous. However, they have been known to work together on occasion - especially when it is Vicki who needs help.\nCoreen Fennel\nCoreen becomes known to Vicki during her first \"unusual\" case, hiring her to find out who killed her boyfriend. Once the case was over, she managed to insinuate herself into the position of Vicki's office assistant. Coreen appears to have extensive knowledge about the occult, and is certainly far more curious and accepting of it than any of the other characters. Because of this, she seems to have struck up a friendship with Dr. Sagara, a professor of the occult known to Henry, and the two can occasionally be seen working together on a case for Vicki. Coreen can at times serve as an emissary between Vicki and Mike, usually trying to get Vicki talking with him again. It was shown various times that she may have a crush on Henry, most prominently when first meeting him. However, when the two rarely work together, Coreen's lingering looks may suggest that she has a crush on him or it may be the way Henry naturally attracts women. This character does not appear in the books beyond the \"client\" role she originated in the first episode, and it has been suggested that she \"replaced\" the character of Tony. Several sources cite the omission of Tony as being due to copyright reasons in that the rights to the series of books that feature Tony are owned by another network. Fan sites claim that there were aspects of Tony's free-spirited, reformed street hustler character that might have proved offensive or unsettling to the general viewing public.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Parry Thomas's River Grove Farm in Sun Valley, Idaho.\nMcDonald's first mount was an $800 pony. She agreed that she would pay for board if her parents bought it for her. Shortly thereafter Debbie managed to find a gaited horse trainer near her hometown who allowed her to groom horses and clean stalls in exchange for board.  At age 14,  when Debbie went to turn her pony out, she discovered a strange man in his stall, beating him. She went running for help and ran into a young trainer and her future husband, Bob McDonald, who ran a hunter/jumper farm and hired her as a stable hand.  It was at this facility that she began her career.McDonald began her career in show jumping. However, she switched to dressage after a serious fall in which her horse somersaulted over her breaking ribs, rupturing her spleen, and fracturing a vertebra in her neck,   She first met Parry and Peggy Thomas when she got a catch ride at a dressage show in Las Vegas on one of their horses whose rider was not available.The Thomases also became the owners of Brentina, a chestnut Hanoverian mare that became McDonald's primary mount. McDonald and her husband obtained the mare at an auction in Germany in 1994.  Brentina, foaled in 1991, had a suitable temperament to respect McDonald, who is only five feet tall, and the team established a partnership that took them to the Olympics. McDonald and Brentina began by winning the Individual and Team Gold medals at the 1999 Pan American Games.  In recognition of this accomplishment, McDonald was named the 1999 Equestrian of the Year by the United States Equestrian Federation and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) Female Equestrian Athlete of the Year.

The recording sessions also became known as a stepping stone in Davis' move from bebop to modal jazz. The live side in particular was seen by critics as a glimpse at the sextet that would record Kind of Blue. The complementary and seemingly spontaneous style of performance ethic and the relationship between Davis and his musicians was fundamental for his work during these sessions and improved onto the Kind of Blue sessions.\nJazz historian and journalist Ira Gitler has considered 1958 Miles to be one of Davis' best works, while also noting that he was \"very taken with the performances\", alluding to the album's recordings after Gitler had listened to them. In the 1979 LP reissue liner notes, Gitler wrote \"These prime cuts of the Miles Davis Sextet, representative of what this most influential leader and his trendsetting band of that time, were doing in that particular portion of 1958, are a most welcome addition to the collectors library.\" The live portion of the album recorded at The Plaza Hotel was noted by critics as an early stage of the new sextet. Music writer Nicholas Taylor later wrote of the Plaza set:\n\nAn interesting and puzzling period piece, documenting the sextet exploring a sound that would soon morph into the rich tapestry of their 1959 masterpiece ... It is the snapshot\u2014albeit a blurred one\u2014of a group of musicians on the verge of greatness, beginning to feel each other\u2019s tics and idiosyncrasies, forming the bonds of a sextet that would soon alter the history of jazz forever.\nPrior to the live session, Miles Davis had already established a reputation as one of the jazz era's top live performers, following well-received performances at such venues as Birdland, also known as \"The Jazz Corner of the World\", in New York and the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island during the mid-1950s. The set at the Plaza Hotel further expanded Davis' repertoire in concert venues and increased his popularity among jazz fans and writers. Even though Milestones was Davis' first use of modes and Cannonball Adderley's presence helped make the band became a more powerful sextet, these sessions helped introduce Bill Evans to the music of Miles Davis. The May 26 session, in particular, exposed Evans to Davis' spontaneous ability in the studio to simplify complicated musical structures. In a 1979 interview for the jazz radio station WKCR, Evans remarked on his recording experience with Davis, stating \"Miles occasionally might say, 'Right here, I want this sound', and it turn out be a very key thing that changes the whole character of the [song]. For instance, on 'On Green Dolphin Street', the original changes of the chorus aren't the way [we recorded it]: the vamp changes being a major seventh up a minor third, down a half tone. That was [one when] he leaned over and said, 'I want this here.'\" Evans' influence would be apparent on the Kind of Blue sessions as it was during the initial 1958 sessions. All recorded studio work by Davis from 1958 for Columbia was later reissued on the box set compilation The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane. Following the implementation of his first modal compositions with the title track of Milestones and his first sessions with Bill Evans, the 1958 Sessions, Davis became satisfied with the results. This led to his preparation of an entire album based on modality, his 1959 masterwork, Kind of Blue.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the early years of her marriage, Sophie faced public scrutiny for her business interests, and was often compared to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, who had died two years earlier. On her transition to becoming a full-time royal, she later stated: \"Certainly it took me a while to find my feet. The frustration was I had to reduce my expectations of what I could actually do. I couldn't turn up at a charity and go, right, I think you should be doing this, because that's what I was used to doing in my working life. I had to take a really big step back and go, OK, they want you to be the icing on the cake, the person to come in to thank their volunteers and funders, not necessarily to tell them how to run their communications plan.\"Sophie has since been cited as an under-the-radar \"stabilizing influence\" and a \"safe pair of hands\". She has been said to have a low-key approach to royal engagements, and often drives herself to and from events. Amanda Pullinger stated to Town and Country, \"She actually presents herself as an ordinary person and I think that is increasingly what the royal family needs to do.\" She has also been noted for her long-term work on \"gritty\" subject matters such as gender-based violence in conflict, and trips to \"difficult areas\", such as South Sudan and Sierra Leone. The Countess's engagements gained significant attention from the public post-Megxit, with her charity work and style choices receiving increased commentary and analysis. Writer Ingrid Seward states that Sophie \"is not a self-publicist....She looks good, without being over-the-top, and she's not craving celebrity. You often wouldn't know she had carried out all those engagements.\"Sophie was not initially prominent for her fashion, but eventually began to develop her own style and has worn outfits by many notable designers. She has exclusively worn Jane Taylor millinery designs since 2009 on numerous occasions. In a Marie Claire interview, Taylor described her first royal commission: \"My first royal client was the Countess of Wessex, and it was quite nerve-racking. But she wears such lovely clothes and she always looks so fabulous, so it's quite easy to design for her. Since she came to see me, she's never worn any other milliner's hats, which is a big compliment. I was really excited, honored, and slightly nervous.\" Alongside the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Sussex, Sophie has been named one of the most stylish members of the royal family. Sophie is particularly known for wearing different combinations of hats and coats, and favours silk dresses and frocks. Describing her style in an interview by Sunday Express Sophie said: \"It's about my charities, but I recognize that I'm on display. [...] When you walk into a room, yes, people are going to talk about what you're doing there, but they're also going to want to know what you're wearing\". She also revealed that she has never had a stylist of her own and that she makes her fashion choices herself. In 2015, the Countess was named on Vanity Fair's Best Dressed List. Together with the then-Duchess of Cambridge, Sophie hosted the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace during the 2018 London Fashion Week.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He created the Collegium Musicum there, developing his interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, later expanding his activities to include the Classical and early Romantic eras. He is now in demand as a fortepianist in concert halls across Europe, where he is known for his refined sensitivity to the rhetorical aspects of music and for his skills in improvisation. (His cadenzas were singled out in reviews of his Beethoven concerto recordings.) Over the years, he has acquired a unique collection of period keyboard instruments, which travel with him for concerts and CD recordings.\nIn 1977, he attracted international attention when he conducted Monteverdi's L'Orfeo in the former Royal Flemish Opera House in Antwerp. This series of 18 performances established a new standard which remains to this day.\nFrom 1980 to 1985, he was the artistic director of the Sweelinck Conservatory of Amsterdam.\nIn 1987 Van Immerseel established the \"period instrument\" ensemble Anima Eterna, which he continues to lead.

He can play at exceptionally fast speeds, and does a signature 3-finger walk (a \"galloping\" finger motion). He revealed in a making-of DVD for Cannibal Corpse's album The Wretched Spawn that he initially started playing guitar but changed to bass because he felt he could master the instrument more quickly. Unlike usual heavy metal bassists that play at high speeds, Webster is able to play his instrument without the use of a pick, while still retaining a clean clear tone, which helps maintain clarity in the complex and very fast lines he plays in conjunction with the heavily distorted guitars of Cannibal Corpse.\n\n\"When I was six years old I took some acoustic guitar lessons. It didn't really work out because I was six and didn't really want to learn \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" and those were the kind of songs I was being taught. I wanted to play Elvis. I liked all the old 50s music. My dad had a bunch of old 50s records because that's when he was a teenager. Those were what I listened to, because when you're six you don't have the money to go buy stuff, so I just listened to his records. Nobody was going to teach me how to play the guitar like that, out in the country where I lived. I just gave it up until I was 13 or 14. I met a kid in school who played bass in the high school jazz band. He wanted to make some extra money and it was five bucks a lesson. He did a good job too. His name was Mike Hudson. I don't know if he plays anymore. I lost touch with him. He's the one that got me started. I always wanted to play in a band, and to learn how to play lead guitar was going to take like five years. But I really liked the sound of the bass. I liked AC/DC and figured I could do that. I thought I could learn Cliff Williams' bass parts faster than I could learn to play Angus Young's guitar parts. It was motivation, because I wanted to be in a band. I never wanted to sit around and play music by myself. I wanted to play with other people, and the fastest route to that was playing an instrument that wasn't a lead instrument, and bass was that. Now I've learned to make it a lot more difficult. I've made my job a lot harder than it probably needs to be. But it's just fun. In the beginning my concern was playing in a band.\"\"I took some lessons from a friend of mine when I first started. He was in the school jazz band and he taught me the basics. I didn't take lessons for about a year, but I started again when I was a senior in high school. I've had about four different teachers throughout the years, but I never took lessons for more than a few months. I did, however, gain a lot from them and I've tried to learn as much on my own as I can. Anything I can learn about music or bass playing, I'll try to learn. I mean, the more you learn and the more you apply to your playing, it just makes you a better musician.\"\"I liked the bass player from AC/DC. I really loved the stuff he did. Peter Baltes from Accept was another. I liked the really good guys too, but that seemed out of reach at the beginning. Geddy Lee from Rush and Steve Harris were like gods to me. Billy Sheehan was from Buffalo, and we all knew about Billy before the rest of the country did. Billy has been a legend in Buffalo for a long, long time. He's still one of my favorites. By the time I was listening to Cliff Burton I was getting a little better. I had been playing a year or so before I started listening to Metallica. I thought he was great. I always thought he could have been a little louder on those albums though. That's the thing. In thrash metal or any other kind of metal where the bass is playing exactly what the guitar is playing, automatically the bass went down in the mix. If you notice those older bands like Accept, the bass is doing something that's a little bit different from the guitar. It's more with the kick drum instead of playing the riff the guitar is doing. In thrash metal and then death metal, the bass player always wound up playing what the guitar player was doing most of the time. It's been a decade long fight for us to be heard in the mix.\"\"I'd like to do some instructional material, but I'm still not sure if I'll try and do a DVD or book though. It will probably be easier to do a DVD, actually. Hopefully I'll be able to come up with some stuff that's worth releasing. I definitely won't put anything out until I'm sure it's of really high quality, and full of lots of good information. Also, you might have heard about the possibility of us doing a tab book. Well, we still haven't found a publisher for that.\"\"I practice the most when I have something I'm working on that's difficult, like one of Pat's songs for example. I usually won't practice for more than 3 or 4 hours a day unless I'm really inspired, or I have some kind of deadline.\"\n\nBesides playing bass, Alex has also contributed to lyric and music writing on many occasions for the band, some examples being \"Fucked with a Knife,\" \"Puncture Wound Massacre,\" \"I Will Kill You,\" \"Devoured by Vermin,\" \"Unleashing the Bloodthirsty,\" \"Scavenger consuming death,\" \"Scourge of iron\" and \"Murder Worship\".\nWebster is also known for his bass guitar solos/fills in such songs as \"Addicted to Vaginal Skin\", \"Mangled\", \"The Undead Will Feast\", \"Crushing the Despised\", \"Fucked with a Knife\", \"Hammer Smashed Face\", \"The Discipline of Revenge\", \"Put Them To Death\", \"She Was Asking For It\", \"Staring Through The Eyes of the Dead\", \"Bloodlands\", \"They Deserve to Die\", \"Rabid\", and \"The Strangulation Chair\".\nFrom 2013 to 2015 Webster wrote a monthly tuition column for the UK's Bass Guitar Magazine.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1972, Time commented that \"a streak of suspicion seems to underlie all that he does\" and \"His jokes about his paranoia have an uncomfortable edge of truth\". He was so often seen escorting Hollywood starlets that the Village Voice charged he was \"a secret square posing as a swinger\". The insight, \"Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac\", is widely attributed to him, although Kissinger was paraphrasing Napoleon Bonaparte. Critics on the right, such as Ray Takeyh, have faulted Kissinger for his role in the Nixon administration's opening to China and secret negotiations with North Vietnam. Takeyh writes that while rapprochement with China was a worthy goal, the Nixon administration failed to achieve any meaningful concessions from Chinese officials in return, as China continued to support North Vietnam and various \"revolutionary forces throughout the Third World\", \"nor does there appear to be even a remote, indirect connection between Nixon and Kissinger's diplomacy and the communist leadership's decision, after Mao's bloody rule, to move away from a communist economy towards state capitalism.\"Historian Jeffrey Kimball developed the theory that Kissinger and the Nixon administration accepted a South Vietnamese collapse provided a face-saving decent interval passed between U.S. withdrawal and defeat. In his first meeting with Zhou Enlai in 1971, Kissinger \"laid out in detail the settlement terms that would produce such a delayed defeat: total American withdrawal, return of all American POWs, and a ceasefire-in-place for '18 months or some period'\", in the words of historian Ken Hughes. On October 6, 1972, Kissinger told Nixon twice that the terms of the Paris Peace Accords would probably destroy South Vietnam: \"I also think that Thieu is right, that our terms will eventually destroy him.\" However, Kissinger denied using a \"decent interval\" strategy, writing \"All of us who negotiated the agreement of October 12 were convinced that we had vindicated the anguish of a decade not by a 'decent interval' but by a decent settlement.\" Johannes Kadura offers a positive assessment of Nixon and Kissinger's strategy, arguing that the two men \"simultaneously maintained a Plan A of further supporting Saigon and a Plan B of shielding Washington should their maneuvers prove futile.\" According to Kadura, the \"decent interval\" concept has been \"largely misrepresented\", in that Nixon and Kissinger \"sought to gain time, make the North turn inward, and create a perpetual equilibrium\" rather than acquiescing in the collapse of South Vietnam.Kissinger's record was brought up during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Hillary Clinton had cultivated a close relationship with Kissinger, describing him as a \"friend\" and a source of \"counsel\". During the Democratic primary debates, Clinton touted Kissinger's praise for her record as secretary of state. In response, candidate Bernie Sanders criticized Kissinger and said: \"I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.\"Kissinger was an immensely beloved figure within China, with China News Service describing him in his obituary as someone \"who had a sharp vision and a thorough understanding of world affairs\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

He can play at exceptionally fast speeds, and does a signature 3-finger walk (a \"galloping\" finger motion). He revealed in a making-of DVD for Cannibal Corpse's album The Wretched Spawn that he initially started playing guitar but changed to bass because he felt he could master the instrument more quickly. Unlike usual heavy metal bassists that play at high speeds, Webster is able to play his instrument without the use of a pick, while still retaining a clean clear tone, which helps maintain clarity in the complex and very fast lines he plays in conjunction with the heavily distorted guitars of Cannibal Corpse.\n\n\"When I was six years old I took some acoustic guitar lessons. It didn't really work out because I was six and didn't really want to learn \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" and those were the kind of songs I was being taught. I wanted to play Elvis. I liked all the old 50s music. My dad had a bunch of old 50s records because that's when he was a teenager. Those were what I listened to, because when you're six you don't have the money to go buy stuff, so I just listened to his records. Nobody was going to teach me how to play the guitar like that, out in the country where I lived. I just gave it up until I was 13 or 14. I met a kid in school who played bass in the high school jazz band. He wanted to make some extra money and it was five bucks a lesson. He did a good job too. His name was Mike Hudson. I don't know if he plays anymore. I lost touch with him. He's the one that got me started. I always wanted to play in a band, and to learn how to play lead guitar was going to take like five years. But I really liked the sound of the bass. I liked AC/DC and figured I could do that. I thought I could learn Cliff Williams' bass parts faster than I could learn to play Angus Young's guitar parts. It was motivation, because I wanted to be in a band. I never wanted to sit around and play music by myself. I wanted to play with other people, and the fastest route to that was playing an instrument that wasn't a lead instrument, and bass was that. Now I've learned to make it a lot more difficult. I've made my job a lot harder than it probably needs to be. But it's just fun. In the beginning my concern was playing in a band.\"\"I took some lessons from a friend of mine when I first started. He was in the school jazz band and he taught me the basics. I didn't take lessons for about a year, but I started again when I was a senior in high school. I've had about four different teachers throughout the years, but I never took lessons for more than a few months. I did, however, gain a lot from them and I've tried to learn as much on my own as I can. Anything I can learn about music or bass playing, I'll try to learn. I mean, the more you learn and the more you apply to your playing, it just makes you a better musician.\"\"I liked the bass player from AC/DC. I really loved the stuff he did. Peter Baltes from Accept was another. I liked the really good guys too, but that seemed out of reach at the beginning. Geddy Lee from Rush and Steve Harris were like gods to me. Billy Sheehan was from Buffalo, and we all knew about Billy before the rest of the country did. Billy has been a legend in Buffalo for a long, long time. He's still one of my favorites. By the time I was listening to Cliff Burton I was getting a little better. I had been playing a year or so before I started listening to Metallica. I thought he was great. I always thought he could have been a little louder on those albums though. That's the thing. In thrash metal or any other kind of metal where the bass is playing exactly what the guitar is playing, automatically the bass went down in the mix. If you notice those older bands like Accept, the bass is doing something that's a little bit different from the guitar. It's more with the kick drum instead of playing the riff the guitar is doing. In thrash metal and then death metal, the bass player always wound up playing what the guitar player was doing most of the time. It's been a decade long fight for us to be heard in the mix.\"\"I'd like to do some instructional material, but I'm still not sure if I'll try and do a DVD or book though. It will probably be easier to do a DVD, actually. Hopefully I'll be able to come up with some stuff that's worth releasing. I definitely won't put anything out until I'm sure it's of really high quality, and full of lots of good information. Also, you might have heard about the possibility of us doing a tab book. Well, we still haven't found a publisher for that.\"\"I practice the most when I have something I'm working on that's difficult, like one of Pat's songs for example. I usually won't practice for more than 3 or 4 hours a day unless I'm really inspired, or I have some kind of deadline.\"\n\nBesides playing bass, Alex has also contributed to lyric and music writing on many occasions for the band, some examples being \"Fucked with a Knife,\" \"Puncture Wound Massacre,\" \"I Will Kill You,\" \"Devoured by Vermin,\" \"Unleashing the Bloodthirsty,\" \"Scavenger consuming death,\" \"Scourge of iron\" and \"Murder Worship\".\nWebster is also known for his bass guitar solos/fills in such songs as \"Addicted to Vaginal Skin\", \"Mangled\", \"The Undead Will Feast\", \"Crushing the Despised\", \"Fucked with a Knife\", \"Hammer Smashed Face\", \"The Discipline of Revenge\", \"Put Them To Death\", \"She Was Asking For It\", \"Staring Through The Eyes of the Dead\", \"Bloodlands\", \"They Deserve to Die\", \"Rabid\", and \"The Strangulation Chair\".\nFrom 2013 to 2015 Webster wrote a monthly tuition column for the UK's Bass Guitar Magazine.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Adalbert is assumed to be of Polish origin.The territory was  put under the jurisdiction of the archbishopric of Magdeburg by Holy Roman emperor Otto I, King of Germany. In 1133 the Magdeburg archbishop Saint Norbert received verification by the pope of his jurisdiction over a number of dioceses, including those in Pomerania. However, bishop Otto of Bamberg had actually baptized the Pomeranians and therefore thought to add it to his southern Bamberg archdiocese and in order to avoid conflicts, pope Innocent II exempted the Pomeranian bishopric(s). \nOtto did not succeed during his lifetime in founding a diocese, due to a conflict between the archbishops of Magdeburg and Gniezno about ecclesiastical hegemony in the area. Pope Innocent II founded the diocese by a papal bull of 14 October 1140, and made the church of St. Adalbert at (Julin (Wollin/Wolin) on Wollin/Wolin island the see of the diocese. In the bull, the new diocese was placed \"under the protection of the see of the Holy Peter\", thwarting ambitions of the archbishops of Magdeburg and Gniezno, who both wanted to incorporate the new diocese as suffragan into their archdioceses.Otto had recommended his chaplain Adalbert as bishop, which was supported by Ratibor I, Duke of Pomerania. Adalbert was consecrated bishop at Rome. Adalbert and Ratibor I founded Stolpe Abbey at the side of Wartislaw I's assassination by a pagan in 1153, the first monastery in Pomerania. The new foundation was occupied by monks from Berge Abbey near Magdeburg and all churches to be built in the future were subordinated to it.\nIn 1147, the Wendish Crusade, a campaign of the Northern Crusades, was mounted by bishops and nobles of the Holy Roman Empire. The crusaders pillaged the land and besieged Demmin and Szczecin despite the fact that both towns were (officially) Christian already. Adalbert took part in the negotiations that finally led to the lifting of the Szczecin siege by the crusaders.After the death of Duke Ratibor I, Adalbert received the same support from his two nephews, Dukes Bogislaw I and Kasimir I. His last act was the confirmation of the richly gifted Grobe Monastery near Usedom, founded by Ratibor I, on 8 June 1159.\nWhen Wolin was destroyed by Danes in the late 12th century, the diocese was moved to Cammin (also Kammin, now Kamie\u0144 Pomorski ); this bishopric became known as the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kammin.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1905, the family moved to Argentina, settling in Santa Fe.After working a number of jobs, in 1913, the young Sinesio returned to Le\u00f3n and earned his bachelor's degree at a local university. After some travels around Catalonia and the Basque Country, in 1915, he enrolled at the University of Madrid, where he studied the humanities, graduating as a Doctor of Philosophy. In the Spanish capital, he began to live a bohemian lifestyle, taking the pseudonym Diego Abad de Santill\u00e1n while writing for dissident journals.Santill\u00e1n participated in the 1917 Spanish general strike, for which he was imprisoned for a year. After receiving an amnesty, he returned to Argentina, briefly reuniting with his family in Santa Fe before moving to the capital Buenos Aires. There he joined the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation (FORA), working as editor of its newspaper La Protesta. In 1922, he went to Germany and participated in the establishment of the International Workers' Association (IWA), staying behind in Berlin in order to study medicine. There he met a number of famous anarchists, including Max Nettlau, for whom he helped translate his works into Spanish. In 1925, he briefly went to Mexico and helped organise the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) before returning to Argentina, where he took part in the Sacco & Vanzetti defense campaign and wrote a history of anarchism in Argentina. In the wake of the 1930 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat, he was sentenced to death for sedition, but managed to escape into exile in the newly-established Spanish Republic.In Spain, Santill\u00e1n joined the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and became secretary of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI), for which he edited their respective newspapers Solidaridad Obrera and Tierra y Libertad. Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he joined the Central Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia and was appointed Minister of Economy in the Catalan government. In the wake of the May Days, he took a critical line against the government of Juan Negr\u00edn and the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), publishing After the Revolution, which outlined a program for workers' self-management under anarcho-syndicalism. In the program, Santill\u00e1n invoked British utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill in his attacks against capitalism, declaring:\n\nStuart Mill is right. We believe that such a society has no right to existence and we desire its total transformation. We want a socialized economy in which the land, the factories, the homes, the means of transport cease to be the monopoly of private ownership and become the collective property of the entire community.\nWhen the Republic was defeated, Santill\u00e1n fled into exile in France, before finally returning to Argentina. There he continued his historical work and contributed to dictionaries and encyclopedias, notably writing Why We Lost the War, which his son Luis later adapted into film. He largely ceased political activities and gravitated increasingly towards reformism, defending anarchist collaboration with the Republican government during the war, while also coming to prioritise the abolition of the state over the abolition of capitalism.During the Spanish transition to democracy, Santill\u00e1n finally returned to Spain, settling in Barcelona, where he died in 1983.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As a young man, Maurice Thomas first trained as a graphic designer and a magazine illustrator but was soon drawn to the theater. In 1904, he married the actress Fernande Petit. They had a son, Jacques (1904\u20131977), who would follow his father into the film industry, establishing his own reputation as a director of American films in the 1940s and 1950s.Using the stage name Maurice Tourneur, he began his show business career performing in secondary roles on stage and eventually toured England and South America as part of the theater company for the great star Gabrielle R\u00e9jane. Drawn to the new art of filmmaking, in 1911 he began working as an assistant director for the \u00c9clair company. A quick learner and an innovator, within a short time he was directing films on his own using major French stars of the day such as Polaire.\n\nIn 1914, with the expansion of the giant French film companies into the United States market, Tourneur moved to New York City to direct silent films for \u00c9clair's American branch studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey before moving to William A. Brady's World Film Corporation, where he directed important early American feature-length films such as The Wishing Ring, Alias Jimmy Valentine, The Cub (Martha Hedman's only screen performance) and Trilby, the last starring Clara Kimball Young and noted stage actor Wilton Lackaye as Svengali. Before long, Maurice Tourneur was a major and respected force in American film and a founding member of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association. As the feature film evolved in the mid 1910s, he and his team (comprising screenwriter Charles Maigne, art director Ben Carr\u00e9, and cameramen John van den Broek and Lucien Andriot) coupled exceptional technological skill with unique pictorial and architectural sensibilities in their productions, giving their films a visual distinctiveness that met with critical acclaim.\n\nTourneur admired D.W. Griffith and considered the skill level of American actors at the time ahead of their counterparts in Europe. Of the actresses he worked with, he called Mary Pickford the finest screen actress in the world and believed that stage actress Elsie Ferguson was a brilliant artist. However, Tourneur opposed the evolving star system that Carl Laemmle had begun with his advertising campaign for actress Florence Lawrence.\nAfter directing several innovative films for Adolph Zukor's Artcraft Pictures Corporation (which released through Paramount) in 1917 and 1918, Tourneur launched his own production company with the film Sporting Life. In 1921 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. By 1922 he believed that the future of the film industry lay in Hollywood and the following year he was hired by Samuel Goldwyn to go to the West Coast and make a film version of the Hall Caine novel The Christian. However, Tourneur's career in the United States faltered in the 1920s as his pictorialism sometimes hampered the narrative drive of his later films, and he also separated from his wife Fernande in 1923. He was removed from production on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's version of Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island in 1928, and this marked the end of his American career.\nAfter his trouble with MGM, Tourneur decided to move back to his native France. There, he continued to make films both at home and in Germany, easily making the change to talkies. In 1933 he met his second wife, actress Louise Lagrange (1898\u20131979), while shooting his film, L'Homme myst\u00e9rieux. Tourneur went on to direct another two dozen films, several of which were crime thrillers, until a 1949 automobile accident in which he was seriously injured and lost a leg. Health and age prevented him from directing more films, but a voracious reader and a skilled hobby artist, he kept busy painting and translating detective novels from English into French.\nAfter his death in 1961, Maurice Tourneur was interred in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\nMaurice Tourneur was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6243 Hollywood Blvd.\nHis 1917 film, The Poor Little Rich Girl, his 1918 film The Blue Bird and his 1920 film The Last of the Mohicans have since been deemed \"culturally significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Recently, the American Film Institute's Center for Film and Video Preservation and the National Archives of Canada have been cooperating on the restoration of Tourneur's 1915 film, The Cub.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is certainly true that every artist reveals something of himself-whether consciously or not-in whatever he/she produces.\nJohn Fletcher refers to Croak as Beckett's \"toppled Prospero . . . with Words as his Caliban and Music his Ariel.\"\nClas Zilliacus proposes that in this play, \"a mental process is unfolding,\" whereby Croak \"instigates two of his faculties, at odds with each other, to provide him with solace and entertainment.\" Zilliacus also offers a view of the play in the light of medieval lyric, suggesting that the \"master and servant motif familiar from other Beckett works here appears in recognisably feudal costume\".\nStefan-Brook Grant reminds us too that, \"Words and Music was a commissioned work from the Third Programme. Croak, therefore, can be interpreted as the commissioner of the play, while Words is Samuel Beckett's work and Music, John Beckett's. The two instruments, therefore, actually originate from separate sources, and are required to rehearse and combine forces in order to achieve a satisfactory rendering of certain themes.\"Ultimately most critics agree that Words and Music is a \"composition about composition\". Of course, a theme running through all of Beckett's writing has been the impossibility of meaningful expression through words alone and, in that respect, Joe doesn't disappoint. Croak wants to feel. He wants to wallow in a moment, exactly as Krapp does. He doesn't want to know. He doesn't need to understand. What is there to understand? Viewed purely as a means of communication, people revert to lovemaking to express their feelings, to \u2018say\u2019 what words can't say.\nIf Croak is a writer, or the personification of the creative aspect of a writer, then he demonstrates precious little control over his thoughts and his feelings. Perhaps he reflects Beckett's own, sometimes agonizing struggles with creativity when it appears at its most uncooperative. When the pair eventually do get their \"act\" together what is produced, which from all accounts is what Croak sought all along, is far too painful for him to bear.\n\"Words, in the end, are [Beckett\u2019s] material \u2013 not as literature but in terms of something akin to silence; the desire is not to control or empower but to listen. Words are a function of listening for Beckett, listening within a silence of being where the world is effaced.\"For Beckett, writing can be equated to seeing, it is a visual art that aspires to the ideal status of music: \"music is the idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena\", \"the ultimate imageless language of emotion.\" It is not so surprising then, when Katharine Worth asked Beckett about the relationship between the two figures in this radio play, he said: \"Music always wins.\" Similarly, Beckett told Theodor W. Adorno \"that it definitely ends with the victory of music\". In what way though? They struggle together to get to this point but is it meaning that has finally overpowered Croak or is it his reawakened feelings? Is this why Words are rendered speechless by the play's end?", "hasanswer": false}]}

She relocates to Wethersfield, Connecticut to live with her Aunt Rachel, Uncle Matthew, and her two cousins, Judith and Mercy, in their Puritan community.\nA brief stop is made in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, to pick up four new passengers. As the small rowboat returns to the ship, a young girl named Prudence accidentally drops her doll in the water and begs her harsh mother, Goodwife Cruff, to get it back for her. Impulsively, Kit jumps into the water and retrieves the doll. She is then met with astonished suspicion, as few white people in Connecticut could swim so well. Cruff is the most skeptical of them all, believing Kit is a witch, commenting, \"No respectable woman could stay afloat like that.\" On the slow trip upriver, Kit befriends John Holbrook, another passenger coming to Wethersfield to study with the Reverend Gershom Bulkeley.  \nKit finds Wethersfield very different from Barbados. Unlike at her previous home, where Kit's family owned servants and slaves, she is expected to work here along with the rest of the family. Her cousin Mercy has a lame leg and is on crutches. Kit is required to attend the Sabbath church meetings twice each Sunday, which she finds dull. Kit meets a rich young man, William Ashby.  He begins courting her, though she does not care for him. Originally, her cousin Judith had hoped to marry William, but she focuses on John Holbrook, a divinity student studying with Bulkeley.\nKit's life improves when she and Mercy begin teaching some young children of Wethersfield, who are preparing for traditional school. Everything proceeds well until one day, bored with the normal lessons, Kit decides the children will reenact a passage from the Bible: the parable of the Good Samaritan. The head of the school, Eleazer Kimberly, enters the house just as things get out of hand. He is outraged at Kit for having the audacity to act out something from the Bible and shuts down the school. Heartbroken, Kit flees to the meadows where she meets and befriends the kind, elderly Hannah Tupper, who was outlawed from the Massachusetts colony because she is a Quaker and does not attend church meetings, as well as being suspected of being a witch. With Hannah's support, Kit convinces Kimberly to give the school another chance.\nAs fellow outcasts, Kit and Hannah develop a deep bond, and even after her uncle forbids Kit to continue the friendship, she keeps visiting Hannah. During one of her visits, Kit again meets the handsome Nathaniel (Nat) Eaton, son of the captain of the Dolphin. Without realizing it, she falls in love with him, and though he doesn't say so, Nat reciprocates. Unfortunately, Nat is banished from Wethersfield after setting lit jack-o-lanterns in the windows of William Ashby's unfinished home. Nat is threatened with 30 lashes if he returns to Wethersfield. Kit also begins secretly teaching Prudence to read and write; Goodwife Cruff claims the child is a half-wit and \"stupid\" and refuses to allow her to attend the dame school.\nWhen a deadly illness sweeps through Wethersfield, a mob gathers to kill Hannah by burning her house. Kit rushes to warn Hannah, and the two women escape to the river just as the Dolphin appears from the early morning mist. Kit flags it down.  Nat takes Hannah aboard and invites Kit to come with them. She refuses, explaining that Mercy is gravely ill, though Nat believes Kit fears losing her engagement to William Ashby.\nAfter the Dolphin sails away, Kit returns home to find that Mercy's fever has broken. In the middle of the same night, the townspeople come for Kit; Goodwife Cruff's husband has accused her of being a witch. The next day, after a freezing night in the sheriff's shed, Kit is asked to explain the presence of her hornbook in Hannah's house and a copybook with Prudence's name written throughout, as the townspeople fear that she and Hannah were casting a spell over the girl. Kit refuses to reveal that Prudence wrote her own name, as Kit does not wish to cause the girl trouble with her parents. \nJust as Kit seems to be declared guilty, Nat appears with Prudence, who testifies that Kit was only giving her lessons. To demonstrate her literacy, Prudence reads a Bible passage and writes her name, thus convincing her father both that she is intelligent, and that no witchcraft could be involved, as the devil would be foolish to allow a child to be taught to use the Bible against herself. While Nat is initially in trouble for returning and evades capture, Kit's Uncle Matthew intervenes on his behalf and gets the punishment dropped as a reward for Nat returning to see justice done at great risk to himself.\nSoon after, Kit breaks off her engagement to William.  Two engagements are announced: Mercy to John Holbrook and Judith to William Ashby. Kit decides to return to Barbados. However, she decides to talk to Nat first after finally realizing that she's in love with him. Nat returns to Wethersfield with a surprise: he is the captain of a new boat. The boat is called the Witch, named after Kit. Kit asks to come on board the Witch, but Nat says no, until he gets her Uncle Matthew's permission to marry her.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Since Garble is an old enemy, while Mr. Boom is a friend, Freddy visits the circus to warn him. Garble allows limited viewing of the Martians, so he must be lured away while Freddy's cohort Mrs. Peppercorn sneaks in. She finds the bearded Martians dressed in red costumes with gloves, and oddly \"like a dog walking on its hind legs\". The Martian introduces himself, spelling his name S-i-m-g-h-k (with a silent \"i\"). Inexplicably, Simghk is familiar with Freddy's poetry. He flatters Peppercorn, who eagerly explains she can do better:\n\n\"No, sir, my idea of poetry is something that everybody ain't done before. You don't use the old rhymes, like 'love' and 'dove' and 'eyes' and 'sighs.' You make words rhyme that nobody has ever rhymed before.\"She recites her several thousand line poem, starting, \"Some stars are large, some stars are small / And some are quite invisiball\". The Martians are bored asleep. Later, Freddy is successful investigating: in getting the \"Martians\" to agree that Mars is nearer the sun than the Earth, he realizes they must be fakes. However, as the reputation of Boom's circus would be at risk, Freddy does not tell the owner what they discovered.\nWilly, the circus boa constrictor, is sleeping over at Freddy's. They are awoken by the chickens Charles and Henrietta, who accuse the snake of abducting their chicks. This sends Freddy into detective mode. In confirming that the revolving chicken house door cannot be entered by the large snake, he is stuck, squeals loudly, and rouses the barnyard. Dogs, tracking rat smell, find a hole. Willy slithers in, retrieving Simon the rat, Freddy's longstanding foe. Shortly after they hold Simon captive, Garble announces that one of his Martians is missing. Garble reveals that he purchased the Grimsby property next to the Bean farm, and is demanding Uncle Ben Bean remove his space ship (built in Freddy and the Space Ship). Freddy deduces that Garble's false Martians are actually rats and threatens to reveal Garble's hoax unless the space ship is allowed to remain. Besides, they cannot expose the fake Martians without embarrassing the circus. However Freddy's philosophy is \"When everything seems hopeless, the thing to do is stir it up good.\"\nFreddy devises a plan to use a rabbit to replace the fake Martian rat that was captured. The rats remaining in the circus are not fooled, but Jinx the cat remains in their cage, forcing them to cooperate. When the crowd does not notice the difference, Freddy has all the \"Martian\" rats replaced with his \"Martian\" rabbits. Freddy investigates the Grimsby property with the help of an ex-burglar, however they are confined by Garble in his cellar.\nWholly unexpectedly, real Martians land, having come to examine the fake Martians, and to look at Uncle Ben's space ship. They are pear-shaped, have three eyes and four arms, and are entirely friendly. There are at an impasse communicating until it is discovered that spiders such as the elderly Mr. and Mrs. Webb can speak with them.\nFreddy discovers the missing chicks are in the Garble cellar. As a ruse, Freddy spreads strawberry jam on the burglar and shouts for help. The burglar escapes, believing Freddy has too. The Martians take the first of several joy rides, landing finally at the circus, where they are amused by the false Martians. After a time they realize Freddy still needs rescuing, so the sheriff, the Martians, and circus folk overwhelm Garble's house, freeing Freddy and the chicks. Garble escapes to join his confederates, the rats. Rats being difficult to dislodge, Freddy makes use of ten sacks of rotten onions to taint the food at the Garble place. The rats retaliate by invading the space ship, and eating the stores.

He is never referred to by name in the play itself but he is well named. Joe addresses to him \u2013 albeit somewhat obsequiously \u2013 as, \"My Lord,\" since, despite his apparent frailty, he has plainly been someone used to wielding authority. There are only three sound effects used in the entire play, the shuffle [Beckett's descriptive stage direction) of Croak's feet as he arrives and departs, the thud/dropping of his club (staff?) reminiscent of the rulers wielded by the Animator in Rough for Radio II and the music teacher in Embers and the rapping of Music's baton reminiscent of a once prevalent practice among conductors of the past which is now far less widespread. The club and baton function as objects of authority. They form an interesting dyad prominently employed throughout the play.\nFor entertainment, Croak, (a Beckettian \u2018old King Cole\u2019) has only two old stalwarts to call on, his minstrels, Joe (Words) and Bob (Music). Each is heard to be possibly an abstraction and/or a being of some sort manifested through their respective vocabularies (music/words). Do they have actual physical form? This remains an unanswerable question. With radio remaining a solely sonic medium, we can only conjecture (Beckett sets up similar uncertainty in much of his work). Words/Music function in a way resembling court artists/musicians of the past. Word's repeatedly addressing Croak as \"My Lord\" and the strange formality to the domination both Words/Joe and Music/Bob seem accustomed to enduring adds an ancient (medieval?) or primitively regal aspect to the proceedings.\nThe modern shortened names (Joe, Bob) add a humorous contemporary contrast to the generally ancient (or timeless) seeming circumstances. The source of Croak's power over them is never explained or questioned-adding to the mysterious atmosphere.\nAlfred Alvarez refers to Croak as \"a poet\" though there is no real evidence to suggest that he is. In fact his utterances throughout the play are terse: moans, groans and murmurings mainly along with a few short lines (commands, entreaties or outbursts). That said, he appears to appreciate poetry especially when set to music. The first theme Croak proclaims for the evening's diversion is \"Love.\" Beckett offers several clues to help imagine Croak as a specific character. His shuffling feet, choice of themes, self-torturing reminiscence and intense reactions to much of what Words and Music produce/perform all seem to indicate that he is a decrepit version of Orsino with his famous opening line from Twelfth Night: \"If music be the food of love, play on,\" a hopeless romantic, in love with love, and the melancholy brought on by the mere thought of it. Croak could almost be the selfsame man, had he never moved from that spot for the rest of his life and now finds himself perhaps approaching the brink of death. Or does this gathering occur again and again outside time? So many Beckett works present characters seemingly caught in endless cycles of repetition (those who wait in \"Waiting for Godot\"/the appearing-disappearing woman in \"Ill Seen Ill Said\"/The urn-dwelling trio in \"Play\" etc.) that this is always a possibility.\nAdditional related aspects of Love that Croak focuses on as sub-themes are \"Age,\" \"Face,\" (With two foreshadowing mentions earlier on in the play-once by Croak and then latter by Words) and the climactic naming of \"Lily\" which is discussed later regarding its various implications. After this iteration Croak is reduced to groans, an anguished \"No!\" and the eventual dropping of his \"club\" followed by shuffling away. His entrance/exit frames the main body of the play.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He can play at exceptionally fast speeds, and does a signature 3-finger walk (a \"galloping\" finger motion). He revealed in a making-of DVD for Cannibal Corpse's album The Wretched Spawn that he initially started playing guitar but changed to bass because he felt he could master the instrument more quickly. Unlike usual heavy metal bassists that play at high speeds, Webster is able to play his instrument without the use of a pick, while still retaining a clean clear tone, which helps maintain clarity in the complex and very fast lines he plays in conjunction with the heavily distorted guitars of Cannibal Corpse.\n\n\"When I was six years old I took some acoustic guitar lessons. It didn't really work out because I was six and didn't really want to learn \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" and those were the kind of songs I was being taught. I wanted to play Elvis. I liked all the old 50s music. My dad had a bunch of old 50s records because that's when he was a teenager. Those were what I listened to, because when you're six you don't have the money to go buy stuff, so I just listened to his records. Nobody was going to teach me how to play the guitar like that, out in the country where I lived. I just gave it up until I was 13 or 14. I met a kid in school who played bass in the high school jazz band. He wanted to make some extra money and it was five bucks a lesson. He did a good job too. His name was Mike Hudson. I don't know if he plays anymore. I lost touch with him. He's the one that got me started. I always wanted to play in a band, and to learn how to play lead guitar was going to take like five years. But I really liked the sound of the bass. I liked AC/DC and figured I could do that. I thought I could learn Cliff Williams' bass parts faster than I could learn to play Angus Young's guitar parts. It was motivation, because I wanted to be in a band. I never wanted to sit around and play music by myself. I wanted to play with other people, and the fastest route to that was playing an instrument that wasn't a lead instrument, and bass was that. Now I've learned to make it a lot more difficult. I've made my job a lot harder than it probably needs to be. But it's just fun. In the beginning my concern was playing in a band.\"\"I took some lessons from a friend of mine when I first started. He was in the school jazz band and he taught me the basics. I didn't take lessons for about a year, but I started again when I was a senior in high school. I've had about four different teachers throughout the years, but I never took lessons for more than a few months. I did, however, gain a lot from them and I've tried to learn as much on my own as I can. Anything I can learn about music or bass playing, I'll try to learn. I mean, the more you learn and the more you apply to your playing, it just makes you a better musician.\"\"I liked the bass player from AC/DC. I really loved the stuff he did. Peter Baltes from Accept was another. I liked the really good guys too, but that seemed out of reach at the beginning. Geddy Lee from Rush and Steve Harris were like gods to me. Billy Sheehan was from Buffalo, and we all knew about Billy before the rest of the country did. Billy has been a legend in Buffalo for a long, long time. He's still one of my favorites. By the time I was listening to Cliff Burton I was getting a little better. I had been playing a year or so before I started listening to Metallica. I thought he was great. I always thought he could have been a little louder on those albums though. That's the thing. In thrash metal or any other kind of metal where the bass is playing exactly what the guitar is playing, automatically the bass went down in the mix. If you notice those older bands like Accept, the bass is doing something that's a little bit different from the guitar. It's more with the kick drum instead of playing the riff the guitar is doing. In thrash metal and then death metal, the bass player always wound up playing what the guitar player was doing most of the time. It's been a decade long fight for us to be heard in the mix.\"\"I'd like to do some instructional material, but I'm still not sure if I'll try and do a DVD or book though. It will probably be easier to do a DVD, actually. Hopefully I'll be able to come up with some stuff that's worth releasing. I definitely won't put anything out until I'm sure it's of really high quality, and full of lots of good information. Also, you might have heard about the possibility of us doing a tab book. Well, we still haven't found a publisher for that.\"\"I practice the most when I have something I'm working on that's difficult, like one of Pat's songs for example. I usually won't practice for more than 3 or 4 hours a day unless I'm really inspired, or I have some kind of deadline.\"\n\nBesides playing bass, Alex has also contributed to lyric and music writing on many occasions for the band, some examples being \"Fucked with a Knife,\" \"Puncture Wound Massacre,\" \"I Will Kill You,\" \"Devoured by Vermin,\" \"Unleashing the Bloodthirsty,\" \"Scavenger consuming death,\" \"Scourge of iron\" and \"Murder Worship\".\nWebster is also known for his bass guitar solos/fills in such songs as \"Addicted to Vaginal Skin\", \"Mangled\", \"The Undead Will Feast\", \"Crushing the Despised\", \"Fucked with a Knife\", \"Hammer Smashed Face\", \"The Discipline of Revenge\", \"Put Them To Death\", \"She Was Asking For It\", \"Staring Through The Eyes of the Dead\", \"Bloodlands\", \"They Deserve to Die\", \"Rabid\", and \"The Strangulation Chair\".\nFrom 2013 to 2015 Webster wrote a monthly tuition column for the UK's Bass Guitar Magazine.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His first known individual design is the Church of the New Jerusalem, a board-and-batten Gothic Revival church built at Glendale in 1861.\nAfter serving with the Union army during the American Civil War, Mullett in 1863 relocated to Washington. He worked again with Rogers, since 1862 the de facto Supervising Architect at the Treasury Department. At that time the Treasury Department oversaw design and construction of all federal buildings. Mullett undermined his superior's position until an exasperated Rogers resigned in 1865. That year Mullet married Pacific Pearl Myrick.\nAlthough widely dismissed as \"an obscure draftsman\" from Cincinnati, Mullett used his political skills to gain appointment as Supervising Architect in 1866. He designed fireproof federal buildings across the nation, particularly custom houses, post offices and courthouses. Responsible for contracting with local architects and/or construction companies to deal with subcontractors, source materials and other matters, Mullett was known as a micromanaging authoritarian with an explosive temper.Influenced by the 1864\u20131868 remodeling of the Louvre's Pavillon de Flore  by Hector Lefuel and Richard Morris Hunt, Mullett produced six massive fortress-like Second Empire federal buildings in St. Louis, Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, New York and Washington D.C.  What was called the State, War, and Navy Building rose near the White House. These stone and cast iron structures, with mansard roofs and multiple tiers of columns, were expensive.

The group called themselves by various names, the most notable being \"The Pleasure Fair\" and by 1966 they managed to obtain a recording contract for a single with Hanna Barbera Records under the name \"The Rainy Day People\".  \"Junior Executive\" was the \"A\" side, backed with \"I'm Telling It To You\" (both songs written by Cohn, Hallinan and Royer) The group signed a recording contract with Uni Records in 1967 David Gates was hired as the arranger and conductor for the Pleasure Fair's self-titled album.

{"id": "106_618", "question": "What kind of work does Saul Singer do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_7328", "text": "The documentary opens with an introduction by Tilda Swinton, who gives a backstory about Bj\u00f6rk's career and her intention with the Biophilia project, stating that the singer conceived the project wanting to redefine music in the 21st Century. Images from the \"Moon and \"Mutual Core\" music videos accompany her speech. After that, some frames focus on the Graduale Nobili who are singing the backing vocals to \"Thunderbolt\" on a cliff in front of the ocean in Iceland. Thereafter the scene shifts to an early rehearsal of the Biophilia songs in Iceland during November 2010. The choir begin to learn their parts in \"Thunderbolt\" and \"Moon\" under the guide of the singer. After that, the documentary shows the encounter between Bj\u00f6rk and Sir David Attenborough in the Natural History Museum in London. There, the naturalist and the singer discuss about the nature of music. They first talk about the importance of music and singing in the nature, with Attenborough explaining how music works for birds like the bird-of-paradise and the lyrebird, whose chirping is defined by the naturalist the \"most complex sound ever\", and he goes on by stating that the bird has developed an \"impressive vocal range\" which he compares to that of Bj\u00f6rk. Attenborough states that the human larynx is capable of many more sounds that preceded language. Therefore, the singer asks him how he thinks music works for the modern people, and the naturalist explains how he thinks popular music is \"extremely sexual\", comparing popular music to medieval troubadors, and that is why is so relatable to young people and animals, i.e. the gibbons, which mate by singing together out of excitement. Attenborough affirms that \"the mystery is how music has been used by humanity for something that is transcendental\".\nFootage from another rehearsal with the choir singing \"Dark Matter\" are shown before shifting to the encounter between Bj\u00f6rk and Henry Dagg in a metal workshop. Dagg had created the Sharpsichord, a solar powered cross between a harp and a barrel organ, which Bj\u00f6rk wanted to incorporate in one song. They are shown rehearsing \"Sacrifice\" and discussing the composition of the song. Attenborough states that our emotion comes from nature and that a composer has to be in contact with it. He then manages to compare the sound of Benjamin Britten's Sea interludes (which is playing in the background) to the sound of waves. The natural structure of music inspires Bj\u00f6rk who wants to bring nature in her composition. To discuss \"Crystalline\", Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough go to the crystal room of the museum. They talk about the mathematical basis of Bj\u00f6rk's songs, who explains the time signatures of the verses and the chorus of \"Crystalline\" and compares the composition of a crystal to that of a song. Scenes from the choir recording parts of \"Crystalline\" guided by Biophilia musical director Matt Robertson are shown. Attenborough thinks that the beauty of mathematics can be heard in composition like the \"Fugue 5\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. Swinton tells how universe is made of patterns which are present in music but that we can't visualise, and how Bj\u00f6rk wants to change that. Because of that, the singer collaborates with Evan Grant, who works with cymatics. Grant explains how the Chladni plate works, and that he appreciates how Bj\u00f6rk tries to bring a real meaning in her music by taking a \"scientific and realistic approach\" to it. Grant tries to use cymatics on water for \"Crystalline\", which results can be seen in the music video for the song (directed by Michel Gondry).\nSwinton explains how Bj\u00f6rk's aim is to bring nature on stage for the Biophilia performance. Footage from the final rehearsal at Campfield Market Hall in Manchester for Biophilia world premiere at the Manchester International Festival is shown, with the Sharpsichord arriving at the venue. Some of other instruments used during the show are presented, like MIDI-controlled Tesla coil, invented by Nikola Tesla, and a gravity-harnessed pendulum harp invented by Andy Cavatorta of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Cavatorta recounts how Bj\u00f6rk declared to him that she wanted nature to appear like \"some sort of a rock star on stage\", and tells that the first prototypes of the instruments were filmed and shown to Bj\u00f6rk before she approved the final result. In one of the prototypes video the inventor puts a figurine of Bj\u00f6rk (as pictured in the Volta album cover) between the swings. The instrument, created solely for the \"Solstice\" performance, was commissioned because, as Bj\u00f6rk declares, the singer \"got obsessed\" with basslines (she hums a bassline of a composition by John Tavener as she says so).\n\nOne of the major inspiration of the project itself, neurologist Oliver Sacks, who Bj\u00f6rk define as the \"David Attenborough of the brain\", lists the benefits music has on human and explains how when a human listens to music every part of the brain gets involved. This is very useful to people who suffers from dementia, who need evocative music which can help them in building a bridge to their past. Scenes from a nursing home, in which various patients with dementia are shown to benefit from different music played to them, accompany Sacks' speech. He affirms that the music expresses something that language can't.\nScenes from the first performance of Biophilia are shown. David Attenborough's intro, which accompany the show, is partially heard, while Bj\u00f6rk affirms that music is a catalyst between the outer world and the inner world. A performance of \"Thunderbolt\" is partially shown, during which the singer is seen wearing a dress by Michael van der Ham, along with a big red wig, while the Tesla coil plays on stage. Swinton states that Biophilia \"nature, music and technology come together\" and that the Icelandic singer wants to develop a new kind of music-making which is \"intuitive and accessible for everyone\". This is driven by her desire to change we think of music, because, as the singer herself explains, by recounting her musical education, the \"academic approach to music is a barrier to people actually making music\". Oliver Sacks agrees with her by stating that the sheet music and the keys of a piano are \"intimidating and much more complicated than language\". Because of that, the singer tries to use technology to make it more intuitive. As a consequence of this, Bj\u00f6rk works with Damian Taylor. Taylor tries to use a ball and a cardboard box, along with a gamepad, instead of a keyboard. Bj\u00f6rk's solution came with the diffusion of tablet computer, which touch screen the singer compares to a tambourine for its being spontaneous and instinctive. By developing this idea, she decides to make a different format of album, made with apps. She works with interactive media artist Scott Snibbe, who states that her aim is the turn music \"into something full sensory\".\nBj\u00f6rk explains some of the apps that are part of the album, like \"Moon\", which app deals with sequences, \"Mutual Core\", in which chords are represented with strata, and \"Thunderbolt\", which use lightnings as visual representation of arpeggios. Bj\u00f6rk states that a famous example of arpeggio is \"I Feel Love\" by Donna Summer. Snibbe then affirms that, \"if we change the visual representation, the way in which people think about music is changed\". To engage people with her new conception of music, Bj\u00f6rk rolls out a programme of music workshops for children in school around the world (footage from a workshop in Buenos Aires is shown) which, as Swinton informs, is now a standard part of the music curriculum in Iceland. Bj\u00f6rk confesses that she always dreamt about running a music school and that she considers this project her music school. After one year from the first show in Manchester, the Biophilia Tour reaches the World Sacred Music Festival in Fes, Morocco, during which Bj\u00f6rk is seen performing \"Cosmogony\". Sacks finally states that \"music unify people at an elementary level\". The documentary ends with a final conversation between Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough, in which the naturalist affirms:\n\n\"Music, to be most rewarding, [...] does require work, and does require concentration, does require thought, which is why your music is so challenging, because it does require thought. So much of what you do, is completely new, [and] hasn't been done by people before, and that's what's challenging about that. So, if you're very tired, I don't suggest that they put on your music. I put on your music when I really want to think about something.\"\nTo which Bj\u00f6rk blushes, and then the pair laugh together. The end credits roll to \"Cosmogony\" in the background.", "hasanswer": false}]}

[...] It's hard to take a body count of all those ideas which freefall off every page but then 'the thing to do is to walk in circles.' And occasionally pause. . . .\" In The New York Times Book Review, Thomas R. Edwards deemed End Zone an improvement over Americana and said that the writing \"is continuously energetic, shifty, fun to watch for its own sake.\u201d Edwards also argued that \"[Gary's] fever, casually introduced in the final paragraph, hints at the uncertain but possible value of vulnerability, persisting without certitude in a world where others accept defensive systems \u2014technologies, religion, games, the large or small cultisms that flourish where fear is.\u201dAnya Taylor at The City University of New York argued the book would endure, especially praising Gary's desert meditation on the end zone. Taylor discussed how the novel dramatizes certain limitations of language and negative social phenomena involving language (such as the covering of unpleasant truths through euphemisms, or the prevention of meaningful interaction through over-reliance on simplistic maxims), and interpreted the novel as \"a book about the decline of language under the bombardment of terms from thermonuclear warfare, and an attempt to revive language through an ascetic disciplined ritual of silence and self-loss\". Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of The New York Times stated that End Zone confirmed DeLillo as one of the best young writers of his time, writing that the author was skilled at building scenes for comedic effect and praising the football game that is considered the novel's centerpiece as well as the pick-up game in the snow.Bill Beckett of The Harvard Crimson was less positive. While writing that End Zone has perhaps the best extended account of a football game ever written, and that the novel shows the author's \"golden ear for the tin and tinsel of Americanese\", Beckett also argued that \"even isolated good satire can't hold together a disappointingly anticlimactic novel. DeLillo's buildup of suspense finally dissipates totally; many ominous hints are lost or forgotten by the end. [...] A season in the chaotic life of Gary Harkness, interesting as he is, does not suffice to make a satisfying whole.\"Chad Harbach lauded End Zone in 2004 as \"a wonderful and underrated novel\". Daniel Roberts highly praised the novel in a 2018 retrospective for The Paris Review, where he wrote, \"No novel nails the omnipresent violence of football better than End Zone\". In 2007, however, the novel was listed by New York as one of the DeLillo's works that is \"for fans only\": \"There\u2019s little plot to speak of in this second novel, just a series of hilarious riffs on the parallels between football and nuclear war. That\u2019s not the most original comparison to draw, and the ending\u2014or rather, the lack of one\u2014makes it an ultimately unsatisfying read.\"  In 2011, Martin Amis listed End Zone among his favorite novels in DeLillo\u2019s output. Jeff Somers conversely ranked it 10th out of 17 of the author\u2019s books, arguing that it was extremely funny but also that \"there\u2019s not much of a story here, and after meandering about for a while, it sort of just stops dead in its tracks.\"\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

Son of the vicar Erich Rosenius and of Anna Wekander, he studied at the Gymnasium of Gothenburg and when he was 16 years old at Lund University under Kilian Stobaeus, and in Uppsala. In 1727, he was appointed as a lecturer at the Uppsala University, replacing Petrus Martin who had recently died. Ros\u00e9n had already worked as an assistant to professor Olof Rudbeck at the time. But he couldn't take up this position until 1731, spending those four years traveling and studying abroad in Germany, Italy, France, and the Netherlands, where he studied for a while under Friedrich Hoffmann, Herman Boerhaave and Pieter van Musschenbroek. He stayed for a year in Geneva in Switzerland with Albrecht von Haller. In 1730, Ros\u00e9n stayed in Harderwijk where he received his medical degree with his work De historiis morborum rite consignandis. He returned to Uppsala on 1 March 1731. He was at one point Carl Linnaeus's rival, who was one year younger than Ros\u00e9n. While they were working at Uppsala University, they aimed for the same position as the other. This led to a strained relationship, with Ros\u00e9n on the one hand teaching Linnaeus medicine, but on the other trying to take over the demonstrations Linnaeus gave at the botanical gardens. At one time, Ros\u00e9n had Linnaeus expelled from the university for supposedly lecturing without the necessary qualifications, after which an enraged Linnaeus tried to stab him with a sword. Eventually, they would both hold one of the chairs of medicine and cooperate on more friendly terms. In 1740, Ros\u00e9n succeeded Olof Rudbeck as professor of medicine at Uppsala University. Taking on the responsibility for the fields of physiology, anatomy, and practical medicine, while Ros\u00e9n and Linnaeus were together responsible for pathology and chemistry. Originally, they held reverse positions (Ros\u00e9n had botany, and Linnaeus anatomy and pathology), but considering their specialties and main interests, they switched places in 1742. As their mutual animosity died down they became colleagues, eventually becoming friends, with Ros\u00e9n treating Linnaeus when he suffered from the so-called \"Uppsala Fever\" or pleurisy in 1764, and Linnaeus returning the favor two years later.\nHe was First Physician to the King of Sweden by 1743, retaining this title under Frederick of Sweden, Adolf Frederick of Sweden, and Gustav III of Sweden.

Digby Diehl of the Times referred to the band's sound as \"a hypnotic m\u00e9lange\" and further wrote that: \"The flute and harpsichord jazz improvisations on numbers such as 'Stephanie Knows Who' and 'Orange Skies' lend a fresh lift to what might be an ordinary rock piece.\" A later review from the paper placed the band's \"clean\" presentation and \"balance of instruments and roles\" with those of the Beatles and Buffalo Springfield. Echols remembered the band's performances with the expanded lineup as \"probably the most fun we had playing.\"Da Capo was first announced as an album on November 12, 1966, with an advertisement placed by Elektra on page 1 of Billboard magazine. By late January 1967 when Da Capo was listed by Billboard as a \"New Action Album\", \"7 and 7 Is\" had already received commercial and critical success, helping to boost the album's sales. It entered the Billboard Top LPs chart on February 11, 1967, and peaked at number 80 on April 8, failing to achieve the commercial success the band had hoped it would. Lee blamed the album's disappointing performance on Elektra, but Botnick disagreed, saying, \"Arthur wouldn't go out and promote it!\" Stuart later reflected that the band \"should have toured behind it\"; however, he recognized that Lee \"prided himself on being different. If bands toured after releasing an album, he would do it differently.\" Regarding the album as \"an undeniably groundbreaking release for 1966\" with a style that had \"no other context or reference in [rock] up to that point\", Einarson asks if Lee had \"overestimated his own audience with a body of music perhaps too complex and esoteric for their tastes\". In the observation of writer Jim Bickhart, \"by that point, Arthur had shown he was kind of oblivious to who his audience was and how to appeal to them ... he was not thinking, 'I'm going to bring my audience along with me,' he was just thinking, 'I'm going to do what I'm going to do.'\"Da Capo received favorable recognition from contemporary reviewers. David Harris of Mojo-Navigator called it \"a great advance\" over Love's debut album and recognized their \"integration of jazz and [rock] into a new form of music.\" In a more critical review for Esquire magazine, Robert Christgau felt that, although \"7 and 7 Is\" was a \"perfect rocker\", the rest of side one \"sounds cluttered and lacks sock\", directing the latter criticism to Lee's voice being \"more often too sweet for his material.\" Of \"Revelation\", Christgau wrote: \"It includes excellent guitar and harmonica work and great screaming ...

The Lennons exited their limousine on 72nd Street instead of driving into the more secure courtyard of the Dakota. They passed Chapman and walked toward the archway entrance of the building. As Ono passed by, Chapman nodded at her. As Lennon passed by, he glanced briefly at Chapman, appearing to recognise him from earlier. Seconds later, Chapman drew his revolver, which was concealed in his coat pocket, aimed at the center of Lennon's back, and rapidly fired five hollow-point bullets from a distance of about nine to ten feet (2.7\u20133.0 m).\nBased on statements made that night by New York City Police Department (NYPD) Chief of Detectives James Sullivan, numerous reports at the time claimed that Chapman called out \"Mr. Lennon\" and dropped into a combat stance before firing. Later court hearings and witness interviews did not include either of these details. Chapman said that he does not remember calling out to Lennon before he fired, and that Lennon did not turn around. He claimed to have taken a combat stance in a 1992 interview with Barbara Walters.\nOne bullet missed Lennon and struck a window of the Dakota. According to the autopsy report, two bullets entered the left side of Lennon's back, travelling through the left side of his chest and his left lung with one exiting from the body and one lodged in his neck. Two more bullets hit Lennon in his left shoulder. Lennon, bleeding profusely from his external wounds and from his mouth, staggered up five steps to the lobby where he said, \"I'm shot! I'm shot!\" He then fell to the floor, scattering cassettes that he was carrying.Jose Perdomo, the doorman, shook the revolver out of Chapman's hand and kicked it across the pavement. Concierge worker Jay Hastings first started to make a tourniquet, but upon ripping open Lennon's blood-stained shirt and realising the severity of his injuries, he covered Lennon's chest with his uniform jacket, removed his blood-covered glasses, and summoned the police. Chapman removed his coat and hat to show that he was not carrying any concealed weapons and remained standing on 72nd Street, waiting for police to arrive. Underneath his coat, he wore a promotional T-shirt for Todd Rundgren's album Hermit of Mink Hollow. Perdomo shouted at Chapman, \"Do you know what you just did?\" to which Chapman calmly replied, \"I just shot John Lennon.\"Officers Steven Spiro and Peter Cullen were the first policemen to arrive at the scene; they were at 72nd Street and Broadway when they heard a report of shots fired at the Dakota. The officers arrived around two minutes after the shooting and found Chapman standing very calmly on 72nd Street reading a paperback copy of The Catcher in the Rye. They immediately put Chapman in handcuffs and placed him in the back seat of their squad car. Chapman made no attempt to flee or resist arrest. Cullen said of Chapman: \"He apologized to us for ruining our night. I turned around and said to him, 'You've got to be fucking kidding me. You're worried about our night? Do you know what you just did to your life?' We read him his rights more than once.\"Officers Herb Frauenberger and Tony Palma were the second team to arrive on the scene. They found Lennon lying face down on the floor of the lobby, blood pouring from his mouth and his clothing already soaked with it, with Hastings attending to him. Officers James Moran and Bill Gamble soon arrived as well. Frauenberger put Lennon in their car, concluding his condition was too serious to wait for an ambulance to arrive. Moran and Gamble then drove Lennon to Roosevelt Hospital on West 59th Street, followed by Frauenberger and Palma, who drove Ono to that location. According to Gamble, in the car, Moran asked, \"Are you John Lennon?\" or, \"Do you know who you are?\" Lennon nodded, but could only manage to make a moaning and gurgling sound when he tried to speak, and lost consciousness shortly thereafter.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His exact flightpath is not known, nor how long he was in the air, because today's abbey is not the abbey of the 11th century, when it was probably smaller, although the tower was probably close to the present height. \"Olivers Lane\", off the present-day High Street and about 200 metres (660 ft) from the abbey, is reputed locally to be the site where Eilmer landed. That would have taken him over many buildings. Maxwell Woosnam's study concluded that he is more likely to have descended the steep hill off to the southwest of the abbey, rather than the town centre to the south.Eilmer used a bird-like apparatus to glide downwards against the breeze. However, being unable to balance himself forward and backwards, as does a bird by slight movements of its wings, head and legs, he would have needed a large tail to maintain equilibrium. Eilmer could not have achieved true soaring flight, but he might have glided down safely with a tail. Eilmer said he had \"forgotten to provide himself with a tail.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He can play at exceptionally fast speeds, and does a signature 3-finger walk (a \"galloping\" finger motion). He revealed in a making-of DVD for Cannibal Corpse's album The Wretched Spawn that he initially started playing guitar but changed to bass because he felt he could master the instrument more quickly. Unlike usual heavy metal bassists that play at high speeds, Webster is able to play his instrument without the use of a pick, while still retaining a clean clear tone, which helps maintain clarity in the complex and very fast lines he plays in conjunction with the heavily distorted guitars of Cannibal Corpse.\n\n\"When I was six years old I took some acoustic guitar lessons. It didn't really work out because I was six and didn't really want to learn \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" and those were the kind of songs I was being taught. I wanted to play Elvis. I liked all the old 50s music. My dad had a bunch of old 50s records because that's when he was a teenager. Those were what I listened to, because when you're six you don't have the money to go buy stuff, so I just listened to his records. Nobody was going to teach me how to play the guitar like that, out in the country where I lived. I just gave it up until I was 13 or 14. I met a kid in school who played bass in the high school jazz band. He wanted to make some extra money and it was five bucks a lesson. He did a good job too. His name was Mike Hudson. I don't know if he plays anymore. I lost touch with him. He's the one that got me started. I always wanted to play in a band, and to learn how to play lead guitar was going to take like five years. But I really liked the sound of the bass. I liked AC/DC and figured I could do that. I thought I could learn Cliff Williams' bass parts faster than I could learn to play Angus Young's guitar parts. It was motivation, because I wanted to be in a band. I never wanted to sit around and play music by myself. I wanted to play with other people, and the fastest route to that was playing an instrument that wasn't a lead instrument, and bass was that. Now I've learned to make it a lot more difficult. I've made my job a lot harder than it probably needs to be. But it's just fun. In the beginning my concern was playing in a band.\"\"I took some lessons from a friend of mine when I first started. He was in the school jazz band and he taught me the basics. I didn't take lessons for about a year, but I started again when I was a senior in high school. I've had about four different teachers throughout the years, but I never took lessons for more than a few months. I did, however, gain a lot from them and I've tried to learn as much on my own as I can. Anything I can learn about music or bass playing, I'll try to learn. I mean, the more you learn and the more you apply to your playing, it just makes you a better musician.\"\"I liked the bass player from AC/DC. I really loved the stuff he did. Peter Baltes from Accept was another. I liked the really good guys too, but that seemed out of reach at the beginning. Geddy Lee from Rush and Steve Harris were like gods to me. Billy Sheehan was from Buffalo, and we all knew about Billy before the rest of the country did. Billy has been a legend in Buffalo for a long, long time. He's still one of my favorites. By the time I was listening to Cliff Burton I was getting a little better. I had been playing a year or so before I started listening to Metallica. I thought he was great. I always thought he could have been a little louder on those albums though. That's the thing. In thrash metal or any other kind of metal where the bass is playing exactly what the guitar is playing, automatically the bass went down in the mix. If you notice those older bands like Accept, the bass is doing something that's a little bit different from the guitar. It's more with the kick drum instead of playing the riff the guitar is doing. In thrash metal and then death metal, the bass player always wound up playing what the guitar player was doing most of the time. It's been a decade long fight for us to be heard in the mix.\"\"I'd like to do some instructional material, but I'm still not sure if I'll try and do a DVD or book though. It will probably be easier to do a DVD, actually. Hopefully I'll be able to come up with some stuff that's worth releasing. I definitely won't put anything out until I'm sure it's of really high quality, and full of lots of good information. Also, you might have heard about the possibility of us doing a tab book. Well, we still haven't found a publisher for that.\"\"I practice the most when I have something I'm working on that's difficult, like one of Pat's songs for example. I usually won't practice for more than 3 or 4 hours a day unless I'm really inspired, or I have some kind of deadline.\"\n\nBesides playing bass, Alex has also contributed to lyric and music writing on many occasions for the band, some examples being \"Fucked with a Knife,\" \"Puncture Wound Massacre,\" \"I Will Kill You,\" \"Devoured by Vermin,\" \"Unleashing the Bloodthirsty,\" \"Scavenger consuming death,\" \"Scourge of iron\" and \"Murder Worship\".\nWebster is also known for his bass guitar solos/fills in such songs as \"Addicted to Vaginal Skin\", \"Mangled\", \"The Undead Will Feast\", \"Crushing the Despised\", \"Fucked with a Knife\", \"Hammer Smashed Face\", \"The Discipline of Revenge\", \"Put Them To Death\", \"She Was Asking For It\", \"Staring Through The Eyes of the Dead\", \"Bloodlands\", \"They Deserve to Die\", \"Rabid\", and \"The Strangulation Chair\".\nFrom 2013 to 2015 Webster wrote a monthly tuition column for the UK's Bass Guitar Magazine.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Andy Gill writes, \"Musically, the songs were completely at odds with what was going on in the rest of the pop world, which during the long, hot summer of 1967 was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of 'psychedelic' music\u2014mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos.\" Patrick Humphries itemizes the ways in which Dylan's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture: \"While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders, Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity. While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While Mick Jagger was 2,000 light years from home, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots.\"This aspect of the basement recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound came as a shock to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, \"Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [Dylan] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar.\" Dylan summed up the gap: \"At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads.\"When the Band began work on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they employed a recording technique similar to the one they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, \"We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique.\" That technique influenced groups including the Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record \"in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that the Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes\".\"Listening to The Basement Tapes now, it seems to be the beginning of what is called Americana or alt.country,\" wrote Billy Bragg. \"The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless\u2014and the best Americana does that as well.\" The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, \"If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts\u2014Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, the Waterboys\u2014have since tried to get back to that place.\"For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes \"sound like they were made in a cardboard box. I think [Dylan] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone. As if they sound like real folk songs\u2014because if you go back into the folk tradition, you will find songs as dark and as deep as these.\"In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked The Basement Tapes number 291 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, number 292 in a 2012 revised list, and number 335 in the magazine's 2020 list. In a special issue devoted to Dylan's work, Q magazine awarded the record five stars, its highest rating, commenting that \"Dylan's work is by turns haunting, hilarious and puzzling\u2014and all of it taps into centuries of American song\".Hip hop group Public Enemy referenced the album in their 2007 Dylan tribute song \"Long and Whining Road\": \"From basement tapes, beyond them dollars and cents / Changing of the guards spent, now where the hell the majors went?\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The recording sessions also became known as a stepping stone in Davis' move from bebop to modal jazz. The live side in particular was seen by critics as a glimpse at the sextet that would record Kind of Blue. The complementary and seemingly spontaneous style of performance ethic and the relationship between Davis and his musicians was fundamental for his work during these sessions and improved onto the Kind of Blue sessions.\nJazz historian and journalist Ira Gitler has considered 1958 Miles to be one of Davis' best works, while also noting that he was \"very taken with the performances\", alluding to the album's recordings after Gitler had listened to them. In the 1979 LP reissue liner notes, Gitler wrote \"These prime cuts of the Miles Davis Sextet, representative of what this most influential leader and his trendsetting band of that time, were doing in that particular portion of 1958, are a most welcome addition to the collectors library.\" The live portion of the album recorded at The Plaza Hotel was noted by critics as an early stage of the new sextet. Music writer Nicholas Taylor later wrote of the Plaza set:\n\nAn interesting and puzzling period piece, documenting the sextet exploring a sound that would soon morph into the rich tapestry of their 1959 masterpiece ... It is the snapshot\u2014albeit a blurred one\u2014of a group of musicians on the verge of greatness, beginning to feel each other\u2019s tics and idiosyncrasies, forming the bonds of a sextet that would soon alter the history of jazz forever.\nPrior to the live session, Miles Davis had already established a reputation as one of the jazz era's top live performers, following well-received performances at such venues as Birdland, also known as \"The Jazz Corner of the World\", in New York and the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island during the mid-1950s. The set at the Plaza Hotel further expanded Davis' repertoire in concert venues and increased his popularity among jazz fans and writers. Even though Milestones was Davis' first use of modes and Cannonball Adderley's presence helped make the band became a more powerful sextet, these sessions helped introduce Bill Evans to the music of Miles Davis. The May 26 session, in particular, exposed Evans to Davis' spontaneous ability in the studio to simplify complicated musical structures. In a 1979 interview for the jazz radio station WKCR, Evans remarked on his recording experience with Davis, stating \"Miles occasionally might say, 'Right here, I want this sound', and it turn out be a very key thing that changes the whole character of the [song]. For instance, on 'On Green Dolphin Street', the original changes of the chorus aren't the way [we recorded it]: the vamp changes being a major seventh up a minor third, down a half tone. That was [one when] he leaned over and said, 'I want this here.'\" Evans' influence would be apparent on the Kind of Blue sessions as it was during the initial 1958 sessions. All recorded studio work by Davis from 1958 for Columbia was later reissued on the box set compilation The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane. Following the implementation of his first modal compositions with the title track of Milestones and his first sessions with Bill Evans, the 1958 Sessions, Davis became satisfied with the results. This led to his preparation of an entire album based on modality, his 1959 masterwork, Kind of Blue.", "hasanswer": false}]}

By chance, he saw the scene before Tetsur\u014d Hoshino's departure in Adieu Galaxy Express 999 where a group of nameless soldiers take him on the 999 and send him on his way, and was impressed by it. This sparked his interest in voice acting, and since then it has been his policy to aim for \"three-dimensional acting.\" After graduating from high school, he entered a training school. In 1988, he made his voice acting debut in Wowser, and in 1989, he played his first regular character as Gai, the King Yaksha in Legend of Heavenly Sphere Shurato. Although he was a regular character in the series, he was in the position of a villain whose inner workings were rarely discussed in the story, so it was difficult for Koyasu to grasp the role and he had to do several dozen retakes for a single line. He later said that although his name recognition as a voice actor had increased, he did not feel like he was doing his best.\nAfterwards, Koyasu played the role of Minos in the OVA Aries released in 1990. The OVA was based on a fantasy manga of the same name that was being serialized at the time, and the voice actors for the main characters were to be decided by a magazine reader's vote. Since Koyasu had appeared in Shurato shortly before this, he had some recognition among the viewers, and he received the most votes for the role of Hades, the main character. However, at the time, Koyasu was still an unknown name in the voice acting industry, and the production members voiced their concerns about giving the lead role to a newcomer like Koyasu. As a result, the results of the readers' poll were rejected, and Koyasu was given the role of Hades' subordinate Minos, a role with little screentime.In Tekkaman Blade, Koyasu played the main character's rival, Tekkaman Evil (Shinya Aiba). Koyasu himself has often said in interviews that this is his favorite character, and after a period of sluggish performance, he put his voice acting career on the line to play the role, which ultimately led to his recovery. He also said that when he was playing the character, he thought he was really great, but when he watched the footage again later in life, he thought he was terrible at it, which led him to believe he was making progress.In the late 1990s, Koyasu worked on conceptualizing for the media franchise Wei\u00df Kreuz. He also formed the voice acting unit \"Wei\u00df\" consisting of voice castmates Shin-ichiro Miki, Tomokazu Seki and Hiro Y\u016bki, and became the first male voice actor to appear on the cover of a voice acting magazine and the first voice actor to make a music clip. In 2000\u20132001, he was active in music under the name ZAZEL.After working as a member of Production Baobab (1988\u20131998), Koyasu established his own representative office, T's Factory, in 1998. On May 5, 2020, on the occasion of his birthday, the official website and Twitter account of T's Factory were opened, and his profile was also released at the same time.\nIn 2020, Koyasu made his first appearance with his son, voice actor K\u014dki Koyasu, in an advertisement for Duel Masters. In April, he and K\u014dki teamed up for their own radio show, \"Takehito & K\u014dki's KOYASU RADIO.\"In 2021, he won the Best Actor in Supporting Role award at the 15th Seiyu Awards.Koyasu's name \"Takehito\" comes from the fact that his birthday is on Children's Day.

Dowding is best known for his work on \"power\", applying insights from formal analysis to central debates on the nature of power and structure of power in society. Expanding on Brian Barry's concept of \"luck\" (getting what you want without trying) he argues that some groups of people are \"systematically lucky\" in that they are advantaged because of the way society is structured. Such people are not powerful in the sense they have resources that they could use that other groups do not (though they might have this power as well) but rather systematically lucky in that they tend to get what they want without having to do anything. Alternatively, other groups are systematically unlucky. This argument has caused great controversy with critics including Brian Barry, Steven Lukes, Peter Morriss and more recently Andrew Hindmoor.Dowding has also worked on the Tiebout model of individuals moving location to get the local services they require, showing that such moving does occur in the UK though only to a small extent, and that people tend to move to areas for service reasons, but do not decide to leave from areas for those reasons. He has extended this work into examining Albert Hirschman's Exit, Voice and Loyalty Model and has a forthcoming Cambridge University Press book Exits, Voices and Social Investment co-authored with long-time collaborator Peter John extending and applying Hirschman's model to citizen satisfaction with government services.\nDowding also considered the theory of presidentialisation of British politics in his 2012 article, \u201cThe Prime Ministerialization of the British Prime Minister\u201d.

While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While Mick Jagger was 2,000 light years from home, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots.\"This aspect of the basement recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound came as a shock to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, \"Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [Dylan] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar.\" Dylan summed up the gap: \"At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads.\"When the Band began work on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they employed a recording technique similar to the one they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, \"We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique.\" That technique influenced groups including the Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record \"in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that the Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes\".\"Listening to The Basement Tapes now, it seems to be the beginning of what is called Americana or alt.country,\" wrote Billy Bragg. \"The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless\u2014and the best Americana does that as well.\" The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, \"If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts\u2014Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, the Waterboys\u2014have since tried to get back to that place.\"For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes \"sound like they were made in a cardboard box. I think [Dylan] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone. As if they sound like real folk songs\u2014because if you go back into the folk tradition, you will find songs as dark and as deep as these.\"In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked The Basement Tapes number 291 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, number 292 in a 2012 revised list, and number 335 in the magazine's 2020 list. In a special issue devoted to Dylan's work, Q magazine awarded the record five stars, its highest rating, commenting that \"Dylan's work is by turns haunting, hilarious and puzzling\u2014and all of it taps into centuries of American song\".Hip hop group Public Enemy referenced the album in their 2007 Dylan tribute song \"Long and Whining Road\": \"From basement tapes, beyond them dollars and cents / Changing of the guards spent, now where the hell the majors went?\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He studied at the School of Applied Arts between 1947 and 1951, and he married Marie-Claude Charels in 1963. His work, which was strongly linked with the emergence of Pop Art, matured between 1964 and 1972. He based many of his paintings on images collected through Delpire, the publishing house where he worked as a librarian. His photorealistic reproductions of enlarged black-and-white photographs have affinities both with the images in family albums and with publicity photos. Despite the success of these works, Gasiorowski turned away from painting (but not drawing) after 1972. His work changed radically as he became more critical of the tradition of western painting and the structure of the art world, and he turned to photomontage to express his ideas in works such as The Horrors of War. To stage these photos, he created miniature battlefield sets using purchased and homemade toy planes, trains, tanks, and so on. He even costumed himself with a bloody head bandage to serve as one of the wounded. Gasiorowski himself later saw his obsession with this work as one reason that his wife left him in 1976.Another tack Gasiorowski took in his critical investigations was to begin creating fictive artworks such as Worosiskiga Academy, a fake art school run by a tyrant (the name is an anagram of his own last name) which produced a variety of artworks, from drawings and gouaches to objects. One such issue was a set of hats signed with the names of 500 famous artists, intended as a critique of the art market and of the compromises it forced on artists. The first exhibition of the Worosiskiga Academy project was at the Galerie Maeght in 1981; despite the dismal failure of this show, the gallery continue to support and exhibit works by Gasiorowski. The Museum of Modern Art, Paris held a retrospective of his work in 1983.\nGasiorowski's fictions succeeded in confusing visitors to his exhibitions. It was difficult for audiences of the time to know what to make of\u2014for example\u2014an imaginary artist named Kiga, a member of the 'Worosis' tribe, who was the embodiment of 'primitive' painting and who mixed her paints from excrement and aromatic plants to make paintings in the style of C\u00e9zanne. Gasiorowski's fictive productions took a wide range of forms: paintings, drawings, painted objects, organic sculptures.\nAfter 1983, Gasiorowski finally returned to painting and developed several bodies of work, often at monumental scale, in which the groups of paintings were understood to form a single larger work. His final work was a 12-panel polyptych, Fertility.\nHe died suddenly of a heart attack on August 19, 1986, in Lyon, and is buried there in Saint-Julien-du-Sault cemetery.\nHis work is included in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to a contemporary review from the Los Angeles Times, the band attracted \"a cream crop of Sunset Strip celebrities who came to judge the change.\" The shows were, in Spevack's words, \"remarkably successful by all accounts\", and received rave reviews from the local press. Digby Diehl of the Times referred to the band's sound as \"a hypnotic m\u00e9lange\" and further wrote that: \"The flute and harpsichord jazz improvisations on numbers such as 'Stephanie Knows Who' and 'Orange Skies' lend a fresh lift to what might be an ordinary rock piece.\" A later review from the paper placed the band's \"clean\" presentation and \"balance of instruments and roles\" with those of the Beatles and Buffalo Springfield. Echols remembered the band's performances with the expanded lineup as \"probably the most fun we had playing.\"Da Capo was first announced as an album on November 12, 1966, with an advertisement placed by Elektra on page 1 of Billboard magazine. By late January 1967 when Da Capo was listed by Billboard as a \"New Action Album\", \"7 and 7 Is\" had already received commercial and critical success, helping to boost the album's sales. It entered the Billboard Top LPs chart on February 11, 1967, and peaked at number 80 on April 8, failing to achieve the commercial success the band had hoped it would. Lee blamed the album's disappointing performance on Elektra, but Botnick disagreed, saying, \"Arthur wouldn't go out and promote it!\" Stuart later reflected that the band \"should have toured behind it\"; however, he recognized that Lee \"prided himself on being different. If bands toured after releasing an album, he would do it differently.\" Regarding the album as \"an undeniably groundbreaking release for 1966\" with a style that had \"no other context or reference in [rock] up to that point\", Einarson asks if Lee had \"overestimated his own audience with a body of music perhaps too complex and esoteric for their tastes\". In the observation of writer Jim Bickhart, \"by that point, Arthur had shown he was kind of oblivious to who his audience was and how to appeal to them ... he was not thinking, 'I'm going to bring my audience along with me,' he was just thinking, 'I'm going to do what I'm going to do.'\"Da Capo received favorable recognition from contemporary reviewers. David Harris of Mojo-Navigator called it \"a great advance\" over Love's debut album and recognized their \"integration of jazz and [rock] into a new form of music.\" In a more critical review for Esquire magazine, Robert Christgau felt that, although \"7 and 7 Is\" was a \"perfect rocker\", the rest of side one \"sounds cluttered and lacks sock\", directing the latter criticism to Lee's voice being \"more often too sweet for his material.\" Of \"Revelation\", Christgau wrote: \"It includes excellent guitar and harmonica work and great screaming ... It also includes some mediocre alto sax and (I shudder) a protracted drum solo.

The recording sessions also became known as a stepping stone in Davis' move from bebop to modal jazz. The live side in particular was seen by critics as a glimpse at the sextet that would record Kind of Blue. The complementary and seemingly spontaneous style of performance ethic and the relationship between Davis and his musicians was fundamental for his work during these sessions and improved onto the Kind of Blue sessions.\nJazz historian and journalist Ira Gitler has considered 1958 Miles to be one of Davis' best works, while also noting that he was \"very taken with the performances\", alluding to the album's recordings after Gitler had listened to them. In the 1979 LP reissue liner notes, Gitler wrote \"These prime cuts of the Miles Davis Sextet, representative of what this most influential leader and his trendsetting band of that time, were doing in that particular portion of 1958, are a most welcome addition to the collectors library.\" The live portion of the album recorded at The Plaza Hotel was noted by critics as an early stage of the new sextet. Music writer Nicholas Taylor later wrote of the Plaza set:\n\nAn interesting and puzzling period piece, documenting the sextet exploring a sound that would soon morph into the rich tapestry of their 1959 masterpiece ... It is the snapshot\u2014albeit a blurred one\u2014of a group of musicians on the verge of greatness, beginning to feel each other\u2019s tics and idiosyncrasies, forming the bonds of a sextet that would soon alter the history of jazz forever.\nPrior to the live session, Miles Davis had already established a reputation as one of the jazz era's top live performers, following well-received performances at such venues as Birdland, also known as \"The Jazz Corner of the World\", in New York and the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island during the mid-1950s. The set at the Plaza Hotel further expanded Davis' repertoire in concert venues and increased his popularity among jazz fans and writers. Even though Milestones was Davis' first use of modes and Cannonball Adderley's presence helped make the band became a more powerful sextet, these sessions helped introduce Bill Evans to the music of Miles Davis. The May 26 session, in particular, exposed Evans to Davis' spontaneous ability in the studio to simplify complicated musical structures. In a 1979 interview for the jazz radio station WKCR, Evans remarked on his recording experience with Davis, stating \"Miles occasionally might say, 'Right here, I want this sound', and it turn out be a very key thing that changes the whole character of the [song]. For instance, on 'On Green Dolphin Street', the original changes of the chorus aren't the way [we recorded it]: the vamp changes being a major seventh up a minor third, down a half tone. That was [one when] he leaned over and said, 'I want this here.'\" Evans' influence would be apparent on the Kind of Blue sessions as it was during the initial 1958 sessions. All recorded studio work by Davis from 1958 for Columbia was later reissued on the box set compilation The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane. Following the implementation of his first modal compositions with the title track of Milestones and his first sessions with Bill Evans, the 1958 Sessions, Davis became satisfied with the results. This led to his preparation of an entire album based on modality, his 1959 masterwork, Kind of Blue.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is found wandering Saddleworth Moor, and he claims to be the second coming of Jesus. At first he is met with scepticism, and is even locked up. One of the few people who believes him is a young Catholic priest, who mentions an obscure Christian text that mentions that the lamb will be sent to the city of the North, followed by a series of numbers that turned out to be map co-ordinates. The recent death of the Pope is also seen as a sign. Steve escapes and decides to indicate he is really the son of God to humanity by turning night into day over the football stadium at Maine Road, advertising the feat on the internet and attracting the attention of the world's media. Steve then announces he must find the third testament within five days. He states that humanity needs to start taking responsibility for their actions, and that everyone, regardless of their religion or origin, needs to begin again and forget past conflicts. He also says that Christians should not boast about being right, then reveals that currently heaven is empty, while hell is bursting at the seams. There is much hysteria and panic; particularly when Satan and several demons possess people (only indicated by silver eyes) to cause trouble. Satan takes possession of a man named Johnny Tyler that Judy met through a dating agency. He eventually reveals to Judy he wants Steve to fail and fall into despair, so that after Armageddon God will judge Steve's actions as a human and send him to hell, and they can rule together. In a deleted scene, it is revealed Satan also wants God to return to being the merciless, angry God of the Old Testament.\nLater, it is revealed that Steve's earthly father could not have fathered him as he was born sterile, another indicator that Steve is really the son of God.\nThere is also media frenzy surrounding the events, especially after a tape is leaked of Steve saying that the world will end if the testament is not found, and he is taken into police protection. Some of Steve's friends accept him as the Messiah - Pete (who kept his Christianity hidden, not knowing how his friends would react) and Fiona (who becomes crazed, as this is the first time she has ever believed). Judy, an atheist, remains sceptical. She and Steve have some heated arguments (at one point, in a fit of anger, Steve is tempted to use his godly powers to kill her), especially as despite being the son of God, Steve is neither omniscient (relying on information \"downloading\" into his head, which frustrates him too) nor omnipotent (he cannot heal the sick). Steve later says that he does have powers, but he refuses to use them as he could get power mad, and reiterates it is up to humanity to sort themselves out this time. Judy is also confronted by several demons and manipulated into situations to get her to believe, which is part of Satan's plan to have Steve fall into despair.\nDuring the next few days, Steve miraculously survives several attempts made on his life, including a bomb going off in a pub in which he is drinking. The devil and his demons also attempt to turn his father Frank against him, getting him hooked on drugs and alcohol and convincing him that he is now a joke in the public's eyes (one deleted scene saw him watching Bernard Manning on TV making jokes at his expense). Frank tries to shoot Steve, but ends up killing Pete. After her husband leaves her, Fiona attempts suicide and tries to kill her children too. Also during this time Judy and Steve's relationship grows deeper, and they have sex.\nSteve himself has no idea what the third testament will be; he receives too many candidates to figure out which one is the real one. The Chief Superintendent of the police, who is also possessed by a demon, has them thrown out, saying that even if it were there, Steve would not be able to make his broadcast to the world. Having failed to discover the Testament, the people of the world hide in their homes, fearing the world's end.\nSteve then visits Judy in hope of trying to work out what the testament is, and Judy reveals to him that it is the record she is making of events. Judy, who is filmed night and day by cameras from the world's media around her house, makes spaghetti and laces it with rat poison, but announces this to Steve before presenting it to him. She states that it is Judgement Day, but for Steve and God, stating that it has been the existence of God or the argument about it which has led humanity to do so many bad things to one another. Steve is persuaded by Judy that he must die, and moreover make it permanent (in the sense of ceasing to exist rather than returning to heaven), so that humanity fights for itself rather than relying on the evils of fundamentalism. This will not only be the death of him, but of God, Satan, heaven and hell - the end of all religion. She also says that the absence of any kind of afterlife may scare people into living their lives properly.\nSteve does not believe her at first, thinking she was influenced by the demons. He does one last divine \"download\" and, to his horror, realises that this is indeed the Third Testament, \"the closing of the family business.\" He is scared at first, but then decides that it is time to die, and he eats his Last Supper. Henceforth, the world goes back to normal, with a few people referring to Judy as \"the woman who killed God\", but she otherwise goes back to living an ordinary insignificant life, having married the policeman who guarded her despite everyone else leaving their jobs and posts in fear of the apparent apocalypse. Judy sees Johnny Tyler (who has no memory of being possessed) and asks him if she did the right thing, but he cannot answer \u2013 suggesting that the audience needs to decide for itself.\nAn earlier draft of the script features a twist ending in which Judy is married to Steve, who has simply given up his divinity and become human again, with only her recognising him. However, Davies was advised against ending the story this way by his friend and fellow writer Paul Abbott, who felt that it cheated the audience.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Andy Gill writes, \"Musically, the songs were completely at odds with what was going on in the rest of the pop world, which during the long, hot summer of 1967 was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of 'psychedelic' music\u2014mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos.\" Patrick Humphries itemizes the ways in which Dylan's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture: \"While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders, Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity. While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While Mick Jagger was 2,000 light years from home, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots.\"This aspect of the basement recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound came as a shock to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, \"Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [Dylan] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar.\" Dylan summed up the gap: \"At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads.\"When the Band began work on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they employed a recording technique similar to the one they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, \"We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique.\" That technique influenced groups including the Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record \"in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that the Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes\".\"Listening to The Basement Tapes now, it seems to be the beginning of what is called Americana or alt.country,\" wrote Billy Bragg. \"The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless\u2014and the best Americana does that as well.\" The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, \"If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts\u2014Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, the Waterboys\u2014have since tried to get back to that place.\"For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes \"sound like they were made in a cardboard box. I think [Dylan] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone. As if they sound like real folk songs\u2014because if you go back into the folk tradition, you will find songs as dark and as deep as these.\"In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked The Basement Tapes number 291 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, number 292 in a 2012 revised list, and number 335 in the magazine's 2020 list. In a special issue devoted to Dylan's work, Q magazine awarded the record five stars, its highest rating, commenting that \"Dylan's work is by turns haunting, hilarious and puzzling\u2014and all of it taps into centuries of American song\".Hip hop group Public Enemy referenced the album in their 2007 Dylan tribute song \"Long and Whining Road\": \"From basement tapes, beyond them dollars and cents / Changing of the guards spent, now where the hell the majors went?\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1935 he founded the Saxl Instrument Company, which designed and manufactured tension meters for use in the textile industry, and later in other industries.  The company, which Saxl ran jointly with his wife, Lucretia Hildreth Saxl, from their home in Harvard, Massachusetts, was renamed Tensitron in 1953.  Saxl is reported as having stated that he worked under Albert Einstein.  He died in 1981.Saxl is most well known for a series of controversial experiments in which he measured unexpected changes in the period of a torsion pendulum under various conditions.  In one series of experiments, the period of a torsion pendulum situated inside a Faraday cage, with the pendulum and the cage connected by a conducting path, was observed to increase as the voltage on the cage was increased.  In another experiment, the period of the pendulum was seen to increase during an eclipse.  Saxl is reported to have attempted, without success, to get this work published in the Physical Review; eventually the work was published in Nature.In the early 1960s, Saxl began a collaboration with Mildred Allen of Mount Holyoke College.  In 1971,  Saxl and Allen published a report of  anomalous changes in the period of a torsion pendulum during a solar eclipse in 1970 and hypothesized that \u201cgravitational theory needs to be modified\u201d.  In addition, they observed unexplained diurnal variation in the period of the pendulum.  None of the effects observed by Saxl and Allen have obvious explanations in terms of well-established theories of gravity and electromagnetism.  Although more subtle explanations, still using conventional physical theory, have been proffered there does not appear to be general agreement as to the cause of the anomalies.  Saxl and Allen's claim that general relativity must be modified, and earlier claims of a similar nature by Allais based on observations of anomalies in the behaviour of a paraconical pendulum, have not won acceptance by the physics community, and recent attempts to reproduce the phenomena have not been successful.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Her image famously appears in Novalis\u2019 Hymns to the Night, a foundational text of the literary movement known as German Romanticism.\nAlthough Novalis's love for Sophie has assumed mythic proportions, their time together was short and uneventful. The two met on 17 November 1794 when Novalis was twenty-two and Sophie was only twelve. They became engaged on Sophie's thirteenth birthday 17 March 1795. Sophie became sick in November 1795, and her sickness continued until her death at the age of 15 in March 1797.

The recording sessions also became known as a stepping stone in Davis' move from bebop to modal jazz. The live side in particular was seen by critics as a glimpse at the sextet that would record Kind of Blue. The complementary and seemingly spontaneous style of performance ethic and the relationship between Davis and his musicians was fundamental for his work during these sessions and improved onto the Kind of Blue sessions.\nJazz historian and journalist Ira Gitler has considered 1958 Miles to be one of Davis' best works, while also noting that he was \"very taken with the performances\", alluding to the album's recordings after Gitler had listened to them. In the 1979 LP reissue liner notes, Gitler wrote \"These prime cuts of the Miles Davis Sextet, representative of what this most influential leader and his trendsetting band of that time, were doing in that particular portion of 1958, are a most welcome addition to the collectors library.\" The live portion of the album recorded at The Plaza Hotel was noted by critics as an early stage of the new sextet. Music writer Nicholas Taylor later wrote of the Plaza set:\n\nAn interesting and puzzling period piece, documenting the sextet exploring a sound that would soon morph into the rich tapestry of their 1959 masterpiece ... It is the snapshot\u2014albeit a blurred one\u2014of a group of musicians on the verge of greatness, beginning to feel each other\u2019s tics and idiosyncrasies, forming the bonds of a sextet that would soon alter the history of jazz forever.\nPrior to the live session, Miles Davis had already established a reputation as one of the jazz era's top live performers, following well-received performances at such venues as Birdland, also known as \"The Jazz Corner of the World\", in New York and the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island during the mid-1950s. The set at the Plaza Hotel further expanded Davis' repertoire in concert venues and increased his popularity among jazz fans and writers. Even though Milestones was Davis' first use of modes and Cannonball Adderley's presence helped make the band became a more powerful sextet, these sessions helped introduce Bill Evans to the music of Miles Davis. The May 26 session, in particular, exposed Evans to Davis' spontaneous ability in the studio to simplify complicated musical structures. In a 1979 interview for the jazz radio station WKCR, Evans remarked on his recording experience with Davis, stating \"Miles occasionally might say, 'Right here, I want this sound', and it turn out be a very key thing that changes the whole character of the [song]. For instance, on 'On Green Dolphin Street', the original changes of the chorus aren't the way [we recorded it]: the vamp changes being a major seventh up a minor third, down a half tone. That was [one when] he leaned over and said, 'I want this here.'\" Evans' influence would be apparent on the Kind of Blue sessions as it was during the initial 1958 sessions. All recorded studio work by Davis from 1958 for Columbia was later reissued on the box set compilation The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane. Following the implementation of his first modal compositions with the title track of Milestones and his first sessions with Bill Evans, the 1958 Sessions, Davis became satisfied with the results. This led to his preparation of an entire album based on modality, his 1959 masterwork, Kind of Blue.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Basic English is an auxiliary international language of 850 words comprising a system that covers everything necessary for day-to-day purposes. These 850 words, together with its five combinatory rules, were designed to do the work of some 20,000 English words, which appealed to many of the leading communications philosophers and theorists of the time, including Otto Neurath and Willard C. Brinton. To promote Basic English, Ogden in 1927 founded the Orthological Institute, from orthology, the abstract term he proposed for its work (see orthoepeia). Its headquarters were on King's Parade in Cambridge. From 1928 to 1930 Ogden set out his developing ideas on Basic English and Jeremy Bentham in Psyche.In 1929 the Orthological Institute published a recording by James Joyce of a passage from a draft of Finnegans Wake. In summer of that year Tales Told of Shem and Shaun had been published, an extract from the work as it then stood, and Ogden had been asked to supply an introduction. When Joyce was in London in August, Ogden approached him to do a reading for a recording. In 1932 Ogden published a translation of the Finnegans Wake passage into Basic English.By 1943 the Institute had moved to Gordon Square in London.Ogden was also a consultant with the International Auxiliary Language Association, which presented Interlingua in 1951.

Even as a fresco painter his manipulative power was not great. In critically examining the execution in colour of some of his magnificent designs, one cannot help feeling that he was, in this respect, unable to do them full justice. Cornelius and his associates endeavoured to follow in their works the spirit of the Italian painters. But the Italian strain is to a considerable extent modified by the D\u00fcrer heritage. This D\u00fcrer influence is manifest in a tendency to overcrowding in composition, in a degree of attenuation in the proportions of, and a\npoverty of contour in, the nude figure, and also in a leaning to the selection of Gothic forms for draperies. These peculiarities are even noticeable in Cornelius's principal work of the \"Last Judgment\", in the Ludwigskirche in Munich.The attenuation and want of flexibility of contour in the nude are perhaps most conspicuous in his frescoes of classical subjects in the Glyptothek, especially in that representing the contention for the body of Patroclus. But despite these peculiarities there is always in his works a grandeur and nobility of conception. Although not dexterous in the handling of the brush, he could conceive and design a subject with masterly purpose. If he had an imperfect eye for colour, he had vast mental foresight in directing the German school of painting; and his favorite motto of \"Deutschland uber alles\" indicates the direction and the strength of his patriotism. His pupils included Karl Hermann, Wilhelm von Kaulbach and Adam Eberle. Cornelius often relied on pupils and assistants for the execution, and sometimes even the design of the projects of which he was in charge. The cartoons for the Glyptothek were all by Cornelius's own hand; in the Pinakothek, however, his sketches and small drawings sufficed, and at the Ludwigskirche even the invention of some of the subjects was entrusted to Hermann.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She was educated in Montreal, Quebec. She started a career in journalism at a radio station in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res in 1954. She held various jobs, including editor of the weekly Frontier Rouyn-Noranda, host of the show La Femme dans le monde (The Woman in the World) at CKRN and secretary and public relations officer for the United Steelworkers of America. While living in Paris she wrote for Petit Journal at the Patrie, for New Journal, and for Ch\u00e2telaine magazine. \nPayette returned to Montreal where she worked on the television program Interdit aux hommes (\"prohibited to men\") for Radio-Canada. From 1965 to 1972, Payette worked on a series of animated television programs for the French and English networks of the CBC. From 1972-75, Payette was the host of the TV series Appelez moi Lise\" (Call Me Lise) and Lise Lib. Payette was appointed President of the Quebec National Holidays Committee in 1975.Payette held several portfolios in the Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque government. She was Minister for Consumer Affairs, Cooperatives and Financial Institutions, the  Minister of State for the Status of Women, and the Minister of State for Social Development. The phrase \"Je me souviens\" (\"I remember\") on Quebec vehicle license plates is attributed to Payette, replacing the old slogan of \"La Belle Province\". Payette was also instrumental in the founding of the SAAQ automobile insurance company of Quebec, and the updating of the Civil Code of Quebec, allowing two surnames for children.\nDuring the campaign for the 1980 Quebec referendum Payette denounced women supporters of the \"No\" side as Yvettes (the name of a docile young girl in an old school textbook). She went so far as calling Claude Ryan's wife, Madeleine Guay, an \"Yvette\". This backfired spectacularly as \"the Yvettes\", led by Guay, held a number of political rallies in response to her remarks.  As Donald Brittain put it in his documentary series of Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and Pierre Elliott Trudeau, The Champions, \"The old women were proud to be 'Yvettes'. The young women resented being 'Yvettes'.  Payette had galvanized them into a fighting force\". The first of those rallies happened on March 30 when a group of 1,700 women held the brunch des Yvettes at the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac in Quebec City. A major rally occurred at the Montreal Forum on April 7 when 14,000 women denounced the minister's declarations about women and manifested their support for the \"No\" side. This was the first major rally for the \"No\" side in the campaign. This would be followed by many more rallies, particularly by women groups. Lise Payette would eventually apologize for her remarks.\nIn 1981, Payette left political life and did not stand for re-election. She became a writer for television with a series of successful soap operas. She founded the television production company Focus, with whom she first conceived the documentary series \"Les quatre chevaliers de l'apocalypse\" and \"Femmes\" and other fiction series, as a producer or author.\nIn 2004, Payette began writing columns for the Journal de Montreal. In 2007, she switched to Le Devoir. Payette continued to write for the paper until May 6, 2016, when she signed off with the phrase \"Le Devoir ends the chronicle of Lise Payette,\" without further explanation, although she has since claimed that editor Brian Myles let her go without explanation from one day to the next.In 2007, Payette wrote a song for Celine Dion entitled \"Je cherche l'ombre\" which is included on Dion's D'Elles album.\nIn 1994, Payette was recognized as \"Woman of the Year\" by Canadian Women in Communications. Payette was awarded the Florence Bird Award by the International Centre for Human Rights and Development in 1997. She was awarded the Grand Prize of the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television, September 27, 1998. \nIn 2000, Payette was awarded the gold medal of the Mouvement national des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, September 30, 2000. In 2001, she was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec. In 2003, she received a lifetime achievement award from the Quebec Business Women's Network. In June 2009, she received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Quebec in Montreal. Payette was awarded the Pierre-Vadebonc\u0153ur Prize in 2012 and the Guy-Price Mauffette Prize in 2014. Payette died at her home on September 5, 2018.Payette defended former PQ premier Pauline Marois's failed legislation known as the Charter of Quebec Values, which would prohibit public servants from wearing religious garb at work.  The proposal, seen to target Muslim women, was widely criticized even by some Quebec nationalists.Her daughter, Dominique Payette, ran unsuccessfully for the PQ in the riding of Charlesbourg in the 2014 election.\nPayette in 2016 defended her friend, the deceased film director Claude Jutra, about allegations that he sexually abused children that were revealed after his death.In 2017, Payette tried to dissuade Quebec media personality L\u00e9a Clermont-Dion from proceeding with a complaint of sexual assault alleged against journalist Michel Venne.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "106_790", "question": "What kind of work does Dele Giwa do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_38664", "text": "On 20 October, the day after the bombing, the government convened a press conference presided over by Augustus Aikhomu. Before the press conference started, all press photographers, foreign journalists, and Nigerians that worked for foreign news media were ordered out. Those left behind were told that the briefing was \"off the record\" and Aikhomu would not be entertaining any questions.Aikhomu then went on to ask Ismaila Gwarzo, the Director of the SSS and Haliru Akilu to render their accounts of what had transpired between Dele Giwa and their agencies in the recent past. Gwarzo confirmed that the SSS had invited Giwa for questioning over allegations of gun running. Akilu on his part confirmed that he had called Giwa's home on 18 October to ask for directions to the house so he could stop over to see Giwa while on his way to Kano through Ikeja airport. Akilu also said that he had wanted to visit Giwa at home to \"prove a Hausa adage that if you visit someone in his house, you show him you are really a friend.\" Ekpu claimed that he remembered Gwarzo saying that the killing was \"quite embarrassing\" and also that Tony Momoh had described it as \"a clear case of assassination\"; later he was quoted saying, \"a special probe would serve no useful purpose\".\nGraffiti of the time implied a belief that the SSS had been responsible.In a newspaper interview years later in retirement, Chris Omeben who at the time was the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of the Federal Investigation and Intelligence Bureau (FIIB) at Alagbon, on his part recalled that he was the second officer to have handled the case file after he had taken it over from his predecessor at the FIIB, Victor Pam. Omeben explained that he had done what any competent investigator would have done in unraveling the circumstances surrounding the death of Dele Giwa. He went on to say that he had examined the crime scene and found it suspicious that the toilet adjacent to the blast site which Kayode Soyinka alleged he was occupying when the explosion occurred had also suffered damage from the blast but Soyinka was left unscathed. Omeben described the force of the explosion to have been strong enough to blow out the steel bars over the toilet window (burglary protection), which in his own assessment made Soyinka's story less convincing. Omeben also claims he requested to interview Dan Agbese, Ray Ekpu and Kayode Soyinka. Of the three, only Agbese turned up, he was later to find out that Soyinka had fled the country. Omeben also recalled that in the course of his investigations he had cause to interrogate both Haliru Akilu and Tunde Togun. According to Omeben Akilu defended Giwa's invitation to the DMI by saying Giwa was invited to clarify statements he made  to a New York daily which had been assessed as having potential to paint the country in a bad light in the international press. The only known interview Giwa gave to any New York daily was one published eight months earlier in a New York Times story about rising religious nationalism and extremism in Nigeria. On the issue of rising Islamic nationalism, Giwa gave this singular quote in the story, It's a dangerous, explosive trend,...in the worst case, I see a situation where die-hard Christians and die-hard Moslems are fighting in the streets. Omeben said he was satisfied with the reasons Akilu and Togun gave for inviting Giwa.However, Soyinka has come out to reply Omeben and accused him of spreading deliberate falsehood with his comments on him on his involvement with the parcel bomb incident. In an interview he granted The Nation newspaper of Lagos of Saturday, 19 January 2013, Soyinka denied that he ran to the toilet when the bomb exploded. He said he did not know where Omeben got that false information from. When questioned, Soyinka requested to not be required to relive the experience again.Omeben also alleged that he was being pressured into naming Babangida and Akilu as suspects when he yet had no evidence linking them to the crime. Some of this pressure led to the formation of a special squad to investigate the case, the squad was headed by Assistant Commissioner of Police Abubakar Tsav. Omeben alleges that the then Inspector General of Police Gambo Jimeta has asked him to leave the case with the Tsav team out of anger at how messy the whole situation was getting.Omeben also spoke about certain \"fixations\" in the minds of the general public about the case, in his own words \"...There is the tendency for people to make up their minds as to what they want to see or hear. It may not necessarily be the truth and once they are so fixated, every other thing that somebody else would say would not mean anything to them. Dele Giwa's case suffered such a fixation\".In testimony that he gave on 3 July 2001, before the Justice Oputa led Human Rights Violations Investigations Commission (HRVIC), Tsav alleged that the government stonewalled his investigation into the assassination. Tsav claimed that he was not granted permission to question key actors involved, including Tunde Togun, Ismaila Gwarzo and Haliru Akilu. He also said that he had requested that the privileges of these officers be withdrawn so he could take their statements and conduct a search of their offices and residences for items of evidential value but this request was denied. Tsav averred that in his final report, he had concluded that there was enough circumstantial evidence to accuse the duo of Togun and Akilu of conspiracy to murder but still the government did not make these two officers available for interrogation or a voice identification as he had requested.Tsav claims that he handed the case file back to Chris Omeben. Tsav alleged that none of his recommendations were implemented, the case file was never returned to him and that there was no evidence that the case was transferred to another officer or agency. Tsav said he believed Giwa was killed because he believed Giwa was in \"the way of some powerful forces\".After the investigation stalled, various conspiracy theories arose to explain why Giwa was killed. One of the most popular and still the most enduring has been the Gloria Okon connection. Gloria Okon was a Lady who was arrested in 1985 at the Aminu Kano International airport on suspicion of drug smuggling. Soon after, it was alleged that she had died in custody, the government subsequently constituted a commission of inquiry to investigate the matter.Conspiracy theorists allege that Gloria Okon was a drug mule working for the wife of General Ibrahim Babangida who was then the Minister of Defence in the regime of General Muhammadu Buhari. The theorists allege that during interrogation Okon had claimed that she worked for highly placed Nigerians, in particular Babangida's wife. The theory goes on that Babangida spirited Okon out of detention to the United Kingdom, sold the public the ruse of a dead Gloria Okon and that Dele Giwa happened upon Okon on a trip to the UK where she told him her story. The story goes on that armed with this information, Giwa tried to blackmail the now Military President, Ibrahim Babangida and this was why he was killed. This blackmail theory might not be unconnected with the off-the-record interview that Lt Col A.K Togun gave to airport correspondents of the Guardian on 27 October 1986. In the interview, when asked about Dele Giwa's killing and the suspicion in the public that he was killed by the government, Togun was quoted as saying \"...one person cannot come out to blackmail us. I am an expert in blackmail. I can blackmail very well. I studied propaganda so no one person can come and blackmail us after an agreement...\". Togun's statement was in the context of the secret agreement reached by Giwa and other media executives at the 9 October meeting, he seemed to accuse Giwa of reneging on the agreement leading to Giwa being invited for questioning on 16 October. Theorists also allege that Babangida's drug running activities were brought to the attention of the Buhari-Idiagbon regime which led the regime to slate him for retirement on 1 October 1985. They also say that it was his impending retirement that inspired him to plan the coup that toppled Buhari in August 1985.Giwa's colleagues at Newswatch have debunked this theory and deny any link between Giwa, Gloria Okon and Mrs. Babangida. In a Newswatch interview marking the 25th anniversary of the magazine, one of the founding partners of the organisation Yakubu Mohammed explained the Giwa-Newswatch-Gloria Okon link.\nMohammed claims that Dele Giwa had not been writing any Gloria Okon story and that the closest Newswatch got to a Gloria Okon story was at one of the magazine's editorial conferences where a Newswatch reporter, Bose lasaki, who was a niece to President Olusegun Obasanjo spoke about a \"rumour\" making the rounds to the effect that Gloria Okon had not died in detention but had been spirited out of the country. Mohammed claimed that Lasaki's story was dismissed off-hand but that she was asked to find out more about the rumour. Lasaki was alleged to have returned for the next editorial conference the following week and declared that there was no substance to the rumour. Mohammed alleged that Giwa was not at any of these meetings. The Ibrahim Babangida drug running angle was also called into question by revelations made by the embittered former head of the National Security Organization (NSO), Alhaji Mohammed Lawal Rafindadi. In 1985, following a request by the Supreme Military Council, the NSO under Rafindadi investigated Babangida and found him complicit of forgery and activities inimical to national security. This issue arose as a result of Babangida and his in-law, Mr Sunny Okogwu's interest in an arms manufacturing venture in Kaduna called Black Gold. The SMC, based on the NSO's findings slated Babangida for retirement.\nThe only witness to the events shortly before the bomb exploded, Mr Kayode Soyinka had alleged that the package had a label with the seal of the Nigerian President and also claimed that the label indicated that it was from the office of the president. However, no other witness has corroborated this claim, Giwa's 17-year-old son, Billy, who had delivered the package to Giwa has never corroborated this claim. Soyinka's testimony about the events prior to and after the bombing have also been brought into question, there have been accusations made to the effect that he might have been the same person that detonated the bomb by remote control as he was not injured in the explosion.Soyinka is also alleged to have given conflicting accounts of the events to the Police and media outlets, he is also accused of fleeing the country while investigations were ongoing. To the accusation of fleeing the country, Soyinka has this to say in that his interview with The Nation (Saturday, 19 January 2013): \"Dele was very close to his mother. He did not joke with her at all. It was an honour for me to have met her. The last time I saw her was at Dele's burial in their village near Auchi, in Edo State. I was there live with my wife contrary to the erroneous story of Babangida's government's mischief makers who tried to deceive the Nigerian people in order to exonerate the government from the assassination of Dele Giwa, saying that I had fled the country. They deliberately spread all kinds of falsehood, ignoring even newspaper reports and pictures of myself and my wife in attendance at the burial. And mind you, how could I have fled the country? My wife and children were not in Nigeria with me when the bomb exploded, they had to take the next available flight to Nigeria to join me. Yet, Babangida's men said I fled the country. And my family and I remained in the country throughout the whole period of the controversy and burial arrangement. We returned to London together through the former British Caledonian Airways, through Muritala Mohammed Airport. There was no way we could have left quietly. We were accompanied to and seen off at the airport by friends, including the Newswatch editors, and family. The airline people recognised us. Our two children were still small then. The air hostesses took them from us, played with them, and they were asking me if I was feeling better \u2013 knowing the trauma one must have been through in the past weeks, and took us straight and right inside the aircraft, even before checking in other passengers. Yet the Babangida men kept saying, even till today, that I fled the country. Can you imagine?\"Giwa's lawyer was also accused of prematurely accusing the government of Dele Giwa's murder thereby truncating the investigation into the case, Newswatch magazine in an edition of 18 November 1986, disowned Fawehimni.The subsequent court cases instituted by Fawehinmi against the government to enable him try the case as a private prosecutor after the Director of Public Prosecution, Mrs. Eniola Fadayomi had refused to prosecute based on the evidence available were mostly unsuccessful. An excerpt of the Judgement by the then Lagos State Chief Judge, Justice Candido Johnson reads thus \"...Even if one considers the reasonableness of time, I would say that the incident that gave birth to the death of the late Dele Giwa is not only unique in its form but also complex and would require sufficient time to conduct detailed and balanced investigation, a report on which the appropriate authority would reasonably act. The timing here appears hasty and premature. It appears impulsive without giving reasonable time and chance for a detailed and balanced investigation into this sordid incident.\nIn the circumstances and having regard to the review made above, it is my ruling that this (ex-parte) application is misconceived and it is therefore dismissed. Leave to apply for mandamus is hereby refused.\"Fawehinmi went on to the Supreme Court and got a favourable judgement which enabled him go back to the Lagos State High Court, this judgement also mandated the Justice Candido to recuse himself from the case and appoint another judge to hear the case. On 23 February 1988, Justice Longe ruled that the two security officers, Lt. Col Tunde Togun and Col. Haliru Akilu could not be tried for the murder of Dele Giwa. In his ruling Justice Longe averred among other things that,\"...the Attorney general did not oppose the objection raised by counsel to the 'accused' persons, Chief Rotimi Williams, on the ground that the information was filed by private prosecutor (Chief Gani Fawehinmi) when the information had not been completed and especially when the 'INFORMATION IMPLICATED ONE OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES'(Kayode Soyinka)...the proof of evidence before the Court was mere HEARSAY\u2026. Based on the evidence available before the court, it will be an abuse of the process of court to call the two security chiefs for trial. The information is therefore quashed accordingly.\" Kayode Soyinka was represented in court by Kayode Sofola SAN, representing the chambers of Kehinde Sofola SAN, that succeeded to getting the court to rule as frivolous the reference to Soyinka being \"implicated\". The court also ordered that cost be paid Soyinka by the 'accused' persons.In 2001, General Ibrahim Babangida refused to testify before a national human rights commission about the Giwa murder. Babangida, Hakilu and Togun went to court and obtained an order restraining the commission from summoning them to appear before it. The Chairman of the commission commented that the commission had the power to issue arrest warrants for the trio but decided against this \"in the over-all interest of national reconciliation\".In 2008, the Government of Nigeria named a street in the New Federal Capital Abuja after Dele Giwa, as they did with other activists such as Fela Anikulapo-Kuti and Ken Saro Wiwa", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "106_791", "question": "What kind of work does Dwight Butler do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_6043", "text": "The album's opening track \"War Pigs\" was originally intended to be called \"Walpurgis\". It was then changed to \"War Pigs\", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that the song of the same name had potential as a single. Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: \"I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' \u2013 you know, the Satanic version of Christmas \u2013 write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'.\" In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, \"It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis' ... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song ... Geezer also liked to put a lot of topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did.\"\nThe song \"Iron Man\" was originally entitled \"Iron Bloke\". Upon hearing Iommi play the main guitar riff for the first time, Osbourne remarked in awe that it sounded \"like a big iron bloke walking around\". The title was later changed to \"Iron Man\" as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. The riff to \"Iron Man\" is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that \"...Tony Iommi turned out to be one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff \u2013 and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away.\" Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. His attempts to warn the populace are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and vengeful, causing the destruction seen in his vision. \"Electric Funeral\" also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands \"it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life.\"In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne said: \"It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday ... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet.'\" \"You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world,\" Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, \"and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about \u2013 political stuff \u2013 so that's what inspired me.\"In 2013, Butler told Mojo magazine that the song \"Paranoid\" was \"about depression, because I didn't really know the difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards.\" In 2015, Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: \"I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. I used to get really depressed and it was the only thing that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself.\" According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's \"Communication Breakdown\", with the bassist admitting, \"I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it ... They were our favourite band by that time\".\n\"Planet Caravan\" was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, \"It was almost one of those 'Should we do this?'\" with Butler adding, \"We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever ... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend.\" Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. \"Hand of Doom\" dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was \"nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in my head and when we got to \"Hand of Doom\", that's what I wrote it about\".According to Butler, Ward's drum solo \"Rat Salad\" resulted from the band having to play 8 and 3/4-hour spots a night in Europe early in their career. \"Bill used to fill out a whole 45 minutes doing a drum solo just to get rid of that 45 minutes,\" he revealed to Classic Albums. \"I have no idea where the title came from, though.\" While Butler may have now forgotten where the title of \"Rat Salad\" came from, in 1971 he was on record stating it came from a joke about Ward's hair having not been combed. In 2013, Sabbath biographer Mick Wall described the closing track on the album, \"Fairies Wear Boots\", as a \"hard-driving riff sweetened by a beautifully baleful melody\" with a lyric written by Osbourne about a nasty encounter with a group of skinheads.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Tilson do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_41859", "text": "While removed from the public's gaze, Dylan and the Band made music very different from the recordings of other major artists. Andy Gill writes, \"Musically, the songs were completely at odds with what was going on in the rest of the pop world, which during the long, hot summer of 1967 was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of 'psychedelic' music\u2014mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos.\" Patrick Humphries itemizes the ways in which Dylan's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture: \"While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders, Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity. While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While Mick Jagger was 2,000 light years from home, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots.\"This aspect of the basement recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound came as a shock to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, \"Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [Dylan] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar.\" Dylan summed up the gap: \"At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads.\"When the Band began work on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they employed a recording technique similar to the one they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, \"We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique.\" That technique influenced groups including the Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record \"in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that the Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes\".\"Listening to The Basement Tapes now, it seems to be the beginning of what is called Americana or alt.country,\" wrote Billy Bragg. \"The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless\u2014and the best Americana does that as well.\" The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, \"If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts\u2014Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, the Waterboys\u2014have since tried to get back to that place.\"For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes \"sound like they were made in a cardboard box. I think [Dylan] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone. As if they sound like real folk songs\u2014because if you go back into the folk tradition, you will find songs as dark and as deep as these.\"In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked The Basement Tapes number 291 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, number 292 in a 2012 revised list, and number 335 in the magazine's 2020 list. In a special issue devoted to Dylan's work, Q magazine awarded the record five stars, its highest rating, commenting that \"Dylan's work is by turns haunting, hilarious and puzzling\u2014and all of it taps into centuries of American song\".Hip hop group Public Enemy referenced the album in their 2007 Dylan tribute song \"Long and Whining Road\": \"From basement tapes, beyond them dollars and cents / Changing of the guards spent, now where the hell the majors went?\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Despite pressure from his father to enter the family business, Knoblauch in his early 20s opted to study mathematics and science at the University of Berlin. There he became one of the star students in the laboratory of Gustav Magnus. Knoblauch's doctorate, completed in Berlin in 1847, described valuable experiments that established some of the optical properties of radiant heat (a.k.a. infrared radiation). In an article describing these experiments Knoblauch wrote that experimental facts are \"the only permanent things in science\", while abstract models are \"transitory\" and should be treated with caution and kept separate from the facts, a view that Magnus maintained also.\nAs a researcher and teacher at the University of Marburg, 1849\u201353, he produced valuable experimental demonstrations about the nature of diamagnetism. Knoblauch's student and collaborator on the diamagnetism work was John Tyndall. Tyndall and Knoblauch maintained a correspondence on and off over the next 25 years.Knoblauch moved to the University of Halle in 1853, and remained there for the rest of his career. During his first few years at Halle he did not publish anything. Later his publications were still not as frequent as they had been before moving to Halle. In his Halle years, apart from science teaching and research, he also gave his time to various administrative functions in German science including being president for 17 years of the German Academy of Sciences.

He served there for 18 months, arriving in March 1845 (his wife followed shortly after, when appropriate accommodation was found, and his sister in law Emma S.

He was able to work on restoring peace and order and in doing so, he earned a promotion to the consulate at Shanghai.Alcock, along with his wife, Henrietta, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law, moved to Shanghai in the fall of 1846, where they were part of a burgeoning community of expats, merchants and missionaries from England, France, and North America. Alcock made it a special part of his duties to superintend the established Chinese government and lay out the British settlement, which had developed into such an important feature of British commercial life in China.

At the same time, he often fails to endear himself to his fellow detectives, who resent his black-and-white attitude toward the job and his arrogant demeanor.\nFrank's religious faith is tested in the three-part premiere of Season 3 when he investigates a series of killings that are revealed to have been religiously motivated.

Pembleton reaches an agreement with Wade to admit the report was false, but word gets to the press and accusations of a cover-up costs Wade an election. When confronted, Pembleton looks to Harris, who denies that he sanctioned any agreement, and Al Giardello (who was deliberately kept in the dark) can offer no help. Disgusted with the situation, Pembleton throws down his badge and quits. However, his intuitive attitude towards his work meshes poorly with his home life, and he annoys Mary to the point that she gently pressures him to go back to work, which he eventually does.

Andy Gill writes, \"Musically, the songs were completely at odds with what was going on in the rest of the pop world, which during the long, hot summer of 1967 was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of 'psychedelic' music\u2014mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos.\" Patrick Humphries itemizes the ways in which Dylan's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture: \"While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders, Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity. While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While Mick Jagger was 2,000 light years from home, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots.\"This aspect of the basement recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound came as a shock to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, \"Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [Dylan] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar.\" Dylan summed up the gap: \"At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads.\"When the Band began work on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they employed a recording technique similar to the one they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, \"We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique.\" That technique influenced groups including the Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record \"in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that the Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes\".\"Listening to The Basement Tapes now, it seems to be the beginning of what is called Americana or alt.country,\" wrote Billy Bragg. \"The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless\u2014and the best Americana does that as well.\" The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, \"If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts\u2014Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, the Waterboys\u2014have since tried to get back to that place.\"For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes \"sound like they were made in a cardboard box. I think [Dylan] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone. As if they sound like real folk songs\u2014because if you go back into the folk tradition, you will find songs as dark and as deep as these.\"In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked The Basement Tapes number 291 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, number 292 in a 2012 revised list, and number 335 in the magazine's 2020 list. In a special issue devoted to Dylan's work, Q magazine awarded the record five stars, its highest rating, commenting that \"Dylan's work is by turns haunting, hilarious and puzzling\u2014and all of it taps into centuries of American song\".Hip hop group Public Enemy referenced the album in their 2007 Dylan tribute song \"Long and Whining Road\": \"From basement tapes, beyond them dollars and cents / Changing of the guards spent, now where the hell the majors went?\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills, intelligence, and beauty. She overthrew her husband, becoming a \"femme fatale\" figure in plays and literature over the years, usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and manipulative figure.\nIsabella arrived in England at age 12 during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful baronial factions. Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his favourite, Piers Gaveston, but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. After the death of Gaveston at the hands of the barons in 1312, however, Edward turned to a new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and attempted to take revenge on the barons, resulting in the Despenser War and a period of internal repression across England. Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser, and by 1325, her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point.\nTravelling to France on a diplomatic mission, Isabella may have begun an affair with Roger Mortimer, and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small mercenary army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King's forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming regent on behalf of her young son, Edward III. Some believe that Isabella then arranged the murder of Edward II. Isabella and Mortimer's regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the war with Scotland.\nIn 1330, aged 18, Isabella's son, Edward III forcibly asserted his authority. Mortimer was executed, Isabella's regency was ended and she was imprisoned, but soon released.

The novel started as a section of Sherman Alexie's family memoir, but after the persistence of a young adult editor, he decided to use it as a basis for his first young adult novel.  Sherman Alexie commented, \"If I were to guess at the percentage, it would be about seventy-eight percent true.\" Like Arnold, Sherman Alexie grew up on the Spokane Reservation in Wellpinit with an alcoholic father. He was also born with hydrocephalus, but Alexie did not have any speech impediments. Alexie was also teased for his government-issued, horn-rimmed glasses and nicknamed \"The Globe\" by fellow students because of his giant head. Another similarity between Alexie and his character Arnold is that Alexie also left the reservation to attend high school at Reardan High, but Alexie chose to go to Reardan to achieve the required credits he needed to go to college. Alexie became the star player of Reardan's basketball team and was the only Indian on the team besides the school's team mascot. The scene where Arnold finds that he is using the same textbook his mother did thirty years before he is drawn from Alexie's own experiences. The only difference between Alexie's life and the novel is that Alexie threw the book against the wall out of anger, and did not hit anyone as Junior did.In his own writing, Alexie unapologetically describes himself as \"kind of mixed up, kind of odd, not traditional. I'm a rez kid who's gone urban, and that's what I write about. I have never pretended to be otherwise.\" \"A smart Indian is a dangerous person,\" Alexie states in a personal essay, \"[a smart Indian is] widely feared and ridiculed by Indians and non-Indians alike.\" Junior encapsulates this type of experience when he receives strong censure both from his tribal community and from his peers and teachers at his new school, Reardan.

It is that \u201cwhereby something is effected and thus attained.\u201d In essence, it can be seen as a cause, for \u201cWhatever has an effect as its consequence is called a cause.\u201d But an end is also a cause to the extent that it determines the kind of means to be used to actualize it. As noted, \u201cThe end in keeping with which the kind of means to be used is determined is also considered a cause.\u201d This conceptualization of instrumentality as means and ends leads the question further into causality, suggesting that \u201c[w]herever ends are pursued and means are employed, wherever instrumentality reigns, there reigns causality.\u201dTo question causality, Heidegger starts from what \u201c[f]or centuries philosophy has taught\u201d regarding the traditional \"four causes.\u201d These are traditionally enumerated as (1) the \u201ccausa materialis, the material, the matter out of which\" something is made; (2) the \u201ccausa formalis, the form, the shape into which the material enters\u201d; (3) the \u201ccausa finalis, the end, in relation to which [the thing] required is determined as to its form and matter\"; and (4) the \"causa efficiens, which brings about the effect that is the finished [thing].\u201d Heidegger concludes that \u201c[w]hat technology is, when represented as a means, discloses itself when we trace instrumentality back to fourfold causality.\" To explain this, Heidegger uses the example of a silver chalice. Each element works together to create the chalice in a different manner:\n\nThus four ways of owing hold sway in the sacrificial vessel that lies ready before us. They differ from one another, yet they belong together. ... The four ways of being responsible bring something into appearance. They let it come forth into presencing. They set it free to that place and so start it on its way, namely into its complete arrival.\nWhen these four elements work together to create something into appearance, it is called bringing-forth. This bringing-forth comes from the Greek poiesis, which \"brings out of concealment into unconcealment.\" This revealing can be represented by the Greek word aletheia, which in English is translated as \"truth.\" This truth has everything to do with the essence of technology because technology is a means of revealing the truth.Modern technology, however, differs from poiesis. Heidegger suggests that this difference stems from the fact that modern technology \"is based on modern physics as an exact science.\" The revealing of modern technology, therefore, is not bringing-forth, but rather challenging-forth. To exemplify this, Heidegger draws on the Rhine River as an example of how our modern technology can change a cultural symbol.To further his discussion of modern technology, Heidegger introduces the notion of standing-reserve. Modern technology places humans in standing-reserve. To explain this, Heidegger uses the example of a forester and his relationship to the paper and print industries, as he waits in standing reserve for their wishes.Heidegger once again returns to discuss the essence of modern technology to name it Gestell, which he defines primarily as a sort of enframing:\n\nEnframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon that sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing that holds sway in the essence of modern technology and that it is itself not technological.\nOnce he has discussed enframing, Heidegger highlights the threat of technology. As he states, this threat \"does not come in the first instance from the potentially lethal machines and apparatus of technology.\" Rather, the threat is the essence because \"the rule of enframing threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to enter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth.\" This is because challenging-forth conceals the process of bringing-forth, which means that truth itself is concealed and no longer unrevealed. Unless humanity makes an effort to re-orient itself, it will not be able to find revealing and truth.\nIt is at this point that Heidegger has encountered a paradox: humanity must be able to navigate the dangerous orientation of enframing because it is in this dangerous orientation that we find the potential to be rescued. To further elaborate on this, Heidegger returns to his discussion of essence. Ultimately, he concludes that \"the essence of technology is in a lofty sense ambiguous\" and that \"such ambiguity points to the mystery of all revealing, i.e., of truth.\"The question concerning technology, Heidegger concludes, is one \"concerning the constellation in which revealing and concealing, in which the coming to presence of the truth comes to pass.\" In other words, it is finding truth. Heidegger presents art as a way to navigate this constellation, this paradox, because the artist, or the poet as Heidegger suggests, views the world as it is and as it reveals itself.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He left the service of Maldonado in 1713, being then eighteen years of age. In 1715 he became \"page\" to Don Francisco de Ocio, superintendent general of customs, who doubtless employed him as a clerk.In 1717, he attracted the favorable notice of Jos\u00e9 Pati\u00f1o, the head of the newly organized navy, and was by him transferred to the naval department. Under the protection of Pati\u00f1o, who became prime minister in 1726, Campillo was constantly employed on naval administrative work both at home and in America. It was Patino's policy to build up a navy quietly at home and in America, without attracting too much attention abroad, and particularly in England. Campillo proved an industrious and honest subordinate. Part of his experience was to be present at a shipwreck in Central America in which he was credited with showing spirit and practical ability in saving the lives of the crew.In 1726 he was denounced to the Inquisition for the offence of reading forbidden books. The proceedings against him were not carried further, but the incident is an example of the vexatious tyranny exercised by the Holy Office, and the effect it must have had even in its decadence in damping all intellectual activity.Between 1733 and 1737 he was Intendent of the Spanish army sent to Italy during the War of Polish Succession. After his return he became Intendent General of Army of Aragon.\nIn 1741, when Spain was entangled in a land war in Italy and a naval war with England, Campillo was summoned by King Philip V of Spain to take the place of minister of Finance, Navy, War and Indies. He had to find the means of carrying on a policy out of all proportion to the resources of Spain, with an empty treasury. His short tenure of power was chiefly notable for his vigorous attempt to sweep away the system of farming the taxes, which left the state at the mercy of contractors and financiers. Campillo's predecessors were constantly compelled to apply to capitalists to provide funds to meet the demands of the king for his buildings and his foreign policy.A whole year's revenue was frequently forestalled. Campillo persuaded the king to allow him to establish a system of direct collection, by which waste and pilfering would be avoided. Some progress was made towards putting the national finances on a sound footing, though Campillo could not prevent the king from disposing, without his knowledge, of large sums of money needed for the public service. He died suddenly on April 11, 1743.Campillo was the author of a treatise on a New System of Government for America printed at Madrid 1789. He also left a manuscript treatise with the curious title, What is superfluous and is wanting in Spain, in order that it may be what it ought to be, and not what it is.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Andy Gill writes, \"Musically, the songs were completely at odds with what was going on in the rest of the pop world, which during the long, hot summer of 1967 was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of 'psychedelic' music\u2014mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos.\" Patrick Humphries itemizes the ways in which Dylan's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture: \"While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders, Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity. While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While Mick Jagger was 2,000 light years from home, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots.\"This aspect of the basement recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound came as a shock to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, \"Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [Dylan] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar.\" Dylan summed up the gap: \"At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads.\"When the Band began work on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they employed a recording technique similar to the one they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, \"We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique.\" That technique influenced groups including the Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record \"in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that the Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes\".\"Listening to The Basement Tapes now, it seems to be the beginning of what is called Americana or alt.country,\" wrote Billy Bragg. \"The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless\u2014and the best Americana does that as well.\" The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, \"If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency.

They had a son named Charles Godfrey Haggas Cutcliffe Hyne (1 December 1897 \u2013 21 November 1916), who was wounded in the Battle of the Somme and died from his wounds. They also had a daughter, Nancy Mildred Cutcliffe Hyne (1902\u20131999).\nCaptain Kettle first appeared as a side character in the novel Honour of Thieves (1895). His first appearance as a main character was in the short story 'Stealing a President' in vol 1, issue 6 of Pearson's Magazine (1896). This initial short story was followed in 1897 by a series of twelve short stories again in Pearson's Magazine that were later collected and published as Adventures of Captain Kettle. Over the next four years two more sets of twelve stories were published in Pearson's Magazine and subsequently collected as Further Adventures of Captain Kettle (\"A master of fortune\" in the US) and Captain Kettle K.C.B. respectively.\nThe character of Captain Kettle was one of action and decision. He is said to be based on a South Shields sea captain, Davey Proffit, whose physical appearance closely matched the descriptions in the books, but Cutcliffe Hyne insisted emphatically that this was not the case. However, the most enduring image of Kettle was created by Stanley L. Wood, who provided the illustrations for Pearson's Magazine; they were reprinted in the first book compilations of the stories. He found 'the exact spit and image of our little sailor, pulling beer behind a bar' in a pub in north London. This is noteworthy because Wood's Captain Kettle bears a striking resemblance (particularly in his stance, the set of the head on the shoulders, his beard and the characteristic gaze) to the novelist Joseph Conrad, also a sailor. Among the people who saw this remarkable similarity was H. G. Wells, whose War of the Worlds appeared in Pearson's in instalments, alternating with the Captain Kettle stories. Conrad met Wells at just this time, read Pearson's, and borrowed whole phrases, key episodes, and images from the Kettle stories for Heart of Darkness.\nCutcliffe Hyne would probably have been forgotten but for the American science fiction fans such as Sprague de Camp. They republished The Lost Continent without permission, possible because of the then American copyright law, which led to the republishing of his other stories.", "hasanswer": false}]}

By day he was a studio musician who worked with many recording artists such as Paul Anka and Del Shannon. Vincent had his own jazz band, billed \"Frank Vincent and the Aristocats,\" that played in the evenings. In 1969, Vincent's band needed a piano player to secure bookings and Vincent ended up hiring Joe Pesci to play guitar. As the popularity of lounge music waned, Vincent and Pesci turned to stand-up comedy, performing as \"Vincent and Pesci\" from 1970 to 1976. Their act coupled Abbott and Costello-inspired double act antics with Don Rickles-style insult comedy, which proved popular. During this time, the men developed a strong professional and personal friendship.Vincent and Pesci later landed parts in the low-budget gangster film The Death Collector (1976), where they were spotted by Robert De Niro. De Niro told Martin Scorsese about both Vincent and Pesci. Scorsese was impressed by their performances and hired Vincent to appear in a supporting role in Raging Bull (1980), in which he once again appeared with Pesci and co-starred with De Niro. Vincent appeared in small roles in two Spike Lee films: Do the Right Thing (1989) and Jungle Fever (1991). In the latter, he played the abusive patriarch of an Italian-American family.One of his notable appearances in foreign films was as a supporting character in Juan Jos\u00e9 Jusid's Made in Argentina (1987), in which he played Vito, a wealthy Manhattan businessman who befriends the film's protagonist, a substance-abuse counselor who treated Vito's son, played by Luis Brandoni.Vincent was often cast as a gangster. For example, in  Scorsese's film Goodfellas (1990), he played Billy Batts, a made man in the Gambino crime family; he also played a role in Scorsese's film Casino (1995) as Frank Marino (based on real-life gangster Frank Cullotta), the sidekick of Pesci's character.In 1996, Vincent appeared in the music video for rap artist Nas' song \"Street Dreams.\" In the television movie Gotti (1996), Vincent played Robert \"D.B.\" DiBernardo, an associate of Mafia boss John Gotti's, whose life the film chronicled.  Vincent appeared in a small role in the 1998 film Belly, starring Nas and DMX and directed by Hype Williams. Vincent would also serve as an acting coach on the film.  In the HBO TV series The Sopranos, he had his most prominent role as Phil Leotardo, a ruthless New York City gangster who, as boss of the show's fictional Lupertazzi crime family, becomes the show's chief antagonist in the final season.In 1999, he won the Italian American Entertainer of the Year Award. Another noted performance is his appearance in the film Remedy (2003).In 2003, Vincent portrayed Danny Santini in the film This Thing of Ours, whose associate producer was Sonny Franzese, longtime mobster and underboss of the Colombo crime family, and whose director was Genovese crime family capo Danny Provenzano (grandnephew of Anthony Provenzano). Later that year, Vincent testified in court on the behalf of Provenzano at repeal sentences; Provenzano was serving a 10-year sentence for racketeering and other charges.One of Vincent's lighter-hearted roles was in a British television commercial for Peugeot cars. In early 2005, he appeared on Irish television in a series of commercials for Irish bank Permanent TSB.In video games, Vincent voiced the character of Mafia boss Salvatore Leone in the video game Grand Theft Auto III (2001). He later reprised the role in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004) and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories (2005).In 2006 he released a book, A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man to positive reviews.

Between 1913 and 1920 William (Bill) worked as a reporter for a Reading, Pennsylvania newspaper.  He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1920 and started work for William Randolph Hearst's International News Service (INS).  As an INS reporter, he covered the John T. Scopes trial, also known as the  Scopes Trial, in Dayton, Tennessee and on July 24, 1925 he was the first reporter to file the dispatch stating the outcome.  A conversation that occurred during the last days of the trial, Scopes said:\n\"There's something I must tell you. It's worried me. I didn't violate the law ...I never taught that evolution lesson. I skipped it. I was doing something else the day I should have taught it, and I missed the whole lesson about Darwin and never did teach it. Those kids they put on the stand couldn't remember what I taught them three months ago. They were coached by the lawyers.\" \"Honest, I've been scared all through the trial that the kids might remember I missed the lesson. I was afraid they'd get on the stand and say I hadn't taught it and then the whole trial would go blooey. If that happened they would run me out of town on a rail.\"When Bill mentioned that would make a great news story, John responded, \"My god no! Not a word of it until the Supreme Court passes my appeal. My lawyers would kill me.\"  In L. Sprague de Camp's book, The Great Monkey Trial, de Camp goes on to say that Bill claimed he overheard Clarence Darrow coaching the students on what to say, however, even with coaching, only one of the students implied that Scopes taught evolution.Bill also covered the national political conventions and events in the Capitol.  In 1939 he was the Bureau Chief of the International News Service in Washington, D.C.  In late 1949, during a game of hearts, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Bill came up with the idea for a list of names, photographs, and descriptions of the ten worst criminals wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  On March 14, 1950, the list was compiled and distributed as the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list.Following his transatlantic solo flight and return to the United States in 1927, Charles Lindbergh gave his flight jacket to Bill.  He wore this jacket on many outings and kept it until his death.  The jacket was then willed to his brother Herb.  By the time of Herb's death in 1986,  the jacket had so deteriorated that it was mistakenly thrown out by someone who did not realize its historic value.Bill was a member of the bar in the District of Columbia and wrote two books, Life and Works of William E. Borah and Ten Days that Changed the World, the latter being an account of the ten days between the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan. For many years he was owner and the Vice President of the Washington Redskins football team.  A World War I veteran, Bill received numerous awards from the Air Force, Army, and Navy for patriotic service.Bill was the president of the Senate Press Gallery for over 20 years.  As a token of appreciation for Bill's aid in having the Congressional press galleries renovated, the standing committee of House and Senate correspondents today presented a silver punch bowl to William K. Hutchinson of International News Service.

Andy Gill writes, \"Musically, the songs were completely at odds with what was going on in the rest of the pop world, which during the long, hot summer of 1967 was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of 'psychedelic' music\u2014mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos.\" Patrick Humphries itemizes the ways in which Dylan's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture: \"While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders, Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity. While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While Mick Jagger was 2,000 light years from home, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots.\"This aspect of the basement recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound came as a shock to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, \"Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [Dylan] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar.\" Dylan summed up the gap: \"At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads.\"When the Band began work on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they employed a recording technique similar to the one they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, \"We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique.\" That technique influenced groups including the Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record \"in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that the Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes\".\"Listening to The Basement Tapes now, it seems to be the beginning of what is called Americana or alt.country,\" wrote Billy Bragg. \"The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless\u2014and the best Americana does that as well.\" The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, \"If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts\u2014Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, the Waterboys\u2014have since tried to get back to that place.\"For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes \"sound like they were made in a cardboard box.

Dowding is best known for his work on \"power\", applying insights from formal analysis to central debates on the nature of power and structure of power in society. Expanding on Brian Barry's concept of \"luck\" (getting what you want without trying) he argues that some groups of people are \"systematically lucky\" in that they are advantaged because of the way society is structured. Such people are not powerful in the sense they have resources that they could use that other groups do not (though they might have this power as well) but rather systematically lucky in that they tend to get what they want without having to do anything. Alternatively, other groups are systematically unlucky. This argument has caused great controversy with critics including Brian Barry, Steven Lukes, Peter Morriss and more recently Andrew Hindmoor.Dowding has also worked on the Tiebout model of individuals moving location to get the local services they require, showing that such moving does occur in the UK though only to a small extent, and that people tend to move to areas for service reasons, but do not decide to leave from areas for those reasons. He has extended this work into examining Albert Hirschman's Exit, Voice and Loyalty Model and has a forthcoming Cambridge University Press book Exits, Voices and Social Investment co-authored with long-time collaborator Peter John extending and applying Hirschman's model to citizen satisfaction with government services.\nDowding also considered the theory of presidentialisation of British politics in his 2012 article, \u201cThe Prime Ministerialization of the British Prime Minister\u201d. The article challenges Michael Foley\u2019s theory that British politics is becoming increasingly similar to that of a presidential system. Dowding instead suggests that the British prime minister is gaining power, but only enhancing the responsibilities that he already possesses rather than adopting new powers that are more closely attributed to the United States\u2019 President.\nMore recently his work has examined why UK cabinet ministers resign based on a large dataset of all UK ministerial resignations and non-resignations, and compiled another on Australia.

He always joked about the fact that he, a big man, was baptized Giovannino, a name meaning \"little John\" or \"Johnny\".\nIn 1926, his family went bankrupt and he could not continue his studies at the University of Parma. After working at various minor jobs, he started to write for a local newspaper, the Gazzetta di Parma. In 1929 he became editor of the satirical magazine Corriere Emiliano, and from 1936 to 1943 he was the chief editor of a similar magazine called Bertoldo.In 1943 he was drafted into the army, which apparently helped him to avoid trouble with the Italian Fascist authorities. He ended up as an artillery officer.\nWhen Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in 1943, he was arrested as an Italian military internee and imprisoned with other Italian soldiers in camps in German-occupied Poland for almost two years, including at Stalag X-B near Sandbostel. He later wrote about this period in Diario Clandestino (My Secret Diary).\n\nAfter the war Guareschi returned to Italy and in 1945 founded a monarchist weekly satirical magazine, Candido. After Italy became a republic, he supported the Democrazia Cristiana party. He criticized and satirized the Communists in his magazine, famously drawing a Communist as a man with an extra nostril, and coining a slogan that became very popular: \"Inside the voting booth God can see you, Stalin can't.\" When the Communists were defeated in the 1948 Italian general election, Guareschi did not put his pen down but also criticized the Democrazia Cristiana party.\nIn 1950, Candido published a satirical cartoon by Carlo Manzoni poking fun at Luigi Einaudi, President of the Republic. The President is at the Quirinal Palace, surrounded by, instead of the presidential guard of honour (the corazzieri), giant bottles of Nebbiolo wine, which Einaudi actually produced on his land in Dogliani. Each bottle was labeled with the institutional logo. The cartoon was judged 'in Contempt of the President' by a court at the time. Guareschi, as the director of the magazine, was held responsible and sentenced.\nIn 1954 Guareschi was charged with libel after he published two facsimile wartime letters from resistance leader and former Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi requesting that the Allies bomb the outskirts of Rome in order to demoralize German collaborators. The legitimacy of the letters was never established by the court, but after a two-month trial it found in favour of De Gasperi.  Guareschi declined to appeal the verdict and spent 409 days in Parma's San Francesco jail, and another six months on probation at his home.His most famous comic creations are his short stories, begun in the late 1940s, about the rivalry between Don Camillo, a stalwart Italian priest, and the equally hot-headed Peppone, Communist mayor of a Po River Valley village in the \"Little World.\" These stories were dramatized on radio, television and in films, most notably in the series of films featuring Fernandel as Don Camillo.\nBy 1956 Guareschi's health had deteriorated and he began spending time in Switzerland for treatment. In 1957 he retired as editor of Candido but remained a contributor.\nHe died in Cervia in 1968 of a heart attack, at age 60.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His father was a federal public servant who later was Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, and Whitlam senior's involvement in human rights issues was a powerful influence on his son. Since his maternal grandfather was also named Edward, from early childhood he was called by his middle name, Gough, which in turn had come from his paternal grandfather who had been named after the British soldier Field-Marshal Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough.In 1918, Fred Whitlam was promoted to deputy Crown solicitor and transferred to Sydney. The family lived first in the North Shore suburb of Mosman and then in Turramurra.

They were born to a Jewish family. Both were interested in science and mathematics, but Alfred was injured in combat in World War I. As a boy, Richard dreamt of becoming an inventor, and in February 1919 enrolled in Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg. He soon transferred to University of Berlin. Except for the summer of 1920 when he studied at University of Freiburg, he studied in Berlin, being awarded his PhD on 16 March 1926. Issai Schur conducted a seminar and posed a problem in 1921 that Alfred and Richard worked on together, and published a result. The problem also was solved by Heinz Hopf at the same time. Richard wrote his thesis under Schur, providing an algebraic approach to irreducible, continuous, finite-dimensional representations of real orthogonal (rotation) groups.\nIlse Karger also studied mathematics at the University of Berlin; she and Brauer were married 17 September 1925. Their sons George Ulrich (born 1927) and Fred Gunther (born 1932) also became mathematicians. Brauer began his teaching career in K\u00f6nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) working as Konrad Knopp\u2019s assistant. Brauer expounded central division algebras over a perfect field while in K\u00f6nigsberg; the isomorphism classes of such algebras form the elements of the Brauer group he introduced.\nWhen the Nazi Party took over in 1933, the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars took action to help Brauer and other Jewish scientists. Brauer was offered an assistant professorship at University of Kentucky. Brauer accepted the offer, and by the end of 1933 he was in Lexington, Kentucky, teaching in English. Ilse followed the next year with George and Fred; brother Alfred made it to the United States in 1939, but their sister Alice was killed in the Holocaust.Hermann Weyl invited Brauer to assist him at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study in 1934. Brauer and Nathan Jacobson edited Weyl's lectures Structure and Representation of Continuous Groups. Through the influence of Emmy Noether, Brauer was invited to University of Toronto to take up a faculty position. With his graduate student Cecil J. Nesbitt he developed modular representation theory, published in 1937.  Robert Steinberg, Stephen Arthur Jennings, and Ralph Stanton were also Brauer\u2019s students in Toronto. Brauer also conducted international research with Tadasi Nakayama on representations of algebras. In 1941 University of Wisconsin hosted visiting professor Brauer. The following year he visited the Institute for Advanced Study and Bloomington, Indiana where Emil Artin was teaching.\nIn 1948, Brauer moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan where he and Robert M.

Justman do?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_16189", "text": "After the success of the contemporary Star Trek feature films, a new Star Trek television series featuring a new cast was announced on October 10, 1986. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry named Picard for (one or both of) the twin brothers Auguste Piccard and Jean Piccard, 20th-century Swiss scientists.Patrick Stewart, who has a background in live theater at the Royal Shakespeare Company, was initially considered for the role of Data. In the early 1970s, UCSB professor Homer Swander had recruited Stewart to help teach American college students about William Shakespeare. It was because of this connection that in 1986, Stewart was visiting UCLA to assist professor David Rodes with a series of public lectures on Shakespeare. At one of those lectures, producer Robert H. Justman immediately recognized that Stewart was the ideal candidate for Picard.Roddenberry originally did not want to cast Stewart as Picard, since he had envisioned an actor who was \"masculine, virile, and had a lot of hair\". Roddenberry's first choice was Stephen Macht, and it took \"weeks of discussion\" with Justman, Rick Berman, and the casting director to convince him that \"Stewart was the one they had been looking for to sit in the captain's chair\"; Roddenberry agreed after auditioning every other candidate for the role. The other actors considered included Yaphet Kotto, Patrick Bauchau, Roy Thinnes and Mitchell Ryan. Kotto turned down the role as he was concerned about shifting his career over to television after having a prolific film career; he would later regret the decision, calling it a \"wrong decision\". Edward James Olmos was also offered the role, but he declined as he wasn't interested.Stewart was uncertain why the producers would cast \"a middle-aged bald English Shakespearean actor\" as captain of the Enterprise. He had his toupee delivered from London to meet with Paramount executives, but Roddenberry ordered Stewart to remove the \"awful looking\" hairpiece. Stewart's stentorian voice impressed the executives, who immediately approved the casting. Roddenberry sent Stewart C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels, saying the Picard character was based on Hornblower, but Stewart was already familiar with the character, having read the books as a teenager.As the series progressed, Stewart exercised more control over the character's development. By the time production began on the first Next Generation film, \"it was impossible to tell where Jean-Luc started and Patrick Stewart ended\", and by the fourth film, Stewart stated:\n\nI find myself talking a lot about Picard and one of the things that I've come to understand is that as I talk a lot about Picard what I find is I'm talking about myself.\nThere was a sort of double action that occurred. In one sense, Picard was expanding like this and at the same time he was also growing closer and closer to me as well and, in some respect, I suppose even had some influence on me. I became a better listener than I ever had been as a result of playing Jean-Luc Picard because it was one of the things that he does terrifically well.\nHowever, Stewart stated that he is not nearly as serious or brooding as his alter ego.Stewart also stated, \"One of the delights of having done this series and played this role is that people are so attracted to the whole idea of Star Trek ... several years after the series has ended ... I enjoy hearing how much people enjoyed the work we did ... It's always gratifying to me that this bald, middle-aged Englishman seems to connect with them\". Stewart has commented that his role has helped open up Shakespeare to science fiction fans. He has noted the \"regular presence of Trekkies in the audience\" whenever he plays theater, and added: \"I meet these people afterwards, I get letters from them and see them at the stage door ... And they say, 'I've never seen Shakespeare before, I didn't think I'd understand it, but it was wonderful and I can't wait to come back.'\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

A typical set in 1991 included a wide variety of styles and periods of music, as Rubin later explained: \"We were doing Mississippi John Hurt, gospel tunes, Captain Beefheart\u2014anything, really, but it was Mot\u00f6rhead or the Misfits that caught on.\"Imprecise descriptions of the Bad Livers' music abounded: \"thrash-grass\", \"acoustic bluegrass with a punk death wish\", \"something called 'contemporary bluegrass,'\" and \"acoustic-metal-bluegrass\", although these same sources would cite the band as \"much-lauded\" and note that \"the musicians can really play\". The recurrence of the term bluegrass, however bizarrely it was modified, along with counter-assessments of them as \"good, faithful traditionalists\" who \"preserve the spirit as well as the technique of old-timey folk music\", created a generic perplexity that led Austin country legend Don Walser to observe that the only question he couldn't answer was what kind of music the Bad Livers played.Barnes insisted that the Bad Livers were not a bluegrass band, but had created an original sound: \"This isn't bluegrass and it isn't this or that. It's Bad Liver music. We end up making our own thing.\" Barnes' original compositions were featured on their first album, Delusions of Banjer, released in 1992 on Quarterstick Records and produced by Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers. The album was praised for \"Barnes's strong material, as well as the group's tight musical interaction\". Barnes credited the latter with improving the former: \"The musical telepathy is really good. I can sort of tailor-make a song to the guys' playing, make the song fit what they're doing, since I write most of the material.\"Rubin claimed that they had decided to incorporate the accordion and tuba into the band to counteract their growing popularity, but to no avail: their audience continued to widen and more critics saw beyond the gimmicky descriptions to the band's innovation and skill. The Washington Post described them as \"truly great\", The Times-Picayune praised their \"serious musicianship\" and Barnes' \"soulful, urgent lead vocals\", while Rolling Stone admired their \"striking blend of virtuoso flash and poignant simplicity\". Don McLeese of the Austin American-Statesman twice described the Bad Livers as \"Austin's best band\" and raved of one live show: \"The uncommon telepathy enjoyed by Danny Barnes, Mark Rubin and Ralph White makes the band's frenetic acoustic interplay sound like the work of a six-armed, multistringed monster.\" Barnes was voted \"Best Player of Any Other Instrument\" for the banjo at the Austin Music Awards in 1991 and 1992, and the Bad Livers were voted \"Best None of the Above\" for four consecutive years from 1991 to 1994.The Bad Livers' second album, Horses in the Mines, was produced by Barnes and released on Quarterstick in 1994. In his review, McLeese admired them as \"a band drawing from the wellspring of tradition to create something fresh, vital and original\". S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung found that the record \"sounded quite authentic\u2014almost as if it had long held a place in the Library of Congress\". Raoul Hern\u00e1ndez poetically concurred, saying that the record sounded \"like a bunch of skeletons cackling into the sole microphone that dangles from the outhouse ceiling\".The Bad Livers spent 1995 and 1996 touring and working on side projects as well as looking for a new label to release their next album. Finally the band signed a three-album deal with Sugar Hill Records, which had more experience than Quarterstick at \"selling banjo records\". Their first album for the label, Hogs on the Highway, was released along with the information that White had decided to leave the band. It was announced that he was to be replaced by Bob Grant, though Grant's tenure with the band did not last long. Both White and Grant appeared on Hogs on the Highway, which received enthusiastic reviews from Sing Out!, praising Barnes' \"quirky and inventive\" original songs, and the Old-Time Herald, admiring the \"considerable skill\" with which Barnes crafted his lyrics. The Austin American-Statesman agreed that Barnes was \"an entirely underrated songwriter\" as well as a \"banjo wizard\", while The Washington Post lauded his \"timeless, deadpan voice\". The Sydney Morning Herald was appreciative of the \"beautifully controlled ambience\" of the entire album.\nShortly after the album's release, Barnes moved from Austin to Port Hadlock, Washington, though he and Rubin continued to work closely together on the score for the Richard Linklater film The Newton Boys as well as the Bad Livers' next album. Although the soundtrack was admired by The Village Voice and Entertainment Weekly as well as the Austin papers, the film did not fare well at the box office, and the soundtrack album did not sell well. The Bad Livers' second album for Sugar Hill, Industry and Thrift, was released in September 1998 with only Barnes and Rubin credited as members of the band, though the album features various guest musicians, including members of Rubin's side project, Rubinchik\u2019s Orkestyr, who are featured on the track \"A Yid Ist Geboren inz Oklahoma\". The album garnered positive reviews, and the Chicago Tribune selected it as the best bluegrass album of 1998, while The Times of London admired its \"genuine originality\". Industry and Thrift did not receive as much attention from the press as Hogs on the Highway had, however, and as Barnes lamented, the album \"fell off the face of the earth\".The Bad Livers' final album, Blood and Mood, was released in February 2000 and featured, as The Austin Chronicle noted with astonishment: \"Electric punk rock, sample-based tunes with drum tracks, and a shocking scarcity of juiced-up banjo playing\". The Independent named it \"the leftfield album of the week\" and found that it \"brims with enthusiastic ideas\", while The Washington Post was puzzled but invigorated by a live show supporting the album, concluding that it had been \"Fascinating. Even refreshing\". Although it left No Depression depressed, Daniel Wolff found the album to be uniquely evocative of a \"rural eccentricity\" that had not yet been extinguished and formed a kind of continuum with punk and old-time country: \"Either the Bad Livers pick up where 'I Wish I Were a Mole in the Ground' left off, or Bascom Lunsford discovered the punk aesthetic in the 1920s.\" Blood and Mood did not sell well, and by the summer of 2000 the Bad Livers appeared to be \"over for good\".The Bad Livers were inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame in 2007.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Since his death, Jeet Kune Do is argued to have split into different groups. They are:\nThe Original (or Jun Fan) JKD branch, whose proponents include Taky Kimura, James Lee, Jerry Poteet, and Ted Wong;  these groups claim to teach what was believed to be only what was taught by Bruce Lee, and encourage the student to further develop his or her abilities through those teachings.  The inherent training principles of this branch are shaped by the static concept of what was \"originally taught\", just as the training systems of \"traditional\" martial arts have been taught for centuries and become recognizable as \"styles\", except it is referred to as a philosophy of \"style without style\".\nThe JKD Concepts branch, whose proponents include Dan Inosanto, Richard Bustillo, and Larry Hartsell; these groups strive to continue the philosophy of individual self-expression through re-interpretation of combat systems through the lens of Jeet Kune Do, under the concept that it was never meant to be a static art but rather an ongoing evolution, and have incorporated elements from many other martial arts into the main fold of its teachings (most notably, grappling and Kali / Escrima material) based on the individual's personal preferences and physical attributes.  The entire JKD \"system\" can be described through a simple diagram, and the concepts can then be applied to a variety of contexts in a \"universal\" way.To understand the branches of JKD it is important to understand the difference between the two \"types\" or viewpoints of Jeet Kune Do:\n\nJKD framework: This type of JKD provides the guiding principles.  Bruce Lee experimented with many styles and techniques to reach these conclusions.  To Lee these principles were truisms.  The JKD framework is not bound or confined by any styles or systems.  This type of JKD is a process.\nJKD Personal Systems: This type of JKD utilizes the JKD framework along with any techniques from any other style or system to construct a \"personal system\". This approach utilizes a \"building blocks\" manner in which to construct a personalized system that is especially tailored to an individual. Lee believed that only an individual could determine for themselves what the usefulness of any technique should be.  This type of JKD is thus a product.Lee believed that this freedom of adoption was a distinguishing property from traditional martial arts.There are many who confuse the JKD Framework with a JKD Personal System (IE. Bruce Lee's personal JKD) thinking them to be one and the same.  The system that Bruce Lee personally expressed was his own personal JKD; tailored for himself.  Before he could do this, however, he needed to first develop the \"JKD Framework\" process. Many of the systems that Bruce Lee studied were not to develop his \"Personal JKD\" but rather was used to gather the \"principles\" for incorporation in the JKD Framework approach. The uniqueness of JKD to Lee is that it was a \"process\" not a \"product\" and thus not a \"style\" but a system, concept, or approach.  Traditional martial arts styles are essentially a product that is given to a student with little provision for change.  These traditional styles are usually fixed and not tailored for individuals. Bruce Lee claimed there were inherent problems with this approach and established a \"Process\" based system rather than a fixed style which a student could then utilize to make a \"tailored\" or \"Personal\" product of their own.The two branches of JKD differ in what should be incorporated or offered within the \"JKD Framework\".  The Original (or Jun Fan) JKD branch believes that the original principles before Bruce Lee died are all that is needed for the construction of personalized systems.JKD Concepts branch believe that there are further principles that can be added to construct personalized systems.  The value of each Branch can be determined by individual practitioners based on whatever merits they deem important.Original JKD is further divided into two points of view.\nOJKD and JFJKD both hold Wing Chun, Western boxing and fencing as the cornerstones on Bruce's JKD.\n\nOJKD follows all Bruce's training from early Jun Fan Gung Fu (Seattle period) and focuses on trapping with Wing Chun influence.\nJun Fan Jeet Kune Do is a signature version of JKD as Bruce taught privately to Ted Wong. This is a later time period and practices a greater emphasis on elusiveness and simplified trapping unique to Bruce's later approach to combat. The focus is with fencing and Western boxing.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In his endorsement of the book, 350.org founder Bill McKibben writes \"As Adrian Parr [Zaretsky] suggests in a timely fashion, imagination may be the best weapon we have in the fight against environmental destruction, as useful as a new engine or a bigger windmill.\"  Ananya Roy, author of Poverty Capital: Microfinance and the Making of Development, describes her book, as \"one that not only provides a rigorous and critical analysis of emergent environmentalism but also charts how imaginations of a 'new earth' can be forged at the limits of liberal democracy.  In this sense, the book is as much about the political as it is about the environment.  It is a must-read for our times.\" Henry Giroux, author of America at War with Itself, noted that \"Birth Of A New Earth is one of those rare and brilliant books that critiques the ongoing destruction of the environment in a writing style that is lyrical compassionate and as accessible as it is informative. She masterfully weaves together a language of critique and possibility and in doing so makes a convincing case of environmental and economic justice on a global scale and offers a powerful argument for rethinking the meaning and practice of politics.\" The book explores how activists and popular movements are fighting the environmental crisis of climate change and the ongoing devastation of the earth.  The influence of the growing environment can be seen in how corporate mission statements, government policy, and national security agendas now focus much more on sustainability.  Parr maintains political scenarios for change often pursue either a revolutionary platform or a reformist agenda.  She argues these are false choices as she advocates for an emancipatory political imagination, maintaining that environmental politics engages the twofold problem of democratization and decolonization.\nParr, Adrian (212). The Wrath of Capital: Neoliberalism and Climate Change Politics. New York City, New York: Columbia University Press. ISBN 0231158289.\nThis monograph has been commended by a number of experts in the environmental profession.  Raj Patel, the author of the two books Stuffed and Starved and the Value of Nothing, said of her book, \"With this short, pointed, and very welcome text, [she] blends political theory and startling fact to refresh our understanding about the capitalist roots of environmental change.\"  Her work investigates the intersection of social and environmental justice issues, arguing that the neoliberalism framework is hurting climate change talks and policy. Adrian Parr Zaretsky concentrates on how those with the most economic power continue to have control over the environmental change discourse. Many scholars felt this work contributed greatly to the field.  In a positive review of this work, M. M. Gunter Jr., of Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., wrote she \"presents an engaging, hard-cutting critique of neoliberalism, arguing more transformative politics are needed to address climate change and sustainability problems worldwide but that a \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 of market mechanisms under the dominant neoliberal paradigm prevents viable alternatives from emerging.\"  In Global Environmental Politics, Rebecca Pearse, a research associate working on the Global Arenas of Knowledge at the University of Sydney, writes that the book gives scholars and activists, who are looking for an introduction of leftist critiques on environmental politics, will receive a good summary from her book.  Critical of this work, John Bellamy Foster, a sociology professor at the University of Oregon, writes in \"Contemporary Sociology,\" she \"confuses matters by providing seemingly conflicting definitions of \u2018neoliberalism,\u2019 which she describes as (1) \u2018a more virulent strain\u2019 of the liberalism inherited from Adam Smith,\u2019 (2) \u2018a cultural mode of production that in turn defines the political economy,\u2019 and (3) a particular \u2018agenda.'\"  He says Adrian Parr Zaretsky allows readers to use words such as \"capital,\" \"capitalism, and \"the law of value,\" interchangeably, when the three words have three, different meanings.  Ryder W.

ISBN 978-0262517461.\n\u00b7 In this work, she argues that contemporary environmental activism, rather than helping redress environmental issues, is actually hurting these same issues.  She uses five examples of where the capitalists are hijacking sustainability: corporate image-greening, Hollywood activism, gated communities, the greening of the White House, and the incongruous efforts to achieve a \u2018sustainable\u2019 army. These examples are used to help explain how architecture, especially urban spaces, add to global inequality by contributing more distinct boundaries between areas with and without poverty.    This work received several positive reviews. Jean Hillier, a professor at RMIT University's School of Global, Urban & Social Studies in Australia, writes when reviewing \"Hijacking Sustainability,\" in the journal of \"Deleuze Studies,\" that \"Parr maps the physical as well as intellectual spaces that construct boundaries between \u2018normal/indecent, honest/criminal, and neighborly/threatening\u2019 (135).\"  Antonelli Monika, an associate professor at Minnesota State University, writes in, \"the Electric Green Journal,\" that her work \"is a needed addition to environmental literature field due to the fact that there is limited information available on the attack on and the greenwashing of sustainability\" (p. 209). Daniel Barber, an associate professor and associate chair at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Design, wrote in the \"American Book Review\" journal that \"Parr [Zaretsky]\u2019s (piece) is the most theoretically sophisticated of this recent wave of environmentalist critique, and she provides a valuable interpretation of sustainability through the frameworks of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri\" (p. 4).  In a critical review of this work, R. Moore, with the University of Toronto, argues that she failed to adequately define the core term \"sustainability.\" While a difficult task, greater clarity is required in order to avoid an argument that is \"at best vague and at worst incomprehensible\" (p. 284).  Failing to clarify the term \"sustainability culture,\" Moore contends that readers do not get a good description of the type of individuals and organizations who can further environmental progress without adding to the capitalistic machine.  Monika notes she would like to see Adrian Parr Zaretsky add solutions about way people can fix this problem of \"Hijacking Sustainability.\"According to WorldCat, the book is held in 420 libraries \nParr, Adrian (2008).

Ludwig von Bertalanffy grew up as an only child educated at home by private tutors until he was ten and his parents divorced, both remarried outside the Catholic Church in civil ceremonies. When he arrived at his Gymnasium (a form of grammar school) he was already well habituated in learning by reading, and he continued to study on his own. His neighbour, the famous biologist Paul Kammerer, became a mentor and an example to the young Ludwig.The Bertalanffy family had roots in the 16th century nobility of Hungary which included several scholars and court officials. His grandfather Charles Joseph von Bertalanffy (1833\u20131912) had settled in Austria and was a state theatre director in Klagenfurt, Graz and Vienna, which were important sites in imperial Austria. Ludwig's father Gustav von Bertalanffy (1861\u20131919) was a prominent railway administrator. On his mother's side Ludwig's grandfather Joseph Vogel was an imperial counsellor and a wealthy Vienna publisher. \nIn 1918, Bertalanffy started his studies at the university level in philosophy and art history, first at the University of Innsbruck and then at the University of Vienna. Ultimately, Bertalanffy had to make a choice between studying philosophy of science and biology; he chose the latter because, according to him, one could always become a philosopher later, but not a biologist. In 1926 he finished his PhD thesis (Fechner und das Problem der Integration h\u00f6herer Ordnung, translated title: Fechner and the Problem of Higher-Order Integration) on the psychologist and philosopher Gustav Theodor Fechner. For the next six years he concentrated on a project of \"theoretical biology\" which focused on the philosophy of biology. He received his habilitation in 1934 in \"theoretical biology\".Bertalanffy was appointed Privatdozent at the University of Vienna in 1934. The post yielded little income, and Bertalanffy faced continuing financial difficulties. He applied for promotion to the status of associate professor, but funding from the Rockefeller Foundation enabled him to make a trip to Chicago in 1937 to work with Nicolas Rashevsky. He was also able to visit the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts.Bertalanffy was still in the US when he heard of the Anschluss in March 1938. However, his attempts to remain in the US failed, and he returned to Vienna in October of that year. Within a month of his return, he joined the Nazi Party, which facilitated his promotion to professor at the University of Vienna in 1940. During the Second World War, he linked his \"organismic\" philosophy of biology to the dominant Nazi ideology, principally that of the F\u00fchrerprinzip.Following the defeat of Nazism, Bertalanffy found denazification problematic and left Vienna in 1948. He moved to the University of London (1948\u201349); the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (1949); the University of Ottawa (1950\u201354); the University of Southern California (1955\u201358); the Menninger Foundation (1958\u201360); the University of Alberta (1961\u201368); and the State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY) (1969\u201372).\nIn 1972, he died from a heart attack.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He can play at exceptionally fast speeds, and does a signature 3-finger walk (a \"galloping\" finger motion). He revealed in a making-of DVD for Cannibal Corpse's album The Wretched Spawn that he initially started playing guitar but changed to bass because he felt he could master the instrument more quickly. Unlike usual heavy metal bassists that play at high speeds, Webster is able to play his instrument without the use of a pick, while still retaining a clean clear tone, which helps maintain clarity in the complex and very fast lines he plays in conjunction with the heavily distorted guitars of Cannibal Corpse.\n\n\"When I was six years old I took some acoustic guitar lessons. It didn't really work out because I was six and didn't really want to learn \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" and those were the kind of songs I was being taught. I wanted to play Elvis. I liked all the old 50s music. My dad had a bunch of old 50s records because that's when he was a teenager. Those were what I listened to, because when you're six you don't have the money to go buy stuff, so I just listened to his records. Nobody was going to teach me how to play the guitar like that, out in the country where I lived. I just gave it up until I was 13 or 14. I met a kid in school who played bass in the high school jazz band. He wanted to make some extra money and it was five bucks a lesson. He did a good job too. His name was Mike Hudson. I don't know if he plays anymore. I lost touch with him. He's the one that got me started. I always wanted to play in a band, and to learn how to play lead guitar was going to take like five years. But I really liked the sound of the bass. I liked AC/DC and figured I could do that. I thought I could learn Cliff Williams' bass parts faster than I could learn to play Angus Young's guitar parts. It was motivation, because I wanted to be in a band. I never wanted to sit around and play music by myself. I wanted to play with other people, and the fastest route to that was playing an instrument that wasn't a lead instrument, and bass was that. Now I've learned to make it a lot more difficult. I've made my job a lot harder than it probably needs to be. But it's just fun. In the beginning my concern was playing in a band.\"\"I took some lessons from a friend of mine when I first started. He was in the school jazz band and he taught me the basics. I didn't take lessons for about a year, but I started again when I was a senior in high school. I've had about four different teachers throughout the years, but I never took lessons for more than a few months. I did, however, gain a lot from them and I've tried to learn as much on my own as I can. Anything I can learn about music or bass playing, I'll try to learn. I mean, the more you learn and the more you apply to your playing, it just makes you a better musician.\"\"I liked the bass player from AC/DC. I really loved the stuff he did. Peter Baltes from Accept was another. I liked the really good guys too, but that seemed out of reach at the beginning. Geddy Lee from Rush and Steve Harris were like gods to me. Billy Sheehan was from Buffalo, and we all knew about Billy before the rest of the country did. Billy has been a legend in Buffalo for a long, long time. He's still one of my favorites. By the time I was listening to Cliff Burton I was getting a little better. I had been playing a year or so before I started listening to Metallica. I thought he was great. I always thought he could have been a little louder on those albums though. That's the thing. In thrash metal or any other kind of metal where the bass is playing exactly what the guitar is playing, automatically the bass went down in the mix. If you notice those older bands like Accept, the bass is doing something that's a little bit different from the guitar. It's more with the kick drum instead of playing the riff the guitar is doing. In thrash metal and then death metal, the bass player always wound up playing what the guitar player was doing most of the time. It's been a decade long fight for us to be heard in the mix.\"\"I'd like to do some instructional material, but I'm still not sure if I'll try and do a DVD or book though. It will probably be easier to do a DVD, actually. Hopefully I'll be able to come up with some stuff that's worth releasing. I definitely won't put anything out until I'm sure it's of really high quality, and full of lots of good information. Also, you might have heard about the possibility of us doing a tab book. Well, we still haven't found a publisher for that.\"\"I practice the most when I have something I'm working on that's difficult, like one of Pat's songs for example. I usually won't practice for more than 3 or 4 hours a day unless I'm really inspired, or I have some kind of deadline.\"\n\nBesides playing bass, Alex has also contributed to lyric and music writing on many occasions for the band, some examples being \"Fucked with a Knife,\" \"Puncture Wound Massacre,\" \"I Will Kill You,\" \"Devoured by Vermin,\" \"Unleashing the Bloodthirsty,\" \"Scavenger consuming death,\" \"Scourge of iron\" and \"Murder Worship\".\nWebster is also known for his bass guitar solos/fills in such songs as \"Addicted to Vaginal Skin\", \"Mangled\", \"The Undead Will Feast\", \"Crushing the Despised\", \"Fucked with a Knife\", \"Hammer Smashed Face\", \"The Discipline of Revenge\", \"Put Them To Death\", \"She Was Asking For It\", \"Staring Through The Eyes of the Dead\", \"Bloodlands\", \"They Deserve to Die\", \"Rabid\", and \"The Strangulation Chair\".\nFrom 2013 to 2015 Webster wrote a monthly tuition column for the UK's Bass Guitar Magazine.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is during this time in Paris that she began researching the social changes in the fur trade amount the Montagnais-Naskapi people. In 1951 Leacock received a grant to conduct fieldwork in Labrador, Canada. During this time she brought her one-year-old son with her to Labrador. She used this fieldwork to challenge the idea that private property is universal.She worked at Bank Street College of Education as a senior research associate, from 1958 to 1965, and at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in the social sciences department, from 1963 to 1972. She struggled to get a full-time job during the 1950s due to her outspoken political views. She taught as an adjunct for decades before being appointed, in 1972, as a professor and chair of anthropology at City College (CCNY) and graduate faculty of City University of New York Graduate Center. Although highly qualified, Leacock credited her CCNY appointment to the rise of the women's movement and social pressure felt by City College to diversify its faculty. Her appointment coincided with the publication of her celebrated introduction to Friedrich Engels' The Origins of the Family, Private Property and the State. In that introduction, she cited contemporary research to further explicate Engels' theory that \"the historic defeat of the female sex\" and subjugation of women began with the stratification of society, the widespread practice of private property, and the emergence of a state.\nIt is not until 1971 that she does her next big fieldwork assignment in Zambia. During this time Zambia had not let many anthropologists into the country because of perceived colonist attitudes. This particular fieldwork aided Leacock in her research of the decolonization efforts in primary school education.One of Leacock's most fruitful contributions to the field of anthropology was her essay entitled \"Interpreting the Origins of Gender Inequality: Conceptual and Historical Problems\" (1983), in which she discussed gender inequalities. Leacock's theories mainly concentrated on the relationships between race, class, gender, sexuality, and religion. And she refuted biological determinism as it relates to race, gender, and class. Leacock's work could be reflected in five areas: women's status in egalitarian societies, race, and gender in schools, culture of poverty studies, women's work in development, and the studies of race, class, and gender in Samoa. Arguing the roles of women in the hierarchical society, she claimed that some features of women become exploitable under the patriarchy system. Leacock interpreted the structure of marriage as the structure of exchange and the division of labor. The exploitation of women's labor within the household is the same.\nLeacock's career involved four major regions: North America, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific. In these areas she studied various topics including the anthropology of education, women cross-culturally, foraging societies, etc.Leacock died of a stroke on April 2, 1987, in Hawaii.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Dowding is best known for his work on \"power\", applying insights from formal analysis to central debates on the nature of power and structure of power in society. Expanding on Brian Barry's concept of \"luck\" (getting what you want without trying) he argues that some groups of people are \"systematically lucky\" in that they are advantaged because of the way society is structured. Such people are not powerful in the sense they have resources that they could use that other groups do not (though they might have this power as well) but rather systematically lucky in that they tend to get what they want without having to do anything. Alternatively, other groups are systematically unlucky. This argument has caused great controversy with critics including Brian Barry, Steven Lukes, Peter Morriss and more recently Andrew Hindmoor.Dowding has also worked on the Tiebout model of individuals moving location to get the local services they require, showing that such moving does occur in the UK though only to a small extent, and that people tend to move to areas for service reasons, but do not decide to leave from areas for those reasons.

At the center, a nurse tells Penny to go out, get high, and come back with \"dirty urine\" to get in. Penny enlists Eli to go see her drug dealer, Sprinkles, for cocaine. While visiting Sprinkles and his companion Black, Eli becomes the translator for Sprinkles and his dealer, Eduardo.\nMeeting Eduardo at a Puerto Rican restaurant, Eli translates what turns into an argument and is shoved to the floor by Eduardo, injuring his right hand, thus putting his audition in jeopardy. In the ensuing car ride, Eli accidentally consumes Penny's oxycodone pills.  Arriving at the school for his audition, Eli runs into Chloe with a group of American Revolutionary War reenactors (whom Sprinkles mistakenly identifies as civil war reenactors), and she helps him prepare. Eli begins to play his piece but fails to finish because of his injured hand and attitude from the pills.\nLeaving the auditorium, embarrassed, Sprinkles shows Eli and Penny the trophy he won for his track record. Sprinkles steals the trophy and he, Eli, Penny, and Black go to pick up Nicole. They drop Nicole off at Penny's sister Trish's, who doesn't like having Penny around because of her drug habit and the fact that she allegedly \"completely ruined last Christmas\". Eli talks Trish into watching Nicole for a couple hours while he, Penny, and his \"colleagues from the supermarket\" go do some stuff.\nThe group returns to the Puerto Rican restaurant to find a party in progress. Sprinkles and Black pick up the drugs while Eduardo dances with Eli's mother. Eli and Sprinkles drink tequila at the bar, and Sprinkles assures Eli he is a musical genius and encourages him to pursue his dream. He also gives Eli the cocaine his mom needs. Eli tells his mom to take the drugs, but she refuses, saying she no longer needs rehab. He calls her a liar and storms out.\nEli runs into the reenactors on the street and reveals his feelings to Chloe. Eli gets a call from his mom and runs to Trish's house to find her hysterical as Trish is hiding Nicole in the bathroom until Penny leaves. Eli chastises Trish, tells Nicole to stop using the puppet, and tells Penny that Nicole can't come home unless she goes to rehab. They agree that Trish will look after Nicole while Eli's mom gets help.\nEli takes Penny back to the rehab clinic and keeps watch while she does the cocaine. She apologizes to Eli and says she wants him to go to the conservatory. She also tells him addiction runs in his genes and he will end up in rehab eventually, then goes to check in. Eli returns to the reenactment area to find Chole. Eli's piano teacher calls him to say that the judges, surprisingly, want him back for another audition the following day. Chloe gives him a hat and character name to join the reenactment, signaling the start of their relationship. The next day Eli plays beautifully at the audition despite his hand injury.", "hasanswer": false}]}
