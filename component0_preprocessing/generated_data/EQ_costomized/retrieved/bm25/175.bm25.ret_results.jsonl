In 2012, Turner told Mojo magazine, \"I met Stacia for the first time at the Isle of Wight...

However, in an interview in Prog Magazine, she said in her first time dancing with the band, at the Flamingo Ballroom in 1971, she asked permission from the band members to dance. She immediately became an integral part of the live show after joining in 1971.\nAccording to a 1974 interview in Penthouse, Stacia was six feet (183 cm) tall and \"happily bisexual\". She regularly augmented her visual impact by performing topless or nude, her body decorated in iridescent or luminescent paint. In a 2007 BBC Four documentary, Lemmy described her as 6 ft 2 inches (188 cm) tall with a 52 inch (132 cm) bust and a bookbinder by trade. The same documentary said that she was working as a petrol pump attendant in Cornwall when she joined the band.Stacia regarded most of what she did with the band as interpretive dance, although there were some set routines. She was an integral part of the early to mid-1970s Hawkwind show, particularly during the Space Ritual era. She left Hawkwind in 1975 after touring with them for the Warrior on the Edge of Time album. It may not have been her decision to leave.

Despite the lack of success of these releases, Bridges came to the attention of Bill Lowery, who became her manager, subsidizing Bridges over a roughly two-year period. During this time, he canvassed record labels on her behalf, which led to her signing with Polydor in 1977.\nBridges's self-titled debut album was the inaugural production by Steve Buckingham, who was assigned to produce Bridges after playing guitar on one of her earliest sessions. Bridges and her personal and songwriting partner Susan Hutcheson had written a song entitled \"Disco 'Round\", which, at Buckingham's suggestion, was recorded as \"I Love the Nightlife\", as Buckingham felt that the song was R&B rather than disco (\"Disco 'Round\" was retained as the song's subtitle): Bridges herself would later admit she had had hopes that the song would be received as a Memphis soul number, calling it \"something Al Green might sing\". However, club support was a key factor in the success of the track, which became a \"sleeper\" Top 40 hit, spending 27 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 with a peak of number five, and also appearing on several international hit parades as evinced by the Billboard's \"Hits of the World\" chart. The song was also in the #5 position on the Record World and Cash Box charts. It was also a \"crossover\" hit, receiving play even on country music stations. The cover of the 1978 self-titled LP features an early skyline picture of Atlanta, Georgia.\nIn 1978, Bridges was a Grammy nominee and was the opening act, performing \"I Love the Nightlife\". Bridges' self-titled LP, Alicia Bridges, was also rising on the Billboard, Cash Box and Record World charts, and the LP remained on the charts for up to 35 weeks. Both the LP and the single release were international successes, and \"I Love the Nightlife\" went top-40 in the UK and Germany, Spain and other European countries. Bridges's music was especially popular in Japan. She received an RIAA Certified Gold Record for the sale of over one million copies of her hit single in the United States, as well as a gold record from Canada.\nContrary to the impression created by her success with \"I Love the Nightlife\", Bridges was primarily a singer of R&B, rock, blues and love songs. \"I Love the Nightlife\" has a definite back beat and organ similar to early 1970s R&B; the original intention was for \"I Love the Nightlife\" to be an R&B song, but when Bill Lowery first heard the song, he saw its disco potential: subsequently, a 12\" single remix was created by Jim Burgess, ultimately becoming a worldwide club smash.\n\"I Love the Nightlife\" has been featured in several movies, including Love at First Bite, The Last Days of Disco and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\nBridges's second single, \"Body Heat\", was a rock song with strong electric guitar rhythms. It was a \"rock/dance\" song released at a time when there was some rivalry between disco fans and rock fans; this time period began to see more songs that mixed the genres of rock and disco to create a \"rock/disco\" flavor.\nIn an interview, Bridges mentioned Elvis Presley as the singer who originally aroused her interest in rock music, but she has always considered herself an R&B singer. She cited Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle as her 1970s influences. She said that she did not care for white female singers as a rule, with the exceptions being Joni Mitchell and Janis Joplin.

Vogel bases the presence of puppets on what she claims is \"one Westerner's misunderstanding of bunraku,\" the centuries-old form of Japanese puppetry. (Vogel does, however, write that other styles of puppets would be acceptable, so long as the children-puppets do not become \"cute or coy.\") Vogel indicates the play's flexibility in regard to the use and number of puppeteers. Some productions, including the world premiere, utilize three-person bunraku teams to manipulate the puppets: an omozukai controls the right hand of the puppet, a hidarizukai controls the left hand of the puppet, and an ashizukai controls the feet. Other productions, sometimes responding to the economic considerations of hiring additional performers, have used a single puppeteer for each child puppet (though this makes it impossible to use traditional bunraku puppets). Regardless of the type of puppeteering arrangement employed, the chief (or in some cases, sole) puppeteer will later assume the role of the child as an adult.\nBoth the 2003 world premiere at the Trinity Repertory Company and subsequent 2004 production at the Long Wharf Theatre featured bunraku puppets created by Basil Twist, a New York-based puppeteer.\nThe traditional bunraku function of the Japanese tay\u016b (or chanter), who, among other narrative tasks, performs a puppet character's utterances, is fulfilled by the Man or Woman narrator at the beginning of the journey and then by a puppeteer (one per child character) in the latter part of the journey. In so doing, Vogel is able to continue the traditional tay\u016b's fluctuation between first-person and second-person address.\nThe Man and Woman, who begin the play as omniscient narrators, soon assume the roles of the mother and father during the journey. These two performers initially speak all stage dialogue, including the lines of the children and some stage directions. Gradually, the three actors who begin the play as the chief puppeteers of the three children begin to speak the children's lines, relegating the Man and Woman to roles as the parents and occasional narrators. The human actors speaking the children's lines during the opening automobile journey abandon the puppets in the latter portion of the play to fully embody the adult characters during lengthy monologues.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is a dense, short album exhibiting wonderful synths, sharp drums, patent Cudi crooning, mumbles and a dreamy atmosphere. Like all of Cudi's music, it pushes the envelope and it's very abstract. There isn't a gray area with Cudder's music, in fact, it is very black and white, meaning people either are going to hate it or love it. But the journey is always an adventure. Satellite Flight captures Cudi's adventure back home to the moon and does it brilliantly.\" Al Horner of NME gave the album an eight out of ten, saying \"Originally meant as an EP, at 10 tracks Satellite Flight is a leaner record than Indicud and all the better for it. Brave and futuristic, by venturing into space, Mescudi finally steps out of Kanye's shadow \u2013 with not just one small step, but one giant leap.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is the primary songwriter and lead singer of his band Cafeine and has also released music under alternate spellings; Caf\u00e9ine, Xavier Caf\u00e9\u00efne, or Caf\u00e9\u00efne. Xavier received formal Jazz-Pop bass training at the C\u00e9gep Marie-Victorin school in Montreal. His first release was the indie-punk album Mal \u00e9duqu\u00e9 mon amour in 1998 sung entirely in French. The follow-up album Pornstar was released in 2000, leaning toward a more glam rock sound, with English lyrics.\n\nIn August 2006, he released Gis\u00e8le on Indica Records as a solo project. Once again Xavier wrote the music, sang and performed most of the instruments on his album. Additional drums were recorded by his friend Michel Langevin of Voivod. Gis\u00e8le considered a classic French-language punk rock album, earning two ADISQ 2007 nominations for \"Best Rock Album of the Year\" and \"Best Male Artist\", and winning the GAMIQ 2007 award for \"Best Rock Album\". The Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada awarded him the \"2008 Discovery of the Year Song\" award for \"La fin du monde\".Cafeine's most recent album New Love was released again on Indica Records in 2013. The album was produced by Gus Van Go, giving the sound a crisper, more modern electro-punk-pop-rock sound. Singles \"New Love\", \"Electric\" and \"L'ettre D'Amour\" each reached the top 15 French-Canadian Commercial Alternative Radio BDS charts. New Love was primarily recorded in English with alternate French language versions for \"Electric\" and \"L'ettre D'Amour\".  On February 17, 2015, New Love was digitally released in the US, marking the first time Cafeine's music received domestic distribution in a territory outside of Canada. The USA album cover art was changed from a photo of Cafeine to a blown out photo of a headless angel. A cover version of The Gun Club's song Sex Beat was included as a bonus track.\nAs a live performer, Cafeine is known for his high-octane-punk intensity. Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec quoted \"he is still a beast on stage\" referencing Toronto's alternative weekly NOW Magazine who declared \"Cafeine is amazing, what a beast on stage\". Established as a beloved personality, Cafeine regularly makes live appearances on French-Canadian music television such as Radio-Canada Television's show Stereopop or MusiquePlus specials such as Pop de jam.In 2007, Belgian singer Plastic Bertrand contacted him to collaborate on the writing and composing of his new album \"Dandy Bandit\". Together they wrote seven songs. The two remain good friends, periodically performing together live as recently as June 24, 2015 in Montreal for the annual St. Jean Baptiste holiday. The free outdoor concert was attended by over 15,000 people in the streets of the Villeray area of Montreal and presented by La fete national dans Villeray 2015.Other producer & songwriting collaborations include two albums for French-Canadian punk band Gazoline, \"Futurbabymama\" (2012) and their self-titled album Gazoline (2014).", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was a prolific composer; there are a great many recordings of all of his music\u2014both popular and classical; and it would be impossible to list all of them.  Indeed, there are new performances and recordings of Rota's music being made to this day.Nino Rota is best known for his many film scores\u2014in particular for the seminal Fellini films La Strada (1954), La Dolce Vita (1960), 8 1/2 (1963), Juliet of the Spirits (1965), and Amarcord (1974). He also wrote the scores for Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968), Luchino Visconti's The Leopard, and Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II.  For Fellini alone, Rota produced almost 80 film scores starting with The White Sheik in 1952 and ending with the unfairly forgotten Orchestra Rehearsal in 1979, the year of the composer's death.\nRota's film scores were a great commercial success.  The soundtrack album of Romeo and Juliet, with combined dialogue and music, reached number two and spent 74 weeks on the Billboard charts. The theme song for La Strada sold more than two million copies in Italy alone.The film scores won many awards. For example, the score for The Godfather was nominated for an Oscar, won a British Academy Film Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Grammy.Less well known is the fact that Rota was a prolific composer of chamber music, operas, and orchestral pieces.

{"id": "175_48", "question": "Who performed The Death of Me?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_39602", "text": "Although the name Jerry Garcia Band only properly applies from late January 1976, this Garcia side-band's actual history and repertoire really began with local club gigs in 1970 featuring Garcia, Merl Saunders, John Kahn and various others, including Tom Fogerty on rhythm guitar (1971-72), Martin Fierro on tenor sax and flute (1974-75), and briefly (October-December 1975) Nicky Hopkins on piano, as well as drummers Bill Kreutzmann, Bill Vitt, Gaylord Birch, and Paul Humphrey.  Garcia and Kahn met in 1970 playing together at Monday jam sessions hosted by Howard Wales at the small San Francisco club, the Matrix.\nOver the years, the lineup of the Jerry Garcia Band changed many times. The one constant member besides Garcia himself was bassist John Kahn, who served as Garcia's principal musical collaborator outside of the Grateful Dead after 1970. Melvin Seals had the next longest tenure, serving as keyboardist from 1981 onward.\nJerry Garcia's musical interests were famously varied, and this was reflected in the diverse music played by his band. Like the Grateful Dead, the Jerry Garcia Band played rock music that was influenced by blues, folk, country, and jazz in an improvisatory milieu that largely served as a framework for Garcia's solos. However, the group eschewed the former band's avant-garde and world music influences in favor of a slower, groove-based \"bar band\" approach strongly oriented toward rhythm and blues (the band often featured female backing vocalists characteristic of the genre), gospel music and reggae. Rock versions of contemporary Americana were also prominent. The relatively languorous tempos were dictated by Garcia and Kahn, much to the chagrin of longtime drummer David Kemper: \"[I]t bothered me from the very beginning. I\u2019d say, \u2018You know we need some uptempo material, it\u2019s just putting me to sleep; the band is putting me to sleep.\u2019 At first I\u2019d say these things, and then I just decided to go with it. It is what it is, and who was I to say anything? This band preceded me; the whole concept of the band preceded me.\"Staples of the band's repertoire included Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland's \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\" (widely perceived as the group's signature song and their most-performed song), Peter Rowan's \"Midnight Moonlight,\" Jimmy Cliff's \"The Harder They Come\" and \"Sitting in Limbo,\" the Sensational Nightingales' \"My Sisters and Brothers,\" Hank Ballard's \"Tore Up Over You,\" Bob McDill and Allen Reynolds' \"Catfish John,\" John Lennon's \"Dear Prudence,\" Jesse Stone's \"Don't Let Go,\" Allen Toussaint's \"I'll Take a Melody\" and \"Get Out of My Life, Woman\", Little Milton's \"That's What Love Will Make You Do,\" Chuck Berry's \"Let It Rock\" and \"You Never Can Tell,\" Bruce Cockburn's \"Waiting for a Miracle,\" Irving Berlin's \"Russian Lullaby,\" Smokey Robinson's \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\" and \"I Second That Emotion,\" Peter Tosh's \"Stop That Train,\" Bob Marley's \"Stir It Up,\" Robbie Robertson's \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\" the Manhattans' \"Shining Star,\" Van Morrison's \"And It Stoned Me\" and \"Bright Side of the Road\" and Norton Buffalo's \"Ain't No Bread in the Breadbox.\" The band also performed Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's \"Ol' Man River\" and Miles Davis' \"So What\" on one occasion apiece. As with the Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia regularly covered many songs by Bob Dylan with the group, including \"Tangled Up in Blue,\" \"Simple Twist of Fate,\" \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" \"Forever Young,\" \"Se\u00f1or (Tales of Yankee Power),\" \"Tears of Rage,\" \"I Shall Be Released,\" \"Tough Mama\" and \"When I Paint My Masterpiece.\"\nThe group did not perform between November 1978 and October 1979; during that year, Garcia, Kahn and keyboardist Merl Saunders (who performed with Garcia and Kahn from 1971 to 1975 in the Saunders/Garcia Band and Legion of Mary) briefly performed in Reconstruction, a more egalitarian jazz-funk ensemble.\nAccording to Linda Kahn in a 2017 Reddit Ask Me Anything prompt, much of the band's repertoire was curated by her husband: \"[H]e did bring most of the cover material to the table. He has a big record collection and they're all in really good shape, he was pretty anal about his records. I think as far as picking songs, he listened to records all the time, so it depends on whoever was in the band and whatever group was playing at the time and that influenced John a lot.\"Although the repertoire was strongly tilted toward covers, several Garcia-Robert Hunter originals (including \"Run for the Roses,\" \"Mission in the Rain,\" \"Gomorrah,\" \"Cats Under the Stars\" and \"Reuben and Cherise\") were performed exclusively or near-exclusively by the Jerry Garcia Band. Some of the band's original repertoire (most notably \"Deal,\" \"They Love Each Other,\" \"Sugaree,\" and \"Friend of the Devil\") was shared with the Grateful Dead.\nDuring Garcia's lifetime, the Jerry Garcia Band released one studio album, Cats Under the Stars, and one live album, Jerry Garcia Band. A number of additional live albums were released posthumously.\nThe group was an indirect beneficiary of the commercial success of the Grateful Dead's  In the Dark (1987); as the latter group transitioned to summer stadium tours and multi-night arena engagements during their autumn and spring tours, the tour itineraries of the Garcia Band (hitherto confined to clubs and small theaters) came to encompass arenas (primarily in Garcia's key northeastern United States market) and outdoor amphitheaters favored by the Grateful Dead in the early 1980s. During this period, the group continued to play as many as fifteen concerts a year in an informal residency at The Warfield, a 2,300-capacity theater in San Francisco. Clarence Clemons also guested with them on tour for a brief time in 1989 and 1990.Kahn briefly led the group (rechristened JGB) following Garcia's death in 1995. Seals became the bandleader after Kahn's death in 1996; as of 2017, he is the only remaining member from the final iteration of the Jerry Garcia Band in JGB.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After receiving his Canadian citizenship, he practiced medicine in the east end of Montreal. He started as a general practitioner in 1955 but increasingly specialized in family planning, becoming one of the first Canadian doctors to perform vasectomies, to insert intra-uterine devices, and to provide birth control pills to unmarried women.On October 17, 1967, he presented a brief on behalf of the Humanist Association of Canada before a House of Commons Health and Welfare Committee that was investigating the issue of illegal abortion. Morgentaler stated that women should have the right to safe abortion. The reaction to his public testimony surprised him: he began to receive calls from women who wanted abortions. Robert Malcolm Campbell and Leslie Alexander Pal wrote, \"Henry Morgentaler experienced the [abortion] law's limitations directly in the supplications of desperate women who visited his Montreal office.\" Morgentaler's initial response was to refuse:\n\n\"I hadn't expected the avalanche of requests and didn't realize the magnitude of the problem in immediate, human terms. I answered, 'I sympathize with you. I know your problem, but the law won't let me help you. If I do help you, I'll go to jail, I lose my practice\u2014I have a wife and two children. I'm sorry, but I just can't!'\"\nFor a time he was able to refer the women to two other doctors who did abortions, but they became unavailable. There was no one to whom he could send them, and some of them were ending up in the emergency department after amateur abortions. He has said that he felt like a coward for sending them away and that he was shirking his responsibility. Eventually, in spite of the risks to himself\u2014loss of career, a prison term for years or for life\u2014he decided to perform abortions and, at the same time, challenge the law. He knew from other doctors and from newspaper reports that women in Montreal had died from incompetently performed abortions. He knew that the women were determined to get abortions in spite of the danger to their health and lives. He knew that he could prevent those unnecessary deaths, so he determined to use civil disobedience to change the law.In 1968, Morgentaler gave up his family practice and began performing abortions in his private clinic. He devoted his clinic to performing abortions on women as well as providing birth control and contraceptives, though it was illegal at the time. At the time, abortion was illegal except for cases in which continuing a pregnancy threatened the life of the pregnant woman. On August 26, 1969, an amendment to the Criminal Code legalized abortion in Canada if performed in a hospital after approval of a Therapeutic Abortion Committee. There was, however, no requirement for a hospital to set up a committee and only about one-third of hospitals did. This left many areas without legal abortion, forcing women to travel and inducing barriers and delays. Some committees never met. Even if they did, they never saw their \"patient\" and yet her fate was determined by their subjective opinions. In addition, there was no appeal of a TAC's decision. Morgentaler's abortions remained illegal under the new law because he did not submit them in advance to a TAC for approval; they became legal in 1988, when section 251 of the Criminal Code (now known as section 287) was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada.\nIn 1983, Morgentaler debated former abortion doctor Bernard Nathanson for an hour on a Canadian national superstation.After Quebec stopped prosecuting him in 1976, Morgentaler opened an abortion clinic in Ontario. In spite of prosecutions, other provinces followed. In 2003, he was able to close his Halifax clinics because a doctor that he trained was now performing abortions at a local hospital, QEII Health Sciences Centre.In 2006, Morgentaler had to stop performing abortions after undergoing a heart bypass surgery.

To help promote her first fragrance, Black Star, Lavigne needed a short theme that would be used for the TV spots. \"Black Star\" was composed in a Malaysian hotel during her tour. The jingle was eventually expanded into a short introduction to the album. Recording began with minimal instruments, usually starting with Lavigne singing only to acoustic guitar, with additional instruments added later. Lavigne stated that her vocals were the most important instrument to her during the album's recording, \"Typically the lead vocal gets buried in the track and you can't always hear the quality, character, or emotion after a certain point. I wanted my voice to be the main instrument.\"Lavigne described the process: \"It's stripped down. I love performing that way, so I really felt like it was time to make a record like that. To just make it all about the vocal and the performance, and the vibe, and the emotion.\" Because she has a studio in her home, Lavigne was able to compose and record at her leisure. She also used the piano to compose the majority of the songs. \"The piano is more of an emotional instrument. It stirs up different emotions for me and moves me in a different way than the guitar can.\" By July 2009, nine tracks had been recorded, including the songs \"Fine\", \"Everybody Hurts\" and \"Darlin'\", the latter being the second song Lavigne wrote as a 15-year-old while living in Napanee, Ontario. Lavigne stated that this album would be different from her previous work, \"The other albums I've done, the songs are all over the place. This is the most consistent album all the way through.\"In addition to working with Deryck Whibley in the majority of the songs, Lavigne also produced two songs on her own and worked with Max Martin and Shellback. \"What was really great about working with Max was, I flew out to Sweden for a couple weeks, sat down, played him my record, got to know each other, wrote some songs together, and then I was out,\" she told MTV News. \"It switched it up for me. It was a new creative space, a new relationship, and we got a lot done. He's very talented.\" Lavigne's longtime collaborators Evan Taubenfield and Butch Walker co-wrote and produced some of the tracks as well. In November 2010, British producer Alex da Kid, who worked with Lavigne beginning in August 2010, stated that some songs on the album will have a hip-hop sound, \"We've got some things that are hip-hop leaning, and we've got some things that are more pop/rock leaning\". In December, it was announced that the songs produced by Alex da Kid would not be on the album but Lavigne stated, \"we're gonna do something with that stuff, I'm just not sure what yet\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Lastly, Tower House was named after the Tower of Jezreels (for boys from Gillingham High Street and Chatham Hill and whose colours were to be green and white). Boys were told to group themselves so as to get some idea of the numbers in each house and to appoint officers.At the start of the Second World War, the School had disbanded the House System. In Autumn 1945, new interest had been added that year to all forms of athletic sports by the revival of the House System. There were now four Houses instead of five Houses; Bridge, Castle, Gordon and Pitt. Tower House no longer existed. The Old Tower House included almost entirely boys from Gillingham and Rainham, and very few boys from those districts attended the school. The Houses no longer contained boys from definite areas; the arrangement for drafting boys to the various Houses ensured that any group of four new boys one should be allotted to each House, although the rule was modified in the case of brothers and of sons of former members of the School Houses. As there were likely to be few such sons, and as four Houses were easier to deal with than five, it was thought not desirable to revive Tower House.When the House System was created, the original Houses had different colours from today. Bridge changed from black and white to green. Castle changed from black and red to red. Gordon changed from blue and white to dark blue. And finally, Pitt changed from red and white to Yellow. When this change happened is not confirmed.\nMore recently, River House was created in 1993 (named after the River Medway, and whose colours were to be purple) and Thetford House in 1996 (named after the sister school in Norfolk, and whose colours were to be light blue).

However, once Consort Ding was buried, a Taoist monk informed Xiao Tong that he believed that the land would bring ill fortune for Consort Ding's oldest son\u2014Xiao Tong.  Xiao Tong therefore allowed the monk to bury a few items intended to dissolve the ill fortune, such as wax gooses, at the position reserved for the oldest son.

When Emperor Wu investigated, waxed gooses were found, and Emperor Wu became surprised and angry, and wanted to investigate further.  He only stopped the investigation when he was advised to do so by the prime minister Xu Mian, executing only the Taoist monk who had suggested the burial of wax gooses.  Xiao Tong became humiliated in the affair, and was never able to clear himself completely in his father's eyes.\nXiao Tong died in 531.  Even when he was very ill, because he was afraid to make Emperor Wu be concerned about him, he still personally wrote submissions to his father.  After his death, Emperor Wu personally attended his wake and buried him at a tomb appropriate for an emperor.

For the first time in her career, Madonna co-wrote and co-produced all of the album's tracks. According to Leonard, she was \"very much in love\" and in control when creating the record. The singer worked with Bray and Leonard separately, with the three meeting together only once. Leonard recalled the recording process: \"I would put something together, usually just on piano, and then [Madonna] would come in, we'd mess around with whatever needed to be messed around with, she\u2019d write a lyric, she\u2019d sing it, and the next day we would do another song, one a day\". On the other hand, Bray's job was to \"shape things and [...] create arrangements to show off the song[s] better\".  \"Open Your Heart\" was the first track recorded for the album; it was created as a rock and roll song titled \"Follow Your Heart\" by Gardner Cole and Peter Rafelson for singer Cyndi Lauper. Madonna's team got a demo with songs from Cole's management, among them \"Follow Your Heart\"; she liked the track, changed the title, re-wrote some of the lyrics, and produced it alongside Leonard. They added a bassline underneath, changing it from a rock song into a dance one.\"Papa Don't Preach\" was written by Brian Elliott for a singer named Cristina Dent. When Elliot played Dent's tracks for Warner's Michael Ostin, the same A&R executive who discovered \"Like a Virgin\", Ostin asked if he could play the track for Madonna; Elliot had been working with Dent for six months and was reluctant to let the song go to another artist, but he eventually gave in, finding the idea of Madonna recording his song \"hard to resist\". With lyrics that talk about teenage pregnancy, Madonna was attracted to the track because it \"fit right in with my own personal zeitgeist of standing up to male authorities\". She only contributed with additional lyrics, making \"Papa Don't Preach\" the only song on the album that she did not have a strong hand in writing. \"La Isla Bonita\" marked a \"stylistic shift\" for Madonna, as it's her first song to incorporate Latin motifs, and lyrics in Spanish.  It was created by Leonard as an instrumental and offered to Michael Jackson, who turned it down. After meeting with the singer to start working on True Blue, Leonard presented her the demo and she wrote the lyrics while filming Shanghai Surprise. To get the correct translations, he and Madonna talked over the phone with a Hispanic housekeeper. It was described as a tribute to \"the beauty and mystery of Latin American people\". \"Where's the Party\" is the only track that saw Madonna, Bray and Leonard working together. Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens-Crowder, the authors of Madonna's 1983 hit \"Holiday\", wrote a song called \"Spotlight\" for the album, that was recorded but ultimately not included. Madonna dedicated True Blue to Penn, \"the coolest guy in the universe\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The band got the idea for using radio interference while rewriting then in-progress songs on Centipede Hz for a live performance at the 2011 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

Gaga sang on a pink Steinway & Sons piano decorated with painted-on butterflies. The performance included ballet dancers from the Bolshoi Theatre as part of \"The Shortest Musical You Will Never See Again\", an art piece directed by Francesco Vezzoli. At the 2009 American Music Awards, Gaga performed \"Speechless\" alongside \"Bad Romance\" from The Fame Monster. She wore a flesh-colored bodysuit adorned with white piping, simulating ribs and a spine with embedded flashing lights. Starting with \"Bad Romance\", she transitioned into \"Speechless\" by breaking open a glass box containing a piano with her microphone stand. Seated on the piano bench, she set the instrument on fire and continued the performance, smashing liquor bottles on it throughout. Gaga performed the two songs again at The Ellen DeGeneres Show on November 25, 2009. She sang \"Speechless\" at the Royal Variety Performance, which was attended by Queen Elizabeth II. Wearing a red latex dress inspired by the Elizabethan era, Gaga played a piano suspended ten feet in the air that was supported by stilts.\nOn December 8, 2009, Gaga performed the song live at the launch party of Vevo in New York City. She played the piano while sporting a large platinum blonde hair bow. Billboard praised Gaga for showcasing emotional depth through her vocals and facial expressions. \"Speechless\" was on the setlist of Gaga's Monster Ball Tour (2009\u20132011). During the original version of the concert series, \"Speechless\" came after an acoustic version of \"Poker Face\". Jane Stevenson from Toronto Star called the \"Speechless\" performance the \"emotional high point\" of the show. In the revamped Monster Ball shows, Gaga dressed in bra and knickers and performed the song on a flaming piano.Gaga was the opening performer of the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010. She appeared in a green outfit with glittery shoulder pads. After performing \"Poker Face\", she was thrown into a flaming bin with the word \"Rejected\" written on it. Covered in ashes, she reemerged on stage seconds later, joined by Elton John. They sat at opposite sides of a double piano and sang \"Speechless\" as a medley with John's \"Your Song\". In 2018, Ashley Laderer from Billboard named it Gaga's eleventh best live performance, calling it \"heartfelt\". In April 2010, Gaga held a mini-concert in Japan for MAC Cosmetics, collaborating with the Canadian performance artist, Terence Koh. Billed as \"GagaKoh\", the concert took place on a rotating stage where Koh had created a statue of a naked woman with rabbit ears. \"Speechless\" was one of the three songs Gaga performed at the event, besides \"Bad Romance\" and \"Alejandro\". In May 2011, Gaga performed a jazz version of the song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria.In April 2017, Gaga performed \"Speechless\" on the piano during both weekends of the Coachella Festival, where she was one of the headliners. On the second show, she included a snippet of \"Bad Romance\" into her performance of \"Speechless\".In 2019, American singer King Princess covered \"Speechless\" for BBC Radio 1 as part of the station's Piano Sessions.

The film adaptation was a blockbuster worldwide, but it ran for only three days in Salzburg movie theaters, with locals showing \"disdain\" for a film that \"wasn't authentic.\" In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg. Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region. The Salzburg tourism industry took advantage of the attention from foreign tourists, although residents of the city were apathetic about \"everything that is dubious about tourism.\" The guides on the bus tour \"seem to have little idea of what really happened on the set.\" Even the ticket agent for the Sound of Music Dinner Show tried to dissuade Austrians from attending a performance that was intended for American tourists, saying that it \"does not have anything to do with the real Austria.\" By 2007, The Sound of Music was drawing 300,000 visitors a year to Salzburg, more than the city's self-conception as the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A German translation of the musical was performed on the national stage for the first time in 2005 at the Vienna Volksoper, receiving negative reviews from Austrian critics, who called it \"boring\" and referred to \"Edelweiss\" as \"an insult to Austrian musical creation.\" The musical finally premiered in Salzburg in 2011 at the Salzburger Landestheater, but Maria was played in the Salzburg premiere by a Dutch actress who \"grew up with the songs.\" However, most performances in Vienna and Salzburg were sold out, and the musical is now in both companies' repertoire.\nA Sing-along Sound of Music revival screening was first shown at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1999, leading to a successful run at the Prince Charles Cinema which was ongoing as of 2018. During the screenings, audience members are often dressed as nuns and von Trapp children and are encouraged to sing along to lyrics superimposed on the screen.

Ashramavasa Parva (Chapters: 1\u201328)\nThis sub-book describes the fifteen year reign by Yudhishthira after the great war, followed by the departure of Kunti, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari to Vyasa's hermitage for sannyasa. It also mentions Vidura and his death.2. Putradarsana Parva (Chapters: 29\u201336)\nThis sub-book recites the visit of Pandavas to meet Kunti, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari at the hermitage. In the forest on the request of Gandhari, Kunti & other women, sage Vyasa with his powers, resurrect the dead warriors of Kurukshetra war for one night.3. Naradagamana Parva (Chapters: 37\u201339)\nThis sub-book describes the death of Kunti, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari. Narada visits to console those in grief. Yudhishthira performs cremation rites for all of them.The parva describes the 15 year rule by Pandavas with Yudhishthira as the king. Yudhishthira commanded his brothers to cause no grief to Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, who had lost all their hundred sons. Bhima alone however could not forgive the evil that his cousins had done, and his servitors disregarded Dhritarashtra's wishes. Once, the angry Vrikodara harshly reminded the old man how he had dispatched all his mighty sons to the other worlds. Hearing these words, Dhritarashtra gave way to cheerlessness and sorrow. After fifteen years Dhritarashtra and his wife sought the king's permission to take sannyasa (renunciation of domestic life for moksha). Yudhishthira initially disagreed but was persuaded otherwise by Vyasa. \nBefore leaving for the forest Dhritarashtra dispatched Vidura to the king, asking for the means to perform a \u015br\u0101ddha for the deceased Kurus. While Yudhishthira and Arjuna accepted the request, Bhima was enraged. Following the performance of the rites, Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti left for the forest. Sanjaya and Vidura joined them in Vyasa's hermitage. \nOne year later the Pandavas went to meet with them. On seeking Vidura, Yudhishthira found him performing rigorous tapasya deep in the forest; without his uttering a word,  energy left Vidura's body and entered that of Yudhishthira, after which Vidura fell dead. When he tried to cremate the corpse an invisible voice prevented the king from doing so. Vyasa then told him how Vidura was an incarnation of Dharma, the god of righteousness, born in the mortal world through the curse of Mandavya. \nVyasa understanding the sorrow of Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti offered them a glimpse of their sons and relatives who died at Kurukshetra. The  spirits of the slain then rose from the waters of the Bhagirathi, with Vyasa offering the blind Dhritarashtra celestial vision for beholding those heroes. The five Pandavas met Karna, Abhimanyu, and the sons of Draupadi. After some time that large ghostly host disappeared and went to their respective regions. \nOn hearing the story the sceptical Janamejaya asked Vyasa to prove the veracity of the tale, upon which Vyasa summoned Parikshit. The Pandavas, at Dhritarashtra's own request, then returned to Hastinapura.\nTwo years later, Narada informed Yudhishthira that Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti had willingly perished in a forest-fire, after ordering Sanjaya to escape.

That month, while Houston was on her first headlining world tour, The Greatest Love World Tour, Arista head Clive Davis began preparing songs for Houston's sophomore release. Following the global crossover success of \"How Will I Know\" produced by Narada Michael Walden, Davis handpicked him to be the primary producer of the second album. During the summer, Houston began recording with Walden with material Davis had previewed for the singer in demo recordings, including \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\". Though Davis wanted Houston to have a younger, accessible sound, Davis agreed to continue the previous album's use of ballads.\nComposer and lyricist Frank Wildhorn, who later conceived the Broadway musical, Jekyll & Hyde, had wanted to write a song for Houston after hearing her duet with Teddy Pendergrass, \"Hold Me\", a couple of years earlier. He and songwriter Chuck Jackson were eventually hired by Davis to compose a ballad for the singer. According to Wildhorn, Jackson, known for writing hit songs such as \"This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)\" and \"I've Got Love on My Mind\" for Natalie Cole, called him on the phone and gave him the title. From there, he said, he \"sat there at the piano... and in about 40 minutes, 90% of the sketch of the song was done\". Afterwards, he called Jackson back and told him to come over his house because \"I think we've got something\" and the duo finished the song later that night.\nAfter presenting the song to Davis, Wildhorn recalled the song's selection for the album:\"From what I understand, it was one of the first songs chosen for the album. Knowing [it was for] Whitney's project, there must have been 50,000 songs submitted after (ours). So every week it was, 'Do we still have it?' We were going through hell.\"\nAlong with \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" and \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\", it was one of the earliest songs presented for Houston's sophomore effort. Prior to her recording the song, other singers, such as Smokey Robinson, offered to record it but Wildhorn and Jackson refused, holding out hope for Houston to record it.When Houston eventually listened to a demo record of the ballad, the singer flatly turned it down, thinking the song \"had no depth to it\". Years later, in a 2000 interview, Houston admitted, \"I didn't even wanna do '[Where Do] Broken Hearts [Go]', I hated the song, I didn't wanna sing it\". However, Davis insisted the song would be perfect for Houston to sing because, he told her, \"this is your number one song\". Houston said she eventually found \"some meaning in [the song] that I could relate to\" when she entered the studio with Walden producing the session.Once Houston started recording, Wildhorn recalls being struck by her performance:\n\n\u201cI cried the first time I heard Whitney sing \u2018Where Do Broken Hearts Go.\u2019 I've had Julie Andrews, Liza Minnelli, Johnny Mathis, Trisha Yearwood and Patti LaBelle (sing songs I've written), but if someone put a gun to my head, the answer is Whitney's version of \u2018Where do Broken Hearts go,\u2019 going No. 1, that's as good as it gets.\u201d", "hasanswer": false}]}

At first, the parents are relieved that they can now use the phone and the bath tub but, as the hours pass, they get increasingly nervous. Meanwhile their offspring  frug to the songs of Petula Clark while they are downtown. Eventually, the parents take Miltown in order to calm themselves down. However the father gets a phone call telling him that their children have been arrested as the result of a car accident, prompting him to angrily borrow someone else's car to get his sons home. He then vows to ground the teenagers and go downtown with his wife, where he promises to do \"very nice dances\" including the tango, waltz, foxtrot, and bunny hop, instead of the dances of the younger generation such as the Frug, the Swim, the Mashed Potato or the Jerk.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

When first exhibited, it received enthusiastic reviews for its unsentimental depiction of lower-class laborers, which stood in stark contrast to the romanticised, classical or propagandist nature of most contemporary Russian art. The painting paved the way for Repin to join the Peredvizhniki (the Wanderers or Itinerants), an anti-academic realist movement formed in 1870. The Peredvizhniki sought not only to break away from the academic school, but also to subvert the manner in which art was viewed. By depicting scenes from ordinary life and holding exhibitions in the provinces they aimed to enlighten and make art more accessible to the masses.The painting was widely discussed for its break with the traditions of the academy. It earned Repin the respect of Vladimir Stasov who believed that art shaped people's outlook and the way in which they viewed their own political situation. Stasov encouraged Repin to focus on Russian subject matter and after the release of Barge Haulers, he became a close friend of the artist and enthusiastically praised each of Repin's paintings thereafter. Stasov wrote of the painting, \"with a daring that is unprecedented amongst us [Repin] has abandoned all former conceptions of the ideal in art, and has plunged head first into the very heart of the people's life, the people's interests, and the people's oppressive reality ... no one in Russia has ever dared take on such a subject\".  In return, Repin said that Stasov's \"cry all over Russia was the first and the mightiest and it was heard in Russia by everyone capable of hearing. It was thanks to him that my glory spread.\"\nFyodor Dostoyevsky read about Repin's painting in the newspapers and assumed it was another Russian work whose artistry was secondary to its social message. He wrote, \"Even the subject itself is terrible ... I came expecting to see these barge-haulers all lined up in uniforms with the usual labels stuck to their foreheads ... To my delight, all my fears turned out to be in vain ... Not a single one of them shouts from the painting to the viewer, 'Look how unfortunate I am and how indebted you are to the people!'\" To Dostoyevsky, Repin had avoided a common fault of contemporary Russian art, and in doing so had heightened the work's impact. He concluded, \"[I saw] barge haulers, real barge haulers, and nothing more ... you can't help but think you are indebted, truly indebted, to the people.\" Such a feeling of an \"unpaid debt\" owed by the higher society to the peasantry was a common idea of the Narodniks. Today the painting is regarded as seminal in the formation of Russian realism.The painting has been criticised both for still bearing hallmarks of academic drawing and for having an overall yellowish tone. Although it won a prize at the Society for the Advancement of the Arts in 1872, Repin continued to rework the canvas until 1873 when it was exhibited at the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.The painting has been widely parodied, and it is often used as the basis for satirical political cartoons in Russia and elsewhere. A Finnish political cartoon by Kari Suomalainen created an international hubbub in 1958 for showing Nikita Khrushchev on a barge pulled by Eastern bloc countries shouting \"Imperialists!\" to the US and UK on the shore.According to the art critic Elia Kabanov, Repin's painting influenced American orientalist painter Frederick Arthur Bridgman to produce his Towing on the Nile in 1875.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Discussing the Star Trek motion pictures, the Associated Press noted that Star Trek films were measured by how menacing their foe was, and that Khan was among the best in the series; a 2002 review of the Star Trek films ranked Khan as the greatest enemy seen in any of the films. Reviewers of The Wrath of Khan, such as Roger Ebert, rated Khan as one of the strongest aspects of the film. New Yorker critic Pauline Kael said Montalb\u00e1n's performance \"was the only validation he has ever had of his power to command the big screen.\"Critic Christopher Null notes that \"it is nearly gospel now among Trekkies that... Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is the undisputed best of the series, and will likely never meet its equal,\" and calls Khan the \"greatest role of [Montalb\u00e1n's] career\". Though he felt that the villain of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, V'Ger, was more cerebral and interesting, author James Iaccino notes that most fans and moviegoers preferred the archetypical good-versus-evil fight that the struggle between Khan and Kirk represents. Villains in subsequent Star Trek films have been measured by the standard of Khan, with Paramount promising fans that the villain of Star Trek Generations would be equal to the genetic superman. IGN ranked Khan as the best Star Trek villain, noting that he set the pattern for revenge-seeking villains in the series; in the decades since the film's release, \"even those with a passing interest [in Trek] know the name.\"Star Trek producer Rick Berman called the villain \"threatening and memorable.\"Khan is also recognized as a great villain outside of the Star Trek series. The Associated Press called the character \"one of sci-fi's great villains\". In 2002, the Online Film Critics Society's 132 members voted Khan as the 10th-greatest screen villain of all time, the only Star Trek character to appear in the listing. In 2006, Emmy Magazine voted Khan \"TV's Most Out-of-This-World Character\", beating out other science fiction characters such as the Doctor and Commander Adama. Editors wrote that \"Khan was so cool we would've bought a Chrysler Cordoba if he'd told us to,\" alluding to an ad campaign Montalb\u00e1n appeared in for Chrysler. The character also had a cultural impact outside of Star Trek fandom; a clip from The Wrath of Khan featuring Kirk screaming \"Khaaan!\" was one popular culture appropriation that became a \"popular fad\" driving the success of the website YTMND.In 2004, the Star Trek franchise returned to Khan's backstory in a three-episode story arc on Star Trek: Enterprise. In \"Borderland\", \"Cold Station 12\" and \"The Augments\", a 22nd-century scientist is portrayed as having revived genetically engineered embryos from Khan's time and raised them as \"Augments\". Enterprise producer Manny Coto described these characters as \"mini Khan Noonien Singhs\". A descendant of Khan, La'an Noonien-Singh, appears in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds; in the time-traveling episode \"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\", Khan appears as a child played by Desmond Sivan.Benedict Cumberbatch's performance in Star Trek Into Darkness drew praise from critics with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine calling it a \"tour-de-force to be reckoned with\" and his character \"a villain for the ages\". Joe Neumaier of New York's Daily News wrote that Cumberbatch delivered \"one of the best blockbuster villains in recent memory\". Jonathan Romney of The Independent specifically noted Cumberbatch's voice saying it was \"So sepulchrally resonant that it could have been synthesised from the combined timbres of Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Alan Rickman holding an elocution contest down a well.\" The New York Times praised his screen presence saying \"He fuses Byronic charisma with an impatient, imperious intelligence that seems to raise the ambient I.Q. whenever he's on screen.\"Christian Blauvelt from website Hollywood.com criticized the casting of Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness as being \"whitewashed into oblivion\". Star Trek: Voyager actor Garrett Wang tweeting, \"The casting of Cumberbatch was a mistake on the part of the producers. I am not being critical of the actor or his talent, just the casting.\"\nCo-producer and co-screenwriter Roberto Orci addressed the issue of the casting:Basically, as we went through the casting process and we began honing in on the themes of the movie, it became uncomfortable for me to support demonizing anyone of color, particularly any one of Middle Eastern descent or anyone evoking that. One of the points of the movie is that we must be careful about the villain within us, not some other race.\nIn 2016, ScreenRant rated Khan as the 6th-best character in Star Trek overall.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This magnificent, sad masterpiece about race, history, and defeated dreams can easily stand comparison with Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men. Little wonder, too, that parts of the story of E.J. Watson call up comparisons with Dostoevsky, Conrad, and, inevitably, Faulkner. In every way, Shadow Country is a bravura performance, at once history, fiction, and myth\u2014as well as the capstone to the career of one of the most admired and admirable writers of our time.\nTom LeClair, reviewing the work for the New York Times, considered that the work failed to live up to the sum total of its originally published parts, stating:\n\nBy reducing his Watson materials to one volume, Matthiessen has sacrificed qualities that gave those novels their powerful reinforcing illusions of authenticity and artlessness. Book I still has that Ten Thousand Islands quality, but \"Shadow Country\" as a whole is like the Tamiami Trail that crosses the Everglades. It offers a quicker and easier passage through the swamp, but fewer shades and shadows.\nTampa Bay Times book editor Colette Bancroft praised the book's wider theme and context:\n\nMatthiessen is writing about one man's life in Shadow Country, but he is also writing about the life of the nation over the course of half a century. Watson's story is essentially the story of the American frontier, of the conquering of wild lands and people, and of what such empires cost. Most of the book is set in frontier Florida, a Florida virtually unimaginable in our air-conditioned, subdivided century. It is a brutally beautiful wilderness where, just 100 years ago, panthers and red wolves stalked the woods, plume hunters made fortunes wiping out whole species of birds and men like Watson made their own law.\nShadow Country takes us there in unforgettable fashion. Even among a body of work as magnificent as Matthiessen's, this is his great book.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Nash apparently referred specifically to \"Ah! Sun-flower\" and felt an affinity with what he thought was the Sunflower's seemingly imminent death (like his own).Allen Ginsberg was one of the poets who admired this poem. In 1948 he had the hallucinatory experience of hearing Blake reading \"Ah, Sun-flower\" and two other works (see Allen Ginsberg: the Blake vision). Ginsberg wrote his own \"Sunflower sutra\" in 1955, descriptive, perhaps, of love persisting amidst moral and physical devastation. He also regularly performed readings of the poem.\nAs befits a song, there have been many musical settings of \"Ah! Sun-flower\". The following are the most notable.\nRalph Vaughan Williams included \"Ah! Sun-flower\" in his 1958 song cycle Ten Blake Songs.\nBenjamin Britten's song cycle Songs and Proverbs of William Blake (1965) includes a setting of \"Ah! Sun-flower\".\nEd Sanders of The Fugs set the poem to music and recorded it on The Fugs First Album in 1965.\nFor the passing of the 2nd millennium, British composer Jonathan Dove set the text of \"Ah, Sun-flower\" and two other poems by Blake (\"Invocation\" and \"The Narrow Bud Opens Her Beauties To The Sun\") in his piece The Passing of the Year (2000), a song cycle for double chorus and piano.\nIn 2002, the Canadian sisters Kate and Anna McGarrigle wanted to record Ed Sanders' setting in French; they asked Philippe Tatartcheff to translate the poem, only to find the words no longer scanned with the tune.

In October 2022, 25 years after its original release, BMG released the album for the first time on vinyl. Using its original title Impossible Princess, the 25th Anniversary edition was reissued with three different coloured wax pressings and a limited edition Picture Disc variant.Because of constant delays in 1997, Mushroom Records premiered six of the album tracks\u2014\"Some Kind of Bliss\", \"Too Far\", \"Say Hey\", \"Limbo\", \"I Don't Need Anyone\", and \"Did It Again\"\u2014on a special sample compact disc in Australia. Deconstruction conducted a similar promotional campaign in Europe and distributed six different songs on a sample cassette tape. Live and Other Sides was released accompanied by Australian releases of the album at HMV in 1998, with two unreleased Impossible Princess tracks, one unreleased Kylie Minogue track, and three live tracks. Another EP, Other Sides, featured the two B-sides, \"Love Takes Over Me\" and \"Tears\" and an unreleased Impossible Princess track, \"Take Me with You\". Minogue's fourth remix album, Mixes, includes singles from the album; it was released in the UK in August 1998. In Australia, the remix album was replaced by Impossible Remixes, featuring the previously unreleased \"Breathe (TNT Club Mix)\". Several album tracks and three unreleased tracks from Impossible Princess appear on Hits+ (2000) released in Europe.", "hasanswer": false}]}

One of the titles was even a verse from \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d - \"The Riot Be the Rhyme of the Unheard\". Tom Morello eventually used the name \"Battle Hymns\" for a track on his debut album, One Man Revolution in 2007.\n\"Calm Like a Bomb\" is notable as a display of guitarist Tom Morello's creative use of a whammy pedal. Like many of RATM's songs, the song's lyrics take a radical and violent approach to the topic of social inequalities. The song also features a reference to Emiliano Zapata. Tim Commerford uses a combination of a home-made overdrive pedal and the Jim Dunlop 105Q Bass Wah pedal on his bass throughout the song. In Rolling Stone magazine's feature article on the new \"Guitar Heroes,\" a section was printed about Tom Morello, and \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d was cited as the prime example of his skill and fame on the guitar. He has occasionally referred to the extremely high whammy-pedal effects used in songs such as this as \"pterodactyl sounds.\"\n\"Calm Like a Bomb\" made its live debut on June 11, 1999, at the K-Rock Dysfunctional Family Picnic in Wantagh, New York at Jones Beach Amphitheater.\nIt was prominently featured in the ending credits of The Matrix Reloaded and was also included in the film's soundtrack.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Madonna wore a Versace Spring/Summer 1995 silver silk evening dress, with long blonde extensions. She even invited Bj\u00f6rk to feature in the performance; the singer turned it down, saying \"I was supposed to get [Madonna's] personal number and call her up, but it just didn't feel right. I'd love to meet her accidentally, really drunk in a bar. It's just all that formality that confuses me\". It was described by Music Week as a \"flamboyant performance\". The performance was ranked number four on Marie Claire's \"30 Best Brit Award Moments\" list. It was described by the magazine as the \"best opening performance\" at the Brits. A writer described that \"[Madonna] pulled out all the stops, treating the audience to a light show and trio of satin-clad male dancers\".Madonna included the song on her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, where elements of the Orbital remix were used as a video interlude. As the video played, three acrobatic dancers dropped from the ceiling on swings in a Cirque du Soleil-like performance. Madonna appeared in the video wearing a white costume while singing in front of a mirror and lying down on a big scanner. A white horse can be seen with her during the video riding on a white desert and running through white sheets. As the interlude ended, Madonna appeared on stage again to sing \"Nothing Fails\" (2003). Glenn Gamboa of Newsday commented that the \"athletic swinging\" of the trapeze artists during the interlude \"provides the song a grace that it never would have seen in a straight performance\", while Anthony J. Sanfilippo, editor of the Delaware County Daily Times, stated that \"three trapeze artists who undulated in perfect synchronicity while dangerously flying out over the audience\".Madonna later included \"Bedtime Story\" in the setlist for her 2023\u201324 The Celebration Tour. The performance features the singer wearing a mirror ball body suit, on a giant cube that rises out of the stage. The cube's screen show images of an anime-inspired Madonna in an animated world \"accessing dreamlike meanders, full of creatures, rituals, possibilities that we can't explain\", created by Brazilian artist Gabriel Massan. It was named one of the best moments of the concert by Billboard's Joe Lynch, who wrote that she \"sounded fabolous\" during the number. The BBC's Mark Savage included it as one of the \"not so successful\" moments, and stated that the performance \"felt superfluous\".\"Bedtime Story\" has been cited as one of the songs with the most unfulfilled potential in Madonna's career; nonetheless, the song did enjoy some success, being a club \"favorite\" in the mid-1990s. It has been described as the record that foreshadowed Madonna's usage of electronic music in her later work, especially Ray of Light (1998), which according to Vicente, owes \"its contemplative and electronic techno rave character to 'Bedtime Story'.\" O'Brien wrote in Madonna: Like an Icon, that the song \"foreshadowed [the singer's] move towards electronica\". De Vries recalled that tackling the song \"seemed to set something free in Madonna. She was straining at the leash a little bit, to find some other languages to speak, and 'Bedtime Story' was an embryonic moment that went a lot further on to the next few albums.\" In a review for the Bedtime Stories album on a whole, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the song was \"the germ that would later inspire Madonna to seek out and conquer electronica with the likes of William Orbit and Mirwais\". While ranking Madonna's 60 best singles, Chuck Arnold from Entertainment Weekly listed \"Bedtime Story\" at 54, calling it an \"important\" song in the singer's catalogue as, according to the author, it provided a \"jumping-off point for the avant-garde electronica of Ray of Light\". Arca stated: \"This song in particular and its video hit me hard and then stroked me soft, presented an infrastructure of widescreen unapologeticness so empowering that to this day, when the song starts, I smile from ear to ear and want to lick my own skin\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the collapsing ruins of the White House, U.S. President Gerald Fitzhugh (Louis Gossett Jr.) videotapes a confession. He looks out the window as a shadowy figure arrives in the doorway.\nOne week earlier, the Tribulation Force, consisting of Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson), his daughter Chloe (Janaya Stephens), Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron), Bruce Barnes (Arnold Pinnock), and Chris Smith are in the process of stealing Bibles from a Global Community (GC) compound. Guards burst into the warehouse and are handily defeated by Chris (using kung fu) while the remaining Trib Force members escape. In Washington, D.C., the President and his Vice-President, John Mallory (Charles Martin Smith), are taking some time away from the White House. Mallory informs Fitzhugh of Nicolae's plans and how he has found evidence that Nicolae is planning a biological attack on American soil. Before he can share the information, Mallory is killed in an ambush, but a militia group comes to the aid of the President.\nBack at the Trib Force underground headquarters, Bruce Barnes performs a double wedding ceremony: Buck to Chloe, and Rayford to Amanda White, the newest member who once knew Rayford's first wife before the vanishings. After the ceremony is over, Buck heads over to Los Angeles and Rayford flies to New Babylon. Nicolae meets with Fitzhugh who expresses his deepest concern over the news of Mallory's death, and teams up with Carolyn Miller, who poses as Nicolae's top aide at GC headquarters. Together, they find Nicolae's secret plan of stealing Bibles and lacing them with anthrax before distributing them. The GC block their escape, and Fitzhugh kills one of the guards in the process.\nFitzhugh is recruited by Miller's ragtag military team to help take out Nicolae, which he participates in. He also learns that the British and Egyptian governments are working with the militia. Fitzhugh enters the GC building and asks to see the President (it is also revealed that one of the GC guards is really an insider, but is shot by another). Fitzhugh enters Nicolae's office, but Nicolae is already aware of Fitzhugh's assassination attempt and foils it. Fitzhugh tries to shoot Nicolae with three rounds, but he is not affected as they go through him and hit a guard instead. Using supernatural techniques, Nicolae throws Fitzhugh out of a 20-story window, landing on top of a car. Nicolae goes over to the window to see, in disgust, Fitzhugh getting up and walking away. Fitzhugh is not believed when he returns to the militia base to inform that the plan failed: Carolyn takes this the hardest.\nThe underground Trib Force HQ is hit the hardest as World War III approaches. Bruce and Chloe are infected with the virulent bacteria, but in the end, it is Chloe who miraculously survives when red wine, used in the communion they just took part of, is revealed to be the antidote. Buck meets Fitzhugh in a destroyed White House, where he helps the President become a Christian. Fitzhugh then confronts Nicolae in a final showdown where he activates a personal transmitter (and dials Carolyn's cell phone, where she hears the entire conversation), hoping to obliterate the entire GC headquarters, and himself, with a missile locked onto the transmitter's location. Fitzhugh dies in the resulting explosion, wiping out the GC base.\nBuck Williams gets a call in the elevator from Chloe as she tells him about the wine and Bruce's death.

She lowers her weapon and Buck states that they need to talk, implying that they had met before.

While Billy is looking for the girl, Fuzzy ties up the henchman and takes his boots and socks off to perform an Indian fire torture on the soles of his feet in effort to make him talk, but the man still refuses to tell him who gave him the letter and Fuzzy can't bring himself to burn the henchman. While trying to light a cigar, Fuzzy strokes a match down the sole of the man's foot causing him to burst with laughter. Having found out the henchman was ticklish, Fuzzy grabs his feet and ask him to tell him who gave him the letter. The man once again refuses so Fuzzy begins tickle torturing his bare feet. Fuzzy asked him again and the man still refuses to talk, but the more he refused the more Fuzzy would mercilessly keep tickling the soles of his feet. After enduring brutal tickling on his feet, the henchman can't take anymore and confesses. Fuzzy then tells his friends how the henchman was so ticklish that he got him to talk.

After ending his Mini Tour with a performance at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2000, he stated, \"I hate to waste the energy of a show-honed band so I've asked one and all if they would like to make an album immediately when we get back to New York.\" He then revealed his intention of re-recording these songs, explaining \"Not so much Pin Ups II as an Up Date I.\" Work on the \"Sixties album\" began a month later in July under the working title Toy, which came from a lyric in two songs recorded. The lineup consisted of the members of Bowie's touring band: guitarist Earl Slick, bassist Gail Ann Dorsey, pianist Mike Garson, musician Mark Plati and drummer Sterling Campbell.According to biographer David Buckley, the band rehearsed the songs at Sear Sound Studios in New York City before recording them as live tracks. Plati recalled: \"The idea was to keep it loose, fast, and not clean things up too much or dwell on perfection. As a result, we had 13 basic tracks cut in around nine days.\" Slick later told Rolling Stone: \"We had been doing a lot of gigs up to that point. We didn't have to do a whole lot of thinking about how to approach the songs. We had an operating system; an unspoken one. We hardly ever talked about anything. We'd just look at each other, or David would look at us, and it would just happen.\" He also stated that he refused to listen to Bowie's original recordings of the tracks, so to prevent the originals from influencing his playing on the new versions. Plati, whom Bowie chose to co-produce the project, was integral to the new album's sound. Pete Keppler engineered the sessions, while Bowie's former producer Tony Visconti provided string arrangements on two tracks. Recording took a two-month break in August due to the birth of Bowie and Iman's daughter Alexandria.Following the two-month break, multi-instrumentalist Lisa Germano was hired by Bowie, at Plati's suggestion, to contribute overdubs. After seeing her perform in New York for the rock band Eels in August, Plati stated \"I knew I needed to get her on the Bowie album.\" Germano was thrilled by the experience and both Bowie and Plati commended her contributions. Overdubs commenced at New York's Looking Glass Studios in October. Also hired were Gerry Leonard and Cuong Vu, who contributed guitar and trumpet, respectively. Also recorded during this time was a cover of the Who's \"Pictures of Lily\" for the tribute album Substitute: The Songs of the Who.

Leng remarks on Harrison's \"almost unseemly\" haste in returning to a studio and suggests that his \"bitterness and dismay\" post-Dark Horse was evident on much of the recording. Early on in the sessions, during his radio interview with WNEW-FM's Dave Herman, Harrison bemoaned the abandoning of 1960s idealism within the music industry and related this to the critical backlash he had recently received, from people who were \"just dropping apart at the seams with hate\", adding: \"I'm talking about Rolling Stone actually \u2013 talking about [founding editor] Jann Wenner.\"Harrison recorded the basic track for \"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\" at A&M Studios in Hollywood between 21 April and 7 May. Harrison played 12-string acoustic guitar, with support from David Foster on piano, and sparse, floor tom-heavy drumming from Jim Keltner. Klaus Voormann, Harrison's regular bass player and a friend since the Beatles' Hamburg years, chose to not participate in many of the sessions for Extra Texture, later citing the abundance of cocaine and Harrison's \"frame of mind when he was doing this album\". Harrison overdubbed the song's bass part using an ARP synthesizer, while Gary Wright provided the ARP strings atmospherics, a sound that characterised his hit album The Dream Weaver around this time. In the description of author Andrew Grant Jackson, the song's opening synthesizer part \"wouldn't sound out of place in a '70s horror flick or a Death Wish sequel\".When discussing \"This Guitar\" with Paul Gambaccini in London, in September, Harrison described the song as \"a cheap excuse to play some guitar\". Harrison played the slide guitar parts throughout the track, including the closing solo. Leng identifies both \"Pete Drake stylings\" and the influence of \"raga microtones\" in Harrison's performance. The wah-effected guitar solo midway through the song was performed by Jesse Ed Davis, who, having first supported Harrison at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, had since mirrored the ex-Beatle's guitar style on John Lennon's recent hit song \"#9 Dream\".

During the course of the Mass, however, the street choir begins expressing doubts and suspicions about the necessity of God in their lives and the role of the Mass. The street chorus sings with the Latin lyrics until they hit a line which they twist into a complaint or a self-serving boast; i.e. \"dona nobis pacem\" (English: \"grant us peace\") turns into the street chorus, \"Give us peace NOW!\" In this way, Bernstein interweaves and contrasts social commentary and prayer.\nThe street chorus's bitterness and anger continues to grow and makes each of the subsequent meditations more harsh. At the play's emotional climax, the growing cacophony of the chorus' complaining finally interrupts the elevation of the Body and Blood (the transubstantiated bread and wine). The Celebrant, in a furious rage, hurls the consecrated host, housed in an ornate cross-like monstrance, and the chalice, smashing them on the floor. At this sacrilege, the other cast members collapse to the ground as if dead while the Celebrant sings a solo. This solo blends the chorus's disbelief with his own crisis of faith. He feels worn out and wonders where the strength of his original faith has gone. At the end of his song, he too collapses.\nA bird-like (Holy Spirit) a capella solo begins again (now flute, rather than oboe), darting here and there from different speakers in the hall, finally \"alighting\" in a single clear note.

Several songs on the demo are nearly identical to the versions appearing on the debut album, but others have noticeable differences; the tempo of \"Take the Power Back\" on the demo, for example, is much slower and has a different final verse. The record is notable for the first appearance of the song \"Bullet in the Head\", which became a hit when reissued as a single later in the year after being transferred intact (with re-recorded vocals for the verses only) from the demo to the album.The song \"Darkness of Greed\" hails back to vocalist de la Rocha's previous band Inside Out, which broke up mid-1991. Inside Out performed the song on many occasions, and several RoIOs exist of those performances. (RATM later re-recorded the song for The Crow soundtrack.) Another significant indicator of Inside Out's influence on RATM's initial direction is the fact the name \"Rage Against the Machine\" is also the title of an Inside Out song.\nThe main riff from \"The Narrows\" would later be reused as the main riff for \"Fistful of Steel\" and parts of \"Mindset's a Threat\" would later become a part of \"Wake Up\" and are present in \"Freedom\" and in the solo on \"Bullet in the Head\". The main riff for \"Clear the Lane\" is nearly identical to that used on their 2000 cover of The Rolling Stones' \"Street Fighting Man\".\nThe songs \"Darkness of Greed\" and \"Clear the Lane\" were both digitally remastered and included as B-sides on the \"Killing in the Name\" single and have both been reissued on singles and promos many times since.\nThe artwork features images from a newspaper's stockmarket section with a single match taped to the inlay card.

{"id": "175_217", "question": "Who performed Wreck on the Highway?", "ctxs": [{"id": "175_22827", "text": "\"Wreck on the Highway\" is a song written and performed by Bruce Springsteen.  It was originally released as the final track on his fifth album, The River.  The version released on The River was recorded at The Power Station in New York in March\u2013April 1980.  As well as being the last track on The River, it was the last song recorded for the album.A melancholic song with a false ending, \"Wreck on the Highway\" features prominent organ and acoustic guitar parts.  The song is structured as a folk ballad with four verses of five lines each.  The rhyme scheme of the verse endings is generally ABCCB, but this is not followed absolutely strictly.  The lyrics describe a man who witnesses a hit-and-run auto accident on a rainy, isolated highway, and is subsequently haunted by the vision and unable to sleep.  After the first three verses focus on the specific incident, the last verse broadens the theme to encompass more universal themes of life and death.  The singer thinks about the life that was lost, and the people who may have loved him, and he knows he will be haunted by the incident for the rest of his life.  Springsteen has explained the theme by stating that after seeing the accident the singer \"realizes that you have a limited number of opportunities to love someone, to do your work, to be part of something, to parent your children, to do something good.\"  It is directly inspired by Roy Acuff's country song of the same name and similar theme from the 1940s, which is a cover version of the 1938 recorded song, \"I Didn't Hear Nobody Pray\", by the Dixon Brothers. While Springsteen's song has elements of a country arrangement, its music is more haunted and less sentimental.Along with the title track, \"Independence Day\" and \"Point Blank\", it is one of the verse-chorus songs on The River that was essentially a short story or character sketch. \"Wreck on the Highway\" and a few other songs on The River, such as the title track and \"Stolen Car\", mark a new direction in Bruce Springsteen's songwriting: these ballads imbued with a sense of hopelessness anticipate his next album, Nebraska, as well as a turn towards pessimism in his overall artistic and personal world-view. Springsteen himself has noted that \"Wreck on the Highway\" is one of the songs reflecting a shift in his songwriting style, linking The River to Nebraska.A slow-tempo song, \"Wreck on the Highway\" has not been particularly common in concert, with about 100 performances in Bruce Springsteen concerts through 2008.  Nearly all of those performances occurred during the 1980\u20131981 River Tour. The song was revived occasionally for electric piano performances on the 2005 solo Devils & Dust Tour. Naturally, the song was played every night during the 2016 \"River Tour\" during which the entire album was played at the outset of each show.\nIn the UK, it was released as the B-side of the single \"Cadillac Ranch\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

Navarro and Ferreira have developed a database of plant species in Bolivia and identified 39 separate vegetation zones in Bolivia within twelve general physiographic-biogeographical units of which four fall in the boundaries of Chuquisaca Department including:  Cordillera Oriental Central y Meridional, Prepuna or High Interandean Valleys, Bolivian-Tucuman Formation, and Chaco.  Using Navarro and Ferreira's categories and descriptions based on vegetation zones, the geographical and ecological characteristics of the Chuquisaca Department can be described as follows.\nCordillera Oriental Central y Meridional. From an elevation of 3200m in Chuquisaca to nearly 6000 meters in Potosi, this zone is characterized by the puna, altoandean, and subnival and nival ecological zones with a pluviestacional subhumid bioclimate.Prepuna or High Interandean Valley. From 2300m to 3200m, this zone is characterized by a mesotropical dry xeric bioclimatic zone. Seasonally torrential waters and salinity levels affect regional vegetation patterns in this zone.\nBolivian-Tucuman Formation. With a wide elevation range between 600m to 3900m this zone contains pluviestacional subhumid and locally humid bioclimatic zones. The high elevation Rio Grande and Pilcomayo river valleys transect this unit and are characterized by dry xeric vegetation zones with endemic and varied speciation especially in the Rio Grande river valley and vegetation influence from the Chaco in the Pilcomayo river valley.  Wet forest ecosystems like those found in more northern Yungas valleys are found on high ridges where clouds form.Chaco: from 400 to 900 m this unit is characterized by a xeric bioclimate. Sandy soils in this unit were formed from alluvial processes from the Parapeti and Grande rivers. Soil drainage affects vegetation dispersion within this unit.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They also booked more modern acts such as Alice Cooper, Chicago, and the Doors.On 12 September, Brower contacted Lennon, who was still a member of the Beatles, to ask him to be the master of ceremonies for the festival. Instead, Lennon offered to perform at the show with a new group, the Plastic Ono Band.\" Brower readily agreed, but since Lennon did not actually have a new group, he quickly began making phone calls to potential members to accompany himself and Yoko Ono. He initially approached Beatles band-mate George Harrison to play lead guitar, but Harrison declined, so Lennon turned to Eric Clapton, who had previously performed with Lennon in the one-off super group, the Dirty Mac. Bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Alan White soon agreed to perform, along with their assistants, Anthony Fawcett, Terry Doran, and Jill and Dan Richter. Voormann was a long-time friend of Lennon, but White, who was a respected session musician in London but did not know Lennon personally, initially thought that someone was prank calling him and only believed that the real John Lennon was on the phone when he called a second time.The group was scheduled to fly to Toronto on 12 September, the day before the concert, but Lennon, Ono, and Clapton were late to arrive at the airport. Lennon had talked to Clapton's management, but Clapton himself did not yet know that Lennon had invited him to perform and was not even aware of the concert. Brower managed to reach Clapton personally and told him to contact Lennon and Ono, who were still in bed. Clapton said he got \"a phone call on the day we were to leave and he said that someone had asked him to do that concert and it was that night! So I had to make the airport in an hour.\" The group had two quick rehearsals before appearing on stage. One was during the transatlantic flight from London to Toronto, though they could not hear the music very well since they were playing unplugged electric instruments. They had another at the concert venue shortly before appearing on stage. Lennon later said that the group \"didn't know what to play\" since they had not previously performed together, and they eventually settled on a set list consisting of older rock and roll standards, three Lennon-penned Beatle and solo songs, and two longer experimental songs featuring Ono.Though preparations for the show were rushed and chaotic, Lennon later said that he gained the confidence to leave the Beatles during those few days.

The trio informed Curtis\u2014whom they had seen at earlier punk gigs at The Electric Circus\u2014of their intentions to form a band and Curtis informed them of his then-recent efforts to do likewise, before proposing himself as both their singer and lyricist. Initially, Mason became the band's drummer, but his rehearsal sessions were largely unproductive and he briefly became the band's manager. The group then unsuccessfully attempted to recruit several drummers before selecting Stephen Morris in August 1977. The band was later managed by Rob Gretton, who\u2014having already seen Joy Division perform live at local venues such as Rafters\u2014offered to become their manager in 1978.Initially, the band named themselves \"Warsaw\", from the song title \u201cWarszawa\u201d on David Bowie's then-recent album Low, but as this name somewhat conflicted with that of a London-based group named Warsaw Pakt they renamed themselves Joy Division. This moniker was derived from the 1953 novella The House of Dolls, which featured a Nazi concentration camp with a sexual slavery wing called the \"Joy Division\". The cover of the band's first EP depicted a drawing of a Hitler Youth beating a drum and the A-side contained a song, \"Warsaw\", which was a musical retelling of the life of Nazi leader Rudolf Hess.After founding Factory Records with Alan Erasmus, Tony Wilson signed the band to his label following its first appearance on the TV music show he hosted, So It Goes, in September 1978. This appearance had been largely prompted by an abusive letter sent to Wilson by Curtis and saw the band play the song \"Shadowplay\".While performing with Joy Division, Curtis became known for his quiet and awkward demeanour and a unique dancing style reminiscent of the epileptic seizures he began experiencing in late 1978. Although predominantly a singer, Curtis also played guitar on a handful of tracks (usually when Sumner was playing synthesizer; \"Incubation\" and a Peel session version of \"Transmission\" were rare instances when both Sumner and Curtis played guitar). Initially, Curtis played Sumner's Shergold Masquerader, but in September 1979 he acquired his own guitar, a Vox Phantom VI Special which had many built-in effects used both live and in studio. This included a repeat effect misspelled as \"replat\" on the control panel.

This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work as an indicator of social class, such as in Husbands and Wives (1992). In Match Point, the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasizes his detachment from his crime.The 10-minute murder scene which forms the film's climax is scored with almost the whole of the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. This is an atypical scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which the words are as important as the music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.Arias and extracts include work by Verdi (in particular Macbeth, La traviata,  Il trovatore and Rigoletto), Gaetano Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, Georges Bizet's Les p\u00eacheurs de perles, and Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes's Salvator Rosa sung by Caruso. The romanza \"Una furtiva lagrima\" from L'elisir d'amore is featured repeatedly, including during the opening credits. The Caruso arias are supplemented by diegetic music from contemporary performances that the characters attend over the course of the film. There are scenes at the Royal Opera House and elsewhere performed by opera singers (scenes from La traviata performed by Janis Kelly and Alan Oke, from Rigoletto performed by Mary Hegarty), accompanied by a piano (performed by Tim Lole).", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "175_263", "question": "Who performed First?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_15716", "text": "The Blind Auditions\nThe blind auditions feature approximately 100 contestants who were selected during non-televised production pre-castings. At the beginning of the performance, the coaches have their backs turned to the participants, and if one of the coaches wants to take on a participant, they press their buttons and turn around to the singer who is automatically placed on his team. If more than one coach is turned around, the singer chooses the coach they want to work with. In the first four seasons and from the tenth, blind auditions end with the selection of 12 contestants. The size of the teams, however, varied over the seasons (13 in seasons 5 and 9; 14 in seasons 6 to 8; and 15 in season 14).\nFrom the eleventh season during blind auditions, each coach can \"block\" another. The coach against whom the block was used loses the chance to invite that participant to their team. Each coach can use this feature only twice. If a coach uses a \"block\" against another coach and  they do not turn around - the \"block\" is considered unused; this means that the block can be used as long as the coach who uses it actually \"blocks\" someone. \"Block\" buttons can be used both during and after a contestant's performance. In the fourteenth season, coaches will be able to use their block button only after a contestant's performance, unlike in the previous seasons.\nThe Battles round\nThis is followed by battles in which the coaches choose two people from their team (when the number of participants in a team is uneven, one of the battles is played by a trio, not a duo) who sing the same song together. The coach decides who moves on to the next stage and who drops out of the program. In the first season, coaches were assisted by invited specialists who were supposed to help them make the decision. From the second season onwards, the other coaches can make a \"steal\", i.e. take the loser to their team (by pressing their button). If more than one coach wants to steal a participant, that participant has the right to choose which team they want to go to. \nIn the seventh season, the \"stealing\" system has changed to what is known as the \"hot chairs\". Each coach can ultimately steal only one contestant (who sits on the hot seat assigned to that coach's team), because when \"stealing\" another contestant, the previously stolen person is replaced and dropped out of the competition; from the seventh to ninth seasons, each coach could steal (press the button and take over a contestant) up to three times, but from the tenth season, coaches can press the button to steal a contestant without any limitations. The battles therefore end with seven participants advancing to the next stage. During the ninth season, there was the first ever elimination of all participants from a team in one battle. \nIn season 14, battles have been divided into 2 parts: pre-battle and the main battle. During the pre-battle, the coaches pick three of their artists in a singing match and then select two of them to advance to the main battle to perform as a duo. During the main battle, the winning artists will battle once again, performing a different song. The coach select one of them to advance to the next round, while the other will be eliminated. At the end of this round, five artists will remain on each team. For the first time since the inaugural season, there are no steals during the battles round. \nThe Knockouts round\nThe battles are followed by the knockout round (in the first edition: overtime), in which the coaches eliminate more people who do not advance to the live episodes. During first six seasons, each of the coaches selected three people from his or her team (six people in the first season, seven people in the second season, eight people in seasons three to five, and nine people in the sixth season) who automatically qualified for the live shows. The coaches divided the others into threes (into two duos by the second season), and one person from each would move on to the next stage. Since the seventh season, all contestants have to sing - the first four from each team are automatically put in the hot seats, and after subsequent performances of the remaining three, the coach decides whether a given contestant stays in the show or not. Four (five in the first, second and sixth seasons) finalists from each team qualify for the live episodes. In the fourteenth season, five contestants will compete for the place in the live shows, but only four of them will advance to the next stage.\nThe Live Shows\nWhen the teams consist of five, four, or three contestants, the coach chooses from among the two contestants with the fewest votes from the viewers (who decide by sending text messages) the person who drops out of the show. Each live episode ends with the elimination of one person from each group. In eleventh season due to the coronavirus pandemic episodes were previously recorded and the elimination rules were changed. Once all participants from a given team sang their songs, the coaches scored the performances, awarding them from one to ten points. The coach of that team would then select one participant to move on to the next stage (regardless of the score). The participant with the lowest number of points was eliminated from the remaining three or two (in case of a tie, the points from the coach of the evaluated team were decisive).\nIn the semi-finals (when the team is made up of two people), the coach divides 100 points between the contestants and then everyone is credited with as many points as the percentage of votes they get from the viewers. In the fifth season, while the semi-final took the form of what is known in the international format as \"Cross Battles\", which involved contestants dueling between teams. In the semi-final of the eleventh season the deciding factor was the total number of points awarded by all the coaches.\nThe Final\nFour participants (one from each team, with the exception of the fifth season), and the winner is chosen by viewers in an SMS vote. Voting is divided into three rounds; after each round, the person with the fewest number of votes drops out. In the first round the finalists sing a foreign language song followed by a duet with their coach; in the second round the repertoire consists of Polish songs; in the third round the remaining two contestants sing their own songs. In the fourteenth season all contestants who will advance to the live shows will sing along with the finalists.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Their classic lineup (1964\u20131978) consisted of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century. Their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large public address systems, the use of synthesisers, Entwistle's and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk, power pop and mod bands. The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.\nThe Who evolved from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"I Can't Explain\" (1965), reached the UK top ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including \"My Generation\" (1965), \"Substitute\" (1966) and \"Happy Jack\" (1966). In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released \"I Can See for Miles\", their only US top-ten single. The group's 1969 concept album Tommy included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success.\nFurther festival appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight, along with the concert album Live at Leeds (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up the album Who's Next (1971), including the hits \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", \"Baba O'Riley\", and \"Behind Blue Eyes\". The group released another concept album, Quadrophenia (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy (1975). They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You (1978) was overshadowed by Moon's death shortly after.\nKenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed touring, and released a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of the group, they split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th-anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996\u20131997. A full reunion began in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with Endless Wire.  Since Entwistle's death, the Who have continued to perform and tour, most commonly with Starkey on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, and Pete's brother Simon Townshend on second guitar and backing vocals.

Beside the burial ground, on South Audley Street, was planned the Grosvenor Chapel, but this was not built until 7 years after the burial ground was laid out, in 1730.\nTo the north of the ground, the site of what is now 103 Mount Street, was the parish's workhouse, wherein the poor were given work, board, and lodgings, built in 1725 and then enlarged in the 1780s to provide room for the parish watchmen's watch-house and the parish office.\nIn the 1850s, Parliament passed a series of Burial Acts by which burial grounds in central London, such as that of St. George's, were to be closed due to health risks. The parish's other burial ground, on Bayswater Road, closed shortly afterwards, and the City of Westminster Cemetery, Hanwell in west London was used instead.\nAs the population of London grew, so did the demand upon the workhouse, and it became so overcrowded that in 1871 the decision was taken to move the workhouse to a new site, spurred on also by plans to widen Mount Street. In 1883, some land for the new workhouse on Buckingham Palace Road was bought from the new Duke of Westminster, Hugh Grosvenor, thricely-great-grand-nephew of the Baronet who originally sold the site of the burial ground, and paupers were transferred both to there and the parish's other workhouse at Little Chelsea on the Fulham Road, with the workhouse finally being demolished in 1886 and converted into more parish offices.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The ceremony had an adult volunteer cast of over 3,000 people, along with over 100 children and over 100 professional performers. Among the professional performers were 73 deaf and disabled performers and among the volunteers were 68 people with disabilities. In the build-up to the opening ceremony, an eight-week circus skills training programme took place at The Circus Space in Hoxton, London, and was run by 50 specialist performers. Participants included professional artists and many people who were new to the arts scene, such as soldiers undergoing rehabilitation and non-competing disabled athletes. The programme was funded by Arts Council England, and was part of the Enlightenment section, performing on a 35-metre high platform above the stadium floor.Stephen Daldry commenting on the ceremonies of London 2012 noted that \"if Danny Boyle's [Olympics opening ceremony] was very much about two revolutions and popular culture and Kim Gavin's [Olympics closing ceremony] was very much about a symphony of British music, then what you will get from Jenny and Bradley is something very different.\" Daldry also stated that \"there will be an extraordinary number of disabled performers in the cast.\" Sealey introduced Stephen Hawking as the \"most famous disabled person alive\" who will narrate \"the most exquisite journey,\" focusing on science and culture of the 18th century.

Sealey said that the character \"sees everybody but she doesn't judge. That is fundamental to our personal and political ethos,\" adding that it is \"fundamental, [that] you look without judging. It's about removing those attitudinal barriers.\" Sealey said that it was pure coincidence that she and Hemmings had chosen a line from the same play that was used by Boyle in the opening ceremony of the Olympics. \"When we found out Danny Boyle was going to reference Shakespeare's The Tempest we burst out laughing.\" Hemming, when comparing the Games to the Large Hadron Collider, said that the LHC \"transforms our perception of our place in the universe in the same way that the Paralympics transforms our perception of what's possible,\" while Sebastian Coe said that the ceremony would be a \"great showcase of the skills and excellence of disabled artists.\"Sealey and Hemming were determined to \"pay tribute to the contributions that science has made to the able bodied and impaired alike.\" The pair approached Hawking in late 2011, who was adamant that he would write his own part. Hawking commented on his role that \"to use this stage to show the world that regardless of differences between individuals, there is something that everyone is good at, is very important.\" Sealey and Hemming worked closely with Hawking to develop a series of messages for the ceremony and spent time with him in Cambridge; Hemming said Hawking had been \"incredibly gratified with him giving his time.\" Sealey said that although the ceremony has Hawking and Ian McKellen narrating, \"what we all need to remember: don't just look down at your feet, look at the stars, be curious.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was founded as a \"boutique label\" that prides itself on \"quality over quantity\", focusing on small numbers of high-profile releases.Dr. Dre Presents: The Aftermath was the label's first release. The compilation, featuring artists who were amongst the label's first signees, was released on November 26, 1996. A year later, on October 21, 1997, Aftermath released the only collaborative project by hip hop supergroup The Firm, composed of Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ and Nature. Despite the highly anticipated album featuring production and cameo appearances by Dr. Dre himself, debuting atop the Billboard 200 and being certified platinum, it sold below commercial expectation. The group was subsequently dropped from Aftermath and later disbanded.\nUpon recommendation from Interscope co-founder and Dre's close friend, Jimmy Iovine, he signed Eminem to Aftermath on March 9, 1998. On February 23, 1999, Eminem's major-label debut album, The Slim Shady LP was released. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, went on to be certified quadruple platinum, and arguably became the label's first successful album release. Also in 1999, on November 16, after a seven-year hiatus from releasing an album, Aftermath released 2001, Dr. Dre's follow-up to his 1992 album, The Chronic. The album went on to be certified sextuple platinum.\nSeveral more artists were signed to, and later dropped from Aftermath, including Hittman, Rakim, King T, Dawn Robinson and Eve, due to production, creative or business conflicts. Following the June 25, 2002 release of her debut album under Aftermath, Truthfully Speaking, singer Truth Hurts, Dr. Dre and producer DJ Quik faced a multi-million dollar lawsuit from Lata Mangeshkar over the unauthorized usage of one of her songs as a sample for her hit single, \"Addictive\". This caused sales from her debut album to dwindle and Truth Hurts to subsequently cut ties with the label soon after.In 2002, New York City rapper 50 Cent was signed to Aftermath by Dr. Dre through a joint venture with Eminem's Shady Records. His major-label debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin', was released on February 6, 2003 through the three labels. It mainly featured production from Dr. Dre and Eminem, who also executive produced the album. Highly anticipated and anchored by the success of the singles \"21 Questions\", \"If I Can't\" and the number one hit, \"In da Club\", the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Selling 872,000 copies in its first week, the album went on to be certified 9\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2020 with \"In da Club\" going diamond in 2023.Compton rapper The Game signed with the label in mid-2003 through a joint venture with 50 Cent's G-Unit Records, after a negotiation between Dre and Iovine. On January 18, 2005, Aftermath and G-Unit released his debut album, The Documentary, to commercial and critical acclaim. It stood upon the Billboard 200's number one position for a total of two weeks and went on to sell two million copies in the United States. Shortly after the release of The Documentary, tensions between the Game and 50 Cent ignited, with the latter dropping the former from his G-Unit imprint during an interview on a radio show, which provoked a shooting causing Game's friend to sustain a non-fatal bullet wound in his leg. After a truce, Game and 50 continued to clash through interviews and diss tracks, with the former catapulting the catchphrase, \"G-Unot\", a parody and boycott of G-Unit. This action resulted in Dr. Dre forcing the Game off of Aftermath in 2006.

In 2008, after internal conflict with Jimmy Iovine over the delaying of his planned eighth studio album, Blessed, Busta Rhymes was released from Interscope, causing him to lose his deal with Aftermath. The album would later be reworked into Back on My B.S. which would later be released in the spring of 2009, under Interscope's now-defunct sister label, Universal Motown, in conjunction with his own label, Flipmode Entertainment (now Conglomerate).Stat Quo, a rapper from Atlanta, was released from Aftermath and Eminem's Shady Records in 2008 after being a part of the joint deal for five years, citing differences in direction over whether or not to release his debut album, Statlanta. The album was later reworked and released independently in the summer of 2010.\nPhiladelphia rapper Eve, who had returned to the label in 2004, following her previous label, Ruff Ryders Entertainment, ending their distribution deal with Interscope, also ended her relationship with Aftermath for the second time, leaving the label in December 2007. The first time Eve joined Aftermath and was later dropped in 1998 in exchange for the label signing would-be labelmate, Eminem, she claimed to be \"devastated\". The second time is over Interscope and Geffen's constant delaying of her fourth studio album, Here I Am, which was set to be released under Aftermath, Swizz Beatz's Full Surface Records and Interscope's Geffen. Following a falling out with Interscope co-founder Jimmy Iovine, Eve parted ways with Interscope Geffen A&M in December 2009 and went on a four-year hiatus from music, before returning with her reworked fourth album, now titled Lip Lock, released independently in 2013.In January 2010, it was revealed that Bishop Lamont had left the label, due to the repeated delaying of his debut, The Reformation, while singer Marsha Ambrosius had also left the label the same year to sign with the now-defunct J Records.In March 2012, it was announced that Kendrick Lamar had signed with the label jointly through Top Dawg Entertainment. That October, his album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, was released. It received commercial and critical acclaim, becoming one of the best hip hop albums of that year and the 2010s overall.In October 2013, Jon Connor announced his signing to Aftermath during the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards. However, in May 2019, he parted ways with the label after the constant delaying of his planned debut album, Vehicle City, ending his four year relationship with Dre. On February 20, 2014, 50 Cent announced his departure from Interscope Records, which included his joint deal with Aftermath and Shady. He later signed to his own imprint, G-Unit Records, in a new distribution deal with Interscope's sister label, Capitol Records' former independent faction, Caroline Records (now Virgin Music).On March 15, 2015, Kendrick Lamar's third studio album, To Pimp a Butterfly, was released a week earlier than expected, due to a marketing error on behalf of Interscope. Despite this, the album received widespread acclaim and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming Lamar's first in his career to do so. On August 7, after fifteen years and nine months of not releasing an official album, Dr. Dre released his latest album, Compton, in promotion for the year's biopic, Straight Outta Compton, which chronicled the rise and fall of Dre's previous group, N.W.A. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. Through the album, Anderson .Paak, one of its core features, was in talks to sign with Aftermath. The deal did not complete until January 2016. However, Anderson was not signed to Interscope through the imprint, instead signing a management deal with Doug Morris' 12Tone Music. Through these labels, he released two albums, Oxnard (2018) and Ventura (2019).In May 2022, Kendrick Lamar announced his final album under Top Dawg, a double album titled Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers. It was released under TDE and Aftermath without further input from Dr. Dre nor Top Dawg affiliates. It is unclear whether if this album is also Lamar's final album under Aftermath as he recently shifted his focus on his own production label, PGLang.In 2023, it was announced and later confirmed that after 50 Cent and Stat Quo, Filipino rapper Ez Mil has officially signed to Aftermath and Shady.In December 2021, Dr. Dre has confirmed that he\u2019s finished recording Casablanco an album with Marsha Ambrosius, with both artists describing the finished product as some of their \u201cbest work\u201d.

Only days prior to being released digitally, the singer was announced as the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live, taking over for Janet Jackson who caught the flu and was unable to perform. Hosted by Jonah Hill, Carey performed both \"Touch My Body\", as well as live rendition of \"Migrate\" alongside T-Pain. Following the set, Carey and her manager at the time, Benny Medina, met with Lee Daniels, who then offered her a role in his film adaptation of Precious (2008), in which Carey would later star and earn acclaim for her acting. After reaching the top of the Billboard charts, the Empire State Building was lit up in Carey's motif colors, white, pink and lavender, for the entire week. On March 25, 2008, Carey was featured as the special guest performer at The Hills season premiere party, an event marking the start of a span of ten episodes airing in between season three and four. Carey performed \"Touch My Body\", \"I'm That Chick\" and \"We Belong Together\", before exiting the stage to a standing ovation. After the performance, Carey received strong praise from the program's cast members, with Lauren Conrad saying \"I've always been a huge Mariah fan, and she's just so beautiful and talented'. Whitney Port and Audrina Patridge referred to Carey as \"an amazing singer\", while claiming to have listened to her music from a young age. On April 12, 2008, Carey made an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Winfrey interviewed the singer on her weight loss, E=MC\u00b2, and even showed footage of Carey in her New York apartment, showing off her lingerie closet. Following the interview, Carey performed a live rendition of \"Bye Bye\" for the audience, with three background vocalists assisting her. Kevin Johnson from St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the performance as \"touching\", and complimented the song's appeal.\nOn the seventh season of the talent competition American Idol, Carey was featured as a mentor for the top-seven week. Titled \"Mariah Carey Week\" and airing live on April 14, 2008, the contestants were to perform a song from the singer's catalog. After all seven contestants sang their individual songs, they all came together for a live rendition of Carey's 1996 collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\". Overall, critics noted how a Carey themed week would be extremely difficult for the performers, due to their vocally strenuous nature. Following their joint performance, Carey emerged onto the stage and performed \"Bye Bye\" live, while backed by a trio of supporting vocalists. Tamara Jones of The Washington Post jokingly commented on Carey's flailing hand movements during the performance, writing how she was \"waving like a malevolent homecoming queen\". Gil Kaufman from MTV News complimented Carey's performance, commenting on her \"barely there micro-dress\" and writing how she \"serenaded the audience with her homage to lost ones.\" The Calgary Sun's Lindsey Ward described it as a \"less-than-fab performance\", although complimenting on Carey's leaner figure, \"Oh, who am I kidding? She would look hot in a paper bag.\" On April 25, 2008, Carey opened the Good Morning America \"Summer Concert Series\" with a live performance in Times Square. Carey, wearing a pink mini-skirt, began the set with \"Touch My Body\" in front of thousands of fans. During the song, her backing vocals began to malfunction, causing it to repeat phrases and play during her main vocal moments. In order to let the sound engineer know of the problem, she substituted part of the lyrics for \"stop singing my part now baby\", and completed the final chorus. She continued on with \"I'm That Chick\", and completed the three-song set-list with her follow-up single, \"Bye Bye\". After marking the album's stateside launch with her appearance on Good Morning America, Carey took to Europe to perform on several programs. She began with an interview on the British radio station, BBC Radio 1, and continued onto a live rendition of \"Touch My Body\" on both The Sunday Night Project and The Paul O'Grady Show.Similarly, Carey performed the song live on the German talent show, Deutschland sucht den Superstar (Germany searches for the superstar), in April 2008. On August 8, 2008, Carey performed a mash-up of the song at the 2008 Teen Choice Awards. She began with her single at the time, \"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\", and worked into the bridge of \"Touch My Body\", before reverting to the former song. At the Fashion Rocks ceremony in 2009, Carey performed \"Touch My Body\" and her current single, \"Obsessed\", as well as the remix to her 1995 song \"Fantasy\". During the set-list, Carey was accompanied by six men in black ties, who hoisted her into the air in front of over 6,000 people during \"Obsessed\", and rigorous dance routines throughout \"Touch My Body\". In promotion for E=MC\u00b2 and the single, Carey was featured as a guest judge and musical act on the fifth season of the British talent competition, The X Factor. During that week, all the contestants would have to sing songs from Carey's catalog. Prior to her arrival, one of the show's judges Dannii Minogue said \"Could it get any more nerve-wracking for the contestants?\", due to the general strenuous nature of Carey's songs. After several performances by the finalists, Carey performed \"I Stay in Love\", accompanied by three background vocalists. She received a standing ovation from the audience and judges, and continued backstage for a taped session with the contestants. At the end of the program, she performed her classic \"Hero\" (1993), and was eventually joined by the finalists for the finale of the song. \"Hero\" was re-recorded by the 2008 UK X Factor finalists and released as a single, becoming the best-selling single of 2008. According to reports, the episode gained a large increase in viewers due to Carey's presence, and was able to surpass its long-time rival program, Strictly Come Dancing, in the ratings. Carey made an appearance at the American Music Awards, held on November 23, 2008, at the Nokia Theatre. Wearing a long black gown, she performed the song after receiving an honorary award for her achievements in music. Chris Harris from MTV News described it as a \"riveting performance\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The ceremony had an adult volunteer cast of over 3,000 people, along with over 100 children and over 100 professional performers. Among the professional performers were 73 deaf and disabled performers and among the volunteers were 68 people with disabilities. In the build-up to the opening ceremony, an eight-week circus skills training programme took place at The Circus Space in Hoxton, London, and was run by 50 specialist performers. Participants included professional artists and many people who were new to the arts scene, such as soldiers undergoing rehabilitation and non-competing disabled athletes. The programme was funded by Arts Council England, and was part of the Enlightenment section, performing on a 35-metre high platform above the stadium floor.Stephen Daldry commenting on the ceremonies of London 2012 noted that \"if Danny Boyle's [Olympics opening ceremony] was very much about two revolutions and popular culture and Kim Gavin's [Olympics closing ceremony] was very much about a symphony of British music, then what you will get from Jenny and Bradley is something very different.\" Daldry also stated that \"there will be an extraordinary number of disabled performers in the cast.\" Sealey introduced Stephen Hawking as the \"most famous disabled person alive\" who will narrate \"the most exquisite journey,\" focusing on science and culture of the 18th century. As with the Olympics opening ceremony, The Tempest featured heavily and the character Miranda from the story starred in the ceremony, being the eyes for the audience. Sealey said that the character \"sees everybody but she doesn't judge. That is fundamental to our personal and political ethos,\" adding that it is \"fundamental, [that] you look without judging. It's about removing those attitudinal barriers.\" Sealey said that it was pure coincidence that she and Hemmings had chosen a line from the same play that was used by Boyle in the opening ceremony of the Olympics. \"When we found out Danny Boyle was going to reference Shakespeare's The Tempest we burst out laughing.\" Hemming, when comparing the Games to the Large Hadron Collider, said that the LHC \"transforms our perception of our place in the universe in the same way that the Paralympics transforms our perception of what's possible,\" while Sebastian Coe said that the ceremony would be a \"great showcase of the skills and excellence of disabled artists.\"Sealey and Hemming were determined to \"pay tribute to the contributions that science has made to the able bodied and impaired alike.\" The pair approached Hawking in late 2011, who was adamant that he would write his own part. Hawking commented on his role that \"to use this stage to show the world that regardless of differences between individuals, there is something that everyone is good at, is very important.\" Sealey and Hemming worked closely with Hawking to develop a series of messages for the ceremony and spent time with him in Cambridge; Hemming said Hawking had been \"incredibly gratified with him giving his time.\" Sealey said that although the ceremony has Hawking and Ian McKellen narrating, \"what we all need to remember: don't just look down at your feet, look at the stars, be curious.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Accordingly, project \"JxR\" was initiated in late 1945 and requirements were drawn up in October 1945. A pair of proposals were presented by the Saab design team, led by Lars Brising. The first of these, codenamed R 101, nicknamed cigarren (the cigar) due to its shape, bore a strong resemblance to the American Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star. The second design, which was chosen, was the barrel-shaped design, codenamed R 1001, which proved to be both faster and more agile.The R 1001 concept had a straight wing, but after the engineers obtained German swept wing research data, it was given a 25 degree sweep. Information on swept wings came through Switzerland and included drawings for the Messerschmitt P.1101, P.1110, P.1111 and P.1112. SAAB's project manager, Frid W\u00e4nstr\u00f6m, collected these documents in 1945 from Messerschmitt engineers who escaped to Switzerland at the end of the War. Among them were engineer and aerodynamicist Hermann Behrbohm, who joined Saab's J 29 team. These documents clearly indicated delta and swept-wing designs \"reduc[e] drag dramatically as the aircraft approached the sound barrier.\"To make the wing as thin as possible, the undercarriage retracted into the fuselage, rather than the wings. Wind tunnel testing at the Swedish Royal University of Technology and by the National Aeronautical Research Institute also influenced its aerodynamics. These tests determined the required fuselage form to ensure it could attain the targeted critical Mach number, as well as supporting the use of a straight-through airflow to maximize thrust. Automatically locking leading edge slots, interconnected with the flaps, were also deemed necessary for lateral stability during take-off and landing. To further verify the swept wing, a Saab Safir was modified with a full-scale wing as the Saab 201. The finalized design, incorporating the new information was drawn up in January 1946.\nThe original powerplant was to have been the de Havilland Goblin turbojet, however, in December 1945, the more powerful de Havilland Ghost became available. This was ideal as not only was the Ghost set up for a circular air intake, its diameter would fit within the planned fuselage. Following negotiations between de Havilland and Saab, the Ghost engine was selected to power the type.Despite early doubts for the supply of an equivalent to the American 75S aluminium alloy, Svenska Metallverken was able to manufacture it, although significantly larger sections were used than typical for aircraft construction. The structure employed heavy frames and stressed skin to meet conflicting requirements on space, strength, rigidity and accessibility.The Swedish Air Force requested verification of the performance and a production plan for the project in February 1946. In Autumn 1946, the Swedish Air Force formally ordered three prototypes, with the type designation J 29. Static testing of the full-scale mock-up revealed problems with pressure cabin leaks, and concerning aileron behavior. A hydraulic system was installed to solve the latter issue. However, these modifications delayed the first flight until after the hoped for date of 1 August 1948.The first flight by a Saab 29 prototype was on 1 September 1948, was made by S/L 'Bob' Moore, who was later the first managing director of Saab GB, UK. A problem with the landing gear affected the expected top speed of the aircraft. Following the flight, Moore described the aircraft as \"on the ground an ugly duckling \u2013 in the air, a swift.\"  Because of the shape of its fuselage, the Saab J 29 quickly received the nickname Flygande Tunnan (\"The Flying Barrel\"), or Tunnan (\"The Barrel\") for short. While not appreciated by SAAB, its short form was eventually adopted officially.Four prototypes were built for the test program. The first two lacked armament, carrying heavy test equipment in their place instead. The third was armed with four 20 mm (0.79 in) cannons. Air brakes on the fuselage and on the wings behind the rear spar and both conventional and combined aileron/flap arrangements were tested. Flight tests revealed that the J 29 prototypes could exceed the maximum Mach number for which they had been designed and flight performance figures were typically in excess of predicted values.Quantity production commenced in 1948; during May 1951, Br\u00e5valla Wing (F 13) received the first production aircraft.The Tunnan was produced in five main variants.\nThe J 29A fighter was the first model to enter service, and was followed by the J 29B and J 29E fighters, and finally the afterburner-equipped J 29F fighter, which was the final variant built. There was also a dedicated reconnaissance variant, the S 29C. Between 1950 and 1956, 661 Tunnans were completed, the largest production run for any Saab aircraft.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the first month of the war, she treated 1,255 patients, including over 100 patients with head wounds and 61 patients with abdominal wounds. Initially treatment was provided in tents covered in an insulating layer of clay, but by January 1905, Gedroits was accompanying the horse-drawn ambulances which brought the wounded to the hospital to perform triage, before entering the operating theater. She was appointed chief surgeon of the hospital train, which consisted of an operating car and five patient cars. The operating car was a specially equipped surgical unit, supplied by the Russian nobility to allow care to the wounded to be performed on the front lines. This put the medical personnel at grave risk, as unless there were wounded personnel in ambulances, tents or surgical trains, their neutrality was not recognized.Though many Russian, as well as French and British, military surgeons had discarded the idea of treating abdominal wounds, Gedroits recognized that early intervention was key. Standard treatment at the time required the patient to be placed in a semi-reclining position so that the wound could drain. In previous eras, without anesthesia, penetrating abdominal wounds were considered inoperable. Gedroits was the first to perform laparotomies on military patients, having extensive experience in abdominal surgery for hernias, the most frequent surgery she performed in the cement factory hospital. Her procedure required that the patient undergo the operation within three hours of receiving a wound. Her success rate was high, leading to recommendations being made in international medical journals to adopt mobile surgical units which allowed for rapid treatment. The Russian Army and the Russian Society of Military Doctors officially adopted Gedroits' operative procedures.Designed to treat 2,000 people, the nobles' hospital quickly exceeded its capacity and because it was on the front lines, mortality was high. With the Russian defeat, Gedroits helped organize the hospital evacuation from near the Fushun Mining region, which was performed under gunfire because the Russian troops refused to retreat until the patients were moved. Gedroits was credited with saving the life of Vasily Gurko, as well as that of a Japanese prince. In 1905, she returned to the Maltsov Factory Hospital as chief surgeon and was appointed chief doctor of the Lyudinovskaya Hospital. Compiling a 57-page report on her work during the war, which included illustrations, she presented her results on 27 July 1905 to the Society of Military Doctors. She was awarded the gold medal of diligence from the Order of Saint Anna by the army commander for her actions during the Battle of Mukden, the Ribbon of Saint George with the silver medal \"For Bravery\" (ru) by General N.

At the beginning of the performance, the coaches have their backs turned to the participants, and if one of the coaches wants to take on a participant, they press their buttons and turn around to the singer who is automatically placed on his team. If more than one coach is turned around, the singer chooses the coach they want to work with. In the first four seasons and from the tenth, blind auditions end with the selection of 12 contestants. The size of the teams, however, varied over the seasons (13 in seasons 5 and 9; 14 in seasons 6 to 8; and 15 in season 14).\nFrom the eleventh season during blind auditions, each coach can \"block\" another. The coach against whom the block was used loses the chance to invite that participant to their team. Each coach can use this feature only twice. If a coach uses a \"block\" against another coach and  they do not turn around - the \"block\" is considered unused; this means that the block can be used as long as the coach who uses it actually \"blocks\" someone. \"Block\" buttons can be used both during and after a contestant's performance. In the fourteenth season, coaches will be able to use their block button only after a contestant's performance, unlike in the previous seasons.\nThe Battles round\nThis is followed by battles in which the coaches choose two people from their team (when the number of participants in a team is uneven, one of the battles is played by a trio, not a duo) who sing the same song together. The coach decides who moves on to the next stage and who drops out of the program. In the first season, coaches were assisted by invited specialists who were supposed to help them make the decision. From the second season onwards, the other coaches can make a \"steal\", i.e. take the loser to their team (by pressing their button). If more than one coach wants to steal a participant, that participant has the right to choose which team they want to go to. \nIn the seventh season, the \"stealing\" system has changed to what is known as the \"hot chairs\". Each coach can ultimately steal only one contestant (who sits on the hot seat assigned to that coach's team), because when \"stealing\" another contestant, the previously stolen person is replaced and dropped out of the competition; from the seventh to ninth seasons, each coach could steal (press the button and take over a contestant) up to three times, but from the tenth season, coaches can press the button to steal a contestant without any limitations. The battles therefore end with seven participants advancing to the next stage. During the ninth season, there was the first ever elimination of all participants from a team in one battle. \nIn season 14, battles have been divided into 2 parts: pre-battle and the main battle. During the pre-battle, the coaches pick three of their artists in a singing match and then select two of them to advance to the main battle to perform as a duo. During the main battle, the winning artists will battle once again, performing a different song. The coach select one of them to advance to the next round, while the other will be eliminated. At the end of this round, five artists will remain on each team. For the first time since the inaugural season, there are no steals during the battles round. \nThe Knockouts round\nThe battles are followed by the knockout round (in the first edition: overtime), in which the coaches eliminate more people who do not advance to the live episodes. During first six seasons, each of the coaches selected three people from his or her team (six people in the first season, seven people in the second season, eight people in seasons three to five, and nine people in the sixth season) who automatically qualified for the live shows. The coaches divided the others into threes (into two duos by the second season), and one person from each would move on to the next stage. Since the seventh season, all contestants have to sing - the first four from each team are automatically put in the hot seats, and after subsequent performances of the remaining three, the coach decides whether a given contestant stays in the show or not. Four (five in the first, second and sixth seasons) finalists from each team qualify for the live episodes. In the fourteenth season, five contestants will compete for the place in the live shows, but only four of them will advance to the next stage.\nThe Live Shows\nWhen the teams consist of five, four, or three contestants, the coach chooses from among the two contestants with the fewest votes from the viewers (who decide by sending text messages) the person who drops out of the show. Each live episode ends with the elimination of one person from each group. In eleventh season due to the coronavirus pandemic episodes were previously recorded and the elimination rules were changed. Once all participants from a given team sang their songs, the coaches scored the performances, awarding them from one to ten points. The coach of that team would then select one participant to move on to the next stage (regardless of the score). The participant with the lowest number of points was eliminated from the remaining three or two (in case of a tie, the points from the coach of the evaluated team were decisive).\nIn the semi-finals (when the team is made up of two people), the coach divides 100 points between the contestants and then everyone is credited with as many points as the percentage of votes they get from the viewers. In the fifth season, while the semi-final took the form of what is known in the international format as \"Cross Battles\", which involved contestants dueling between teams. In the semi-final of the eleventh season the deciding factor was the total number of points awarded by all the coaches.\nThe Final\nFour participants (one from each team, with the exception of the fifth season), and the winner is chosen by viewers in an SMS vote. Voting is divided into three rounds; after each round, the person with the fewest number of votes drops out. In the first round the finalists sing a foreign language song followed by a duet with their coach; in the second round the repertoire consists of Polish songs; in the third round the remaining two contestants sing their own songs. In the fourteenth season all contestants who will advance to the live shows will sing along with the finalists.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As both an act of revenge and an attempt to replace the daughter that was destroyed, Lafargue performs a sex change operation on the imprisoned Vincent, and forces him to live as his wife. Throughout the story, Vincent struggles with the horror of what was done to him and the erasure of his own identity. He maintains fragments of his personality, and seems to despise Lafargue at times. \nIn the final sequence, Alex arrives at Lafargue's home, but meets Vincent, transformed as Eve. Vincent instantly recognizes Alex as his former criminal accomplice, who was also present during the rape of Lafargue's daughter. During an altercation, Lafargue shoots and kills Alex in front of Vincent. Vincent appears to have given up on holding on to his former identity and desire to escape when he submits to becoming Eve and helps Lafargue cover up the incident.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Deborah then drove to her parents' home to inform them of her intentions. When she returned to the couple's home at 77 Barton Street in Macclesfield, his demeanour had changed and he informed his wife of his intentions to spend the night alone, first making her promise not to return to the house before he had taken his scheduled 10 a.m. train to Manchester to meet his bandmates.In the early hours of the next morning, Curtis died by suicide. He had used the kitchen's washing line to hang himself after having written a note to Deborah in which he declared his love for her despite his recent affair with Honor\u00e9. Deborah found his body soon after. In her biography, Touching from a Distance, Deborah recalls finding her husband's body and initially thinking that he was still alive before noticing the rope around his neck. According to Tony Wilson, Curtis spent the few hours before his suicide watching Werner Herzog's 1977 film Stroszek and listening to Iggy Pop's 1977 album The Idiot. Stark notes the significance of this album, as Pop's title was inspired by Dostoyevsky's novel The Idiot about the spiritually sensitive epileptic prince who was driven mad by the tragic and violent society in which he lived.  His wife recollected that he had taken photographs of their wedding and their baby daughter off the walls, apparently to view them as he composed a note. In the note, he didn't state that he was going to kill himself, and asked Deborah not to contact him for a while. It is not clear whether Curtis intended this to be a suicide note.At the time of Curtis's suicide, Joy Division were on the eve of their debut North American tour. Deborah has stated that Curtis had viewed the upcoming tour with extreme trepidation, not only because of his extreme fear of flying (he had wanted to travel by ship) but also because he had expressed deep concerns as to how American audiences would react to his epilepsy. Deborah has also claimed that Curtis had confided in her on several occasions that he held no desire to live past his early twenties. He had expressed to both Deborah and Honor\u00e9 his deep concerns that his medical condition was likely to kill him, in addition to causing him to receive mockery from audiences, and that this mockery would only increase when performing before American audiences on the upcoming tour.According to Lindsay Reade, Curtis had informed her shortly before his death of his belief that, with his epilepsy, he could no longer perform live with the band. In addition, he had claimed that with the impending release of Closer, he believed the band had hit an artistic pinnacle.In a 2007 interview with The Guardian, Stephen Morris expressed regret that nobody had realised during Curtis's life the distress he was in, even though it was evident in his lyrics. Bassist Peter Hook reflected on the tragedy of the timing of Curtis's death, just before what might have been a breakthrough to fame. Hook also claimed that, prior to the release of the 2007 documentary Joy Division, a specialist in epilepsy had viewed the combination of drugs that Curtis had been prescribed for his condition and expressed concerns about the drugs' safety.Curtis's body was cremated at Macclesfield Crematorium on 23 May 1980, and his ashes were buried at Macclesfield Cemetery. A memorial stone, inscribed with \"Ian Curtis 18\u20135\u201380\" and \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\", was placed above his ashes. This memorial stone was stolen in mid-2008. A replacement, bearing the same inscription but in a sans-serif typeface, was placed in the same location.

Despite the DJ John Peel being a fan of their music, they never released any material, recording only an unreleased single at Open Eye Studios, in Liverpool and playing a few gigs in the North-West, most notably supporting Cabaret Voltaire at Nathan McGough's Plato's Ballroom in 1981, before disbanding the same year.\nNoko was hired by The Cure as bassist, for a one-off concert in Germany at Alabamahalle, Munich, filmed for television on 30.01.1984 and a live promotional 2-song TV appearance on BBC Oxford Road Show 24.02.1984. In addition he also recorded a 4-song radio session with the band on 02.02.1984 at BBC Maida Vale Studios for David Jensen, which was broadcast on 22.02.1984. He also formed two bands, Dynamo Futurista and The Umbrella. The latter group, consisting of Noko (guitar and vocals), Simon Hoare (drums), Mark Sanderson (bass) and James Gardner, released a total of three songs before folding, which were released on an EP called Make Hell (For The Beautiful People).\nFounder Buzzcock and Magazine frontman, Howard Devoto, started writing with Noko in 1986 with a view to putting a band together to play Factory Records' Festival of the Tenth Summer at the G-Mex arena in Manchester that summer to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Punk. They played a short set as Adultery, borrowing backline from the Smiths. (Noko also played a set with Pete Shelley at the same gig in a line-up that also included ex-Magazine drummer John Doyle).\nThe line-up for that Adultery show was: Howard Devoto \u2013 vocals, Noko \u2013 lead guitar/viola, Leroy James \u2013 keyboards/2nd guitar, Pete Kinski \u2013 bass, Simon Hoare \u2013 drums. Signing to Beggars Banquet in 1987 and deciding on the name Luxuria, Devoto and Noko released two LPs: Unanswerable Lust (1988) and Beastbox (1990) and toured Europe and USA throughout 1988 with a line-up of Devoto and Noko on vocals/guitars and viola as usual and Karl Leiker \u2013 bass, Mark Rowlett \u2013 Drums/Sequential Studio 440, James Gardner \u2013 keyboards, programming, Frog \u2013 guitar/keyboards. The final Luxuria gig at The Town & Country Club (now the London Forum) in London featured cameo appearances by Barry Adamson (bass) on a rendition of Magazine's \"The Light Pours Out of Me\" for an encore, and Morrissey, who read a passage of Marcel Proust's \"A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu\" over the intro of \"Mademoiselle\" before throwing the tattered book into the crowd as the band kicked into the song. (There is a bootleg recording of the gig in circulation).\nWhen Luxuria folded in 1990, Noko got together with school friends, brothers Trevor Gray and Howard Gray, and James Gardner and formed Apollo 440.\nThe band released a number of singles and EPs on their own StealthSonic Recordings label: \"Lolita\" (1990), \"Destiny\" (1991), \"Blackout\" (1992) and \"Lolita/Destiny '92\" (1992).\nApollo 440 made four albums: Millennium Fever (1995), ElectroGlide In Blue (1997), Gettin' High On Your Own Supply (1999), and Dude Descending A Staircase (2003) on Sony Records. The band have been playing live in one form or another since their inception in 1990 to the present day and chronologically the touring line-ups are as follows:\n1990\u20131992: The band featured all founding members on keyboards, sequencers and drum machines and MCs Stevie Hyper-D and Tigga-Max guesting from time to time on vocals.\n1993\u20131995: James Gardner left for New Zealand where he has since established himself as a prominent composer writing music for his ensemble 175 East. Noko moved over to electric guitar and lead vocals, Trevor Gray on keyboards, Howard Gray on bass, and ex-Modern Eon drummer Cliff Hewitt was added to the line-up first on electronic, then onto acoustic drums. (Kenny Cougar briefly replaced Rej on bass during 1999).\n1996\u20132000: Noko \u2013 guitar, Trevor Gray \u2013 keyboards, Howard Gray \u2013 vibe controller/live-mix, Cliff Hewitt \u2013 drums, Paul Kodish \u2013 drums, Reinallt Ap Gwynnedd \u2013 bass, Mary Byker (ex-Gaye Bykers on Acid) \u2013 lead vocals, Harry-K \u2013 DJ/vocals. Simeon Bowring from A1 People replaced Rej on bass for a number of European festivals in 2000.\n2007\u20132008: Noko \u2013 guitar, Trevor Gray \u2013 keyboards, Howard Gray \u2013 vibe controller/live-mix. Cliff Hewitt \u2013 drums, Reinallt Ap Gwynnedd \u2013 bass, Ewan MacFarlane \u2013 lead vocals, Ashley Krajewski \u2013 MPC/keyboards.\n2008\u2013present: Chuck Sabo briefly replaced Cliff Hewitt on drums in 2008 (and again in 2009) as Cliff had touring commitments with German artist Schiller; Steve Barney did the same in early 2010 and Mikey Cusick (who had previously played with Noko in Maximum Roach from 2004 to 2005) replaced Rej on bass in 2008 and remains the current Apollo 440 bassman.\nThe 2010 Apollo 440 touring line-up: Noko \u2013 guitar, Trevor Gray \u2013 keyboards, Howard Gray \u2013 vibe controller/live-mix. Cliff Hewitt \u2013 drums, Mikey Cusick \u2013 bass/vocals, Ewan MacFarlane \u2013 lead vocals, Ashley Krajewski \u2013 MPC/keyboards/vocals.\n2004 saw Noko in a two-man band with James Maker. The band released only one EP via Morrissey's Attack imprint (I'm Unbearable/Born That Way) and the two musicians parted early 2005 after touring with a full band line-up on Morrissey's European and UK dates including his Meltdown festival appearance at the Royal Festival Hall supporting the newly reformed New York Dolls. That line-up included Paul Kodish on drums, Simeon Bowring on bass, and Ashley Krajewski on keyboards.\nIn November 2008, Noko was announced as the guitarist of the reformed Magazine, joining his former collaborators Howard Devoto, Barry Adamson, John Doyle and Dave Formula.In summer 2009, Magazine played \"The Soap Show: Episode 2009\" at the Royal Festival Hall. It was shown in two halves, the first of which was The Correct Use Of Soap LP in its original running order followed by the B-sides and the song \"Upside Down\" which had never been performed live before. They also played selected European festivals with a set culled from the \"Real Life & Thereafter\" tour.\nThe band rounded off the year's activities with appearances on BBC TV's Later... with Jools Holland and the BBC Electric Proms.\nMagazine have released a brand new live DVD and CD, Real Life & Thereafter: Live at Manchester Academy 17.02.09.\n2009 also saw the completion and release of Noko's first full movie score. Une Affaire D'etat, a French-language political thriller based on best-selling novel Nos Fantastiques Ann\u00e9es Fric by Dominique Manotti was directed by \u00c9ric Valette and stars Andr\u00e9 Dussollier, Thierry Fr\u00e9mont and Rachida Brakni. European cinema release was in October of that year. A soundtrack CD is available on Milan Musique.\n2010 also saw the formation of Raw Chimp with Noko (guitar/vocals), his wife Deborah Fisher-Jones (bass), and Constance Kaler (lead vocals). Raw Chimp played their live debut that same year at the Download Festival.\nNoko also scored  \u00c9ric Valette's next movie, The Prey which was released in France in April 2011 with worldwide distribution to follow later in 2012. Another French-language thriller, it was written by Laurent Turner and the movie's producer Luc Bossi, The Prey stars Albert Dupontel, Alice Taglioni, St\u00e9phane Debac and Sergi Lopez.\nIt's a dark high-octane edgy chase movie starting in a prison and culminating in a tense mountain denouement. The score is essential orchestral with touches of electronica and a multitude of Noko's trademark guitar-textures.\nThe soundtrack CD is again available on Milan Musique.\nMagazine completed their No Thyself LP at the end of 2011, the first new material from the band since 1981's Magic, Murder and the Weather, which was released on the Wire-Sound label. The band toured the UK in November. The LP and tour and BBC radio session were the first to feature new bass-player Stan White who replaced Barry Adamson.\nApollo 440's fifth LP The Future's What It Used to Be was released at the beginning of 2012 and the group continue to play live.\nIn 2012, Noko stepped in on bass guitar and backing vocals with London neo-grunge trio Levyathan, alongside Simon Maxwell on drums and David Norris on guitar and lead vocals. The band recorded a Noko-produced debut LP later that year at Apollo Control but it was never released.\nIn February 2013, Noko and Brad Lee from Discoordinated performed at Matthew Glamorre's multi-media series of art-happenings, C.R.U.X. at Zero-One Gallery in Hopkins St. Soho, London W1.\nThey revisited their 2-man version of Roxy Music's classic, \"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\", last performed in 2007.\nIn March 2013, Noko composed and performed his one-man live music score on electric guitar to Theatre Of Post Eroticism's production of BDSM Faust : an adaption of Johann Wolfgang Goethe's 1808 \"Faust\" (Part 1). There was another UK run of the production in June and the show was performed in Romania later in the year.\nIn 2014, Noko co-wrote/ co-produced some tracks for Japanese guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei's LP New Beginnings (released in Japan Virgin/Universal TYCT-60046).\nThese were \"Sons Of Sorrow\", \"New Chemical\" and \"Barrel Of My Own Gun\". Noko played bass guitar on \"Sons Of Sorrow\" and \"Barrel Of My Own Gun\" and vocals on \"Barrel of my own Gun\" and \"New Chemical\".\nWhen Hotei later signed to Universal's Spinefarm imprint, this LP was repackaged with some extra tracks for release outside of Japan as Strangers (SPINE663762) and included a re-worked version of \"New Chemical\" titled \"Move It\", featuring a lead vocal by Richard Z. Kruspe from Rammstein.\nIt was at Noko's suggestion that Hotei approached Iggy Pop to sing two other tracks on the album, which became \"How The Cookie Crumbles\" and \"Walking Through The Night\".\nHotei and Noko have been friends since 1997, first meeting when Apollo 440 remixed one of Hotei's tracks. They share a birthday, having both been born on exactly the same day, 1 February 1962.\nSince 2014 Noko has periodically toured with Hotei in Europe, U.S. and Japan, playing bass guitar in various line-ups, including drummers Steve Barney, Cliff Hewitt and Zachary Alford.\nLater in 2014, Noko produced and mixed Pop Will Eat Itself's \"Reclaim The Game (Funk FIFA)\" unofficial Brazil World Cup 2014 theme featuring Brazilian rap artist BNeg\u00e3o.\nNoko went on to produce and mix some tracks for the band's 2015 Anti-Nasty League album (RUMJOINT0005): \"Sacrifice And Pain\", \"Director's Cut\" and \"Mental Pollution\" (to which he had a writing contribution), playing additional guitar, bass and various keyboard/programming enhancements along the way.\nThis led to the band he formed with Brad Lee, $HirtLiftA supporting PWEI on their UK tour that summer: Brad Lee on vocals, Noko on guitar and Frank Horovich on guitar and electronics.\nIn 2016, Noko reunited with Matthew Glamorre to form SCISM, the 'house-band' at his SCISM audio-visual, multi-media art-happening nightclub on EU Referendum night in London.\nThey recorded and released \"Dalston Bump\" to coincide with a series of events at Vogue Fabrics in Dalston.\nIn Summer 2017 SCISM played a set at Churchtown festival in Cornwall and again in September at The Bargehouse in London as part of Open London weekend.\nIn April 2017, Magazine released the vinyl-only \"Old World Charm\" (WIRED42) : 6 tracks recorded at the BBC Electric Proms at Roundhouse, London in 2009. The Graeme Oxby pic on the rear of the sleeve featured Noko's MXR 'flanger-on-a-stick'.\nNoko composed and produced the music score for director Darren Cavanagh's feature-length documentary Ex-Dominatrix, for release in December 2017.\nThe movie opened the 2019 London Fetish Film Festival, at which it won Best Feature.\nIn 2017, Noko and Mary Byker started work recording a body of songs that would become the debut Am I Dead Yet? album, which was released on the Wire-Sound label in April 2019 (WIRED#48). A 5-track remix EP, \u201cNever Mind The Bolex\u2026Am I Dead Yet? reimagined on 35mm\u201d(WIRED#49), which featured cinematic dub remixes of some of the album highlights, was released as a download only, free with advance-orders of the album during the crowd-fun run-up to the actual release. Live dates promoting the album saw the live line-up expanded with the addition of Cliff Hewitt from Apollo 440 on drums and Derek \u2018Hoodlum Priest\u2019 Thompson on bass guitar.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Diana Ross and Eddie Kendricks shared lead vocals, although Otis Williams worked with Ross during a spoken interlude which was original to this version of the song.\nRoss & the Supremes and the Temptations performed several of the songs from their joint album on their headlining TCB television special which aired in December 1968 and it was originally planned that their rendition of \"The Impossible Dream\", the special's climactic performance, be their joint album's lead single.

Kai and Asano's daughter Mika fall in love, despite the scorn her father's samurai hold for Kai\u2019s mixed ancestry.\nLord Kira, the Sh\u014dgun's master of ceremonies, seeks to take Ak\u014d for himself with the help of Mizuki, a shapeshifting kitsune. She sends a kirin to kill Asano and his men on a hunting trip, leading Kai to ride to their aid. Taking up a fallen sword, Kai slays the monster and spots Mizuki in the form of a white fox with different-colored eyes. When the Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi visits Ak\u014d, Kai notices Mizuki disguised as a concubine with the same multi-colored eyes. He tries to warn Asano's principal counselor, Oishi, about the witch in Kira's household, but is dismissed.\nFor the entertainment of the Sh\u014dgun, Kira arranges a duel between his best warrior, a golem, and Asano's chosen combatant, whom Mizuki incapacitates with magic. Kai secretly dons his armor to fight in his stead, but is unmasked during the duel, and the Sh\u014dgun orders him severely beaten. That night, Mizuki bewitches Asano into believing Kira is raping Mika, causing him to attack the unarmed lord. Sentenced to death, Asano is compelled to perform seppuku to preserve his honor. The Sh\u014dgun gives Kira domain over Ak\u014d and Mika, granting her one year of mourning before she must marry Kira. The Sh\u014dgun brands Oishi and his men ronin, forbidding them from avenging Asano, and Kira has Oishi imprisoned and Kai sold into slavery.\nNearly a year later, Oishi is released by his captors, believing him harmless. Having realized that Kira used sorcery to frame Asano, Oishi and his son Chikara reunite the scattered ronin, and rescue Kai from the fighting pits of the Dutch colony of Dejima. Kai leads them to the mystical Tengu Forest, which he escaped as a child, to obtain the special blades of the Tengu. Warning Oishi never to draw his sword inside the Tengu temple, Kai faces the Tengu Master who once trained him. Faced with an illusion of his men being slaughtered by the Tengu, Oishi resists the urge to draw his sword, while Kai bests his former master. Having proven themselves worthy, the ronin receive their blades.\nThey plan to ambush Kira on his pilgrimage to a shrine to seek blessings for his wedding to Mika, but the procession is a trap and most of the ronin are killed. Believing them all dead, Mizuki presents Kira with Oishi's sword, and taunts Mika with their deaths. Oishi and Kai, having survived the attack, lead half the remaining ronin to infiltrate Kira's castle, disguised as a band of wedding performers. With Kira's men distracted during the performance, the other ronin scale the castle walls and attack the guards. While Oishi fights Kira, Kai and Mika face Mizuki in the form of a dragon, and Kai finally draws on the mystical powers of the Tengu to kill her. Oishi emerges with Kira's severed head, and Kira's retainers surrender.\nThe ronin and Kai surrender themselves to the authorities of the bakufu and are sentenced to death, having violated the Sh\u014dgun's prohibition on avenging Asano. However, the Sh\u014dgun declares that they followed the principles of bushido and restores their honor as samurai, allowing them to perform seppuku and receive the honor of burial with Asano. The Sh\u014dgun returns domain of Ak\u014d to Mika, and pardons Chikara so that he may preserve Oishi\u2019s bloodline and serve Ak\u014d.\nAn epilogue explains the tradition of paying respect at the graves of the 47 Ronin, which continues every year on December 14.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to Corgan, the whistling sound (feedback) heard in \"Mayonaise\" came from a cheap guitar he bought, which, whenever he stopped playing it, created the whistling sound. This sound was then incorporated into the song. Corgan apparently got the title for the song after he looked \"in [his] refrigerator\". Later, he stated in an interview with a Colombian radio station that the name stands for the phonetics of \"My Own Eyes\".\nIha stated that he \"came up with those chords and did a demo of it, it was an instrumental demo of the song. I played it for Billy and he liked it, he came up with the vocal melody and the lyrics. We worked on the arrangement together.\"While appearing on the podcast REINVENTED with Jen Eckhart on 20 October 2022, Billy Corgan admitted that previous explanations for the song title were inside jokes and disclosed the true story. The band visited Japan in 1992 while touring Gish and noticed that the record company had mistranslated a lyric from Gish into a fan booklet as \"mayonnaise seas\". The band thought this mondegreen was funny and used \"Mayonaise\"  [sic] as a temporary song title when recording Siamese Dream and it eventually stuck.While appearing on Q101's Brian and Kenzie Show on 4 July 2023, Billy Corgan specified that the mondegreen cited above was from a lyric on the song \"Rhinoceros\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Greene gave modest praise to \"Magdalena\" which he wrote \"sounds, passingly, like a lesser track from Bossanova or Teenager of the Year\", but panned \"Blue Eyed Hexe\", writing \"[Black Francis] screams like a Brian Johnson imitator over a foursquare riff with no wit or play in it, the clonking woodblock hitting like a kid brother socking you repeatedly in the arm.\" John Dolan from Rolling Stone wrote that EP2 \"feels like a faint echo of the band's later albums\".Mark Beaumont at NME gave the EP a positive review, writing that the four tracks \"eschew any attempt to recreate the breathless brutalities of Doolittle or Surfer Rosa and instead move Pixies boldly on\". Beaumont praised \"Blue Eyed Hexe\" for recreating \"the menace of Pixies\u2019 early work\" and described \"Greens and Blues\" as \"the most grab-at-the-sky Big Pop moment the new EPs have produced so far\".

{"id": "175_368", "question": "Who performed Songs of Innocence?", "ctxs": [{"id": "175_23340", "text": "According to music journalist Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production \"puts a higher gloss, and sometimes a heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound\". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as \"the most personal album we've written\". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, \"Let's try to figure out why we wanted to be in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys\u2014first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually.\" He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he wanted to be in a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, \"The person you need to be to make the album that you wanna make is a long way from where you live.\" Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, a notion that Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration.\n\nOpening track \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)\" pays tribute to Joey Ramone, the Ramones' lead singer who was particularly influential on Bono. During their teenage years, U2 snuck into a Ramones concert, and the experience of watching Joey perform made Bono feel less self-conscious about his own singing. \"Every Breaking Wave\" is about the difficulty of \"giv[ing] yourself completely to another person\", with lyrical characters who are \"addicted to sort of failure and rebirth\". \"California (There Is No End to Love)\" recalls the group's first visit to Los Angeles and how the city contrasted with their native Dublin. \"Song for Someone\" is a love song Bono wrote for his wife Ali Hewson, who he met during their teenage years. \"Iris (Hold Me Close)\" is written about Bono's mother, Iris, who died after suffering a cerebral aneurysm at her father's funeral when Bono was 14 years old. The lyrics liken her influence over her son to a star that died long ago but whose light is still reaching earth. Bono rewrote the song's lyrics after reading a letter that journalist James Foley wrote in captivity to his family prior to his being killed by ISIS; the letters made Bono realize that \"we will all be remembered by the least-profound moments. The simplest moments.\"The lyrics for \"Volcano\" are written from the perspective of a younger Bono addressing his modern-day self; he said, \"It's this young guy going, 'The fuck happened to you?'\" The Edge composed the song's bass intro. \"Raised by Wolves\" is about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, which killed 33 people but were narrowly avoided by Bono that day. The song is written from the perspective of Andy Rowen (brother of Bono's childhood friend Guggi), whose presence at the bombings would later drive him into heroin addiction, a subject also addressed in U2's 1984 song \"Bad\". \"Cedarwood Road\" reminisces about the street in Dublin on which Bono lived during his youth. The cherry blossom tree referenced in the lyrics was from the Rowen family garden. \"Sleep Like a Baby Tonight\", written about a pedophile priest, was described by Q's Tom Doyle as featuring \"deceptively lullaby-like... synth pulses\" reminiscent of Kraftwerk. Their album The Man-Machine was gifted by Bono to Ali when they were dating as teenagers and is name-checked in \"Iris (Hold Me Close)\" in the line, \"But it was you who made me your man/Machine\". \"This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now\" takes musical cues from one of the group's childhood inspirations, the Clash; according to the liner notes, the song is dedicated to the Clash's guitarist/vocalist Joe Strummer. The lyrics were inspired by Bono's realisation that he had found a new family and home in the form of U2, having felt like his childhood house was no longer home after his mother's death. The closing track, \"The Troubles\", was described by Bono as \"an uncomfortable song about domestic violence\".The deluxe editions of the album feature two additional songs. \"Lucifer's Hands\" is based on an instrumental piece titled \"Return of the Stingray Guitar\" that U2 debuted live in 2010 and performed as the opening song at each of their 32 concerts that year. \"The Crystal Ballroom\" is written about the former Dublin nightclub of the same name (later known as McGonagle's) where the band frequently performed in their early years. Lyrically, Bono imagines himself on-stage at the venue witnessing his parents dancing in the audience.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She had a lovely voice, and studied singing with several vocal teachers of renown; but she was never confident about her own achievements, and could hardly ever be induced to sing before any one. The few people who heard her sing have never forgotten her quite peculiar charm. She had a wonderful ear, the gift known as \"absolute pitch,\" and could transpose easily at sight.

The main Octavarium world tour began in September in Finland, and saw the band continue with their \"An Evening With Dream Theater\" concert format.

New Order were formed in 1980 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The group began life as a continuation of their former incarnation Joy Division. Joy Division had disbanded after the death of the lead singer Ian Curtis. Gillian Gilbert, who was Morris's girlfriend at the time, soon joined the group and played guitar and keyboards.\nRemarkably, New Order's first eight singles released between 1981 and 1984 were not taken from any album. In most cases they were not even released as a 7-inch, but exclusively available in the radio-unfriendly 12-inch format, an unusual approach for a pop-act in the eighties.\nDespite the high anticipation that surrounded the group, their debut single \"Ceremony\" only peaked at number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The group's following two singles and their debut album met with similar moderate success. It would not be until the release of their fourth single, \"Blue Monday\", that New Order would break into the top 10, with the song peaking at number 9. \"Blue Monday\" became a defining single for the group and caused a sensation, becoming the biggest selling 12-inch single of all time.New Order, like many other post-punk groups of the period, increasingly utilised keyboards, drum machine and sequencers in their music. As a result, they became associated with the synthpop and electronic dance movements of the 1980s. Beginning with Power, Corruption & Lies from 1983, all of the group's studio albums reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The group experienced a lull in popularity in the years 1985 and 1986 but the surprise international popularity of the \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" single re-launched the group across the world. The group cemented their success in 1987 with the single, \"True Faith\", and the compilation album Substance.\nNew Order were at the peak of their popularity in the years 1987 to 1993, with a run of popular singles, including \"Blue Monday 1988\", \"Fine Time\", \"Regret\", \"World (The Price of Love)\" and in 1990 they scored their only number 1 single in the UK with the official England national football team song, \"World in Motion\". The two albums released during these years, Technique and Republic; each charted at number 1 in the UK. It was during this successful period that the group's internal dynamic began to falter. Sumner was not fond of touring, and wanted to take time off from the group and produce a solo album. He formed Electronic with Johnny Marr and the pair released their first single in 1989. Hook formed his own band, Revenge, in 1989, while Morris and Gilbert worked together as The Other Two, primarily scoring soundtracks. Of the three side projects, Sumner's was by far the most successful.\nThe recording and touring of 1993's Republic, their first for London Records, was difficult and intra-band tensions were rife. The group went on hiatus until 1998. In the meantime two compilation albums, The Best of New Order and The Rest of New Order, and several singles were released.\nThe group reconvened in 1998 for the Reading Festival but did not release new material until 2000. The group released the album Get Ready in 2001. It was met with critical warmth, but it was apparent that the group's popularity had lessened. The lead single from the album, \"Crystal\", reached the top 10 in the UK. The film 24 Hour Party People, a humorous chronicle of their label Factory Records, was released in 2002. New Order contributed a new song, \"Here to Stay\", and a re-recording of the Joy Division song \"New Dawn Fades\" with Moby, for the film's soundtrack. The compilation International and four-disc boxset Retro were released in winter 2002. New Order followed Get Ready with Waiting for the Sirens' Call in 2005. During this period Gilbert stepped down from live performances due to family commitments. Phil Cunningham stepped into her role and in 2005 became an official member of the group.\nThe group had intended to release a ninth album soon after Waiting for the Sirens' Call, the majority of which had already been recorded. The lack of enthusiasm inside the group and relative failure of Waiting for the Sirens' Call stalled their career momentum. In 2007, Hook decided to leave the group, and stated that he and Sumner had no further plans to work together. Sumner formed Bad Lieutenant with Cunningham, and Hook formed Freebass. Morris continued to work with Sumner and Cunningham. In 2008, New Order released remastered and expanded editions of their first five albums with the intention of releasing the further three albums in a similar format in the future.\nLost Sirens was released in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2013. It is an eight-track album of tracks left out of Waiting for the Sirens' Call. On 25 September 2015, the band released a new album, Music Complete.

A deluxe edition of Dream With Me, available exclusively from Target, featured four bonus tracks: \"Someday\", \"Mi Mancherai\", \"The Impossible Dream\" and \"A Time For Us\".Evancho performed nearly the same songs as those on the Dream With Me CD for her first solo concert televised special, which first aired in June 2011 on PBS stations (\"The Prayer\" was omitted, but \"Dark Waltz\" and \"Mi Mancherai\" were added). The program was part of the PBS Great Performances series, co-produced by SYCO/Columbia.  It was frequently rebroadcast during 2011, and by early August 2011, the special had been broadcast nearly 2,000 times. It became \"one of the most viewed specials in the 38-year-history of the Great Performances series [and] raised record amounts of money for PBS stations.\" The special continued to be shown into 2013.Evancho was the youngest solo artist ever to headline a special on the Great Performances series.  The concert was taped in April 2011 at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida, and was co-hosted by David Foster, who played the piano in the orchestra for many of the selections, while Conrad Tao played piano and violin in some selections.  The performances are available as a CD/DVD titled Dream With Me In Concert. Allmusic noted: \"the concert version ... sounds nearly identical (outside of the waves of applause) to the studio album ... but the accompanying DVD, which features the heavily choreographed performance, as well as an extensive photo gallery and interviews with both Evancho and Foster, should provide enough eye and ear candy to appease fans of the gifted young vocalist until a proper follow-up appears.In July 2011, the singer began her first official tour across the United States, to promote the album. It consisted of a series of performances with symphony orchestras, beginning with the Sun Valley Orchestra on July 31, followed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra on August 5, the Ravinia Festival Orchestra on August 7, the Omaha Symphony Orchestra on August 26, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra on August 31 and her hometown Pittsburgh Opera on October 16.  Conductor Antony Walker took the opportunity to introduce her fans (many of whom were newcomers to opera) to the Pittsburgh Opera's chorus and soloists, who performed several numbers from Verdi, Bizet and Puccini along with Evancho's repertoire. Evancho made her New York City concert debut at Avery Fisher Hall with songs from the album on November 7, 2011. Her last concert of the year was in Las Vegas with David Foster in Las Vegas on December 29.After presenting her concert in Japan in January 2012 with the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, Evancho resumed her U.S. \"Dream With Me\" tour later the same month in California.

The legislature, empowered by the Constitution of 1852 which limited the King's authority, struck down the healthcare plan. Alexander and Queen Emma responded to the legislature's refusal by lobbying local businessmen, merchants and wealthy residents to fund their healthcare agenda.

As part of promotion for \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\"'s release as a single, Spears performed it at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards and at the 1999 Billboard Music Awards. It was also performed on five concert tours, the first being the ...Baby One More Time Tour (1999). The show began with a dance introduction by Spears' dancers among smoke effects. She appeared shortly after at the top of the staircase wearing a hot pink vinyl tube top and white vinyl pants with pink knee patches. During the 2000 leg of the tour, entitled Crazy 2k Tour, Spears changed the opening sequence of the show; the show started with a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of \"...Baby One More Time\". She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\", which included a chair dance sequence referencing Janet Jackson's \"Miss You Much\" music video that ended with Spears saying \"Is that the end?\", quoting Jackson's phrase from the video. The song was once again performed in a dance-oriented form on the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000\u20132001), while on the Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001\u20132002), the performance featured Spears being captured by her dancers. \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was also performed on The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004). For the tour, the song was remixed with elements of latin percussion. \"Crazy\" would not be performed by Spears for another nine years until it was included on the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show, Britney: Piece of Me (2013\u20132017).In 2002, British nu metal band SugarComa covered \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" and included it on their album Becoming Something Else.

The venture also benefited from its parent's existing marketing agreements with major web portals such as America Online, MSN, and Excite. A marketing agreement was also entered into with then-major search engine/portal Lycos. An additional incentive was the promise of a $100 reward to the first 10,000 customers. There was also an introductory 10% interest for a short period when opening a new checking account.\nDespite being owned by Bank One, an existing brick and mortar banking institution based in Chicago, Wingspan was branded wholly separately and with minimal acknowledgment of the relationship. As a result, Wingspan's online-only operation effectively competed with Bank One's own online presence, particularly as the online bank's lack of physical presence allowed it to provide better fees and rates for customers. The bank provided most traditional financial services from interest-bearing checking accounts to credit cards, Individual Retirement Accounts and HELOCs. It also provided bill pay, with on-time payment guarantee, although the payment was physically done via the bank mailing a check to the payee in most cases.\nThe lack of physical presence was ultimately a negative for the bank. While customers were able to use Bank One ATMs for free, they could not use any physical bank branches. Non-electronic deposits had to be made via postal mail. The bank refunded up to $5 in ATM fees per month for customers not living in Bank One's footprint.\nBy September 2001, Bank One discontinued the Wingspan brand and rolled the online bank's customers into Bank One's existing online service as regular account holders. The parent company cited the online bank's inability to attract a sufficient number of customers as the reason for its closure. The reintegration of Bank One's online venture followed a similar action by Citibank with its Citi/fi brand, and other online banks such as Telebank merged with or entered into service agreements with physical banks.\nCEO Jim Stewart left Wingspan in late 1999 to form Juniper Financial.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After a spending spree, the pair are stranded without enough money to buy plane tickets home, forcing them to live with Tsubasa, a Japanese friend of Piro's. When Tsubasa suddenly departs for America to seek his \"first true love\", the protagonists are forced out of the apartment. Tsubasa leaves Ping, a robot girl PlayStation 2 accessory, in their care. This leads to old friends of Piro and Largo showing up later. The two are shadow operatives for video game companies, Ed (Sony) and Dom (SEGA).\nAt one point, Piro, confronted with girl troubles, visits the local bookstore to \"research\"\u2014look in the vast shelves of shoujo manga for a solution to his problem. A spunky schoolgirl, Sonoda Yuki, and her friends, Asako and Mami, see him sitting amidst piles of read manga, and ask him what he is doing. Piro, flustered, runs away, accidentally leaving behind his bookbag and sketchbook.\nAfter their eviction, Piro begins work at \"Megagamers\", a store specializing in anime, manga, and video games. His employer allows him and Largo to live in the apartment above the store. Largo is mistaken for the new English teacher at a local school, where he takes on the alias \"Great Teacher Largo\" and instructs his students in L33t, video games, and about computers.  Yuki's father, Inspector Sonada Masamichi of the \"Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division\" (TPCD) hires Largo after Largo manipulates Ping into stopping a rampaging monster, the drunken turtle Gameru.\nAs Largo is working at the local high school, Piro encounters Yuki again while working at Megagamers, when she returns his bookbag and sketchbook, scribbled all over with comments about his drawings. She then, to his consternation, asks if he would give her drawing lessons. Piro, flustered, agrees, and promptly forgets about them.\nEarlier in the story, Piro had seen Nanasawa Kimiko at an Anna Miller's restaurant, where she is a waitress, after Tsubasa brought him and Largo there. Later on, Piro encounters Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and railcard. Piro hands her his own railcard and walks off before she can refuse his offer. This event causes Kimiko to develop an idealized vision of her benefactor, an image which is shattered the next time they meet. Despite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is too shy to admit them. Later on in the story, Kimiko's outburst on a radio talk show causes her to suddenly rise to idol status. Angered by the hosts' derisive comments about fanboys, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration. Later, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up her skirt. Piro works undercover as a busboy to get rid of all cameras. The scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and lifts her skirt in defiance, and they take photographs. Piro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos. On the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.\nMeanwhile, Largo develops a relationship with Hayasaka Erika, Piro's coworker at Megagamers.  She and Kimiko share a house. As with Piro and Kimiko, Largo and Erika meet by coincidence early in the story. Later, it is revealed that Erika is a former pop idol, who caused a big scene then disappeared from the public eye after her fianc\u00e9 left her. When she is rediscovered by her fans, Largo helps thwart a fanboy horde, but not well enough to escape being dismissed by the TPCD for it.  He then offers to help Erika to deal with her \"vulnerabilities in the digital plane\".  Erika insists on protecting herself, so Largo instructs her in computer-building. This leads into a little more relationship than Largo can handle, partly because he insists all computer building be done in the nude or as close to it as possible, to avoid static electrical discharge ruining components, and partly because his behavior, crude though it may appear, impresses Erika in many ways.\nThe enigmatic Tohya Miho frequently meddles in the lives of the protagonists. Miho knows Piro and Largo from the Endgames MMORPG previous to Megatokyo's plot. She abused a hidden statistic in the game to gain control of nearly all of the game's player characters, but was ultimately defeated by Piro and Largo.  In the comic, Miho becomes close friends with Ping, influencing Ping's relationship with Piro and pitting Ping against Largo in video game battles. Miho is also involved in Erika's backstory; Miho manipulated Erika's fans after Erika's disappearance. This effort ended badly, leaving Miho hospitalized, and the TPCD cleaning up the aftermath. Most of the exact details of what happened are left to the readers' imagination, as are her current motivations and ultimate goal.  Miho and many of the events surrounding her involve a club in Harajuku, the Cave of Evil (CoE).\nAfter getting yelled at for retaining her waitress job, Kimiko quits her voice acting job and goes home to find Erika assembling a new computer in her undergarments.  Not long after Erika tells Kimiko to strip, Piro comes by, who she tells to get undressed as well.  While Erika and Piro talk about her, Kimiko, who hid when Piro showed up, runs out of the apartment.  Kimiko runs into Ping, who wanted to talk to Piro about why, after an explosion at school, she had started to cry uncontrollably.  They encounter Largo at the store, who explains what went wrong, although no one knows what he means until Piro comes in and translates.  Ping is relieved to know that she won't shut down and Kimiko hugs Piro and apologizes for her actions.  Largo leaves for Erika's apartment after she calls looking for help.  That night, while Piro and Kimiko fall asleep watching TV, Erika, who finished the computer with Largo's help, tries to seduce Largo, but it freaks him out and he runs out for home.  The next morning, after Kimiko departs, Piro finds out she quit her voice acting job and tries to find her.\nKimiko and Miho are in the same diner, to which Ed has sent an attack robot (Kill-Bot) against Miho, since she has disrupted his attempts to destroy Ping. Miho is in the diner trying to contact Piro, Kimiko is talking with Erika. Dom is also there to talk with Kimiko.  After rescuing both herself and Kimiko from the Kill-Bot and chaos at the diner, the two talk about things. Miho talks to Piro on her phone, argues with him, and then Piro and Kimiko have a conversation about that as the two females are leaving the area. Dom follows and tries to coerce Kimiko into joining SEGA for protection from fans, but she refuses. Drained, she has Miho finish talking to Piro on the phone.  Piro then encounters a group who found Kimiko's cell phone and other belongings after she and Miho escaped the diner. The group wants to help Piro get together with Kimiko, partially due to feeling bad for trying to snap a picture up Kimiko's skirt. Piro and the group set out for a press conference Kimiko is going to for the voice acting project, Sight. Besides all of the other fans going to the event, a planned zombie outbreak occurs in the area. Miho, who helped Kimiko get ready for the event and accompanied her to it, later calls the zombies off for unexplained reasons through an unexplained mechanism.\nLargo and Yuki, who has since been revealed along the way to be a magical girl like her mother Meimi (likewise revealed), steal a Rent-a-Zilla to fight the zombie outbreak.  Largo leaves Yuki to help Piro get to Kimiko.  Unfortunately, the Rent-a-Zilla gets bitten by zombies and turns into one itself, resulting in the TPCD capturing it.  Yuki protects it from the TPCD, teleports it out of the area, and adopts it as a pet in a miniaturized form, all much to her father's chagrin.\nAfter the event, Erika, Largo, Kimiko and Piro are reunited, and they talk a bit with Miho, who has shown up again after storming out following an argument with Kenji earlier.  Miho declines an offer to eat with the group and wanders off thinking about games and Largo and Piro.  She is shown walking amongst the zombies and then in Ed's gun-sights, and in the center of an attack by a number of Ed's Kill-Bots.\nDuring the next nine days, Piro and Kimiko have made up and Kimiko returned to both of her jobs, with them seeing little of each other.  Largo and Erika are shown to likewise be involved but more often, including going to dinner with the Sonoda family, as the inspector's brother was Erika's fianc\u00e9.  Kimiko is attempting to get Piro working as an artist on Sight, which unbeknownst to them is now being funded by Dom.  Ping is concerned about the whereabouts of Miho, who hasn't been seen during the time, but Piro is still upset about all that has happened and somewhat evasively refuses direct assistance.  Ping and Junko, another one of Largo's students, who used to be a friend of Miho, work towards finding Miho.  Yuki and Kobayashi Yutaka then also become involved with the attempt because of this.  That night, Piro and Kimiko discuss Miho and Endgames, which Yuki overhears, they unaware she is there.  This leads Yuki to appropriate Piro's powerless laptop and leave, believing him to still be in love with Miho and that the device might hold clues to finding her.  Kimiko and Piro work on his portfolio for Sight and then they say goodnight and leave.  He returns to his apartment, but Kimiko goes to the CoE club using a pass Miho gave her long ago in the beginning.  Once at the club, Dom mockingly advises her, Yuki unknowingly whisps past her, and she unexpectedly meets up with an old friend Komugiko.  During all this, Piro has left his apartment after looking at his sketchbook and a drawing of Miho.  His current location is unknown.\nAside from Kimiko, concurrent overlapping events have led to almost every main character converging upon the club for various reasons involving Miho, or in support of others involved. Ed, attempting to destroy Ping, fights with Largo, as the staff of the club have maneuvered Ed and Ping into the protective radius of ex-Idol Erika.  Yuki and Yutaka get Piro's laptop powered on, she reads the old chat logs between Piro and Miho, and follows instructions from her to him.  Going to a \"hidden-in-plain-sight\" hospital room, she finds Miho alive and well, although seemingly in a weakened state. During a heated argument and Miho's goading, Yuki then forcibly moves Miho to the club. Shortly after the arrival of the two in the center of everyone, the bulk of the denizens go into trance-like states while others are fighting or confused about what to do next. Miho appears to be collapsing. Upon instructions from Erika, Largo finds then uses his Largo-Phone and the club's sound system to knock out power in the immediate area of the club. During this event, Piro has gone to visit Miho at the \"hospital\" room, where he discovers that she is missing. Following the blackout, Largo, Erika, and Miho board a train, where Miho decides to return home. However, a large crowd has blocked her path home, apparently waiting for someone's return.\nThe next morning, Piro has been brought to jail, where he has been interrogated by police about Miho's disappearance. He is able to leave jail by paying a suspiciously set low bail of about $100 US, which is obtained through a 10,000 yen bill that has been shaped into an origami 'zilla and left in the cell.  Piro walks back home, where he finds Miho sleeping on a beanbag in the apartment.  Piro and Miho then work out some of the confusion between them, which reveals several background events.  She explains the Analogue Support Facility as a sort of safehouse, where she was able to come and go when she wanted. Since Ping in her extreme attempt to find Miho had posted tons of pictures, videos, and information on the internet, people are now using that to \"build a 'real' me\", as Miho explains it. During the process, at one point Kimiko calls from the studio, updating Piro on his artwork and telling him some of how last night she and others found Miho and how crazy it was.  Largo and Erika, who are riding on the roof of a train in the Miyagi prefecture also call during the conversation.  After a short conversation with both Largo and Erika on the phone, and a bit more conversation with Miho, Piro instructs her to stay in the apartment until they can figure out what to do.  Junko and Ping are shown leaving for school, with Junko seeming taking Ed's shotguns from last night with her.\nAfter receiving a phone call from Yutaka, whom Masamichi initially disapproves of, Yuki, who has not changed clothing from the events of the previous chapter, leaves her house, grabs him, and takes him to a rooftop, where they try to explain things after Yutaka was being questioned by Asako and Mami. She goes over everything, even why she referred to herself as a \"monster\", which Yuki's friends previously overheard and misunderstood. Realizing that Miho is the cause of this mess, Yutaka indirectly vows revenge, but Yuki stops him. Yutaka goes anyway and meets his brother in front of Megagamers, who has tracked Miho to the store since the previous night. Yutaka's brother is a member of a group of Nanasawa fans who plan to intervene and remind Piro who his true love is to get rid of Miho. However, Dom's van is blocking the store's entrance. Though Yuki protests against intervention to the group, Dom, who is unknown to them, performs his own method of intervention anyway and forces Piro to choose between Nanasawa and Miho.  It is currently unknown if Dom knows who Miho is, but Miho, in a disguise, overhears the conversation and forces Piro to briefly wear a hat. At the same time, Yuki, deciding that she can wait no longer, steals Dom's van and guns, and rushes into the store with Yutaka in tow. Seeing this, Miho grabs Piro and rushes upstairs, discarding the hat in the process. Yuki subsequently collides with the hat and a presumed explosion occurs, stalling Yuki and Yutaka. Miho and Piro don cosplay outfits as a disguise, escape, and make their way to the local bath house. Just before Yuki grabs Yutaka again, Dom, now trapped under a pile of rubble, expresses his condolences to Yutaka, to which he does not understand. The pair quickly follow Miho and Piro and await for them to leave the bath house.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Like its larger brother, the Wasp Junior was an air-cooled, nine-cylinder radial, with its power boosted by a gear-driven single-speed centrifugal type supercharger. Its cylinders were smaller, however, with a bore and stroke of 5+3\u204416 in (132 mm), giving a 27% lesser total displacement. The Wasp Junior used many parts from the Wasp and even had the same mounting dimensions, allowing an aircraft to easily use either the smaller or the larger engine. The first run of the Wasp Junior was in 1929, and sales began in 1930. The initial version, the Wasp Junior A, produced 300 hp (224 kW).The U.S. military designated the Wasp Junior as the R-985, with various suffixes denoting different military engine models. However, Pratt & Whitney never adopted the R-985 designation scheme for its civilian Wasp Juniors, identifying them simply by name and model (e.g. \"Wasp Junior A\").\nPratt & Whitney followed the Wasp Junior A with more powerful models in the \"A series\". These had higher compression ratios, greater RPM limits, and more effective supercharging, and they led to the \"B series\". The first B series model was the Wasp Junior TB, which could maintain 420 hp (310 kW) at sea level and could reach 440 hp (330 kW) for takeoff. The TB was tuned for best performance at sea level; it was soon joined by the Wasp Junior SB, which was tuned for best performance at altitude and could sustain 400 hp (300 kW) at altitudes up to 5,000 ft (1,500 m), with 450 hp (340 kW) available for takeoff.  A still later model, the Wasp Junior T1B2, had improved performance at low level, being able to sustain 450 hp (340 kW) up to 1,500 ft (460 m) while still matching the SB's power at high altitudes. The SB and T1B2, and later versions of these with similar performance, were the most popular Wasp Junior models. One later development of the T1B2, the Wasp Junior B4, was especially designed for vertical mounting in helicopters.During the mid-1930s, Pratt & Whitney developed a still greater improvement of the Wasp Junior, the \"C series\", with an even higher compression ratio and RPM limit. The only type produced in this series, the Wasp Junior SC-G, could sustain 525 hp (391 kW) at an altitude of 9,500 ft (2,900 m) and could produce 600 hp (450 kW) for takeoff. It also included reduction gearing to allow the high-revving engine to drive a propeller at suitable speeds, hence the \"-G\" suffix. Aviator Jacqueline Cochran flew a special Model D-17W Beechcraft Staggerwing with this engine in 1937, setting a speed and altitude record and placing third in the Bendix transcontinental race.

It would be rerun on GSN from 2004 to 2005. This new version was judged by four panelists, including Ben Stein, Naomi Judd, Ahmet Zappa and a rotating celebrity panelist (which in at least one case was McMahon himself). Among the winners were singer Tiffany Evans, comedian John Roy and singer Mark Mejia.\nThe revival consisted of four seasons. For the first season, the categories were Adult and Junior Singer, Comedy, and Modeling. In seasons two and three, Modeling was replaced with Dance. In the final season, the Comedy category was scrapped altogether and only the singing and dancing categories remained.\nFor the first three seasons, two new competitors faced off. The three house judges, along with the one celebrity judge, gave each contestant a score on a scale from one to five stars, making a maximum studio score 20 stars. During each commercial break, the home audience went to www.cbs.com/star to rate the competitors who just performed. Each performer could earn up to another 20 stars from the home audience. In the climactic moment before the score from the home audience was revealed, Hall would often say, \"Hit me with the digits!\"\nWhen the scores were tallied, the higher scoring performer won. If the score was tied, then Hall would read off each performer's score rounded to the nearest hundredth (the at-home score was initially rounded down to the nearest star, unless there was a tie). That performer would then go on to the next round of competition. The only real exception to this format during the first three seasons was that three people competed in the semi-final rounds, not two. After the first three seasons, a special, \"Battle of the Best\" show took place, where the three Adult Singer, Junior Singer, Comedian, and two Young Dancer Grand Champions (Modeling was only the first season, and Dance had only been around for two seasons) were brought back to face off for an additional $100,000.\nFor the fourth and final season, three contestants in Adult Singer, Junior Singer, and Dance were brought back to initially compete (Comedy was dropped, jokingly because Naomi gave many comics only one star). The three brought back in each category were not necessarily the Grand Champions of their season. The show scrapped the celebrity judge and had three house judges for the entire series: Naomi Judd, MC Lyte, and Matti Leshem (who tried to berate contestants as Simon Cowell was doing at the time on American Idol).\nAs in past seasons, two new contestants competed. With only three judges, a score of 15 stars was possible, and ties were broken by a majority vote between the three. This is where the former contestants came in. Initially, in each category, these three performers made up the \"Winner's Circle\". The winning challenger then had the chance to challenge one of the three performers in his or her respective winner's circle. The winner's circle performer then had to beat or tie the bar set by the challenger; ties were automatically given to the Winner's Circle performer. If they couldn't beat the score, they were out of the competition, and the challenger took his or her place in the Winner's Circle.\nHalfway through the program, the three performers in each Winner's Circle competed against each other in a special show. The winner in each category not only received a trip home, but a free pass to the final show. From then on, there were only two people who could be challenged in each Winner's Circle. In the final show, the three people in each Winner's Circle competed against each other for $100,000. This, along with the Free Pass show, were the only two shows which re-adopted the at-home voting concept.\n\nThe Adult Singer group was the only group to record a complete shutout. The three performers in the beginning were there in the end as well.\nThe free pass was equally important in the other two groups as well. In both the Dance and Junior Singer categories, not only did the free pass save the winner from being challenged in an ever-changing Winner's Circle, but they ended up winning their group finals (Junior Singer Mark Mejia and Dancer Jon Cruz).\nAdult Singer and season 1 champion Jake Simpson was challenged a record four times during his tenure in the Winner's Circle. He not only went a perfect 4\u20130, but he also won his group final. The only match he lost that entire season was the Winner's Circle Square-Off Special.At the same time, a spin-off called Star Search \u2013 Das Duell der Stars von Morgen was produced and aired in Germany, but with less success than the more popular show Deutschland sucht den Superstar, the German version of the Idol franchise.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The album was a commercial failure in both countries, reaching only number 99 on the American album charts and failing to chart altogether on the British Top 40. According to music journalist Peter Robinson, its failure stalled Springfield's career rather than revive it, although the record eventually became \"a popcultural milestone [and] timeless emotional reference point\" for listeners who discovered it in second-hand shops or purchased one of its several reissues years later. Robert Christgau called it \"a pop standard and classic\", predicting in his 1973 column for Newsday it would be \"the kind of record that will sell for years because its admirers need replacement copies, and it is the perfect instance of how a production team should work.\" Greil Marcus was less enthusiastic in Rolling Stone, deeming some of the songwriting inconsistent on what was \"a real drifting, cool, smart, sexually distracted soul album\".Despite modest sales (the platter has sold 216,000 in the United States in the SoundScan era, per Luminate Entertainment Data) it was the first of a small wave of \"in Memphis\"-style albums that were recorded by pop singers at American Recording Studios. Three months after Springfield's album was released, Dionne Warwick's Soulful album was released, which had a similar mix of soul and pop and was recorded at American. In the summer of 1969, Elvis Presley's From Elvis in Memphis was released, featuring Presley recording at American with The Memphis Boys musicians. The following year, Petula Clark's Memphis album, also recorded at American, was released. These albums were all part of a larger 1960s and 1970s boom of soul and pop music production in Memphis (home to Stax Records, Hi Records, and other studios and labels), and nearby Muscle Shoals, Alabama.\nDusty in Memphis has been named one of the great albums of all time. NME named it the 54th greatest album ever in their 1993 list, and it was voted number 171 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked the record 89th on the magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, a rating which the album maintained in a 2012 revised list, before rising to number 83 in a 2020 reboot of the list. According to Richie Unterberger of AllMusic, the album's reputation has improved significantly over time as the music is \"deserving of its classic status\". Tony Scherman from Entertainment Weekly wrote Dusty in Memphis is a \"pure gem\", Springfield's greatest work, and perhaps one of the great pop records recorded. Q took note of its balance between \"R&B and sensitive pop dramas\", and Spin critic Chuck Eddy viewed it as one of the all-important blue-eyed soul records. In The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps wrote that Springfield and her team of musicians and producers for Dusty in Memphis developed an elegant and distinct fusion of pop and R&B that predated the Philadelphia soul sound of the 1970s. According to Eric Klinger from PopMatters, its sophisticated style of music influenced the sound of 1990s trip hop artists who sampled songs from the album and became a blueprint for British female singers of the 2000s, including Adele, Amy Winehouse, Duffy, Joss Stone, Paloma Faith and Rumer.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The band liked Biggins enough to sign with the label. Between the end of recording England Made Me and its release, the Auteurs recorded How I Learned to Love the Bootboys (1999), which was influenced by the atmospheric nature of England Made Me. In February and March 1998, Black Box Recorder toured the UK.Chrysalis Records released England Made Me on 20 July 1998. The album's cover features a 1973 photograph of wrestler Adrian Street and his miner father taken by Dennis Hutchinson at Beynon's Colliery in Blaina, Wales. Haines said Street, who was cross-dressing, was showing off his championship belt while his father reproachfully stares at him. Haines said he and Moore used to watch wrestling when they were children until it \"got axed because it became too pantomime\". Hutchinson's photograph is included in Simon Garfield's book The Wrestling (1996); Garfield put the band in contact with Street to ask his permission to use the photograph for the album.

Rabidoux and Beadle were veterans of the local hardcore scene, and had broken away from their respective bands out of a need to try something new musically. Their initial plans were to find a vocalist and bassist, but after recruiting Frattini, decided to remain an instrumental trio.\nTheir style draws heavily upon 70s progressive rock, particularly King Crimson and Yes, as well as fusion, hardcore, and math rock.  Their first self-titled 3 song EP was released in 2001, consisting of 2 studio tracks and 1 live track. Their 9 song full-length debut The Audio Medium followed in 2002.  The album explored a number of sonic landscapes, and revolved around the concept of the corporate music industry's control of the masses; that people are sheep to what music corporations and radio stations tell them to listen to, unaware of the real music that exists out there.  As in the medical world, a \"cancer conspiracy\" that hides the cure for cancer for the purpose of making money from the sick.  The album booklet contained a letter from a doctor by the name of Dr. Travis John, who shared similar views and who warned the band of the trouble they were getting themselves into.\nThe band toured extensively with bandmates on their label Big Wheel Recreation, and also opened for Oysterhead's first tour. Their shows were sometimes augmented by video projections.  In 2003, while at a show in New York City, their van was stolen, along with all of their equipment.  This was the last and most disastrous in a series of mishaps that had plagued their tours.  They decided to call it a day in late 2003.  There were reports on the Big Wheel Recreation website that they were working on a second album, and songs have surfaced on P2P filesharing programs. The album is now being released by both Gilead and Radar Recordings, after years of legal issues surrounding the intellectual rights of the music.  The album, Omega, was released in January 2008.

Besides the Young Rascals, present in the studio were Brigati's older brother David, the producer Arif Mardin and the engineer Chris Huston, who had been chosen to attend the session by David, who had known Huston while himself a member of Joey Dee and the Starliters in the early 1960s.The structure of \"Groovin'\" was according to Cavaliere \"mapped out\" together with Mardin right before right before they entered the studio, with the decision of cutting the drums from the song haven been taken during that moment. Additionally, Cavaliere had opted not to play his standard instrument, the hammond organ, on the recording. Instead, he opted to play the piano on the recording; the Carmen Cavallaro-inspired lounge piano performance during the song's instrumental break was orchestraded by Mardin in order to give the recording \"a little bit more texture\". Cavaliere states that Mardin helped with a lot of the arrangement and production of the song, even though the Young Rascals themselves were contractually credited as the producers.The basic track of \"Groovin'\" was recorded by Cavaliere on vocals and piano, with Cornish on tambourine and Danelli playing a conga drum and woodblock. Cavaliere recalls that Danelli held the woodblock sticks under his arms while playing the conga, before using it to hit a wood block taped to the conga drum, creating a \"ticking beat that sounded like a clock you ignored on a beautiful Sunday afternoon\". Following the basic track's completion, Cavaliere overdubbed vibes and Cornish guitar while the Brigati brothers added their backing vocals. Though Cornish tried to overdub the song's bass line, he was unable to get precisely what Cavaliere had envisioned, so instead they called in session musician Chuck Rainey to perform the bass duties on the song. With time running out in the studio, Huston used one of Talentmaster's janitors, a local musician named Michael Weinstein, to overdub the harmonica performance of the song. Cornish would return to the studio a few weeks later to overdub his harmonica performance; this would be used for the stereo mix of the song.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This scene was well known while the film was popular, and viewers at the time likely recognized Bugs Bunny's behavior as parody.\nIn January 1937, Gable was honored with a block in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre.\nIn the 1937 film Broadway Melody of 1938, Judy Garland (aged 15) sings \"You Made Me Love You\" while looking at a composite picture of Gable. The opening lines are: \"Dear Mr Gable, I am writing this to you, and I hope that you will read it so you'll know, my heart beats like a hammer, and I stutter and I stammer, every time I see you at the picture show, I guess I'm just another fan of yours, and I thought I'd write and tell you so. You made me love you, I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to do it ...\"The 1948 Cole Porter tune \"Always True to You in My Fashion\" contains the lyrics \"Mister Gable, I mean Clark / Wants me on his boat to park\".\nThe 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail contained a reference to impersonating Gable in the song performed by the Knights of the Round Table.\nThe 2003 music album Give Up by The Postal Service has a song titled \"Clark Gable\". The singer wants to \"find a love that looks and sounds like a movie\", and includes the lyric, \"I kissed you in a style Clark Gable would have admired, I thought it classic\".\nGable has been portrayed in a number of films. Actors who have played the role include: Phillip Waldron in It Happened in Hollywood (1937), James Brolin in Gable and Lombard (1976), Larry Pennell in Marilyn: The Untold Story (1980), Edward Winter in Moviola: The Scarlett O'Hara War (1980), Boyd Holister in Grace Kelly (1983), Gary Wayne in Malice in Wonderland (1985), Gene Daily in The Rocketeer (1991), Bobby Valentino in RKO 281 (1999), Bruce Hughes and Shayne Greenman in Blonde (2001), and Charles Unwin in Lucy (2003).\nIn Drunk History Season 3 2015 Miami episode 2, Josh Hartnett portrays Gable.

{"id": "175_463", "question": "Who performed In the Mood?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_53913", "text": "The Deep was an American psychedelic rock band made up of musicians from New York City, who in 1966 traveled to Philadelphia to record a one-time LP, Psychedelic Moods.  The band was experimentally progressive, as they were one of the earliest groups to record psychedelic music, before it was adapted by a wider array of musical acts.  Although their only album failed to achieve success, it later gained acclaim for being considered the earliest work to reference \"psychedelic\" in its title.Information on the band is sparse as only one band member had a confirmed musical career prior to recording. The member, Rusty Evans (born Marcus Uzilevsky, 1937, New York City, died December 5, 2015, Woodacre, California), was the Deep's lead guitarist, primary songwriter, and a vocalist.  Evans initially recorded in 1958 as a rockabilly singer, before performing as a Greenwich Village folk musician in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  He recorded three albums as Rusty Evans \u2013 Songs of Our Land, Railroad Songs (both 1964) and Live at Gerde's Folk City (1965) \u2013 and was later a member of the folk group The New Christy Minstrels. Musician David Bromberg is also known to have played on The Deep's one and only album, although it is unknown on which tracks he played.In the early summer of 1966, Evans convinced producer Mark Barkan to help him record a psychedelic album.  They secured arrangements with the Philadelphia-based Cameo-Parkway label, the home for fellow protopunk act Question Mark and the Mysterians, for a meager budget of $1200.  In August, Evans and Barkan assembled a group of New York musicians to record as the Deep, and they drove in a rundown car to Philadelphia to record what would become the Psychedelic Moods album, which was done in the short period of four days and would necessitate late-night sessions in order to be finished on time.  The all-night sessions also provided the musicians, who were unable to afford a hotel, with a place to sleep.While the exact release date of the album has yet to be definitively established, the record is generally considered to have been distributed in October 1966, based on the album's catalogue number. This would credit it as the first official album to include the word \"psychedelic\" in its title, pre-dating the Blues Magoos' debut, Psychedelic Lollipop, and The 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. The Deep's Psychedelic Moods did not sell well, and the group did not tour to support it. They existed as a studio-only band, and, aside from sessions for their album, produced no other recordings under that name.Evans left Cameo-Parkway to record a new album for the Columbia Records label in 1967. Abandoning the \"Deep\" name, this second album was credited to the band The Freak Scene and entitled Psychedelic Psoul. Despite the name change, the band still contained the original lineup from the first album, and the sound of this album is very similar to that of Psychedelic Moods. It is typically considered a follow-up in all but name. As its title suggests, Psychedelic Psoul is composed of psychedelic-influenced tracks as the band continued to develop past concepts from their debut album. However, The Freak Scene's album met the same results as Psychedelic Moods. They did not tour, and their album did not chart. The album has been rereleased by Sony BMG through Columbia Records on vinyl. The group disbanded in late 1967.After this venture, Evans returned to performing as a solo musician. He recorded under his birthname, Marcus, for a self-titled album in 1969, which produced compositions conceived as psychedelic folk in nature. He did not record another album until 1979, when he released Life's Railway Heaven, another folk effort. Evans recorded sporadically until his death, usually in the style of folk or rockabilly music,  and in the 1990s released two new age CDs, Slice of Light and Gypsy Dreams, credited as Uzca.  He also led a Johnny Cash tribute band.  Under his real name of Marcus Uzilevsky, he was a respected visual artist best known for his landscape paintings, and was exhibited widely in California.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

The band wrote many of the songs during soundchecks on its Vs. Tour, and the majority of the album's tracks were recorded during breaks on the tour. The first session took place late in 1993 in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the band recorded \"Tremor Christ\" and \"Nothingman\". The rest of the material was written and recorded in 1994 in sessions in Seattle, Washington and Atlanta, Georgia, with the band finishing the album at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle after the tour's completion. \"Immortality\" was written in April 1994 when the band was on tour in Atlanta. Sources state that most of the album was completed by early 1994, but it was not released until November due to either a forced delay by Epic or the band's battle with ticket vendor Ticketmaster.Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by the time they were working on Vitalogy. Producer Brendan O'Brien said: \"Vitalogy was a little strained. I'm being polite\u2014there was some imploding going on.\" Bassist Jeff Ament said that \"communication was at an all-time low\". Drummer Dave Abbruzzese stated that the communication problems started once guitarist Stone Gossard stopped acting as the band's mediator. According to Gossard, Vitalogy was the first album for which lead vocalist Eddie Vedder made the final decisions. At the time, Gossard thought of quitting the band. Gossard said the band was having trouble collaborating, so most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. He added that \"80 percent of the songs were written 20 minutes before they were recorded.\" During the production of Vitalogy, lead guitarist Mike McCready went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for alcohol and cocaine abuse.Drums on \"Satan's Bed\" were performed by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On the day it was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as \"Jimmy\". Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for Vitalogy, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with other band members. Gossard said: \"It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason, his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled.\" Jack Irons, the original drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\".

The single was then included on four of the singer's concert tours: Virgin (1985), Who's That Girl (1987), Confessions (2006), and Rebel Heart (2015\u20132016). On the first one, Madonna wore a black crop top beneath a vest with a silver cross patt\u00e9e, matching fringed gloves and miniskirt, leggings, low-heeled leather boots, and a crucifix earring in one ear. The performance of the song at Detroit's Cobo Arena was included on the Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour video release (1985).\nThe song's performance at the Who's That Girl World Tour found the artist singing underneath a disco ball hung from above the stage. She wore the same black bustier from her \"Open Your Heart\" (1987) video, with her platinum blonde hair done in a big bushy style. From the Chicago Tribune, Scott A. Zamost and Elizabeth Snead felt that, although Madonna's voice sounded strong, she was \"drowned out frequently and annoyingly by an overpowering back-up band\" in numbers such as \"Lucky Star\". Two different performances can be found on the videos Who's That Girl: Live in Japan and Ciao Italia: Live from Italy, filmed in Tokyo on June and in Turin on September, respectively.A \"modernized\" \"Lucky Star\" with a techno beat was sung on the Confessions Tour. Following the performance of \"La Isla Bonita\" (1987), Madonna lies face-down on the stage; afterwards, two backup singers wrap an illuminated white cape with \"Dancing Queen\" embroidered on the back around her and, together, proceed to perform \"Lucky Star\". Towards the end, the original beat of the song slowly begins to morph into \"Hung Up\" (2005), the concert's final number. From The Providence Journal, Rick Massimo opined the song was given \"even more dance thump\". The performance from the August 15-16 London concerts was included on the singer's second live album, The Confessions Tour (2007).On the MDNA Tour (2012), the song was sampled on a video that led to \"Turn Up the Radio\".

Sanjaya and Vidura joined them in Vyasa's hermitage. \nOne year later the Pandavas went to meet with them. On seeking Vidura, Yudhishthira found him performing rigorous tapasya deep in the forest; without his uttering a word,  energy left Vidura's body and entered that of Yudhishthira, after which Vidura fell dead. When he tried to cremate the corpse an invisible voice prevented the king from doing so. Vyasa then told him how Vidura was an incarnation of Dharma, the god of righteousness, born in the mortal world through the curse of Mandavya. \nVyasa understanding the sorrow of Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti offered them a glimpse of their sons and relatives who died at Kurukshetra. The  spirits of the slain then rose from the waters of the Bhagirathi, with Vyasa offering the blind Dhritarashtra celestial vision for beholding those heroes. The five Pandavas met Karna, Abhimanyu, and the sons of Draupadi. After some time that large ghostly host disappeared and went to their respective regions. \nOn hearing the story the sceptical Janamejaya asked Vyasa to prove the veracity of the tale, upon which Vyasa summoned Parikshit. The Pandavas, at Dhritarashtra's own request, then returned to Hastinapura.\nTwo years later, Narada informed Yudhishthira that Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti had willingly perished in a forest-fire, after ordering Sanjaya to escape. Narada consoled the grieving Pandavas by telling that their aged relatives had found peace in the abodes of the gods. Yudhishthira then performed their \u015bhraddha.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Pictures, produced by Harry Joe Brown and Gordon Hollingshead (with Hal B. Wallis as executive producer), directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, and Ross Alexander. With a screenplay by Casey Robinson, the film is based on the 1922 novel Captain Blood by Rafael Sabatini and concerns an imprisoned doctor and his fellow prisoners who escape their cruel island captivity to become West Indies pirates. An earlier 1924 Vitagraph silent film version of Captain Blood starred J. Warren Kerrigan as Peter Blood. Warner Bros. risked pairing two relatively unknown performers in the lead roles. Flynn's performance made him a major Hollywood star and established him as the natural successor to Douglas Fairbanks and a \"symbol of an unvanquished man\" during the Great Depression. Captain Blood also established de Havilland, in just her fourth screen appearance, as a major star and was the first of eight films costarring Flynn and de Havilland. In 1938 they would be reunited with Rathbone in The Adventures of Robin Hood. The same year, Rathbone also starred with Flynn in The Dawn Patrol.

Each distributor markets products directly to potential customers and can also recruit and train customers to become distributors. Distributors are paid from the retail markup on products they are able to sell personally, as well as a performance bonus based on the sales of distributors they have recruited. In the early 1990s, Nu Skin was investigated by the states of Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan over allegations of misleading marketing practices. In 1992 the company settled with five of these states, admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to pay the states' investigative costs, refund disgruntled distributors, and revamp its promotional practices. The Connecticut Attorney General did not agree to those terms and sued Nu Skin, charging the company with misleading its distributors and operating a pyramid scheme. Nu Skin admitted to no wrongdoing or violation of law and paid Connecticut $85,000 for consumer-protection programs as part of a settlement.In 1997, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania sued Nu Skin, alleging that the company operated a pyramid scheme through a subsidiary, QIQ Connections. The Attorney General's office alleged that distributors paid for the right to market technology services that did not, in fact, exist. Nu Skin discontinued the QIQ subsidiary, allowing those who had paid QIQ to transition to Big Planet, another Nu Skin interest marketing Internet technology. The president of Big Planet described the pyramid scheme as a matter of \"a few distributors who in their enthusiasm have been overzealous in some of their marketing activities.\"In 2010, Nu Skin was listed among Forbes \"100 Most Trustworthy Companies\".In 2012, Stanford University apologized for any \"misunderstanding\" following a cease and desist letter sent to halt the use of the name of one of its researchers, Dr. Stuart Kim, in Nu Skin's advertising. Also in 2012, Citron Research issued a report \"stating that Nu Skin's sales model on mainland China, the fastest growing market in direct-selling, amounted to an illegal multilevel marketing scheme.\" Nu Skin dismissed the claims, calling its sales model in China \"kosher\" and stating that it had no plans to change its business model in China. In 2014, The Chinese government investigated Nu Skin following a People's Daily newspaper report calling it a \"suspected illegal pyramid scheme.\" Following the investigation, the Chinese government fined Nu Skin for $540,000 due to illegal sales and making false product claims.In February 2014, a securities fraud class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah against Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of the company during the period from July 10, 2013, to January 16, 2014.In a Last Week Tonight with John Oliver segment that covered multilevel marketing companies, Oliver criticized Nu Skin for the fact that in 2015, 93% of its distributors did not earn a commission check in a typical month.

She appeared shortly after at the top of the staircase wearing a hot pink vinyl tube top and white vinyl pants with pink knee patches. During the 2000 leg of the tour, entitled Crazy 2k Tour, Spears changed the opening sequence of the show; the show started with a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang.

She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\", which included a chair dance sequence referencing Janet Jackson's \"Miss You Much\" music video that ended with Spears saying \"Is that the end?\", quoting Jackson's phrase from the video.

J. Lawson in 1896, which set up its manufacturing base in Coventry. The company bought the right to the use of the Daimler name simultaneously from Gottlieb Daimler and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft of Cannstatt, Germany. After early financial difficulty and a reorganisation of the company in 1904, the Daimler Motor Company was purchased by Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) in 1910, which also made cars under its own name before the Second World War. In 1933, BSA bought the Lanchester Motor Company and made it a subsidiary of the Daimler Company.\nDaimler was awarded a Royal Warrant to provide cars to the British monarch in 1902; it lost this privilege in the 1950s after being supplanted by Rolls-Royce. Daimler occasionally used alternative technology: the Daimler-Knight engine which it further developed in the early twentieth century and used from 1909 to 1935, the worm gear final drive fitted from 1909 until after the Second World War, and their patented fluid flywheel used in conjunction with a Wilson preselector gearbox from 1930 to the mid-1950s.\nDaimler tried to widen its appeal in the 1950s with a line of smaller cars at one end and opulent show cars at the other, stopped making Lanchesters, had a highly publicised removal of their chairman from the board, and developed and sold a sports car and a high-performance luxury saloon and limousine. BSA sold Daimler to Jaguar Cars in 1960, and Jaguar briefly continued Daimler's line adding a Daimler variant of its Mark II sports saloon. Jaguar was then merged into the British Motor Corporation in 1966 and British Leyland in 1968. Under these companies, Daimler became an upscale trim level for Jaguar cars except for the 1968\u20131992 Daimler DS420 limousine, which had no Jaguar equivalent despite being fully Jaguar-based. When Jaguar Cars was split off from British Leyland in 1984, it retained the Daimler company and brand.\nFord bought Jaguar Cars in 1990 and under Ford it stopped using the Daimler marque in 2009 when the last X358 Daimler models were discontinued. The X351 Jaguar XJ took its place and there was no Daimler variant. Jaguar Cars remained in its ownership, and from 2000 accompanied by Land Rover, until they sold both Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors in 2008, who formed Jaguar Land Rover as a subsidiary holding company for them. In 2013, Jaguar Cars was merged with Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover Limited, and the rights to the Daimler car brand were transferred to the newly formed British multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover.", "hasanswer": false}]}

These include Millfields Community School in Hackney, Eastlea Community School in Newham and Trinity School in Barking and Dagenham. A total of 110 days of rehearsals took place in Dagenham. The ceremony had an adult volunteer cast of over 3,000 people, along with over 100 children and over 100 professional performers. Among the professional performers were 73 deaf and disabled performers and among the volunteers were 68 people with disabilities. In the build-up to the opening ceremony, an eight-week circus skills training programme took place at The Circus Space in Hoxton, London, and was run by 50 specialist performers. Participants included professional artists and many people who were new to the arts scene, such as soldiers undergoing rehabilitation and non-competing disabled athletes. The programme was funded by Arts Council England, and was part of the Enlightenment section, performing on a 35-metre high platform above the stadium floor.Stephen Daldry commenting on the ceremonies of London 2012 noted that \"if Danny Boyle's [Olympics opening ceremony] was very much about two revolutions and popular culture and Kim Gavin's [Olympics closing ceremony] was very much about a symphony of British music, then what you will get from Jenny and Bradley is something very different.\" Daldry also stated that \"there will be an extraordinary number of disabled performers in the cast.\" Sealey introduced Stephen Hawking as the \"most famous disabled person alive\" who will narrate \"the most exquisite journey,\" focusing on science and culture of the 18th century. As with the Olympics opening ceremony, The Tempest featured heavily and the character Miranda from the story starred in the ceremony, being the eyes for the audience. Sealey said that the character \"sees everybody but she doesn't judge. That is fundamental to our personal and political ethos,\" adding that it is \"fundamental, [that] you look without judging. It's about removing those attitudinal barriers.\" Sealey said that it was pure coincidence that she and Hemmings had chosen a line from the same play that was used by Boyle in the opening ceremony of the Olympics. \"When we found out Danny Boyle was going to reference Shakespeare's The Tempest we burst out laughing.\" Hemming, when comparing the Games to the Large Hadron Collider, said that the LHC \"transforms our perception of our place in the universe in the same way that the Paralympics transforms our perception of what's possible,\" while Sebastian Coe said that the ceremony would be a \"great showcase of the skills and excellence of disabled artists.\"Sealey and Hemming were determined to \"pay tribute to the contributions that science has made to the able bodied and impaired alike.\" The pair approached Hawking in late 2011, who was adamant that he would write his own part. Hawking commented on his role that \"to use this stage to show the world that regardless of differences between individuals, there is something that everyone is good at, is very important.\" Sealey and Hemming worked closely with Hawking to develop a series of messages for the ceremony and spent time with him in Cambridge; Hemming said Hawking had been \"incredibly gratified with him giving his time.\" Sealey said that although the ceremony has Hawking and Ian McKellen narrating, \"what we all need to remember: don't just look down at your feet, look at the stars, be curious.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The air temperature was 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) and the track temperature was 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F); conditions were expected to remain consistent throughout the race. Most of the frontrunners began the race on the harder compound tyre; only Massa was using the softer option. The attendance on the day of the Grand Prix was 105,000 people. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen accelerated faster than Hamilton off the line, getting ahead of him down the first straight, but the McLaren driver pulled into the Ferrari's slipstream, before swerving to overtake R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen in the inside of the corner. Going into the first corner, Hamilton badly locked-up his front wheels while braking and ran wide; although there was no contact, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was also forced wide in avoidance. This was then followed by contact with Kovalainen, which  finally forced  R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen off the track. All three drivers dropped back down the field as a result of the incident. Kubica took the lead ahead of Alonso and Kovalainen after the corner, avoiding collisions as other cars locked their tyres on the cold track. Fisichella drove into the back of Barrichello, scattering carbon fibre over the track. Coulthard collided with Bourdais and then Piquet, sustaining suspension damage and sliding into the barriers after turn two. Nakajima left the track trying to avoid Coulthard, although he managed to rejoin after losing his front wing. The Japanese driver made a pit stop at the end of the lap for a new wing.\nAt the end of the first lap, Kubica led from Alonso, Kovalainen, Trulli, Massa, Hamilton and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. On lap two, Massa braked late into the chicane at turn 10, briefly letting Hamilton past, before running over the kerbs on the exit from the corner and hitting the McLaren driver's car. Hamilton was spun round by the contact and made a pit stop at the end of the lap for new tyres and more fuel, which dropped him to 18th place. Massa continued in seventh place. On lap eight R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen passed Trulli into turn 10 to take fourth position. In third place, more than a second ahead of the Ferrari driver, Kovalainen set a new fastest lap of 1:19.258 on lap 12 to which R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen responded with a 1:19.193 four laps later. Two more drivers joined Coulthard in retirement before the first round of fuel stops: Glock made a pit stop on lap five and again on lap six, before retiring because of handling difficulties resulting from a broken seat fixing; Sutil retired on lap nine with a puncture caused by running over carbon fibre shards.On lap 17, Massa and Hamilton were given drive-through penalties, Massa for colliding with Hamilton and Hamilton for forcing R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen off the track into turn one. Hamilton took his penalty immediately. Massa made a pit stop for fuel and tyres on the next lap, before coming into the pit lane again on lap 20 to serve his penalty, which dropped him to 14th place, one place ahead of Hamilton. Meanwhile, Kubica and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen made pit stops on lap 17 for tyres and fuel. On the same lap, Kovalainen pulled over to the side of the track with engine problems and retired from the race. Alonso made a pit stop on lap 18, emerging ahead of Kubica to take the provisional lead, with cars in front still to pit. Trulli, Vettel and Bourdais made pit stops over the following six laps. Fisichella retired from the race with gearbox problems on lap 21. Piquet took his first pit stop on lap 28, emerging ahead of Bourdais as Alonso opened the gap on Kubica to 7.8 seconds. Massa overtook Button to take 12th position one lap later.\nAlonso lapped consistently in the low 1:19 range, setting the new fastest lap of the race on lap 41, a 1:19.101, to extend his lead over Kubica to more than 12 seconds. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was five seconds behind Kubica in third. Alonso made a pit stop for the second time on lap 43 and changed to the softer compound tyre. Kubica, complaining of understeer over the team radio, made his second stop on lap 46, two laps ahead of R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Piquet made pit stops over the next five laps, their teams giving them sufficient fuel to finish the race. As Bourdais exited the pit-lane in seventh place on lap 51, Massa, who was eighth, but yet to make his final pit stop, attempted to pass him and the two cars collided at the first corner. Massa spun, but rejoined the race behind Bourdais. Three laps later, the stewards announced that they were investigating the incident, and would make their decision after the race. On lap 52, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen attempted to pass Kubica on the approach to turn one after drafting behind him up the straight, but Kubica drove right as a blocking manoeuvre, braked late, and defended his position. On the following lap Kubica attempted to replicate his block, but R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen out-braked him into turn one, and the two drew alongside. Kubica held the inside line on the turn three left-hander, and drove the racing line as R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen left the track at the run-off area. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen then rejoined behind the BMW driver. Kubica faced similar challenges from R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen over the next two laps into turn one, but he successfully defended his position.\nMassa made a pit stop on lap 53, and rejoined behind Heidfeld in tenth. He subsequently set the fastest lap of the race on lap 55, a 1:18.426. Meanwhile, Piquet was able to close the gap on R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen to under a second, before losing time by running wide at turn five on lap 60. Massa passed Heidfeld for ninth on the same lap, and began closing in on Webber. On lap 65, Massa drafted down the straight and attempted to pass Webber, who defended his position by driving to the right. Crossing the track boundary into the end of the pit-lane, Massa managed to pass Webber, and out-braked him into turn one, to take eighth place. Alonso crossed the finish line on lap 67 to take his second win of the season, five seconds ahead of Kubica. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was third, ahead of Piquet, Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Massa. Webber took ninth on the line, ahead of Heidfeld, who struggled with a heavy car and failed to improve on a poor qualifying performance. Rosberg finished in front of Hamilton, in 11th.

In Barker's letter to Dunlop, he writes the performance was done as a benefit for Mr. Bray (who also played the role of Walter). However, other sources suggest it was a benefit for a Mrs. Woodham. In any case, it is clear that the performance was interrupted by an offstage commotion which may have cut the performance short. Mr. Webster, a tenor who played the role of Larry, was an object of public scorn at the time because of his effeminate manner and dress, and audience members rioted in outrage at his participation, causing Barker himself to order the curtain to be dropped. The play was subsequently performed again in Philadelphia on February 1, 1809, although it was advertised for January 25.There is some discrepancy about the date of the New York premiere, which took place at The Park Theatre, either on June 14, 1808, or on January 14, 1809, as a benefit for English actress Mrs. Lipman. It was performed again in New York as a benefit for Dunlop on June 23, 1809, There was a performance benefiting Bray and an actor named Mr. Cone advertised for August 25, 1808, at The Alexandria Theatre in Virginia. There was also a gala premiere on an unspecified date in Baltimore. Barker wrote in his letter to Dunlop that the play was subsequently and frequently performed in all the theatres across the country.  It was the standard practice in all these productions for the Native American roles to be played by white actors wearing dark makeup.The Indian Princess has been cited as the first well-documented case of a play that was originally performed in America being subsequently staged in England. Although records indicate there was a play called Pocahontas; or the Indian Princess, credited as being adapted by T.A. Cooper, that played The Theatre Royal at Drury Lane in London on December 15, 1820, and subsequently on December 16 and December 19, the piece differed drastically from Barker's original and featured a completely different cast of characters. Barker himself wrote that the production was done without his permission or even his knowledge, and based on a critical response he read of the London performance, he deduced that there was very little in the play that was his own. Other evidence suggests that the script used in England was not only a completely different play, but that it was likely not even originated by an American. This assertion is based primarily on three factors: the kinder and meeker portrayal of the Natives, which reduces the grandeur of the play's American heroes, the more vague listing of the setting as \"North America\" rather than specifically \"Virginia,\" and the lack of implications about America's great destiny that was evident in Barker's version. The distinction between the London and American versions is also supported by a review of the London production, in which the reviewer cites a lack of comic characters (Barker's version included several), and the presence of a character named \"Opechancaough,\" who is nowhere to be found in Barker's play.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jacobs, in his book Wild years: the music and myth of Tom Waits, describes \"Romeo is Bleeding\" as depicting \"a guy who sticks a shiv into the local sheriff [and] is fatally shot in the chest \u2014 a familiar Waits image, with echoes of West Side Story\". Waits had more overtly referenced West Side Story earlier on Blue Valentine album, with his cover of \"Somewhere\". According to Waits, the song is based on a real incident in Los Angeles, and concerns \"a Mexican gang leader who was shot and died in a movie house in downtown L.A.\"Music critic Adrian Denning wrote that \"one song that would, could and SHOULD rank amongst [Waits'] finest moments is the fabulous Jazz swing and late night seedy feel of 'Romeo is Bleeding.'\" While lukewarm towards Blue Valentine in general, Denning remarked that the song \"corrects matters somewhat,\" citing the song's \"great vocals and... bass groove.\" Robert Christgau wrote that \"Romeo is Bleeding\" was \"easily my favorite among his Chandleroid sagas of tragedy outside the law,\" but added that it is \"more effective on the jacket than when he [Waits] underlines its emotional resonance in song.\" Patrick Humphries, in The many lives of Tom Waits, was unimpressed, labeling the song a \"rewrite\" of Waits' 1976 song \"Small Change.\" The song later lent its name to the Peter Medak film Romeo Is Bleeding, starring Gary Oldman.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The actors fell in, the photography fell in and the story clicked. I caught a lot of breaks!\"The film was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. Match Point broke a streak of box office flops for Allen: it earned $85,306,374 worldwide, of which $23,151,529 was in its North American run. Allen was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.The film received generally strong reviews from critics, particularly in the United States. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 77% based on 216 reviews with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"Woody Allen's sharpest film in years, Match Point is a taut, philosophical thriller about class and infidelity.\" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 72 out of 100, and thus \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 40 professional critics. Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars, and considered it among the four best Allen films. He described it as having a \"terrible fascination that lasts all the way through\". Empire magazine gave the film four stars out of five, calling it Allen's best of his last half a dozen films, and recommended it even to those who are not fans of the director.Reviewers in the United Kingdom were generally less favorable. Philip French, writing in The Observer, criticized Allen's grasp of British idiom and the film's lack of humor, especially considering that two comic actors from the UK were cast in minor roles. Also, he called the dialogue \"rather lumbering\" and said that \"the lexicons of neither the City financier nor the London constable are used convincingly.\" Tim Robey, writing in The Daily Telegraph, disdained the claim that the film was Allen's return to form. Although he acknowledged that the consensus was stronger this time, he called it \"as flat-footed a movie as Allen has ever made, a decent idea scuppered by a setting \u2013 London \u2013 which he treats with the peculiarly tin-eared reverence of a visitor who only thinks he knows his way around.\" He called Johansson's character \"the chain-smoking mistress from hell\", but said the tennis net analogy has an \"unexpectedly crisp payoff\" and that the last act was well handled. Reviewing for the BBC's website, Andy Jacobs awarded the film four stars out of five, and called it Allen's best film since Deconstructing Harry (1997). He also criticized some other British reviewers whose dislike, Jacobs stated, was due to the fact that Allen presented an agreeable portrait of middle class life in London. He also praised the performances by Rhys Meyers and Johansson.Like many of Allen's films, Match Point was popular in France: AlloCin\u00e9, a cinema information website, gave it a score of 4.4 out of 5, based on a sample of 30 reviews. In Les Inrockuptibles, a left-wing French cultural magazine, Jean-Baptiste Morain gave the film a strong review, calling it \"one of his most accomplished films\". He characterized Allen's move to London as re-invigorating for him, while recognizing the caricatured portrayal of Britain which made the film less appreciated there than in Allen's homeland, the United States. Morain called Rhys-Meyers' and Johansson's performances \"impeccable\".Match Point has also been the object of scholarship. Joseph Henry Vogel argued the film is exemplary of ecocriticism as an economic school of thought. Several critics and commentators have compared elements of the film to the central plot of George Stevens' film A Place in the Sun (1951), but with some characters in reverse positions.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Charles \"Chuck\" Griffin, founder of the East Harlem Federation Youth Association (EHFYA), and his wife Anna Quick Griffin, set up the ensemble, initially to perform in colleges and at local benefits.  Their first major performance was at a benefit for Mayor John Lindsay, after which they attracted music director Bernice Cole (5 November 1921\u201319 November 2006), who had been a member of the Angelic Gospel Singers, to which she later returned.  They also gained a manager, Jerry Brandt, who had previously worked with Sam Cooke and who persuaded the ensemble to update their material and style.In January 1970, they performed at the \"Winter Festival for Peace\" at Madison Square Garden on a bill with Harry Belafonte, Richie Havens, Judy Collins, Dave Brubeck, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Rascals, Jimi Hendrix (who abandoned his performance after two numbers), and the cast of Hair.  They made regular TV appearances, and recorded an album for Elektra Records, Right On Be Free, released in 1970.  The album focused on ensemble singing in a traditional black gospel style, but with secular lyrics emphasising \"the power of the people\", and a \"soulful feel\".  Several of the tracks, including the title track \"Right On, Be Free\", were written by Chuck Griffin.  Lead vocals on Right On Be Free were by Cole, Anna Griffin, Gerri Griffin, and Cynthia Sessions.  The backing musicians included Richard Tee, Cornell Dupree, Chuck Rainey, and Ralph MacDonald, and the album was produced by David Rubinson.  The group received a standing ovation at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival in the UK, appeared at the Apollo Theater, and performed in Ghana in February 1971 at the Soul To Soul concert. Reviewing the LP in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \"Producer-manager Jerry Brandt has done a pretty good job of recording this untransportable troupe of twenty or so black adolescents.

Only days prior to being released digitally, the singer was announced as the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live, taking over for Janet Jackson who caught the flu and was unable to perform. Hosted by Jonah Hill, Carey performed both \"Touch My Body\", as well as live rendition of \"Migrate\" alongside T-Pain. Following the set, Carey and her manager at the time, Benny Medina, met with Lee Daniels, who then offered her a role in his film adaptation of Precious (2008), in which Carey would later star and earn acclaim for her acting. After reaching the top of the Billboard charts, the Empire State Building was lit up in Carey's motif colors, white, pink and lavender, for the entire week. On March 25, 2008, Carey was featured as the special guest performer at The Hills season premiere party, an event marking the start of a span of ten episodes airing in between season three and four. Carey performed \"Touch My Body\", \"I'm That Chick\" and \"We Belong Together\", before exiting the stage to a standing ovation. After the performance, Carey received strong praise from the program's cast members, with Lauren Conrad saying \"I've always been a huge Mariah fan, and she's just so beautiful and talented'. Whitney Port and Audrina Patridge referred to Carey as \"an amazing singer\", while claiming to have listened to her music from a young age. On April 12, 2008, Carey made an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Winfrey interviewed the singer on her weight loss, E=MC\u00b2, and even showed footage of Carey in her New York apartment, showing off her lingerie closet. Following the interview, Carey performed a live rendition of \"Bye Bye\" for the audience, with three background vocalists assisting her. Kevin Johnson from St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the performance as \"touching\", and complimented the song's appeal.\nOn the seventh season of the talent competition American Idol, Carey was featured as a mentor for the top-seven week. Titled \"Mariah Carey Week\" and airing live on April 14, 2008, the contestants were to perform a song from the singer's catalog. After all seven contestants sang their individual songs, they all came together for a live rendition of Carey's 1996 collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\". Overall, critics noted how a Carey themed week would be extremely difficult for the performers, due to their vocally strenuous nature. Following their joint performance, Carey emerged onto the stage and performed \"Bye Bye\" live, while backed by a trio of supporting vocalists. Tamara Jones of The Washington Post jokingly commented on Carey's flailing hand movements during the performance, writing how she was \"waving like a malevolent homecoming queen\". Gil Kaufman from MTV News complimented Carey's performance, commenting on her \"barely there micro-dress\" and writing how she \"serenaded the audience with her homage to lost ones.\" The Calgary Sun's Lindsey Ward described it as a \"less-than-fab performance\", although complimenting on Carey's leaner figure, \"Oh, who am I kidding? She would look hot in a paper bag.\" On April 25, 2008, Carey opened the Good Morning America \"Summer Concert Series\" with a live performance in Times Square. Carey, wearing a pink mini-skirt, began the set with \"Touch My Body\" in front of thousands of fans. During the song, her backing vocals began to malfunction, causing it to repeat phrases and play during her main vocal moments. In order to let the sound engineer know of the problem, she substituted part of the lyrics for \"stop singing my part now baby\", and completed the final chorus. She continued on with \"I'm That Chick\", and completed the three-song set-list with her follow-up single, \"Bye Bye\". After marking the album's stateside launch with her appearance on Good Morning America, Carey took to Europe to perform on several programs. She began with an interview on the British radio station, BBC Radio 1, and continued onto a live rendition of \"Touch My Body\" on both The Sunday Night Project and The Paul O'Grady Show.Similarly, Carey performed the song live on the German talent show, Deutschland sucht den Superstar (Germany searches for the superstar), in April 2008. On August 8, 2008, Carey performed a mash-up of the song at the 2008 Teen Choice Awards. She began with her single at the time, \"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\", and worked into the bridge of \"Touch My Body\", before reverting to the former song. At the Fashion Rocks ceremony in 2009, Carey performed \"Touch My Body\" and her current single, \"Obsessed\", as well as the remix to her 1995 song \"Fantasy\". During the set-list, Carey was accompanied by six men in black ties, who hoisted her into the air in front of over 6,000 people during \"Obsessed\", and rigorous dance routines throughout \"Touch My Body\". In promotion for E=MC\u00b2 and the single, Carey was featured as a guest judge and musical act on the fifth season of the British talent competition, The X Factor. During that week, all the contestants would have to sing songs from Carey's catalog. Prior to her arrival, one of the show's judges Dannii Minogue said \"Could it get any more nerve-wracking for the contestants?\", due to the general strenuous nature of Carey's songs. After several performances by the finalists, Carey performed \"I Stay in Love\", accompanied by three background vocalists. She received a standing ovation from the audience and judges, and continued backstage for a taped session with the contestants. At the end of the program, she performed her classic \"Hero\" (1993), and was eventually joined by the finalists for the finale of the song. \"Hero\" was re-recorded by the 2008 UK X Factor finalists and released as a single, becoming the best-selling single of 2008. According to reports, the episode gained a large increase in viewers due to Carey's presence, and was able to surpass its long-time rival program, Strictly Come Dancing, in the ratings. Carey made an appearance at the American Music Awards, held on November 23, 2008, at the Nokia Theatre. Wearing a long black gown, she performed the song after receiving an honorary award for her achievements in music.

He said of the EP that \"the writing is tighter, the production cleaner, and the performances more considered\" than on Rock n Roll and cited the \"pointless\" cover of \"Wonderwall\" as his \"only real disappointment\". Reviewing Love Is Hell pt. 2 for the same publication, Will Hermes gave it a B and wrote that \"song for song, the EPs trump Rock n Roll\", but felt that Adams gave off an image of \"a scattershot chameleon instead of [...] an artist who digs deep\".\nIn separate reviews of Love Is Hell pt. 1 and Pt. 2, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave both EPs 3.5 stars out of 5, while his review of the full album shows a rating of 4 stars out of 5. Referring to Adams as \"a synthesist more than a stylist\", he compared various songs from the album to multiple rock singer-songwriters and bands such as Jeff Buckley, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and The Smiths, noting that Love Is Hell coproducer John Porter had worked with the latter. However, while he deemed them both as \"tribute albums\", Erlewine called Love Is Hell \"more carefully considered in its production and writing\" than Rock n Roll. In a joint review of Rock n Roll and both Love Is Hell EPs, Matt Dentler of The Austin Chronicle rated Pt. 1 3.5 stars and Pt. 2 3 stars out of 5. He wrote  that Love Is Hell is \"far more dense and dark\" and \"spotty\" than Rock n Roll, but called the songs \"a fun challenge to crack open\" and highlighted \"Political Scientist\" for its \"delicate melodies\" as well as Adams's cover of \"Wonderwall\", which Dentler called \"surprisingly smart\".In a negative review, Hartley Goldstein wrote for Pitchfork that \"Adams is, at heart, an extremely gifted songwriter\" but panned his prolificness, feeling that Love Is Hell is \"a collection of preposterously cheerless (and charmless) songs that try much too hard to achieve a poignancy \u2014 or anything, really \u2014 that might hide their complete insignificance\". However, he cited the songs \"English Girls Approximately\" and \"Hotel Chelsea Nights\" as highlights, describing them as \"happy accidents\" and \"moments of clarity\" on the record. Similarly, the Uncut review of the Pt. 1 EP called it \"an utterly gloomungous affair with barely a crack of light piercing the lowering clouds of misery\", although it praised the bonus track \"Halloween\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "175_623", "question": "Who performed Mature Themes?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_39353", "text": "A major theme of the film is maturity. After leaving her parents who are supportive of her independence, Kiki has to face problems common to adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself. Dani Cavallaro notes that Kiki's Delivery Service also explores politeness, stating that the theme stems from a need to interact with others well in an unfamiliar setting. The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling notes a scene during Kiki's first night away from home where Kiki rushes back to her room and slams the door behind her to avoid being spotted by Fukuo. Fukuo, however, steps outside simply to stretch his arms, and Kiki's bizarrely shy behavior \"expresses [her] youth, vulnerability, and isolation.\"Another theme is the transition from traditional to contemporary. Kiki is shown to balance both of these qualities. For instance, Kiki observes the tradition of witches wearing black, but adorns her hair with a bright red bow. Kiki also engages in other traditional methods, such as baking with a wood-burning stove and flying her mother's old broom.Kiki's loss of her witch powers is considered the worst crisis she has to face during the film. Her loss of flight reflects the harm dealt to Kiki by her own self-doubts. This hardship causes Kiki to realize that being vulnerable does not always lead to failure and can help her learn valuable lessons to better understand herself. Petrana Radulovic also suggests that Jiji's bond with Kiki represents the experiences she had as a child, and that once Kiki loses her powers to talk to Jiji, she becomes more lonely. Jiji had served as the wiser voice (imaginary companion) to Kiki, and she stopped being able to understand him the moment she struggles with self-doubt. According to Miyazaki himself, Jiji is meant to represent the immature side of Kiki, and her inability to talk to Jiji represents her newfound maturity at the end of the movie.In relation to Kiki's portrayal as a witch, some have drawn comparisons to historical or contemporary views on witches and witchcraft. The film incorporates some conventions from fairy-tales such as a black cat companion for Kiki, Kiki's use of a broom for flight, and her black dress. While girls with magical powers are common in Japanese television, Miyazaki wanted to stray away from the various stereotypes generated from these shows, remarking that witchcraft \"has always merely been the means to fulfill the dreams of young girls.\" This stereotypical portrayal of witches is also shown in the older witch Kiki encounters while travelling to Koriko.Kiki has also been compared to other characters in Miyazaki's films. While there are overt differences in demeanor between Kiki and San from Princess Mononoke, a character who is motivated by anger, both characters take control over their own lives. This theme of remarkable independence is also seen in Miyazaki's earlier works, such as in Nausica\u00e4 in Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind. Kiki is also compared to Chihiro of Spirited Away as they are both young girls attempting to seek independence without being rebellious. Both Chihiro and Kiki develop their independence with the help of their friends.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Yevgeny Dolmatovsky recalled in the book \"Stories about your songs\" (1973):\n\"Tenderness\" is like a spell of a woman, a friend of the pilot, who released her beloved to the stars and is waiting for his return. The source of the song is the hour and a half that it took Yuri Gagarin to fly around the globe, the hours and minutes that other cosmonauts and <test-pilot> Georgy Mosolov spent on daring flights. It is not by chance that the poets Grebennikov and Dobronravov remembered Exup\u00e9ry. One of the first to talk ably about the experiences and feelings of a man who has gained wings, this dreamer and warrior, and cosmonauts, including Yuri Gagarin, often told poets: write about Exup\u00e9ry!In order for a song to be born and turned out, many circumstances, impressions, finds are needed.

In the summer of that year, Ahn came back to Korea on a music performance trip to gather funds for the reconstruction of a burned down church. There he happened to meet Yi Sangjae, the founder of the Dokrip Newspaper, and Jo Mansik, an independence movement leader who advocated the use of Korean-made products so that Koreans' debts might be paid. Upon Jo's request, Ahn led a demonstration promoting the use of Korean commodities by playing his cello in an automobile.\nIn 1928, Ahn's father died, and his mother faced financial difficulty in providing for all five of her sons' education. Therefore, Ahn was hired by a luxurious restaurant as a cellist. Even then, Ahn could not fully pay for his tuition, and the school therefore forbade Ahn to graduate. Furthermore, Ahn accidentally broke his cello, and had to borrow his classmate's. One of Ahn's Japanese peers expressed his respect for Ahn by purchasing him a new Suzuki violin. Eventually, Ahn was able to graduate when his teacher Hansford paid all of Ahn's tuition fees. Ahn had a late graduation, which, although for only one person, proceeded as if it were for many. Following his teacher's proposals, Ahn performed a cello concert; at this performance, a Japanese newspaper appraised Ahn as \"a genius with a bright future\".In May 1930, Ahn returned to Korea. Upon his visit to the Soongsil Middle School, Dr. Mauri suggested to Ahn that he continue his studies in the United States.

It was inspired in the economic crisis that Argentina was facing back in 2001 and also in the feelings of distress generated by the massive exile of many young Argentines, that decided to flee from their country, in a desperate move to find a future. \u00a8Emigrante\u00a8 was nominated for the Latin Grammy Awards of 2004 in the category of \"Best Instrumental\", and later reached platinum status in Argentina in 2006 and double platinum in 2009. According to The Los Angeles Times, Tanghetto is the most seductive electrotango band that is based in Buenos Aires and the album \"Emigrante\" is \"marked by its languid melodies, its smoky textures and the kind of delicate piano lines that would make Massive Attack proud\". They presented the album in many different venues in Buenos Aires and as a part of the Festival y Mundial de Tango, and also at the most iconic place in Buenos Aires, their show at the Obelisco. In December 2004 the group released an album from a side project called Hybrid Tango, in which a variety of world music styles are blended with their unique sound, including flamenco, candombe, and jazz. This album was also nominated for the Latin Grammy Awards of 2005 in the Traditional/ Best Tango Category.\nIn October 2005 a new album, Buenos Aires Remixed, was released. It's an album that contains 12 remixed versions of Tanghetto songs plus two cover songs (Enjoy the Silence, from Depeche Mode and New Order's Blue Monday). Their version of \"Blue Monday\" became an alternative radio hit in the US, and a favorite on KCRW radio station in Los Angeles. Buenos Aires Remixed reached gold status in early 2007 and became their second platinum album later that year. In 2005 they released their first controversial video \"Tangocrisis\", with images of the Argentine economic crisis. Their second video from \u00a8Hybrid Tango\u00a8, \"Barrio Sur\" was their first video with rotation on MTV. In July 2006 they released their first DVD, \"Live in Buenos Aires\".\nAfter consistently touring through Europe and the Americas, the band recorded their next studio album, called El Miedo a la Libertad, named after Erich Fromm's classic essay, Fear of Freedom. The album was released on March 1, 2008, and in July 2009 it won a Gardel Award, the Argentine equivalent of the Grammy.\nIn late 2009 after their first big tour in Brazil, they released a new studio album called M\u00e1s All\u00e1 del Sur which was also nominated for a Carlos Gardel Award, this time in 2010. In 2011 they released their album VIVO (live around the world) which was recorded during their last two tours. The album also includes a cover version of \"Seven Nation Army\" from The White Stripes and an electrotango version of the song \"Computer Love\" by German electro pioneers Kraftwerk. There's a second volume for the \"VIVO\" album dubbed \"VIVO 'Milonguero'\" with 14 live tracks, including unplugged versions recorded during the 2007 BBC Sessions and some bonus tracks, such as Piazzolla's \"Allegro Tangabile\". This album features a notable live version of \"Libertango\" also by the great tango creator Astor Piazzolla. \u00a8VIVO Milonguero\u00a8 won their second Gardel Award. In late 2012 a concept album called Incidental Tango was released, with the participation of guest arranger / pianist Aldo Di Paolo. For the \u00a8Incidental Tango\u00a8 album, Masri envisioned the notion that music is always the soundtrack of everyone's life, and thus Tango in all of its forms is the 'incidental music' of life in Buenos Aires. Tanghetto toured all over Europe in 2013, playing in one of the most important venues in London, The O2 Arena, and toured Romania and Poland for the first time. They also toured in Latin America, in Mexico, Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Argentina. In 2014 they released the follow-up to their 2004 concept album \u00a8Hybrid Tango\u00a8, named \u00a8Hybrid Tango II\u00a8. The album consisted of new recorded material and some songs that were not used in other albums but were of excellent artistic quality and were kept for this project. In September 2014 Tanghetto was nominated for the third time to the Latin Grammy's with \u00a8Hybrid Tango II\u00a8 competing with Ruben Blades who won. In 2015 they released the album \"Progressive Tango\" and got their 6th nomination to the Gardel Awards. \u00a8Progressive Tango\u00a8, first promo single became the number one song played from Tanghetto in Spotify. With that tour they played in Europe, America and Asia. In 2016 they released the album \"Desenchufado\", it was also nominated to the Gardel Awards becoming their 7th nomination to the most prestigious awards in Argentina in 2017. In 2018 they released the album \"Vivo en Buenos Aires\" recorded at some of the most important music halls of Buenos Aires and it features two new songs. In July 2018 they played for the first time at the iconic Lincoln Center in New York City for 3,000 people. In 2019 they performed their most important show in Buenos Aires celebrating 15 years of the \"Emigrante\" Album, playing at the Ballena Azul Symphony Hall, with three Argentine music legends as special guests: Pedro Aznar, Sandra Mihanovich and Nito Mestre. \nIn early 2020 they played in Buenos Aires's iconic tango venues the Torcuato Tasso, La Viruta and Salon Canning, and after that (because of the Pandemic) they only did virtual or \"from home\" concerts and some TV specials. Also in 2020 they released their 8th studio album \"Reinventango\" that was nominated to the Gardel Awards 2021 in the category \"Best Tango Orchestra\", an historic achievement for an electroango band. In May 2021 they released the album \"Tanghetto plays Piazzolla\" as a tribute to the legendary Argentine musician Astor Piazzolla and it gets nominated to the Latin Grammys of the same year. According to Grammy.com (the official site of The Grammys) Tanghetto's Reinventango presents a rugged masterpiece of melancholy melodies and sharp beats.

{"id": "175_642", "question": "Who performed Naturally?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_7328", "text": "The documentary opens with an introduction by Tilda Swinton, who gives a backstory about Bj\u00f6rk's career and her intention with the Biophilia project, stating that the singer conceived the project wanting to redefine music in the 21st Century. Images from the \"Moon and \"Mutual Core\" music videos accompany her speech. After that, some frames focus on the Graduale Nobili who are singing the backing vocals to \"Thunderbolt\" on a cliff in front of the ocean in Iceland. Thereafter the scene shifts to an early rehearsal of the Biophilia songs in Iceland during November 2010. The choir begin to learn their parts in \"Thunderbolt\" and \"Moon\" under the guide of the singer. After that, the documentary shows the encounter between Bj\u00f6rk and Sir David Attenborough in the Natural History Museum in London. There, the naturalist and the singer discuss about the nature of music. They first talk about the importance of music and singing in the nature, with Attenborough explaining how music works for birds like the bird-of-paradise and the lyrebird, whose chirping is defined by the naturalist the \"most complex sound ever\", and he goes on by stating that the bird has developed an \"impressive vocal range\" which he compares to that of Bj\u00f6rk. Attenborough states that the human larynx is capable of many more sounds that preceded language. Therefore, the singer asks him how he thinks music works for the modern people, and the naturalist explains how he thinks popular music is \"extremely sexual\", comparing popular music to medieval troubadors, and that is why is so relatable to young people and animals, i.e. the gibbons, which mate by singing together out of excitement. Attenborough affirms that \"the mystery is how music has been used by humanity for something that is transcendental\".\nFootage from another rehearsal with the choir singing \"Dark Matter\" are shown before shifting to the encounter between Bj\u00f6rk and Henry Dagg in a metal workshop. Dagg had created the Sharpsichord, a solar powered cross between a harp and a barrel organ, which Bj\u00f6rk wanted to incorporate in one song. They are shown rehearsing \"Sacrifice\" and discussing the composition of the song. Attenborough states that our emotion comes from nature and that a composer has to be in contact with it. He then manages to compare the sound of Benjamin Britten's Sea interludes (which is playing in the background) to the sound of waves. The natural structure of music inspires Bj\u00f6rk who wants to bring nature in her composition. To discuss \"Crystalline\", Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough go to the crystal room of the museum. They talk about the mathematical basis of Bj\u00f6rk's songs, who explains the time signatures of the verses and the chorus of \"Crystalline\" and compares the composition of a crystal to that of a song. Scenes from the choir recording parts of \"Crystalline\" guided by Biophilia musical director Matt Robertson are shown. Attenborough thinks that the beauty of mathematics can be heard in composition like the \"Fugue 5\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. Swinton tells how universe is made of patterns which are present in music but that we can't visualise, and how Bj\u00f6rk wants to change that. Because of that, the singer collaborates with Evan Grant, who works with cymatics. Grant explains how the Chladni plate works, and that he appreciates how Bj\u00f6rk tries to bring a real meaning in her music by taking a \"scientific and realistic approach\" to it. Grant tries to use cymatics on water for \"Crystalline\", which results can be seen in the music video for the song (directed by Michel Gondry).\nSwinton explains how Bj\u00f6rk's aim is to bring nature on stage for the Biophilia performance. Footage from the final rehearsal at Campfield Market Hall in Manchester for Biophilia world premiere at the Manchester International Festival is shown, with the Sharpsichord arriving at the venue. Some of other instruments used during the show are presented, like MIDI-controlled Tesla coil, invented by Nikola Tesla, and a gravity-harnessed pendulum harp invented by Andy Cavatorta of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Cavatorta recounts how Bj\u00f6rk declared to him that she wanted nature to appear like \"some sort of a rock star on stage\", and tells that the first prototypes of the instruments were filmed and shown to Bj\u00f6rk before she approved the final result. In one of the prototypes video the inventor puts a figurine of Bj\u00f6rk (as pictured in the Volta album cover) between the swings. The instrument, created solely for the \"Solstice\" performance, was commissioned because, as Bj\u00f6rk declares, the singer \"got obsessed\" with basslines (she hums a bassline of a composition by John Tavener as she says so).\n\nOne of the major inspiration of the project itself, neurologist Oliver Sacks, who Bj\u00f6rk define as the \"David Attenborough of the brain\", lists the benefits music has on human and explains how when a human listens to music every part of the brain gets involved. This is very useful to people who suffers from dementia, who need evocative music which can help them in building a bridge to their past. Scenes from a nursing home, in which various patients with dementia are shown to benefit from different music played to them, accompany Sacks' speech. He affirms that the music expresses something that language can't.\nScenes from the first performance of Biophilia are shown. David Attenborough's intro, which accompany the show, is partially heard, while Bj\u00f6rk affirms that music is a catalyst between the outer world and the inner world. A performance of \"Thunderbolt\" is partially shown, during which the singer is seen wearing a dress by Michael van der Ham, along with a big red wig, while the Tesla coil plays on stage. Swinton states that Biophilia \"nature, music and technology come together\" and that the Icelandic singer wants to develop a new kind of music-making which is \"intuitive and accessible for everyone\". This is driven by her desire to change we think of music, because, as the singer herself explains, by recounting her musical education, the \"academic approach to music is a barrier to people actually making music\". Oliver Sacks agrees with her by stating that the sheet music and the keys of a piano are \"intimidating and much more complicated than language\". Because of that, the singer tries to use technology to make it more intuitive. As a consequence of this, Bj\u00f6rk works with Damian Taylor. Taylor tries to use a ball and a cardboard box, along with a gamepad, instead of a keyboard. Bj\u00f6rk's solution came with the diffusion of tablet computer, which touch screen the singer compares to a tambourine for its being spontaneous and instinctive. By developing this idea, she decides to make a different format of album, made with apps. She works with interactive media artist Scott Snibbe, who states that her aim is the turn music \"into something full sensory\".\nBj\u00f6rk explains some of the apps that are part of the album, like \"Moon\", which app deals with sequences, \"Mutual Core\", in which chords are represented with strata, and \"Thunderbolt\", which use lightnings as visual representation of arpeggios. Bj\u00f6rk states that a famous example of arpeggio is \"I Feel Love\" by Donna Summer. Snibbe then affirms that, \"if we change the visual representation, the way in which people think about music is changed\". To engage people with her new conception of music, Bj\u00f6rk rolls out a programme of music workshops for children in school around the world (footage from a workshop in Buenos Aires is shown) which, as Swinton informs, is now a standard part of the music curriculum in Iceland. Bj\u00f6rk confesses that she always dreamt about running a music school and that she considers this project her music school. After one year from the first show in Manchester, the Biophilia Tour reaches the World Sacred Music Festival in Fes, Morocco, during which Bj\u00f6rk is seen performing \"Cosmogony\". Sacks finally states that \"music unify people at an elementary level\". The documentary ends with a final conversation between Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough, in which the naturalist affirms:\n\n\"Music, to be most rewarding, [...] does require work, and does require concentration, does require thought, which is why your music is so challenging, because it does require thought. So much of what you do, is completely new, [and] hasn't been done by people before, and that's what's challenging about that. So, if you're very tired, I don't suggest that they put on your music. I put on your music when I really want to think about something.\"\nTo which Bj\u00f6rk blushes, and then the pair laugh together. The end credits roll to \"Cosmogony\" in the background.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The song is guided by the shifting guitar of Robert Fripp, but it is in the tense violin of David Cross and the chaotic percussion of Jamie Muir that Part I is defined.  The track goes through numerous varied acts and passages, with somber moments and a calm violin solo falling alongside periods of heightened aggression where Fripp's guitar borders on heavy metal and Muir's clangs reach cacophony. Bird calls, metallic clangs, horns, breaking crockery and tin ripping are all featured in Muir's repertoire, and, along with his percussive contributions, he coined the title \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\". In a 1991 interview, Muir said it was a \"very admirable creative decision\" for Fripp to work with him. Much of the track originated from full-band improvisations that began in 1971, with Cross calling it \"grown\" instead of written. Drummer Bill Bruford said the songs were \"hell\" to make given the deliberate lack of in-studio structure. An early version of Part I recorded by the 1971 lineup appeared as a bonus track on the 40th-anniversary edition of Islands under the name \"A Peacemaking Stint Unrolls\".\n\nWhile the first part is a many-sectioned, dynamic song that has been described as having a \"kitchen-sink sensibility\", \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\" is much more straightforward and riff-focused, with the sole writing credit going to Fripp. PopMatters called the track a \"roller-coaster of wrath and control\". The main riff of part II, which emerged in 1972 during a live performance at Richmond, Kentucky, is heavy and driving, drawing its host album to a dramatic climax. While the guitar in part II may be the most immediately obvious aspect, John Goldsby of Bass Player called the bass in the song something that \"bass players will still be talking about four decades later\". Fripp considered the first two parts of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" as the refinement of his role as composer in King Crimson.According to Fripp, Part I was conceived as the beginning of a King Crimson performance, and Part II as the end. \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\" was performed from 1972 to 1974, predominantly in a shortened seven-minute version that left out most of the violin solo and protracted ending passage. Part I was not performed again until 2014, when it was reintroduced as a setlist staple; it remained there through 2019. The new arrangement featured all of the violin segments played on guitar save for the solo, which was performed by Mel Collins on flute. Part II, alternatively, persisted in King Crimson's sets throughout most of their career.Both the first and second parts of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" have been met with critical acclaim. In 2011, Sean Murphy of PopMatters ranked the \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\" as the eighth best progressive rock song ever. He revised his placement in 2017, putting part I as number fifteen and \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\" as eighty-five.

Half of it is about my ex-fianc\u00e9 who meant everything to me, so once Motograter had fell apart and then her and I dwindled apart it just took a huge part of my life.

Vogel bases the presence of puppets on what she claims is \"one Westerner's misunderstanding of bunraku,\" the centuries-old form of Japanese puppetry. (Vogel does, however, write that other styles of puppets would be acceptable, so long as the children-puppets do not become \"cute or coy.\") Vogel indicates the play's flexibility in regard to the use and number of puppeteers. Some productions, including the world premiere, utilize three-person bunraku teams to manipulate the puppets: an omozukai controls the right hand of the puppet, a hidarizukai controls the left hand of the puppet, and an ashizukai controls the feet. Other productions, sometimes responding to the economic considerations of hiring additional performers, have used a single puppeteer for each child puppet (though this makes it impossible to use traditional bunraku puppets). Regardless of the type of puppeteering arrangement employed, the chief (or in some cases, sole) puppeteer will later assume the role of the child as an adult.\nBoth the 2003 world premiere at the Trinity Repertory Company and subsequent 2004 production at the Long Wharf Theatre featured bunraku puppets created by Basil Twist, a New York-based puppeteer.\nThe traditional bunraku function of the Japanese tay\u016b (or chanter), who, among other narrative tasks, performs a puppet character's utterances, is fulfilled by the Man or Woman narrator at the beginning of the journey and then by a puppeteer (one per child character) in the latter part of the journey. In so doing, Vogel is able to continue the traditional tay\u016b's fluctuation between first-person and second-person address.\nThe Man and Woman, who begin the play as omniscient narrators, soon assume the roles of the mother and father during the journey. These two performers initially speak all stage dialogue, including the lines of the children and some stage directions. Gradually, the three actors who begin the play as the chief puppeteers of the three children begin to speak the children's lines, relegating the Man and Woman to roles as the parents and occasional narrators. The human actors speaking the children's lines during the opening automobile journey abandon the puppets in the latter portion of the play to fully embody the adult characters during lengthy monologues.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She performed three songs for executives of Sony Music Colombia, who were impressed enough to sign her, at the age of 13, to record three albums, which were Magia, Peligro and Pies Descalzos.The low-budget Magia was put in almost three months of pre-production, which involved choreography of live performances for the album, singing lessons for Shakira, and arranging the songs. The concept of the music still reflected her personality, despite the fact that it was managed by the record label. The tracks deal with emotions of a person's first time falling in love, and range from a love poem (\"Sue\u00f1os\") to a celebration of dance (\"Esta noche voy contigo\"). These were influenced from experiences with males such as her ex-boyfriend Oscar Pardo, stories told by her father, and dreams of living on the coast. In the book Shakira: Woman Full of Grace, Ximena Diego wrote that the album \"demonstrated her [Shakira's] indisputable potential.\"Magia is a collection of songs written by Shakira between the ages of 8 and 12, and mainly consists of pop ballads.

At the beginning of the performance, the coaches have their backs turned to the participants, and if one of the coaches wants to take on a participant, they press their buttons and turn around to the singer who is automatically placed on his team. If more than one coach is turned around, the singer chooses the coach they want to work with. In the first four seasons and from the tenth, blind auditions end with the selection of 12 contestants. The size of the teams, however, varied over the seasons (13 in seasons 5 and 9; 14 in seasons 6 to 8; and 15 in season 14).\nFrom the eleventh season during blind auditions, each coach can \"block\" another. The coach against whom the block was used loses the chance to invite that participant to their team. Each coach can use this feature only twice. If a coach uses a \"block\" against another coach and  they do not turn around - the \"block\" is considered unused; this means that the block can be used as long as the coach who uses it actually \"blocks\" someone. \"Block\" buttons can be used both during and after a contestant's performance. In the fourteenth season, coaches will be able to use their block button only after a contestant's performance, unlike in the previous seasons.\nThe Battles round\nThis is followed by battles in which the coaches choose two people from their team (when the number of participants in a team is uneven, one of the battles is played by a trio, not a duo) who sing the same song together. The coach decides who moves on to the next stage and who drops out of the program. In the first season, coaches were assisted by invited specialists who were supposed to help them make the decision. From the second season onwards, the other coaches can make a \"steal\", i.e. take the loser to their team (by pressing their button). If more than one coach wants to steal a participant, that participant has the right to choose which team they want to go to. \nIn the seventh season, the \"stealing\" system has changed to what is known as the \"hot chairs\". Each coach can ultimately steal only one contestant (who sits on the hot seat assigned to that coach's team), because when \"stealing\" another contestant, the previously stolen person is replaced and dropped out of the competition; from the seventh to ninth seasons, each coach could steal (press the button and take over a contestant) up to three times, but from the tenth season, coaches can press the button to steal a contestant without any limitations. The battles therefore end with seven participants advancing to the next stage. During the ninth season, there was the first ever elimination of all participants from a team in one battle. \nIn season 14, battles have been divided into 2 parts: pre-battle and the main battle. During the pre-battle, the coaches pick three of their artists in a singing match and then select two of them to advance to the main battle to perform as a duo. During the main battle, the winning artists will battle once again, performing a different song. The coach select one of them to advance to the next round, while the other will be eliminated. At the end of this round, five artists will remain on each team. For the first time since the inaugural season, there are no steals during the battles round. \nThe Knockouts round\nThe battles are followed by the knockout round (in the first edition: overtime), in which the coaches eliminate more people who do not advance to the live episodes. During first six seasons, each of the coaches selected three people from his or her team (six people in the first season, seven people in the second season, eight people in seasons three to five, and nine people in the sixth season) who automatically qualified for the live shows. The coaches divided the others into threes (into two duos by the second season), and one person from each would move on to the next stage. Since the seventh season, all contestants have to sing - the first four from each team are automatically put in the hot seats, and after subsequent performances of the remaining three, the coach decides whether a given contestant stays in the show or not. Four (five in the first, second and sixth seasons) finalists from each team qualify for the live episodes. In the fourteenth season, five contestants will compete for the place in the live shows, but only four of them will advance to the next stage.\nThe Live Shows\nWhen the teams consist of five, four, or three contestants, the coach chooses from among the two contestants with the fewest votes from the viewers (who decide by sending text messages) the person who drops out of the show. Each live episode ends with the elimination of one person from each group. In eleventh season due to the coronavirus pandemic episodes were previously recorded and the elimination rules were changed. Once all participants from a given team sang their songs, the coaches scored the performances, awarding them from one to ten points. The coach of that team would then select one participant to move on to the next stage (regardless of the score). The participant with the lowest number of points was eliminated from the remaining three or two (in case of a tie, the points from the coach of the evaluated team were decisive).\nIn the semi-finals (when the team is made up of two people), the coach divides 100 points between the contestants and then everyone is credited with as many points as the percentage of votes they get from the viewers. In the fifth season, while the semi-final took the form of what is known in the international format as \"Cross Battles\", which involved contestants dueling between teams. In the semi-final of the eleventh season the deciding factor was the total number of points awarded by all the coaches.\nThe Final\nFour participants (one from each team, with the exception of the fifth season), and the winner is chosen by viewers in an SMS vote. Voting is divided into three rounds; after each round, the person with the fewest number of votes drops out. In the first round the finalists sing a foreign language song followed by a duet with their coach; in the second round the repertoire consists of Polish songs; in the third round the remaining two contestants sing their own songs. In the fourteenth season all contestants who will advance to the live shows will sing along with the finalists.", "hasanswer": false}]}

There is no doubt that Euripides transformed Caranus to Archelaus (meaning \"leader of the people\") in the play, in an attempt to please Archelaus I of Macedon.  In the play, Archelaus son of Temenus was exiled from Argos by his brothers and went to Thrace, to king Cisseus who happened to be at war with neighbouring people and promised Archelaus his kingdom and daughter if he could protect him against the enemies. Archelaus did it and went to ask the king for his promised reward. The king however broke his promise and decided to kill Archelaus by treachery. He therefore gave orders to prepare a pitfall to trap him. But a slave of the king told Archelaus about the plot and the hero asked for a secret interview with the king: when alone he threw him inside the pitfall.

However, Fait ignores this warning, and the criminals attempt a daring escape past a SWAT team blockade.

She next appeared in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance (1840) and a year later, toured with Perrot to other parts of Europe. Through Perrot's contacts, the pair worked in Paris, London, Vienna, Munich, and Milan where she sang and danced. Of her two talents, it was her dancing that was acclaimed. By dancing Perrot's choreography, which at that time was receiving great attention, she gained notable attention of both the public and the critics.\nHer greatest role however was that of Giselle. The world premi\u00e8re of this two-act ballet was on 28 June 1841 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique, Paris. The part of \"Albrecht\" was danced by Lucien Petipa (the brother of the great Marius Petipa), with the part of Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis danced by Ad\u00e8le Dumil\u00e2tre. It caused a sensation and inspired its reviewers to proclaim Giselle to be the greatest ballet of its time and a triumphant successor to the Romantic masterwork La Sylphide. It immediately established Grisi as a star in her very first full-length ballet in Paris. Her salary grew from 5,000 francs to 12,000 in 1842 and 20,000 by 1844, with additional performance fees on top. It also marked the beginning of a change in her relationship with Jules Perrot.\nDance historian Lillian Moore says of her \"In Grisi were united all the best attributes of the other outstanding ballerinas of the romantic period: the buoyant elevation of Taglioni, the technical virtuosity and mimic powers of Elssler, and the joyous, exuberant facility of Cerrito. If she could not claim to surpass her peers in any one aspect of her art, Grisi outstripped them all in versatility.\"\nGrisi's last performance in the west was in Paul Taglioni's Les M\u00e9tamorphoses (aka Satanella, 1849).\nIn 1850, she joined Perrot in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he had been appointed ballet master, and she danced Giselle at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre. The first Giselle in Russia had been danced by Fanny Elssler, and so the initial reaction to Grisi's interpretation of the role was not enthusiastic. However, over time the Russians appreciated her talents. She was prima ballerina of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres in St. Petersburg from 1850 to 1853, working not only with Perrot but also Joseph Mazilier who staged for her La Jolie Fille de Gand and Vert-Vert especially for her.\n\nIn 1854, with her daughter, Julie-Marie, she left Russia for Warsaw, where she intended to continue dancing. But she became pregnant by Prince L\u00e9on Radziwill, who persuaded her to retire from ballet at the height of her fame. Grisi gave birth to her second daughter, L\u00e9ontine Grisi, in 1855 and at the age of 34 settled in Saint-Jean, Geneva to live at Villa Grisi (also called Villa Saint-Jean; no longer extant), for the next 46 years of her life in peaceful retirement. She died there on 20 May 1899, at age 79.\nOne of the creators of Giselle, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, who was married to Carlotta's sister Ernestina, described her dancing as having a childlike artlessness, a happy and infectious gaiety. Carlotta Grisi was the cousin of the famous soprano singers, the sisters Giuditta and Giulia Grisi.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The video was released on July 27, 2007.The video contains cuts of the band performing the song and a troubled couple portrayed by Harris and Moody.

They accidentally spill a beer and the couple then suddenly begin to fight, and bassist Matt Snell then pulls Moody away from his girlfriend. After the fight, it cuts to shots of Harris crying in the mirror and the couple having sex. It then shows Moody reading a letter and Harris taking a large amount of pills.

This magnificent, sad masterpiece about race, history, and defeated dreams can easily stand comparison with Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men.

In every way, Shadow Country is a bravura performance, at once history, fiction, and myth\u2014as well as the capstone to the career of one of the most admired and admirable writers of our time.\nTom LeClair, reviewing the work for the New York Times, considered that the work failed to live up to the sum total of its originally published parts, stating:\n\nBy reducing his Watson materials to one volume, Matthiessen has sacrificed qualities that gave those novels their powerful reinforcing illusions of authenticity and artlessness. Book I still has that Ten Thousand Islands quality, but \"Shadow Country\" as a whole is like the Tamiami Trail that crosses the Everglades. It offers a quicker and easier passage through the swamp, but fewer shades and shadows.\nTampa Bay Times book editor Colette Bancroft praised the book's wider theme and context:\n\nMatthiessen is writing about one man's life in Shadow Country, but he is also writing about the life of the nation over the course of half a century. Watson's story is essentially the story of the American frontier, of the conquering of wild lands and people, and of what such empires cost. Most of the book is set in frontier Florida, a Florida virtually unimaginable in our air-conditioned, subdivided century. It is a brutally beautiful wilderness where, just 100 years ago, panthers and red wolves stalked the woods, plume hunters made fortunes wiping out whole species of birds and men like Watson made their own law.\nShadow Country takes us there in unforgettable fashion.

Although following a renewed interest in funk gave them a number 3 UK hit with its first single, \"Chant No. 1 (I Don't Need This Pressure On)\", the writer's block Kemp suffered as it climbed the UK Singles Chart resulted in his mimicking its use of horns and group vocals for the next single, \"Paint Me Down\", which had a number 30 showing in the UK, the lowest peak position there of any of their singles to date. An experiment with the eastern European sound from American film scores for the third single, \"She Loved Like Diamond\", fared even worse just as Diamond was about to be released; that inspired the idea to take another song from the album, \"Instinction\", and hire a new producer to remix it in the hope that it would perform better. Kemp described that track as being the closest thing to a pop song that Spandau Ballet had yet recorded. The band hired Buggles founder Trevor Horn to do the new arrangement of the song, which reached number ten in the UK and made Kemp realise that the clubgoers they had initially catered to were no longer interested in their music. He was now able to write songs without concern for their danceability or adherence to current tastes. In his autobiography I Know This Much: From Soho to Spandau, he explained, \"The freedom of not having to write just for Soho meant I could dive into that great big reservoir of pop, deep with melody and soul, and hopefully surface with the pearls I wanted.\"Because of the rebound the band experienced with Horn's reworking of \"Instinction\", the plan was to have him produce the next album. He was especially impressed with one of Kemp's recent compositions, \"Pleasure\", and wanted to start working with the band on it immediately. The rehearsal went well, and they began recording it at AIR Studios with the mindset that it would be the first single from the new album, which was initially called The Pleasure Project. On the first day of recording, however, Horn had drummer John Keeble redo the track repeatedly over the course of the ten-hour day to try to get it perfect and called Kemp that evening to offer to programme the drums and suggest that they get a new drummer. Kemp was stunned by the suggestion: \"I heard myself saying that programming the drums would not just be psychologically wrong for our team spirit, but it would also undermine John as a player.\" He refused Horn, who decided not to continue working with them. Later in 1982 Kemp told Smash Hits magazine, \"We couldn't have worked with Trevor because he was too overpowering, too dogmatic.\"The band's manager, Steve Dagger, suggested producers Tony Swain and Steve Jolley, who recently had success with Bananarama, and Kemp performed some of the songs he had just written for the duo with the plan of having them produce the first single from the new album to see if they had a good working relationship with the band. While Swain was leaning toward \"Communication\" as the best choice for their next hit song, Jolley insisted that they work on the \"up-tempo, more obvious pop sing-along\" \"Lifeline\". The band was credited alongside Jolley and Swain as producers of \"Lifeline\" and would be on the album as well.\n\"Lifeline\" was recorded at Red Bus Studios in Paddington as Spandau Ballet got a feel for their new producers, but they worked on the rest of the album at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas because of the soul music that had been recorded there and because Kemp felt that the tropical surroundings would help give the music the feeling he was trying to achieve.

Entertainment Weekly's Whitney Pastorek gave it an A\u2212 rating, and complimented its minimal production. The Daily News reviewer called the single \"very wonderful\". British Music Week gave the single five out of five, remarking that it \"looks set to crash into the mainstream\".

The album opens with \"Perfection\", which was co-written and produced by Dan Carey. It features \"dreamy violin-laden confessions\" and was called a \"take on Misery-era Blonde Redhead\" by Drowned in Sound's John Calvert. \"Break the Chain\" references the singer's back injury following a dancing accident, where she refuses doctor's orders by continuing to pursue her dreams; it contains dubstep and flamenco \"undertones\" in addition to shackle sound effects. \"Sun of a Gun\" uses a metaphor regarding the orbit of the sun to describe being in love with someone who is \"destructive\" and \"dangerous\". The song's Europop sound was compared to the works of Kylie Minogue and Goldfrapp. The fourth track and third single, \"Voodoo\", is a synth-pop track that has Oh Land performing a \"spoken word verse over disco beats\". BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine wrote that the track's style was similar to the work of Marina and the Diamonds. He also compared the album's fifth track, \"Lean\", to Massive Attack's \"Teardrop\" (1998). \"Lean\" and \"Wolf & I\" are trip hop tracks, with the latter being described as dramatic by Gaffa's Michael Jose Gonzalez.\"Human\", the album's seventh track, is an emo-disco barnstormer\" that sounds Robyn-esque. Barry Walters from Spin stated that the song \"violates just as many grammar rules as the Killers\". \"White Nights\" is the fourth single and is lyrically about dreaming. As described by Leahey from AllMusic, the track blends Motown, synth-pop, and Tropic\u00e1lia into one song. \"Helicopter\" is the ninth track and is a collaboration between Oh Land and songwriter/producer Lester Mendez. It is reminiscent of Feist's work and features \"skittish electronics and dubby beats\". The following track is \"We Turn It Up\", which McAlpine considered \"perky enough to have served as a replacement for that Shakira World Cup song\". It was also described as a \"silly kiss-off party song\". The album closes with \"Rainbow\", which John Calvert felt was influenced by Oh Land's decision to move to Brooklyn.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It has been described as the blender between 1997's Hearts Once Nourished with Hope and Compassion and 2003's That Within Blood Ill-Tempered, by Shai Hulud's guitarist, Matt Fox:\n\nThe sound.. it's hard for me to answer it accurately, it would be better to ask somebody who is listening to it. If you ask me, when I listen to 'Hearts Once Nourished..' our first album, I think it's very rhythm based. It's very very melodic, but it's definitely more rhythm based. When you listen to 'That Within Blood Ill-Tempered', it's clearly more melody based... so a lot of my friends said: 'If you guys could combine the drive, the rock, and the aggression of \"Hearts\" and the structuring, the melody and the intelligence of \"That Within Blood Ill Tempered\", you might have my favorite album of all time.' So again, because I can never answer a question just directly, to answer your question directly, what we try to do is combine both albums. We wanted to make it smart, and heavy, we wanna make it sound great. We wanted to give something to people where they could groove along to it and rock for more than a second and a half without changing, but we also wanted to maintain some technical intelligent aspect, and the melodic nature of our last album. So if you take both those albums, throw them in a blender, I think you might have something that resembles 'Misanthrophy Pure'.\n\"It's faster, slower, more metal, less metal, more rock, more progressive, and less progressive than anything we've ever done. It's like that movie 'Deep Blue Sea'. The tagline on the DVD box is 'Bigger. Faster. Smarter. Meaner.' That's how this record is. Is it the best thing we've ever done? I don't know.

It just got to the point where we didn't enjoy what we were doing anymore. There was no love for the music and no love for being on stage with one another, so it just seemed like we were constantly battling one another for different things. We all took time off hoping that would help resolve the issues and then after a year went by I just got tired of sitting on my ass.\"\n\"The Bleeding\" was written by Moody about his ex-fianc\u00e9 and his former band Motograter.

Half of it is about my ex-fianc\u00e9 who meant everything to me, so once Motograter had fell apart and then her and I dwindled apart it just took a huge part of my life. So a lot of that song was about me losing that love and then having to say that it was over and move on. The other half was written about Motograter, because that was the closest thing I've ever had to a real family and it took a huge part of my soul.\"\nWhen Five Finger Death Punch performed a show in Arizona, the girl who Moody wrote \"The Bleeding\" about, his ex-fianc\u00e9, was at the show. It was the first time Moody saw her in about a year. Moody spoke about it, saying: \"...when we performed in Arizona the girl who I wrote \"The Bleeding\" for was at the show and that the first time I had seen her in about a year and I almost broke into tears because it all came rushing back to me. I'm not one of those artists that just likes to get up on stage and drink beer, when I sing a song I like to take myself and the fans back to the place where I was when I wrote that song.\"\nWhen Moody spoke about the first time he heard \"The Bleeding\", he said: \"When I first heard it, I sat back in my chair and almost cried. I mean, it came so naturally. Cause at the time, you know, I had just separated from my ex-fiancee and with Motograter separating, it was a real tragic time. A good friend of mine had just passed.

Potential contestants auditioned to be on the show. In each category, two selected contestants would compete, a champion and a challenger. The challenger would usually perform first, while the champion performed second. In later seasons, the champion performed first.\nAll acts were judged by a panel of four judges, and each judge could award an act from one to four stars (later changed to five stars).  Once both acts were complete, Ed would reveal the scores, and the best average won. If there was a tie, a studio audience vote broke the tie, in which case the results were revealed at the end of the show.\nAny performer must win at least several shows in a row, depending on the number of shows left in the season, to earn an entry into the next round of the competition; usually this was three or four wins in a row.  In later seasons, three-match winners were automatically retired. In this case, two new performers would compete in that category the following week.\nIn most seasons, two semifinal shows took place, one in the fall, the other in the spring, prior to the championship show.  Each semifinal used seven judges.  No scoring was used, and the judges' votes weren't revealed, but the acts that won their semifinals would then compete in the championship show.\nOn the championship show, winners of Male Vocalist, Female Vocalist, Vocal Group, Comedy, and Dance, were awarded $100,000 but no record contract was guaranteed.

Winners of Junior Vocalist, Junior Dance, Teen Vocalist, and Teen Dance win $10,000.\nIn early seasons, before the three match limit rule was adopted, the grand champions were determined by how long a champion held their title.  While it is believed that Sam Harris holds the record for longest championship, at 14 weeks in Season 1, Harris was actually defeated by singer Beau Williams on Harris' 14th attempt.

He was born with a severe hunchback, a bushy eyebrow covering his left eye while the right eye \"disappeared entirely\" behind a giant wart. He was born to a tribe of Romani people (in the novel called \u00e9gyptienne or 'gypsies'), but due to his monstrous appearance he was switched during infancy with an able-bodied baby girl, Agnes. One character in the novel refers to him as animalistic and un-Christian, suggesting he may be the \"offspring of a Jew and a sow\", and thus deserving of death. After being discovered, Quasimodo is exorcised by Agnes's mother (who believed that the Romani people ate her child) and taken to Paris. He is found abandoned in Notre Dame (on the foundlings' bed, where orphans and unwanted children are left to public charity) on Quasimodo Sunday, the First Sunday after Easter, by Claude Frollo, the Archdeacon of Notre Dame, who adopts the baby, names him after the day the baby was found, and brings him up to be the bell-ringer of the cathedral. Due to the loud ringing of the bells, Quasimodo also becomes deaf causing Frollo to teach him sign language. Although he is hated for his deformity, it is revealed that he is kind at heart. Though Quasimodo commits acts of violence in the novel, these are only undertaken when he is instructed by others.\n\nLooked upon by the general populace of Paris as a monster, he believes that Frollo is the only one who cares for him, and frequently accompanies him when the Archdeacon walks out of Notre Dame. Frollo lusts after a beautiful Romani girl named Esmeralda, and enlists Quasimodo in trying to kidnap her. (She is later revealed to be Agnes, the baby Quasimodo was switched with.) Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00e2teaupers arrives to stop the kidnapping and captures Quasimodo, unaware that Quasimodo was merely following Frollo's orders. The deaf judge Florian Barbedienne sentences him to an hour of flogging and another hour of humiliation on the pillory. Phoebus ties Quasimodo up and has Pierre Torterue whip him in front of a jeering crowd. When Quasimodo calls to him for help, Frollo allows Quasimodo to be tortured as punishment for failing him.  When Quasimodo calls for water, a child throws a wet rag at him. Seeing his thirst, Esmeralda approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him and she captures his heart.\nEsmeralda is later entangled in an attempted murder \u2013 committed by Frollo, who had stabbed Phoebus in a jealous rage after spying on Esmeralda and Phoebus having a night of passion \u2013 and is sentenced to be hanged. As she is being forced to pray at the steps of Notre Dame just before being marched off to the gallows, Quasimodo, who has been watching the occasion from an upper balcony in Notre Dame, slides down with a rope, and rescues her by taking her up to the top of the cathedral, where he poignantly shouts \"Sanctuary!\" to the onlookers below.\nEsmeralda is terrified of Quasimodo at first, but gradually recognizes his kind heart and becomes his friend. He watches over her and protects her, and at one point saves her from Frollo when the mad priest sexually assaults her in her room. In one instance Esmeralda also sees Phoebus from the cathedral balcony and pleadingly convinces Quasimodo to go down and look for him, but Phoebus is repulsed by Quasimodo's appearance and refuses to visit Notre Dame to see her.\nAfter an uneasy respite, a mob of Paris's Truands led by Clopin Trouillefou storms Notre Dame, and although Quasimodo tries to fend them off by throwing stones and bricks down onto the mob and even pours deadly molten lead, the mob continues attacking until Phoebus and his soldiers arrive to fight and drive off the assailants. Unbeknownst to Quasimodo, Frollo lures Esmeralda outside, where he has her arrested and hanged. When Quasimodo sees Frollo smiling cruelly at Esmeralda's execution, he turns on his master and throws him to his death from the balcony in rage.\nQuasimodo cries in despair, lamenting \"There is all that I ever loved!\" He then leaves Notre Dame, never to return, and heads for the Gibbet of Montfaucon beyond the city walls, passing by the Convent of the Filles-Dieu, a home for 200 reformed prostitutes, and the leper colony of Saint-Lazare. After reaching the Gibbet, he lies next to Esmeralda's corpse, where it had been unceremoniously thrown after the execution. He stays at Montfaucon, and eventually dies of starvation, clutching the body of the deceased Esmeralda. Years later, an excavation group exhumes both of their skeletons, which have become intertwined. When they try to separate them, Quasimodo's bones crumble to dust.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Cheap Trick version was eventually released on John Lennon Anthology, albeit without an overdubbed guitar part played by Nielsen.\"I'm Losing You\" was first recorded with the Double Fantasy session musicians on 18 August 1980, but Lennon was dissatisfied with this performance, and thus a third recording was made on 26 August, which was released on Double Fantasy.

As a composer he acted as a bridge between the 19th-century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect, which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era. After 1945 his compositions were rediscovered by a new generation of listeners; Mahler then became one of the most frequently performed and recorded of all composers, a position he has sustained into the 21st century.\nBorn in Bohemia (then part of the Austrian Empire) to Jewish parents of humble origins, the German-speaking Mahler displayed his musical gifts at an early age. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler\u2014who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post\u2014experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky. Late in his life he was briefly director of New York's Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic.\nMahler's \u0153uvre is relatively limited; for much of his life composing was necessarily a part-time activity while he earned his living as a conductor. Aside from early works such as a movement from a piano quartet composed when he was a student in Vienna, Mahler's works are generally designed for large orchestral forces, symphonic choruses and operatic soloists. These works were frequently controversial when first performed, and several were slow to receive critical and popular approval; exceptions included his Second Symphony, and the triumphant premiere of his Eighth Symphony in 1910. Some of Mahler's immediate musical successors included the composers of the Second Viennese School, notably Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg and Anton Webern. Dmitri Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten are among later 20th-century composers who admired and were influenced by Mahler. The International Gustav Mahler Society was established in 1955 to honour the composer's life and achievements.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He built at least two of them, in slightly different patterns, as evidenced in photographs and film footage of his performances.\nAs a one-man band, Fuller wanted to supply a more substantial accompaniment than the typical high-hat (cymbal) or bass drum used by other street musicians. His solution was the fotdella, a foot-operated percussion bass, consisting of an upright wood box, shaped like the top of a double bass, with a short neck at the top, and six piano bass strings attached to the neck and stretched down over the body. The strings were played by means of six piano or organ pedals, each connected to a padded piano hammer which struck a string. Removing his shoe and placing his sock-covered foot in a rotating heel cradle, Fuller played the six pedals of the fotdella like a piano. With the instrument's six notes, he could play bass lines in several keys. He occasionally played without it, if a song exceeded its limited range.The name was coined by his wife, who took to calling the instrument a \"foot-diller\" (a \"killer-diller\" instrument played with the foot), which was shortened to fotdella.

They also booked more modern acts such as Alice Cooper, Chicago, and the Doors.On 12 September, Brower contacted Lennon, who was still a member of the Beatles, to ask him to be the master of ceremonies for the festival. Instead, Lennon offered to perform at the show with a new group, the Plastic Ono Band.\" Brower readily agreed, but since Lennon did not actually have a new group, he quickly began making phone calls to potential members to accompany himself and Yoko Ono. He initially approached Beatles band-mate George Harrison to play lead guitar, but Harrison declined, so Lennon turned to Eric Clapton, who had previously performed with Lennon in the one-off super group, the Dirty Mac. Bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Alan White soon agreed to perform, along with their assistants, Anthony Fawcett, Terry Doran, and Jill and Dan Richter. Voormann was a long-time friend of Lennon, but White, who was a respected session musician in London but did not know Lennon personally, initially thought that someone was prank calling him and only believed that the real John Lennon was on the phone when he called a second time.The group was scheduled to fly to Toronto on 12 September, the day before the concert, but Lennon, Ono, and Clapton were late to arrive at the airport. Lennon had talked to Clapton's management, but Clapton himself did not yet know that Lennon had invited him to perform and was not even aware of the concert. Brower managed to reach Clapton personally and told him to contact Lennon and Ono, who were still in bed.

When Yankovic was young, his father moved to Cleveland to escape authorities who learned of his bootlegging, and the rest of the family followed shortly thereafter. While living in Cleveland, he became enthralled by the brass bands that played at Slovenian social functions. His mother took on boarders to help with the family finances, including a man named Max Zelodec who performed Slovenian tunes on a button box. Yankovic acquired an accordion at age 9, and received a few lessons from Zelodec. By the late 1920s, in his early teenage years, he was a working musician, playing for community events. In the 1930s, he formed a business relationship with Joe Trolli and began making radio appearances on stations such as WJAY and WGAR. As his reputation spread, he sought opportunities to make records, but the major labels turned him down. His first records were made for the Yankee and Joliet labels operated by Fred Wolf, and the expenses were paid for by Yankovic himself.In 1940, he married his first wife June, and they began to raise a family. However, the expenses of family life quickly overcame the incoming money from his music career, so he opened a tavern, calling it the Yankovic Bar. It became a popular hangout for local musicians, and he continued to run it until he sold it in 1948, dedicating himself to the accordion.Yankovic enlisted in the armed forces in 1943 and cut numerous records while on leave, prior to his departure for Europe. Yankovic was assigned duty in 1943 in the infantry as a flame-thrower operator. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge where a severe case of frostbite nearly required the amputation of his hands and feet. Fortunately, he was able to beat the resulting gangrene before that became necessary, and was awarded a Purple Heart. The doctors urged him to have his fingers amputated, but he refused, as that would have ended his music career. After getting out of the hospital, he and four other musicians were assigned to special services to entertain the troops, including General George Patton and his Third United States Army.Yankovic hit the national scene when he earned two platinum singles for \"Just Because\" (1947) and \"Blue Skirt Waltz\" (1949). Others who recorded the Blue Skirt Waltz were the Tunemixers and Guy Lombardo both in 1949, Lawrence Welk (Myron Floren) in 1958, Jim Ed Brown and the Browns in 1960, Hank Thompson in 1962, and Bobby Vinton in 1976. Yankovic found a Bohemian Waltz called \"Cervenou Sukynku,\" (written by Vaclav Blaha) or loosely translated, \"Red Skirt Waltz.\" Yankovic asked Mitchell Parrish (\"Stardust\", \"Sleighride\") to write new lyrics to the melody. Parrish changed \"red\" to \"blue\". Yankovic sold over 2.5 million records and with the Tunemixers version and Guy Lombardo's version, it sold over 4 million records total in 1949. It was the second Cleveland-style song to sell over one million recordings.\nColumbia Records initially refused to record \"Just Because\", because other versions of the song had been around for years without much success; only allowing it when Yankovic said that he would buy the first 10,000 records. Yankovic obtained the title of America's Polka King after beating Louis Bashell, Romy Gosz, Harold Loeffelmacher and the Six Fat Dutchmen, Whoopee John Wilfahrt, and Lawrence Duchow in a battle of the bands in Milwaukee at the Milwaukee Arena on June 9, 1948.In 1950, he made his Hollywood debut and collaborated with Doris Day as a singer.In 1970, a house fire destroyed the gold records for \"Just Because\" and \"Blue Skirt Waltz\".Yankovic also hosted the television series Polka Time for Buffalo, New York-based WKBW-TV for 26 weeks in 1962. He commuted from Cleveland to host each episode, which aired live. He also hosted a similar show at WGN-TV Chicago at about the same time.\nHe won a Grammy Award in 1986 for his album 70 Years of Hits. He was the first winner in the Polka category. The NARAS (Grammy) organization dropped the category in 2008.He performed with musical comedian and fellow accordionist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, although the two are not related. Al, who also performs polka music among many other styles, has jokingly hypothesized that he was given accordion lessons as a child because his parents thought that \"there should be at least one more accordion-playing Yankovic in the world.\" Al performed accordion on \"Who Stole the Kishka?\" on one of Frankie's final records, Songs of the Polka King, Vol. 1. A portion of Frankie's \"The Tick Tock Polka\" is included in the song \"Polka Face\" on Weird Al's Alpocalypse; it was used as a lead-in for Weird Al's take on \"Tik Tok\" by Ke$ha.", "hasanswer": false}]}

RCB differs from most brass bands, however, in that its instrumentation has been altered. French Horns are used instead of alto horns, and an Eb soprano trumpet is employed in place of a soprano cornet, creating a lighter, brighter, more \"orchestral\" sound than the traditional brass band.On November 21, 1981, the RCB performed under the baton of conductor Robert Bernat at the Carnegie Music Hall in Pittsburgh during its inaugural concert. Among the performers during that first RCB concert were British musicians Robert Childs, a renowned euphonium performer with the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, and Arthur Taylor, a British brass band concert producer who served as the master of ceremonies for the RCB event. Enid Hattersley, then lord mayor of Sheffield, England, Pittsburgh's sister city, also participated, and was described by one area newspaper as \"feisty and funny.\"Since that time, the ensemble has been a featured performer at the Adelaide Festival of the Arts (Australia), Musikfest (Pennsylvania), Chautauqua Institution (New York), New Zealand International Festival of the Arts, Interlochen Center for the Arts (Michigan), and Thalian Hall (North Carolina), among many other venues across the United States and world.According to the ensemble's website, \u201cThe mission of the River City Brass is to propagate and perpetuate musical culture, primarily American musical culture, across a broad spectrum of the public through the presentation of brass band performances, educational programs and the production of recordings.

It just got to the point where we didn't enjoy what we were doing anymore. There was no love for the music and no love for being on stage with one another, so it just seemed like we were constantly battling one another for different things.

Half of it is about my ex-fianc\u00e9 who meant everything to me, so once Motograter had fell apart and then her and I dwindled apart it just took a huge part of my life. So a lot of that song was about me losing that love and then having to say that it was over and move on.

I mean, it came so naturally. Cause at the time, you know, I had just separated from my ex-fiancee and with Motograter separating, it was a real tragic time. A good friend of mine had just passed.

Her performances at local competitions led to a meeting with local theater producer Monica Ariza, who later held an audition for her in Bogot\u00e1. She performed three songs for executives of Sony Music Colombia, who were impressed enough to sign her, at the age of 13, to record three albums, which were Magia, Peligro and Pies Descalzos.The low-budget Magia was put in almost three months of pre-production, which involved choreography of live performances for the album, singing lessons for Shakira, and arranging the songs. The concept of the music still reflected her personality, despite the fact that it was managed by the record label. The tracks deal with emotions of a person's first time falling in love, and range from a love poem (\"Sue\u00f1os\") to a celebration of dance (\"Esta noche voy contigo\"). These were influenced from experiences with males such as her ex-boyfriend Oscar Pardo, stories told by her father, and dreams of living on the coast. In the book Shakira: Woman Full of Grace, Ximena Diego wrote that the album \"demonstrated her [Shakira's] indisputable potential.\"Magia is a collection of songs written by Shakira between the ages of 8 and 12, and mainly consists of pop ballads. It was produced by Miguel E. Cubillos and Pablo Tedeschi, and recorded at Aga Studios in Bogot\u00e1, when Shakira was 13.

From 1991 to 1994, she had a recurring role as Reed, the daughter of Alex (Swoosie Kurtz), on the NBC drama Sisters.\nShe made her feature film debut with a small role in 1992's Kuffs. In 1993, she was cast in her first starring role playing the title character in Victor Nu\u00f1ez's Ruby in Paradise. This won the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize. Believing that this role would shape the rest of her career, Judd was extremely nervous before the audition, nearly getting into a car accident en route. \"From the first three sentences, I knew it was written for me\", she told the San Jose Mercury News. She received rave reviews in her role as Ruby Lee Gissing, a young woman trying to make a new life for herself.Nu\u00f1ez told biographer James L. Dickerson that Judd created the resonance of this character: \"The resonance, those moments, was not contrived. It was just a matter of creating the scene and trusting that it was worth telling.\"Oliver Stone, who had seen Judd in Nu\u00f1ez's film, cast her in Natural Born Killers, but her scenes were cut from the version of the film released theatrically. The following year, she gained critical acclaim for her role as Harvey Keitel's estranged daughter in Wayne Wang's Smoke and as Val Kilmer's wife in Michael Mann's Heat. That same year she played the role of Callie in Philip Ridley's dark adult fairy tale The Passion of Darkly Noon.In 1996, she co-starred with Mira Sorvino as Marilyn Monroe in Norma Jean and Marilyn, where she recreated the photo shoot for the centerfold for the first issue of Playboy. The same year she had a supporting role in the thriller film A Time to Kill. It received positive reviews and was a major box office success. By the end of the 1990s, Judd had achieved considerable success as a leading actress, having lead roles in additional thrillers that performed well at the box office, including Kiss the Girls (1997) and Double Jeopardy (1999).In the early 2000s she starred in Where the Heart Is (2000), Someone Like You (2001), and High Crimes (2002). These were moderate box office successes. Her film Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002) performed well. In 2002 she acted in the critically acclaimed film Frida.Judd played the role of Maggie the Cat in the 2003 Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.In 2004 she received praise and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, for her performance in De-Lovely, opposite Kevin Kline, who played Cole Porter. She also starred in Twisted (2004). This was widely panned.In 2010, Judd was Janet Tamaro's original choice for the role of Detective Jane Rizzoli in the TV series Rizzoli & Isles but she declined. Angie Harmon took the role. In 2011, Judd co-starred with Patrick Dempsey in the film Flypaper. In 2012, she starred as Rebecca Winstone on the ABC series Missing. In 2014, she appeared as Natalie Prior in Divergent, which she reprised in the 2015 sequel Insurgent.\nIn 2014, Judd was the narrator of the documentary film about Turkish preacher Fethullah G\u00fclen, Love Is a Verb, directed by Terry Spencer Hesser.

Shortly after its release, Philpot assembled a band lineup including Sadek Bazarra on keyboards and guitar, David Daniell (of San Agustin) on guitar, James Elliott (also of Ateleia and School of Seven Bells) on bass, and Adam Wills on guitar. Drummer Joe Stickney (formerly of Perpetual Groove, who later played with Warm Ghost, Rhys Chatham and Panthers) was then added to the lineup. Daniell left in 2005 to focus on his solo project.\nIn 2006, Bear in Heaven participated in a Take Away Shows video session shot by Vincent Moon.\nRed Bloom of the Boom, Bear in Heaven's first full-length album with the full band, was released November 6, 2007, on their own Hometapes record label.\nElliott left the band after the completion of the Red Bloom recordings to focus on School of Seven Bells and his solo project, Ateleia.

Beast Rest Forth Mouth received the \"Best New Music\" award from Pitchfork, with the reviewer stating: \"Beast Rest Forth Mouth is as familiar-feeling as it is difficult to pinpoint. Mostly made up of textural, spacious three- to four-minute pop anthems with towering choruses, BRFM is a welcome reminder that an album doesn't have to be bombastic to feel huge and important. Take out the earbuds and let it fill a space: This is music that's bigger than your iPod\u2014music you'll want to feel all around you. Though not quite coming out of nowhere, BRFM seems like a surprise gift\u2014a striking consolidation of the spiky psych-prog tendencies of their debut into a pop framework\".On August 23, 2010, the band issued an album of remixes, Beast Rest Forth Mouth Remixed, on Dreamboat Records/Hometapes.\nBazarra left the band after a March 2011 tour.

It was then previewed normally on March 26 by NPR, who said, \"For all of Bear in Heaven's tongue-in-cheek marketing savvy, its songs are sweet, reasonably simple and charmingly buzzy, with each whirring synth wrapped around a core of pure pop\". The album was released by Dead Oceans/Hometapes on April 3, 2012.\nFollowing Stickney's departure in 2012, Philpot and Wills teamed up with New York City session drummer Jason Nazary to begin work on a fourth studio album, Time Is Over One Day Old, released on August 5, 2014, again on Dead Oceans/Hometapes. Drowned in Sound reviewed the album positively, noting: \"After the restless frenzy of 2012's I Love You, It's Cool, Jon Philpot's Brooklyn collective Bear in Heaven return with something of a masterclass in fourth album rejuvenation. As a band whose sound has remained impossible to trace to a single touchstone, their only consistency is a love of sonic density and Philpot's thick, dulcet vocals.

As a true freshman in the 1995 NCAA Division I-A football season, Streets only caught five passes for the 1995 Michigan Wolverines football team: he caught three in the 52\u201317 October 28 Little Brown Jug rivalry game victory against the Minnesota Golden Gophers and two in the 31\u201323 November 25 Michigan \u2013 Ohio State rivalry game with the Ohio State Buckeyes.  All five athletes who had more receptions than him that season went on to play professional football (Mercury Hayes \u2212 48, Amani Toomer \u2013 44, Jay Riemersma \u2013 41, Chris Howard \u2013 14 and Jerame Tuman \u2013 9).  Hayes, Toomer and Riemersma, who accounted for 75 percent of the team's yardage, were all selected in the 1996 NFL Draft, leaving Streets as the leading returning wide receiver (Howard was a running back and Tuman was a tight end).In 1996, Michigan dealt with a starting quarterback returning from a season-ending injury and a depleted receiving group: Scott Dreisbach had missed the final two-thirds of the season, leaving Brian Griese as the starter and freshman Tom Brady served as an understudy.  Streets earned the starting wide receiver job and started in all twelve games.  He led the 1996 Michigan Wolverines football team in receptions and reception yardage with 44 receptions for 730 yards.  In the first game of the season against Illinois, Streets made the key block on Dreisbach's 72-yard touchdown run.  Two weeks later he made key catches on both the game-tying and game-winning scoring drives against the Colorado Buffaloes.  His best statistical performance came at home in Cook County, Illinois in front of a large gathering of friends and family against Northwestern when he recorded 12 receptions for 150 yards in an October 5, 17\u201316 loss.  This first appearance in the Chicago area would be his collegiate career-best in terms of single-game receptions.  The 12 receptions was a school record, but it was overshadowed by a fumble that changed the momentum of the game. Streets caught two touchdown passes both in rivalry games: the opening score from Dreisbach in the 44\u201310 victory against Minnesota and the only touchdown in a 13\u20139 victory over Ohio State from Griese.  In his sophomore year, after the football season ended with the January 1, 1997 Outback Bowl game, he joined the Michigan Wolverines basketball team in the last week of January and made his debut in a February 1, 1997 game against Michigan State.  The team went on to win the 1997 National Invitation Tournament on March 27 that season, and Streets played a few minutes in four of the five games.  However, due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal the championship has been vacated.  After the basketball season ended, Streets rejoined the football team for Spring practice, and he led all receivers with four receptions for 125 yards in the annual spring game on April 12.According to his mother, during the summer prior to his 1997 junior year, Streets dedicated himself to weight training like he never had before in an effort to end a Rose Bowl draught that made the 1997 Wolverines the first since the 1969 team to have no Rose Bowl veterans.  Although Streets and Russell Shaw were the starting receivers, it was understood that Charles Woodson, who was regarded as one of the most versatile athletes in college football, was expected to play on offense that season. However, it was not clear whether Dreisbach, Brady or Griese would quarterback the team. Griese was named starter shortly before the season opener.  It was believed that a solid season by any of the quarterbacks could lead to a productive season by Streets and the receivers. Streets' first touchdown of the season was a 41-yard game-tying catch from Griese in a 21\u201314 September 27 victory in the rivalry game against Notre Dame.  During the season, Streets dislocated both thumbs, with the second injury occurring in the November 1 Little Brown Jug game against Minnesota.  Streets caught no passes against either Minnesota or Penn State the following week.  His production drought was notable and he recovered on November 15 with five catches for 108 yards including a 38-yard touchdown from Griese on November 15 against Wisconsin.  Although the injury-hampered Streets went without a catch in three of the last four regular season games he caught touchdown passes of 53 and 58 yards and drew a key pass interference penalty in the 1998 Rose Bowl.  The Rose Bowl performance was Streets' season-high with 127 receiving yards and two touchdowns.  It helped solidify Michigan's case as the Bowl Alliance national champion.In 1998, Streets' returned for his senior season with several experienced receivers including 1997 All-American tight end Tuman.  The 1998 Michigan Wolverines football team entered the season with a quarterback battle between Brady, Driesbach and Drew Henson and wide receiver battle between David Terrell and Marquise Walker. In the season September 5 opening game loss against Notre Dame, Streets caught 8 passes for 101 yards in the first half and Marcus Knight accounted for 126 of Michigan's 322 passing yards from Brady and Henson.  Streets had back-to-back 100 yard games in October: He posted 117 yards on eight receptions in the October 24 homecoming game against Indiana, and he had a career-high 192 yards against Minnesota on October 31. Against Ohio State, he caught Michigan's only touchdown in a 31\u201316 November 21 loss as part of a 9 catch and 118 yard effort. In the game-tying touchdown drive in the fourth quarter of the 1999 Florida Citrus Bowl victory over Arkansas, Streets caught a 15-yard completion on third-and-11 and the 8-yarder on fourth-and-2 on his way to a career-ending 7-catch 129-yard effort.  Streets caught a fourth-quarter touchdown pass and two-point conversion in the January 23, 1999 Senior Bowl, and he was on the January 24, 1999 Hula Bowl roster.As a senior, Streets totalled 1035 yards and 11 touchdowns on 76 receptions, and he was named team Most Valuable Player for the 1998 season.  Streets was voted to the All-Big Ten Second Team in 1998.  Streets remains second to Jack Clancy on the all-time Michigan single game receptions yardage list with 192. Streets led the Michigan receivers statistically for three consecutive years from 1996 \u2013 1998 (Yards 1996\u20131998, Receptions 1996 & 1998, Receiving touchdowns 1997\u20131998).  Streets finished his career at Michigan with 2284 yards and 19 touchdowns on 144 receptions.At the March NFL Combine, Streets ran the third fastest 40-yard dash in a time of 4.42 seconds. Streets was regarded as between the 6th and 8th best wide receiver in the 1999 NFL Draft according to most expert analyses in April.  However, he ruptured his right achilles tendon in a pickup basketball game prior to the draft and was expected to be sidelined for six to eight months. As a result, he was the twentieth wide receiver selected.  Streets, who was on crutches at the time of the draft, was relieved to have been drafted.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Turkish fleet of around 15 ships of the line plus frigates and galleys which they met near Chesma Bay, western Turkey, was much superior to the Russian force of 9 ships of the line and 3 frigates. After a severe and sanguinary but indecisive battle, the Turkish fleet retired during the night close into Chesma Bay, where they were protected by batteries on land. Notwithstanding the formidable position which the enemy had taken up, the Russian admiral determined to pursue, and if possible destroy these by means of his fire-ships.\nAt one o\u2019clock in the morning, Captain Greig bore down upon the enemy with his fire ships and succeeded in totally destroying the Turkish fleet. Captain Greig, on this occasion assisted by another British officer, a Lieutenant Drysdale, who acted under him, set the match to the fire ships with his own hands. This perilous duty performed, he and Drysdale leaped overboard and swam to their own boats, under a tremendous fire from the Turks, and at the imminent hazard besides of being destroyed by the explosion of their own fire ships. Following up this success, the Russian fleet now attacked the town and batteries on shore, and by nine o\u2019clock in the morning there was scarcely a vestige remaining of the town, fortifications, or fleet. For this important service, Captain Greig, who had been appointed commodore on his being placed in command of the fire-ships, was immediately promoted by Count Orlov to the rank of admiral, an appointment which was confirmed by an express from the Empress of Russia.\nA peace was soon afterward concluded between the two powers, but this circumstance did not lessen the importance of Admiral Greig's services to the government by which he was employed. He continued indefatigable in his exertions in improving the Russian fleet, remodeling its code of discipline, and by his example infusing a spirit into every department of its economy, which finally made it one of the most formidable marines in Europe. These important services were fully appreciated by the empress, who rewarded them by promoting Greig to the high rank of admiral of the Russian Empire, and governor of Kronstadt.

{"id": "175_839", "question": "Who performed The Rivalry?", "ctxs": [{"id": "800_29862", "text": "In the 1780s, while Mozart lived and worked in Vienna, he and his father Leopold wrote in their letters that several \"cabals\" of Italians led by Salieri were actively putting obstacles in the way of Mozart's obtaining certain posts or staging his operas. For example, Mozart wrote in December 1781 to his father that \"the only one who counts in the Emperor's eyes is Salieri\". Their letters suggest that both Mozart and his father, being Austrians who resented the special place that Italian composers had in the courts of the Austrian nobility, blamed the Italians in general and Salieri in particular for all of Mozart's difficulties in establishing himself in Vienna. Mozart wrote to his father in May 1783 about Salieri and Lorenzo Da Ponte, the court poet: \"You know those Italian gentlemen; they are very nice to your face! Enough, we all know about them. And if Da Ponte is in league with Salieri, I'll never get a text from him, and I would love to show him what I can really do with an Italian opera.\" In July 1783, he again wrote to his father of \"a trick of Salieri's\", one of several letters in which Mozart accused Salieri of trickery.\nDecades after Mozart's death, a rumor began to circulate that Mozart had been poisoned by Salieri. This rumor has been attributed by some to a rivalry between the German and the Italian schools of music. Carl Maria von Weber, a relative of Mozart by marriage whom Wagner has characterized as the most German of German composers, is said to have refused to join the Ludlamsh\u00f6hle (Ludlam's cave), a social club of which Salieri was a member, and avoided having anything to do with him. These rumors then made their way into popular culture. Albert Lortzing's Singspiel Szenen aus Mozarts Leben LoWV28 (1832) and the popular 1984 film Amadeus uses the clich\u00e9 of the jealous Salieri trying to hinder Mozart's career.\nIronically, Salieri's music was much more in the tradition of Gluck and Gassmann than of the Italians like Paisiello or Cimarosa. In 1772, Empress Maria Theresa commented on her preference for Italian composers over Germans like Gassmann, Salieri, or Gluck. While Italian by birth, Salieri had lived in imperial Vienna for almost 60 years and was regarded by such people as the music critic Friedrich Rochlitz as a German composer.The biographer Alexander Wheelock Thayer believes that Mozart's rivalry with Salieri could have originated with an incident in 1781, when Mozart applied to be the music teacher of Princess Elisabeth of W\u00fcrttemberg, and Salieri was selected instead because of his reputation as a singing teacher.  The following year Mozart once again failed to be selected as the princess's piano teacher. \"Salieri and his tribe will move heaven and earth to put it down\", Leopold Mozart wrote to his daughter Nannerl. But at the time of the premiere of Figaro, Salieri was busy with his new French opera Les Horaces. In addition, when Lorenzo Da Ponte was in Prague preparing the production of Mozart's setting of his Don Giovanni, the poet was ordered back to Vienna for a royal wedding for which Salieri's Axur, re d'Ormus would be performed. Obviously, Mozart was not pleased by this.\nThe rivalry between Salieri and Mozart became publicly visible as well as audible during the opera composition competition held by Emperor Joseph II in 1786 in the Orangery at Sch\u00f6nbrunn. Mozart was considered the loser of this competition. Mozart's 1791 opera The Magic Flute echoes that competition because the Papageno\u2013Papagena duet is similar to the Cucuzza cavatina in Salieri's Prima la musica e poi le parole. The Magic Flute also echoes Salieri's music in that Papageno's whistle is based on a motif borrowed from Salieri's Concerto for Clavicembalo in B-flat major.However, there is also evidence attesting to Mozart and Salieri sometimes appearing to support each other's work. For example, when Salieri was appointed Kapellmeister in 1788, he chose to revive Figaro instead of introducing a new opera of his own, and when he attended the coronation festivities for Leopold II in 1790, Salieri had no fewer than three Mozart masses in his luggage. Salieri and Mozart even jointly composed a cantata for voice and piano, Per la ricuperata salute di Ofelia, which celebrated the return to the stage of the singer Nancy Storace. This work, although it had been printed by Artaria in 1785, was considered lost until 10 January 2016, when the Schw\u00e4bische Zeitung reported on the discovery by musicologist and composer Timo Jouko Herrmann of a copy of its text and music while doing research on Antonio Salieri in the collections of the Czech Museum of Music. Mozart's Davide penitente (1785), his Piano Concerto KV 482 (1785), the Clarinet Quintet (1789) and the 40th Symphony (1788) had been premiered on the suggestion of Salieri, who supposedly conducted a performance of it in 1791.

{"id": "175_840", "question": "Who performed Born Again?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_7449", "text": "According to Iommi's autobiography, Ward began drinking again near the end of the Born Again recording sessions and returned to Los Angeles for treatment.  The band recruited Bev Bevan, who had played with The Move and ELO, for the upcoming tour in support of the new album.  Gillan had all the lyrics to the Sabbath songs written out and plastered all over the stage, explaining to Martin Baker in 1992, \"I couldn't get into my brain any of these lyrics...I cannot soak in these words.  There's no storyline. I can't relate to what they mean.\"  Gillan attempted to overcome the problem by having a cue book with plastic pages on stage, which he would turn with his foot during the show.  However, Gillan did not anticipate the \"six buckets\" of dry ice that engulfed the stage, making it impossible for the singer to see the lyric sheets.  \"Ian wasn't very sure-footed either,\" Iommi writes in his memoir.  \"He once fell over my pedal board.  He was waving at the people, stepped back and, bang!, he went arse over head big time.\"  Gillan also told Birch that it was Don Arden's idea to open the show with a crying baby blaring over the speakers and a dwarf made to look exactly like the demonic baby depicted on the Born Again album cover miming to the screaming.  \"We noticed a dwarf walking around the day before the opening show...And we're saying to Don, 'We think this is in the worst possible taste, this dwarf, you know?'  And Don's going, 'Nah, the kids will love it, it'll be great.'\"\nThe tour is most infamous, however, for the gigantic Stonehenge props the band used.  Iommi recalls in his autobiography that it was Butler's idea but the designers took his measurements the wrong way and thought it was meant to be life-size.  Months later, while rehearsing for the tour at the Birmingham NEC, the stage set arrived.  \"We were in shock,\" writes Iommi.  \"This stuff was coming in and in and in.  It had all these huge columns in the back that were as wide as your average bedroom, the columns in front were about 13 feet high, and we had all the monitors and the side fills as well as all this rock.  It was made of fiberglass and wood, and bloody heavy.\" The set would be lampooned in Rob Reiner's 1984 rock music mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, with the band having the opposite problem of having to use miniature Stonehenge stage props.  Butler has said that he told the associate scriptwriter of the film the story of the band's performances with their \"Stonehenge\" stage props. In an interview for the documentary Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992, Gillan claims Don Arden had the dwarf walk across the top of the Stonehenge props at the start of the show and, as the tape of the screaming baby faded away, fall back \"from about thirty-five feet in the air on this big pile of mattresses.  And then, 'Dong!' The bells start and the monks come out, the whole thing.  Pure Spinal Tap.\"  The band toured Europe first, playing the Reading Festival (a performance that is included on the 2011 deluxe edition of Born Again) and also playing in a bullring in Barcelona in September.  Sabbath performed Gillan's hit with Deep Purple, \"Smoke on the Water\", on the tour, with Iommi explaining in his memoir, \"it seemed like a bum deal for him not to do any of his stuff while he was doing all of ours.  I don't know if we played it properly but the audience loved it.  The critics moaned; it was something out of the bag and they didn't want to know then.\"  In October, the band took the Stonehenge set to America but could only use a portion of it at most gigs because the columns were too high. The set was eventually abandoned.  A music video for \"Zero the Hero\" was also released, featuring performance footage of the band onstage interspersed with scenes involving several grotesque characters performing experiments on a witless young man in a haunted house filled with rats, roosters and a roaming horse.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Moving from place to place, he performed at open-mic nights across the United Kingdom, where he would sleep on his friends' sofas spending time self-releasing homemade EPs and albums. After spending four years performing in the British live scene, Sheeran met singer Jamie Foxx in Los Angeles, and Foxx liked Sheeran enough to \"put [Sheeran] on the path to success\".In early 2010, Sheeran was having what he described as a \"rough time\" in the UK, and he spontaneously left for Los Angeles to spend a month \"to see what could happen\". After performing a gig in the city, he was approached by Foxx's contact, who produced open-mic nights endorsed by Foxx.

Included is the period he lived with his unstable grandmother, during which time he reports fragmentary memories of sexual abuse at the hands of her suitors. Townshend discusses the Mod scene of the 1960s, the effect the war had on his generation, and the development of rock music. He also discusses the effect his childhood had on his music, particularly the rock opera Tommy.The book traces the formation and evolution of the Who, and includes details of their appearance at Woodstock in 1969 and their storied trashing of hotels. Townshend calls Roger Daltrey \"the unquestionable leader\" of the band. He says he started smashing his guitars at the end of performances after he accidentally pushed one through a club ceiling in 1964 and damaged it. His \"windmill\" style of striking guitar chords was adopted from Keith Richards, whom Townshend says he once saw swinging his arm to warm-up before going on stage.The book also includes the many encounters Townshend had with other rock musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, whom he called a shaman because of the way he played his guitar. Townshend says that in a way Hendrix's \"performances did borrow from mine \u2013 the feedback, the distortion, the guitar theatrics,\" but he added that Hendrix's \"artistic genius lay in how he created a sound all his own\". Townshend recalls that at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival the Who and Hendrix argued backstage as to who would play first, and Townshend won after a coin flip.Townshend describes himself in the book as \"probably bisexual\" because of a brief affair he had with journalist Danny Fields and his interest in Mick Jagger, saying \"Mick is the only man I've ever seriously wanted to fuck\". Keith Moon and John Entwistle felt that Townshend was too prudish around groupies and once paid one $100 to infect him with gonorrhea. Townshend says he tried to distance himself from rock stardom as much as possible. He studied the works of Indian spiritual master and mystic Meher Baba, and while he was able to avoid drugs and extramarital sex most of the time, Townshend says he periodically lapsed and indulged in cocaine and alcohol.The book details Townshend's work as an editor at London publisher Faber and Faber, some of the literary personalities he worked with, and some the books he commissioned. It also covers his charity work in rehabilitation programs and establishing a shelter for battered wives. In 2003 Townshend was arrested for allegedly downloading child pornography. In the book he claims that he accessed the images as research for a campaign against the presence of such images, and was helping to set up \"a research program for a new support system for survivors of childhood abuse\". He was later given a formal police caution. Townshend wrote that he had accepted the caution only because \"I was in no frame of mind to live through another eternity \u2013 this time in court\", although he later wished he had gone to trial to prove his innocence.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Looking for a new, creative sound, Rothchild hired Paul Harris to arrange string and orchestral arrangements for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and local jazz horn players. Session musicians Doug Lubahn and Harvey Brooks also served as additional bass guitarists. The music on The Soft Parade incorporated psychedelic rock, blues rock, art rock, jazz rock, pop rock and experimental styles. Drummer John Densmore and Manzarek, who both had jazz backgrounds, asserted they were receptive to Rothchild's jazz concept: \"We'd [Densmore and Manzarek] always talk about using some jazz musicians \u2013 let's put some horns and strings on, man, let's see what it would be like to record with a string section and a big horn section,\" recalled Manzarek.Although Morrison was less involved in the Doors' studio sessions at this point, he demanded the band receive individual writing credits after initially refusing to sing Krieger's lyric, \"Can't you see me growing, get your guns\" on the track \"Tell All the People\". As a result, The Soft Parade was the first Doors album to list band members separately rather than collectively as \"Songs by the Doors.\" Krieger continued to hone his songwriting skills to fill the void left by Morrison's absence. He wrote half of the album's tracks, while Morrison is credited with the other half (they share co-credits on \"Do It\"), ultimately creating an album that lacks the unified musical stance found in the Doors' early works.Krieger's songs, written almost independently from the rest of the band, most noticeably incorporated the jazz influences. Only his tracks, \"Tell All the People\", \"Touch Me\", \"Runnin' Blue\", and \"Wishful Sinful\", were written to include string and horn arrangements; Morrison, though not totally opposed to the concept, declined to go in the direction Densmore and Manzarek championed. \"Touch Me\" (penned under the working titles \"Hit Me\" and \"I'm Gonna Love You\") was chosen as the first single taken from The Soft Parade, becoming one of the Doors' biggest hits. The band brought in the saxophone player Curtis Amy to perform a solo instrumental on the song, which was influenced by the works of John Coltrane.Journalists Nathan Brackett and Christian Hoard found \"Wild Child\" as \"Morrison parodying himself.\" \"Shaman's Blues\" and the title track were both examples of the singer's penchant for using symbolism and autobiographical insights. The latter song, a stylistic return to a lengthy track closing a Doors album, was penned with the help of Rothchild, who organized pieces of Morrison's poetry with him to align rhythmically and conceptually. Introduced with a mock-fiery sermon by Morrison, \"The Soft Parade\" displays his Southern roots through his portrayal as a preacher. The song's ambiance is heightened by the striking imagery which outlines a need for sanctuary, escape, and pleasure. Critic Doug Sundling noted that \"The Soft Parade\", with its display of funk, jazz, acid rock and psychedelic pop influences, is more diverse than any other composition of the group.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Shortly after this, the band played a one-off show in Brighouse, Yorkshire on 15 August 2004 to celebrate their 10th anniversary, which saw the debut of material from Out of Nothing. They appeared a V Festival a few days later after Jet pulled out because of a death in the family. Shortly after this, Embrace partially played a fan club gig in London that was ultimately shut down by the police. They promoted the \"Gravity\" single with a one-off show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire venue in London, prior to the release of Out of Nothing on 13 September 2004. The artwork shows the members of the band embracing one another.To promote the album, the band told fans via text messages about secret gigs they were holding, one of which including a performance in Mallorca. Later that month, they embarked on a UK tour that ran into October 2004. Following this, they went on a longer UK tour throughout November 2004. On 15 November 2004, a special edition of Out of Nothing was released, featuring a DVD with footage of their secret gigs from two months prior. This edition also included a special code that fans could use to enter into a competition for addition secret shows at the end of the year. The band promoted it two in-store signing sessions in Leeds, Birmingham and Liverpool. They closed out the year appearing at a benefit gig for Shelter, alongside Kasabian and the Zutons, and a secret show at the Carnglaze Caverns in Cornwall.Billboard reported in their 12 February 2005 issue that Embrace had signed to Lava Records for releases in the North American market. Between February and April 2005, Embrace went on another tour of the UK, played their first ever shows in the United States and then two gigs in Ireland. After this, Embrace went on a tour of the US with Snow Patrol in April and May 2005.

They were supported for the first show by the Ordinary Boys, the Subways, Hard-Fi and Anechoic, while other show feature Thirteen Senses, the Engineers and Infrasound. After initially planned for release in the US on 3 May 2005, Out of Nothing was eventually released there on 14 June 2005.

Our manager and good friend Steve Richards passed away, then Elektra folded so our label collapsed and then there were a lot of politics involved. It just got to the point where we didn't enjoy what we were doing anymore. There was no love for the music and no love for being on stage with one another, so it just seemed like we were constantly battling one another for different things.

Half of it is about my ex-fianc\u00e9 who meant everything to me, so once Motograter had fell apart and then her and I dwindled apart it just took a huge part of my life. So a lot of that song was about me losing that love and then having to say that it was over and move on. The other half was written about Motograter, because that was the closest thing I've ever had to a real family and it took a huge part of my soul.\"\nWhen Five Finger Death Punch performed a show in Arizona, the girl who Moody wrote \"The Bleeding\" about, his ex-fianc\u00e9, was at the show.

Moody spoke about it, saying: \"...when we performed in Arizona the girl who I wrote \"The Bleeding\" for was at the show and that the first time I had seen her in about a year and I almost broke into tears because it all came rushing back to me. I'm not one of those artists that just likes to get up on stage and drink beer, when I sing a song I like to take myself and the fans back to the place where I was when I wrote that song.\"\nWhen Moody spoke about the first time he heard \"The Bleeding\", he said: \"When I first heard it, I sat back in my chair and almost cried. I mean, it came so naturally. Cause at the time, you know, I had just separated from my ex-fiancee and with Motograter separating, it was a real tragic time. A good friend of mine had just passed.

The race cycle is divided into a number of legs, normally twelve; each episode generally covers the events of one leg. Each leg ends with a Pit Stop, where teams are given a chance to rest and recover before starting the next leg twelve hours later. The first team to arrive at a Pit Stop is often awarded a prize such as a trip, while the last team is normally eliminated from the race. Some legs are non-elimination legs, where the last team to arrive may be penalized in the following leg. Some races have featured double-length legs, where the teams meet the host at what appears to be a Pit Stop, only to be told to continue to race. The final leg of each race is run by the last three remaining teams, and the first to arrive at the final destination wins the show's prize, US$1 million. The average length of each race is approximately 21 to 30 days.\n\nDuring each leg, teams follow clues from Route Markers boxes containing clue envelopes marked in the race's red, yellow, and white colors to determine their next destination. Travel between destinations includes commercial and chartered airplanes, boats, trains, taxis, buses, and rented vehicles provided by the show, or the teams may simply travel by foot. Teams are required to pay for all expenses while traveling from a small stipend (on the order of $100) given to them at the start of each leg. Any money left unspent can be used in future legs of the race. The only exception is air travel, where teams are given a credit card to purchase economy-class fares. Some teams have resorted to begging to replenish their funds.Clues may directly identify locations, contain cryptic riddles such as \"Travel to the westernmost point in continental Europe\" that teams must figure out, or include physical elements, such as a country's flag, indicating their next destination. Clues may also describe a number of tasks that teams must complete before continuing to race. As such, teams are generally free and sometimes required to engage locals to help in any manner to decipher clues and complete tasks. Tasks are typically designed to highlight the local culture of the country they are in. Such tasks include:\n\nRoute Info: A general clue that may include a task to be completed by the team before they can receive their next clue.\nDetours: A choice of two tasks. Teams are free to choose either task or swap tasks if they find one option too difficult. There is generally one Detour present on each leg.\nRoadblocks: A task only one team member can complete. Teams must choose which member will complete the task based on a brief clue about the task before fully revealing the details of the task. Later editions of the program have limits on the number of Roadblocks one team member can perform and it is generally a requirement that both team members perform the same number of tasks. There is generally one Roadblock present on each leg.\nFast Forwards: A task that only one team may complete, allowing that team to skip all remaining tasks and head directly for the next Pit Stop. Teams may only claim one Fast Forward during the entire season. Last used in season 29.\nYields: A station where a team can force another trailing team to wait a predetermined amount of time before continuing the race. Teams may only yield any other team once per race. The Yield was initially used from season 5 through 11, afterwards being supplanted by the U-Turn. However, the Yield was reintroduced in Season 32.\nIntersections: Tasks that require two teams to work together until otherwise instructed. While Intersected, teams may be required to perform Detours, Roadblocks (a two-person task using one person from each team), and Fast Forwards together. First introduced in Season 10.\nU-Turns: A station, located after a Detour, where a team can force another trailing team to return and complete the other option of the Detour they did not select. Teams may only U-Turn any other team once per race. In season 29, U-Turn stations were moved before the Detour, and the limitation on the number of U-Turns a team could use was lifted. Season 31 introduced the U-Turn Vote where the teams voted for who they want to U-Turn. The two teams with the most votes were U-Turned. Season 35 was a private U-Turn vote - one team with the most votes was being U-Turned.\nSpeed Bumps: A task that only the team that came in last on the previous non-elimination leg must complete before continuing on the race, usually consisting of a small, easy to complete task. First introduced in Season 12.\nSwitchbacks: A task that is based on an iconic task performed on an earlier season of the Race, typically at the same location that was previously used. Examples have been a Roadblock that held a team back for several hours leading to their elimination and a Fast Forward that presented a difficult choice but the team who took it ultimately won the race. First introduced in Season 15.Teams are penalized for failing to complete these tasks as instructed or other rules of the race, generally thirty minutes plus any time gained for the infraction. Such penalties may be enforced while teams are racing, when they arrive at the Pit Stop, or at the start of the next leg.\nThe events of the race are generally edited and shown in chronological order, cutting between the actions of each team as they progress. More recent seasons have been edited to show split-screen footage of simultaneous actions or two or more different teams in the style of 24.

There is no doubt that Euripides transformed Caranus to Archelaus (meaning \"leader of the people\") in the play, in an attempt to please Archelaus I of Macedon.  In the play, Archelaus son of Temenus was exiled from Argos by his brothers and went to Thrace, to king Cisseus who happened to be at war with neighbouring people and promised Archelaus his kingdom and daughter if he could protect him against the enemies. Archelaus did it and went to ask the king for his promised reward. The king however broke his promise and decided to kill Archelaus by treachery. He therefore gave orders to prepare a pitfall to trap him. But a slave of the king told Archelaus about the plot and the hero asked for a secret interview with the king: when alone he threw him inside the pitfall.

The piece is structured in the style of a Ballad-opera, with songs and choruses, and also has music underlying dialogue, like a melodrama. Pocahontas persuades her father, King Powhatan, to free Smith and becomes attracted to John Rolfe, breaking off her arranged marriage with a neighboring tribal prince, an action that leads to war. Her tribe wins the war, but her father loses trust in the white settlers; Pocahontas warns the settlers who reconcile with Powhatan. Several comic romances end happily, and Smith predicts a great future for the new country.\nThe play deals with relations between Native Americans and the first European settlers in America. Scholars have debated whether the piece is progressive in its depiction of the natives and have commented that the work reflects an emerging American dramatic and musical sensibility. It served to popularize and romanticize the Pocahontas story as an important American myth.\nThe comedy was first performed in 1808 at The Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. It has been cited as the first play about American Indians by an American playwright known to be produced on a professional stage, and possibly the first play produced in America to be then performed in England, although the validity of both statements has been questioned. Its portrayal of Native Americans has been criticized as racially insensitive, but the piece is credited with inspiring a whole new genre of plays about Pocahontas specifically and Native Americans in general, that was prevalent throughout the 19th and early 20th Century.

While that project failed to materialise\u2014with More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies) being released in its place\u2014most of the unreleased songs were held over for a future project. \nIn February 1974, to give it an air of authority, Bill Wyman involved himself in compiling an album he entitled Black Box. However, Allen Klein wanted more Mick Jagger/Keith Richards songs in the project for monetary reasons, and Wyman's version remained unreleased. Metamorphosis was issued in its place.\nWyman's original picks for the record were as follows:\n\n\"Bright Lights Big City\"\n\"Cops and Robbers\"\n\"I'd Much Rather Be With the Boys\"\n\"Little Red Rooster\" (Live)\n\"Down the Road Apiece\" (Live)\n\"Don't Lie to Me\"\n\"If You Let Me\"\n\"Godzi\"\n\"Panama Powder Room\"\n\"Gold Painted Nails\"\n\"Fannie Mae\"\n\"Down in the Bottom\"\"Godzi\" and \"Panama Powder Room\" were instrumentals from the Between the Buttons sessions and have never been released. They were recorded at RCA Studios, Hollywood on August 4-12, 1966. \nMost tracks that appear on side one of the vinyl album are demos, written by Jagger and Richards for other artists to perform. Some were recorded with session musicians like Big Jim Sullivan on guitar, Clem Cattini on drums, and Jimmy Page on guitar, and were not intended for release by the Rolling Stones. Indeed, on most of these tracks the only Rolling Stone who appears is Jagger. \"Out of Time\" and \"Heart of Stone\" were well-known Stones songs that appear here in drastically different renditions, with session players providing the backing. Side two includes unreleased band recordings up until the Sticky Fingers sessions of 1970. \nWith some speculation that \"I'd Much Rather Be With the Boys\" had a homosexual subtext, The Toggery Five version changed the lyric to \"I'd rather be out with the boys.\" An alternate version of \"Memo from Turner\" includes Brian Jones on guitar and has a looser vibe than the Mick Jagger solo single from the soundtrack album of the 1970 film Performance. \nReleased in June 1975, Metamorphosis came out the same day as the band's authorised hits collection Made in the Shade and was also seen to be cashing in on the Rolling Stones' summer Tour of the Americas. While the critical reception was lukewarm, Metamorphosis still managed to reach No. 8 in the US, though it only made No. 45 in the UK.

The zombie women all pluck out one of their eyes, and Akko deceives the prince into believing that she is Cinderalla, although Cinderalla reveals Akko's deception with the help of Setsuko and the fairy, who now possesses all of her magical powers. Transformed into a zombie, Cinderalla marries the Prince. As Cinderalla concludes, Cinderalla has become successful with her giant fruits grown from yakitori sauce, and her husband does dinner shows at her father's remodeled restaurant. Now a celebrity, the fairy makes frequent television appearances, while Aki marries a reporter and Akko follows foreign idols. Cinderalla also buys a pancake-making machine for Caroline. Cinderalla also includes three short, related manga: \"How Caroline Became a Glutton\", which explores her backstory as a stripper; \"Papa's Professional Cooking\", which details a recipe for the fictitious sauce; and \"Of Course We All Know\", which focuses on the Prince's backstory in the form of lyrics.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Their classic lineup (1964\u20131978) consisted of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century. Their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large public address systems, the use of synthesisers, Entwistle's and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk, power pop and mod bands. The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.\nThe Who evolved from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"I Can't Explain\" (1965), reached the UK top ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including \"My Generation\" (1965), \"Substitute\" (1966) and \"Happy Jack\" (1966). In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released \"I Can See for Miles\", their only US top-ten single. The group's 1969 concept album Tommy included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success.\nFurther festival appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight, along with the concert album Live at Leeds (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up the album Who's Next (1971), including the hits \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", \"Baba O'Riley\", and \"Behind Blue Eyes\". The group released another concept album, Quadrophenia (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy (1975). They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You (1978) was overshadowed by Moon's death shortly after.\nKenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed touring, and released a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of the group, they split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th-anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996\u20131997. A full reunion began in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with Endless Wire.  Since Entwistle's death, the Who have continued to perform and tour, most commonly with Starkey on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, and Pete's brother Simon Townshend on second guitar and backing vocals. In 2019, the group released the album Who and toured with a symphony orchestra.", "hasanswer": false}]}

While most Biscaynes were sold with a six-cylinder engine through the late 1960s, the V8 engine became the more popular powerplant by the early 1970s. The Biscayne was usually built as a two- or four-door sedan, although a four-door station wagon was available between 1962 and 1968 (and again after 1973 in Canada only). A low-priced, full-size Biscayne station wagon equivalent was available as the Chevrolet Brookwood both before and after this period. The two-door sedan was dropped after 1969, and consequently, from 1970 to 1972 the only Biscayne model available was a four-door sedan. In 1958, the Delray was priced below the Biscayne but was discontinued the following year.\nMany of the luxury convenience options available on the more expensive full-sized Chevrolet models, such as power windows, were not available on the Biscayne. However, customers could purchase a Biscayne with any of Chevrolet's high-output big-block V8 engines and performance-oriented transmissions, including the floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission with Hurst shifter and low-ratio final drive. Original production numbers of cars built this way were very low, and examples of these high-performance cars are highly sought after by collectors today. Notably, Baldwin Chevrolet of Long Island, New York, became famous for offering the \"Street Racer Special,\" a 1968 Biscayne coupe with dealer-fitted high-performance 427 cubic-inch V8, and heavy-duty suspension components, turning the Biscayne into a serious drag car. Biscayne with high-performance equipment was often nicknamed \"Bisquick\" by enthusiasts.Like the slightly upscale Bel Airs, Biscaynes are easily identified by the use of two taillights per side; the only exceptions to this were in 1959 and 1972. The more expensive Impalas (and later Caprices) have three taillights per side. The Biscayne was largely devoid of exterior chrome trim and was normally fitted with small hubcaps, though several exterior trim pieces and upgraded wheel covers were available at extra cost. Interior trim was spartan, with lower-grade cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery trim, a standard steering wheel with centre horn button, and rubber floor mats. Slight upgrades were made throughout the life of the series \u2014 for instance, the 1964 models came standard with deluxe steering wheels with horn rings, deep-twist carpeting and foam-cushioned front seats.", "hasanswer": false}]}

During the 2000 leg of the tour, entitled Crazy 2k Tour, Spears changed the opening sequence of the show; the show started with a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of \"...Baby One More Time\". She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\", which included a chair dance sequence referencing Janet Jackson's \"Miss You Much\" music video that ended with Spears saying \"Is that the end?\", quoting Jackson's phrase from the video.

Tezuka's \"cinematic\" page layouts were influenced by Milt Gross' early graphic novel He Done Her Wrong. He read this book as a child, and its style characterized many manga artists who followed in Tezuka's footsteps.A key component of Tezuka's style is his extensive use of quotations, which include his allusions to popular works and adoptions of trends. For instance, he incorporated multiple varieties of depth into one frame\u2014mirroring a breakthrough technique in the realm of Hollywood film: deep-focus cinematography. Tezuka's Metropolis is an exemplar for his use of this technique, as well as for the cinematic \"pans and close-ups and zooms\" that created the illusion of motion in his scenes. Nonetheless: Tezuka's dyadic visual jokes\u2014which involve the arrival of creatures at emotionally-charged scenes\u2014disrupt the tension, reminding the reader of \"the framework of fiction\" and promoting a safe \"mode of identification\" with the narrative.Tezuka's quotations of real trends mark a key aspect of his style: adaptation in response to the socio-cultural situation and interests of his audience. He involved the \"kiss-scene\" motif due to its rising popularity in Japanese film. Tezuka juxtaposed this with elements more customary to Japan, such as the \"glorification of self-sacrifice\": instead of the usual happy ending, one or more of his characters would meet their demise but specifically for the sake of others. Aside from these borrowed motifs, a signature characteristic of Tezuka's style is the Star System, which refers to his casting of characters into different roles across a body of comics. His characters were modified to appear in different works, similar to how actors modify their personality and appearance to suit different performances. Influenced by film, he created bipartite characters that were constituted by the performer (or the stock character) and the performance (or the role played by the stock character). In doing so, Tezuka created space for intertextual history, references and commentary. The Star System utilized \"the crossover between celebrity, actor and character\" and also enabled Tezuka to involve intertextuality.Tezuka invented the distinctive \"large eyes\" style of Japanese animation, drawing inspiration from the eyes of the characters of the Takarazuka Revue, as well as from Western cartoon characters such as Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse, and Bambi, and from Disney movies.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Edward would never hit Caesar, but instead tell him off by shaking his walking stick at him while calling him a \"naughty dog\". Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst, reminisced about spending time with the dog whilst on the royal yacht, \"Whenever I went into the King's cabin, this dog always went for my trousers and worried them, much to the King's delight. I used not to take the slightest notice and went on talking all the time to the King which I think amused His Majesty still more.\" Caesar frequently caused problems for the King, escaping in Marienbad whilst chasing white peafowl and on another occasion killing rabbits owned by Lord Redesdale's daughters. The King even considered Caesar to be an obstacle to the Entente Cordiale. He asked his personal attendant, Lawrence Wrightson, to look after Caesar should he die before the dog.\nThe King ordered hardstone models of his favourite dogs and racehorses from the House of Faberg\u00e9. Caesar was at the King's side on the Norfolk estate when the initial wax models were revealed by the company. The model of Caesar was made of chalcedony, rubies, enamel and gold, and included Caesar's collar in the design.

At one point, he managed to sneak into the King's bedroom and was found hiding under his bed by Queen Alexandra. The Queen encouraged him to eat once more and restored him to his normal self. Caesar attended the funeral of Edward VII, and led the funeral procession alongside a highlander leading the King's horse, walking behind the carriage that carried the King's coffin.

During an interview about the album, when asked about its composition, the group said, \"You can expect a lot of realness, [and] we're trying to bring real R&B back to the world. Right now, R&B is not a genre anymore. It's pop, it's [hip-hop], it's other things. I wanna bring back rhythm and blues.\" In another interview, the girls talked about how different this album was from their shelved debut. \"Well it\u2019s very different coming out now because with this album we have more creative control. When we came out in 2003, we were young and we didn\u2019t have much of a say in what went down. But this time around, we were able to write every song on the album, which makes this album very personal for all of us.\" They later added, \"From this album you can expect realness. Expect to hear all of our individual voices. A lot of crunk tracks like our first single \u201cDo It To It\u201d. Also expect a lot of a cappella singing.\"The first track on the album, \"That Boi\", is an up tempo hip hop song that speaks of a boy who is driving the protagonist insane because she wants him so much. The song was intended to be released as a single. However, due to the merger of Capitol Records and Virgin Records, all single plans were canceled. \"Do It to It\" is the second song on the album, as well as the lead single. An uptempo dance track, the song was received positively by critics. It was also commercially successful, peaking inside the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The third song is \"Chevy\", and is yet another up tempo song with an R&B tint. The song speaks of the protagonist wanting to be \"treated like a Chevy\", stating \"you can show me off\". Some of the lyrics have been seen as sexual. The fourth song on the album is \"Unappreciated\", which was the second single. The R&B ballad had a somewhat successful commercial performance, peaking inside the top 40 in Japan, as well as peaking at 41 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their second to enter the chart. The fifth song is \"Taken\", an upbeat track that speaks of meeting someone at a club who treats them well and hooks up with them, even though they are taken. \"Stop Calling Me\" is the sixth track on the album, and is more slower paced than other tracks. It speaks of the protagonist who is trying to end the relationship, but her partner keeps calling, and will not give up on them.\n\"Oooh\" is the seventh song on the album, and is a more R&B tinted song. It speaks of the protagonist imagining all of the things she could do with her lover, but she is unsure if she is ready. The eighth song on the album is \"Chick Like Me\". The track features Rasheeda on guest vocals, and speaks about how boys want a \"chick like me\". \"Whenever\", the R&B ballad, is the ninth song on the album. It speaks of being there for a significant other when they need you the most. The tenth song on the album is \"Show & Tell\". The mid-tempo track was meant to be a future single, along with \"That Boi\". However, due to the merger between Capitol Records and Virgin Records, all future singles were canceled, leaving the track unreleased. \"Fool 4 You\" is a soft R&B track that speaks of the protagonist not being able to get over her past relationship. The last song on the album is the ballad \"Moment In Time\". It speaks of a couple who is on the verge of breaking up. The protagonist speaks of how she cannot go on without him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He explains that during the 1970s, he grew tired of the demands of his fame and switched places with an Elvis impersonator named Sebastian Haff; he claims it was Haff who died in 1977, while he lived in quiet, happy anonymity and made a living pretending to be himself. After a propane explosion destroyed documentation which was the only proof that he was actually Elvis, he was unable to return to his old life. He also falls into a coma after injuring himself during a performance.\nTwenty years later in the present, Elvis contemplates his age and dignity; his only friend is a man named Jack who insists he is President John F. Kennedy, claiming to have had his skin dyed black after an assassination attempt and abandoned by Lyndon Johnson in a nursing home. Initially skeptical of Jack's story, Elvis does spot a mysterious scar on the back of Jack's head, but is ultimately unsure of its origin.\nEventually, Elvis and Jack are forced to face off against a re-animated ancient Egyptian mummy that was stolen during a U.S. museum tour, and then lost during a severe storm in East Texas when the thieves' bus veered into a river near the nursing home. The mummy takes on the garb of a cowboy and feeds on the souls of the residents of the home. Jack surmises that it feeds at the nursing home because the residents are weak and that nobody will suspect that it\u2019s killing them off. It is dubbed \"Bubba Ho-Tep\" by Elvis, who has a telepathic flashback of the mummy's life and death when he looks into its eyes. Due to their age, Jack and Elvis lack mobility and use a motorized wheelchair and a walker to get around the grounds.\nElvis and Jack create an elaborate plan to destroy the mummy. Destruction of the mummy would release the trapped souls of the other inhabitants, and they would be able to go to their final resting place. Elvis and Jack battle the mummy in the middle of the night, with Jack in an electric wheelchair and Elvis wielding a makeshift flamethrower. Jack is knocked out of his wheelchair by the mummy and is about to have his soul devoured; Elvis commandeers the wheelchair and crashes into the mummy to save Jack, but damages the flamethrower and suffers a large gash in his abdomen in the process. Meanwhile, Jack dies from a heart attack. Elvis becomes committed to getting rid of the mummy and douses it with gasoline before throwing a match at it, incinerating the mummy.\nElvis lies on a hill near the riverbank, dying from the blood loss from the gash and broken ribs. He contemplates that he does not fear death, knowing he still has his soul and saved everyone at the Shady Rest Retirement Home. As he reflects upon this, the stars align into a message for Elvis, saying: \"all is well\". Elvis says, \"Thank you, thank you very much\", and dies.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At the beginning of the performance, the coaches have their backs turned to the participants, and if one of the coaches wants to take on a participant, they press their buttons and turn around to the singer who is automatically placed on his team. If more than one coach is turned around, the singer chooses the coach they want to work with. In the first four seasons and from the tenth, blind auditions end with the selection of 12 contestants. The size of the teams, however, varied over the seasons (13 in seasons 5 and 9; 14 in seasons 6 to 8; and 15 in season 14).\nFrom the eleventh season during blind auditions, each coach can \"block\" another. The coach against whom the block was used loses the chance to invite that participant to their team. Each coach can use this feature only twice. If a coach uses a \"block\" against another coach and  they do not turn around - the \"block\" is considered unused; this means that the block can be used as long as the coach who uses it actually \"blocks\" someone. \"Block\" buttons can be used both during and after a contestant's performance. In the fourteenth season, coaches will be able to use their block button only after a contestant's performance, unlike in the previous seasons.\nThe Battles round\nThis is followed by battles in which the coaches choose two people from their team (when the number of participants in a team is uneven, one of the battles is played by a trio, not a duo) who sing the same song together. The coach decides who moves on to the next stage and who drops out of the program. In the first season, coaches were assisted by invited specialists who were supposed to help them make the decision. From the second season onwards, the other coaches can make a \"steal\", i.e. take the loser to their team (by pressing their button). If more than one coach wants to steal a participant, that participant has the right to choose which team they want to go to. \nIn the seventh season, the \"stealing\" system has changed to what is known as the \"hot chairs\". Each coach can ultimately steal only one contestant (who sits on the hot seat assigned to that coach's team), because when \"stealing\" another contestant, the previously stolen person is replaced and dropped out of the competition; from the seventh to ninth seasons, each coach could steal (press the button and take over a contestant) up to three times, but from the tenth season, coaches can press the button to steal a contestant without any limitations. The battles therefore end with seven participants advancing to the next stage. During the ninth season, there was the first ever elimination of all participants from a team in one battle. \nIn season 14, battles have been divided into 2 parts: pre-battle and the main battle. During the pre-battle, the coaches pick three of their artists in a singing match and then select two of them to advance to the main battle to perform as a duo. During the main battle, the winning artists will battle once again, performing a different song. The coach select one of them to advance to the next round, while the other will be eliminated. At the end of this round, five artists will remain on each team. For the first time since the inaugural season, there are no steals during the battles round. \nThe Knockouts round\nThe battles are followed by the knockout round (in the first edition: overtime), in which the coaches eliminate more people who do not advance to the live episodes. During first six seasons, each of the coaches selected three people from his or her team (six people in the first season, seven people in the second season, eight people in seasons three to five, and nine people in the sixth season) who automatically qualified for the live shows. The coaches divided the others into threes (into two duos by the second season), and one person from each would move on to the next stage. Since the seventh season, all contestants have to sing - the first four from each team are automatically put in the hot seats, and after subsequent performances of the remaining three, the coach decides whether a given contestant stays in the show or not. Four (five in the first, second and sixth seasons) finalists from each team qualify for the live episodes. In the fourteenth season, five contestants will compete for the place in the live shows, but only four of them will advance to the next stage.\nThe Live Shows\nWhen the teams consist of five, four, or three contestants, the coach chooses from among the two contestants with the fewest votes from the viewers (who decide by sending text messages) the person who drops out of the show. Each live episode ends with the elimination of one person from each group. In eleventh season due to the coronavirus pandemic episodes were previously recorded and the elimination rules were changed. Once all participants from a given team sang their songs, the coaches scored the performances, awarding them from one to ten points. The coach of that team would then select one participant to move on to the next stage (regardless of the score). The participant with the lowest number of points was eliminated from the remaining three or two (in case of a tie, the points from the coach of the evaluated team were decisive).\nIn the semi-finals (when the team is made up of two people), the coach divides 100 points between the contestants and then everyone is credited with as many points as the percentage of votes they get from the viewers. In the fifth season, while the semi-final took the form of what is known in the international format as \"Cross Battles\", which involved contestants dueling between teams. In the semi-final of the eleventh season the deciding factor was the total number of points awarded by all the coaches.\nThe Final\nFour participants (one from each team, with the exception of the fifth season), and the winner is chosen by viewers in an SMS vote. Voting is divided into three rounds; after each round, the person with the fewest number of votes drops out. In the first round the finalists sing a foreign language song followed by a duet with their coach; in the second round the repertoire consists of Polish songs; in the third round the remaining two contestants sing their own songs. In the fourteenth season all contestants who will advance to the live shows will sing along with the finalists.", "hasanswer": false}]}

While living as a hitman for the American Mafia, he adheres to the code of the samurai, and interprets and applies the wisdom of the Hagakure.\nLouie tells Ghost Dog to kill a gangster, Handsome Frank, who is sleeping with the daughter of local mafia boss Vargo. Ghost Dog arrives and kills the gangster, before seeing that the girl is also in the room; he leaves her alive. To avoid being implicated in the murder of a made man, Vargo and his associate Sonny Valerio decide to get rid of Ghost Dog. Louie knows practically nothing about Ghost Dog, as the hitman communicates only by homing pigeon. The mobsters start by tracing all the pigeon coops in town. They find Ghost Dog's cabin atop a building and kill his pigeons. Ghost Dog realizes he must kill Vargo and his men or they will kill him and his master.\nDuring the day, Ghost Dog frequently visits the park to see his best friend, a French-speaking ice cream man named Raymond. Ghost Dog does not understand French and Raymond does not understand English but the two nonetheless seem to connect with each other. Ghost Dog also befriends a little girl named Pearline, to whom he lends the book Rash\u014dmon.\nEventually, Ghost Dog invades Vargo's mansion and kills almost everyone single-handedly, sparing only Louie and Vargo's daughter. That night, Ghost Dog kills Sonny Valerio at his home by shooting him through a pipe. Ghost Dog expects that Louie will attack him, as he feels that Louie is obliged to avenge the murder of his boss Vargo. He goes to the park and gives Raymond all his money, helping him to stay in the country. Pearline appears and gives back Rash\u014dmon to Ghost Dog, saying that she liked it. Ghost Dog gives Pearline his copy of Hagakure and encourages her to read it.\nThough Louie feels some loyalty to Ghost Dog, he finally confronts him at Raymond's ice cream stand with Raymond and Pearline watching. Ghost Dog is unwilling to attack his master and allows Louie to kill him. His last act is to give Louie the copy of Rash\u014dmon and encourage him to read it. Pearline takes Ghost Dog's empty gun and aims at Louie as he flees. Ghost Dog dies peacefully with Raymond and Pearline at his side; Louie gets into a car with Vargo's daughter (who now has replaced her father as his boss). Later, Pearline reads the Hagakure.", "hasanswer": false}]}
