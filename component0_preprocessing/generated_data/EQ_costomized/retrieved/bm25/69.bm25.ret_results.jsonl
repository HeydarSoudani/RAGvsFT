This was the genesis of quantum theory.\nAfter having attended realgymnasium  W\u00f6hlerschule in Frankfurt am Main, he started in 1884 to study electrical engineering at the technical universities in Darmstadt and Berlin. The following year he switched to physics at the University of Berlin which was more to his liking. After just one semester there he transferred to Strasbourg. There he benefited much from the lectures by August Kundt who in 1888 took over the vacant position of Hermann Helmholtz at the University of Berlin. Rubens followed after and got his doctors degree there the same year. In the period 1890\u20131896 he was employed as an assistant at the physics institute and made his habilitation in 1892. He was then a privatdozent and was allowed to teach. Already then he was praised for his experimental investigations of infrared radiation.\nRubens got a permanent position in 1896 as docent at the Technical University of Berlin in Berlin-Charlottenburg. He could continue his experimental research at the nearby Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt. It was there he in 1900 did his important measurements of black-body radiation which made him world-famous. He was promoted to professor the same year.\nAfter Paul Drude retired in 1906 from his professorship at the University in Berlin, the position was given to Rubens. He was at the same time appointed director of the physics institute. In this way he could influence and lead a large group of colleagues and students. The year after he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences and became in 1908 a corresponding member G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities.

At a memorial meeting in the science academy the following year Max Planck said about him:\nWithout the intervention of Rubens the formulation of the radiation law and thereby the foundation of quantum theory would perhaps have arisen in quite a different manner, or perhaps not have developed in Germany at all.\nHe is buried at the Alter St.-Matth\u00e4us-Kirchhof in Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg with his wife Marie.

Her brother was the mathematician Arthur Black, and her sister was the labour organiser and novelist Clementina Black. Her father became paralysed in 1873, and two years later her mother died from a heart attack after lifting him from his chair to his bed.She was initially educated at Brighton and Hove High School. Afterwards she studied Latin and Greek at Newnham College, Cambridge, on a government scholarship. In 1883 she moved to London, where she started work as a governess, and then as the librarian at the People's Palace Library. Through her sister, Clementina, she met Dr. Richard Garnett, then the Keeper of Printed Materials at the British Museum, and his son Edward Garnett, whom she married in Brighton on 31 August 1889. Edward, after working as a publisher's reader for T. Fisher Unwin, William Heinemann, and Duckworth, went on to become a reader for the publisher Jonathan Cape. In the summer of 1891, then pregnant with her only child, she was introduced by Edward to the Russian exile Feliks Volkhovsky, who began teaching her Russian. He also introduced her to his fellow exile and colleague Sergius Stepniak and his wife Fanny. Soon after, Garnett began working with Stepniak, translating Russian works for publication; her first published translations were A Common Story by Ivan Goncharov, and The Kingdom of God is Within You by Leo Tolstoy. The latter was published while she was making her first trip to Russia in early 1894.  After visits to Moscow and Saint Petersburg, she travelled to Yasnaya Polyana where she met Tolstoy; although the latter expressed interest in having her translate more of his religious works, she had already begun working on the novels of Turgenev and continued with that on her return home.  Initially she worked with Stepniak on her translations; after his untimely death in 1895, Stepniak's wife Fanny worked with her. From 1906, her favourite amanuensis was a young Russian woman, Natalie Duddington whom she had met in Russia and in whom she found \"real intellectual companionship\".Over the next four decades, Garnett produced English-language versions of dozens of volumes by Tolstoy, Gogol, Goncharov, Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, Ostrovsky, Herzen and Chekhov.\nHer son and only child, David Garnett, trained as a biologist and later wrote novels, including the popular Lady into Fox (1922).\nBy the late 1920s, Garnett was frail and half-blind.

In 2011 McBride was still in college, and was elected student body president at American University. During her last week as student body president in 2012, McBride gained international attention when she came out as a transgender woman in her college's student newspaper, The Eagle.\nMcBride's coming out was featured on NPR, The Huffington Post, and by Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation. After coming out, McBride received a call from Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, saying, \"Sarah, I just wanted you to know, I'm so proud of you. I love you, and you're still a part of the Biden family.\" Vice President Joe Biden expressed similar sentiments, sharing that he was proud of her and happy for her. In 2012, McBride interned at the White House, becoming the first openly transgender woman to work there in any capacity. McBride worked in the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, where she worked on LGBT issues. In a speech in May 2015, Second Lady Jill Biden told McBride's story. She added, \"we believe young people should be valued for who they are, no matter what they look like, where they're from, the gender with which they identify, or who they love.\"In January 2013, McBride joined the board of directors of Equality Delaware and quickly became the state's leading advocate for legal protections and hate crimes legislation for transgender Delawareans. McBride and her family led the lobbying effort for legislation protecting Delawareans from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression in employment, housing, insurance, and public accommodations. In addition to serving as the primary spokesperson for the legislation, McBride built on her close relationship with Governor Jack Markell and Attorney General Beau Biden to gain the vocal support of both officials behind the bill. The legislation passed the state senate by a margin of one vote and the state house by a vote of 24\u201317. An amended bill was re-passed by the state senate and immediately signed into law by Markell in June 2013.\nUpon signing the legislation, Markell stated:I especially want to thank my friend Sarah McBride, an intelligent and talented Delawarean who happens to be transgender. She courageously stood before the General Assembly to describe her personal struggles with gender identity and communicate her desire to return home after her college graduation without fear. Her tireless advocacy for passage of this legislation has made a real difference for all transgender people in Delaware.\nAfter passage of this  legislation, McBride worked on the LGBT Progress team at the Center for American Progress. McBride has spoken at a number of colleges and LGBT events, including the Human Rights Campaign National Dinner, the Human Rights Campaign Los Angeles Dinner, the Victory Fund National Brunch, the University of Pennsylvania, and Gettysburg College. McBride was ranked the Most Valuable Progressive in Delaware by DelawareLiberal.net listed in the 2014 list of the Trans 100, and named one of the fifty upcoming millennials poised to make a difference in the coming years by MIC.com. A 2015 article in the New Statesman on transgender representation in elective office predicted McBride would be the first transgender American elected to high public office. McBride was a panelist at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's \"GLOBE Pride 2016\" on youth and workplace bullying. McBride has been featured in The New York Times, The Huffington Post, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, Al Jazeera, PBS NewsHour, Teen Vogue, North Carolina Public Radio, The New Yorker, MSNBC, ThinkProgress, BuzzFeed, and NPR.\nIn April 2016, McBride delivered a TED Talk titled, \"Gender assigned to us at birth should not dictate who we are.\" She also served on the steering committee of Trans United for Hillary, an effort to educate and mobilize transgender people and their allies in support of Hillary Clinton.On July 28, 2016, McBride became the first openly transgender person to speak at a national party convention when she spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

No note was left.Dhan Gopal Mukerji is probably the first popular Indian writer in English. He pre-dates G.V. Desani and Mulk Raj Anand by some ten or twenty years. Krupabai Satthianadhan, the woman who wrote the novels Kamala and Saguna in the late nineteenth century, was certainly an accomplished writer, but her works did not reach a mass audience until she was rediscovered in the twentieth century. Scattered writings in English by Indians are encountered throughout the nineteenth century, such as the famous Rajmohan's Wife, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's first novel, written in English after the manner of Scott. There was also notable work by figures such as Roquia Sakhawat Hussain, writer of Sultana's Dream (1905), the first science fiction piece in English by an Indian, comparable to Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland. But usually these are byproducts of Indian language work, and Dhan Gopal Mukerji is the first to write seriously and consistently in English.\nThis was not by choice, but was a product of his unfortunate situation. Dhan Gopal never lost the sense of mission which he shared with his brother, and throughout his life strove to complete the task he had set himself: to emancipate India from foreign rule and win for her culture and philosophy the respect he felt it deserved. In America he associated with fellow exiles like M.N. Roy, the founder of the Communist Party of India, to whom he is said to have suggested the adoption of the pseudonym 'Manabendra'.\nForbidden the more satisfying outlet of activism, he poured his feelings into his writing. Consequently, his language is magical and persuasive, and his observation of animals and their ways is accurate and unsentimental. In his work the Gond hunter and the Brahmin child are equals in their travels in the jungle, and Dhan Gopal Mukerji never (unlike Kipling) anthropomorphises the animals or draws a facile moral from them. Although he was acutely conscious of his high caste, he saw it more as a responsibility than a privilege, and neither patronised nor denigrated the so-called lower castes and communities. He was, however, less sound on the subject of women. He writes movingly of child prostitutes in America in the 1910s and 1920s, especially of their plight during the Great Depression, but he also romanticises the life of Rangini, a 'tawaif' (courtesan) encountered in Caste and Outcast. He also praises his mother's and sisters' strict asceticism, all the more so since his mother is at that time a widow, performing all the hard penances prescribed to Hindu widows of her caste.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He and his twin brother, Robert H. Hume, became famous in 1944 and 1945 as the \u201cdead heat twins\u201d due to their practice of finishing their races hand-in-hand in an intentional effort to finish each race tied for the win.  During the 1944 track season, the Hume twins tied for the win in nine straight mile races, including the Big Ten Conference and NCAA championships.  They were co-winners in every mile event they entered in 1944 except one.  The exception occurred at a dual meet in which \"a meticulous official ruled that one of the Humes beat the other across the finish line by a couple of inches although they were hand in hand at the wire.\"  Their best time in a \u201cdead heat\u201d mile with hands clasped was 4:14.6 at the Central Collegiate Conference meet in 1944; the time broke a school record of 4:16.4 that had been set by H.L. Carroll 28 years earlier in 1916.The Hume twins were raised in Canonsburg, a small town in Pennsylvania\u2019s soft coal region, not far from Pittsburgh.  Robert Hume set the school record for the mile, and Ross set the record in the half mile.   After graduating from Canonsburg High School, the Hume twins enrolled at the University of Michigan to run track under Coach Ken Doherty.  One sports columnist in 1945 noted that the Humes were \u201ctwins in every possible manner, facial resemblance, running style, the clothes they wear, and the courses they are taking.\u201dIn his track career at Michigan, Ross Hume won three NCAA championships and six Big Ten Conference championships.  He won the 1944 NCAA outdoor mile run in a dead heat with his brother.  And in 1945, he won NCAA individual championships in both the outdoor mile run and the outdoor 880-yard run.  He won six Big Ten championships from 1943-1946.  His  Big Ten championships included the indoor and outdoor mile runs in 1944 and 1945, all four of which were shared \u201cdead heat\u201d wins with his brother.  He also won Big Ten championships in the two-mile run in the 1944 outdoor and 1945 indoor conference championship meets.   Ross was named an NCAA All-American three times and was selected as the captain of Michigan\u2019s track team in 1945.\n\nThe Hume twins\u2019 practice of interlocking hands in \u201cdead heat\u201d wins drew national publicity and also controversy.  Associated Press columnist Jimmy Jordan dubbed them the \u201cdead heat twins.\u201d  Another writer referred to them as the \u201cDead Heat Kids.\u201d  The publicity peaked in June 1944 when \u201cMichigan's famous distance running twins raced to their ninth straight dead-heat victory in the mile run of the 23rd National Collegiate Athletic Association track and field championship meet tonight, finishing hand-in-hand more than 100 yards ahead of the next runner.\u201d  A columnist in Massachusetts wrote: \u201dAs the twins finished their sophomore year at Michigan, [Coach Ken] Doherty decided to run them in the mile and two mile races together \u2026 this proved to be a happy solution \u2026 the twins like to run together .. they\u2019ve been doing that since before their school days .. furthermore, they usually finish so far in front that the last 50 yards finds that they are clasping hands and hit the tape together.\u201d\nUnited Press columnist Bob Meyer noted that they \u201cdeliberately have finished in a dead heat for first place in every mile except one in which both were entered this year,\u201d and suggested that the twins \u201cpossibly may forget their sentimental trick of locking hands for a dead-heat finish in order to defeat a tough field and slice another second or 2 off their CCC time.\u201dAs a result of the Humes\u2019 practice, the NCAA passed a rule in 1946 stating that athletes would no longer be able to tie in any track meets.After graduating from Michigan, Ross Hume became an orthopedic surgeon.  His brother Robert became a general surgeon.  The brothers were inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1990.

In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father, thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628, he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. \nDespite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas.\nHale sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676.\nHale's published works were particularly influential in the development of English common law. His Historia Placitorum Coron\u00e6, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \"of the highest authority\", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \"appeal to reason\" and John Selden's \"appeal to contract\", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. Hale wrote that a man could not be charged with marital rape, and that view was widely held until the 1990s. However, he eliminated the previous rape defence that existed in English law for an unmarried man cohabiting with a woman.\nModern scholars also offer criticism of Hale for his execution of at least two women for witchcraft in the Bury St Edmunds witch trials and his belief that capital punishment should extend to those as young as fourteen.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He attended the University of North Carolina from which he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude in 1947. After a year working in Indiana, Florida and New York City, he went to Harvard University where he received an MA in English Literature.\nIn 1949, he taught as a Fulbright Scholar in Versailles, France. From 1950 to 1951 he was an assistant professor and taught at Heidelberg University. From 1952 to 1954, he was a member of the Iowa Writer's Workshop and received a PhD from the University of Iowa in 1954. After a year teaching at Connecticut College in New London, he came to the University of Chicago where he taught from 1955 to 2002. He retired as Helen A Regenstein Professor of English and American Literature in 2004.\nDuring his tenure at the University of Chicago, Stern was allegedly involved in the \"suppression\" of the \"beat edition\" of the Chicago Review (winter edition of 1958). At the time the Chicago Review was a student/faculty literary publication published by the University of Chicago. The editor then was Irving Rosenthal. The \"beat edition\" of the Review was to include excerpts from Naked Lunch, by William S. Burroughs, and a few Jack Kerouac stories. According to Rosenthal, Stern, along with Joshua Taylor, another faculty member, wanted to suppress the winter issue, being himself \"so quick to protect the administration.\" (For reference to the case of censorship See The Beats, A Literary Reference, by Matt Theado, pp. 103, 104, 105, under the chapter titled \"The Chicago Review and a Case of Censorship.\")\nStern's own account of the \"so-called suppression\" appeared in \"How I Think I Got to Think the Way I Think\" in The Republic of Letters (reprinted in Still on Call, Stern's  \"orderly miscellany\"). It recounts Stern's successful attempt not only to save the review (the University President at the time, Lawrence A. Kimpton, wished to stop funding the journal) but to keep the following issue from dropping any of the pieces (of Naked Lunch and other \"beat\" works) that had been accepted. Rosenthal and Paul Carroll, the Review's co- editors, founded Big Table, using submissions which Stern and the other student editors claimed belonged to the Review. (Oddly, Stern was invited to and did read at a fund-raiser for Big Table and published what he read in its second issue.)  Furthermore, the previous issue of the Review included an excerpt from Naked Lunch along with work by other Beats.\nIn 1960, Stern published his first novel, Golk,  then the novels Europe or Up and Down with Baggish and Schreiber (1961), In Any Case (1962), Stitch (1965), Other Men's Daughters (1973), Natural Shocks (1978), A Father's Words (1986), and Pacific Tremors (2001). There also have been short story collections culminating in his collected stories, Almonds to Zhoof published in 2004, his 21st book. Of this last book, a reviewer in the New Republic called Stern \"the best American author of whom you have never heard.\" This indeed has been the tag associated with Mr. Stern for the last quarter of a century. \"I was a has-been before I'd been a been,\" was a well-known self-deprecation as was the word of Richard Schickel that Mr. Stern \"was almost famous for not being famous\". Stern published another collection of essays, What is What Was, in 2002.  Like his other essay collections, this one demonstrates that his astute observations in fiction are equal to, and derived from, his acute views on news and culture.\nIn 1985, Stern received the Medal of Merit for the Novel, awarded to a novelist every six years by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Among his many other awards was the Heartland Award for the best work of non-fiction which Stern received for his memoir, Sistermony, published in 1995. Stern has been praised by many of the great writers and critics of the last fifty years, among them Anthony Burgess, Flannery O'Connor, Howard Nemerov, Thomas Berger, Hugh Kenner, Sven Birkerts, and Richard Ellmann, as well as his close friends Tom Rogers, Saul Bellow, Donald Justice, and Philip Roth (see Stern's essay \"Glimpse, Encounter, Acquaintance, Friendship\" in Sewanee Review, Winter 2009).  He also enjoyed literary acquaintances and friendships with such figures as Samuel Beckett, Ezra Pound, Robert Lowell, Lillian Hellman, and Jorge Luis Borges.  Some of Stern's students at the University of Chicago went on to become distinguished writers themselves such as Douglas Unger, Robert Coover, Austin Wright, Campbell McGrath, Peter LaSalle, and Alane Rollings, as well as the well-known journalists Seymour Hersh, David Brooks and Mike Taibbi.\nAt 80, Stern continued to write, and his books remain in print through Northwestern University Press and University of Chicago Press.

{"id": "69_174", "question": "Where was Eugene Talmadge educated?", "ctxs": [{"id": "69_3219", "text": "Talmadge was elected again as governor in 1940 and returned to the governor's office in 1941, emerging as the leader of racist and segregationist elements in Georgia.  Responding to reports that Walter Cocking, a dean at the University of Georgia, had advocated bringing black and white students together in the classroom, Talmadge launched an attack on the university, charging elitism, and called for the regents to remove Cocking and purge the university of communists, \"foreigners\" (non-Georgians), and subscribers to racial equality. The university board of regents at first refused Talmadge's demands, but after the governor restructured the board, the university dismissed numerous staff.\nThis intervention into academic affairs caused the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to remove accreditation from the Georgia state universities. It also contributed to Talmadge's defeat by Ellis Arnall in 1942.In 1940\u20131941, Talmadge took a strongly isolationist line and was opposed to Roosevelt's policy of having America be the \"arsenal of democracy\". He said that money spent in aiding Britain, China and the Soviet Union would have been better spent on helping the poor farmers of Georgia. The fact that Talmadge had an admiration for Hitler and voiced such strong support for Japan's war against China that the Japanese government invited him to visit Japan on all-expenses paid vacation (an offer he declined) led to allegations that he was an Axis-sympathizer. Some commentators felt that Talmadge was merely naive, a man who knew nothing about the affairs of Europe and Asia, while others charged that his authoritarian style of leadership made him naturally sympathetic towards fascist regimes. About the charge that he acted like a dictator, Talmadge replied: \"I'm what you call a minor dictator. But did you ever see anybody that was much good who didn't have a little dictator in him?\" Talmadge's biographer, William Anderson, wrote that Talmadge's admiration for Nazi Germany, his tendency to surround himself with paramilitary followers, and his frequent calls for martial law gave \"an eerie backing\" for his words.At the same time, the Cocking Affair had badly damaged Talmadge's reputation. Arnall was a supporter of segregation, whose views on race were essentially the same as Talmadge's, but he presented himself as a supporter of better education for Georgians. Arnall noted that nobody could beat Talmadge in what he cynically called the \"nigger-hating contest\", and argued that the issue in the \"Cocking Affair\" was not white supremacy, as Talmadge claimed, but education. Arnall charged that Georgia's universities losing their accreditation, which Talmadge presented as an achievement on his part, put at risk the futures of all the students attending the universities. At a time when most Georgians were living in poverty and few attended higher education, the possibility that those young people who were lucky enough to attend university or might be would lose their chances to escape lives of poverty was widely regarded as unacceptable. Those Georgians whose children were attending the university were outraged that the futures of their children had been at risk, and those whose children were not attending university had hopes that someday they might.The students at Georgia's universities and colleges campaigned vigorously against Talmadge, putting on skits that mocked the governor as a power-crazed buffoon just before football games. They were disproportionately over-represented as volunteers in the Arnall campaign. When Talmadge held campaign rallies, students showed up to chant \"To Hell with Talmadge!\" At one Talmadge campaign rally on July 2, 1942, a Talmadge supporter threw a canister of tear gas at the students, an incident that attracted much negative comment and led to demands that Talmadge discipline his \"hoodlums\" who always patrolled his rallies. Talmadge was so unpopular with students that his campaign workers in the university town of Athens urged him not to hold a campaign rally there, predicting that more people would come out to boo him than cheer him.Realizing that Arnall had cast himself as stronger on the education issue, Talmadge changed tactics and announced simply that the loss of accreditation to Georgia's universities did not matter, saying at one rally in a rural area: \"They talk about education. It ain't never taught a man how to plant cotton. It ain't made a garden bloom. It ain't never taught the experience necessary to raise cows and chickens. You gotta git out and do them things, and no school education is going to help ya\". This message was intended to appeal to the white farmers who traditionally supported Talmadge, but may have inadvertently hurt him as even many of Talmadge's rural supporters knew that a better education represented their children's best hope of escaping poverty, and did not appreciate the implied message that the best thing that could happen to their children would be to follow their parents in lives of drudgery and poverty.\nAs was always the case, Talmadge presented himself as an aggressive defender of white supremacy, arguing that keeping the black people disfranchised and segregated was far more important than education, a message that appealed to his core supporters, but to nobody else. At one campaign rally, Talmadge stated: \"We in the South love the Negro in his place-but his place is at the back door\". The fact that Arnall had also declared himself a supporter of segregation, albeit not in quite the same crude terms as Talmadge had, meant that for many white Georgians there was no difference between the candidates on \"the Negro question\", and therefore neutralized Talmadge's advantage as an defender of white supremacy. Furthermore, men were more likely to vote for Talmadge than women, and in 1942, many Georgian men were serving in the military, thus leading to women being over-represented in the Democratic primary. In the primary, Arnall won 174,575 votes to Talmadge's 128,394. Even the \"county unit system\", which worked to Talmadge's advantage in the past, failed to save him in 1942. Arnall won 242 unit votes to Talmadge's 149.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She was assisted by experts at the University of Washington, the National Research Council Rehabilitation Technology Unit and the Microcomputer Application Program at the Hugh MacMillan Centre.\nThis project began while Treviranus was under contract as a tutor at McMaster University in the Faculty of Health Sciences to integrate 12 students with disabilities into McMaster in compliance with Bill 82, the Ontario Education Act by the Education Amendment Act, 1980, which states that \"the responsibility of school boards to provide (or to agree with another board to provide) in accordance with the regulations, special education programs and special education services for their exceptional pupils\". The McMaster experience \"was a pivotal moment for Treviranus and inspired her work with people with disabilities (PWDs) and in the field of Inclusive Design\".In 1994, Treviranus founded the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC) at the University of Toronto. Her first major research project was in collaboration with SoftQuad and Yuri Rubinsky, funded by Canarie. The goal of the project was to embed accessibility support, in the form of an on-screen \"visual dynamic keyboard\" that offered various text-entry methods, into HoTMeTaL, an early HTML editor. This in part, with Mike Paciello's help, led to the formation of the Web Accessibility Initiative of the W3C.Treviranus moved the ATRC to OCAD University in 2010 and rebranded it as the IDRC. \"She has played a leading role in developing accessibility legislation, standards and specifications internationally (including WAI ATAG, IMS AccessForAll, ISO 24751, and AODA Information and Communication)\".In 2000, Treviranus was a chief expert witness in Maguire v SOCOG 2000, an Australian human rights case regarding the inaccessibility of the Sydney Olympics.  Bruce Maguire won the case leading to changes in accessibility requirements at international games. As a result of this case, the Australian government made the decision to require its agencies to employ W3C guidelines.In 2007, Treviranus was an expert witness in the Donna Jodhan Canadian Supreme Court case whose verdict compelled the Canadian Government to make all of its websites accessible.As the founder of the IDRC and the IDI, one of the areas that Treviranus focuses her efforts on is making the internet accessible through research on assistive tools such as screen readers, touch pads and joysticks.  Treviranus\u2019s research has been used by the Government of Ontario Diversity Office as well as by the United Nations to create disability policy such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Her work is the focal point of a feasibility study by the United States Department of Education on accessibility.As a university professor, she established a new Master of Design in Inclusive Design (MDes INCD) programme at OCAD University in 2010.  The MDes INCD programme teaches the fundamentals of Inclusive Design.  \"Part of the reason I came to OCADU was because there was the opportunity to start a new graduate program.\" What is unique about the MDes INCD programme is that the students in the programme are selected for their diversity \u2013 from a very wide range of interests and expertise.In 2012 Treviranus cofounded the annual Designing Enabling Economies and Policies (DEEP) Conference to \"engage in substantive in-depth discussion about implementation strategies for digital inclusion of persons with disabilities among decision makers promoting the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in their respective countries; To identify levers and innovative approaches that go beyond current strategies.\"Treviranus is the lead project editor of the ISO 24751 standard, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 36, which supports automatic matching of user accessibility needs with digital resources and user interface configurations.

He traveled with John Franklin in search of the Northwest Passage on the Coppermine Expedition of 1819\u20131822. Richardson wrote the sections on geology, botany and ichthyology for the official account of the expedition.Franklin and Richardson returned to Canada in 1825 and went overland by fur trade routes to the mouth of the Mackenzie River. Franklin was to go as far west as possible and Richardson was to go east to the mouth of the Coppermine River.  These were the only known points on the central coast and had been reached in 1793 and 1771 respectively. He had with him two specially-built boats which were more ocean-worthy than the voyageur canoes used by Franklin on his previous expedition. They gave their names to the Dolphin and Union Strait near the end of his route.\nHis journey was successful and he reached his furthest east the same day that Franklin reached his furthest west (16 August 1826). He abandoned his boats at Bloody Falls and trekked overland to Fort Franklin which he reached three weeks before Franklin. Together they had surveyed 1,878 mi (3,022 km) of previously unmapped coast.

As a result of Prussia's losses in the Fourth Coalition War of the Napoleonic Wars at the battle of Jena-Auerstedt, he went with Hardenberg in 1806 to Tilsit to work on the Prussian Reforms.\nPlans for insurrection against the French occupation stalled the state minister Karl Freiherr vom Stein's reform plans. In 1808, Altenstein became his successor as the head of administration of Finance. He could not prevail against the forces set in motion by his predecessor to introduce reform so he continued them with the same energy. In 1810, Prussia could no longer afford the reparations agreed to in the Peace of Tilsit. Altenstein suggested the cessation of Silesia to France and so was dismissed in June by King Frederick William III at the instigation of Hardenberg.\nAfter his release, he went to Breslau where he was appointed civil governor of Silesia in 1813. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, he, together with Wilhelm von Humboldt in Paris, reclaimed treasures that had been confiscated by Napoleon.In 1817, he took over as head of the newly formed Ministry of Culture, again answering to Hardenberg, now State Chancellor. He was charged with the political responsibility of refounding the Evangelical Church in Prussia. In the next 20 years he reformed the Prussian schools, radically changing education. He is credited with the first \"humanistic\" school of education and the University of Bonn in 1818. With the Education Act of 1819, he developed a master plan for the system that still persists today: a multi-unit school system with a differentiation between primary and secondary education.

Subsequently, his son Robert M. La Follette Jr. was elected to the seat.After her husband's death, Belle Case remained an influential figure and editor. By the mid-1930s, the La Follettes had reformed the Progressive Party on the state level in the form of the Wisconsin Progressive Party. The party quickly, if briefly, became the dominant political power in the state, electing seven Progressive congressmen in 1934 and 1936. Their younger son, Philip La Follette, was elected Governor of Wisconsin, while their older son, Robert M. La Follette Jr., succeeded his father as senator. La Follette's daughter, Fola La Follette, was a prominent suffragette and labor activist and was married to the playwright George Middleton. A grandson, Bronson La Follette, served several terms as the Attorney General of Wisconsin and was the 1968 Democratic gubernatorial nominee. La Follette has also influenced numerous other progressive politicians outside of Wisconsin, including Floyd B. Olson, Upton Sinclair, Fiorello La Guardia, and Wayne Morse. Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has frequently been compared to La Follette.In 1957, a Senate Committee chaired by Senator John F. Kennedy selected La Follette to be one of the five senators to be listed in the Senate \"Hall of Fame\", along with Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, and Robert A. Taft. A 1982 survey asking historians to rank the \"ten greatest Senators in the nation's history\" based on \"accomplishments in office\" and \"long range impact on American history\", placed La Follette first, tied with Henry Clay. Writing in 1998, historian John D. Buenker described La Follette as \"the most celebrated figure in Wisconsin history\". La Follette is represented by one of two statues from Wisconsin in the National Statuary Hall. An oval portrait of La Follette, painted by his cousin, Chester La Follette, also hangs in the Senate.

He became a corporate lawyer with Sullivan & Cromwell, but found work at the large firm stifling, and left for a smaller practice. He resided in Brooklyn, where he was a trustee of the public library and of the Long Island College of Medicine.In 1938 he was appointed by New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia to the Board of Higher Education, replacing Arthur M.

By the following year, he was chairman of the conduct committee for the Board, and was elected chairman of the administrative committee of Brooklyn College. His Board of Higher Education duties included leading the investigation for the Rapp-Coudert Committee into the extent of communist influence within the public schools.He resigned his Board of Higher Education position in 1942 to enter the Army as a major. Later that year, he was assigned by the U.S. War Department to be a defense lawyer for eight Nazi saboteurs involved in Operation Pastorius. President Roosevelt had directed that the saboteurs be tried via a military tribunal; Lauson's designated role for the defense was to research whether this was constitutionally permissible. Lauson believed there was a strong possibility that a military trial was unconstitutional, and therefore the defense sought a Supreme Court order declaring as much. With the matter set to come before the Supreme Court as Ex parte Quirin, there was a question as to whether Lauson's father, Chief Justice Harlan Stone, would recuse himself from the case due to his son's involvement with the defense. Harlan did offer to do so, but his recusal was declined by Attorney General Francis Biddle, ostensibly because Lauson's involvement had been limited to the military tribunal, and he had been excused from the matters that were coming before the Supreme Court. Legal scholars have questioned this distinction, citing it as one example among many potential conflicts of interest produced by the case's unique circumstances.In 1944, at age 41, Lauson was promoted to the rank of colonel, and he was later discharged at that rank, after being awarded the Legion of Merit Medal.

Dowding is best known for his work on \"power\", applying insights from formal analysis to central debates on the nature of power and structure of power in society. Expanding on Brian Barry's concept of \"luck\" (getting what you want without trying) he argues that some groups of people are \"systematically lucky\" in that they are advantaged because of the way society is structured. Such people are not powerful in the sense they have resources that they could use that other groups do not (though they might have this power as well) but rather systematically lucky in that they tend to get what they want without having to do anything. Alternatively, other groups are systematically unlucky. This argument has caused great controversy with critics including Brian Barry, Steven Lukes, Peter Morriss and more recently Andrew Hindmoor.Dowding has also worked on the Tiebout model of individuals moving location to get the local services they require, showing that such moving does occur in the UK though only to a small extent, and that people tend to move to areas for service reasons, but do not decide to leave from areas for those reasons. He has extended this work into examining Albert Hirschman's Exit, Voice and Loyalty Model and has a forthcoming Cambridge University Press book Exits, Voices and Social Investment co-authored with long-time collaborator Peter John extending and applying Hirschman's model to citizen satisfaction with government services.\nDowding also considered the theory of presidentialisation of British politics in his 2012 article, \u201cThe Prime Ministerialization of the British Prime Minister\u201d.

Eastward from here there is about a 0.03 degree upward slope before reaching the outflow channels, which means that if you filled the canyon with fluid, it would create a lake with a depth of 1 km (3,300 ft) before the fluid would overflow out onto the northern plains.Keith Harrison and Mary Chapman described strong evidence for a lake in the eastern part of Valles Marineris, especially in Coprates Chasma. It would have had an average depth of only 842 m\u2014much smaller than the 5\u201310 km depth of parts of Valles Marineris. Still, its volume of 110,000 cubic miles would be comparable to Earth\u2019s Caspian and Black Seas.

He is perhaps best known for dealing with the elusive concepts of memory and perception through light installations. After measuring with a colorimeter the light that exist naturally in a specific place and time, Finch re-constructs the luminosity of the location through artificial means. For example, Moonlight (Luna County, New Mexico, July 13, 2003), replicates the exact light of the full moon that shone over the desert of Luna County, New Mexico on the evening of July 13, 2003.Creative Time, Friends of the High Line, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation commissioned The River That Flows Both Ways to Spencer Finch as the inaugural art installation for the High Line Park.

This society was organized to establish a Baptist school in the region, which began as Oregon City College in 1849. In 1855, Sebastian C. Adams began to agitate for a school in McMinnville. Adams and his associates were members of the Christian Church, and so the school became a Christian School. To begin, 6 acres (2.4 ha) of property were donated by W. T. Newby and a group was formed to establish the school. The group included William Dawson, James McBride,  Newby, and Adams, and they bore the major part of the expenses of starting the school. These men built a building and convinced Adams, who was a teacher, to operate the school.  After about a year and a half and because of the difficulty of running the school alone and funding problems, Adams suggested that the school be turned over to the Baptists who were attempting to start up the West Union Institute that had been chartered in 1858 by the Oregon Territorial Legislature. The Adams group imposed the condition that the Baptists keep at least one professor employed continuously in the college department. Other accounts indicate that the Baptist group purchased the land in 1857 in order to start their school.\nThe Oregon Territorial Legislature chartered the Baptist College at McMinnville in 1858.  The school later became McMinnville College in 1898.\nIn 1922, the name was changed to Linfield College in memory of a Baptist minister, the Rev. George Fisher Linfield whose widow, Frances Eleanor Ross Linfield, gave a substantial donation to the college to promote Christian education and as a memorial to her late husband.  Mrs. Linfield served as Dean of Women from 1921 to 1928, and sat on the Board of Directors from 1922 to her death in 1940.  Her gift included real estate in Spokane, Washington, valued at $250,000 (a sum worth nearly $4 million in 2020).  In his 1938 book, Bricks Without Straw: The Story of Linfield College, Professor Jonas A. \"Steine\" Jonasson quotes from the minutes of the college's board of trustees to explain Mrs. Linfield's motivation for her large land gift to the college: \"Mrs. Linfield's dual purpose in making the gift to McMinnville College was to 'perpetuate the name, scholarly attainments and Christian influence of her late husband, Rev. George Fisher Linfield, and to promote the cause of Christian education.'\"The Linfield Division of Continuing Education (an Adult Degree Program) began in 1975. Today it serves eight communities in Oregon as well as online degree programs giving working adults the opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree or certificate program.\nIn 1982, the Linfield College-Portland Campus was established when the college entered into an affiliation with Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital & Medical Center and began offering a bachelor's degree program in nursing.\nLinfield offered buyouts to 13 professors in liberal-arts programs with shrinking enrollment in 2019, shortly after President Miles K. Davis arrived. He also announced efforts to shift resources to the nursing and business programs, which account for the majority of students. Those shifts led to strained relationships with some faculty members in the traditional liberals arts disciplines.The school officially changed its name to Linfield University, effective on July 1, 2020.\nIn November, 2023, Davis announced his intention to resign in early 2024.

His father, William Aloysius Johnson, was an artist and principal of the Art School in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. At Stonyhurst College, Johnson received an education grounded in the Jesuit method, which he preferred over the more secularised curriculum of Oxford. While at Oxford, Johnson was tutored by the historian A. J. P. Taylor and was a member of the exclusive Stubbs Society.\nAfter graduating with a second-class honours degree, Johnson performed his national service in the Army, joining the King's Royal Rifle Corps and then the Royal Army Educational Corps, where he was commissioned as a captain (acting) based mainly in Gibraltar. Here he saw the \"grim misery and cruelty of the Franco regime\". Johnson's military record helped the Paris periodical R\u00e9alit\u00e9s hire him, where he was assistant editor from 1952 to 1955.\nJohnson adopted a left-wing political outlook during this period as he witnessed in May 1952 the police response to a riot in Paris (Communists were rioting over the visit of American general, Matthew Ridgway, who commanded the US Eighth Army during the Korean War; he had just been appointed NATO's Supreme Commander in Europe), the \"ferocity [of which] I would not have believed had I not seen it with my own eyes.\" Then he served as the New Statesman's Paris correspondent. For a time, he was a convinced Bevanite and an associate of Aneurin Bevan himself. Moving back to London in 1955, Johnson joined the Statesman's staff.Some of Johnson's writing already showed signs of iconoclasm. His first book, about the Suez War, appeared in 1957. An anonymous commentator in The Spectator wrote that \"one of his [Johnson's] remarks about Mr Gaitskell is quite as damaging as anything he has to say about Sir Anthony Eden\", but the Labour Party's opposition to the Suez intervention led Johnson to assert \"the old militant spirit of the party was back\". The following year he attacked Ian Fleming's James Bond novel Dr No, and in 1964 he warned of \"The Menace of Beatlism\" in an article contemporarily described as being \"rather exaggerated\" by Henry Fairlie in The Spectator.Johnson was successively lead writer, deputy editor and editor of the New Statesman from 1965 to 1970. He was found suspect for his attendances at the soir\u00e9es of Lady Antonia Fraser, who was at the time married to a conservative MP. There was some resistance to Johnson's appointment as New Statesman editor, not least from the writer Leonard Woolf, who objected to a Catholic filling the position, and Johnson was placed on six months' probation.Statesmen and Nations (1971), the anthology of his Statesman articles, contains numerous reviews of biographies of conservative politicians and an openness to continental Europe; in one article Johnson took a positive view of events of May 1968 in Paris, leading Colin Welch in The Spectator to accuse Johnson of possessing \"a taste for violence\".

However, as the national divide over slavery grew during the 1850s, Morrill shifted his political allegiance to the Republican Party for the sole reason that Republicans opposed the expansion of slavery. He was elected as a Republican to the Maine Senate in 1856, followed by his election as governor of Maine in 1858.\nAs the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Morrill was elected to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Maine's Hannibal Hamlin, who assumed the vice presidency under President Abraham Lincoln. Morrill's Senate tenure lasted nearly 15 years, spanning from the start of the Civil War to the waning days of Reconstruction. While in the Senate, Morrill sponsored legislation that outlawed slavery in Washington, D.C., and advocated for education and suffrage for African American freedmen.\nIn 1876, President Grant appointed Morrill to serve as U.S. treasury secretary after Secretary Benjamin Bristow resigned from the position. When Morrill left the Senate to lead the Treasury Department, his political rival James G. Blaine was appointed by Maine's governor to fill the then-vacant Senate seat. Morrill advocated strongly in support of the gold standard during his eight-month tenure as secretary. Upon his retirement from the Treasury Department in 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Morrill as collector of customs in Portland, Maine, a position he held until his death in 1883.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He has exhibited his work in New York City at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and the Society of Illustrators.Edmund White wrote in his Introduction to Dreamer:  \"Mel Odom's work represents an original synthesis of...two moments in the history of taste:  a recuperation of art-nouveau perversities of the past but in a shiny, shadowless, innocently hedonistic space....In Mel Odom's world the perverse has become at last a candid pleasure...a vision of utopia.\"\nIn 1990, Odom proposed to design the cosmetic facepaint for Mdvanii, a 25 cm limited-edition collector's fashion doll. The experience renewed his childhood interest in dolls and led him to create a doll of his own, the 15.5\" Gene Marshall. The creation of Gene Marshall helped him cope with the experience of his best friend dying of AIDS.Gene Marshall's appearance, wardrobes, and history are modelled on the glamour of Hollywood's golden age from the 1920s through 1950s. The doll made its commercial debut at the 1995 Toy Fair and was an immediate success, creating a wider market for large, fully articulated collector's fashion dolls in contrast to the slightly smaller and less flexible Barbie doll. Since then, Odom has largely concentrated his professional pursuits on the Gene Marshall doll, regularly modifying her design to create new variations and creating similar companion dolls to share her world, such as Gene's \"co-stars\" Madra Lord, Violet Waters, and Trent Osborn.\nOdom continues to attend doll collectors' conventions to make personal appearances and buy dolls for his own collection, as well as to support charitable causes.  At a 1997 doll convention entirely devoted to Gene Marshall, a charity auction of uniquely modified Gene dolls raised more than $30,000 for Gay Men's Health Crisis, an AIDS service organization.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His education was at the Crypt Grammar School from where he went to the Cathedral Grammar School, and later was apprenticed to a Dr Buchanan of Gloucester. His uncle, Daniel Ellis, a member of the Royal Society Edinburgh, suggested that he enrol as a medical student at the newly founded University College London. In his vacations he studied in Paris and attended lectures and worked at anatomy in Berlin.\nEllis was Demonstrator of Anatomy under Professor Richard Quain, and succeeded him in the Chair of Anatomy in 1850, retiring as Emeritus Professor in 1877, but always aloof from the professional world. He was succeeded by Sir George Dancer Thane (1850-1930). Ellis was one of the great names of the world of anatomy in England, having given all his working life to the study and teaching of this discipline, and was held in the highest respect. His lectures were conscientiously precise and lucid, so that his students always paid close attention.\nIn 1840 he published \"Demonstrations of Anatomy: being a Guide to the Knowledge of the Human Body by Dissections\", his name becoming a household word among medical students, and his work becoming the standard textbook in England and the United States. The 11th edition of his book was published in 1890.\nUniversity College London in its first thirty-five years of existence, published an extraordinary number of anatomical atlases. Ellis carried on this tradition by collaborating with the South African natural history illustrator, George Henry Ford, to produce some of the best anatomical artwork ever published. They used the relatively new technique of chromolithography for their imperial folio atlas of fifty-eight plates, \"Illustrations of Dissections in a Series of Original Coloured Plates the Size of Life\". The plates were done between 1863 and 1867, with from four to seven completed each year. These plates are considered exceptionally clear and accurate, with an aesthetic depiction of the cadavers, printed by Mintern Bros., and published by James Walton.During Ellis' tenure the University College London was regarded as the pre-eminent centre for the study of anatomy, its spacious and well-lit dissecting room approved of by both staff and students. The College was fortunate in acquiring and retaining the services of an anatomist of Ellis' stature - his culture, zeal, and energy were legendary - receiving only a moderate salary and with no prospect of career improvement. In Ellis' day cadavers were not treated with any preservatives, so that they were often in an advanced state of putrefaction, limiting dissection to the winter months. Several times he acted as Examiner in Anatomy at the University of London, but declined to join the Court of Examiners of the Royal College of Surgeons.\nOn his retirement Ellis came into a small fortune left him by a relative, built himself a house at Minsterworth, 'Severn Bank', and lived there quietly with his younger sister, devoting himself to gardening and apple-growing. He also ran night classes for the older boys of the parish. A few years before his death he became blind and was tended by his sister.\"Ellis' muscle\", the Corrugator cutis ani muscle, is named after him.", "hasanswer": true}]}

When she was eighteen, she enrolled in the Art Students League of New York where she took classes from John Twachtman and George Bridgman.  She then traveled to Paris in 1902 to continue her studies at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian where she was the first woman to be awarded the Concours Julian-Smith in 1904.On her return to the United States, she began to earn commissions mainly for her meticulous illustrations in magazines and books, like those she drew for Helen Hay Whitney's book of poems, entitled Herbs and Apples (1910). In San Antonio, Texas, she helped form the San Antonio Conversation Society in 1924.  In 1926 she met Diego Rivera. As Rivera was finishing his mural project at the Ministry of Education in Mexico City, Mrs. Van Horn joined him and other artists in the production of the work.  Rivera painted her face in one of the murals on the third floor of the building.For four years (1928\u20131932), she and her husband lived in Berkeley, California where she joined various art leagues and worked with prominent artists in the Bay Area, including John Emmett Gerrity, David Park and Galka Scheyer who represented The Blue Four:  European abstractionists, Feininger, Kandinsky, Jawlensky and Klee. She also became a member of the San Francisco Art Association and the Society of Women Artist, won several notable awards, and was included in a major international retrospective at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco as one of thirty-five American artists.During a trip to Mexico is 1926, Van Horn met and befriended Diego Rivera. He was working on a mural for the Ministry of Education in Mexico city at the time. During her time in Mexico, Van Horn was greatly influenced by Rivera which led to a major transformation in her work. Her subject matter became mostly native peasant women, pictured in an outside setting and much more simplified than her earlier works.She returned to Berkeley in 1941 after her husband died. She contacted an old Berkeley colleague, Marjorie Eaton who lived in Palo Alto on the Juana Briones Ranch, owned by Ms. Eaton's mother. There she spent the last twenty-eight years of her life. \nMrs. Van Horn's life was peripatetic and at times difficult.  Her mother died when she was three, and shortly after moved from her family's sugar plantation on the Mississippi River to New Orleans.  When she fourteen, she went to live in Washington, D.C., with her socially and politically involved aunt and uncle, Martha and Herbert Wadsworth.\nIn Washington she met Douglas MacArthur, who fell in love with her, as evidenced by a recently discovered cache of letters written to her by him. Around the same time she met her husband Robert Osborn Van Horn; they were married in 1908. Van Horn was also a military officer who subsequently served under MacArthur during the First World War and retired as a brigadier general in 1940.\nDuring her married years, Van Horn lived in many places: Cuba, Georgia, Kansas, Texas, and California. She and her husband had two daughters: Margaret born in 1909 and Lucretia in 1916. When Margaret contracted tuberculosis and died in 1932, Van Horn, devastated by the loss, left her family for some time.  It is not clear where she went or for how long.\nVan Horn's artistic evolution went through at least three distinctive phases.  Her early illustrations reflect her attraction to the work of Maxfield Parrish, her work of the late 1920s and 1930s are patterned on the images of Diego Rivera, and her later work was influenced by the European abstractionists, most especially her favorite, Paul Klee.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Oberholtzer attended Harvard University and received a bachelor of arts degree, but left after one year of graduate study in landscape architecture.  He made his first trip to the Minnesota-Ontario border lakes in 1906.\nIn 1909 he took his first extended canoe voyage through the border lakes and the Rainy Lake watershed, traveling 3,000 miles that summer.  During the period from 1908 to 1915, Oberholtzer wrote a number of articles and short stories, some under the penname Ernest Carliowa.  Many of the stories and articles were based on his canoe trip experiences.  In 1913, Oberholtzer moved to Rainy Lake.  He purchased Mallard Island in 1922; the tiny island would be his home for more than 50 years.\nAfter plans were announced by business mogul Edward Backus to construct a series of dams to harness the Rainy Lake watershed for power generation, Oberholtzer spoke in opposition at a hearing of the International Joint Commission held at International Falls in September 1925.

Oberholtzer served as its first president.  His activities for the council included lobbying United States Congress and the Minnesota legislature, testifying before the International Joint Commission and building public support for the council's program.

Between his conventional education at Charterhouse School and New College, Oxford, where he obtained only a pass degree, Gardiner was a piano student at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, where he was taught by Iwan Knorr and Lazzaro Uzielli, who had been a pupil of Clara Schumann. He belonged to the Frankfurt Group, a circle of composers who studied at the Hoch Conservatory in the late 1890s. With George Gardiner (no relation) he collected folk songs in Hampshire (1905\u20131906), taught music briefly at Winchester College (1907), and composed. His works included compositions in a variety of genres, including two symphonies (No 2 premiered at the Proms in 1908), but many of his scores, including the symphonies, are lost and only a very limited amount of his music survives.\nHis best-known work Evening Hymn (1908), a setting of the compline hymn \"Te lucis ante terminum\", is a lush, romantic work for eight-part choir and organ, of dense harmonies. For most of the time, it sits in four parts, though the treble, alto, tenor, and bass parts all subdivide at various points. It is considered a classic of the English choral repertoire and is still regularly performed as an anthem at Evensong in Anglican churches.The fame of this work has overshadowed his surviving orchestral works, which include Overture to a Comedy (1906, revised 1911), the Percy Grainger-like Shepherd Fennell's Dance (1911) (once a favourite at the Proms, chalking up 35 performances between 1911 and 1951), and the Delius-like A Berkshire Idyll, the latter written in 1913 at Field House, Ashampstead Green in Berkshire, where he lived between 1911 and 1930. The first performance of the Idyll (along with two other unpublished pieces, Philomela and the choral setting April), took place on 6 May 1955 at the Royal Festival Hall, 42 years after its completion. It was recorded in 2017 for the first time.Also surviving are a number of short piano works and songs. There is also the one movement String Quartet in Bb major, composed in 1905 and premiered that year on 28 February by the Cathie String Quartet at the Aeolian Hall. It has been recorded by the Tippett Quartet.Gardiner's most important work, possibly, was his promotion of the music of contemporary British and colonial composers, particularly through a series of concerts he personally financed at Queen's Hall London in 1912 to 1913. The composers represented included Arnold Bax, Frederic Austin, Gustav Holst, Percy Grainger, Roger Quilter, Cyril Scott and Norman O'Neill. (The last four had also studied with him at Frankfurt.) Gardiner was very generous with his personal fortune, paying for a private benefit performance of The Planets for Holst in 1918 and purchasing Frederick Delius's house at Grez-sur-Loing to enable him to continue living in it at the end of his life. In the early 1920s he also became a patron of Charles Kennedy Scott, conductor and founder of the Philharmonic Choir which was the predecessor of the present London Philharmonic Choir.Gardiner gave up composing in 1925 largely because he was intensely self-critical: much of his lost music was probably destroyed by him. Thereafter, he devoted himself to a pioneering afforestation programme on his Dorset pig farm. He died in hospital in Salisbury after suffering a stroke.He was the great-uncle of the conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner.", "hasanswer": true}]}

As described by writer Rani Molla: \"Santa Fe filmmakers Jon Moritsugu and Amy Davis veer (very slightly) from their underground experimental base with a music video released today for popular Brooklyn experimental band TV on the Radio. The video is one in a movie-length series of music videos for the band's new album Nine Types of Light\". In 2012, the project received a Grammy Nomination in the \"Long Form Music Video\" category.In 2013 Pig Death Machine premiered at the Chicago Underground Film Festival, where Moritsugu and Davis won the \"Jack Smith Lifetime Achievement Award.\" The movie screened at a number of US and international film festivals and also made it onto several \"Best Films of 2013\" lists including one compiled by critic Jack Sargeant. It then opened theatrically across America and also played with the Moritsugu retrospective of 7 features and 9 shorts in select cities including Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. Pig Death Machine received glowing reviews from the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and LA Weekly.In 2015, Anthology Film Archives of New York City completed a two-year restoration project of Moritsugu's 1987 senior thesis film, Der Elvis. With support from the National Film Preservation Foundation and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the movie was digitally scanned, remastered, reprinted in 16mm and described as, \"one of the most impressive and precocious student films ever made\".Later that year, Moritsugu wrote and directed his first fashion video lookbook. Created for Mishka NYC's fall 2015 collection, the project was co-written and photographed by Davis and featured the music of Low on High.Also in 2015, James Schamus, former CEO of Focus Features, stated to the New York Times: \"Jon is a true cinema original. I'd rather be spit on by Jon than kissed by 95 percent of the directors out there.\"In September 2016, an exhibition of seven Moritsugu features opened at the Ramiken Crucible in NYC. Entitled \"Semiotics of Sleaze,\" the movies were projected simultaneous on the gallery's walls for a one-month run. The Village Voice wrote: \"Jon Moritsugu's cinema is aggressive, abrasive, and it doesn't stop. His zero-budget movies have spastic editing, disorienting post-sync sound, and bright neon colors; they're a treat for the senses, and poison for the mind... While watching his films, you may feel tired, weak, or nauseous, but you will have had an experience, and a physical one at that \u2013 an effect to which many moving images can't lay claim... The gallery is showing these works simultaneously and blasting them at full volume; you'll feel the noise.\"In August 2017, Moritsugu wrapped principal photography for his eighth feature, Numbskull Revolution. Shot in New Mexico, the movie aims to \"satirize and deconstruct the high art scene in an eyeball-scorching onslaught of mind-blowing narrative madness and honey-laced pathos\".\" It stars James Duval as artist \"Futurecide\" and Amy Davis as twin sisters.Moritsugu landed a book deal in 2018. His memoir titled \"SKULLFUCK: The Brutalist Cinema of Jon Moritsugu\" was released in January 2022  and was published by Kaya.

He was born in Velyka Znamianka, Ukraine in a poor Jewish family as the 9th child. He completed secondary education in Kherson, Ukraine; then studied for a year in Rostov, Russia and moved to Saint Petersburg seeking university degree. There he studied in several technical universities. Engineering however did not attract Shatunovsky and he dedicated himself to mathematics, voluntarily attending lectures by Chebyshev. Shatunovsky could not complete any university program due to lack of funds. He later attempted to obtain a university degree in Switzerland, but failed for the same reason. After returning from Switzerland, he lived in small Russian towns, earning by private lessons. In the meantime, he wrote his first mathematical papers and sent some of them to Odesa University. Their quality was acknowledged; Shatunovsky was admitted to the university, received financial support, obtained a degree and was appointed as staff member in 1905. In 1917, he became a professor and continued working at the Odesa University through the rest of his life.Shatunovsky focused on several topics in mathematical analysis and algebra, such as group theory, number theory and geometry. Independently from Hilbert, he developed a similar axiomatic theory and applied it in geometry, algebra, Galois theory and analysis. However, most of his activity was devoted to teaching at Odesa University and writing associated books and study materials.Shatunovsky died in 1929 from stomach cancer two days after his 70th birthday. Despite severe pain associated with his illness, he kept his usual sense of humor and continued to lecture almost until the day he died.

(Durkin) and Luke Joseph Higgins. Her father was an Irish immigrant and her mother was American-born, also of Irish descent. The United States census gives her age in April 1940 as 12, which indicates her year of birth is 1927, as that was her age at her last birthday, the question asked by census enumerators.She was born about a year and a half after the birth of her older brother, Joseph. Her younger brother John, followed three years later. Even as a small child, she was interested in writing, composing her first poem at age seven and often crafting short plays for her friends to enact. She began keeping a journal when she was seven years old, noting in her first entry, \"Nothing much happened today.\"The family lived off the earnings from their Irish pub and were fairly well-off, owning a home in the Bronx and a summer cottage on Long Island Sound. Although the Great Depression began when Higgins Clark was still a baby, her family was initially not affected, and even insisted on feeding the men who knocked on their door looking for work. By the time Higgins Clark was ten, however, the family began to experience financial trouble, as many of their customers were unable to pay the bar tabs they had run up. Higgins Clark's father was forced to lay off several employees and work longer hours, spending no more than a few hours at home each day. The family was thrown into further turmoil in 1939, when young Mary returned home from an early Mass to discover that her father had died in his sleep.Nora Higgins, now a widow with three young children to support, soon discovered that few employers were willing to hire a 52-year-old woman who had not held a job in over fourteen years. To pay the bills, Higgins Clark was forced to move out of her bedroom so that her mother could rent it out to paying boarders. Six months after their father's death, Higgins Clark's older brother cut his foot on a piece of metal and contracted severe osteomyelitis. Higgins Clark and her mother prayed constantly for him, and their neighbors came en masse to give blood for the many transfusions the young boy needed. Despite the dire predictions of the doctors, Joseph Higgins survived. Higgins Clark credits his recovery to the power of their prayers.When Higgins Clark graduated from Saint Francis Xavier Grammar School, she received a scholarship to continue her education at the Villa Maria Academy, a school run by the nuns of the Congregation de Notre Dame de Montreal. There, the principal and other teachers encouraged Higgins Clark to develop her writing, although they were somewhat less than pleased when she began spending her class time writing stories instead of paying attention to the lesson. At sixteen, Higgins Clark made her first attempt at publishing her work, sending an entry to True Confessions, which was rejected.To help pay the bills, she worked as a switchboard operator at the Shelton Hotel, where she often listened in to the residents' conversations. In her memoir she recalls spending much time eavesdropping on Tennessee Williams but complained that he never said anything interesting. On her days off, Higgins Clark would window shop, mentally choosing the clothes she would wear when she finally became a famous writer.Despite Higgins Clark's contribution to the family finances, the money her mother earned babysitting was not enough, and the family lost their house and moved into a small three-room apartment. When Joseph graduated from high school in 1944, he immediately enlisted in the Navy, both to serve his country during war and to help his mother pay her bills. Six months after his enlistment he contracted spinal meningitis and died. Although the family mourned Joseph's death deeply, as his dependent, Nora was guaranteed a life pension and no longer needed her daughter's help to pay the bills.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Due to competition from specialist frozen food chains such as Bejam, Sainsbury's converted its original service shops that were too small for modern use to small frozen specialist shops. Despite initial difficulty as only 11% of the population owned a freezer, the chain expanded to 21 shops at its height. As freezers became more popular, frozen food departments were designed into Sainsbury's main supermarkets, and the chain was sold to Bejam in 1986, who were ultimately sold to Iceland in 1989.\nSainsbury's SavaCentre\nSavaCentre was a chain of 13 hypermarkets and 7 discount supermarkets operated between 1977 and 2005, initially in a joint venture with BHS. The shops ranged in size between 66,000 sq ft (6,100 m2) and 117,000 sq ft (10,900 m2), and the discount supermarkets between 31,000 sq ft (2,900 m2) and 70,000 sq ft (6,500 m2). At the time of its inception it was the only dedicated hypermarket chain in the UK. Shop layout consisted of a 50:50 split between food and non-food shopping, with a complete range of both retailers' products, and later included input from Habitat and Mothercare as they merged with BHS. Some shops also included features such as a petrol station and in-shop cafe. In 1989 Sainsbury's bought out BHS's stake, but still allowed BHS to retail from SavaCentres until it offered its own clothing and merchandise offering.\nSainsbury's Calais Wine ShopSainsbury's operated one alcohol hypermarket in partnership with Auchan in Calais, France for the lucrative UK booze cruise market. The shop closed in 2010 after describing the operation as 'economically unviable'.\nSainsbury's MarketIn 2002, Sainsbury's opened an experimental shop in the Bluebird Building in Chelsea, London. The concept of the 'Market' shop was to provide a large range of fresh meat, fish, delicatessen items and bread through staff serving over counters. Staff were specially hired for their skill and passion for their roles in-shop. The layout also provided a larger than usual area for retailing fresh produce. The shop closed in 2004 after poor results. A second, much larger version in Pimlico was designated as a 'Market' shop, but the shop's branding and layout was gradually reverted to a standard Sainsbury's shop.\nFresh KitchenIn 2011, Sainsbury's opened a trial food to go shop in Fleet Street London selling sandwiches, baguettes and hot snacks in an effort to expand its business into new areas of opportunity. The shop closed a year later, after the shop's lease was not renewed. Sainsbury's commented that footfall was too high to offer high standards of quality and service however it was not ruling out performing another trial in another location, explaining that it had learnt a lot. In 2020, Sainsbury's began to rebrand some in-store caf\u00e9s to \" Fresh Kitchen\".\nMobile by Sainsbury's\nSainsbury's operated a virtual mobile network from 2001 until 2003 which closed due to being commercially unsustainable. In 2013 Sainsbury's re-entered the UK telecommunications industry when it launched a mobile phone network called Mobile by Sainsbury's. The virtual network was operated in partnership with Vodafone. The network was promoted heavily in-shop and most supermarkets started retailing SIM cards and handsets for the network. However, in 2015 Sainsbury's announced that the service would be closing in January 2016 after a breakdown in the relationship with its provider Vodafone.\nSainsbury's Compare and SaveSainsbury's Compare and Save was a comparison and switching service website that promoted a wide range of television, broadband and telephone deals from a variety of providers. The service, free to Sainsbury's customers, claimed to list 15,000 different packages. The website and service launched in 2008 and was operated by SimplifyDigital.\nSainsbury's PharmacySainsbury's operated 270 pharmacies within its supermarkets. Sainsbury's also operated pharmacies at three major UK hospitals: Guy's Hospital, St Thomas' Hospital and James Cook University Hospital. In July 2015 Sainsbury's announced it was selling its 281 pharmacies to Lloydspharmacy for \u00a3125 million with all 2,500 pharmacy employees being transferred and new rent agreements being made. In June 2023, Lloyds Pharmacy announced that all Lloyds Pharmacies within Sainsbury's stores would close.\nSainsbury's EntertainmentSainsbury's Entertainment was a transactional website which provided films as downloads or for streaming, using Rovi Corporation software. The site arranged to register with ATVOD as a video on demand service. The website also sold MP3 downloads as well as eBooks through aNobii. The site began operating in 2010 and until March 2014 also sold physical products including DVDs, CDs, Blu-ray discs and books. These were posted to the customer by a distributor, which after 2011 was Sainsbury's subsidiary company: Global Media Vault Ltd. Customers received nectar points from shopping at Sainsbury's Entertainment. Sainsbury's announced in September 2016 that it would close the business on 30 November 2016.\nSainsbury's Welcome Break PartnershipIn 2006, Sainsbury's opened a Convenience store at Birchanger Green services, operated by owners Welcome Break.\nSainsbury's Euro Garages PartnershipSainsbury's trialed franchising their convenience store format to Euro Garages who planned to operate six small stores within its service stations, replacing some of its hundreds of SPAR stores, the first time Sainsbury's has trusted a third party to operate a Sainsbury's store since 2006. Beginning in Blackburn in 2016 Sainsbury's re-trained EuroGarages staff of 15 to operate the convenience store and later followed with stores in Heathrow and Bury. In February 2018 Sainsbury's issued a statement calling a mutual end to the trial: \"following a commercial review, a joint decision has been made to bring the trial to a close.\"  In 2019, the partnership was continued with a new format called \"Sainsbury's on the Go\" aimed at travellers, carrying travel and snack products. These stores were opened in spaces at former Little Chef restaurants and in the petrol stations, replacing SPAR. In October 2020, the Issa Brothers bought ASDA and rebranded some stores to \"ASDA on the Move\" and the ones in the former Little Chef restaurants to SPAR. Few stores remain in the petrol stations, waiting for a rebrand whilst others in the former restaurants are now empty.\nSainsbury's Club StoreNot to be confused with SavaCentre stores, this was a one-off store at Castle Court in Bristol, designed purely to satisfy an existing planning requirement. Shoppers were only allowed to enter the store if registered members and resident within a 20 mile radius. This was due to having been opened by wholesaler Nurdin and Peacock (now part of Booker Group) in 1995 as a 'Cargo Club' members only store similar in format to Costco. Within a year new planning permission was obtained and all membership and residence options were dropped, the store was renamed and has been a regular supermarket since.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Alleyne meets up again with Aylward and Hordle John, and the three friends meet Sir Nigel and his formidable wife Mary. There, he learns that Maude is Sir Nigel's daughter.

Sir Nigel is startled by the news and Alleyne's declaration, but indicates that he prefers that Alleyne should be a full knight before he approaches Maude again with talk of love. The Spanish and French attack them in a narrow ravine, where the mighty warriors are almost all destroyed and the Company must disband\u2014only seven bowmen remain, including John.

In the years 1922\u20131929 he published work on the Polish pony (Badania nad konikiem polskim z okolic Bi\u0142goraja and Dalsze badania nad konikiem polskim). He is credited with introducing the term \"Polish pony\" or Polish konik into the hippological literature in the mid-1920s.Zbigniew Jaworski of the Polish Academy of Sciences says that \"based on his research and observations, he hypothesized that a forest variety of the tarpan (Equus cab. gmelini Ant., forma silvatica Vet.) had split off from the populations living in the steppes of Eastern Europe and had survived into the mid 18th century in the lands of Poland, Lithuania, and Prussia.\"In 1926, Vetulani received a doctoral degree in agriculture at the Jagiellonian University. Three years later he obtained his degree of associate professor in animal husbandry. From 1931 to 1935 he worked as an associate professor and head of the Department of Animal Breeding at the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius. In February 1936, he founded a reserve and restoration scheme in Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest involving the breeding of Polish koniks, putting his early hypothesis to practice. Helmut Hemmer says that \"Tadeusz Vetulani purchased animals with particularly high resemblance to tarpans and subjected them to a selection programme carried out in the Institute for Genetics and Animal Breeding of the Polish Academy.\"\nFrom 1938, Vetulani was co-editor of the German journal \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Z\u00fcchtungsbiologie.\" In 1939 he represented Poland in Z\u00fcrich in an international conference on breeding.During World War II, the horses introduced by Vetulani to Bia\u0142owie\u017ca were removed by German brothers Heinz Heck and Lutz Heck and brought to Munich and Berlin to be used as breeding stock for their own attempt to recreate the tarpan, which would ultimately produce a horse breed known as Heck horses. Vetulani viewed this as a \"baffling campaign of destruction\", and the removal of the animals ultimately ended his breeding program.During World War II Vetulani lived in Krak\u00f3w, working as a clerk in the Polish Red Cross from 1940\u20131943. He was a spokesperson for the organization against the occupation authorities. He also aided in the care of Polish prisoners of war. Vetulani rejected all proposals for collaboration with the Nazis and also refused to join the committee appointed to audit the Katyn graves, not wanting to serve the German propaganda.Between 1945\u20131952 worked in restoration and increasing the breeding of the Polish pony.

Hiss's lawyers then hired Tytell to create a typewriter that would be indistinguishable from the one the Hiss's owned.

[Y]ou and I were of that country. Our eyes were turned towards it in admiration and in my part in gratitude. My children were from there. They and yours will soon be.\"\nWhilst in Oahu, Atherton met Captain Alpheus Basil Thompson (1795\u20131869), a seagoing merchant from Santa Barbara, who was originally from Brunswick, Maine, who by the 1830s had become engaged in the hides and tallow trade along the Californian coastline. Thompson had married into the powerful Carrillo family. This would have opened doors for Atherton, who became acquainted with influential  Californian leaders, both Mexican officials and American entrepreneurs, as well the foremost influential Californios; including the Vallejos, Bandinis, and De la Guerras.\nWhen Atherton traveled to Alta California with Thompson on the ship Bolivar Libertador in 1836, arriving in San Francisco, the city was in its infancy. Atherton worked for Thompson for a period of two years, initially accepting a position as a clerk for $50 a month. He would soon be tasked to travel the California coast, between San Francisco and San Diego, selling goods to rancheros from Thompson's home port of Santa Barbara.  During this period, Atherton penned his California diary and formed friendships with many prominent Californians, including Carlos Antonio Carrillo, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Carrillo, Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, Juan Bandini and Thomas O. Larkin, the United States Consul at Monterey (with whom he \nwould later be associated with in many real estate and commercial ventures).\nSeveral governors of the Mexican era were also his friends, among them Nicolas Gutierrez, Jos\u00e9 Castro, and Mariano Chico, as were many traders such as W. E. P. Hartnell, Nathan Spear; and the latter's nephew, William Heath Davis, Jr.\nThis was time of influx of settlers from New England into the Pacific coast. His friend, William Heath Davis came from a Boston seafaring, ship-owning family. Davis was a clerk of a store in Monterey which was owned by his uncle, Nathan Spear. Like Atherton he liked the daughters of powerful men. Davis engaged in trading trips to Yerba Buena and the Hawaiian Islands and settled permanently in San Francisco, subsequently becoming one of the city's most prominent merchants and ship owners. Davis later married Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas Estudillo, daughter of Joaquin Estudillo, a wealthy rancher.\nIn 1839 Atherton was described by John Sutter as an upstanding merchant from Honolulu who later moved to California (although Atherton's own diary brings his moral character into question - see \"Legacy,\" below). Sutter enjoyed dining with Atherton during his stay in Honolulu, whilst he waited for a boat to take him to California. During 1839, Atherton left Oahu on the Don Quixote, and sailed back to New England (via Valpara\u00edso and Cape Horn) with 540 hides valued at $1000. He arrived in Boston during May and sold his cargo in Boston. Whilst in Boston he tried unsuccessfully to raise $4,500 to build a highway between Valparaiso and Santiago. Instead he returned to Chile with a $259 rotary printing press and a supply of enamel \"address cards\".\nHe established a ship chandler's store in Valparaiso, whilst at the same time trading in the hide and tallow and other merchandise.\nIt was during this time that he met George Henry Bowen, who would become his business partner and lifelong friend.", "hasanswer": false}]}

While on summer vacation in Avalon (New Jersey), after attending Swarthmore College for a year, she met and eloped with Richard J. Westcott in 1931, the couple then residing in Camden (New Jersey) where Jan Westcott became a \"stay at home mom\" to the couple's two sons. Her longstanding interest in history, passed down from her father, was reinforced by the outbreak of World War II. After her husband left to join the army in 1943, Westcott tried her hand at writing a historical novel, which she worked on while her sons were at school and after putting them to bed. The resultant novel, The Border Lord, was published in 1946.Divorcing her first husband in 1947, Westcott in 1954 married Robert Phelps Barden, the chief radiologist of Chestnut Hill Hospital (Philadelphia). The couple, who had met while both were summering in Avalon, subsequently resided for many years in Philadelphia's Chestnut Hill neighborhood.

He had three younger brothers: David, who became a banker; John, who became a diplomat; and Robert, who became a songwriter. He was educated at Washington, D.C., schools, and Western High School, where he joined the High School Cadets in 1916.In 1920 Birch  entered Harvard University on a scholarship. While there he served in Harvard's Reserve Officers' Training Corps Field Artillery Battalion. He graduated magna cum laude in 1924, and received his Bachelor of Science (S.B.) degree in electrical engineering.Birch went to work in the Engineering Department of the New York Telephone Company. He applied for and received an American Field Service Fellowship in 1926, which he used to travel to Strasbourg, and study at the University of Strasbourg's Institut de Physique under the tutelage of Pierre Weiss. There, he wrote or co-wrote four papers, in French, on topics such as the paramagnetic properties of potassium cyanide, and the magnetic moment of Cu++ ions.On returning to the United States in 1928, Birch went back to Harvard to pursue physics. He was awarded his Master of Arts (A.M.) degree in 1929, and then commenced work on his 1932 Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree under the supervision of Percy Bridgman, who would receive the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1946.

Weeks (n\u00e9e Shoemaker) (March 13, 1852 \u2013 November 28, 1930), who married on January 14, 1874, in Fort Union, New Mexico. He was born in Fort McIntosh, Texas, where his father, a West Point graduate and career military officer originally from Allegan, Michigan, was stationed at the time. His parents met while his father was stationed at Fort Union, New Mexico, as his mother's family was from nearby rural Mora County, New Mexico. He spent his early childhood growing up on military posts in New Mexico and Texas, where his father was stationed until the family finally moved back to his father's native Allegan, Michigan in 1888. He was the fourth-oldest of eight brothers, five of whom played football for the University of Michigan, and one sister. Three of the brothers earned varsity letters in football, and the oldest of those three brothers, Alanson Weeks (September 15, 1877 \u2013 November 25, 1947), played halfback for the 1898 Michigan team that won the school's first Western Conference championship. His eldest brother, Frank Russel Weeks (March 21, 1876 \u2013 March 2, 1947), instead became a soldier like their father and later a civil servant working for the US Treasury Department.\nBoss Weeks enrolled at Michigan in 1899 and played on the school's \"scrub team\" as a freshman. As a sophomore, Weeks made the varsity football team where he was the backup quarterback to Edwin McGinnis. In 1901, a new era in Michigan football began as Fielding H. Yost was hired as the school's new football coach. Yost immediately taught Weeks and the Michigan team a new, lightning-fast offense. Under the new scheme, Weeks would call the signals for the next play without a huddle, sometimes while he was \"still under the pile from the previous play.\" If a player was too slow getting line up for the next play, Yost would yell from the sideline, \"Are you a spectator? Hurry up! Hurry up!\"\nWeeks started all 11 games at quarterback for the 1901 Michigan Wolverines and had tremendous success with Yost's new system. In the early days of football when Weeks played, the quarterback was the true field general, as there were no communications with the bench, and the quarterback had the responsibility to call the plays on both offense and defense. The 1901 team led by Weeks went undefeated and scored 550 points, earning the team the nickname, \"Point-a-Minute.\" The 1901 team was equally strong on defense, not allowing a single point to be scored through the entire season, and not allowing another team to make a gain of more than 15 yards on a single play. Michigan was invited to play in the first Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California, on January 1, 1902, where they defeated Stanford, 49\u20130.\nThe following June, the Michigan team elected Weeks as the captain of the 1902 team. Weeks led the 1902 team to another 11\u20130 record, and the team increased its offensive scoring output to an unprecedented 644 points. The team scored 119 points against Michigan Agricultural and 107 points against Iowa. The only minor blemish on the record of the 1902 team was that, after not allowing opponents to score a single point in 1901, the defense gave up a total of 12 points in 11 games.Some consider the 1901 and 1902 \"Point-a-Minute\" teams to be the greatest teams in Michigan Wolverines football history. Looking back in 1930, Fielding Yost said of Weeks: \"Michigan had one outstanding leader: Boss Weeks, quarterback of the first two teams I coached here. Weeks was the leader without reproach. He drove two Michigan teams to a total of 1,211 points against 12. Had he told either team to charge a stone wall, it would have done so, I believe, so much did the teams believe in him.\"In addition to his talent at football, Weeks was reported to have been \"a clever student,\" a member of the Delta Chi fraternity, and one of the most popular students on the campus.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After finishing elementary school, Margita enrolled in the Josip Slavenski Music High School from which she graduated as the most talented pianist in her class alongside Ivo Pogoreli\u0107. Her impressive school performance led to an offer of further studies at the famed Moscow Conservatory, which she ended up turning down due to family reasons\u2014her mother very much disliked the idea of letting her go to Moscow by herself at such a young age. Instead, Margita enrolled at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Architecture where she was no less successful. Throughout her architecture studies she still continued practicing the piano as well as playing and occasionally touring with various small orchestras.\nAfter graduating university in 1982, along with her then-boyfriend Sr\u0111an Vejvoda, the older brother of Goran Vejvoda, she began to take an interest in Belgrade's underground music scene, which struck her as a completely different lifestyle from the one she was used to. During the spring of 1982, she was introduced to Milan Mladenovi\u0107 by her cousin Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107. Soon thereafter, at one of Katarina II's early rehearsals, she got an offer to join the band. After returning from a three-month trip to South America, she decided to take the still-standing offer, joining Katarina II in late 1982.\nMargita was Katarina II/Ekatarina Velika's member until its very end in late 1994. During her time with the band, she also collaborated on the albums of many other Yugoslav bands such as Karlowy Vary produced by Tomo in der M\u00fchlen, Elvis J.

During 1994\u201395 she played in a band called Kurajberi, which gathered several Belgrade musicians and was focused mainly on performing covers at club gigs and jam sessions. In 1995, with a group of young Belgrade musicians involved in a techno movement, she formed a band called EQV and released an album Ti si sav moj bol named after the famous Ekatarina Velika song off S' vetrom uz lice, the album itself containing a techno version of the same song. The album was published by the Austrian label Coop Arts & Crafts Unlimited. In October of the same year, EQV participated in Tactic Festival in Vienna. She further continued contributing as a guest star on albums and concerts of many Serbian bands and occasionally played with bands the Glissers, Zion Banda and Direktori. Magi played keyboards in Belgrade's band the Glissers in 1995 and 1996. They performed on a weekly basis and released a CD The Glissers Vol. 1 for IMAGO Records. She also designed the cover for it.

He was elected to the United States Senate in 1972, defeating appointed U.S. Senator David H. Gambrell in the Democratic primary and U.S. Rep. Fletcher Thompson in the general election. Nunn retired from the Senate in 1997, offering a lack of \"zest and enthusiasm\" as justification.During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Nunn served as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He also served on the Intelligence and Small Business Committees. His legislative achievements include the landmark Department of Defense Reorganization Act, drafted with the late Senator Barry Goldwater, and the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which provided assistance to Russia and the former Soviet republics for securing and destroying their excess nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program deactivated more than 7,600 nuclear warheads. He was supposedly a top choice to be Secretary of Defense or State in 1992 and 1996 and in a prospective Gore cabinet in 2000.Overall, Nunn was a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who often broke with his party on a host of social and economic issues. He opposed the budget bill of 1993, which included provisions to raise taxes to reduce the budget deficit. He neither supported nor opposed Hillary Clinton's attempt to establish universal health care, though he spoke out very strongly against the proposed insurance mandate.Nunn actively worked to block President Bill Clinton's proposal to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military. LGBT activist David Mixner openly referred to Nunn as an \"old fashioned bigot\" for opposing Clinton's plan to lift the military, though this was also reported to have angered the White House.In 2008, Nunn endorsed a new Pentagon study to examine the issue of homosexuals serving openly in the military: \"I think [when] 15 years go by on any personnel policy, it's appropriate to take another look at it\u2014see how it's working, ask the hard questions, hear from the military. Start with a Pentagon study.\"According to opensecrets.org, Sam Nunn received about $2.4 million during his 1989\u20131994 political career.  His main contributors were the finance/insurance/real estate sector (totaling $411,665; $46,660 was received from Goldman, Sachs & Co), the defense industry, lawyers and lobbyists, the alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages industry (including Coca-Cola), and the agriculture sector.He voted in favor of school prayer, capping punitive damage awards, amending the U.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget, and limiting death penalty appeals. On certain issues like abortion, the environment, gun control, and affirmative action, Nunn took a more liberal line. He consistently voted in favor of increased immigration. One of his most controversial votes was his vote against the Gulf War.In September 1994, Nunn, former President Jimmy Carter and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell were asked by President Bill Clinton to go to Haiti to force the departure of the military dictator Lieutenant General Raoul C\u00e9dras. In 1994 Clinton publicly demanded that the Haitian government step aside and restore democratic rule. Clinton deployed a large military force to surround the country in September 1994. Just before the troops reached Haiti, Clinton sent a delegation led by Carter, Nunn and Powell to urge C\u00e9dras to step down and leave the country. C\u00e9dras agreed and surrendered the government, and he and his top lieutenants left the country in October. Just days later, American forces escorted the country's elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, into the capital. Afterwards, Clinton lavished praise on Nunn's delegation for averting a military strike on the nation. \"As all of you know, at my request, President Carter, Gen. Colin Powell, and Sen. Sam Nunn went to Haiti to facilitate the dictators' departure. I have been in constant contact with them for the last two days. They have worked tirelessly, almost around the clock, and I want to thank them for undertaking this crucial mission on behalf of all Americans\", Clinton said.Upon his exit from the Senate at the end of 1996, Nunn was the recipient of bipartisan praise from his colleagues. Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia concluded, \"Senator Nunn quickly established himself as one of the leading experts in the Congress and, indeed, all of the United States on national security and foreign policy. He gained a reputation in our country and, indeed, worldwide as a global thinker, and that is where I think he will make his greatest contribution in the years to come, wherever he may be, in terms of being a global thinker.

As a school boy, he conducted water analysis with the Leeds City Analyst. He was taught chemistry by Julius B. Cohen at the University of Leeds, and then he worked with Albrecht Kossel on arginase at the University of Heidelberg. He joined Columbia University in 1905, working in the lab of Christian Herter. During his work on amino acids he obtained his PhD from Leeds. In 1905, he was one of the first scientists to successfully synthesise adrenaline in the laboratory (see: History of catecholamine research).\nIn 1914 he went back to England to offer his service with the war effort. Due to a request for a chemist by Alexis Carrel to the Rockefeller Institute, Dakin joined Carrel in 1916 at a temporary hospital in Compi\u00e8gne. There they developed the Carrel\u2013Dakin method of wound treatments. This consisted of intermittently irrigating the wound with Dakin's solution, a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite (the active ingredient in common liquid bleach products) and boric acid.  In the process, he analyzed more than 200 candidate substances, and developed quantitative methods to evaluate their effectiveness for disinfection and wound healing. The solution is still widely used for that purpose, as of 2013. The World War I era Rockefeller War Demonstration Hospital (United States Army Auxiliary Hospital No. 1) was created, in part, to promote the Carrel\u2013Dakin method:\n\"The war demonstration hospital of the Rockefeller Institute was planned as a school in which to teach military surgeons the principles of and art of applying the Carrel-Dakin treatment.\"\nAfter he married the widow of Christian Herter in 1916, he worked in his private laboratory in Scarsdale, New York and had several close collaborations with other scientists. His main working fields were amino acids and enzymes. The extraction of amino acids from hydrolyzed peptides by butanol was invented by him. He also was interested in organic chemistry and synthesis, and devised the Dakin reaction and the Dakin\u2013West reaction.\nHe died shortly after the death of his wife in early 1952.", "hasanswer": true}]}

His hometown team optioned Essegian to Triple-A Spokane for six weeks before recalling him in early August.

The author thinks feminism should not act in opposition to men as individuals. To her, feminism is against oppressive and outdated social structures which forces both men and women into positions which are false and antagonistic. Thus, everyone has an important role to play in the feminist movement. It seems ironic that feminism has been characterized as anti-male, when in fact, it seeks to liberate men from the macho stereotypic roles men often have to endure such as the need to suppress feelings, act aggressively, and be deprived of contact with children. Sahoo thinks people should emphasize their femininity rather to impose the so-called stereotyped feministic attitude of the second wave.\nAs an Indian feminist, many of Sarojini Sahoo's writings deal candidly with female sexuality, the emotional lives of women, and the intricate fabric of human relationships, depicting extensively about the interior experiences of women and how their burgeoning sexuality is seen as a threat to traditional patriarchal societies; this book is rare of its kind and has covered the topics that never be discussed so far in any Indian discourse.

{"id": "69_640", "question": "Where was James Welling educated?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_68840", "text": "James IV was a true Renaissance prince and a patron of the arts, including many literary figures, most notably the Scots makars. Poets associated with his court include William Dunbar, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas. James patronised music at Restalrig using rental money from the King's Wark, and gave his backing to the foundation of King's College, Aberdeen, by his chancellor, William Elphinstone, and St Leonard's College, St Andrews, by his illegitimate son, Alexander, Archbishop of St Andrews, and John Hepburn, Prior of St Andrews. In 1496, partly at Elphinstone's instance, he also passed what has been described as Scotland's first education act, which introduced compulsory education at grammar school for the eldest sons and heirs of all barons and freeholders of substance.\nJames was both highly intelligent and well educated. In July 1498, Spanish ambassador, Pedro de Ayala, reported to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile: The King is 25 years and some months old. He is of noble stature, neither tall nor short, and as handsome in complexion and shape as a man can be. His address is very agreeable. He speaks the following foreign languages: Latin, very well; French, German, Flemish, Italian, and Spanish; Spanish as well as the Marquis, but he pronounces it more distinctly. He likes, very much, to receive Spanish letters. His own Scots language is as different from English as Aragonese from Castilian. The King speaks, besides, the language of the savages who live in some parts of Scotland and on the islands. It is as different from Scots as Biscayan is from Castilian. His knowledge of languages is wonderful. He is well read in the Bible and in some other devout books. He is a good historian. He has read many Latin and French histories, and profited by them, as he has a very good memory. He never cuts his hair or his beard. It becomes him very well.\nJames also ensured that the very best education was given to his illegitimate son, Alexander, who was tutored by Erasmus in Padua, Siena and Rome. James IV allegedly conducted a language deprivation experiment in which two children were sent to be raised by a mute woman alone on the island of Inchkeith, to determine if language was learned or innate.James IV had a wide range of intellectual interests, and took an interest in practical and scientific matters. He patronised the establishment of Scotland's first printing press, Chepman and Myllar Press, in 1507, and granted the Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers of Edinburgh a royal charter in 1506. James was also interested in dentistry, an interest which began in 1503 when the king summoned a 'barbour' to extract one of his teeth for the sum of 14 shillings. In 1504, he sought more practical experience of dentistry and purchased two gold toothpicks suspended from a chain, and \"ane turcase [pincer] to tak out teith\". It is recorded that James pulled two teeth from one of his own barber-surgeons, for which the king paid him 14 shillings, and also tried bloodletting on patients, and treating and dressing ulcer wounds. He also took an interest in other sciences which are now less creditable, establishing an alchemy workshop at Stirling Castle, where alchemist John Damian looked for ways to turn base metals into gold. The project consumed quantities of mercury, golden litharge, and tin. A goldsmith, Matthew Auchinleck, provided the alchemists with a still made of silver. Damian also researched aviation and undertook a failed experiment to fly from the battlements of Stirling Castle, an event which William Dunbar satirised in two separate poems.James poured large amounts of money into the construction or remodelling of several royal residences. He commissioned the construction between 1501 and 1505 of the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The impetus for the work probably came from his marriage to Margaret Tudor, which took place in Holyrood Abbey in August 1503. James also commissioned the construction of Falkland Palace in Fife between 1501 and 1513, on a site to the south of Falkland Castle. At Stirling Castle, James commissioned the construction of the great hall and a new royal lodging (the present-day King's Old Building), the remodelling of the chapel royal, and the reconstruction of the principal defences on the southern and eastern sides of the castle. He also commissioned the construction of the great hall at Edinburgh Castle, rebuilding at Linlithgow Palace, Rothesay Castle, and Dunbar Castle, and furnished his palaces with tapestries.\nThe first evidence of whisky production in Scotland comes from an entry in the Exchequer Rolls for 1494 where malt is sent \"To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae\", enough to make about 500 bottles. James IV reportedly had a great liking for whisky, and in 1506 the town of Dundee purchased a large amount of whisky from the Guild of Barber-Surgeons, which held the monopoly on production at the time.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Long tracking shots, including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme wide shots to create a sense of isolation.With The Fountain, Aronofsky restricted the use of computer-generated imagery. Henrik Fett, the visual effects supervisor of Look Effects, said, \"Darren was quite clear on what he wanted and his intent to greatly minimize the use of computer graphics ... and I think the results are outstanding.\" He used more subtle directing in The Wrestler and Black Swan, in which a less-visceral directing style better showcases the acting and narratives.

His father was of the Livonian nobility; his grandfather was a full general in the Imperial Russian Army. During the 1880s while at St. Petersburg University Oldenburg participated in the Scientific-Literary Association of Students, a brotherhood which shared liberal and radical ideals. Here he met Aleksandr Ulyanov as they were both in the inner circle of this organisation. Ulyanov dropped out of the inner circle when he started to plan an assassination attempt on the life of emperor Alexander III. The attempt failed, and following the execution of Ulyanov in 1887, his brother, Vladimir Lenin visited Oldenburg in Saint Petersburg in 1891. Oldenburg had just returned from a two-year trip to London, Paris, and Cambridge.\nOldenburg was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1900, and he served as its permanent Secretary from 1904 to 1929. From 1905 he became active in the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. In 1909\u201310 and 1914\u201315, he travelled in central Asia, where he discovered Sanskrit texts. He instigated scientific expeditions to Tibet and Dzungaria, which brought to light unique Buddhist manuscripts. To publish newly found manuscripts, in 1897 Oldenburg launched an authoritative edition of Buddhist texts, Bibliotheca Buddhica, which continues to this day.\nOldenburg joined the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in 1905; he served as a member of the State Council of Imperial Russia from 1912 to 1917. Following the February Revolution of 1917 he served in the Russian Provisional Government as Minister of Education. He set up the Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of the Population of the Borderlands of Russia at this time. Unlike his Kadet colleagues, he stayed in Russia after the October Revolution brought the Bolsheviks to power. Based on his acquaintance with Vladimir Lenin, he was able to develop an alliance between the Bolsheviks and Russian ethnographers, the former being more interested in nationalism amongst European peoples of the former Russian Empire, the ethnographers focusing more on the national question amongst its Asian peoples.Although he was briefly imprisoned by the Cheka in 1919, Oldenburg served as permanent secretary of the Academy of Sciences until 1929, when the Communist Party ousted hundreds of staff for resisting Bolshevization. Oldenburg devoted the remainder of his life to administrating the Soviet Institute of Oriental Studies, whose antecedent (the Asian Museum) he had directed since 1916.\nHe died on 28 February 1934 in St Petersburg. His son Sergei Sergeyevich Oldenburg wrote a biography of Tsar Nicholas II.

The \u201cTheaterkumpanei Ludwigshafen\u201d has produced a bilingual version of the play in an adaptation by B\u00e4rbel Maier; they perform it in German and Persian, both in Germany and Iran, at the Fadjr Festival, among others. At the 17th Hamedan Theater Festival ForChirldren&Adults 2010 it won several prices.\nSchreiber's book Ihr st\u00e4ndiger Begleiter (Her Constant Companion, subtitle: Fast eine Liebesgeschichte - Almost a Love Story) also draws on her personal history: It is the story of a young woman growing up in a strict and narrow-minded Christian community, as Schreiber did. The novel recounts the heroine's struggle to liberate herself from her pervading relationship with God, who constantly appears to her and with whom she converses familiarly. A Dutch translation of this book appeared in 2007.\nHer latest novel S\u00fc\u00df wie Schattenmorellen (Sweet as Morello Cherries) is a coming-of-age-story, most of it taking place in a cherry orchard.

He was the second consecutive Saskatchewan-born Governor-General. Hnatyshyn was sworn in during a ceremony in the Senate chamber on January 29, 1990.Hnatyshyn thereafter made an effort to open up Rideau Hall\u2014the monarch's and governor general's residence in Ottawa\u2014to the public, establishing a visitors' centre and initiating guided tours of the palace and the royal park in which it sits. These moves marked a complete reversal of the policies of his predecessor Sauv\u00e9, who had closed Rideau Hall to the general public. In 1991, Hnatyshyn staged on the grounds the first of the annual Governor General's Summer Concert Series and, the year after, mounted His Excellency's Most Excellent Rock Concert and re-opened the skating rink to the public.These events blended with some of Hnatyshyn's self-imposed mandates during his viceregal tenure, which included a desire to engage Canadian youth and focus attention on education and to encourage the arts. To these ends, he established in 1992 the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, the Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Voluntarism in the Arts, and the Governor General's Flight For Freedom Award for Lifetime Achievement in Literacy. Further, he founded the International Council for Canadian Studies, the Governor General Ramon John Hnatyshyn Education Fund, the Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Law, and the Governor General's International Award for Canadian Studies.Among numerous other official and ceremonial duties, the Governor General presided over celebrations to mark the 125th anniversary of Confederation and welcomed to Rideau Hall the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with a host of foreign dignitaries such as President of Russia Boris Yeltsin and King Hussein and Queen Noor of Jordan. Further, Hnatyshyn undertook a number of state visits, including one to Ukraine, before his time serving at Her Majesty's pleasure ended on February 6, 1995.\nThroughout his tenure as the Canadian viceroy, Hnatyshyn was both defended and criticised by the Monarchist League of Canada. In their final summary of Hnatyshyn's years in office, though, the former governor general was generally viewed to have not stood up for the Canadian Crown that he represented, choosing to follow, instead of Vincent Massey's example, that of Sauv\u00e9, who was herself seen as a republican. This lack of loyalty, it was argued, left Hnatyshyn with few defenders when he was targeted by members of the Reform Party for his salary and taxes. It was thought by John Pepall that Hnatyshyn's name had been selected by Mulroney to put forward to the Queen for appointment as governor general because Hnatyshyn, who had just recently been a member of the Cabinet headed by Mulroney until losing his parliamentary seat in the 1988 election, was someone Mulroney could \"hardly feel any deference for\", allowing Mulroney to continue to show the \"juvenile extreme of the politician's craving for publicity and centre stage\" he had while Jeanne Sauv\u00e9 was governor general.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to research [1] published by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Gompert was educated at Adelphi Academy,\nPratt Institute, and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. The Landmarks Commission report on Gompert was included in its study of its decision to grant landmark status to the building that once housed The High School of Music & Art. It states:\n\"After employment in the firms of McKim, Mead & White, Maynicke & Franke, and George Edward Harding & Gooch, he established his own practice around 1906 and specialized in the design of commercial and institutional buildings. He was elected president of the Brooklyn chapter of the\nAmerican Institute of Architects in 1923. Gompert was hired in February 1923 by the New York City Board of Education as an expert to assist in the reorganization of the Bureau of Construction and Maintenance and to facilitate the construction of public schools; his initial six-month contract gave him the 'powers and duties of Superintendent of School Buildings.'\n\"According to The New York Times, Gompert had 'much experience in the directing of large building construction enterprises.' After a six-month extension of his contract, Gompert was appointed in January 1924 to the position of Architect and Superintendent of School Buildings for the Board of Education, and became the third-highest paid official in the administration of Mayor John Francis Hylan.\n\"Gompert was the first successor to the noted Charles B.J. Snyder, Superintendent of School Buildings from 1891 until January 1, 1923, who had been responsible for the vast school construction program following the consolidation of New York City in 1898, and had been 'virtually forced out of the post under pressure by. . . Mayor Hylan.'\n\"To alleviate the serious overcrowding in the schools caused by immigration after World War I,\nNew York City undertook another extensive program of school construction in the mid-1920s. Gompert was forced to contend with a significant shortage of bricklayers in the citywide building industry, as well as a lack of interest on the part of major construction firms in bidding on public\nschool construction projects. He attempted to bring about economy and change in the process of school construction, including standardizing design and construction, employing general contracts instead of individual construction contracts, and instituting double shifts to shorten construction time. In 1925, however, charges began to surface, first by a mayoral candidate, that many of the schools constructed under Gompert were defective. By the end of 1927, three separate investigations were underway and Gompert resigned in December. Former Mayor Hylan responded to critics that\nGompert was under attack because he had 'built too many schools to suit those that do not want the\nchildren educated.'\n\"The Board of Education's Joint Committee of Architects and Engineers issued\nits report in 1928 and called Gompert's schools 'in general honest, safe, efficient and appropriate to the purpose.'\n\"In his nearly five years as school architect,Gompert was credited with overseeing the design\nand construction of some 170 new schools and\nadditions, including The High School of Music & Art (in 1924), DeWitt Clinton High School and Theodore Roosevelt High School (1929), the Bronx; James Madison High School (1926), Brooklyn; and\nJamaica High School (1927) and Far Rockaway High School (1929), Queens, in austere versions of\nsuch contemporary institutional styles as Collegiate Gothic, Georgian, and Spanish Colonial.

He was educated at Repton School, before matriculating to Trinity College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, Fry played first-class cricket for Oxford University Cricket Club, making his debut for the club against Yorkshire at Oxford in 1959. He scored 576 runs at an average of 26.18 in debut season, including a maiden century against the Free Foresters, sharing an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 256 with Abbas Ali Baig which remained a first-class record for the fifth wicket for Oxford until 2017, when it was broken by Dan Escott's and Matthew Naylor's partnership of 267. He gained his blue in this season, when he played against Cambridge University in The University Match at Lord's. The Oxford side of 1959 was considered the last great Oxford University side, with E. W. Swanton proffering that it was good enough to finish in the top half of the County Championship.The following season, Fry made fifteen first-class appearances for Oxford in 1960 and made his second appearance in The University Match, which gained him his second blue. In his season, he scored 642 runs for Oxford and made his second century. Later in the season, he made five first-class appearances for Hampshire in the County Championship, scoring 134 runs with a highest score of 38. Against Sussex at Bournemouth, he was notably bowled by Robin Marlar, who would later become one of his successors to the presidency of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He followed in the footsteps of both his father and grandfather, C. B. Fry in playing for Hampshire.

In his final year, he made his third appearance in The University Match and thus, gained his third blue. 41 of his 50 first-class appearances came for Oxford, with him scoring 1,576 runs for the university at an average of 24.24. The following season, having graduated from Oxford, he appeared twice for Northamptonshire against Cambridge University at Northampton, and Essex in the County Championship at Colchester. He later appeared twice for the Free Foresters in first-class cricket, against Oxford University in 1964 and 1968. Fry has had a long association with the MCC, succeeding Sir Tim Rice as its president in 2003. His tenure was not without controversy, with critics in the MCC claiming he ran club affairs akin to a dictator. At the end of his twelve-month presidency, he was succeeded by Tom Graveney, who was the first ex-professional to hold the post.

He was reelected for a five-year term (2004\u20132009) in May 2004. He was the youngest citizen ever elected to the mayor's office. He was elected unanimously as the first president of the National Mayor's Association of Panama (2001) and reelected twice for the same position (2003, 2005). Navarro also served as co-president of the Uni\u00f3n de Ciudades Capitales de Iberoamericanas (UCCI) together with Mayor Alvarez del Manzano of Madrid, Spain (2002).\nHe quickly established himself as a national party leader and in August 2002 was elected to the nine-member National Executive Committee, the PRD's top governing organism. In 2008 he was re-elected into the National Executive Committee as the most voted member. In September 2008, he participated in his party's primaries for president against the then housing minister, Balbina Herrera. He was defeated by 4%, thus losing an election for the first time in his political career. Even though he had lost the primaries, he had almost half the party supporting his candidacy and this led Balbina Herrera to nominate him as vice-presidential candidate in the PRD ticket for the 2009 presidential election. In that election the PRD and Balbina Herrera lost to Ricardo Martinelli and Juan Carlos Varela by a wide margin. This led Juan Carlos Navarro to call for all the National Executive Committee members to resign based on the poor election results. In October 2009, Juan Carlos Navarro resigned his post as First Under Secretary in the National Executive Committee and shortly thereafter all other members resigned, including Balbina Herrera and then Secretary-General Martin Torrijos.\nIn 2012, Juan Carlos Navarro was elected Secretary-General of the PRD, the top post in the party's structure.

In March 2013 he participated once again in his party's primaries for president against 17 other candidates and won with over 95% of the vote. In the 2014 presidential elections, he came third with 28% of the vote.Even though Navarro lost the election, the party won a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. For this reason, after the election Navarro negotiated a legislative pact called \"Panama Primero\" with president-elect Juan Carlos Varela to secure that many of the projects proposed during his campaign would become a reality. These proposals include the Minister for Environmental Issues and a complete decentralization of the government. Once the legislative pact was finalized, Navarro resigned his post as Secretary General of the PRD accepting his responsibility for the election results.\nOn July 10, 2018, Navarro once again registered to participate in the PRD primaries, which were to be held on September 16 of the same year.

Hardy Cross Dillard was also cousin of civil engineer Hardy Cross \u2013 originator of the Hardy Cross method.Dillard attended the Virginia Episcopal School and later the U.S. Military Academy  where he graduated in 1924. Upon graduation, Dillard was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Infantry. However, with the First World War fading in to the background, fresh West Point graduates were encouraged to leave the service. Thus, like many of his classmates, Dillard resigned his commission two months after graduation. He subsequently entered the University of Virginia Law School and served on the editorial board of the Virginia Law Review and was also president of the law school student body. Due to his legal ability, the law faculty took the unusual step of asking him to stay after graduation to serve as an instructor. He taught primarily international law for two years before leaving to become an associate in the New York City law firm of Gregg & Church. After only a year with the law firm,  he was awarded a fellowship by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to study international law at the University of Paris.Upon completion of the program, Dillard accepted an appointment as assistant professor of law at the University of Virginia. He returned to New York City in the summers of 1932 and 1933 and worked as an associate at Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Gardiner and Reed. In 1934 he became the university's director of Institute of Public Affairs \u2013 an assignment in addition to his law duties. The institute brought prominent speakers to the university from government, business and academia to discuss topics of national and international interest. As the director, Dillard became acquainted with some of the leading figures of the day such as Senator Robert A. Taft, Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, Ambassador Paul V McNutt, Owen Lattimore, Thurman Arnold, Max Lerner, David Sarnoff, Rexford Guy Tugwell, Major George Fielding Eliot, Max Eastman, Quincy Howe, and William L. Shirer. Dillard, however, drew controversy by inviting communists such as Earl Browder to speak. A former president of the university's Alumni Association protested in a letter to the Alumni News that Dillard went \"beyond freedom of speech\" when he offered a rostrum from which the general secretary of the American Communist Party and the Soviet Ambassador could, \"spread subversive doctrines.\" Dillard responded that where controversial topics are selected, \"both sides should be fairly heard.\" A spokesman for Germany was also invited to speak.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was the second son of Robert Caesar Childers, a translator and oriental scholar from an ecclesiastical family, and Anna Mary Henrietta Barton, from an Anglo-Irish landowning family of Glendalough House, Annamoe, County Wicklow, with interests in France such as the winery that bears their name. When Erskine was six, his father died from tuberculosis and his mother, although at that stage showing no signs of the disease, was confined to an isolation hospital to safeguard her children. She corresponded regularly with Childers until she died from tuberculosis, without having seen her children again, six years later. The five children were sent to the Bartons, the family of their mother's uncle, at Glendalough. Well-treated by his new family, Childers grew up with a strong affection for, and knowledge of, Ireland, albeit, at that point in time, from the comfortable viewpoint of the \"Protestant Ascendancy\". According to his biographer Michael Hopkinson, it was the personal tension caused by his innate belief in English superiority, in conflict with this new respect for Ireland, which later caused his remarkable conversion to \"hard-line Irish republicanism\".He was educated at home by tutors (with his brother Henry and cousin Robert Barton) until the age of ten, when he became a boarder at a preparatory school in England, returning to Glendalough for the holidays. At the recommendation of his grandfather, Canon Charles Childers, in 1883 he was sent to the Haileybury and Imperial Service College. His performance there was initially described as \"middling\" but he later won school prizes in Latin and in his final year he was made \"head of house\". There he won an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied the classical tripos and then law. He distinguished himself as the editor of Cambridge Review, the university magazine. Notwithstanding his unattractive voice and poor debating skills, he became president of the Trinity College Debating Society (known as the \"Magpie and Stump\"). Although Childers was an admirer of his cousin Hugh Childers, a member of the British Cabinet who had supported the first Irish home rule bill, he spoke vehemently against the policy in college debates, warning that \"[Irish] national aspirations were incompatible with our own safety.\". A sciatic injury sustained while hillwalking in the summer before he went up, which persisted for the rest of his life, left him slightly lame and he was unable to pursue his intention of earning a rugby blue, but he became a proficient rower.Having stayed an extra year at Cambridge to gain a further degree (in law) Childers briefly entered legal chambers in London as a pupil, the first stage in becoming a barrister. After four months, influenced by his cousin Hugh Childers, he resigned his pupillage and enrolled at a crammer to prepare for the competitive entry examination to become a parliamentary official. He was successful and, early in 1895, he became a junior committee clerk in the House of Commons, with responsibility for preparing formal and legally sound bills from the proposals of the government of the day.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He became an advocate for the evolutionary biological approach after being one of the few to listen to the ideas of Robert Trivers, who was shunned due to his mental illness. Several years into this new way of looking at animal and human behavior, DeVore was asked whether the data were really supporting it. He liked to say, \"The data are sitting up and begging.\" By the turn of the millennium sociobiology and evolutionary psychology had become normal science, although still controversial. One of the painful consequences for DeVore in the '80s and '90s was that his mentor and close friend, \"Sherry\" Washburn, was a bitter opponent of the new approach. They eventually reconciled, but never agreed.\nDeVore had a sometimes caustic but compelling personality and intellect that worked their influence in and out of the classroom. He appeared on many television programs as an expert or narrator. He played an instrumental role in developing supplementary school curricula, one of which, \"Man: A Course of Study\" (MACOS) became a subject of Congressional debate because of its emphasis on evolution. The son of an itinerant Methodist preacher in East Texas, DeVore had sold Bibles door-to-door for a time as a very young man, but when he became convinced of the validity of Darwin's theory, he taught and defended it with what many said was a compelling art of persuasion.\nHe suggested that, due to sexual selection, \"Males are basically a breeding experiment run by females\" and that \"Males are the safest, most consistent way to contribute variation to the system...\"Irven DeVore once said that \"There is no excuse for boring students when you're talking about human nature. It's too interesting.\" He taught in large lecture halls that were perennially full as well as in the smaller but influential \"Simian Seminar,\" which met in his living room on Wednesday evenings, in his rambling, comfortable home on a quiet wooded street in Cambridge. Leading or rising figures in the fields he was interested in came to address the seminar, which was a center of intellectual ferment in those fields for decades.\nThrough these seminars, the ideas of evolutionary biology rose to prominence as group selection (with regard to explaining behaviour) faded, albeit not directly through Irven's work. Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, two attendees of the seminars, stated \"DeVore's intellectual impact is less well known because his ideas were realized through his students and colleagues.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Built in Belfast, Ireland, in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, RMS Titanic was the second of the three Olympic-class ocean liners\u2014the lead vessel was RMS Olympic and the final ship in the class was HMHS Britannic.  They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line's fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912. The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, and the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM).\nWhite Star faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals, Cunard Line\u2014which, with the aid of the Royal Navy, had recently launched the twin sister ships Lusitania and Mauretania, the fastest passenger ships then in service\u2014and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before, as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury. White Star sought an upgrade of its fleet primarily to respond to the introduction of the Cunard giants but also to considerably strengthen its position on the Southampton\u2013Cherbourg\u2013New York service that had been inaugurated in 1907. The new ships would have sufficient speed to maintain a weekly service with only three ships instead of the original four. Thus, Olympic and Titanic would replace RMS Teutonic of 1889, RMS Majestic of 1890 as well as RMS Adriatic of 1907. RMS Oceanic made her first departure from her new homeport in June 1907. Her running mates on the Southampton-New York run were the Teutonic, Majestic, and the new Adriatic. Majestic resumed her old position on the White Star Line's New York service after the loss of Titanic.The ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilder Harland & Wolff, which had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867. Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for Wilhelm Wolff to sketch a general concept, which Edward James Harland would turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were a relatively low priority; Harland & Wolff were authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin. In the case of the Olympic-class ships, a cost of \u00a33 million (approximately \u00a3310 million in 2019) for the first two ships was agreed plus \"extras to contract\" and the usual five per cent fee.Harland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing Olympic-class vessels. The design was overseen by Lord Pirrie, a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews's deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager.

Within 3 months she was in Delano, California, working for Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers (UFW).

In 1972 Loesch became one of the founding members of the Pax (Peace) Center in Erie, Pennsylvania, joining Sr. Mary Lou Kownacki, OSB, in forming a Catholic feminist peace community. This group, comprising Benedictine Sisters and lay associates, was organized more or less on the Catholic Worker model, combining activism with the Works of Mercy (soup kitchen, homeless shelter work. etc.) The Pax Center, together with other Catholic antiwar activist groups, soon morphed into Pax Christi USA, the American affiliate of Pax Christi, an international Catholic peace movement.\nIn the late 1970s, Loesch became an activist associated with the \"Mobilization for Survival\", a coalition which opposed nuclear weapons. She became convinced that abortion and the nuclear arms race were moral equivalents, and advocated partnership between the peace and anti-abortion movements.

He was born at Nuremberg, and died at Weimar.\nHe studied philology, especially Oriental, and philosophy at Altdorf from 1664 to 1669, in which year he went to Jena and became a disciple of the celebrated Johannes Mus\u00e4us, the representative of the middle party in the Syncretistic Controversy, whose daughter he married in 1674. Taking his doctor\u2019s degree the same year, in 1675 he became professor of church history at the university, and lectured with great success on several different branches of theology.\nIn 1682 he was chosen to represent the Protestant side in the negotiations with the papal legate Nicolas Steno, bishop of Titiopolis, for reunion of the Churches. He was three times rector at Jena before he was called by the elector Frederick III, in 1694, as professor and provisional rector to the new university of Halle. Here his devotion to strict orthodoxy brought him into conflict with some of his colleagues, and the pietistic movement also gave him trouble, so that after a year he was glad to accept the combined positions of chief court preacher,  superintendent, and pastor at Weimar \u2014 which, however, he held only a few months until his death.\nHe left a name in the history of theology, especially by his dogmatic compendium, which still preserves the early Protestant traditions among High Lutherans, especially in America. The Jena theologians, and Johannes Musaeus in particular, had been asked by Ernest the Pious to draw up such a work, to take the place of the antiquated Hutter, and Mus\u00e6us urged his son-in-law to do it. The first edition appeared in 1686, the second, enlarged, in 1691, and it has been frequently reprinted since. It was commended for general use as a textbook by its method, its conciseness, and its absence of mere polemics. It was obviously, however, intended by its author as a vindication of the Jena theology, which had been sharply attacked from Wittenberg, and lay under some suspicion of syncretism. Its dependence upon Mus\u00e6us is really the distinguishing feature of the book, which is largely a compilation from him. Baier\u2019s other works include polemical writings against Erbermann, a convert to Roman Catholicism and a Jesuit, and against the Quakers; and three other\ncompendiums, published after his death (1698), one of exegetical, and one of moral theology, as well as one of the history of dogma.

She was instrumental in the creation of the Canaveral National Seashore in 1975, and the Spruce Creek Preserve, renamed the Doris Leeper Spruce Creek Preserve in memoriam. She founded the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1982. She was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 1999.\nLeeper was born on April 4, 1929, in Charlotte, North Carolina. She attended Duke University, originally intending to become a brain surgeon \u2013 the origin of her nickname \"Doc.\" She eventually graduated in 1951 with a degree in art history.In 1958, while working in the field of commercial art, she moved to the small isolated community of Eldora, Florida, situated on a barrier island between New Smyrna Beach and Titusville, Florida, along Mosquito Lagoon. As a result of her presence there, Leeper became increasingly interested in environmental preservation. By 1961, she had become a full-time artist, specializing in painting and sculpture. Her work is in over 100 collections in the U.S. and abroad.By the early 1970s, Leeper was a well-known figure in the Florida environmental movement, as an advocate for protection of Mosquito Lagoon and opposition to major development on the barrier island around Eldora. She used her growing influence to advocate for the 1975 creation of the Canaveral National Seashore (CANA), which encompassed 58,000 acres including the barrier island and Mosquito Lagoon.  Rep. Lou Frey, one of the sponsors of the Congressional authorization called Leeper \"the driving force behind the establishment of Canaveral National Seashore.\" Afterwards she was appointed to the Canaveral National Seashore Advisory Commission and founded Friends of Canaveral where she pushed for wilderness protection for the seashore.Leeper conceived of the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1977, envisioning it as a Florida artist-in-residence program in which artists of all disciplines could work with current prominent artists in a supportive and creative environment. Leeper saw the potential for an artist's residency as a place for ideas to be created, shared, and come into fruition. She soon persuaded friends and community members to join in her vision. In 1979, she convinced the Rockefeller Foundation to provide a challenge grant that soon was matched. This $25,000 in seed money was the unofficial inception of the ACA. When a prime piece of property became available on the shores of Turnbull Bay, a tidal estuary west of New Smyrna Beach, Leeper raised the $50,000 necessary to buy the ten-acre plot. Three years later, five main buildings were completed. Over the years, five more buildings were constructed and an additional 59 acres were purchased as preserve land.\nThe ACA officially opened in 1982 for the first residency with author James Dickey, sculptor Duane Hanson, and composer David Del Tredici. Since then, over 155 interdisciplinary residencies have taken place, featuring over 430 Master Artists and over 3,500 Associate Artists from around the world.\nBeginning in 1987, Leeper pushed for conservation of lands adjacent to ACA on Turnbull Bay and Spruce Creek. She founded Friends of Spruce Creek Preserve, and actively engaged in the protection of over 2,000 acres of scrub, wetlands, and archaeological sites, now known as Doris Leeper Spruce Creek Preserve.Leeper was awarded honorary doctorates from Duke and from Stetson University. She was named Florida ambassador of the arts, and inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 1999.  A 45-year retrospective of her work was held at Cornell Fine Arts Museum in 1995.When Canaveral National Seashore was established, the National Park Service bought out all of the private property owners in Eldora including Leeper who retained a life estate in her property.  On her death on April 11, 2000, her property, as with the rest of Eldora, formally became part of the national seashore.  Now, only two of its original buildings remain. In 2020, Leeper's house, known as Caper's Acres, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in recognition of her national reputation as an artist and environmental advocate.", "hasanswer": true}]}
