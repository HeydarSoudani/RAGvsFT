In the 1920s, the product was modified into the menstrual pad Kotex. A further modification of the original crepe paper made it thinner and softer, and the resultant 1924 product was called \"Kleenex\" and marketed as a cold cream remover.   In line with the company's requirements for their brand names to be short, easy to say, and easy to explain, the name Kleenex was selected as the \"Kleen\" portion of the name denotes its cleansing purpose. The \"ex\" was added to show that Kleenex was of the family of products that included Kotex. This was the first marketing of a disposable paper-based facial tissue in the western world, and was sold as a substitute for face towels or cotton wool. In 1925, the first Kleenex tissue ad was used in magazines showing \"the new secret of keeping a pretty skin as used by famous movie stars\". A few years after the introduction of Kleenex, the Cellucotton's head researcher tried to persuade the head of advertising to try to market the tissue for colds and hay fever. The administrator declined the idea but then committed a small amount of ad space to mention of using Kleenex tissue as a handkerchief. By the 1930s, Kleenex was being marketed with the slogan \"Don't Carry a Cold in Your Pocket\" and its use as a disposable handkerchief replacement became predominant. In 1943, Kleenex began licensing the Little Lulu cartoon character to popularize the brand.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Cadillac began its campaign to promote the Escalade on August 14, 2013, and started posting teasers online on September 23, 2013, with help from the photographer Autumn de Wilde, who helped reveal more images ahead of the unveiling. A YouTube page called \"Escalade Reveal\" was set up to showcase the videos along with the countdown to the unveiling. On November 25, 2013, Cadillac began spreading the word of mouth about the 2015 Escalade by placing a front facsimile cutout of the vehicle on display at Saks Fifth Avenue's New York City flagship store during its annual Christmas promotional campaign, which shows the SUV being frozen in wraps.Production on the 2015 Escalade began in January 2014 at GM's Arlington, Texas, assembly plant and went on sale in April 2014 as a 2015 model (with the MSRP starting at around $71,000 for standard-length, $74,000 for ESV), and available in only three trims: Base, Luxury, and Premium. International sales were scheduled to start in the summer of 2014. They are assigned to the GMT K2XX platform as K2XL. \"The 2015 Escalade exterior light signature draws inspiration from a variety of sources, beginning with Cadillac\u2019s heritage of vertical exterior lamps and extending into architecture,\" said Exterior Lighting Design Manager Martin Davis.The Escalade was planned to switch to the unibody Lambda platform but was quickly nixed because of customer aversion. According to a report on Autoblog.com, GM had reissued a redesign on the GM full-size SUV lineup, including the Escalade, for a 2014 release in response to increased SUV sales, and was working on its full-size SUV replacements, which would see a possible change in the Escalade's SUV platform. But in July 2013, a series of spy shots revealed that GM would keep the Escalade a body-on-frame SUV. However, GM is looking at expanding the Escalade brand to the large CUV segment, which would see a vehicle using the Escalade badge sharing the same platform as the Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia, which is in the planning stages. According to VP Bob Ferguson, Cadillac's first three-row Escalade CUV could be introduced in 2016. There is also a possibility that GM might export the Escalade to Australia as a right-hand drive vehicle as part of Cadillac's global expansion, as GM has begun to import its North American vehicles to its Holden division there after discontinuing the latter's locally produced models in 2017.The cargo space was reduced from 109.8 in (2,789 mm) to 94.2 in (2,393 mm) on the standard model and from 137.5 in (3,492 mm) to 120.5 in (3,061 mm) on the ESV in order to allow an additional 1.7 inches of headroom and 45.3 inches of legroom in the front while reducing the third-row legroom space from 25.6 in (650 mm) to 24.8 in (630 mm). GM's 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8, good for 420 horsepower and 460 pound-feet of torque, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission (2015i models and beyond are 8-Speed Automatics), is the only engine offered, along with a new coil-over front suspension and five-link rear setup, a wider track, variable-assist electric power steering and Cadillac's Magnetic Ride Control system with Tour and Sport modes. The interior now has a hand-crafted design that features cut-and-sewn and wrapped materials, with wood trim options. The dashboard was also updated, and the Cadillac CUE system is added as a standard feature, along with an updated security system.\nThe 2015 Escalade lineup received an 8-speed transmission, surround view camera, and 4G LTE connectivity as part of a mid-year refresh, which also saw the wreaths on the grille disappear from the Escalade as part of Cadillac's plans to update the logo to emphasize the crest on all of its models.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was the standard Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm \"Telegraphist Air Gunner\" machine gun, on British built carrier (Torpedo Strike Reconnaissance) aircraft - the Fairey Swordfish, the Fairey Albacore and the Fairey Barracuda. As supplies of air-cooled .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns increased the Vickers G.O. was phased out of use with the RAF. These machine guns were then reallocated from RAF stocks to units of the British and Commonwealth armies. The gun continued in service with the Fleet Air Arm and its last recorded use by the navy was by 812 Squadron RNAS Barracudas in anti piracy patrols off Hong Kong in October 1945.\nThe Long Range Desert Group was supplied with large numbers of the Vickers G.O. for use on its vehicles. They were used in single or custom built twin mountings. The Special Air Service adopted it for their hit and run tactics, mounting it in pairs on their jeeps. Over the years, it was assumed by some that the latter services took the phased-out VGO because they could obtain no other suitable machine guns but with its high rate of fire and low-friction locking design (which proved resistant to jams from sand), the LRDG and SAS found the G.O. markedly superior to either the .303 in (7.7 mm) water-cooled Vickers or the Bren gun. In a similar manner, the Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron of the Reconnaissance Corps mounted the VGO on jeeps when they were attached to the 1st Airborne Division during Operation Market-Garden in September 1944. Royal Marine and Army Commandos used the VGO for infantry support/squad automatic weapon briefly around D-Day. \nIn the Coastal Forces of the Royal Navy, the Vickers K began to replace the Lewis gun on board Motor Torpedo Boats, Motor Launches and other light craft, from 1942.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "176_32", "question": "Which company is GWR 7  Class produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_57704", "text": "The class originated from the four earlier Class D 0-8-0 tender locomotives. These were purchased from Sharp, Stewart and Company, who had originally built them for the Swedish & Norwegian Railway. One appealing feature the class had were their short overall length, due to their small four-wheeled tenders. This made them unusually short for their power, suitable for the Barry Railway's restrictively short turntables, and their limited range was not an issue for the short journeys of the Welsh mineral traffic.When the Barry Railway needed more locomotives for coal trains on the Vale of Glamorgan Line, it returned to Sharp Stewart (who had also supplied most of the locos on the railway) for similar engines to the Class D. The result was the Class H 0-8-2T, which had the same small driving wheels to give a high tractive effort, and were heavy (for the time) giving good braking. They were built as tank locomotives with an additional rear pony truck that allowed a greater coal and water capacity than that of the small Class D tender, whilst also being shorter and not requiring the use of turntables. Seven locomotives were delivered in 1896, and numbered 79\u201385, the numbers being carried on an oval plate attached to the side tanks. Once delivered, however, the Class H locos were employed in hauling heavy coal trains between Barry Docks and the large yard at Cadoxton, with this task being their main duty in service.\nWith the grouping in 1922, the Barry Railway became part of the Great Western Railway, which renumbered the locos 1380\u20131386, placing the new numbers on the bunker behind the cab door, and designating them 1380 class in the GWR records. Improvements were made to numbers 1380 and 1383 at Swindon Works, including GWR pattern safety bonnets, enlarged bunkers, new buffers and an extended smokebox. These changes added an extra ton to their total weight. At the same time the boiler pressure on these two locos was raised by 10 psi (69 kPa), with the tractive effort also being increased appropriately. Despite this the class were non-standard in GWR terms, and were all scrapped between 1925 and 1930.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was founded on 24 June 1910 in Milan, Italy, as A.L.F.A., an acronym for Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili. The brand is known for sport-oriented vehicles and has been involved in car racing since 1911. As of 2023 it is a subsidiary of the multinational automotive manufacturing corporation Stellantis.\nAlfa Romeo began with the purchase of the main factory building of French carmaker Darracq in Milan, which was closing up and selling all its assets. Its first car was the 1910 24 HP, designed by Giuseppe Merosi. Alfa ventured into motor racing, with drivers Franchini and Ronzoni competing in the 1911 Targa Florio with two 24-hp models. In August 1915, the company came under the direction of Neapolitan entrepreneur Nicola Romeo, who converted the factory to produce military hardware for the Italian and Allied war efforts. In 1920, the name of the company was changed to Alfa Romeo with the Torpedo 20\u201330 HP the first car to be so badged.\nIn 1921, the Banca Italiana di Sconto, which backed the Ing. Nicola Romeo & Co., went bankrupt, and the government needed to support the industrial companies involved, of which Alfa Romeo was among, through the \"Consorzio per Sovvenzioni sui Valori Industriali\". In 1925, the railway activities were separated from the Romeo company, and in 1928 Nicola Romeo left. In 1933, the state ownership was reorganized under the banner of the Italian state industrial organization Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI), which then had effective control. The company struggled to return to profitability after World War II and turned to mass-producing small vehicles rather than hand-building luxury models. In 1954, it developed the Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine, which would remain in production until 1994. The Istituto per la Ricostruzione (IRI), the state conglomerate that controls Finmeccanica, sold the marque to the Fiat Group in 1986 due to the marque being unprofitable.Alfa Romeo has competed successfully in Grand Prix motor racing, Formula One, sportscar racing, touring car racing, and rallies. It has competed both as a constructor and an engine supplier, via works entries (usually under the name Alfa Corse or Autodelta), and private entries. The first racing car was made in 1913, three years after the foundation of the company, and Alfa Romeo won the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925. The race victories gave a sporty image to the marque, and Enzo Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari racing team in 1929 as an Alfa Romeo racing team, before becoming independent in 1939.

The L-59's most numerous operator, and its first export customer, was the Egyptian Air Force; a total of 69 L-59E aircraft would be delivered to the service. Early Egyptian operations encountered poor engine reliability; this matter let to a contract to the American aerospace firm AlliedSignal to produce an improved digital engine control system. The type had reportedly been intended for use as a lead-in-fighter trainer for the service's General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and Dassault Mirage 2000 fleets, and were equipped to be armed with Eastern-supplied weaponry. However, the Egyptian Air Force L-59s saw little use, allegedly being placed into storage around 1999.During the early to mid 1990s, various export opportunities were pursued by Aero Vodochody for the L-59, complimenting its continued sales efforts with the L-39 predecessor. One opportunity pursued was the Royal Australian Air Force's lead-in fighter-trainer requirement, an effort which would ultimately be unsuccessful. There were also proposed variants, such as the L-59F, that were to be provisioned with equipment from overseas suppliers, such as avionics from the Israeli company Elbit, and adoption of the American-Taiwanese Honeywell/ITEC F124 turbofan engine in place of the Lotarev DV-2 of earlier variants.In 1995, deliveries of L-59Ts commenced to the Tunisian Air Force, a total of 12 were delivered to the service. The type has been typically used for advanced pilot training and weapons training purposes, with a secondary focus on conducting light combat operations as well. During the First Libyan Civil War in 2011, Tunisian L-59s commonly flew armed patrol missions along the country's border with Libya. During April 2014, a number of Tunisian L-59s performed multiple reconnaissance missions and counter-insurgency (COIN) strikes in support of major military offensives in the border region of Mount Chaambi against Ansar al-Sharia and al-Qaeda-linked militants that aimed to destabilize Tunisia's transition to democracy.

This generation was only a five-seat (two-row) SUV. Fearing the growing hegemony of the Lincoln Navigator, the Escalade was rushed through the design process to reach dealers quickly. Essentially little more than a badge-engineered GMC Yukon Denali, the SUV's aesthetics were similar to the Denali and the final vehicle was smaller than the Navigator. The Escalade's underpinnings were borrowed from the Yukon Denali line, with the GMC logos on the center caps replaced with Cadillac's crest. The Escalade also used the same 5.7L Vortec 5700 V8 at 255 hp (190 kW) as found in all other GMT400-based models, which was underpowered compared to the Navigator's 300 hp (224 kW) and 365 lb\u22c5ft (495 N\u22c5m) 5.4L InTech V8.

The GMC Yukon Denali was heavily differentiated from the standard Yukon models with a unique front hood, fenders, grille, headlamps, and bumper cover, color-keyed mirrors and door handles, a unique paint-matched roof rack and running boards, and lower paint-matched cladding all around with embossed emblems. The only exterior differences for the Cadillac Escalade (other than badging) were a slightly different grille treatment and smooth cladding with emblems placed on the sheet metal. The interior design, however, would differ significantly between the two models. Denali already added unique two-tone seats, genuine zebrano wood trim on the front-window switch panels and unique center console, chromed interior door handles, \"Yukon Denali\" embroidery on the door panels, a color keyed steering wheel, and a unique instrument cluster versus the standard Yukon. Escalade would add additional real wood trim on all four door panels and steering wheel, imitation wood on the instrument panel, and \"Cadillac\" script on the console veneer, a color-keyed steering column, leather-wrapped column shifter, and unique front and rear seats with perforated leather, a Cadillac crest embroidered on the headrests, and a storage compartment in the rear seat armrest.Both vehicles included a generous amount of standard equipment not available on other GM full-size SUVs, including 16-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels, a Bose Acoustimass seven-speaker stereo (including subwoofer), an in-dash CD player and console-mounted six-CD changer, auto-dimming exterior and rearview mirrors with compass and temperature display, automatic headlamps with daytime running lights, front projector fog lamps, heated front and rear seats, rear-seat audio controls, a BCM (body control module) providing functions such as retained accessory power and interior illumination fade-off, a unique warning chime, a special coating used on the dashboard for a more premium appearance, front and rear Bilstein shock absorbers, and unique engine and transmission tuning for a more refined driving experience. An OnStar in-vehicle telematics and communications system was optional on the Denali but standard on the Escalade, with the only other option for both models being a choice between twin rear barn doors or a split tailgate with rear-window wiper. A dealer-installed cellular telephone was also available with factory provisions in the center console.Colors available on the Escalade were Silver Sand Metallic, Sable Black, Aspen White, and Bordeaux Red Metallic.

Evidence of this era in the Ohio Valley is found in the area's large burial and ceremonial mounds and petroglyphs including the Leo Petroglyph.Tribes that inhabited the area in the Colonial period included with Mingo, Lenape, and Shawnee. Westward expansion by American pioneers displaced the Indigenous People who were killed in wars or relocated to the Great Plains and placed on reservations following the passage of the Indian Removal Act. The pioneer settlers cleared the land for farming and developed industries around which towns and cities grew.Iron ore was discovered in southern Ohio in the mid-19th century. The combination of deposits of ore and vast stands of old-growth forests made the Hanging Rock Iron Region ideally suited for the iron industry. The Jefferson Iron Furnace was constructed in 1854. It met the growing demand for iron in the developing United States of America. The importance of the furnaces in the Hanging Rock region grew tremendously during the American Civil War. Iron produced in Jackson County was sold to manufacturers under the trademark, \"Anchor\". This iron was used to build the USS Monitor, an ironclad warship made famous by its contest against the CSS Virginia, a Confederate ironclad sometimes known as the Merrimack, at the Battle of Hampton Roads.The era of iron production in Jackson County began to wane in the years following the Civil War. Demand for iron outstripped the resources in the Hanging Rock Iron Region. Ore deposits had been cleared and what remained was minimal and difficult to extract. Also much of the forested land had been cleared to provide charcoal to fire the furnaces. A combination of a lack of ore and charcoal helped bring about the end of the iron era. Remnants of the Jefferson Iron Furnaces are found in Jackson Lake State Park.Other industries that were in the area included coal mining and salt mining. Over a million tons of coal were mined in 1888. Jackson County was the second leading coal producing county in the state during the coal mining era.

Several aviation companies investigated a response to C1, including French aircraft manufacturer Dewoitine, headed by \u00c9mile Dewoitine. Dewoitine and his team designed a clean-sheet all-metal monoplane interceptor and submitted their proposal, designated D.500, to the Air Ministry. On 18 June 1932, the prototype made its maiden flight. During November 1933, an initial quantity of sixty aircraft was ordered from Dewoitine on behalf of the French Air Force, for whom the type was to serve as a replacement for the Nieuport 62. On 29 November 1934, the first production D.500  made its first flight.In service, those aircraft armed with a pair of twin nose-mounted machine guns were designated as D.500, while those with a single 20 mm cannon which fired through the propeller hub received the designation D.501. Perhaps the most significant derivative of the type was the D.510, the principle difference of which was the adoption of a more powerful Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine, capable of 640 kW (860 hp); minor refinements included a slightly lengthened nose, an increase in fuel capacity and a refined undercarriage arrangement. A total of 381 D.500s and its derivatives were built by the end of production. The design was further developed into the more capable Dewoitine D.520, which had an enclosed cockpit and a retractable undercarriage, unlike its predecessor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Because of the Nikon body, it had a Nikon F lens mount and so could use most lenses made for Nikon 35 mm cameras. It was autofocusing, had an electronically controlled focal plane shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/2000 sec. and built-in exposure metering and pop-up flash. Its ISO film speed equivalents ranged from 320-1600. \nThe camera is no longer in production, having been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S2 Pro in January 2002.\nAside from the Nikon lens mount, the camera's principal distinction was its unique (and controversial) 3.1 megapixel photo sensor. Known as the Super CCD, it was unique in having its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other SLR cameras. This allowed the use of a sophisticated interpolation system that, according to Fujifilm, produced an output image equivalent to 6.2 megapixels. The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lay somewhere between 3.1 megapixels and the 6.2 megapixel interpolated output.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

The command prompt was the less-than sign \"<\", and on receiving a single character command, it added this input character and the greater-than sign \">\". If the thermal printer was turned on, this would be output on a single line. The monitor included a number of service routines that could be accessed and used by a user's program to control I/O and code execution and was fully documented, including source code.\nThe machine featured dual cassette tape controls.  This made it possible to write large assembly programs using the two-pass assembler ROM. Source code in text was written twice consecutively to the input tape, and then the assembler, which could start/stop the input cassette tape using motor control, was invoked. During the first pass, the symbol table was built and stored in RAM. During the second pass, symbols would be translated and code written out on the second tape, also using start/stop motor control. Being able to avoid storing code in RAM made it possible to save a lot of space. It was, however, still important to keep the symbols list short since RAM size was often no more than 4 KB.\nIn 1981, Rockwell introduced an improved model with a 40-character display as the AIM-65/40.

{"id": "176_118", "question": "Which company is AMR 35 produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_56273", "text": "With his AMR 33 not yet being delivered to the French army \u2014 this would happen in June 1934 \u2014 Louis Renault used two of the five AMR 33 prototypes to improve the type. In the middle of February 1934 he sent the first, N\u00b0 79759, to the testing commission, after it had been lengthened and refitted with a much more powerful Nerva Stella 28 CV engine in September 1933, which now was placed at the back, instead of the front, of the vehicle. This was to reduce the effect of engine noise as well as to attain a better weight distribution, two problems that had become apparent in 1933 when the prototypes had been used for manoeuvres. The exhaust pipe was placed at the back and the ventilator moved from the right to the left side. Renault was hesitant to introduce such expensive improvements in the production run; but in February 1934 the head of the French Cavalry, General Flavigny, insisted on these changes being made.\nDuring testing the maximum speed was shown to be an impressive 72 km/h. Weight was just 4.68 metric tonnes (to which a 0.25 tonne simulation weight was added), the average road speed 40.5 km/h. However, some cavalry officers pointed out that the Renault Nerva Stella was a sports car and its engine rather delicate and thus unsuited to the rigours of military service. They proposed to use a more robust Renault city bus engine instead. In March the second prototype, N\u00b0 79760, was also lengthened twenty centimetres and fitted with a Renault 432 22 CV four-cylinder bus engine. This vehicle, with a weight of 5.03 tonnes and a simulation weight of 0.75 tonnes, was tested between 3 and 11 April at Vincennes and attained a maximum speed of 63.794 km/h and an average speed of 35.35 km/h. A subsequent order of 92 for the second version with its more reliable engine was made on 3 July 1934. This type, replacing the AMR 33 in the production run, was to have the name AMR 35. Of these, twelve were to be of a platoon command type, fitted with the AVIS-1 turret with a 7,5 mm machine gun and equipped with an ER1 radio set. The remaining eighty vehicles were to have a larger AVIS-2 turret with a 13.2 mm machine gun; 31 of the latter were also intended to be equipped with ER1 radio sets, though in 1937 it was decided to abandon this plan. Also eight radio command tanks were to be produced, which eventually would be called AMR 35 ADF 1, bringing the order to a total of hundred vehicles.At this time however it became clear that the AMR 33 suspension system, that originally had been intended to be used on the AMR 35 also, was very unreliable: the suspension units were simply too weak to withstand the forces caused by driving cross-country. A complete redesign of the suspension was ordered, also to be used for the new Renault R35. Three types were considered and tested on AMR 33 prototype N\u00b0 79758; the first had the idler resting on the ground; the second two bogies and five road wheels, like the R 35. This Renault ZB was rejected, but in March 1936 twelve were ordered by China and four a few months later by the Yunnan province administration. The latter were delivered in October 1938, the former only in 1940. The third suspension type had only one bogie per side and was accepted. The Renault factory designation of the vehicle with the relocated engine and new suspension was Renault ZT; it merely indicates the chronological order of Renault's military prototypes and has no further meaning.\nThe new suspension was first tested on a third prototype, in September 1934 newly built from boiler plate; its idler wheel was still of the AMR 33 suspension type and its turret was that of the second prototype.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Cadillac first used the name in 1916 to designate an enclosed 5-7 passenger sedan body style. In the thirties, the name was given to a formal body style with an open chauffeur compartment and enclosed rear quarters, metal roof and often \"razor-edged\" styling. When Cadillac started offering Fleetwood bodies on some of its cars in 1925, the Brougham body style was Fleetwood bodied every year with the exception of 1926.  After 1937, the Brougham name was not applied to any Cadillac for the remainder of the pre-World War II period.The Brougham name would eventually reappear on the 1955 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham show car which preceded the 4-door Eldorado Brougham hardtops of the 1957 to 1960 model years. The 1957 Cadillac Series 70 Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car, and so this would also mark the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name.\nAfter a five-year absence, the Brougham name reappeared as an option package on the 1965 Cadillac Sixty Special. The following year the Brougham moved up to becoming a subseries of the Fleetwood Sixty Special. This continued through 1970. Starting in 1971 the Sixty Special was only available as the well equipped Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham. When the Sixty Special Series was retired in 1977, the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham took its place as Cadillac's largest owner-driven sedan model through 1986.The single name \"Brougham\" began to be used as specific Cadillac model in 1987, when the term \"Fleetwood\" was dropped from the former Fleetwood Brougham.  It was otherwise the same as the 1986 model.  The reason for the change was that Cadillac had introduced a new front-wheel drive model in 1985 and named it simply the Fleetwood.  Compounding the confusion, the optional \"d'Elegance\" package (introduced in the upscale Fleetwood trim line in the 1970s, offering even more luxurious appointments, including button-tufted seating and rear-seat reading lamps), was available on and appended to the names of both models, resulting in a traditional body-on-frame/rear-wheel drive \"Fleetwood Brougham d' Elegance\" and a unibody/transverse engined \"Fleetwood d' Elegance\".  The solution was dropping the term \"Fleetwood\" from the rear-wheel drive model, leaving just the \"Brougham\". Since it was body-on-frame, it was popular among coachbuilders who manufactured stretched limousines, along with the similar but somewhat smaller Lincoln Town Car, as well as traditional Cadillac buyers who preferred the familiar combination of exterior size, heft, and rear-wheel drive. This was the last Cadillac to be produced without airbags.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The specification was for a peacetime requirement for an interim short-medium haul passenger aircraft to serve until the more advanced designs specified by the Brabazon Committee (in particular, the Airspeed Ambassador and Armstrong Whitworth Apollo) could be developed. To speed development the aircraft used the wing and undercarriage design from the Wellington but the fuselage was new. Although the original contract referred to Wellington Transport Aircraft, on completion, the name Viking was chosen.The first prototype (designated the Type 491 and registered G-AGOK) was built by the Vickers Experimental Department at its wartime Foxwarren dispersal site and was first flown by 'Mutt' Summers at Wisley Airfield on 22 June 1945. This aircraft crashed on 23 April 1946 due to a double engine failure; no fatalities occurred as a result of the crash. Following successful trials of the three prototypes the Ministry of Aircraft Production ordered 50 aircraft. The first BOAC aircraft flew on 23 March 1946. The prototypes were then used for trials with the Royal Air Force which led to orders for military versions (the Viking C2 (12 ordered as freighter/transports) and the modified Valetta C1).\n\nThe initial 19 production aircraft (later designated the Viking 1A) carried 21 passengers, they had metal fuselages and - except for the wing inboard of the nacelles - fabric-clad geodetic wings and tail units. Following feedback from customers, the next 14 examples, known as the Viking 1, featured stressed-metal wings and tail units. The next variant, the Viking 1B, was 28 in (71 cm) longer, carrying 24 passengers with up-rated Bristol Hercules piston engines, achieved a production run of 115. One of this batch was changed during production to so that it could be fitted with two Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engines, with its first flight on 6 April 1948.\nOn 25 July 1948, on the 39th anniversary of Bl\u00e9riot's crossing of the English Channel, the Type 618 Nene-Viking flew Heathrow\u2013Paris (Villacoublay) in the morning carrying letters to Bleriot's widow and son (secretary of the FAI), who met it at the airport. The flight of 222 miles (357 km) took only 34 minutes. It then flew back to London in the afternoon. It obtained a maximum speed of 415 mph (668 km/h) at 12,000 ft (3,700 m) and averaged 394 mph (634 km/h). In 1954 it was bought from the Ministry of Supply and underwent the substantial conversion to Hercules 634 piston engines by Eagle Aviation to join their fleet.Production finished in 1948, including 16 for the RAF of which four were for the King's Flight, but in 1952 BEA adapted some to a 38-passenger layout, taking the maximum payload up from 5,500 to 7,200 lb (2,500 to 3,300 kg). All Vikings featured a tailwheel undercarriage.\nThe 58th Viking (c/n 158) became the prototype of the military Valetta, of which 262 were produced for the RAF. When production of this strengthened but externally similar type ended in 1952, a flying classroom version with tricycle undercarriage was already being delivered to the Royal Air Force (RAF), called the Varsity. All but one of those entered RAF service, the other example going to the Swedish Air Force. The production of 161 Varsities kept the Hurn works busy until January 1954, and they enjoyed a long service life.

In what would give the model line its name, the exterior was given European \"continental\" styling elements, including a rear-mounted spare tire.\nIn production for over 55 years across nine different decades, Lincoln has produced ten generations of the Continental. Within the Lincoln model line, the Continental has served several roles ranging from its flagship to its base-trim sedan. From 1961 to 1976, Lincoln sold the Continental as its exclusive model line.  The model line has also gone on hiatus three times. From 1949 to 1955, the nameplate was briefly retired. In 1981, the Continental was renamed the Lincoln Town Car to accommodate the 1982 seventh-generation Continental.  After 2002, the Continental was retired, largely replaced by the Lincoln MKS in 2009; in 2017, the tenth-generation Continental replaced the MKS.\nAs part of its entry into full-scale production, the first-generation Continental was the progenitor of an entirely new automotive segment, the personal luxury car.

The upper wing, however, while giving excellent upwards view to the pilot, gave a poor downwards view of the pilot, particularly during landing, while the Davis gun had lost favour with the Admiralty as an anti-Zeppelin weapon.  The P.V.2 was therefore rebuilt as the P.V.2bis with a revised, longer span upper wing mounted 12 inches (0.30 m) above the fuselage and the Davis gun replaced by two Lewis guns mounted above the wing, firing over the propeller.

The first was armed with two coaxial 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine guns on a rotatable mount which was protected by armour plate at the front and sides. The second had no fixed armament. Neither one was accepted for service. In 1950 two new prototypes were produced. Those had a different shape of armour including an upright rear armour. Again one prototype had no fixed armament and the second was armed with two coaxial 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine guns. These were accepted into service as BTR-40 and BTR-40A respectively.The vehicle's drawbacks, such as its poor cross-country performance and problems with crossing water obstacles, compelled the design team to produce, in late 1954, what was planned to be an amphibious variant of the BTR-40. It received the designation BTR-40P (with the 'P' standing for plavayushchiy \u2013 \"floating\"). During the design process, the vehicle moved away from the APC concept and became an amphibious armoured scout car. It received a new designation, BRDM.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After burnout, they were jettisoned and parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean where they were recovered, examined, refurbished, and reused.\nThe Space Shuttle SRBs were the most powerful solid rocket motors to ever launch humans. The Space Launch System (SLS) SRBs, adapted from the shuttle, surpassed it as the most powerful solid rocket motors ever flown, after the launch of the Artemis 1 mission in 2022. Each Space Shuttle SRB provided a maximum 14.7 MN (3,300,000 lbf) thrust, roughly double the most powerful single-combustion chamber liquid-propellant rocket engine ever flown, the Rocketdyne F-1. With a combined mass of about 1,180 t (1,160 long tons; 1,300 short tons), they comprised over half the mass of the Shuttle stack at liftoff. The motor segments of the SRBs were manufactured by Thiokol of Brigham City, Utah, which was later purchased by ATK. The prime contractor for most other components of the SRBs, as well as for the integration of all the components and retrieval of the spent SRBs, was USBI, a subsidiary of Pratt & Whitney.

The GSV-R replaced Suzuki's 500 cc two-stroke V4 RGV500 which was ridden by Kenny Roberts Jr. to win the 500cc World Championship in 2000.\nThe GSV-R was introduced on 2002, one year earlier than the original plan, with codename XRE0. New regulations were promoting the growth of four-stroke engines, and the performance of the new engine during testing was strong according to Suzuki. Despite the use of a new engine, XRE0 was using the old RGV500 Gamma Chassis, which was later criticized as a big mistake by many MotoGP analysts. Using the chassis and fairings that were previously made for the two-stroke RGV500 engine, XRE0 was hampered by many stability issues. The use of RGV500 Tyre spec was another mistake. Despite all of that, XRE0 was able to taste its first podium (2nd place) on the opening round at Suzuka and got third place at Rio in the same year. XRE0 achievements however were inconsistent, as the riders often fell down, crashed, or were forced to retire by technical failures. The top XRE0 rider by the end of The 2002 MotoGP Championship was Kenny Roberts Jr. in ninth place overall.\nFor 2007, MotoGP rules were changed to allow a maximum displacement of 800 cc. Suzuki introduced an 800 cc version of the GSV-R also known as GSV-R800.  The GSV-R800 was codenamed XRG0 because of its newly redesigned engine based on displacement limitations.  The new XRG0 engine was based from the layout of the 2006 990 cc GSV-R however, the XRG0 engines bore, stroke, and cylinder pitch had been redesigned to better suit the 800 cc engine displacement.  The factory Rizla Suzuki MotoGP team stated the new engines aim was to \u2018achieve the best possible horsepower and reliable high rpm operation, and to provide the riders with user friendly power delivery and predictable engine character.\u2019   The XRG0 was also equipped with a redesigned engine control unit supplied by Mitsubishi, capable of producing 220 horsepower at 17,500 rpm.  The chassis layout and wheelbase length from the 2006 GSV-R XRE4 used in the 2006 MotoGP season remained on the new model, however the fairing design had been updated to better accommodate high speed stability.The 2008 MotoGP season brought another redesigned GSV-R800 that Suzuki codenamed XRG1 as the successor to the XRG0 of the previous year.  This second generation 800 cc four-stroke prototype was the most complex and technically advanced racing motorcycle Suzuki had ever produced at its time.  The XRG1 had been developed closely with team riders Chris Vermeulen and Loris Capirossi and the feedback from the MotoGP team and Suzuki test engineers.  A key focus area in refining the XRG1 was improving acceleration.  This was accomplished by refining every detail of the 2007 XRG0 engine and an updated Mitsubishi ECU.  The resulted engine redesigning provided lower fuel consumption and increased usability.  Further refinements of the XRG0 chassis for the 2008 XRG1 allowed for better cornering performance and change of direction.  Along with the chassis refinements, a newly designed fairing  was developed to reduce wind resistance to enhance handling characteristics.At the end of 2011 Suzuki pulled out of MotoGP until at least 2014, citing the need to reduce costs amid the global economic downturn.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was designed to be compatible for all data formats. However the word size and instruction set were completely different; this presented significant difficulty as all programs had to be rewritten, so many customers switched to different vendors instead of upgrading existing UNIVACs.\nThe UNIVAC III weighed about 27,225 pounds (13.6 short tons; 12.3 t).The system was engineered to use as little core memory as possible, as it was a very expensive item. The memory system was 25 bits wide and could be configured with from 8,192 words to 32,768 words of memory. Memory was built in stacks of 29 planes of 4,096 cores: 25 for the data word, two for \"modulo-3 check\" bits, and two for spares. Each memory cabinet held up to four stacks (16,384 words).\nIt supported the following data formats:\n\n25-bit signed binary numbers\nexcess-3 binary-coded decimal with four bits per digit, allowing six-digit signed decimal numbers\nalphanumerics with six bits per character, allowing four-character signed alphanumeric valuesInstructions were 25 bits long.\n\nThe CPU had four accumulators, a four-bit field (ar) allowed selection of any combination of the accumulators for operations on data from one to four words in length. For backward compatibility with the UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II data, two accumulators were needed to store a 12-digit decimal number and three accumulators were needed to store a 12-character alphanumeric value. When accumulators were combined in an instruction, the sign bit of the Most Significant Accumulator was used and the others ignored.\nThe CPU had 15 index registers, a four-bit field (x) allowed selection of one index register as the base register. Operand addresses were determined by adding the contents of the selected base register and the 10-bit displacement field (m). Instructions that modified or stored index registers used a four-bit field (xo) to select that index register.\nIndirect addressing or field selection was selected if the one-bit field (i/a) was set. Both indirect addressing and a base register could be selected in the indirect address in memory. Only a base register could be selected in the field selector in memory.\n\nSperry Rand began shipment in June 1962 and produced 96 UNIVAC III systems.\nThe operating systems(s) which were developed for the UNIVAC III's were called CHIEF, and BOSS.The assembly language was SALT. The majority of UNIVAC III systems were equipped with tape drives; tapes contained images of the system data at the head of any tape, followed by data.  The OS could handle jobs at this time, so some tapes had data relating to job control, and others had data.  UNIVAC III systems could have up to 32 tape drives.\nSome systems were equipped at a later time with a random-access FASTRAND drum.", "hasanswer": true}]}

In May 2013 the company said that it was waiting for inductive charging industry standards before launching the vehicle.\nThe Infiniti LE Concept is based on the Nissan Leaf platform. However the LE concept is powered by a 100 kW (134 hp), 325 N\u22c5m (240 ft\u22c5lb) electric motor, rather than the 80 kW (107 hp), 285 N\u22c5m (210 ft\u22c5lb) motor used in the Leaf. Like the Leaf, the LE will also utilize a 24 kWh or larger lithium-ion battery pack mounted below the passenger compartment. Driving range on a single charge is estimated to be about 160 km (100 miles).  The LE is aerodynamically clean with its high rear deck, aero-treated wheels, rear diffuser, front spoiler and side spoilers to give a drag coefficient of Cd=0.25.

{"id": "176_213", "question": "Which company is LINC-8 produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_56635", "text": "The LINC-8 contains one PDP-8 CPU and one LINC CPU, partially emulated by the PDP-8. At any one time, the computer is in either 'LINC mode' or 'PDP-8 mode' - both processors can not run in parallel. Instructions are provided to switch between modes. In the LINC-8, all interrupts are handled by the PDP-8 CPU, and programs that rely on the interrupt architecture of the LINC can not be run.\nThe LINC is a 12-bit ones' complement accumulator machine, whereas the PDP-8, while also a 12-bit accumulator machine, operates in two's complement arithmetic.\nMemory addressing on the two architectures is also different. On the LINC, the full address space is divided into 1024-word segments, two of which are selected for use at any one time: the instruction field and the data field. Direct access of data in the instruction field is possible using 10-bit addresses. The data field can only be indirectly addressed.  The Instruction field and Data field are theoretically capable of being chosen from up to 32 areas of 1K 12-bit words each as the maximum architecture is 32K total words.  As a practical matter, few LINC-8 systems ever were expanded to 8K total.  Memory expansion is accomplished first by adding PDP-8 memory extension hardware and extended memory instructions and a few minor LINC processor modifications to address the memory beyond the basic 4K total.  Once this is accomplished, 4K memory \"wings\" can be added in a daisy-chained buss arrangement, which in theory could be expanded out as many as seven times to implement the entire 32K.  As a practical matter, it is always difficult to implement on the \"regular\" PDP-8, and, in the case of the LINC-8, it becomes necessary to slow down the CPU slightly just to add on the first additional 4K.\nThus, as a practical matter, LINC-8 memory segments are limited to segment 0-3, or perhaps 0-7 on the few 8K implementations.  However, basic 4K machines cannot address beyond 0-3 while extended memory models can attempt to address segments 0-37 octal even if non-existent memory.\nBy convention, the segment 0 area is not available for normal fully emulated LINC operations.  This is because the PDP-8 program usually known as PROGOFOP is loaded there to handle all interrupts, traps, etc.  It is possible to write a program for a \"partial\" LINC CPU, meaning using only the hardware that actually exists.  Whenever an operation is performed that it cannot handle, the PDP-8 operation resumes.  However, the LINC operation could have been terminated for a variety of reasons.  As such, it is always recommended that PROGOFOP be loaded when attempting to use \"complete\" LINC programs on this system.\nMany operating systems were written for this machine; some were essentially slightly modified versions designed for the original LINC CPU it is partially based on.  Bootup conventions allow an image of a custom version of PROGOFOP to first be loaded, followed by executing tape instructions to load the LINC-based operating system.  In some cases, the bootup procedure is accomplished manually right on the LINC console switches; later systems self-start the system after loading PROGOFOP.\nOther operating systems are actually more generic and are designed to mostly ignore the LINC side of things.  These are PDP-8-only systems, although perhaps custom configured for the vagaries of the specifics of a LINC-8.  In some cases, this means that they cannot be run on any other machine; in other cases, the LINC-8 merely represented a normal variation of drivers off of an otherwise non-descript PDP-8 system.  An advantage of a PDP-8-based system is that PROGOFOP is superfluous here.  If needed, the PDP-8 system can load PROGOFOP as well as a user program primarily LINC-oriented to get at the laboratory peripherals.  The LINC convention of the entire first 1K being unavailable reserved for PROGOFOP is exchanged for the far smaller PDP-8 convention of reserving only 07600-07777 or the last 128-word page of the first 4K of the machine.  This corresponds to a small reserved area at the end of LINC segment 3 in exchange for much greater overall flexibility.\nThe PDP-8 divides its memory into 128-word pages. An instruction can reference the current page, that being the page where the instruction itself was located, or page 0, the 128 words of memory at addresses 0-127. Indirect addressing can be used to produce 12-bit addresses.  If more than 4K memory is implemented, the indirect addressing is extended to include the Data Field, thus it is possible to access any location indirectly in 32K maximum.  Again, hardware limitations of the LINC-8 make it hard to achieve a total size of more than 8K total.  Also implemented is the Instruction Field, making it possible to load larger programs into the same addressing space the Data Field controls.  Transfer of control can be either direct or indirect as required.  The new address is determined by first setting the new Instruction Field value, and then executing a JMP or JMS instruction into the new field's corresponding 12-bit address, thus effecting a 15-bit address overall.\nThe computer includes a number of LINC peripherals, which are controlled by special LINC mode instructions. These devices include analog inputs in the forms of knobs and jacks, relays for control of external equipment, LINCtape drives (the predecessor of the DECtape), an oscilloscope-like cathode ray tube under program control, as well as a Teletype Model 33 ASR.  Actually, the CRT is a specially modified unit based on a standard Tektronix oscilloscope modified to only be driven by D-A converters and an intensifier interface; there are no sweep circuits as found in conventional oscilloscopes.  Most of the modifications involve custom highly stripped down plug in modules, which also house the actual knobs hooked to the lowest A-D channels.  Arguably, this is the precursor to the modern mouse interface; some software utilized knob twirling in a manner that would later suggest the two-dimensional form of a mouse; these are knobs controlling only one parameter at a time, etc.\nSome of these peripherals are simulated and are actually peripherals of the PDP-8.  Any unimplemented operation stops the LINC CPU and interrupts the PDP-8 processor to handle the specifics.  Most notably, the LINCtape is actually a PDP-8 peripheral; the tape class of LINC instructions are trapped and interrupt the PDP-8 which then emulates how a real LINC or PDP-12 would carry out the specifics of the latest tape instruction.  Pressing a variety of keys on the seemingly present LINC console all cause PDP-8 interrupts; PROGOFOP is designed to emulate the functions as they would appear on the original LINC.\nAn interesting feature is the FETCH/EXEC stop, which is implemented in all hardware in the LINC and PDP-12.  The hardware, when enabled, continuously monitors instruction execution until specific conditions are met.  This will cause a PDP-8 interrupt stalling the LINC program.  Simulated console operations can be used to examine memory or make other changes, such as pressing the simulated DO key.  The DO key executes any one instruction on the left switch register while the right switch register may have to also be set in the case of double word instructions such as most of the tape class.  Booting certain operating systems consists of executing a tape read instruction directly from both sets of switches pressing the simulated DO key followed by pressing the simulated START 20 switch.  In essence, the LINC-8 implements all of the functions of the console panel of the \"real\" LINC, then uses the PDP-8 to simulate most of them.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His managers did patent the richest claims, the Arizona Central, Copper Mountain, Montezuma, and Yankee.\nIn the late 1870s William Church, a mine speculator from Denver, Colorado, negotiated the purchase of the company stock.  Church became the true father of the camp.  . With a loan from the partners in Phelps, Dodge, during 1882 he erected furnaces, opened the mines, and began shipping copper east. As a reflection of frontier conditions of the times, he was attacked by Apaches at his smelter in 1882, and twice robbed at gunpoint in his office during the early 1880s.  On the advice of Dr. James Douglas (businessman), consultant for Phelps Dodge, the smelter was relocated from the San Francisco River to the mines. The first concentrator was built and a \"baby\" gauge railroad connected the DCC mines with the transport system of the neighboring Arizona Copper Company, which connected to the transcontinental Southern Pacific Railroad. Church had made his DCC into one of the early, respectable copper operations in the territory. In 1897, he sold his 55% interests in the DCC to Phelps Dodge for a reported $800,000, retired to his stone mansion in Denver's capitol hill neighborhood, and earned a reputation as philanthropist and real estate baron.James Douglas became president and general manager of the operation for Phelps Dodge, which increased the DCC capital stock from $500,000 to one million dollars, and over the next four years greatly expanded DCC operations with a new rail connection, concentrator, and improved, rebuilt smelter. Metallurgist and Douglas protege, Dr. L.D. Ricketts designed the 600 ton Yankee concentrator, one of the most innovative of the time, and the first of many modern, ever enlarging plants built in the district (steel beams with iron sheeting, Wilfley tables, vanners and jigs for gravity concentration, which could work ores under 3% copper). The Morenci Southern narrow gauge railroad, completed in 1901, connected the mines via five loops over itself in the 18 miles of rails down the mountainside to a junction with the New Mexico & Arizona line. A network of \"baby\" gauge railroad tracks connected the mine works, plants, and the Morenci Southern. Under Dr. Douglas, the smelter was rebuilt with five blast furnaces and Bessemer converters which produced a purer copper for the market. At its peak, Detroit Copper Co. consisted of 145 mining claims at Morenci.Detroit Copper Co. founded the town of Morenci (originally named Joy's camp after Ward's first local manager) to supply housing and services to workers employed by the company. After a devastating fire in 1897, Morenci was relocated three quarters of a mile down the canyon. DCC managers organized the Morenci Improvement Company to help rebuild the town and construct better housing. In time, DCC or the improvement company owned a large store, a hotel, and considerable amounts of additional property in the town of Morenci. DCC also funded a free public library, gymnasium and improved schools for workers and their families. At the beginning of the twentieth century the town of Morenci had distinctive southwestern architecture, with Spanish mission style and rustic stone buildings used by the company around a central camp plaza. (The original \"Hell's Half Acre\" of saloons and brothels were re-built away from the plaza). DCC also established a water pumping plant on the San Francisco River seven miles away. The nearby smelter town of Clifton was settled to provide additional housing, and eventually eclipsed the camp becoming Greenlee county seat.The company employed mostly Mexican miners, who were paid about half what Caucasian miners earned. During the Church era, Mexican miners were paid with company script, or paper \"boletas, which could only be spent at the company store, a base for contention between miners and the company. The boleta system was eased out after the DCC was acquired by Phelps Dodge. As with many mines in Arizona and New Mexico at the time, the Detroit Copper Co. saw several waves of labor union organizing as well as strikes from 1900 onward. DCC used labor spies to infiltrate nascent unions and stop organizing campaigns.A significant problem in early copper camps were disputes over ownership of ore bodies based on the 1872 Mining Law's \"rule of the apex.\" This was defined where the company which owned the apex (or outcrop) of an ore body could mine ore across mine claim boundaries following vein \"dips, spurs, and angles\u201d. Church was able to avoid a potential lawsuit with neighboring claim holders by agreeing to ignore the rule of the apex and use British common law, whereby the companies extracted ore from only within their claim boundaries. In May 1882, Church's company agreed to co-develop the \"Detroit lode\" with the Longfellow Copper Mining Company (later purchased by the Arizona Copper Company). Although federal and state law provided that the company which accessed the lode had the right to develop the entire deposit, Detroit Copper lacked the capital to do so and agreed to permit Longfellow Copper to mine the lode as well, up to their agreed claim boundaries. This shift away from the rule of the apex to common law was followed later in other Arizona copper districts, most notably at Bisbee, Arizona.After the 1917 reorganization of the Phelps Dodge & Co holding company into the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the Detroit Copper Company ceased to exist. The operation was then known as \"Phelps Dodge Corporation, Morenci Branch.\" In 1921, Phelps Dodge acquired the mines of the adjacent Arizona Copper Company, Ltd, creating a world class copper operation, which is now one of the largest copper producers in the United States.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Not long after, the company produced a 300 hp (220 kW) 5 by 6 inches (127 mm \u00d7 152 mm) engine that saw limited use in railcar applications on the B&O, Milwaukee Road, and a few other lines. Additionally, two of the 5 \u00d7 6s were placed in an experimental center cab switcher locomotive under development by the Reading Railroad (road #87, built in 1939 by the St. Louis Car Company, or SLCC, and scrapped in 1953). A 5 x 6 powered the plant switcher at F-M's Beloit, Wisconsin manufacturing facility.\nIn 1939, the SLCC placed F-M 800 hp (600 kW) 8 by 10 inches (203 mm \u00d7 254 mm) engines in six streamlined railcars, which are known today as the FM OP800. In 1944, F-M began production of its own 1,000-horsepower (0.75 MW) yard switcher, the H-10-44. Milwaukee Road #760 (originally delivered as #1802), the first Fairbanks-Morse locomotive constructed in their own plant, is now preserved and on display at the Illinois Railway Museum. F-M had yet to produce a railroad road locomotive, or any locomotive prior to the 1944 switcher which was built several years after its conception; all other locomotive producers, except for General Motors (and a few others who manufactured small industrial locomotives), were forced by the government to continue to build reciprocating steam locomotives during much of the war.  All national locomotive production  was subject to strict wartime restrictions regarding the number and type of railroad-related products they could manufacture (the U.S. Government in the name of the Navy commandeered all F-M O-P production well into 1944). Following World War II, North American railways began phasing out their aging steam locomotives and sought to replace them with state-of-the-art diesel locomotives at an ever-increasing rate due to the unfavourable economics of steam propulsion.  Fairbanks-Morse, along with its competing firms, sought to capitalize on this new market opportunity.\nIn December 1945 F-M produced its first streamlined, cab/carbody dual service diesel locomotive as direct competition to such models as the ALCO FA and PA and EMD FT and E-unit. Assembly of the 2,000 horsepower (1.49 MW) unit, which was mounted on an A1A-A1A wheelset, was subcontracted out to General Electric due to lack of space at F-M's Wisconsin plant. GE built the locomotives at its Erie, Pennsylvania facility, thereby giving rise to the name \u201cErie-built\u201d. F-M retained the services of renowned industrial designer Raymond Loewy to create a visually impressive carbody for the Erie-built. The line was only moderately successful, as a total of 82 cab and 28 booster units was sold through 1949, when production was ended. The Erie-Built program faced several problems, including a nine-month strike in Beloit near the start of production, the cost of outsourcing much of the Erie-Built's design and production to GE, and several high-cost components including two types of unique truck and secondary electrical and cooling systems.F-M wanted to produce a carbody successor to the Erie-Built which could be manufactured in-house, and this required a new ground-up design and expansion of the locomotive shop at Beloit. Because of the design parameters laid down for the new locomotives, only the O-P engine, the traction motors, and a few accessories could be carried over from F-M's hood locomotives. The resulting Consolidation Line (known in-house as the C-Line) debuted in January 1950.\nC-liners took many of their design cues from the Erie-builts, using a carbody that was 56 ft 3 in (17.15 m) long. This was 8 ft (2.4 m) shorter than the Erie-Built, yet had room for a 12-cylinder OP engine (as opposed to the Erie-built's 10-cylinder engine) and a 4,500-lb-per-hour steam generator. The C-Line was offered with 8-cylinder 1,600 hp (1.19 MW), 10-cylinder 2,000 hp (1.49 MW), and 12-cylinder 2,400 hp (1,800 kW) versions of F-M's 38D8-1/8 opposed-piston diesel prime movers.

The test was delayed to provide notice to the United States Congress. The target was the Solwind P78-1, an orbiting solar observatory that was launched on 24 February 1979.On 13 September 1985, Maj. Wilbert D. \"Doug\" Pearson, flying the \"Celestial Eagle\" F-15A 76-0084 launched an ASM-135 ASAT about 320 kilometres (200 mi) west of Vandenberg Air Force Base and destroyed the Solwind P78-1 satellite flying at an altitude of 555 kilometres (345 mi). Prior to the launch, the F-15 \u2014 flying at Mach 1.22 \u2014 executed a 3.8 g0 (37 m/s2) zoom climb at an angle of 65 degrees. The ASM-135 ASAT was automatically launched at 11,600 metres (38,100 ft) while the F-15 was flying at Mach 0.934 (992.2 km/h; 616.5 mph). The 14 kilograms (30 lb) MHV collided with the 910 kilograms (2,000 lb) Solwind P78-1 satellite at closing velocity of 24,000 kilometres per hour (15,000 mph; 6.7 km/s).NASA learned of U.S. Air Force plans for the Solwind ASAT test in July 1985. NASA modeled the effects of the test. This model determined that debris produced would still be in orbit in the 1990s. It would force NASA to enhance debris shielding for its planned space station.Earlier the U.S. Air Force and NASA had worked together to develop a Scout-launched target vehicle for ASAT experiments. NASA advised the U.S. Air Force on how to conduct the ASAT test to avoid producing long-lived debris. However, congressional restrictions on ASAT tests intervened.In order to complete an ASAT test before an expected Congressional ban took effect (as it did in October 1985), the DoD chose to use the existing Solwind astrophysics satellite as a target.NASA worked with the DoD to monitor the effects of the tests using two orbital debris telescopes and a reentry radar deployed to Alaska.NASA assumed the torn metal would be bright. Surprisingly, the Solwind pieces turned out to appear so dark as to be almost undetectable. Only two pieces were seen. NASA Scientists theorized that the unexpected Solwind darkening was due to carbonization of organic compounds in the target satellite; that is, when the kinetic energy of the projectile became heat energy on impact, the plastics inside Solwind vaporized and condensed on the metal pieces as soot.NASA used U.S. Air Force infrared telescopes to show that the pieces were warm with heat absorbed from the Sun. This added weight to the contention that they were dark with soot and not reflective. The pieces decayed quickly from orbit, implying a large area-to-mass ratio. According to NASA, as of January 1998, 8 of 285 trackable pieces remained in orbit. The last piece of debris, COSPAR 1979-017GX, SATCAT 16564, deorbited 9 May 2004 according to SATCAT.\nThe Solwind test had three important results:\n\nIt raised the possibility that the objects optical systems were detecting were large and dark, not small and bright as was generally assumed. This had implications for the calibration of optical and radar orbital debris detection systems.\nThe test also created a baseline event for researchers seeking a characteristic signature of a hypervelocity collision in space.\nAwareness was raised about the orbital debris problem.In the end, the Solwind ASAT test had few consequences for the planned U.S. space station as station completion (indeed, even the launch of first module) was pushed beyond the mid-1990s. The record-high level of solar activity during the 1989\u20131991 solar maximum heated and expanded the atmosphere more than anticipated in 1985, accelerating Solwind debris decay.\nFifteen ASM-135 ASAT missiles were produced and five missiles were flight tested.", "hasanswer": false}]}

(The club made several appearances in movies like Dolemite and Black Fist.) Simmons' nightclub booked R&B-oriented musical acts, and Simmons' interest in music led him to buy a recording studio. In 1978, he signed a little-known R&B act, the Greenwood, Archer and Pine Street Band, (shortened in 1973 by a typo to the Gap Band) to his production company, and secured a record deal with Mercury Records. The band, consisting of twelve members, was reduced officially to the three Wilson brothers. Their first Total Experience-produced single, 1979's \"Shake\", went to #4 on the R&B charts.\nSimmons' skills as a composer, however, would take the Gap Band to the next level. When they released The Gap Band II late in 1979, a song Simmons co-wrote with the Wilson brothers, \"Oops Up Side Your Head\", not only matched the success of \"Shake\" on the R&B charts, reaching #4 also, but exceeded it by propelling the album to over half-a-million in sales. Simmons had co-written only one song on The Gap Band but co-wrote six of The Gap Band II's seven tracks.\nIn 1980, Charlie Wilson went on a trip to Dallas and returned with two new friends: Cavin Yarbrough and Alisa Peoples. After a brief audition, Simmons exchanged contact information with them. When they showed up in LA, he suggested they record a demo with the label's other producer, who also served as their songwriter. They recorded the demo, and when he heard it, Simmons had yet another act in his ranks: Yarbrough and Peoples. That year, Simmons co-wrote two songs which peaked on the R&B charts at #1 back-to-back: \"Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)\", which was released on The Gap Band III, and \"Don't Stop the Music\", which was released on Yarbrough & Peoples' debut album, The Two of Us. The latter album went gold, while the former went platinum, selling over a million copies.\nSimmon's winning streak continued in 1981, when he formed Total Experience Records and convinced Mercury's parent company PolyGram to distribute the label's recordings. He then transferred the Gap Band and Yarbrough & Peoples (who were already signed to his production company) to the Total Experience label. Gap Band IV was released in early 1982 and spawned three singles, which all peaked in the top-40 on the dance charts and top-2 on the R&B songs: #1 \"Early in the Morning\", #2 \"You Dropped a Bomb on Me\" (both of which Simmons helped write), and #1 \"Outstanding\", the first two of which Simmons wrote. The album went platinum within a year. Later in 1982, he signed Robert \"Goodie\" Whitfield to the label. His debut album, Call Me Goodie, peaked at #31 R&B.\nThe Gap Band's 1983 release, Gap Band V: Jammin' (#2 R&B, #28 Billboard 200), saw Simmons take a reduced writing/producing role; he co-wrote only one song. The album went gold, headlined by the only Simmons co-penned single, \"Party Train\", which went to #3 on the R&B charts. Yarbrough and Peoples released Heartbeats that year, and it peaked at #25 R&B, and the title track went to #10 R&B. One of their 1984 singles, \"Be a Winner\", topped the R&B charts.\nIn 1984, Total Experience began a new distribution deal with RCA Records.\nEven though his two major acts produced hits well into the mid-80s, Total Experience began to falter. During 1984 and 1985, the label expanded from three acts to fourteen, including Bernie Hamilton & the Inculcation Band and Switch. Not a single one of the newcomers released more than one album with Total Experience (two of them only produced one song) and none of them scored any hits. Meanwhile, Yarbrough and Peoples got married and moved back to Texas, and Goodie quit. This left the Gap Band as the label's sole act by 1986.\nThe Gap Band's subsequent releases, Gap Band VII and Gap Band 8, received chart success due to heavy radio airplay but sold few actual copies. The Gap Band's final hurrah with Total Experience, Straight from the Heart, got a top-40 song from the title track but failed to sell, causing the Gap Band to leave for Capitol Records.\nWith no acts remaining, Lonnie dropped out of music, and his company turned to motion picture and video production.\nSimmons died on February 6, 2019.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Each vessel would carry one or two rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIBs) and have accommodation for nine Canadian Coast Guard personnel as well as up to five Department of Fisheries and Oceans or Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers. The vessels were originally designed to  be equipped with a stern launching ramp, allowing RHIBs to be launched and retrieved while the vessel was in motion.The final design for Hero-class vessels is based on those of the Dutch Damen Stan 4207 patrol vessel. The vessels are 42.8 m (140 ft) long overall with a beam of 7 m (23 ft) and a draught of 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in). The vessels have a 253 gross tonnage (GT) and a 75 net tonnage (NT). The ships are propelled by two controllable pitch propellers and bow thrusters powered by two MTU 4000M geared diesel engines creating 4,992 kW (6,694 hp). This gives the vessels a maximum speed of 25 knots (46 km/h). The Hero class have a diesel fuel capacity of 34.00 m3 (7,480 imp gal), a range of 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km) at 14 knots (26 km/h) and can stay at sea for up to 14 days.The vessels are equipped with two RHIBs launched by a single Allied Marine TB10-23 davit. The patrol ships have Sperry Marine Visionmaster FT radar that operates on the S and X bands. The Hero class have a complement of nine with capacity for five more. According to CBC News on 13 November 2012, Canadian Minister of Defence Peter MacKay announced that Canada was considering arming the Hero-class vessels, during a speech he delivered at the launch of CCGS Caporal Kaeble V.C., the second vessel of the class. MacKay said the Organization of American States had suggested Canada reconsider arming Canadian Coast Guard vessels to help counter the drug trade and people smuggling.  Coast Guard vessels have never been armed before, while, occasionally, when carrying elements of the RCMP, the RCMP have carried small arms. A Senate committee recommended Coast Guard vessels should be armed. Michael Byers, a law professor and commentator on Arctic sovereignty and maritime law has argued that Canadian Coast Guard vessels should have the \"quiet authority of a deck-mounted gun\".Criticism of the design and capabilities were raised by safety representatives, citing eleven issues. The vessels suffered numerous issues over their first years of service, including bad wiring, premature corrosion and gearbox failure. Irving Shipbuilding responded to the claims, acknowledging the problems as minor, but stating that Canadian Coast Guard officials and representatives from the marine classification society Lloyd's Register certified the vessels.

Cessna formally launched the Skycatcher program 10 July 2007, following with a press event on 22 July 2007 at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh that unveiled a full-scale mockup and details about the planned production version.\nThe conforming prototype had its first flight on 8 March 2008, and the first initial production configuration aircraft flew on 5 May 2008.The company carried out testing of the aircraft beyond the ASTM Light Sport Aircraft requirements, including ground vibration testing and a full airframe fatigue test program on a production aircraft. In July 2009, Cessna announced that the 162 had completed flight testing to ASTM standards.On 9 August 2007, Cessna Aircraft announced that they had orders for 720 Skycatchers totaling US$75M. By 24 November 2007, Cessna had 850 firm orders and by the end of 2008 the company had confirmed over 1,000 orders. In July 2009, orders were still reported at \"over 1,000.\" Cessna vice president of propeller aircraft sales John Doman said sales activity had been slow because customers did not want to wait approximately four years for a delivery slot. In December 2009, the company delivered the first production Skycatcher to its initial customer, Cessna CEO Jack Pelton's wife, Rose Pelton. The company intended that the 2010 production rate would be 300 to 400 a year, but only 30 aircraft were delivered in 2010. By late 2013 \"droves\" of position holders had canceled their orders due to price increases and failure of the design to meet expectations.In October 2013, at the National Business Aviation Association convention, Cessna CEO Scott Ernest stated that the Cessna 162 had \"no future\". Cessna Vice President, Piston Aircraft, Jodi Noah, indicated that the aircraft had not met expectations.In February 2014, sales were halted. In December 2016, the remaining 80 unsold 162s were scrapped. These had been used to provide parts to keep the flying fleet going.In analyzing the imminent end of Skycatcher production, Paul Bertorelli of AVweb indicated that the reasons for ending production were high price, poor useful load and lackluster flight performance compared to its LSA market competitors.In a February 2017 review of the aircraft's history, AVweb writer Geoff Rapoport blamed the aircraft's failure on an empty weight that was too high, fragile construction and lack of cockpit space for taller pilots. He stated, \"the Skycatcher can\u2019t keep up because it wasn\u2019t really designed as an LSA. It\u2019s a scaled-down Cessna 152, which is a scaled-down Cessna 172, which is a scaled-down 747. I hope I\u2019m not bursting anyone\u2019s bubble by pointing out that Cessna is not exactly a modern innovator in design of light aircraft.\" He concluded, \"is this all the proof we need that LSAs make for bad airplanes?

{"id": "176_266", "question": "Which company is Game Gear produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_40994", "text": "In February 2012, a site named \"Development Without Borders\" owned by Konami was uploaded promoting development for a new Metal Gear title, which was titled \"The 'next' MGS\". The site was recruiting staff for the 2012 GDC pavilion in March, and requested applications for several positions for the latest Metal Gear Solid targeted for \"high-end consoles and PC\" and \"next-gen Fox engine\". As the year went on, screenshots and videos of the newly announced Fox Engine were unveiled by the team. This media demonstrated a range of settings and characters, none explicitly related to the Metal Gear series. Certain screenshots, however, were noted to feature a character who resembled Metal Gear's Big Boss walking up to a Stryker AFV, previously seen in Metal Gear Solid 4.The game was announced on August 30, 2012, originally under the name of Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes. It was revealed at a private function celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Metal Gear series, and made its public debut two days later at the 2012 Penny Arcade Expo. Director Hideo Kojima confirmed that Big Boss would return as the game's protagonist, and that the story would serve as a prologue to another game in the series, later revealed as Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It was the second game to utilize the Fox Engine after Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 the year before. In addition, Kojima confirmed that the length of the cutscenes would be reduced, as he believes that long cutscenes have become outdated. According to Famitsu, real dogs were used for motion capture during the development of the game's opening scenes, in addition to Konami confirming that part of Kojima's direction was influenced by AKB48 music videos, most notably the usage of sideways lens flares.Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain were originally supposed to be released together, but The Phantom Pain's long development time resulted in Kojima splitting the project into two parts to allow players to experience the gameplay of Metal Gear Solid V prior to the full game's release. Kojima compared Ground Zeroes with the pre-title sequence in a Hollywood movie due to how it will build up the plot from The Phantom Pain. Kojima claimed that his aim was to target taboos and mature themes, which he considered to be \"quite risky\", adding that his roles as creator and producer were in conflict with one another; as creator, Kojima wanted to take the risk of exploring themes that might alienate audiences, but as producer, he had to be able to tone down the content in order to sell as many copies of the game as possible. Ultimately, the role of creator won out, and Kojima described his approach as \"prioritising creativity over sales\". Kojima has described the connections and differences between Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain, stating that \"the advanced capabilities of the Fox Engine have allowed me to tell the new story in a new way\", and that \"there will be a significant difference in what The Phantom Pain brings to the series, so we want to ease players into the new open world environment and its potential\", hoping to achieve that with Ground Zeroes.The Japanese version of the game features an English text option, rendering in-game menus and subtitled dialogue in full English. This makes it possible to play the game with the Japanese voice cast accompanied by English text. Ground Zeroes is the first title in the series subtitled in Arabic, a feature the team had originally planned for previous games. The game also breaks away from the franchise's tradition of using licensed firearms and other military technology; instead, players use fictional weapons that bear little resemblance to real-life counterparts, such as the Marines' Type 69 rifle being reminiscent of the M-16.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She was armed with a main battery of eight 21 cm (8.3 in) guns, a significant increase in firepower over earlier German armored cruisers, and she had a top speed of 22.5 knots (42 km/h; 26 mph). Gneisenau initially served with the German fleet in I Scouting Group, though her service there was limited owing to the British development of the battlecruiser by 1909, which the less powerful armored cruisers could not effectively combat.\nAccordingly, Gneisenau was assigned to the German East Asia Squadron, where she joined her sister ship Scharnhorst. The two cruisers formed the core of the squadron, which included several light cruisers. Over the next four years, Gneisenau patrolled Germany's colonial possessions in Asia and the Pacific Ocean. She also toured foreign ports to show the flag and monitored events in China during the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, the East Asia Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, crossed the Pacific to the western coast of South America, stopping for Gneisenau and Scharnhorst to attack French Polynesia in the Bombardment of Papeete in September.\nAfter arriving off the coast of Chile, the East Asia Squadron encountered and defeated a British squadron at the Battle of Coronel; during the action, Gneisenau disabled the British armored cruiser HMS Monmouth, which was then sunk by the German light cruiser N\u00fcrnberg.

The completed hull was launched on 27 June 1945. She was commissioned at Tacoma on 4 December 1945, too late to have seen action during the war. Following her completion, she embarked on a shakedown cruise to test the ship along the West Coast of the United States, that lasted into January 1946; later that month, she departed for the East Coast of the United States, arriving in Norfolk, Virginia, on 15 February. Despite the fact that the United States was demobilizing much of the armed forces that had been assembled during the war, the newly completed Mindoro would be kept in active service.Mindoro was assigned to Carrier Division 14, which she soon joined for training exercises to practice carrier operations. In May, she sailed to the West Indies, where she took part in large scale maneuvers with ships from 8th Fleet. She spent the rest of the year cruising along the East Coast and as far south as Cuba; during this period, she conducted routine training exercises for her pilots and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises. In the postwar period, the Navy adopted a combined-arms approach to ASW defense for the fleet and the US coast; escort carriers like Mindoro formed hunter-killer groups, which were supported by patrol craft and blimps like the K class. The blimps frequently practiced joint operations with the escort carriers, including landing on the flight deck. She spent the next nine years operating on a similar routine of training exercises and fleet maneuvers, and she was based at Norfolk for this period. In November 1947, she took part in the Civilian Cruise Program, a public relations program the Navy had begun after the end of the war in 1945. George Whelan Anderson Jr. captained Mindoro beginning in July 1948.She also made trips across the Atlantic to visit Britain, and in 1950, she was sent on a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea for assignment with the 6th Fleet. During the deployment, Mindoro served as part of the ASW screen for the fleet. She also brought her escorting cruisers and destroyers, which further strengthened the fleet. The deployment was in response to the outbreak of the Korean War earlier in 1950; many warships from the 6th Fleet had been transferred to the Pacific to support operations in Korea, so Mindoro's ASW group was sent to reinforce the 6th Fleet. From 1951 to 1952, David L. McDonald served as the ship's commander. In September 1952, Mindoro took part in the major NATO naval exercise, Exercise Mainbrace, off Norway and Denmark. In 1954, she made a second deployment to the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet.The ship took part in her final training maneuvers off the Virginia Capes in January 1955, after which she sailed to Boston on the 17th.

It was the company's first independent design, and also Japan's first passenger car with a diesel engine. It was available as a four-door sedan and a five-door station wagon, called the Bellel Express. The Bellel Express was technically speaking a commercial vehicle, as was the custom in Japan at the time. The name \"Bellel\" resulted from combining the English word \"bell\" with the Roman numeral \"L\", equalling 50, and thus the name was supposed to represent \"fifty Bells\" (Isuzu literally means \"fifty bells\" in Japanese), and reflects a tradition within Isuzu of naming products that use terms that have special significance in Japan. Production began in time for the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo in October 1964, with initial release in select Japanese cities starting in April 1962.\n\nThe Bellel was fitted with 1.5 L and 2.0 L gasoline OHV engines with a Bosch licensed fuel injection system, and also the aforementioned 55 PS (40 kW) 2.0 L diesel (DL201) engine. The original diesel engine was called the DL200; it offered 52 PS (38 kW). All engines were mated with a four-speed manual transmission with the shifter mounted on the steering column. The suspension setup was modeled after the Hillman Minx, which was previously manufactured by Isuzu under a license agreement with the Rootes Group. The list of standard equipment expanded so that it could compete for sales against more popular products from more prolific Japanese  manufacturers, helping to justify the yearly road tax bill for using a large displacement engine, while remaining compliant with Japanese Government dimension regulations. As the private car ownership market in Japan began to grow, the Bellel was offered as an alternative to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric, and the Prince Gloria.\nThe original end treatment was updated in October 1965 in an attempt to afford the Bellel a more formal, upscale and mainstream look. The facelift included changes to the front fascia, where the previous single round headlights paired with smaller turn signals were replaced by quad round headlights arranged vertically.\n\nThe diesel engine - a first for a Japanese passenger car - made the Bellel popular for commercial applications, such as taxicab services. This partially helped to offset the Bellel's relative unpopularity with private customers, which resulted from the harshness of the early diesel engine and peculiar styling. A small number of these cars found their way into other countries, with the Bellel also offered with left-hand drive. 37,206 Bellels were manufactured in total (including the Express wagon/van), with production coming to an end in May 1967.

Shortly after the release of the Dream, developers discovered a software exploit which would allow a user to gain superuser access to the phone\u2014a process which would be referred to as \"rooting\". As a parallel to \"jailbreaking\" on iOS devices, root access would enable users to perform tweaks and other changes at the system level that cannot be performed under normal circumstances (such as adding auto-rotation, and installing a custom kernel that restored the aforementioned multitouch support).After the Dream's bootloader was dumped, work began on modifying it so that it could install third-party firmware, and on converting official Android update files into a format that could be installed using the modified bootloader. Around the same time, Google made the Android Dev Phone 1 available for registered Android developers; the Dev Phone 1 was a SIM- and hardware-unlocked version of the HTC Dream that came pre-configured for superuser access to the internal files of the phone, allowing users to completely replace the bootloader and operating system.As a result of these developments, a dedicated community, centered on forums such as XDA Developers, emerged surrounding the creation of custom firmware (\"ROMs\") built from the Android source code. Projects such as CyanogenMod continued to produce ports of newer versions of Android for the Dream and later Android devices, while adding their own features and enhancements to the operating system as well.On later Android devices, where a number of factors (including carrier practices, and custom software provided by device manufacturers that sit atop Android, such as HTC Sense and Samsung TouchWiz) led to fragmentation regarding the availability of newer versions of the OS for certain devices, the development and use of custom ROMs (which are usually based on the \"stock\" version of Android) have ultimately become an important, yet controversial aspect of the Android ecosystem. In August 2012, a group of users released an unofficial port of a later version of Android, 4.1 \"Jelly Bean\", for the Dream as a proof of concept.

Although the USAF had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs, the program was cut to 187 production aircraft in 2009 due to high costs, a lack of air-to-air missions at the time of production, and the development of the more affordable and versatile F-35. The last aircraft was delivered in 2012. After a protracted development and initial operational difficulties, the F-22 became a critical component of the USAF's tactical airpower and will remain a cornerstone of the fighter fleet until its succession by the crewed Next Generation Air Dominance fighter.", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "176_366", "question": "Which company is Boeing KC-46 produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_57198", "text": "The KC-46 Pegasus is a variant of the Boeing 767 and is a widebody, low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional empennage featuring a single fin and rudder. It has a retractable tricycle landing gear and a hydraulic flight control system. The Pegasus is powered by two Pratt & Whitney PW4062 engines, one mounted under each wing. It has been described as combining \"the 767-200ER's fuselage, with the 767-300F's wing, gear, cargo door and floor, with the 767-400ER digital flightdeck and flaps\". The KC-46 uses a similar Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) to that implicated in two 737 MAX crashes; in March 2019, the USAF began reviewing KC-46 training due to this feature. Unlike the 737, the KC-46's MCAS takes input from dual redundant angle of attack sensors and disengages with stick input by the pilot.The flightdeck has room for a crew of four with a forward crew compartment with seats for 15 crew members and in the rear fuselage either palletized passenger seating for 58, or 18 pallets in cargo configuration. The rear compartment can also be used in an aero-medical configuration for 54 patients (24 on litters). Quick ingress from the ground is available via a ladder that can be pulled down near the front landing gear. The KC-46A can carry 212,299 lb (96,297 kg) of fuel, 10 percent more than the KC-135, and 65,000 lb (29,000 kg) of cargo. Survivability is improved with infrared countermeasures and the aircraft has limited electronic warfare capabilities. It uses manual flight controls, allowing unrestricted maneuverability to avoid threats anywhere in the flight envelope.\nAt the rear of the KC-46 is a fly-by-wire refueling boom supplemented by wing air refueling pods at each wingtip and a centerline drogue system under the rear fuselage so it can handle both types of refueling in one mission. The boom includes a hydraulic relief valve system, similar to those on the KC-10 and KC-767 tankers, to relieve axial pressure in the event of excessive loads building up on the boom. In order to address the stiff boom issue, which keeps a KC-46 from refueling lightweight, thrust-limited receivers like the A-10, Boeing is replacing the current actuator with one using a pressure-flow PQ valve in the 2023 time frame.Rather than using a single boom operator seated or prone at the tail looking out a window, the Aerial Refueling Operator Station (AROS) seats two operators at the front of the tanker. AROS includes three main displays for each operator to display images from multiple multi-spectral cameras distributed around the aircraft. The central 2D/3D display provides a rear-facing view for boom refueling operations. Boom operators can execute their mission in total darkness with both aircraft blacked out. The hybrid 2D-3D system requires stereoscopic glasses to be fully effective.The Remote Vision System (RVS) that feeds video to the AROS has been problematic, motion viewed in the RVS versus which can create a depth compression and curvature effect. Blackouts and washouts on the displays during refueling, caused by shadows or direct sunlight are a problem that will be fixed by the RVS 2.0 upgrade along with depth perception issues via the use of new cameras and a full-color high-definition screen. Experienced boom operators of older tankers still prefer the KC-46, even with its current drawbacks.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The company was co-founded by Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson in 1957. Olsen was president until he was forced to resign in 1992, after the company had gone into precipitous decline.\nThe company produced many different product lines over its history. It is best known for the work in the minicomputer market starting in the mid-1960s. The company produced a series of machines known as the PDP line, with the PDP-8 and PDP-11 being among the most successful minis in history. Their success was only surpassed by another DEC product, the late-1970s VAX \"supermini\" systems that were designed to replace the PDP-11. Although a number of competitors had successfully competed with Digital through the 1970s, the VAX cemented the company's place as a leading vendor in the computer space.\nAs microcomputers improved in the late 1980s, especially with the introduction of RISC-based workstation machines, the performance niche of the minicomputer was rapidly eroded. By the early 1990s, the company was in turmoil as their mini sales collapsed and their attempts to address this by entering the high-end market with machines like the VAX 9000 were market failures. After several attempts to enter the workstation and file server market, the DEC Alpha product line began to make successful inroads in the mid-1990s, but was too late to save the company.\nDEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. During the purchase, some parts of DEC were sold to other companies; the compiler business and the Hudson Fab were sold to Intel. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own.

Three of the five patients with listeria died.Despite a series of subsequent recalls, and the temporary shutdown of its Broken Arrow plant, \"an enhanced sampling program\" launched by Blue Bell produced \"several positive tests for Listeria in different places and plants\", including three further cases in Texas. As a result, on the evening of April 20, 2015, the company took precautionary measures and expanded its recall to cover all of its products leading to the disposal of over eight million gallons of product in a sanitary landfill.At the same time, the company shut down production and commenced cleanup and repair operations at its manufacturing facilities. The FDA found that the company failed to follow standard practices to prevent contamination; two years prior to the recalls, the company \"repeatedly found listeria\" in its Broken Arrow facility. At its main production facility in Brenham, one of its production machines (which produced most of the recalled products) was so contaminated that Blue Bell announced it would permanently stop using the machine, and condensation was also reported in parts of the Brenham facility.Although a spokeswoman for Blue Bell had previously demurred on the subject of job losses, on May 15, Blue Bell announced a series of job cuts and furloughs. 1,450 (or 37 percent) of the company's employees would be laid off, while another 1,400 employees were furloughed until cleanup/repair operations concluded, and the remaining 1,050 involved in essential operations and cleanup/repair operations had wage reductions imposed on them.In addition, due to limited supply and distribution capabilities expected in the near term, Blue Bell announced it would suspend operations at 15 of its over 50 distribution centers indefinitely, though it has not ruled out returning to these markets eventually.

It was the company's first airliner.The Argosy was developed during the early-to-mid 1920s in response to a statement by Imperial Airways that new multi-engined airliners were being sought to replace its single-engined counterparts then in use. Armstrong Whitworth proposed a relatively large biplane airliner, powered by three Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar engines; its construction largely composed of plywood and fabric supported by steel tubing. Imperial Airways opted to initially order a pair of aircraft to serve its European routes, while the Air Ministry ordered a single example as well. On 16 March 1926, the first Argosy, G-EBLF, performed its maiden flight.\nFollowing the delivery of the second aircraft to Imperial Airways, the Argosy performed its first passenger flight on 16 July 1926, flying from London to Paris. Using the type, Imperial Airways inaugurated the world's first named air service, the luxury 'Silver Wing' service, between these two cities. The type would be operated by the airline for nine years, during which time a total of three Argosies would be lost in accidents, although only one of these resulted in fatalities. During 1935, Imperial Airways opted to retire all remaining aircraft in favour of the next generation of airliners, which were larger and equipped with four engines instead.

The new lineup includes three optional engines for the conventional four-cylinder-only gasoline model, a next-generation hybrid version, and a plug-in hybrid version, the Ford Fusion Energi. The Ford Fusion became the first production sedan to offer these three powertrain options. In April 2012 Ford announced that an auto start-stop system will be available for the 1.6-liter EcoBoost engine non-hybrid version, at a price of US$295. The expected fuel economy was a combined 37 mpg\u2011US (6.4 L/100 km; 44 mpg\u2011imp). Sales of the gasoline-powered and hybrid version began in the U.S. in October 2012.Sales in Europe and Asia, under the Ford Mondeo name, were planned to start in 2013. Ford began taking orders of the Mondeo Hybrid in Germany in August 2014. Production of the Mondeo Hybrid began at Ford's Valencia, Spain, plant in November 2014.The nickel-metal hydride batteries used in the hybrid first generation were replaced with lithium-ion batteries. The 2013 model year Fusion Hybrid is more fuel efficient than its predecessor, with a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rating of 42 mpg\u2011US (5.6 L/100 km; 50 mpg\u2011imp) combined, 44 mpg\u2011US (5.3 L/100 km; 53 mpg\u2011imp) in city and 41 mpg\u2011US (5.7 L/100 km; 49 mpg\u2011imp) in highway driving. Initially, the second generation Fusion Hybrid was rated 47 mpg\u2011US (5.0 L/100 km; 56 mpg\u2011imp) with the same rating for combined/city/highway cycles. However, in June 2014 Ford announced that it was downgrading the EPA fuel economy ratings on six of its 2013 and 2014 model year vehicles, including all its C-Max, Fusion and MKZ full hybrids and its two plug-in Energi models. The ratings were lowered after an error was discovered in the company's internal testing data. Ford is making a goodwill payments to around 200,000 customers affected by its mistake. After the ratings were lowered the 2013/14 Fusion Hybrid still slightly outperforms the 2012/2014 Toyota Camry Hybrid LE by 1 mpg-US city and 2 mpg-US highway, and the Camry XLE by 4 mpg-US city and 3 mpg-US highway.\nThe second generation hybrid has a powertrain with a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle inline-four \u2013 downsized from the 2.5-liter unit used in the first generation Fusion Hybrid. Total output is estimated at 185 hp (138 kW) and 130 ft\u22c5lb (180 N\u22c5m), running to the front wheels via an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission. The lithium-ion battery pack saves weight and generates more power than previous NiMH batteries, and allows the second generation Fusion Hybrid to raise its maximum speed under electric-only power from 47 to 62 mph (76 to 100 km/h).The 2013 Fusion Hybrid includes driver assistance and technologies based on sensors, cameras and radar that enable the car to see and respond.

At a time when the luxury car market had been driven into freefall by a combination of government taxation policy and the depressed state of the postwar economy, the VLR was critical in keeping alive the company that produced it during the early 1950s.\n\u201cVLR\u201d stood for \u00ab V\u00e9hicule l\u00e9ger de reconnaissance \u00bb (light reconnaissance vehicle).   The name \u00ab VLRD \u00bb V\u00e9hicule l\u00e9ger de reconnaissance Delahaye\u00bb is also sometimes used.\nThe vehicle featured a light metal ohc four-cylinder water-cooled engine of (initially) 1,995 cc and, by the standards of the time, a sophisticated suspension system.   The four-speed gear box featured synchromesh on all four speeds.During the second half of 1950 the French army tested it extensively and declared themselves impressed.   With only very minor modifications, they homologated the VLR for army use and placed an order for slightly more than 4,000.   The company's postwar production model, the Delahaye 175 had fared disastrously in the marketplace, with just 521 produced between 1947 and 1950, so the military order secured for the VLR was more than welcome.\nThe army were impressed by the performance of the vehicle both on and off-road, and the company was encouraged to try to sell VLRs into the civilian market.   Civilian-market models were hard to distinguish from the military ones, but the 24-volt electrical system upon which  the military had insisted was replaced, in the civilian VLRs, by a more conventional (for the time and vehicle's size) 12-volt electrical system.   The VLR's civil-market price of above one and a half million francs was considered expensive (though much lower than the prices asked for the company's luxury passenger cars), and its mechanical complexity made it an unattractive proposition other than for rich owner-mechanics.   It is worth bearing in mind that in the aftermath of a massive European war there were at this time a large number of second-hand Jeeps competing for the attention of anyone thinking to buy a civilian version of a VRC. Almost all of the 9,621 VLRs sold between 1951 and 1955 were accordingly sold to the military.   Production was halted in March 1954, but vehicles were still being delivered in 1955.It was said that the mechanical complexity of the vehicle, which excited much comment in the press and was blamed for its lack of sales success on the civilian market, was not seen as a problem by the army.   Nevertheless, by the mid-1950s the army had switched to the mechanically simpler Jeep, then being assembled in France by Hotchkiss under Willys license as the Hotchkiss M201. The Delahaye business itself was taken over by Hotchkiss in 1954, after which VLR production seems to have been quickly stopped.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The basic concept was to allow US strategic bombers to launch their weapons from well outside the range of Soviet defenses, as much as 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from their targets. To do this in an air-launched form, a lightweight thermonuclear warhead was needed. Initially, the W47 from the Polaris missile was selected, but it was later replaced by the W59 from the Minuteman missile.\nThe UK joined the Skybolt program in 1960, intending to use it on their V bomber force. When the design added a star tracker in addition to its inertial navigation system (INS) this meant that it could only be carried externally where the tracker could see the sky. This requirement along with the required ground clearance on takeoff limited it to the Avro Vulcan bomber. Several design decisions in the W47 led the RAF to question its safety, so they intended to use their own Red Snow warheads. This was a heavier warhead and would reduce the range to about 600 miles (970 km), meaning the bombers would have to cross the Soviet coastline to attack Moscow.\nTesting began in 1962 and was initially marked by a string of failures. These failures, along with a lack of mission after the successful development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), led to its cancellation in December 1962. The UK had decided to base its entire 1960s deterrent force on Skybolt, and its cancellation led to a major disagreement between the UK and US, known today as the \"Skybolt Crisis\". This was resolved by a series of meetings that led to the Royal Navy gaining the UGM-27 Polaris missile and construction of the Resolution-class submarines to launch them.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Its ISO film speed equivalents range from 100 - 1600.  The S2 Pro also has sound recording capability. The camera is no longer in production, having been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro in February 2004.\nAside from the Nikon lens mount, the camera's principal distinction is its 6.17 megapixel photo sensor. Known as the Super CCD, it is unique in having its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other DSLR cameras. This allows the use of a sophisticated interpolation system that produces an output image equivalent to 12.1 megapixels. The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lies somewhere between 6.17 megapixels and the 12.1 megapixel interpolated output.\nA huge number of these cameras were built using a Sony sourced defective CCD that was subject to a recall by Fuji.

{"id": "176_430", "question": "Which company is Sega Master System produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_57425", "text": "Master System games came in two formats: ROM cartridges held up to 4 Mbit (512 KB) of code and data, while Sega Cards held up to 256 Kbit (32 KB). Cartridges were marketed by their storage size: One Mega (1 Mbit), Two Mega (2 Mbit), and Four Mega (4 Mbit). Cards, cheaper to manufacture than the cartridges, included Spy vs. Spy and Super Tennis, but were eventually dropped due to their small memory size. The size of the release library varies based on region; North America received just over 100 games, with Japan receiving less. Europe, by contrast, received over 300 licensed games, including 8-bit ports of Genesis games and PAL-exclusive releases. The first Mark III-specific cartridge was Fantasy Zone, released on June 15, 1986, and Bomber Raid was the final release on February 4, 1989, a few months after the launch of the Mega Drive. The final North American release was Sonic the Hedgehog in October 1991. Games for PAL regions continued to be released until the mid-1990s.The Sega Mark III and the Japanese Master System are backwards-compatible with SC-3000/SG-1000 cartridges, and can play Sega Card games without the Card Catcher peripheral. However, educational and programming cartridges for the SC-3000 require the SK-1100 keyboard peripheral, which is compatible with the Mark III but not the Japanese Master System. Mark III-specific games were initially available in card format (labelled My Card Mark III to distinguish themselves from games designed for the SC-3000/SG-1000), starting with Teddy Boy Blues and Hang-On, both released on October 20, 1985.Of the games released for the Master System, Phantasy Star is considered a benchmark role-playing game (RPG), and became a successful franchise. Sega's flagship character at the time, Alex Kidd, featured in games including Alex Kidd in Miracle World. Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap was influential for its blend of platform gameplay with RPG elements. Different Master System consoles included built-in games, including Snail Maze, Hang-On/Safari Hunt, Alex Kidd in Miracle World and Sonic the Hedgehog. Battery-backup save game support was included in eight cartridges, including Penguin Land, Phantasy Star, Ys, and Miracle Warriors.The more extensive PAL region library includes 8-bit entries in Genesis franchises such as Streets of Rage, a number of additional Sonic the Hedgehog games, and dozens of PAL exclusives such as Lucky Dime Caper, Asterix, Ninja Gaiden, Master of Darkness and Power Strike II. Retro Gamer's Damien McFerran praised the \"superb\" PAL library of \"interesting ports and excellent exclusives\", which was richer than the North American library and provided a \"drip-feed of quality titles\".After the Master System was discontinued in other markets, additional games were released in Brazil by Tectoy, including ports of Street Fighter II and Dynamite Headdy. Tectoy created Portuguese translations of games exclusive to the region. Some of these would tie in to popular Brazilian entertainment franchises; for example, Teddy Boy became Geraldinho, certain Wonder Boy titles became Monica's Gang games, and Ghost House became Chapolim vs. Dracula: Um Duelo Assutador, based on the Mexican TV series El Chapul\u00edn Colorado. Tectoy also ported games to the Master System, including various games from the Genesis and Game Gear. Aside from porting, the company developed F\u00e9rias Frustradas do Pica-Pau after finding out that Woody Woodpecker (named Pica-Pau in Portuguese) was the most popular cartoon on Brazilian television, along with at least twenty additional exclusives. These titles were developed in-house by Tectoy in Brazil.Due in part to Nintendo's licensing practices, which stipulated that third-party NES developers could not release games on other platforms, few third-party developers released games for the Master System. According to Sato, Sega was focused on porting its arcade games instead of building relationships with third parties. According to Sega designer Mark Cerny, most of Sega's early Master System games were developed within a strict three-month deadline, which affected their quality. Computer Gaming World compared new Sega games to \"drops of water in the desert\". Games for the Master System took advantage of more advanced hardware compared to the NES; Alex Kidd in Miracle World, for example, showcases \"blistering colors and more detailed sprites\" than NES games. The Master System version of R-Type was praised for its visuals, comparable to those of the TurboGrafx-16 port.In 2005, Sega reached a deal with Chinese company AtGames to release emulated Master System software in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. Several Master System games were released for download on Nintendo's Wii Virtual Console, beginning with Fist of the North Star in 2008 in Japan and Wonder Boy in North America.

It was originally produced in 15.1 mm caliber from 1940, with a 15\u00d796mm cartridge, but due to demand for higher effect against aircraft, especially with the introduction of mine shells for the 20 mm MG-FF/M aircraft cannon, the design was rechambered to 20 mm caliber in 1941, using a newly developed 20\u00d782mm cartridge which traded projectile velocity for explosive power. The initial 15 mm variant then became known as the MG 151/15, with the new 20 mm variant becoming the MG 151/20.\nThe MG 151/20 cannon was widely used on German Luftwaffe combat aircraft throughout World War II, mainly as offensive armament, but also seeing some use as defensive guns. Existing MG 151/15 guns saw use as aircraft armament throughout the war, albeit more limited compared to the MG 151/20, but also as anti-aircraft guns in various configurations, such as the SdKfz 251/21 Drilling half-track which carried three MG 151/15.\nPost-war, salvaged MG 151/20 saw usage by many nations. France had salvaged many guns and became the main user and exporter of the MG 151/20 during the Cold War, fitting it to not only aircraft, but also armoured fighting vehicles as anti aircraft weaponry. France continued exporting the gun all the way into the 1960s, then primarily as flexible dorsal gunship armament for the A\u00e9rospatiale SA-3160 and SA-3164 Alouette III  utility helicopter. SA-3160s armed with MG 151/20s were bought by Portugal, Rhodesia and South Africa in 1966 and saw service until the early 1990s.

With an emphasis on greater fuel efficiency over turbojets for longer range, the 12.5 tonnes-force (122.6 kN; 27,560 lbf) class turbofan engine was intended to power the heavy PFI (Russian: \u041f\u0424\u0418, short for: \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f, lit.\u2009'Promising Frontline Fighter'), which was being developed by Sukhoi as the T-10. The chief designer was Arkhip M. Lyulka, and after his death, Victor M. Chepkin. As the AL-31 was not yet ready for the first two T-10 prototypes in 1977, they were initially powered by modified AL-21F3 turbojet engines. The third prototype would be the first to install the AL-31. The T-10 design would be heavily revised into the T-10S, with T-10-7 being the first prototype of the improved design; the aircraft's aerodynamic refinements from changes in the outer shaping and packaging also resulted in the AL-31 gearbox changing to a top-mounted position. State tests of the AL-31 were completed in 1985, and the T-10 entering Soviet air services as the Su-27. The engine is manufactured at Ufa-based UMPO and Moscow-based Salyut.After the collapse of the Soviet Union, design bureau and production plant distinctions realigned and gradually faded, and Lyulka-Saturn eventually merged with Rybinsk Motors to become NPO Saturn and was closely aligned with UMPO while Salyut became an independent entity; both Saturn and Salyut would make their own developments for the AL-31 family. Salyut also supplies AL-31 variants to fighters operated by the China. The J-10 uses the AL-31FN before newer variants transitioned to the domestic WS-10A, while the J-20 uses the AL-31FM2 as an interim engine until its intended WS-15 is ready. This reorganization would result in serious disputes between Saturn and Salyut over intellectual property rights and royalties over AL-31 sales to China.The AL-31 was also used to assist Chinese engine designer and manufacturer Shenyang/Liming in developing the WS-10, with early examples directly using the AL-31F control system. According to Saturn's Victor M. Chepkin, chief designer of the 117 and 117S engines, the WS-10 was developed with the aid of the AL-31's maintenance technical documentation; this was recently confirmed by Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), the parent of Shenyang Aircraft Corporation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This was achieved through the use of high-tech and expensive materials such as carbon fibre, titanium, kevlar, magnesium and gold. The F1 was the first production car to use a carbon-fibre monocoque chassis.\nGordon Murray had been thinking of a three-seat sports car since his youth. When Murray was waiting for a flight home from the Italian Grand Prix in 1988, he drew a sketch of a three-seater sports car and proposed it to Ron Dennis. He pitched the idea of creating the ultimate road car, a concept that would be heavily influenced by the company's Formula One experience and technology and thus reflect that skill and knowledge through the McLaren F1.\nMurray declared that \"During this time, we were able to visit Honda's Tochigi Research Centre with Ayrton Senna. The visit related to the fact that at the time, Honda powered McLaren's F1 Grand Prix chassis. Although it's true I had thought it would have been better to put a larger engine, the moment I drove the Honda NSX, all the benchmark cars\u2014Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini\u2014I had been using as references in the development of my car vanished from my mind. Of course, the car we would create, the McLaren F1, needed to be faster than the NSX, but the NSX's ride quality and handling would become our new design target. Being a fan of Honda engines, I later went to Honda's Tochigi Research Centre on two occasions and requested that they consider building for the McLaren F1 a 4.5-litre V10 or V12. I asked, I tried to persuade them, but in the end could not convince them to do it, and the McLaren F1 ended up equipped with a BMW engine.\"A pair of Ultima MK3 kit cars, chassis numbers 12 and 13, \"Albert\" and \"Edward\", the last two MK3s, were used as \"mules\" to test various components and concepts before the first cars were built. Number 12 was used to test the gearbox with a 7.4-litre Chevrolet V8, plus various other components such as the seats and the brakes. Number 13 was the test of the V12, plus the exhaust and cooling system. When McLaren was done with the cars they destroyed both of them to keep away the specialist magazines and because they did not want the car to be associated with \"kit cars\".The car was first unveiled at a launch show, on 28 May 1992, at The Sporting Club in Monaco. The production version remained the same as the original prototype (XP1) except for the wing mirror which, on the XP1, was mounted at the top of the A-pillar. This car was deemed not road legal as it had no indicators at the front; McLaren was forced to make changes to the car as a result (some cars, including Ralph Lauren's, were sent back to McLaren and fitted with the prototype mirrors). The original wing mirrors also incorporated a pair of indicators which other car manufacturers would adopt several years later.\nThe car's safety levels were first proved when during a testing in Namibia in April 1993, a test driver wearing just shorts and a T-shirt hit a rock and rolled the first prototype car several times. The driver managed to escape unscathed. Later in the year, the second prototype (XP2) was specially built for crash testing and passed with the front wheel arch untouched.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This event raised awareness about the effectiveness of such weapons and prompted the development of similar systems in Western countries, such as the Harpoon in the United States. However, it is unknown whether the Otomat program started before or after the Eilat event.The Otomat program was undertaken by the Italian Oto Melara corporation in cooperation with the French Matra Corporation. The aim was to develop an anti-ship missile powered by a turbofan which would allow more range and a heavier warhead than rocket-powered missiles then being developed in Europe such as the French Exocet and the German Kormoran. Trials started in 1971 and development of the Mk1 version of the Otomat officially ended in 1974.However, at that time, the French Navy chose the wholly French Exocet over the Franco-Italian Otomat as its standard anti-ship missile. Thus, the Italian Navy remained as the only launch customer for the missile; it entered service in January 1976, before the commissioning of the warship intended to carry it, the Lupo-class frigate. These early Otomat missiles lacked a data link for over-the-horizon targeting, which limited its effective range to 60 kilometres (37 mi) a similar figure to the Exocet. To solve this problem, development of an Mk2 version started in May 1973, with a first test launch in January 1974, development completed in 1976, and the first over-the-horizon launch in 1978. By the end of 1976 OTO Melara had reported that 210 Otomats had been sold: Italy 48, Peru 40, Venezuela 12, and Libya 110. Also at this time there were negotiations under way for the sale of 296 more missiles to various nations (i.e. Italy 48, Egypt 30, Venezuela 48, Libya 120, Indonesia 50).A Mk2 Block II version was introduced in the 1980s, it featured folding wings so that the missile could now fit in a smaller launch box. This reduction in size allowed a doubling in the number of missiles carried, usually from four to eight. Even so, Otomat Mk2 Block II remained bulkier than contemporary versions of Harpoon and Exocet missiles due to its greater diameter and its boosters being fitted to its flanks instead of in the rear.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Eber Brock Ward, a wealthy steamboat owner from Detroit, Michigan, who organized the Detroit Copper Mining Co with Miles Joy as manager.  Ward died January 2, 1875, in Detroit before substantial work began.  His managers did patent the richest claims, the Arizona Central, Copper Mountain, Montezuma, and Yankee.\nIn the late 1870s William Church, a mine speculator from Denver, Colorado, negotiated the purchase of the company stock.  Church became the true father of the camp.  . With a loan from the partners in Phelps, Dodge, during 1882 he erected furnaces, opened the mines, and began shipping copper east. As a reflection of frontier conditions of the times, he was attacked by Apaches at his smelter in 1882, and twice robbed at gunpoint in his office during the early 1880s.  On the advice of Dr. James Douglas (businessman), consultant for Phelps Dodge, the smelter was relocated from the San Francisco River to the mines. The first concentrator was built and a \"baby\" gauge railroad connected the DCC mines with the transport system of the neighboring Arizona Copper Company, which connected to the transcontinental Southern Pacific Railroad. Church had made his DCC into one of the early, respectable copper operations in the territory. In 1897, he sold his 55% interests in the DCC to Phelps Dodge for a reported $800,000, retired to his stone mansion in Denver's capitol hill neighborhood, and earned a reputation as philanthropist and real estate baron.James Douglas became president and general manager of the operation for Phelps Dodge, which increased the DCC capital stock from $500,000 to one million dollars, and over the next four years greatly expanded DCC operations with a new rail connection, concentrator, and improved, rebuilt smelter. Metallurgist and Douglas protege, Dr. L.D. Ricketts designed the 600 ton Yankee concentrator, one of the most innovative of the time, and the first of many modern, ever enlarging plants built in the district (steel beams with iron sheeting, Wilfley tables, vanners and jigs for gravity concentration, which could work ores under 3% copper). The Morenci Southern narrow gauge railroad, completed in 1901, connected the mines via five loops over itself in the 18 miles of rails down the mountainside to a junction with the New Mexico & Arizona line. A network of \"baby\" gauge railroad tracks connected the mine works, plants, and the Morenci Southern. Under Dr. Douglas, the smelter was rebuilt with five blast furnaces and Bessemer converters which produced a purer copper for the market. At its peak, Detroit Copper Co. consisted of 145 mining claims at Morenci.Detroit Copper Co. founded the town of Morenci (originally named Joy's camp after Ward's first local manager) to supply housing and services to workers employed by the company. After a devastating fire in 1897, Morenci was relocated three quarters of a mile down the canyon. DCC managers organized the Morenci Improvement Company to help rebuild the town and construct better housing. In time, DCC or the improvement company owned a large store, a hotel, and considerable amounts of additional property in the town of Morenci. DCC also funded a free public library, gymnasium and improved schools for workers and their families. At the beginning of the twentieth century the town of Morenci had distinctive southwestern architecture, with Spanish mission style and rustic stone buildings used by the company around a central camp plaza. (The original \"Hell's Half Acre\" of saloons and brothels were re-built away from the plaza). DCC also established a water pumping plant on the San Francisco River seven miles away. The nearby smelter town of Clifton was settled to provide additional housing, and eventually eclipsed the camp becoming Greenlee county seat.The company employed mostly Mexican miners, who were paid about half what Caucasian miners earned. During the Church era, Mexican miners were paid with company script, or paper \"boletas, which could only be spent at the company store, a base for contention between miners and the company. The boleta system was eased out after the DCC was acquired by Phelps Dodge. As with many mines in Arizona and New Mexico at the time, the Detroit Copper Co. saw several waves of labor union organizing as well as strikes from 1900 onward. DCC used labor spies to infiltrate nascent unions and stop organizing campaigns.A significant problem in early copper camps were disputes over ownership of ore bodies based on the 1872 Mining Law's \"rule of the apex.\" This was defined where the company which owned the apex (or outcrop) of an ore body could mine ore across mine claim boundaries following vein \"dips, spurs, and angles\u201d. Church was able to avoid a potential lawsuit with neighboring claim holders by agreeing to ignore the rule of the apex and use British common law, whereby the companies extracted ore from only within their claim boundaries. In May 1882, Church's company agreed to co-develop the \"Detroit lode\" with the Longfellow Copper Mining Company (later purchased by the Arizona Copper Company). Although federal and state law provided that the company which accessed the lode had the right to develop the entire deposit, Detroit Copper lacked the capital to do so and agreed to permit Longfellow Copper to mine the lode as well, up to their agreed claim boundaries. This shift away from the rule of the apex to common law was followed later in other Arizona copper districts, most notably at Bisbee, Arizona.After the 1917 reorganization of the Phelps Dodge & Co holding company into the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the Detroit Copper Company ceased to exist. The operation was then known as \"Phelps Dodge Corporation, Morenci Branch.\" In 1921, Phelps Dodge acquired the mines of the adjacent Arizona Copper Company, Ltd, creating a world class copper operation, which is now one of the largest copper producers in the United States.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Noble M15 was intended to appeal to a far broader market and compete directly with the Porsche 911 Turbo and Ferrari F430. As a result, the Noble M15 was expected to have a number of features not previously found on Nobles such as satnav, traction control, electric windows and ABS. The company issued a press release about the M15, stating that the M15 will be produced after the introduction of the M600. The M15 of the future will be different than the car shown in 2006.\nDespite increased comfort and usability compared to previous Noble cars press releases stated that Noble expected the M15 to be significantly quicker than the M400 around a race track. It is able to accelerate from 0\u201360 mph (0\u201397 km/h) in 3.3 seconds and has a top speed of 185 mph (298 km/h).The car was based on a brand new platform with a longitudinally mounted engine connected to a bespoke gearbox created by Graziano. The double wishbone suspension is a development of the system mounted on the M400. Mounting the engine longitudinally allowed the designer to increase cooling flow to the engine which allows the 3.0L twin turbo V6 to produce 455 bhp (339 kW; 461 PS). The engine was designed to meet emissions regulations and the new steel/aluminium space frame was designed with a view to passing crash test regulations around the world. The M15 was planned to be the first Noble to gain European and US Type Approval.\nAccording to founder Lee Noble, \"I wanted to produce a supercar people could use every day. It was time for Noble to take a big step up in terms of refinement, practicality and style.\"The M15 appeared in Top Gear and presenter Richard Hammond was very impressed. It was a lot quicker around the Top Gear track than the old Noble. According to Richard this has to do with the new, stronger gearbox which enables Noble to allow more boost and let the same engine produce more power. The Stig managed a lap time of 1:22.5 which is currently 50th on the power lap board.", "hasanswer": false}]}

During the twentieth century, it was mostly concentrated on activities such as track maintenance, line construction, and urban transport services.During 2000, SECO was acquired by the road construction company Colas Group. Whilst its activities has been historically centred around France, the company also operated subsidiaries in both the UK and Belgium. Amongst its achievements in the British market was its involvement in the construction of High Speed 1, having provided the detailed detail, supply, and installation of 46 miles of track, overhead electrification, and other systems during the first phase of the project.During 2006, it became a train operator, initially focusing on the transportation of aggregates. In the following year, Colas became responsible for the Kronospan timber trains from Carlisle to Chirk, which was previously in the hands of AMEC-Spie and subsequently became Colas' first regular freight contract; it was operated using hired-in locomotives. Also during 2007, Colas purchased three Class 47 diesel locomotives from the freight operator England Wales Scotland (EWS); all three were overhauled at Eastleigh Works ahead of commencing operations in September 2007 on railhead treatment trains in South West England on behalf of the national rail infrastructure owner Network Rail.\nIn January 2008, Colas Group also acquired the Plant division of Carillion Rail, comprising 12 tampers, three regulators, one locomotive, one 125T Kirow Crane, 16 switch-handling units (Pem/Lem), and the freehold of the Mill Lane Plant Depot in Rugby, making the company the owner of the largest fleet of modern on-track plant in the UK. Accordingly, the company decided to reorganise its rail operations, during which Seco Rail was merged with both Carillion Rail and another recently-purchased rail subsidiary, AMEC-Spie; the new entity operated under the Colas Rail brand.\nDuring late 2008, Colas Rail commenced operating steel trains from Immingham to Washwood Heath, hauled by Class 56 locomotives hired from Hanson Traction. In mid-2009, on behalf of a separate customer, it commenced a further steel flow from Burton upon Trent to Dollands Moor, which was hauling by the company's own Class 47s.In late 2009, Colas leased four Class 66 (66 841\u201366 844) diesel locomotives that had last been used by the collapsed operator Advenza Freight. These were joined by 66 845 which had last been used by Direct Rail Services. As a consequence of their owners concluding a deal to lease all five locomotives to the British freight operator GB Railfreight, Colas purchased five replacement locomotives (66 846\u201366 850, formerly 66 573- 66 577) that had previously been operated by Freightliner. This rolling stock rearrangement coincided with Colas' entering of the UK coal haulage market during the summer of 2011.\nDuring December 2011, Colas launched a new service on behalf of Kronospan, moving timber from Gloucester to Newton Abbot, typically hauled by its Class 66 fleet. In late 2012, a single Class 86 electric locomotive (86 701) was briefly operated by the company on a trial service on the West Coast Main Line, hauling former First Great Western Motorail wagons; two years later, a similar trial service was conducted using a Class 60 locomotive instead.During April 2012, Colas purchased four Class 56 locomotives. By January 2014, the company had a total of 11 members of the type in its inventory. During May 2012, it also purchased the Pullman Rail rolling stock maintenance business based in Cardiff.In April 2013, Colas formed a joint venture with the British transport conglomerate Go-Ahead Group to bid for the concession to operate the Docklands Light Railway franchise, and was successfully short-listed during the competitive bidding process. However, during August 2013, it was announced that the bid had been withdrawn.\nIn November 2013, Colas placed an order for ten Class 70 diesel locomotives with the American railway manufacturer GE Transportation. Around the same time, it separately purchased four Class 37 locomotives formerly in preservation to return them to mainline operations.During 2014, Colas Rail purchased ten Class 60 locomotives from DB Schenker, the deal included an option to purchase a further ten at a later date. In mid-2015, it made preparations to commence operating infrastructure trains on behalf of Network Rail; as a part of these preparations, a further four Class 37s were purchased by Colas to haul them. By late 2016, Colas Rail was amongst the five largest contractors to Network Rail, and had 1,500 staff in the UK alone.In December 2017, Colas Rail sold its three Class 47 locomotives to GB Railfreight, as they had been deemed to be no longer useful to its core operations. During July 2018, it also sold all ten of its Class 60 locomotives to GB Railfreight.During the 2010s, Colas Rail was active as the primary contractor for the Al Boraq Moroccan high speed rail line, being responsible for the delivery of the railway infrastructure. It was also one of several contractors that were engaged in major improvement works at London Waterloo station during the mid-to-late 2010s. The company has also been involved in delivering enhancements to the West Midlands Metro. Colas Rail was also one of the companies involved in delivering the Contournement N\u00eemes \u2013 Montpellier French high speed line. It has also stated its interest in, and has advocated for, the High Speed 2 project.In 2018, Colas Rail publicly called for Network Rail to provide greater certainty on future rail freight paths, stating that investment in new services, such as rail-based parcel traffic, was being jeopardised by a lack of safeguards on capacity.During August 2021, Colas announced the sale of its Pullman Rail engineering operation to the government-owned not-for-profit organisation Transport for Wales.In February 2022, it conducted a trial service hauling timber from Devon to Monmouthshire on behalf of Euroforest Ltd.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Eber Brock Ward, a wealthy steamboat owner from Detroit, Michigan, who organized the Detroit Copper Mining Co with Miles Joy as manager.  Ward died January 2, 1875, in Detroit before substantial work began.  His managers did patent the richest claims, the Arizona Central, Copper Mountain, Montezuma, and Yankee.\nIn the late 1870s William Church, a mine speculator from Denver, Colorado, negotiated the purchase of the company stock.  Church became the true father of the camp.  . With a loan from the partners in Phelps, Dodge, during 1882 he erected furnaces, opened the mines, and began shipping copper east. As a reflection of frontier conditions of the times, he was attacked by Apaches at his smelter in 1882, and twice robbed at gunpoint in his office during the early 1880s.  On the advice of Dr. James Douglas (businessman), consultant for Phelps Dodge, the smelter was relocated from the San Francisco River to the mines. The first concentrator was built and a \"baby\" gauge railroad connected the DCC mines with the transport system of the neighboring Arizona Copper Company, which connected to the transcontinental Southern Pacific Railroad. Church had made his DCC into one of the early, respectable copper operations in the territory. In 1897, he sold his 55% interests in the DCC to Phelps Dodge for a reported $800,000, retired to his stone mansion in Denver's capitol hill neighborhood, and earned a reputation as philanthropist and real estate baron.James Douglas became president and general manager of the operation for Phelps Dodge, which increased the DCC capital stock from $500,000 to one million dollars, and over the next four years greatly expanded DCC operations with a new rail connection, concentrator, and improved, rebuilt smelter. Metallurgist and Douglas protege, Dr. L.D. Ricketts designed the 600 ton Yankee concentrator, one of the most innovative of the time, and the first of many modern, ever enlarging plants built in the district (steel beams with iron sheeting, Wilfley tables, vanners and jigs for gravity concentration, which could work ores under 3% copper). The Morenci Southern narrow gauge railroad, completed in 1901, connected the mines via five loops over itself in the 18 miles of rails down the mountainside to a junction with the New Mexico & Arizona line. A network of \"baby\" gauge railroad tracks connected the mine works, plants, and the Morenci Southern. Under Dr. Douglas, the smelter was rebuilt with five blast furnaces and Bessemer converters which produced a purer copper for the market. At its peak, Detroit Copper Co. consisted of 145 mining claims at Morenci.Detroit Copper Co. founded the town of Morenci (originally named Joy's camp after Ward's first local manager) to supply housing and services to workers employed by the company. After a devastating fire in 1897, Morenci was relocated three quarters of a mile down the canyon. DCC managers organized the Morenci Improvement Company to help rebuild the town and construct better housing. In time, DCC or the improvement company owned a large store, a hotel, and considerable amounts of additional property in the town of Morenci. DCC also funded a free public library, gymnasium and improved schools for workers and their families. At the beginning of the twentieth century the town of Morenci had distinctive southwestern architecture, with Spanish mission style and rustic stone buildings used by the company around a central camp plaza. (The original \"Hell's Half Acre\" of saloons and brothels were re-built away from the plaza). DCC also established a water pumping plant on the San Francisco River seven miles away. The nearby smelter town of Clifton was settled to provide additional housing, and eventually eclipsed the camp becoming Greenlee county seat.The company employed mostly Mexican miners, who were paid about half what Caucasian miners earned. During the Church era, Mexican miners were paid with company script, or paper \"boletas, which could only be spent at the company store, a base for contention between miners and the company. The boleta system was eased out after the DCC was acquired by Phelps Dodge. As with many mines in Arizona and New Mexico at the time, the Detroit Copper Co. saw several waves of labor union organizing as well as strikes from 1900 onward. DCC used labor spies to infiltrate nascent unions and stop organizing campaigns.A significant problem in early copper camps were disputes over ownership of ore bodies based on the 1872 Mining Law's \"rule of the apex.\" This was defined where the company which owned the apex (or outcrop) of an ore body could mine ore across mine claim boundaries following vein \"dips, spurs, and angles\u201d. Church was able to avoid a potential lawsuit with neighboring claim holders by agreeing to ignore the rule of the apex and use British common law, whereby the companies extracted ore from only within their claim boundaries. In May 1882, Church's company agreed to co-develop the \"Detroit lode\" with the Longfellow Copper Mining Company (later purchased by the Arizona Copper Company). Although federal and state law provided that the company which accessed the lode had the right to develop the entire deposit, Detroit Copper lacked the capital to do so and agreed to permit Longfellow Copper to mine the lode as well, up to their agreed claim boundaries. This shift away from the rule of the apex to common law was followed later in other Arizona copper districts, most notably at Bisbee, Arizona.After the 1917 reorganization of the Phelps Dodge & Co holding company into the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the Detroit Copper Company ceased to exist. The operation was then known as \"Phelps Dodge Corporation, Morenci Branch.\" In 1921, Phelps Dodge acquired the mines of the adjacent Arizona Copper Company, Ltd, creating a world class copper operation, which is now one of the largest copper producers in the United States.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Video games are a key part of the system's software library, and the 1980 first-person space combat simulator Star Raiders is considered the platform's killer app. The \"Atari 8-bit family\" label was not contemporaneous. Atari, Inc., used the term \"Atari 800 [or 400] home computer system\", often combining the model names into \"Atari 400/800\" or \"Atari home computers\".The Atari 800 was packaged as a high-end model, and the 400 was more affordable. The 400 has a pressure-sensitive, spillproof membrane keyboard and initially shipped with 8 KB of RAM. The 800 has a conventional keyboard and a second cartridge slot, and allows easy RAM upgrades to 48K. Both use identical technology: the MOS Technology 6502 CPU at 1.79 MHz (1.77 MHz for PAL versions) and the same custom coprocessor chips. The plug-and-play peripherals use the Atari SIO serial bus, and one of the SIO developers eventually went on to co-patent USB (Universal Serial Bus). The core architecture of the Atari 8-bit family was reused in the 1982 Atari 5200 game console, but games for the two systems are incompatible.\nThe 400 and 800 were replaced by multiple computers with the same technology and different presentation.

The Sea Lion competed against another biplane, a Avro 539. The Sea Lion took the opportunity to be fitted with a newly-arrived propeller, after the Avro was accidentally damaged before the start of the trials. During the competition, the Sea Lion proved to be slower than the Avro, but was nevertheless selected on the basis of its performance; the Avro was held in reserve.On 10 September, the day of the contest, Henri Biard of Supermarine took paying passengers around Swanage Bay in the aircraft.

Prior to the start of the race, the Sea Lion remained at sea. It thus avoided the damage caused to its rivals after they landed on the beach from Cowes. The undamaged planes set off, but the thick fog obscured the route of the race, and mid-flight the Sea Lion's pilot, Squadron leader Basil D.

{"id": "176_527", "question": "Which company is Jeep Patriot produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_57768", "text": "In the U.S. the Patriot uses either the 2.0 L or 2.4 L World gasoline I4 engine. Both front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive are available. The Patriot features two four-wheel drive systems both of which are electronically controlled. \nThe standard four-wheel drive system is called Freedom Drive I. This is a full-time Automatic 4WD that directly drives the front differential carrier from the transmission output and is exclusively front-wheel drive whenever 4WD is not commanded by the powertrain control module or the driver. The transaxle supplies power to the rear drive unit via a driveshaft that is in constant mesh with the front carrier. The driveshaft joins the front transaxle  through a small, fixed ratio gearbox which Jeep refers to as the Power Transfer Unit.The driveshaft is suspended by a centrally mounted carrier bearing and delivers torque to an assembly at the rear of the vehicle Jeep refers to as the Rear Drive Unit. An electronically controlled multi-plate wet clutch located inside the rear drive unit variably couples this driveshaft with a pinion gear that drives an open differential carrier and delivers power to the rear wheels. The clutch coupling force is sufficient to supply up to 100% of available engine torque to the rear axle.  A driver accesible control located between the front seats allows the driver to command a locked 4wd mode that simulates the behavior of a fixed center coupling on a conventional 4WD vehicle.  In both the default operating mode and the driver selected 4WD mode, the operation of this clutch is computer controlled and it will disconnect and revert to automatic operation above 35 miles per hour.  To prevent static driveline windup the powertrain controller will vary the force of clutch engagement while the vehicle is traveling on a curved path, using input from a steering angle sensor.  \nAn optional four-wheel drive system called Freedom Drive II is based on Freedom Drive I and operates similarly, however in combination with a unique CVT transmission it is capable of a 19:1 gear reduction simulating a low range usually found in vehicles with dedicated transfer cases.  This 19:1 \"crawl\" ratio is achieved with a much lower (numerically higher) ring and pinion ratio compared to non Freedom Drive II vehicles and permits the driver to optionally hold this initial ratio for enhanced control at very low speeds.  \nFreedom Drive II is part of an equipment package including several other enhancements intended for use on more difficult terrain and Jeep Patriots with this package bear Jeep's \"Trail Rated\" badging.  \nAll Jeep Patriots include an enhanced traction control system that operates on both driven axles (4WD models) or on the front axle only (2WD models) to supply torque to all four wheels effectively and without a locking or limited slip differential.  This system is branded BLD by Jeep and operates by applying braking force to a wheel on either (driven) axle if that wheel is measured spinning faster than the other wheel on the same axle.  BLD remains in effect even if the driver selects the traction control off option.   \nThe 2.4 L GEMA I4 is an option for the 4X2 model Patriot.\nFor Europe and Australia, a 2.0 L (1968 cc; 120 cid; 140ps) Volkswagen-manufactured diesel engine is fitted along with a 6-speed manual gearbox. All EU cars are fitted as standard with four wheel drive and a version of the Freedom Drive System that tuned differently from the U.S. versions, but with similar capability to FDII with brake traction control and three switchable electronic stability control and traction control settings for on or off-road use.\nThe Patriot won the 2007 Green 4x4 Award and the 2008 4x4 of the Year in the UK.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A few years later, the engine was upgraded with the installation of a six-speed transmission, together with newer instrument panel and handlebar switches, as well as a cross-drilled front disc brake rotor.\nThe design of the RX-Z remained unchanged until 2004 when the model was updated, with the rear lights borrowed from the Yamaha Y125Z. The new RX-Z was equipped with a catalytic converter, sacrificing 1 PS of maximum power (original maximum power: 21 PS). However, the maximum torque remained unchanged but the low-end torque was improved compared with the early models. Some owners of the earlier RX-Z motorcycles may have problems during take-off because the engine tends to stall when an inexperienced rider tries to take off in the first gear. However, the problem was resolved in the new model.\nIn Malaysia, the RX-Z was one of the motorcycle models often associated with Mat Rempit street racers.

HMS Formidable's 826 and 829 Squadrons were the first to operate the Albacore from an aircraft carrier, operations commencing in November 1940. The Albacore suffered from reliability problems with the Taurus engine, although these were later solved, so that the failure rate was no worse than the Pegasus equipped Swordfish. The Albacore remained less popular than the Swordfish, as it was less manoeuvrable, while the controls were considered to be too heavy for a pilot to perform much evasive action after dropping a torpedo.Eventually, there were 15 first-line FAA squadrons equipped with the Albacore which operated widely in the Mediterranean. In March 1941, Albacores made torpedo attacks during the Battle of Cape Matapan, inflicting severe damage on the Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto despite the presence of heavy anti-aircraft fire. The type also played a prominent role in the ill-fated raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo during July 1941. Albacores also participated, with greater success, in the fighting at El Alamein, dropping flares to mark targets for RAF night bombers.Between September 1941 and June 1943, No. 828 Squadron, based at RAF Hal Far, Malta, operated a squadron of Albacores under severe blitz conditions during the Siege of Malta. The type employed a mixture of mines and bombs to attack Italian shipping, including convoys, along with shore targets in Sicily, mainland Italy, and North Africa. Albacores also supported the landings at Sicily and Salerno, guarding against enemy submarines and raiding key enemy facilities such as airfields and forts.\nOn 9 March 1942, twelve Albacores from HMS Victorious attacked the German battleship Tirpitz at sea near Narvik. Based on information from one of a search force of six Albacores that had been launched earlier, Albacores from 817 and 832 Squadrons launched torpedoes. One attack came within 20 yd (18 m) of Tirpitz, but the attack failed for the loss of two aircraft.During 1943, the Albacore was replaced in FAA service by the newer Barracuda. The final Albacore squadron of the FAA, No. 841 Squadron, which had flown numerous shore-based attacks against shipping in the English Channel for the whole of its career with the Albacore, was disbanded in late 1943.The Royal Air Force deployed some Albacores; 36 Squadron based at Singapore acquired five to supplement its Vickers Vildebeests at RAF Seletar in December 1941. The remnants of the squadron was captured by the Japanese in March 1942. During 1943, No. 415 Squadron RCAF was equipped with Albacores (presumably ex-FAA) before the Flight operating them was transferred and reformed as 119 Squadron at RAF Manston in July 1944. The squadron deployed later to Belgium and their Albacores were disposed of in early 1945, due to spares shortages, in favour of the inferior but ASV radar-equipped Swordfish Mk.IIIs that the squadron kept until the end of the war on 8 May. This was to combat German mini-submarines attacking Allied shipping entering the River Scheldt on its way to the Port of Antwerp. The Aden Communication Flight used 17 Albacores between the middle of 1944 and August 1946. Some of these were delivered by sea on the SS Empire Arun in December 1945 (all from Royal Navy stock).\nThe Royal Canadian Air Force took over the Albacores and used them during the Normandy invasion, for a similar role until July 1944.

The commercial failure of the Virtual Boy was reportedly a contributing factor to Yokoi's withdrawal from Nintendo, although he had already planned to retire years prior and then finished the successful Game Boy Pocket, which was released shortly before his departure. According to his Nintendo and Koto colleague Yoshihiro Taki, Yokoi had originally decided to retire at age 50 to do as he pleased but had simply delayed it. Nintendo held that Yokoi's departure was \"absolutely coincidental\" to the market performance of any Nintendo hardware. The New York Times maintained that Yokoi kept a close relationship with Nintendo. After leaving Nintendo, Yokoi founded his own company, Koto, and collaborated with Bandai to create the WonderSwan, a handheld system competing with the Game Boy.\nThe commercial failure of the Virtual Boy reportedly did little to alter Nintendo's development approach and focus on innovation. The console's focus on peripherals and haptic technology reemerged in later years. The original inventor, Reflection Technology, Inc., was reportedly financially \"devastated\" by the Virtual Boy's performance, with dwindling operations by 1997.The Nintendo 3DS console was launched in 2011, as a handheld gaming console with autostereoscopic 3D visuals, without any special glasses. Prior to launch, Shigeru Miyamoto discussed the Virtual Boy. He said it renders wireframe graphics, but its effects are generally used for two-dimensional games with depth-separated planes. He stated that the graphics are not as appealing, and while developing the Nintendo 64, he had ruled out the use of wireframe graphics as too sparse to draw player characters. Finally, he stated that he perceived the Virtual Boy as a novelty that should not have used the Nintendo license so prominently.In February 2016, Tatsumi Kimishima stated that Nintendo was \"looking into\" virtual reality but also explained that it would take more time and effort for them to assess the technology, and in a February 2017 interview with Nikkei, he stated that the company was \"studying\" VR, and would add it to the Nintendo Switch once it is figured out how users can play for long durations without any issues. Nintendo introduced a VR accessory for the Switch as part of Labo, a line of player-assembled cardboard toys leveraging the console's hardware and Joy-Con controllers. In this case, the console is used as a head-mounted display for the headset.\nHobbyists adapted Virtual Boy to other displays. Emulation enabled modern stereoscopic goggles such as Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR and Oculus Rift in 2016. In 2018, hobbyist Furrtek released a board that replaces the display circuitry, allowing the Virtual Boy to be played on a VGA monitor or television set. On February 25, 2024, a homebrew Virtual Boy emulator for the Nintendo 3DS was released, named \"Red Viper\", which made it possible to play the Virtual Boy library using stereoscopic 3D.Nintendo has referenced the Virtual Boy in other games, such as Tomodachi Life\u2014where a trailer for the life simulation game included a scene of several Mii characters worshipping the Virtual Boy. In Luigi's Mansion 3, Luigi uses a device by Professor E. Gadd known as the \"Virtual Boo\" to access maps and other information in-game (succeeding the use of devices referencing the Game Boy Color and first-generation Nintendo DS in previous installments). Its menus use a red and black color scheme, while E. Gadd optimistically boasts that the device would \"fly off the shelves\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was released in 1968 by Daisy Outdoor Products.\nIn 1961, Cass Hough, the president of Daisy Heddon division of Victor Comptometer, purchased the design of a new firearm system.  The new system was developed by a Belgian chemist named Jules Van Langenhover.  The new gun would be known as the Daisy V/L rifle.The V/L ammunition consisted of a .22 caliber bullet with a small cylinder of propellant on the back, and no primer. The rifle resembled a typical spring-air rifle, but the 2000\u00b0 hot, high-pressure air served not only to propel the projectile but also to ignite the propellant on the back of the V/L cartridge. The rifle uses a small, unique, and well designed part called an Obturator (obturator/ignitor) to compress the air as it is pushed through a tiny hole. This air is heated as it is pushed through the small hole enough to ignite the powder of the caseless round.The V/L guns and ammunition were discontinued in 1969 after the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled that they constituted a firearm, and Daisy, which was not licensed to manufacture firearms, decided to discontinue manufacture rather than become a firearms manufacturer. About 23,000 of the rifles were made before production ceased.\nThe V/L has been added to the ATF Curio & Relic list.", "hasanswer": true}]}

More people died manufacturing the V-2 than were killed by its deployment.\n\nThe V-2 consumed a third of Germany's fuel alcohol production and major portions of other critical technologies: to distil the fuel alcohol for one V-2 launch required 30 tonnes of potatoes at a time when food was becoming scarce. Due to a lack of explosives, some warheads were simply filled with concrete, using the kinetic energy alone for destruction, and sometimes the warhead contained photographic propaganda of German citizens who had died in Allied bombings.The psychological effect of the V-2 was considerable, as the V-2, traveling faster than the speed of sound, gave no warning before impact (unlike bombing planes or the V-1 flying bomb, which made a characteristic buzzing sound). There was no effective defence and no risk of pilot or crew casualties. An example of the impression it made is in the reaction of American pilot and future nuclear strategist and Congressional aide William Liscum Borden, who in November 1944 while returning from a nighttime air mission over Holland saw a V-2 in flight on its way to strike London:  \"It resembled a meteor, streaming red sparks and whizzing past us as though the aircraft were motionless. I became convinced that it was only a matter of time until rockets would expose the United States to direct, transoceanic attack.\"With the war all but lost, regardless of the factory output of conventional weapons, the Nazis resorted to V-weapons as a tenuous last hope to influence the war militarily (hence Antwerp as V-2 target), as an extension of their desire to \"punish\" their foes and most importantly to give hope to their sympathizers with their miracle weapon.

In 2009, the NOAA oceanographic research ship NOAAS McArthur II (R 330) began operating a ScanEagle owned by the University of Alaska to monitor the distribution and population of seals in the Bering Sea.In April 2009, a ScanEagle launched by the U.S. Navy was used during the stand-off between the U.S. Navy and a lifeboat controlled by pirates holding Captain Richard Phillips of the MV Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean after a failed hijack attempt.Insitu announced that the ScanEagle had totaled 500,000 combat flight hours and over 56,000 sorties by July 2011.In September 2011, Insitu revealed the ScanEagle had been employed by the U.S. Navy in Operation Unified Protector during the 2011 Libyan Revolution. The UAV was launched and recovered by the destroyer USS Mahan (DDG-72) to provide video imagery over three days that located \"contacts of interest that no one else could find,\" which was relayed to the ship and then to the NATO command center by the secure video injection system.\nIn late May 2013, the U.S. Coast Guard used a ScanEagle to seize over 1,000 lb (450 kg) of cocaine from a fast boat in the eastern Pacific. The ScanEagle was being deployed off the USCGC Bertholf (WMSL-750) during demonstrations to assess UAV use in the Coast Guard. The aircraft was able to maintain visual surveillance of the boat until a cutter was able to interdict the vessel, marking the first time a UAV deployed from a Coast Guard cutter participated in drug interdiction. The trials in May lasted two weeks with 90 flight hours completed. The Coast Guard hopes to begin purchases of unmanned aerial systems by FY 2016, with small UAVs deployed from its National Security Cutter fleet by the following year. Long-term goals are to use unmanned systems to augment their manned fleet, while UAVs on offshore patrol cutters would replace medium endurance cutters.On 26 July 2013, the ScanEagle became one of the first unmanned aerial vehicles to be granted certification by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly in U.S. airspace for commercial purposes. ScanEagles will be deployed to Alaska off a ship for ConocoPhillips to scout for icebergs and count whales, protecting drilling platforms and fulfilling environmental requirements. The ScanEagle can safely accomplish observation missions in hazardous Arctic locations, which is safer, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly than using manned aircraft. Commercial certification was the result of previous military certification and the Congressionally mandated opening of airspace over much of Alaska to small UAVs. Only four ScanEagles were certified with strict requirements: only one aircraft of the type is allowed airborne at any one time, they cannot fly through clouds or icing conditions, and they cannot take off or land during certain gust and wind conditions. The certifications did not mention line-of-sight control. On 12 September 2013, a ScanEagle with ConocoPhillips conducted its first flight from a research vessel and flew for 36 minutes. On its second flight, the aircraft experienced engine failure. It aborted the flight and landed in the water, as it was programmed to. A boat recovered the downed ScanEagle.In July 2016, IHS Janes reported that Royal Navy frigates will cease operating the ScanEagle by November 2017.

It was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937. Toyota is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing about 10 million vehicles per year.\nThe company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.\nAfter World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.\nIn the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of the rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to a growing middle-class, leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile. The booming economy also funded an international expansion that allowed Toyota to grow into one of the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in Japan and the ninth-largest company in the world by revenue, as of December 2020. Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle. By September 2023, total production reached 300 million vehicles.Toyota was praised for being a leader in the development and sales of more fuel-efficient hybrid electric vehicles, starting with the introduction of the XW10 Toyota Prius in 1997. The company now sells more than 40 hybrid vehicle models around the world. More recently, the company has also been criticized for being slow to adopt all-electric vehicles and focusing on the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, like the Toyota Mirai, a technology that is costlier and has fallen far behind electric batteries.\nAs of 2022, the Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under four brands: Daihatsu, Hino, Lexus and the namesake Toyota.

The January 1905 design developed by the MTK and other designs submitted by the public as part of a design competition were all rejected by the Navy as impracticable. They instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and Electric Boat for a competitive evaluation. The two Electric Boat submarines comprised the U-5 class. The Navy authorized two boats, U-5 and U-6, from Whitehead & Co. of Fiume in 1906.The U-5 class was built to the same design as the C class for the US Navy and was built by Robert Whitehead's firm of Whitehead & Co. under license from Electric Boat. Components for the first two Austrian boats were manufactured by the Electric Boat Company and assembled at Fiume, while the third boat was a speculative private venture by Whitehead that failed to find a buyer and was purchased by Austria-Hungary upon the outbreak of World War I.The U-5-class boats had a single-hulled design with a teardrop-shape that bore a strong resemblance to modern nuclear submarines. The boats were just over 105 feet (32 m) long and displaced 240 tonnes (240 long tons) surfaced, and 273 tonnes (269 long tons) submerged. The torpedo tubes featured unique, cloverleaf-shaped design hatches that rotated on a central axis. The ships were powered by twin 6-cylinder gasoline engines while surfaced, but suffered from inadequate ventilation which resulted in frequent intoxication of the crew. While submerged, they were propelled by twin electric motors.The first two boats, U-5 and U-6, were ordered by the Austro-Hungarian Navy for evaluation and were partially assembled in the United States, shipped to Fiume, and riveted together by Whitehead & Co., which, author Edwin Sieche reports, \"caused a lot of trouble\". U-5 was launched in February 1909 and was followed in June by the launch of U-6. Both boats were commissioned by April 1910.The third boat, originally named SS-3, was built on speculation entirely at Whitehead's in Fiume. The boat's design featured improvements in the electrical and mechanical systems. Gibson and Prendergast report that, when built, SS-3 was powered by electric motors for both surface and submerged running. When the surface performance of the electric motors proved disappointing in trials, SS-3's power-plant was rebuilt to match the gasoline/electric combination used in U-5 and U-6. SS-3 was launched in March 1911 and was offered to the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but because the evaluation of the first two U-5-class boats was still underway, they declined to purchase.As built, the U-5-class boats were armed with two 45-centimeter (17.7 in) bow torpedo tubes and could carry a supply of four torpedoes. By 1915, all had received a 3.7 cm/23 (1.5 in) deck gun.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "176_607", "question": "Which company is Porsche 959 produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_58074", "text": "Development of the 959 (originally called the Gruppe B) started in 1981, shortly after the company's then-new Managing Director, Peter Schutz, took his office. Porsche's chief engineer at the time, Helmuth Bott, approached Schutz with some ideas about the Porsche 911, or more aptly, a new one. Bott knew that the company needed a sports car that they could continue to rely on for years to come and that could be developed as time went on. Curious as to how much they could do with the rear-engined 911, Bott convinced Schutz that development tests should take place, and even proposed researching a new all wheel drive system. Schutz agreed, and gave the project the green light. Bott also knew through experience that a racing program usually helped to accelerate the development of new models. Seeing Group B rallying as the perfect arena to test the new development mule and its all wheel drive system, Bott again went to Schutz and got the approval to develop a car, based on his development mule, for competition in Group B.\n\nThe powerplant is a sequential twin-turbocharged DOHC flat-six engine equipped with 4 valves per cylinder, fuel fed by Bosch Motronic 2.1 fuel injection with air-cooled cylinders and water-cooled heads, with a bore x stroke of 95 mm \u00d7 67 mm (3.74 in \u00d7 2.64 in) for a total displacement of 2,849 cc (173.9 cu in). It was coupled to a unique manual transmission offering six forward speeds with the first gear labelled \"gel\u00e4nde\" (terrain), allowing the car to pass noise regulations, as well as reverse. The engine was largely based on the 4-camshaft 24-valve powerplant used in the Porsche 956 and 962 race cars. These components allowed Porsche to extract 450 PS (331 kW; 444 hp) at 6,500 rpm and 500 N\u22c5m (369 lb\u22c5ft) of torque at 5,000 rpm from the compact and efficient power unit. The use of sequential twin turbochargers rather than the more usual identical turbochargers for each of the two cylinder banks allowed for smooth delivery of power across the engine speed band, in contrast to the abrupt on-off power characteristic that distinguished Porsche's other turbocharged engines of the period. The engine was used virtually unchanged in the 959 road car as well.\nTo create a rugged, lightweight shell, Porsche adopted an aluminium and Aramid (Kevlar) composite for the body panels and chassis construction along with a Nomex floor, instead of the steel floor normally used on their production cars.\nPorsche also developed the car's aerodynamics, which were designed to increase stability, as was the automatic ride-height adjustment that became available on the road car (961 race cars had a fixed suspension system). Its drag coefficient was as low as 0.31 and aerodynamic lift was eliminated.The 959 also featured Porsche-Steuer Kupplung (PSK) all-wheel-drive system. Capable of dynamically changing the torque distribution between the rear and front wheels in both normal and slip conditions, the PSK system gave the 959 the adaptability it needed both as a race car and as a \"super\" street car. Under hard acceleration, PSK could send as much as 80% of the available power to the rear wheels, helping make the most of the rear-traction bias that occurs at such times. It could also vary the power bias depending on road surface and grip changes, helping maintain traction at all times. The dashboard featured gauges displaying the amount of rear differential slip as well as transmitted power to the front axle. The magnesium alloy wheels were unique, being hollow inside to form a sealed chamber contiguous with the tyre and equipped with a built-in tyre pressure monitoring system.The 959 was actually produced at Karosserie Baur, not at the Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen, on an assembly line with Porsche inspectors overseeing the finished bodies. Most of Porsche's special order interior leather work was also done by the workers at Baur.\nThe 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show was chosen for the unveiling of the Porsche Group B prototype. Even in the closing hours of October 9, finishing touches were being applied to the car to go on display the next morning. After the first two prototypes, the bodywork was modified to include air vents in the front and rear wheel housings, as well as intake holes behind the doors. The first prototype receiving those modifications was code named \"F3\", and was destroyed in the first crash test.The road version of the 959 debuted at the 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show as a 1986 model, but numerous issues delayed production by more than a year. The car was manufactured in two levels of trim, \"Komfort\" and \"Sport\", corresponding to the trim with more creature comforts and a more track focused trim. First customer deliveries of the 959 street variant began in 1987, and the car debuted at a cost of DM431,550 (US$225,000) each, still less than half what it cost Porsche to build each car. Production ended in 1988 with 292 cars completed. In total, 337 cars were built, including 37 prototypes and pre-production models. At least one 959 and one 961 remain in the Porsche historic hall in Stuttgart, Germany.\nIn 1992/1993, Porsche built eight more cars assembled from spare parts from the inventory at the manufacturing site in Zuffenhausen. All eight were \"Komfort\" versions: four in red and four in silver. These cars were much more expensive (DM 747,500) than the earlier ones. The later cars also featured a newly developed speed-sensitive damper system. The cars were sold to selected collectors after being driven by works personnel for some time and are today by far the most sought-after 959 models.\nIf desired, even more power was available to customer cars by Porsche. According to Paul Fr\u00e8re there was an optional 530 PS (390 kW; 523 hp) factory upgrade, with an increased top speed of 336 km/h (209 mph) along with the 0\u2013100 km/h (0\u201360 mph) acceleration time reduced to 3.4 seconds.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was the manufacturer's first car with a four-cylinder engine.   653 were produced.\nThe V4C3 was propelled using a four-cylinder 1,725 cm\u00b3 four-stroke engine, mounted ahead of the driver.   This was the first, and till now (2012) the only Peugeot to feature a V4 engine.   A maximum 9 hp of power was delivered to the rear wheels.\nThe car was the first of several Lion-Peugeot models that became known as a Lion-Peugeot 10 hp.   This was a reference to the car's fiscal horse power, applying a system of car classification for taxation purposes then being established in France.   Tax horsepower then, and for several decades to come, was defined purely as a function of the combined surface area of the engine's cylinders, this being far easier to assess consistently and accurately than the actual power produced by an engine.   At this stage fiscal horse-power tended to equate approximately to actual horse-power, although the two would diverge subsequently, as engines became more efficient at extracting power from a given sum of cylinder diameters.  Eventually, in the second half of the twentieth century, more complex (and less internationally consistent) definitions of fiscal horse power would replace those defined only by cylinder diameters.\nThe V4C3 shared its 2,250 mm wheel base with the manufacturer's models from the previous year such as their twin-cylinder Type V2C3.   The 3,200 mm (approximately) body length provided space for between two and four people depending on the body specified.   The wide range of different body types offered followed a pattern that by now would have been familiar to many Lion-Peugeot buyers.

It was the second turbojet-powered combat aircraft to be developed in Sweden, the first being the Saab 21R, and it was the first Western European fighter to be produced with a swept wing after the Second World War, only being preceded in Western Europe as a whole by the Messerschmitt Me 262 built during the conflict.Work on what would become the Tunnan commenced in late 1945. The design, internally designated R 1001, had a barrel-like fuselage, giving it a destinctive rotund appearance, from which its name is derived. A relatively thin swept wing configuration was adopted after wartime aerodynamic research from Germany indicated its favourable high speed qualities. It was powered by the recently-developed de Havilland Ghost turbojet engine. The Swedish Air Force placed an initial order for three prototypes under the service designation J 29 during Autumn 1946. On 1 September 1948, the first prototype performed its maiden flight; flight testing proved the aircraft to exceed performance estimates in several aspects.\nDuring May 1951, Br\u00e5valla Wing (F 13) received the first production aircraft. Five principal variants of the Tunnan were produced; the first model to enter service being the J 29A fighter, the more capable J 29B and J 29E fighters, and finally the afterburner-equipped J 29F fighter, which was the final fighter variant to be built.

Originally released in its home market of Japan in late 1997 as the Toyota Harrier, export sales began in March 1998 as the Lexus RX.Considered as the first luxury crossover SUV, five generations of the RX have been produced to date, the first being compact in size, and the latter classified as mid-size. Both front- and four-wheel drive configurations have been used on the RX series, and several gasoline powertrain options, including V6 engines and hybrid systems, have been offered. In the Lexus model lineup, the RX sits below the larger Lexus LX (marketed as the Toyota Land Cruiser body-on-frame SUVs outside North America, respectively), and above the shorter and less wider, but taller GX SUV. The name \"RX\" stands for \"Radiant Crossover\". It has also been labelled as \"Recreational Cross Country\" in some markets.

However, several officials felt that the single-cabbed arrangement used by the majority of Type 1s presented drivers with visibility difficulties in the 'less convenient' direction. BR therefore approached several manufacturers to seek a new locomotive that had a centre cab and low bonnets to maximise visibility. Clayton were selected to produce their proposed locomotive as the Class 17. Its low engine covers required the use of a pair of Paxman 6ZHXL six-cylinder horizontal engines, which had been intended for powering railcars; it was a somewhat unorthodox arrangement for the era.\nProduction of the Class 17 was undertaken between 1962 and 1965, with the locomotives being assigned to the north of Britain and the Scottish Region. Early on it was determined that the locomotive was not suited to heavy freight trains, and they quickly acquired a reputation for unreliability largely due to the engines, which continued to deliver poor performance even after extensive modifications. The Class 17 proved to be one of the least successful of the Type 1s, such that by 1967, long lines of unserviceable locomotives could be found stored in less accessible sidings at various locations across the Central Belt of Scotland (e.g. Ardrossan and Millerhill). Withdrawals took place from July 1968 to December 1971, meaning some members of the class had a working life of less than 5 years.

The R\u00e9seau trainsets are based on the earlier TGV Atlantique. The first R\u00e9seau (English: Network) sets entered service in 1993.\nFifty dual-voltage trainsets were built in 1992\u20131994, numbered 501-550. A further 40 triple-voltage trainsets, numbered 4501-4540, were built in 1994\u20131996. The last ten of these triple voltage units are known as Thalys PBA (Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam) sets, originally built for Thalys and now operated by Eurostar after the companies merged. As well as using standard French voltages of 25 kV 50 Hz AC and 1,500 V DC (also used in the Netherlands), the triple voltage sets can operate under the Belgian and Italian 3,000 V DC supplies.\nThey are formed of two power cars (8,800 kW (11,801 hp) under 25 kV\u2014like the TGV Atlantique) and eight carriages, giving a capacity of 377 seats.

The dual-voltage sets weigh 383 tonnes (844,370 lb), and owing to axle-load restrictions in Belgium the triple-voltage sets have a series of modifications, such as the replacement of steel with aluminium and hollow axles, to reduce the weight to under 17 t (16.7 long tons; 18.7 short tons) per axle. Owing to early complaints of uncomfortable pressure changes when entering tunnels at high speed on the LGV Atlantique, the R\u00e9seau sets are pressure-sealed.\nIn 2006 the carriages of nineteen sets were used to form TGV POS sets by using new TGV POS power cars for services on the LGV Est to Germany and Switzerland. The 38 R\u00e9seau power cars were slightly modified and joined to new Duplex carriages, forming nineteen TGV R\u00e9seau Duplex units.

Lost out in trials to the tracked-only A-32. The only built prototype is known to have participated in the Battle of Moscow. In 1941, as the Germans neared Moscow, the situation was so desperate that everything battle-worthy was put into service by the Soviets. The A-20 prototype, which at that time was at Kubinka army proving ground near Moscow for evaluation trials, was immediately put into service together with other prototypes of tanks present here, which were organized into a separate company led by Captain Semenov. Later on, the tank was included in the 22nd Tank Brigade organic, together with its predecessors and successors, BT-7 and T-34 tanks. On 1 December 1941, during fighting, the tank was seriously damaged and sent to the rear for repairs. Three days later, it re-entered service with the 22nd Tank Brigade until mid-December, when the tank was again damaged and evacuated to the rear. After these events, its fate is unknown.\n A-32 (A-20G): initially known as the A-20G (G - tracked) and then renamed to A-32, it was the competitor to the A-20. The wheels-and-tracks system was removed for the first time from the BT tanks series, making the tank design and production easier, more reliable and, especially, lighter; in fact, armor was increased to 30 mm, hull was enlarged, 5th road wheel was fitted in for better ground-pressure distribution and the 45 mm 20-K gun was replaced by the 76.2 mm L-10 gun, but the weight increased by only 1 ton (from 18 to 19 tons, respectively for the A-20 and A-32). Trials in 1939 showed that the tank armor could be upgraded and thus a request for increase to 45 mm was made. A second prototype was specially created for the purpose, this time equipped with turret and 45 mm armament from the A-20 and with additional weights placed on special brackets welded on the hull and turret to simulate mass of the up-armored tank. After satisfactory tests, other requests were made, for example to improve the visibility from inside the tank and to adopt the newer F-32 gun (later the L-11 and F-34 were adopted on prototypes and production models instead), which finally lead to the A-34, serial produced as the famous T-34.Foreign variants:\n\nBT-42: Finnish assault gun; captured BT-7s were equipped with British QF 4.5-inch howitzers.

The Asylum's business model revolves around producing as many low-budget films as quickly as possible, and earn around $150,000 to $250,000 in profit. Since the company produces dozens of films every year, this model generates millions of dollars, and the company claims to have never lost money on a film. The Asylum spends around 4-6 months making a film, and since the company is not affiliated with any industry guilds other than SAG-AFTRA, this means their employees will sometimes work upwards of 22 hours a day.\nInitially founded as a distribution company for low-budget drama films, The Asylum switched to in-house productions in the mid-2000s due to competition from larger studios like Lionsgate Films. In 2005, The Asylum released the film H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds the day before Steven Spielberg film War of the Worlds. Blockbuster ordered 100,000 copies, which inspired The Asylum to focus on mockbusters. This led to a partnership with the television channel Syfy, and with the rise of video on demand (VOD) services in the early 2010s, partnerships with Pluto TV and Tubi. The Asylum's greatest success came in 2013 with the film Sharknado, which is about a waterspout that lifts sharks out of the ocean and drops them over Los Angeles. The over-the-top premise went viral, and led to the creation of the Sharknado franchise.

Their Triumph-badged 'in-house' competitor failed to achieve anything like the sales figures of the BMC small FWD cars, though the BMC 1100 range featured several badge-engineered variants.  Moreover, the front wheel drive configuration failed to realise the handling and road-holding advantages that Triumph had hoped for, and the tall profile limited other uses for the FWD drive train, such as in the Spitfire. The 1300 was well-made and sold reasonably well in the small luxury sector, but after its direct successor was quietly switched to rear wheel drive in 1973, Triumph never designed another FWD car. More significantly, from 1970 the 1300 was re-engineered as a rear-wheel drive car and went on to form the core of Triumph's compact range as the 1300 cc Triumph Toledo (launched in 1971) and the larger engined Triumph Dolomite released in 1972.  Like all Standard-Triumph offerings, DIY servicing was simple: the oil filter could be replaced without jacking the car, the clutch plate could be replaced from inside the car.  This simplicity is what made this vehicle stand out from other British made front wheel drive cars. The N/S engine configuration allowed a lot of working space around the engine. The starter was repositioned to the front of the engine and although was a two-minute job to replace, it made the car extremely noisy during startup.  It takes its place in history as being the only production car made in Britain to begin life as a front-wheel drive, and end it as a rear-wheel drive until Leyland's successor, MG Rover, repeated the trick in turning the Rover 75 into the MG ZT 260. The Achilles heel of the 1300 was, primarily the poorly designed suspension wishbone layout and the front stabilizers. Unfortunately, some jobs are very involved. Changing the brake discs, CV joints or front wheel bearings all involve substantial work and should be renewed together if required. engine was too heavy for this particular design and owners found it very frustrating as the rubber bushes had to be changed every few months.  Triumph's alternative engineering design answer to the E/W Mini configuration, was a catastrophic failure. The 1300 was also assembled in Israel by the local partner of Standard-Triumph International, Autocars Co. of Tirat Carmel. However, due to the Israeli government's policy regarding car assembly, Triumph was forced to introduce this vehicle in a 1493 cc version in early 1968, two years ahead of this engine's introduction in the UK. In fact, it was not until another Israeli assembler, Illin Industries, had shut down operations before Triumph could assemble the 1300 in Israel. One curious design offshoot of the 1300 was the \"Pony\" jeep-like farm vehicle, later renamed \"Dragoon\". The Pony was exclusively offered for Autocars within the joint venture contract, but very few units were actually produced in Israel, as of 1968. The same 4WD-design was used in a rally version of the Triumph 1300. The rally project enjoyed some success before the vehicle crashed and rolled in 1969. The 4WD Triumph 1300 was subsequently abandoned.\nAlthough the FWD 1300 was something of a disappointment, the basic design went on to provide Triumph with a popular small car until the end of Dolomite production in 1980 and overall, delivered an outstanding return on their original investment.\nThe Triumph 1300 has a following today in the UK classic car movement, though some parts are now scarce and the number of surviving cars not especially high.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Some days later it was displayed at the Brussels Motor Show.The 1750 Berlina was based on the existing Giulia saloon, which continued in production. The 1750 was meant to top the saloon range, above the 1300 and 1600 cc versions of the Giulia. In the United States, however, the Giulia saloon ceased to be available and was entirely replaced by the 1750 Berlina. The 1750 entered full production in South Africa in early 1969, later complemented by the 2000.In contrast to the Giulia, the 1750s had reworked bodywork and bigger engine, shared many parts with other concurrent models in the Alfa Romeo range, but sold many fewer units during their production span.\nThe 1750 bodyshell had a longer wheelbase than the Giulia, and revised external panels, but it shared many of the same internal panels. The windscreen was also the same. The revisions were carried out by Bertone, and while it resembled the Giulia some of that vehicle's distinctive creases were smoothed out, and there were significant changes to the trim details. The car's taillights were later used on the De Tomaso Longchamp.The car has a 1779 cc twin-carb engine and hydraulic clutch. The 1.8 L engine produced 118 PS (87 kW; 116 hp) with two twin sidedraught carburettors. For the US market the 1750 was equipped with SPICA fuel injection. In November 1969 the 1750 received some minor changes, including side blinker lights at front, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, and top-hinged pedals. This model is referred to as the second series.\nIn 1971, the 1750 Berlina was fitted with an experimental three-speed ZF automatic gearbox. The model designation was 1750A Berlina. According to official Alfa Romeo archives, 252 units were produced with very few surviving to this day. Some of 1750A Berlina didn't have the model plate with production date embossed. The automatic gearbox wasn't well-suited to the four-cylinder motor due to baulky shifting and ill-chosen gear ratio. Because of this, its fuel consumption was frighteningly high and acceleration was a bit  too slow.\nDuring 1971 the 1750 series was superseded across the Alfa Romeo range by the 2000 series; at the top of the saloon line, the 1750 Berlina gave way to the 2000 Berlina. Some 83 final 1750 Berlinas were assembled in 1972. A direct replacement in the 1.8-litre saloon class came that same year, in the form of the all-new Alfa Romeo Alfetta.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Her keel was laid down in 1887 and she was launched on 23 August 1888. After completing fitting-out work, the new cruiser was completed on 8 September 1889 and delivered to the Regia Marina. In 1890, Piemonte participated in the annual fleet maneuvers in the First Squadron, along with the ironclad Lepanto, Dogali, and several torpedo boats. The exercises were conducted in the Tyrrhenian Sea, where the First Squadron was tasked with defending against an attacking \"hostile\" squadron. By 1891, the Italian Navy had determined that Piemonte's armament was too heavy, and so the four broadside 6-inch guns were replaced with lighter 4.7-inch guns and their sponsons removed. In addition, the heavy military masts were replaced by light pole masts. In the following years, the ship served in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean in addition to the Mediterranean. In mid-1896, violence against Italians in Brazil prompted the Italian government to dispatch Piemonte on a mission to secure the interests of Italian nationals in the country. The attempt at gunboat diplomacy secured an official apology from the Brazilian government, as well as an arrangement to adjudicate Italian claims of damages by the United States' and German ambassadors.In late 1901, Piemonte was assigned to the East Asian station after a year-long modernization. She passed through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea and stopped to coal in British Aden while en route to Asian waters. In September 1902 she was in Nagasaki, Japan, with the Italian cruiser Lombardia. Piemonte met the British cruiser HMS Talbot in the British colony at Weihaiwei. A party of officers and men from Piemonte visited the British ship on 28 July. That year, she was joined by the armored cruiser Vettor Pisani and the protected cruiser Elba. The following year, the armored cruiser Marco Polo and the protected cruiser Puglia were scheduled to replace Vettor Pisani and Piemonte, respectively, but due to the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War on 8 February 1904, Piemonte remained in the region. On 24 February, Piemonte arrived in Seoul and landed a contingent of infantry to augment the guards at the Italian embassy. Piemonte was finally recalled to Italy in April; she stopped in Singapore on 22 April to coal, departing two days later for home.By 1908, Piemonte had been assigned as the flagship of the torpedo flotilla of the main fleet, which consisted of seventeen destroyers and fifty first and second class torpedo boats. In August that year, Piemonte participated in the annual summer maneuvers of the Italian fleet. She was assigned to a squadron and was tasked with defending against an opponent fleet that attempted to force an amphibious landing. The maneuvers were modeled on a potential war with Italy's nominal ally Austria-Hungary, and the fact that the relative strengths of the two squadrons mirrored the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies was not lost on analysts in Vienna. The maneuvers concluded with a fleet review on 18 October. Piemonte then spent 1909 deployed again to the Far East.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The EMD (Electro Motive Division of General Motors) DD35 was a cabless booster (B unit) locomotive that consisted of two GP35 locomotives prime movers (engines) and electrical systems, mounted on a common frame and covered with a single cowling, riding on a pair of 4-axle Flexicoil trucks, so each prime mover was powering a single set of 4 axles instead of two sets of 2 axles, as in the GP35. Being a \"B-unit\", the DD35 lacked any sort of cab, and could only be run on the main line when connected with another \"A-unit\" to control it; the DDA35 is an \"A-unit\" version of this locomotive built in 1965. The 4-axle truck was considered too harsh on the trackwork to be in the lead, and thus EMD's response to UP's request was a 4-unit (instead of the requested 3-unit set) locomotive set, consisting of a pair of 2,500 hp GP35s sandwiching a pair of DD35s, to make one 15,000 hp locomotive set (basically six GP35s in four units)\nEMD produced a demonstrator set like this in September 1963, painted in red and white (similar to the Frisco's livery). It was demonstrated on several railroads, but the only interest came from Union Pacific and Southern Pacific. UP bought the entire 4-unit demonstrator set, and followed with an order for 25 more, which were delivered from May through September 1964. The two demonstrator locomotives were numbered 72B and 73B; the 25 production locomotives were assigned 74B through 98B.\nSouthern Pacific ordered a small, three-unit sample, which were shipped with old-style bearings from six F3B trade-in units, but ordered no more. They were numbered 8400-8402, later 9500-9502, and still later 9900-9902. They were used on the SP's Sunset Route early in their lives, but were among the first locomotives sidelined whenever there was a downturn in traffic. Later, they were relegated to transfer service between West Colton and yards closer to Los Angeles, mainly Taylor Yard north of downtown. SP scrapped all three units in 1978 after their leases ran out.\nThe DD35s were initially quite unreliable; some of this was blamed on sand from the internal sandboxes getting in electrical gear, so new sandboxes were fitted on the walkways in 1969. They were among the last EMD road units to be built with DC generators and old-fashioned switchgear, which were more maintenance-intensive than the later AC/DC equipment.\nOnce teething troubles had been surmounted, the DD35s were reasonably successful, but they were less flexible than smaller units and thus all of the original B units were withdrawn by 1977 as the railroads fell on harder times. The DDA35s survived until 1981. All were eventually scrapped.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The 1,600 hp (1,200 kW) FA-2/FB-2 (along with the FPA-2/FPB-2 variants) was built between October 1950 and June 1956. Finally, the 1,800 hp (1,300 kW) FPA-4/FPB-4, powered by the 251 V-12 engine, was built between October 1958 and May 1959 by ALCO's Canadian subsidiary, Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW).The FAs, as well as their cousins, the ALCO PAs, were born as a result of ALCO's development of a new diesel engine design, the Model 244.  In early 1944, development started on the new design, and by November 1945, the first engines were beginning to undergo tests.  This unusually short testing sequence was brought about by the decision of ALCO's senior management that the engine and an associated line of road locomotives had to be introduced no later than the end of 1946.\nIn preparation for this deadline, by January 1946, the first four locomotives with the 244 engines had been built. Two FA-1s and an FB-1 were painted in ALCO Demonstrator colors and were released for road tests for a month and a half on the Delaware and Hudson Railway.\nA strike at ALCO delayed production beyond the first four units and the three demonstrator units began working on the Gulf, Mobile, and Ohio Railroad in mid February 1946. The demonstrators were returned to Schenectady when the remainder of the order began delivery in May 1946.\nThe GM&O order was completed in April 1947 for a total of 80 units. Before the end of this production run, ALCO upgraded the generators and traction motors in the locomotives, with the first of these models entering service in February 1947 for the New York Central.\nIn 1950, the Montreal Locomotive Works, an affiliate of ALCO, began production of FAs as well. In the fall of 1950, an upgraded model, the FA-2, was launched. This model featured an uprated Model 244 engine, with an output of 1,600 horsepower. Additionally, the carbody was lengthened, making possible the addition of a steam generator in the A unit to allow for use in passenger service.  Models equipped as such were designated the FPA-2/FPB-2.The first FA-2s were delivered in October 1950 to the Baltimore and Ohio and the Erie.  By this time, however, the cab unit had fallen out of favor due to the greater versatility of road switchers, and US production of the FA line ended in 1956, with Canadian production ending in 1959.From the 1970s until 1999, the Long Island Rail Road used 20 FA units converted into \"power packs\". The traction motors were removed, and original prime movers replaced with 600 horsepower (450 kW) engines/generators solely for supplying Head-end power (HEP). The engineer's control stand was left intact, allowing the engines to be used in push-pull service with other locomotives, which usually lacked HEP.

The Lotus 30 was raced in British races such as Guards Trophy, international races such as Nassau Speed Week that allowed FIA Group 4 \"Sports Car\" class of racing machines, and more importantly, in Can Am series.  These were before the recognition and creation of Group 5, 6 and 7 categories by FIA in 1966.  This explains why Lotus 30 and 40 (the latter was built in 1965) came originally equipped with headlights, tail lights and a windscreen wiper.\nNotable for its curvilinear fibreglass body work and \"pickle fork\" backbone chassis first seen in the front engine Lotus Elan, On the 30 the layout was reversed and placed the engine behind the driver.  Lotus engineer Len Terry was asked by Chapman to comment on the draft concept and considered it to be so flawed he refused to have anything to do with it.  The Lotus 30 was powered by a 4.7 litre (289 c.i.) Ford V8 engine, the same type as used in the Ford GT40, mated to a 5 speed ZF synchromesh 5DS20 transaxle which was far more reliable than the Colotti transaxle used in the 19B against the torque of the V8.  It used 13 inch wheels and solid disc brakes on each wheel.  The Lotus 30 was regarded as unsuccessful and / or dangerous but when everything was working and nothing broke, the car was incredibly fast.\n\nThe inherent flaws of the engineering became evident as horse power requirements and tire technology of the period evolved and pushed the original design past its intended limits. The problems were mainly related to the torsional rigidity of the backbone chassis and materials available at the time, all of which resulted in chassis and suspension failures. \nJim Clark laboured long with the car, and managed to prise some promising results with it before it was replaced with the Lotus 40. Equipped with 15in wheels and vented disc brakes as well as a larger engine, the 40 was just as recalcitrant as the 30. The most telling comment about these Lotus race cars was made by the American driver Richie Ginther. When asked what he thought of the new Lotus 40, Ginther, a lugubrious Californian, said, \"Same as the 30 but with ten more mistakes\".\nThe effort was not a total loss as this chassis type proved to be perfectly acceptable for the lower powered Lotus Europa, and was used on the Esprit series cars with further development.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Orders were placed with the RNAS Experimental Flight at Eastchurch and the Marine Aircraft Experimental Department at Port Victoria on the Isle of Grain for single prototypes to meet this requirement.G.H. Millar, the chief technical officer of the Eastchurch flight, designed a small, angular, single-bay biplane, named the Eastchurch Kitten, powered by the required 45 hp (34 kW) ABC Gnat engine.  It was larger and heavier than the Isle of Grain design, with equi-span upper and lower wings, which had bracing wires that ran from the wings through the undercarriage axle to the opposite wing. Initially it had no fixed horizontal tailplane, being fitted with a balanced elevator. Armament was a single Lewis gun mounted to the top wing.The Eastchurch Kitten was part built when Harry Busteed, the commander of the Eastchurch Experimental Flight, was posted to the Isle of Grain to take command of the Marine Aircraft Experimental Department, taking Millar and the part built Eastchurch Kitten with him to Port Victoria for completion.The Eastchurch Kitten was given the designation P.V.8, with the competing Port Victoria designed P.V.7, named the Grain Kitten, flying first in June 1917. The Eastchurch Kitten did not fly until 7 September 1917, powered by a 35 hp (26 kW) ungeared Gnat engine, as the originally planned engine was unavailable.  After this first flight, when it was found to be unstable, it was fitted with a small fixed tailplane with revised elevators. Thus modified, it had superior performance and handling to the Grain Kitten, but was similarly plagued by the terrible unreliability of the Gnat. Official testing praised the view for the pilot and the handling but considered the aircraft too fragile for regular use.No orders followed, with adapted versions of the Sopwith Camel, operating both from aircraft carriers and from lighters towed behind destroyers being used instead.

The innovation introduced with Old Forester was not that it was available in such bottles, but that it was the first bourbon to be exclusively available in this fashion \u2013 providing a greater level of assurance of quality for that brand relative to other products in the market. This innovation was enabled and further fueled by emerging advances in the mass production of glass bottles, such as those soon to be developed by Michael Owens. The sealed bottle approach was popular with doctors and with the pharmacists that sold the product, and their approval was touted in advertisements of the product to the general public.Originally, the product name was spelled \"Old Forrester\", with a double \"r\". The product is reported to have been named after a physician Dr. William Forrester who endorsed its consumption, and the renaming is conjectured to have been a way to avoid direct reference to the physician's name. Originally formed by George Garvin Brown and his half-brother John Thompson Street Brown (J.T.S. Brown, who would also later figure into the history of the Four Roses Distillery and inspire the naming of a brand of bourbon produced by Heaven Hill Distilleries), the company that produces the product was originally registered as J. T. S. Brown & Bro., and became Brown\u2013Forman in 1902 after several partnerships and name changes involving partners James Thompson (who was also involved in the Glenmore Distillery Company and created the Old Thompson brand), Henry Chambers, and George Forman. George Garvin Brown became sole owner by 1902, and although Brown\u2013Forman is now a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, the Brown family still controls more than 70% of the voting shares (as of 2010).To produce his Old Forester product, Brown would initially purchase whiskies from distillers such as John McDougal Atherton and Ben Mattingly, and blend them together. In 1902, he then purchased Mattingly's distillery in the town of Saint Mary in Marion County, Kentucky.Until Prohibition in the United States began in 1920, Old Forester was the leading brand produced by Brown's company. The company was granted one of the few government licenses to produce medical whiskey, at which time the product became a straight bourbon at 100 proof (previously it had been a blended product).Since then, other brands were acquired by the company, such as Early Times (purchased in 1923, which became America's best-selling bourbon and maintained high sales for 30 years), and Jack Daniel's (purchased in 1956 and as of 2007 the best-selling whiskey of any kind in the world), have become its leading products.Every year since 2002, Old Forester releases a Birthday Bourbon expression, made available exclusively through a national sweepstakes. The winners are chosen on September 2, to commemorate the day of Brown's birth.In August 2016, Old Forester announced the release of its 115-proof \"1920 Prohibition Style Bourbon\". In 2021, the company announced its latest expression, known as the 117 Series, or the \"High Angels' Share\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

With this design Lotus sought to position itself upmarket and move away from its kit-car past. The Elite was announced in May 1974. It replaced the ageing Lotus Elan Plus 2.\nThe Elite has a shooting brake body style, with a glass rear hatch opening into the luggage compartment. The Elite's fibreglass bodyshell was mounted on a steel backbone chassis evolved from the Elan and Europa. It had 4-wheel independent suspension using coil springs. The Elite was the first Lotus automobile to use the aluminium-block 4-valve, DOHC, four-cylinder Type 907 engine that displaced 1,973 cc (120.4 cu in) and was rated at 155 hp (116 kW). With this engine the car does 0\u201360 mph (0\u201397 km/h) in 8.1 seconds and reaches a top speed of 125 mph (201 km/h). (The 907 engine had previously been used in Jensen-Healeys.) The 907 engine ultimately became the foundation for the 2.0 L and 2.2 L Esprit power-plants, the naturally aspirated 912 and the turbocharged 910. The Elite was fitted with a 4 or 5-speed manual transmission depending on the customer specifications. Beginning in January 1976, an automatic transmission was optional.\nThe Elite had a claimed drag co-efficient of 0.30 and at the time of launch, it was the world's most expensive four-cylinder car. The Elite's striking shape was designed by Oliver Winterbottom. He is quoted as saying that the basic chassis and suspension layout were designed by Colin Chapman, making the Elite and its sister design the Eclat the last Lotus road cars to have significant design input from Chapman himself.The Elite was available in four main variations, set apart by equipment levels: 501, 502, 503, and later on 504.  \n\n501 - \"Base\" version.\n502 - Added air-conditioning to the base model.\n503 - Added air-conditioning and power-steering.\n504 - Added air-conditioning, power-steering and automatic transmission.The Elite was the basis for the Eclat, and the later Excel 2+2 coup\u00e9s.\nAlthough larger and more luxurious than previous Lotus road cars, the Elite and \u00c9clat are relatively light, with kerb weights not much over 2,300 lb (1,043 kg).\nIn 1980 the Type 75 was replaced by the Type 83, also called the Elite Mark 2. This version received a larger 2,174 cc (132.7 cu in) Lotus 912 engine. The chassis was now galvanised steel and the five speed BMC gearbox was replaced by a Getrag Type 265 unit. The vacuum-operated headlights of the earlier model were replaced with electrically operated units and the Elite was now fitted with a front spoiler, a new rear bumper and brake lights from the Rover SD1.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The other is more similar to the final result, but the front of the train includes more red and no grey paint at all. VR finally settled to a combination of both of them, which bore resemblance to the company's InterCity livery. The bottom of the carriages is dark grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the carriages is painted grey. Red colouring at the end of each car forms red parallelograms when the carriages are combined. When asked why the trains were not blue and white, VR's CEO answered that red and white fits the train and its design the best.The trains were originally marked with only a V instead of the full VR logo to symbolise the company's high speed transport. The same logo was also used on the Sr2 locomotive. The text \"Pendolino S220\" was written on the units according to the train's original branding. On later units, VR's logo was fully painted (the same happened with the Sr2) and \"S220\" dropped.Since 2009, VR has been repainting its fleet in new colours according to its changed visual identity. Green colour has replaced red, and each car now has two green parallelograms instead of one larger figure between carriages. Artwork showcasing Finnish nature decorates them.

As the P-series had not then been certified by the FCC, Commodore were threatened with legal action and were forced to recall them. It was rumored that all recalled P-series machines were destroyed, however a handful of them are known to exist in private collections. At least one model, the P500, was commercially released in Europe but only sold in small numbers.\nThe most common of the B-series was the low-profile B128 (called the CBM 610 in Europe), which had 128 kilobytes of RAM. The B128 did not sell well, and ultimately Commodore's inventory was liquidated by Protecto Enterprizes, a large Commodore mail order dealer based in Chicago, Illinois. The Protecto ads for the B128 bundle, including a dual disk drive, monitor and printer, appeared in various computer magazines for several years.\nThe CBM-II line sold poorly and ended up being extremely expensive to manufacture, as well as difficult to develop software for. Commodore did not release any sales figures or an official discontinuation date, however the B128/600 is the most common model in the lineup. Production ended at some point during 1984 and Commodore liquidated their remaining inventory in 1985. CBM-IIs were still being sold in Germany up to 1987. The exact number of CBM-IIs produced is unclear, however serial numbers indicate that at least 10,000 B128s were shipped along with a few dozen to a few thousand of the other models. It is believed that Commodore produced at least 5000\u20136000 of each machine.\nAfter discontinuing the CBM-II range, Commodore handed its documentation, schematics, and all other information over to CBUG, the Chicago B128 Users Group.\nAmong these materials was a prototype motherboard using an Intel 8088 processor, which hints at the possibility the line could have been made IBM compatible if production had continued.CBUG went on to develop a library of software for the computers. Its library, however, paled in comparison to the large software libraries enjoyed by the Commodore 64 and VIC-20.\nThe rounded case design of the high-profile CBM-II series would later be used in redesigned versions of the original PET/CBM computers, (such as the CBM8296) that the CBM-II line was designed to replace. In addition, the memory banking scheme of the CBM-II would be reused on the Commodore 128 with a few slight modifications.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In practice, the VE-7's performance was much better than usual for a trainer, and the Army ordered 1,000 of an improved design called the VE-8. However, the contract was cancelled due to the end of the war.However, the Navy was very interested in the VE-7, and received the first machine in May 1920. Production orders soon followed, and in accordance to Navy policy at the time, examples were also built by the Naval Aircraft Factory. In all, 128 VE-7s were built.\nThe fighter version of the VE-7 was designated VE-7S. It was a single-seater, the front cockpit being faired over and a .30 in (7.62 mm) Vickers machine gun mounted over it on the left side and synchronized to fire through the propeller. Some planes, designated VE-7SF, had flotation gear consisting of inflatable bags stowed away, available to help keep the plane afloat when ditching at sea.The Bluebird won the 1918 Army competition for advanced training machines.The VE-8 variant completed in July 1919 had a 340hp Wright-Hispano H engine, reduced overall dimensions, increased wing area, a shorter faired cabane, and two Vickers guns. Two were completed. Flight test results were disappointing, the aircraft was overweight, with heavy controls, inadequate stability and sluggish performance.The VE-9 variant, first delivered to the Navy on 24 June 1922, was essentially an improved VE-7, with most of the improvements in the fuel system area.

One VIP order was made in 2007 but later cancelled by Airbus. The A380F version attracted 27 orders, before they were either cancelled (20) or converted to A380-800 (7) following the production delay and the subsequent suspension of the freighter programme.\nDelivery takes place in Hamburg for customers from Europe and the Middle East and in Toulouse for customers from the rest of the world. EADS explained that deliveries in 2013 were to be slowed temporarily to accommodate replacement of the wing rib brackets where cracks were detected earlier in the existing fleet.In 2013, in expectation of raising the number of orders placed, Airbus announced \"attractable discounts\" to airlines who placed large orders for the A380. Soon after, at the November 2013 Dubai Air Show, Emirates ordered 150 777X and Etihad Airways ordered 50 aircraft, totalling $20 billion.In late July 2014, Airbus announced that it had terminated five A380 firm orders from the Japanese low-cost carrier, Skymark Airlines, citing concerns over the airline's financial performance. In 2016, the largest Japanese carrier, All Nippon Airways (ANA), took over three of the orders and the remaining two that were already produced and put into long-term storage were taken up later by the main customer, Emirates Airlines. Qantas planned to order eight more aircraft but froze its order while the airline restructured its operations. Qantas eventually cancelled its order in February 2019 amid doubts over the A380's future.Amedeo, an aircraft lessor that ordered 20 A380s, had not found a client for the airliner and eventually cancelled their order in 2019.Virgin Atlantic ordered six A380s in 2001 but never took delivery and later cancelled them in 2018.In June 2017, Emirates had 48 orders outstanding, but due to lack of space in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and would not take any in 2019\u201320 before replacing its early airliners from 2021.

Most of the civil Plus Cs and Ds were impressed into Royal Air Force service, the Plus Cs were re-engined with the Cirrus Minor I and re-designated as Plus C2.\nPre-war tests identified the Taylorcraft Model D as the most suitable aircraft for the AOP role.  Three more Ds were purchased from Taylorcraft and a trials unit, D Flight, under Major Charles Bazeley RA, formed at Old Sarum on 1 February 1940. The flight with three Austers and one Stinson 105, and three artillery and one RAF pilots, moved to France where they trained with artillery and practiced fighter avoidance with Hurricanes of Air Component before moving south to train with French artillery. The flight did not participate in the fighting and withdrew without loss to the UK. However, the War Office then ordered 100 Stinson L-1 Vigilants. Formation of the RAF's Army Cooperation Command in December 1940 led to the RAF rejecting the very notion of light AOP aircraft.\nIntercession by General Alan Brooke led to an accommodation that led to the first AOP pilot course for artillery officers taking place in October 1940 and in 1941, the first AOP squadron, No 651, formed. Stinson Vigilants eventually arrived in early 1942 but most had been severely damaged in transit leading to the adoption of the Taylorcraft Auster 1 and an order for 100 aircraft placed.

In addition to widespread unserviceability and maintenance problems, the Tu-22's handling characteristics proved to be dangerous. Its landing speed was 100 km/h (60 mph) greater than previous bombers and it had a tendency to pitch up and strike its tail upon landing. It was difficult to fly, and had poor all-round visibility. In 1962, Tupolev commenced work on major update of the Tu-22. Initially, the bureau planned to add a variable-sweep wing and uprated engines into the updated design. The design was tested at TsAGI's wind tunnels at Zhukovsky.During this time Sukhoi developed the T-4, a four-engine titanium aircraft with canards. A response to the XB-70, it was to have a cruise speed of 3,200 km/h (2,000 mph), requiring a major research effort in order to develop the requisite technologies. Tupolev, whose expertise was with bombers, offered the Soviet Air Force (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, VVS) a massively updated version of the Tu-22.Compared to the T-4, it was an evolutionary design, and thus its appeal lay in its simplicity and low cost. The Soviet government was skeptical about the need to approve the development of a replacement aircraft so soon after the Tu-22 had entered service. The Air Force and Tupolev, in order to save face regarding the Tu-22's operational deficiencies and to stave off criticisms from the ICBM lobby, agreed to pass off the design as an update of the Tu-22 in their discussions with the government. The aircraft was designated Tu-22M, given the OKB code \"Aircraft 45\", and an internal designation of \"AM\". Their effort was successful as the government approved the design on 28 November 1967, and decreed the development of the aircraft's main weapon, the Kh-22 missile. The T-4 itself made its first flight in 1972, but was later cancelled.US intelligence had been aware of the existence of the aircraft since 1969, and the first satellite photograph of the bomber was taken in 1970. The existence of the aircraft was a shock to US intelligence as Nikita Khrushchev, who had been the Soviet premier up to 1964, was adamant that ICBMs would render the bomber obsolete.As in the case of its contemporaries, the MiG-23 and Su-17 projects, the advantages of variable-sweep wing (or \"swing wing\") seemed attractive, allowing a combination of short take-off performance, efficient cruising, and good high-speed, low-level flight. The result was a new swing-wing aircraft named Samolyot 145 (Aeroplane 145), derived from the Tupolev Tu-22, with some features borrowed from the abandoned Tu-98 project. The Tu-22M was based on the Tu-22's weapon system and used its Kh-22 missile. The Tu-22M designation was used to help get approval for the bomber within the Soviet military and government system.The Tu-22M designation was used by the Soviet Union during the SALT II arms control negotiations, creating the impression that it was a modification of the Tu-22. Some suggested that the designation was deliberately deceptive, and intended to hide the Tu-22M's performance. Other sources suggest the \"deception\" was internal to make it easier to get budgets approved. According to some sources, the Backfire-B/C production variants were believed to be designated Tu-26 by Russia, although this is disputed by many others. The US State and Defense Departments have used the Tu-22M designation for the Backfire.Production of all Tu-22M variants totalled 497, including pre-production aircraft.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The exterior changes were accompanied by a redesign of the interior that gave more space to the occupants. The revised Esprit was not given a new \"Series\" number but is often called by its project code of X180.\nPanels for the body were produced using a new process called VARI (Vacuum Assisted Resin Injection). This method, which was patented by Lotus, offered advantages over the previous hand lay-up process. Kevlar reinforcement was added to the roof and sides for roll-over protection. This contributed to a 22% increase in the Esprit's torsional rigidity. The new rectangular taillights were borrowed over from the 1983-1985 Toyota Corolla Levin AE86.\n\nThe X180 cars inherited most of their mechanical components from the earlier HC Esprit and Turbo Esprit, although the name for the forced induction model was now Esprit Turbo. 1988 model year North American Esprit Turbo models kept the Citro\u00ebn transaxle and Bosch fuel injection system used in the previous model year.

Early sales were mostly to people who were sympathetic to local manufacturers and who were willing to endure many failures. To support them, design engineers from the factory were often sent to do repairs in order to learn which parts needed the most attention.

Production of Hudson and Essex cars continued to hold third place for 1927, fourth place in 1928, and returned to capture third in 1929 with a total of 300,962 units.The automaker decided to move upmarket and in 1930 launched a line of cars named Great Eight.

Hudson Eights were \"often luxurious, and usually smooth, effortless performers\" powered by a new for 1930 straight-eight engine that would be produced through 1952.

{"id": "176_841", "question": "Which company is Lotus 79 produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_58926", "text": "The Lotus 79's ground effects aerodynamics were pioneered in its immediate predecessor, the Lotus 78. The undercar pressure problems in the 78 were resolved with the 79, with further design work on the venturi tunnels under the car, which allowed the low pressure area to be evenly spaced along the whole of the underside. This was achieved by extending the rear bodywork to a point inside the rear wheel suspension system, allowing the underside to extend further back, instead of ending abruptly in front of the rear wheels as on the 78. As a result, the rear suspension was also redesigned to allow the air to exit the rear more cleanly than on its predecessor. This allowed a smaller rear wing to be used, lowering drag. When the car first appeared, the upper bodywork was steeply raked and featured \"Coke bottle\" sidepods. After work in the wind tunnel, these features were found to be unnecessary, as the car generated so much downforce anyway. These features were, however, later incorporated into the Lotus 80. In all, five chassis were built during the design's lifetime, with the prototype 79/1 later sold to H\u00e9ctor Rebaque to race as a privateer entrant.The car was powered by the Ford Cosworth DFV and constructed of sheet aluminium honeycomb, specially strengthened for the pressures exerted on the car by the ground effect. The fuel tank was one single cell behind the driver, as opposed to the separate fuel tanks on the previous Lotus 78. This had the advantage of increasing fire protection and returning the centre of gravity to the middle of the car, helping cornering and braking. The 79 was also the first F1 car to be designed using computer design aids. In fact, it was the first F1 car to use computers to analyse it in the pits on race weekends.\nThe car was secretly tested in late 1977 by Ronnie Peterson and proved extremely fast, but the chassis suffered early fatigue due to the severe suction and g-forces generated by the ground effect. The 79 produced about 30% more downforce than the 78, something not foreseen by Ogilvie and Rudd, who went back to the drawing board. The chassis was strengthened in specific points, mostly around the monocoque and load bearing points on the chassis tub, and the car was found to be even faster than before.The need for smooth airflow dictated the car must have clean lines. Nicknamed \"Black Beauty\" by the press and F1 fans alike, for its graceful design and sleek profile and its black and gold livery through sponsorship by John Player Special cigarettes, the Lotus 79 was instantly competitive on its debut, the 1978 Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder. It took the pole position at the hands of Mario Andretti by more than a second, and went on to win the race comfortably. Andretti said after driving the 79 for the first time that, in comparison, the Lotus 78 was \"like driving a London bus\". Peterson once quipped, after scoring an impressive pole position, that the car was so brilliantly set up, all he had to do was steer.The 79 was not without its problems, however. Wright and Ogilvie noted that the car was very marginal in some aspects of its design. Andretti had reservations over the car's brakes, which faded noticeably over a race distance, especially in hot conditions; the exhaust had a tendency to overheat, and the monocoque tub was not as stiff as the team would have liked, which meant a new casting had to be fabricated several times during the two seasons the car was used.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The low compression 30 hp (22 kW) R60/2, produced from 1955 to 1960, was designed primarily for sidecar use, though it was popularly used as a solo bike, along with the 30 hp R60US, which was produced between 1968 and 1969.\nThe sport-oriented R69S, R69US, and R69 succeeded the plunger-framed 1951 to 1955 R68, which had an engine very similar to that in the later R69.\nThe R69US models, with telescopic forks, which were used later on the BMW R-/5 series motorcycles, were introduced in the United States for the 1968 model year and then continued for 1969. Front and rear side reflectors, demanded by the U. S. Department of Transportation, were introduced only for the 1969 model year, along with a DOT sticker that was placed on the rear fender. The previous Earles fork continued to be offered during these years.\nIn June 1962, Cycle World magazine published a review of the R69S. Its initial and concluding paragraphs read:\n\nAsk any motorcyclist what he considers to be the two-wheeled equivalent of the Rolls-Royce and you will almost certainly be told \"BMW\". That answer will not be too far wrong, either, except that the products coming from the Bayerische Motoren Werke incorporate a good deal more in advanced engineering features than the famous English car. Actually, the BMW motorcycle is more like the Mercedes than a Rolls-Royce: conservative in many respects, but quite advanced nonetheless. In any case, the BMW has attributes that make it unique, and it has acquired a reputation that makes it a \"prestige\" motorcycle \u2014 even among people who ordinarily don't give two wheelers a second glance.\nWhatever the BMW's merits in a contest of speed, it is still the smoothest, best finished, quietest and cleanest motorcycle it has ever been our pleasure to ride. To be honest, we think that anyone who would worry much over its performance-potential is a bit of a booby. The R69S is fast enough to handle any encounter, and it has attributes that are, in touring, infinitely more valuable than mere speed. All things considered, if we were planning a two-wheel style vacation/tour, the BMW would have to be our choice of mount.", "hasanswer": false}]}

For example, Pro added BitLocker, Hyper-V, the ability to join a domain, and the ability to install Windows Media Center as a paid add-on. Users of Windows 8 can purchase a \"Pro Pack\" license that upgrades their system to Windows 8 Pro through Add features to Windows. This license also includes Windows Media Center. Windows 8 Enterprise contains additional features aimed towards business environments, and is only available through volume licensing. A port of Windows 8 for ARM architecture, Windows RT, is marketed as an edition of Windows 8, but was only included as pre-loaded software on devices specifically developed for it.Windows 8 was distributed as a retail box product on DVD, and through a digital download that could be converted into DVD or USB install media. From its launch until January 31, 2013, as part of a launch promotion, Microsoft offered Windows 8 Pro upgrades at a discounted price of US$39.99 online, or $69.99 for a retail box; afterward the Windows 8 price has been $119.99 and the Pro price $199.99.

First customer delivery, as of March 2009, was originally planned to take approximately 18 months and occur in 2011.On July 1, 2010, it was announced that the Terrafugia Transition had been granted an exemption from the FAA concerning its Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW), allowing the Transition to be certified with a take-off weight up to 1,430 pounds (650 kg); the limit matches the MTOW for amphibious light-sport aircraft. The extra 110 pounds (50 kg) granted by the exemption provides more weight allowance for the mandatory road safety features such as airbags and bumpers.\nThe proposed design of the production version was made by Danish designer Jens Martin Skibsted and his partners at KiBiSi and made public at AirVenture Oshkosh on July 26, 2010.  Aerodynamic changes revealed included a new, optimized airfoil, Hoerner wingtips, and removal of the canard after it was found to have an adverse aerodynamic interaction with the front wheel suspension struts; furthermore, the multipurpose passenger vehicle classification from the NHTSA removed the requirement for a full width bumper that had inspired the original canard design.On November 16, 2010, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published Terrafugia's petition for a temporary, three-year hardship exemption from four FMVSS standards in the Transition. Terrafugia requested to use lighter weight motorcycle tires instead of RV tires, polycarbonate for the windshield and side windows, basic airbags instead of advanced, dual stage airbags and to not include an electronic stability control system. \nThe NHTSA granted all of the requested exemptions on June 29, 2011, but limited the stability control and airbag exemptions to one year.In June 2011, a delay was announced and Terrafugia's CEO estimated that about another 18 months would be required before first customer delivery in \"late 2012\", but this was not achieved. December 2011 saw the base price increase to US$279,000 from an initial price of US$194,000.After undergoing drive tests and high-speed taxi tests, the production prototype completed its first flight on March 23, 2012, at the same airport in Plattsburgh, New York, that was used for the Proof of Concept's flight testing. The production prototype then made its auto show debut at the 2012 New York International Auto Show in April 2012.In June 2012, Terrafugia announced that the Transition had completed the first of six phases of flight testing.  By July, the second phase of testing was underway, expanding the performance envelope in the sky and continuing drive testing on the ground.In January 2013, development continued and the company announced that it might be necessary to construct a third, completely new prototype, due to the large number of modifications required. The modifications to date are said to appear to have improved the previous handling characteristics.By March 2014, the design of the third, updated prototype had progressed to finalization of the major structural members and a statement to investors said that it would be used in final compliance testing for certification before the first customer delivery which was then estimated to take at least another 18 months and occur \"in 2015\".By April 2014, 12 two-person test flights had taken place; this was the first time that anyone other than Terrafugia's chief test pilot had flown the Transition.  As of 22 August 2014, first customer delivery was hoped for in about 18 months \"in the second quarter of 2016.\"In December 2014 the company asked the FAA to allow the Transition to be operated at a gross weight of 1,800 lb (816 kg) instead of the light-sport aircraft maximum weight of 1,320 lb (599 kg) and have a stall speed of 54 kn (100 km/h; 62 mph) instead of the category maximum of 45 kn (83 km/h; 52 mph). The company indicated that the increases were required to allow inclusion of structures to meet FMVSS ground operation safety regulations. The company had previously been granted an increase in gross weight of 110 lb (50 kg) and another LSA aircraft, the ICON A5, was granted a 250 lb (113 kg) exemption to meet FAA spin resistance requirements; this new application would increase the Transition's allowed weight by a total of 480 lb (218 kg) or 36%. During consultations the request for the weight increase was supported by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the Experimental Aircraft Association, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and the Light Aircraft Manufacturers Association. Only a few individuals expressed opposition to the request. The exemption was granted by the FAA on 19 June 2016.In April 2015 the company announced that parts were being built for the third version of the aircraft, and that current planning estimated the first customer delivery after roughly two years.  Terrafugia COO/VP of Engineering Kevin Colburn also stated that the company has changed the price estimate from $279K to between $300K and $400K.In November 2015, the company announced that the third version of the Transition was being tested with a Rotax 912is engine, rather than the Rotax 912ULS that the second prototype had flown with.As of April 2017, the company's website says: \"Today, Terrafugia is finalizing production vehicle design and compliance testing in preparation for vehicle deliveries within the next three years.\"As of November 2017, media reports suggested a 2019 delivery date for the first vehicles.In April 2018, the production prototype (\"D2\") was retired. While the original proof of concept vehicle had flown only about 8 hours in total, the production prototype had logged 212 flight hours, completing 317 takeoffs and landings.In July 2018 the company announced a series of upgrades that will be incorporated in the production aircraft with delivery planned for July 2019. These include a hybrid-electric motor and lithium iron phosphate battery for road mode use, a Dynon electronic flight instrument system, a Ballistic Recovery Systems ballistic parachute, an inflight power boost feature, a remodeled interior, increased cargo space, improved seat belt design, airbags, plus three rearview cameras.In January 2021, Terrafugia announced that the Transition received a Special Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA) airworthiness certificate from the FAA for the Transition to be flown only, with road use approval to follow in 2022.In February 2021, it was reported that Terrafugia had laid off most of their employees and would close down operations in the United States later in the year, with the intention of moving to China.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Both were issues with all his previous 4-6-0s and made them unpopular to locomotive crews.\nIn service, all were based at Nine Elms from new and were used exclusively on expresses to Bournemouth and Salisbury. However, the class struggled on these 'racing stretches.' This was especially true in the case of the tightly timed Salisbury workings. With intermediate stops at Surbiton and Woking, a D15 was the preferred motive power because they kept better time than a T14.\nIn consequence, they were utilised on the LSWR 'top link' for only 8 years, and were promptly replaced upon grouping in 1923 by Maunsell's N15s as they became available. However, their potential in secondary duties allowed Maunsell to attempt to fix the problems with the original design. Superheating helped to solve the problems of efficiency in terms of coal and water, whilst the removal of the splashers meant ease of access to the wheels and airflow to the axleboxes.The first withdrawal took place in 1940 when 458 suffered air raid damage at Nine Elms shed. The rest continued into public ownership in 1948.  However, the remainder continued to be withdrawn from November 1948, and the last one surviving until June 1951.

The success of the 2-6-0 in traversing this route was due to their higher-capacity tapered boilers that produced an ample supply of steam, and the small 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m) driving wheels that delivered considerable tractive effort when climbing gradients such as the 1 in 100 between Gomshall and Shalford.After \"The Grouping\" in 1923, the N class remained on the former SECR network, which was incorporated into the Southern Railway's Eastern section. Typical services included Ramsgate, Ashford and Hither Green freights, and Cannon Street to Dover passenger trains. In early 1924 Nos. A815 and A825 were transferred to the former LSWR mainline between Waterloo and Guildford for trials. These proved successful, and paved the way for the allocation of most of the Woolwich batch to the Southern Railway's Western section. The type regularly replaced Dugald Drummond's ageing LSWR T9 class 4-4-0s on portions of the Atlantic Coast Express over the steeply graded mainlines west of Exeter.The N class was also successful on the Central section, where they worked alongside L. B. Billinton's LB&SCR K class 2-6-0s. However the large cylinder and cab sizes of the N class prevented use of the type on the Eastern section's Tonbridge\u2013Hastings line. The route's narrow bridges and tunnels were unable to accommodate the class, and provided justification for using the narrower 3-cylinder N1 class 2-6-0 on the route. Despite these restrictions, the class was capable of hauling heavy loads at moderate speeds, a useful attribute that was exploited throughout the Second World War. The entire class came into British Railways' ownership in 1948 and could be seen in most areas of the Southern Region.", "hasanswer": false}]}

By the end of the 1950s, familiar brand names of home organs in addition to Hammond included Conn, Kimball, Lowrey, and others, while companies such as Allen and Rodgers manufactured large electronic organs designed for church and other public settings.\nWhat would later become the Yamaha Electone emerged as a prototype concept in 1958, then named \"E-T\". The Electone series finally made its commercial debut in 1959 with the D-1, a home instrument. By 1980, with the market waning sharply, and some manufacturers ceasing production, the Electone line embraced digital technology. This allowed Electone's survival as the traditional home electronic organ market dried up. The product name \"Electone\", coined from the word \"Electronic\" and \"Tone\", would become so popular in Japan that in later years, it would become a way to refer to electronic organs in general in the country.\nElectones built until 1983 were often similar in specifications to a small Theater organ, with a main flute group analogous to the Tibia Clausa, strings (usually at 8' and 4'), and multiple reeds at 16' and 8' pitches.\nStarting with the D-3, Electones featured theatre organ-style color coding for the tone levers.\nUnlike Theater organs however, the tone levers could be individually made louder, similar to a drawbar organ. This essentially crossed the two instruments together. \nBy the 1980s, many of the most famous names had ceased home production, but the Electone had successfully transitioned into the modern world of digital synthesizers.\nThe FE, and FX lines introduced in 1983, marked a transition from Theater organ styled instruments, with push buttons being used for selecting sounds, instead of tone levers, which would be carried over to future models and lines afterwards.\nIt would come to compete with new products from  Moog Music, Wersi, and later Kurzweil.

Its acronymous name was changed to upper- and lower-case Fiat in 1906. Agnelli led the company until his death in 1945, while Vittorio Valletta administered the firm's daily activities. Its first car, the 3 \u00bd CV, of which only 24 copies were built, all bodied by Alessio of Turin, strongly resembled contemporary Benz, and had a 697 cc (42.5 cu in) boxer twin engine. In 1903, Fiat produced its first truck. In 1908, the first Fiat was exported to the US. That same year, the first Fiat aircraft engine was produced. Also around the same time, Fiat taxis became popular in Europe.By 1910, Fiat was the largest automotive company in Italy \u2014 a position it has retained since. That same year, a new plant was built in Poughkeepsie, NY, by the newly founded American F.I.A.T. Automobile Company. Owning a Fiat at that time was a sign of distinction. The cost of a Fiat in the US was initially $4,000 and rose up to $6,400 in 1918, compared to $825 for a Ford Model T in 1908, and $525 in 1918, respectively. During World War I, Fiat had to devote all of its factories to supplying the Allies with aircraft, engines, machine guns, trucks, and ambulances. Upon the entry of the US into the war in 1917, the factory was shut down as US regulations became too burdensome. After the war, Fiat introduced its first tractor, the 702. By the early 1920s, Fiat had a market share in Italy of 80%.In 1921, workers seized Fiat's plants and hoisted the red flag of communism over them. Agnelli responded by quitting the company. However, the Italian Socialist Party and its ally organization, the Italian General Confederation of Labour, in an effort to effect a compromise with the centrist parties ordered the occupation ended. In 1922, Fiat began to build the famous Lingotto car factory\u2014then the largest in Europe\u2014which opened in 1923. It was the first Fiat factory to use assembly lines; by 1925, Fiat controlled 87% of the Italian car market. In 1928, with the 509, Fiat included insurance in the purchase price.Fiat made military machinery and vehicles during World War II for the Italian army and Regia Aeronautica and later for the Germans. Fiat made fighter aircraft like the biplane CR.42 Falco, which was one of the most common Italian aircraft, along with Savoia-Marchettis, as well as light tanks, obsolete compared to their German and Soviet counterparts, and armoured vehicles. The best Fiat aircraft was the G.55 fighter, which arrived too late and in too limited numbers to impact the outcome of the war.\nIn 1945, the National Liberation Committee removed the Agnelli family from leadership roles in Fiat because of its ties to Mussolini's government. These were not returned until 1963, when Giovanni's grandson, Gianni, took over as general manager until 1966 and as chairman until 1996.Fiat launched a nuclear research program in the 1950s.

{"id": "176_891", "question": "Which company is Panasonic Q produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_59029", "text": "The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer was originally conceived by The 3DO Company, founded in September 12, 1991 by Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins. The company's objective was to create a next-generation, CD-based video game/entertainment standard which would be manufactured by various partners and licensees; 3DO would collect a royalty on each console sold and on each game manufactured. To game publishers, the low US$3 royalty rate per game was a better deal than the higher royalties paid to Nintendo and Sega when making games for their consoles. The 3DO hardware itself was designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical (designers of the Amiga and Atari Lynx), starting from an outline on a restaurant napkin in 1989. Trip Hawkins was a long-time acquaintance of Needle and Mical and found that their design very closely fit his philosophy for architecture and approach, so he decided that: \"Rather than me start a brand new team and starting from scratch it just made a lot of sense to ... join forces with them and shape what they were doing into what I wanted it to be.\"The 3DO Company lacked the resources to manufacture consoles, and instead licensed the hardware to other companies for manufacturing. Trip Hawkins recounted that they approached every electronics manufacturer, but that their chief targets were Sony and Panasonic, the two largest consumer electronics companies in the world. However, Sony had already begun development on their own console, the PlayStation, and ultimately decided to continue work on it rather than sign with 3DO. According to former Sega CEO Tom Kalinske The 3DO Company was engaged in very serious talks for Sega to become involved with the 3DO. However, it was passed on by Sega due to concerns over cost. Panasonic launched the 3DO with its FZ-1 model in 1993, though Goldstar and Sanyo would later manufacture the 3DO as well. Companies who obtained the hardware license but never actually sold 3DO units include Samsung, Toshiba, and AT&T, who went so far as to build prototype AT&T 3DO units and display them at the January 1994 Consumer Electronics Show.Licensing to independent manufacturers made the system extremely expensive. The manufacturers had to make a profit on the hardware itself, whereas most major game console manufacturers, such as Sega and Sony, sold their systems at a loss, with expectations of making up for the loss with software sales. The 3DO was priced at US$699, far above competing game systems and aimed at high-end users and early adopters. Hawkins has argued that 3DO was launched at $599, and not \"higher myths that are often reported\". In a later interview, Hawkins clarified that while the suggested retail price was $699, not all retailers sold the system at that price. Goldstar, Sanyo, and Panasonic's later models were less expensive to manufacture than the FZ-1 and were sold for considerably lower prices. For example, the Goldstar model launched at $399. In addition, after six months on the market, the price of the FZ-1 had dropped to $499, leading some to contend that the 3DO's cost was not as big a factor in its market failure as is usually claimed.Hawkins' belief was that the 3DO system could become a dominant standard in a similar way to that achieved by the VHS video cassette format, with several companies being able to promote the standard effectively against individual competitors with their own technologies, such as Sony and Betamax, in the context of VHS. It was also believed that companies would be able to more effectively compete by being able to leverage a common standard, as opposed to having to attract developers to individual formats, with Hawkins noting that this would be \"tough for Atari and Sony\". Indeed, Hawkins believed that the failure of NEC to establish its TurboGrafx system, and yet being \"much bigger than Sony\", illustrated the difficulties faced by new entrants to the console market and thought that Sony, in following the business model of Sega and Nintendo, \"would have had a better chance if it had partnered with some of the others\". Meanwhile, other products were not regarded as competitive threats: the Atari Jaguar was perceived as \"primitive\" and \"slightly better than a 16-bit system\", and the Philips CD-i was regarded as \"really obsolete by today's standards\". Both 3DO and Philips, seeking to pioneer the broader concept of interactive entertainment, aimed to sell in the order of one million units during 1994 and into 1995.Hawkins claimed that the console was HDTV-capable, and that the company could use its technology for a set-top box. It was believed the platform would appeal to cable companies seeking to provide digital interactive services, with broadcasts being accompanied by digital information, eventually leading to the development of video-on-demand services on what was described as a \"client-server interactive network\", with an interactive networking trial having been announced in collaboration with US West in Omaha, Nebraska for the autumn of 1994. Computer Gaming World reported in January 1994 that 3DO \"is poised for an avalanche of software support to appear in the next 12 months\", unlike the Atari Jaguar and Pioneer LaserActive. The magazine predicted that \"If 3DO's licensees can get enough machines and software out in the market, this could very well become the interactive gamer's entry level machine\" and possibly \"the ideal plug and play solution for those of us who are tired of playing circuit board roulette with our personal computers\". Electronic Arts promoted the console in two-page advertisements, describing it as a \"technological leap\" and promising \"twenty new titles ... over the next twelve months\".The launch of the platform in October 1993 received a great deal of attention in the press as part of the \"multimedia wave\" in the computer world at the time. Return Fire, Road Rash, FIFA International Soccer, and Jurassic Park Interactive had been slated for launch releases but were pushed to mid-1994 due to the developers' struggles with the then-cutting-edge hardware. Moreover, the 3DO Company made continued updates to the console hardware almost up to the system's release, which resulted in a number of third-party titles missing the launch date, in some cases by less than a month, because the developers weren't left enough time to fully test them on the finalized hardware. The only 3DO software available at launch was the third-party game Crash 'n Burn. Panasonic also failed to manufacture an ample supply of the console in time for launch day, and as a result most retail stores only received one or two units. By mid-November, the 3DO had sold 30,000 units.The system was released in Japan in March 1994 with an initial lineup of six games. The Japanese launch was moderately successful, with 70,000 units shipping to 10,000 stores. However, sales soon dropped and by 1995 the system was known in Japan as a host for pornographic releases.The 3DO's claim to the title of most advanced console on the market was lost with the 1994 Japanese launches of the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The 3DO Company responded by emphasizing their console's large existing software library, lower price (both the Panasonic and Goldstar models were $299 by this time), and promised successor: the M2. To assure consumers that the 3DO would still be supported, the M2 was initially announced as an add-on for the 3DO. It was later revealed that the M2 would be an entirely separate console, albeit one with 3DO backward compatibility. Eventually the M2 project was cancelled.\nUnlike Panasonic, Goldstar initially produced only 3DO hardware, not software. This made it difficult to manage competitive price drops, and when the price of the Goldstar 3DO dropped to $199 in December 1995, the company took a loss of more than $100 on each sale. Goldstar tried switching to the usual industry model of selling hardware at a loss and profiting on software, but though a handful of Goldstar games were published for the 3DO, Goldstar's software development operation arrived too late to allow them to turn a profit on the 3DO. This lack of a profitable business model, combined with Panasonic acquiring exclusive rights to the M2 technology, were cited as the two chief reasons for Goldstar dropping support for the 3DO in early 1996. During the second quarter of 1996 several of the 3DO's most loyal software supporters, including the software division of The 3DO Company themselves, announced they were no longer making games for the system, leaving Panasonic as the only company supporting active software development for the 3DO.The 3DO system was eventually discontinued towards the end of 1996, with a complete shutdown of all internal hardware development and divestment of the M2 technology. The 3DO Company restructured themselves around this same time, selling off their hardware division to become a multi-platform company focused on software development and online gaming. After selling the Opera hardware to Samsung in 1997, the hardware was revived in South Korea for another 2 years then discontinued again at some point in late 1998 or early 1999. The amount of systems produced after the Samsung buyout is unknown.\nThe initial high price is considered to be one of the many issues that led to the 3DO's failure, along with lack of significant funding that larger companies such as Sony took advantage of. In an interview shortly after The 3DO Company dropped support for the system, Trip Hawkins attributed its failure to the model of licensing all hardware manufacturing and software to third parties. He reasoned that for a console to be a success, it needed a single strong company to take the lead in marketing, hardware, and software, and pointed out that it was essentially a lack of coordination between The 3DO Company, Panasonic, and the 3DO's software developers which had led to the console launching with only one game ready.", "hasanswer": false}]}

For the final Delta retailed between 1996 and 2001, the \"Wide\" suffix disappeared.\nThe LiteAce followed the introduction of the more compact MiniAce and larger HiAce in 1967, acting as an intermediacy between these two models in size and carrying capacity. By the mid-1970s, the MiniAce had been retired and the HiAce had grown, thus creating a void in the market resumed by the TownAce. The \"Ace\" moniker references the Toyota ToyoAce medium-duty truck sold starting 1956. The \"Lite\" in LiteAce refers to its light-duty capability, and the \"Town\" in TownAce alludes to the suitability of the model for urban areas.", "hasanswer": true}]}

When introduced, its 76.2 mm (3 in) tank gun was more powerful than its contemporaries, and its 60-degree sloped armour provided good protection against anti-tank weapons. The T-34 had a profound effect on the conflict on the Eastern Front, and had a long-lasting impact on tank design. The tank was praised by multiple German generals when encountered during Operation Barbarossa, although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war. Its main strength was its cost and production time, meaning that German panzer forces would often fight against Soviet tank forces several times their size. The T-34 is also a critical part of the mechanized divisions that form the backbone of the Deep Battle Strategy.\nThe T-34 was the mainstay of the Soviet Red Army armoured forces throughout the war. Its general specifications remained nearly unchanged until early 1944, when it received a firepower upgrade with the introduction of the greatly improved T-34-85 variant. Its production method was continuously refined and rationalized to meet the needs of the Eastern Front, making the T-34 quicker and cheaper to produce. The Soviets ultimately built over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded despite the loss of tens of thousands in combat against the German Wehrmacht.Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most-produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/T-55 series). With 44,900 lost during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses ever. Its development led directly to the T-44, then the T-54 and T-55 series of tanks, which in turn evolved into the later T-62, that form the armoured core of many modern armies.

The genesis of the 205 lay within Peugeot's takeover in 1978 of Chrysler's European divisions Simca and the former Rootes Group, which had the necessary expertise in making small cars including the Simca 1100 in France and Hillman Imp in Britain. It was around this time that Peugeot began to work on the development of a new supermini for the 1980s.\nIt was launched on 24 February 1983, and was launched in right-hand drive form for the UK market in September that year. Shortly after its launch, it was narrowly pipped to the European Car of the Year award by the similar sized Fiat Uno, but ultimately (according to the award organizers) it would enjoy a better image and a longer high market demand than its Italian competitor. It was one of five important small cars to be launched onto the European market within a year of each other: the other four were the Uno, the second generation Ford Fiesta, the original Opel Corsa (sold as the Vauxhall Nova on the British market) and the original Nissan Micra. Its launch also closely followed that of the Austin Metro and Volkswagen Polo Mk2.\nThe styling of the 205 is often thought to be a Pininfarina design, although Gerard Welter claims that it is an in-house design; Pininfarina only styled the Cabriolet. It is often credited as the car that turned Peugeot's fortunes around.\nThe fully independent suspension used the now standard PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn layout that had debuted in the Peugeot 305 estate. A key ingredient of the success of the 205, it had MacPherson struts at the front and trailing arms with torsion bars at the rear. The rear suspension was very compact, designed to minimise suspension intrusion into the boot, giving a wide flat loadspace, while providing excellent ride and handling.\nEarly 205s used the X petrol engine from the older Peugeot 104, although these were later (1987\u20131988) replaced with the newer XU and TU-series engines, which were of PSA design. Engines ranged in displacement from 954 cc to 1905 cc, in carburettor or fuel injected versions.\nThe diesel models employed the PSA XUD engine, lifted from the Citro\u00ebn BX which was introduced in September 1982. These engines had a capacity of 1769 cc (XUD7) and 1905 cc (XUD9) and are closely related to the XU5 and XU9 petrol engines in the BX16 and BX19 of the time. The diesel engines were world-beating and so petrol-like that many buyers were won over by petrol car performance combined with diesel economy. For instance, the 205 GRD (1.8 Diesel, 59 bhp (44 kW), 78 lb\u22c5ft (105.8 N\u22c5m)) was as fast as, yet smoother than, the 205 GR (1.4 Petrol, 59 bhp (44 kW), 78 lb\u22c5ft (105.8 N\u22c5m)), due to the engine developing peak torque at much lower rpm, while using much less fuel.\n\nThere were various versions intended for commercial use, such as the two-seater XA-series. There was also the \"205 Multi\", a tall-bodied special version on XA or XE-basis built by independent coachbuilders like Gruau and Durisotti. Gruau called their XA-based two-seater version the \"VU\", while the five-seat XE-based version was called the \"VP\".

To date, its exterior significantly changed, although the installation has retained the design of the original serial versions of the systems. Unlike other variants, this one relies on an internal power source. The GDF-009 model is based on a four-wheeled carriage, and is raised off the ground by three stabilisers when deployed in the firing position. It also features an automatic levelling system that can compensate for a maximum tilt angle of up to 7\u00b0.Mounted on the forward part of the carriage is the integrated battery, which functions as the gun's power supply unit and can be recharged from an external source if required.\nAHEAD: An upgrade for the GDF series guns built around a special projectile which explodes at a pre-calculated point in front of the target, sending a cone of 152 tungsten sub-projectiles at the target.

MKE made 35mm guns linked with an Aselsan made Fire and Command Control System. The system has similarities with Skyguard system. The Fire and Command Control System consists of Aselsan made 3D search radar, fire control radar, electro-optical (E/O) sensors and other electronics. Each weapons system can fire up to 1100 rpm (2 x 550rpm) to an effective range of 4 km. The upgradation enables the system to fire Aselsan ATOM 35mm airburst round which explodes at a pre-calculated point in front of the target, sending a cone of tungsten pellets at the target. The gun can also fire HEI and TP-T  ammunitions. The concept of ATOM 35mm air burst ammunition came up in order to increase the efficiency of the gun systems against modern targets including  fixed/rotary wing aircraft, cruise missiles, air-to-ground missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles and other precision guided weapons. Aselsan Fire and Command Control  system can also incorporate a low altitude air defense SAM along with 35 mm gun platform.

Lost out in trials to the tracked-only A-32. The only built prototype is known to have participated in the Battle of Moscow. In 1941, as the Germans neared Moscow, the situation was so desperate that everything battle-worthy was put into service by the Soviets. The A-20 prototype, which at that time was at Kubinka army proving ground near Moscow for evaluation trials, was immediately put into service together with other prototypes of tanks present here, which were organized into a separate company led by Captain Semenov. Later on, the tank was included in the 22nd Tank Brigade organic, together with its predecessors and successors, BT-7 and T-34 tanks. On 1 December 1941, during fighting, the tank was seriously damaged and sent to the rear for repairs. Three days later, it re-entered service with the 22nd Tank Brigade until mid-December, when the tank was again damaged and evacuated to the rear. After these events, its fate is unknown.\n A-32 (A-20G): initially known as the A-20G (G - tracked) and then renamed to A-32, it was the competitor to the A-20. The wheels-and-tracks system was removed for the first time from the BT tanks series, making the tank design and production easier, more reliable and, especially, lighter; in fact, armor was increased to 30 mm, hull was enlarged, 5th road wheel was fitted in for better ground-pressure distribution and the 45 mm 20-K gun was replaced by the 76.2 mm L-10 gun, but the weight increased by only 1 ton (from 18 to 19 tons, respectively for the A-20 and A-32). Trials in 1939 showed that the tank armor could be upgraded and thus a request for increase to 45 mm was made. A second prototype was specially created for the purpose, this time equipped with turret and 45 mm armament from the A-20 and with additional weights placed on special brackets welded on the hull and turret to simulate mass of the up-armored tank. After satisfactory tests, other requests were made, for example to improve the visibility from inside the tank and to adopt the newer F-32 gun (later the L-11 and F-34 were adopted on prototypes and production models instead), which finally lead to the A-34, serial produced as the famous T-34.Foreign variants:\n\nBT-42: Finnish assault gun; captured BT-7s were equipped with British QF 4.5-inch howitzers.

It was a single-seat sport bike based on the Honda CB900F, initially with a 3\u20444 fairing and exposed lower engine. The R suffix denotes a racing version, however the CB1100R was a road-legal machine produced by Honda and offered for sale to the public. It was produced only in numbers sufficient to meet the homologation requirements for the R to be classed as a production motorcycle in markets into which it was sold. It was Honda's first 'homologation special' and was raced in the production class racing in most major markets: including Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. It was not sold in the US.\nIn 1980, the first batch of 110 naked versions were rushed to Australia specifically with the aim of winning the world renowned Castrol 6 Hour race.   The Honda did indeed win with future world champion Wayne Gardner and Australian champion Andrew Johnson riding.  The organisers of the event then prevented the single seat Honda from entering the 1981 Castrol 6 Hour as they deemed it a \"race special\".  In 1981, the CB1100R won the New Zealand Castrol Six Hour ridden by Australian pair of Malcolm Campbell and Mick Cole.  The CB1100R was slightly modified to have a dual seat so as to reclassify it as a road bike, so allowing it to enter the 1982 Castrol 6 Hour, and duly won this premier Australian production race in 1982, the Castrol Six Hour in the hands of future 1987 500cc GP World Champion Wayne Gardner and teammate Wayne Clark. Other CB1100Rs finished the race 2nd, 3rd and 4th, with 6 CB11000Rs finishing in the top 8 spots. The Australasian success of the CB1100R lead directly to the development of the Suzuki GSX1100SXZ Katana homologation racing specials.\nThe model designations are CB1100RB (1980 and 1981), CB1100RC (1982), and CB1100RD (1983). In 1980/81, 1050 units were sold, followed by 1500 per year in 1982 and 1983. The 1981 'RB' was half faired with a solo seat only. The 82 and 83 models have different bodywork including a full fairing, aluminium fuel tank, and pillion seat covered with a removable seat cowl. The 82 (RC) and 83 (RD) were largely similar in appearance, yet with considerable differences what concerns the full fairing and dashboard layout. None of the fairing parts of any of the 3 models are interchangeable with one another. The RC fairing, fairing bracket and dashboard combo was only made for the RC and  does not interchange in any way with the RD, which had a slightly shorter overall length. Other differences include the paint scheme, rear swing arm design and color and front fork design. In 1983 the Honda CB1100F was launched that essentially was a blend of the CB1100R and the CB900F, for a broader market. The 1981 CB1100RB had a claimed 115 hp (86 kW) @ 9000 rpm.\n\n\n== Notes ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

In December of that year, Izumi was deployed on a patrol line south of Dalian Bay after the Japanese cruiser Akashi struck a mine. Later that month, Izumi was sent back to Japan for minor repairs so it would be fit for combat against the approaching Russian Baltic Fleet. When the Japanese deployed their ships for what would later be known as the Battle of Tsushima, a decisive Japanese victory, Izumi was one of four cruisers to make up the Sixth Division within the Third Squadron. These groups were under the commands of Rear Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Masamichi and Vice Admiral Kataoka Shichir\u014d, respectively.\n\nIzumi's pre-battle assigned role was to support a line of auxiliary cruisers stationed in the Tsushima Strait. These ships were charged with spotting the Russian fleet so its Japanese counterpart could move into position to engage. This line was later described by historian Julian Corbett as \"ill-covered,\" and Izumi compounded the issue by being 8\u20139 miles (13\u201314 km) out of position on the morning of the battle (27 May 1905). Moreover, it had trouble finding the Russians after investigating erroneously located spotting reports radioed in by the auxiliary Shinano Maru at 4:45 am.Around 6:30 or 6:40 am, Izumi finally made visual contact with the opposing Russian fleet; it was the first proper warship to do so. Correcting the previously mistaken spotting, Izumi shadowed the Russians for several hours, correctly identifying the lead Russian flagship as a cruiser of the Izumrud class, and reported their movements back to the main Japanese fleet. Izumi also warned off an army hospital ship and a troop transport in the area before they were caught by the Russians.As the two fleets drew near for battle, Izumi was forced to turn away from heavy fire at around 1:50 pm; the change in course allowed it to cut off two of the Russian fleet's hospital ships, which were later captured by two of the Japanese auxiliary cruisers. Later in the battle, when the Japanese main battle line had 'crossed the T' of the Russian fleet and forced it to turn around, Izumi and several other lighter ships from Japanese squadrons were caught in close proximity to heavy Russian ships. Izumi escaped with minimal damage, in part due to the intervention of the Japanese battleships of the Second Squadron.After the Japanese victory, Izumi and the rest of the Sixth Division were deployed to support the invasion of Sakhalin by escorting the army's transport ships.\nSoon after the conclusion of the war in September 1905, the aging Izumi was described by the Japan Weekly Mail as being \"obsolete\" and \"fit only for non-combat duties\". It was used instead for auxiliary tasks for several years. For example, the same newspaper reported in February 1906 that the ship would transport former Prime Minister of Japan and the first Japanese Resident-General of Korea It\u014d Hirobumi to his post. On 1 April 1912, Izumi was struck from Japan's navy list. It was later sold for scrapping in Yokosuka for \u00a590,975.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Acclaim was therefore originally intended as a short-term product until all-new products were ready for launch. On 26 December 1979, Michael Edwardes officially signed a collaboration between the two companies. The new car would be essentially be a licence-built version of the Honda Ballade (itself derived from the second generation Honda Civic), but with some modifications for the European market and locally sourced content. It replaced the Triumph Dolomite, which had finished production a year when the Canley plant in Coventry was closed down. The Acclaim was officially launched by BL on 7 October 1981. The Maxi had just been withdrawn from production at this stage, with Allegro production ending in March 1982.\nThe end of Dolomite and TR7 production meant that the Acclaim was the only car to wear the Triumph badge after 1981.\nThe Acclaim was a major turnaround point for BL itself, with the car achieving good reliability and build quality from the outset - a stark contrast to the quality-control issues which had plagued earlier models. The Acclaim held the record for the lowest percentage of warranty claims for a BL car. \nUnlike previous Triumphs, the Acclaim was assembled at the Pressed Steel Fisher Plant at Cowley, Oxford, taking over the withdrawn Austin Maxi production lines.

At that time the company was named P. Webley & Son. In 1897, Webley amalgamated with W & C Scott and Sons to become The Webley & Scott Revolver and Arms Company Ltd of Birmingham.\nWebley's revolvers became the official British sidearm in 1887, remaining in British service until 1964. After 1921, however, Webley service revolvers were manufactured by the government-owned Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield.\nIn 1932 the Enfield No.2 .38 inch calibre revolver, became the standard British service revolver. However, wartime shortages ensured that all marks of the Webley, including models in .455 and .38/200, remained in use through World War Two. The .455 Mk.VI was declared obsolete in 1945 but the .38 Mk.IV remained in service as a substitute standard weapon into the early 1960s.\nIn 1920, the passing of the Firearms Act in the UK, which limited the availability of handguns to civilians, caused their sales to plummet. The company adapted by producing pneumatic guns, their first being the Mark I air pistol.\nDemand for air guns increased rapidly in the 1920s and Webley's business began to grow again, with an inevitable peak related to weapons supply for British military use during the Second World War.  Declining sales led to the decision to give up firearms manufacture completely in 1979, however air gun production at the Birmingham factory continued until 22 December 2005, when the company closed down. Webley's dependent company - Venom Custom Shop - ceased trading as well. It was then bought by Wolverhampton-based company Airgunsport.

Sovereign held this distinction until 1990 when Norway succeeded her after being refurbished with the addition of two more decks. In 1991, Royal Caribbean International launched a slightly modified sister ship, Monarch of the Seas. In 1992, the line launched its third and final sister ship, Majesty of the Seas. These ships were among the largest modern cruise ships to sail during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nDuring that time, other major cruise lines also followed suit, building ships that included many of the same features and similar dimensions as the Sovereign class. Carnival Cruise Lines launched the Fantasy class in 1990, comparable in size to the Sovereign class and also featuring a multi-story atrium with glass elevators. Princess Cruises also countered by launching two ships in 1990 and 1991 to compete with the Sovereign class,  Crown Princess and Regal Princess.

{"id": "176_983", "question": "Which company is Opel Admiral produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "112_64330", "text": "From the late 1930s to the 1980s, terms from the German Navy (Kapit\u00e4n, Admiral, Kadett) and from other official sectors (Diplomat, Senator) were often used as model names. Since the late 1980s, the model names of Opel passenger cars end with an a. As Opels were no longer being sold in Great Britain, the need to have separate model names for essentially identical Vauxhall and Opel cars (although some exceptions were made to suit the British market) was made redundant. The last series to be renamed across the two companies was the Opel Kadett, being the only Opel to take the name of its Vauxhall counterpart, as Opel Astra. Although only two generations of Astra were built prior to the 1991 model, the new car was referred to across Europe as the Astra F, referring to its Kadett lineage. Until 1993, the Opel Corsa was known as the Vauxhall Nova in Great Britain, as Vauxhall had initially felt that Corsa sounded too much like \"coarse\", and would not catch on.\nExceptions to the nomenclature of ending names with an \"a\" include the under-licence built Monterey, the Speedster (also known as the Vauxhall VX220 in Great Britain), GT (which was not sold at all as a Vauxhall, despite the VX Lightning concept), the Signum, Karl, and the Adam. The Adam was initially supposed to be called, \"Junior\" as was its developmental codename and because the name 'Adam' had no history/importance to the Vauxhall marque.\nSimilar to the passenger cars, the model names of commercial vehicles end with an o (Combo, Vivaro, Movano), except the Corsavan and Astravan for obvious reasons.\nAnother unique aspect to Opel nomenclature is its use of the \"Caravan\" (originally styled as 'Car-A-Van') name to denote its station wagon body configuration, (similar to Volkswagen's Variant or Audi's Avant designations), a practice the company observed for many decades, which finally ceased with the 2008 Insignia and 2009 Astra, where the name \"Sports Tourer\" is now used for the estate/station wagon versions.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A fifth distillery, the Midleton distillery, joined the group soon after in 1868.In 1882, the company hired a young Corkman called Paddy Flaherty as a salesman. Flaherty travelled the pubs of Cork marketing the company's unwieldy named \"Cork Distilleries Company Old Irish Whiskey\". His sales techniques (which included free rounds of drinks for customers) were so good, that when publicans ran low on stock they would write to the distillery to reorder cases of \"Paddy Flaherty's whiskey\". In 1912, with his name having become synonymous with the whiskey, the distillery officially renamed the whiskey Paddy Irish Whiskey in his honour.In the 1920s and 1930s in Ireland, whiskey was sold in casks from the distillery to wholesalers, who would in turn sell it on to publicans. To prevent fluctuations in quality due to middlemen diluting their casks, Cork Distilleries Company decided to bottle their own whiskey known as Paddy, becoming one of the first to do so.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Its acronymous name was changed to upper- and lower-case Fiat in 1906. Agnelli led the company until his death in 1945, while Vittorio Valletta administered the firm's daily activities. Its first car, the 3 \u00bd CV, of which only 24 copies were built, all bodied by Alessio of Turin, strongly resembled contemporary Benz, and had a 697 cc (42.5 cu in) boxer twin engine. In 1903, Fiat produced its first truck. In 1908, the first Fiat was exported to the US. That same year, the first Fiat aircraft engine was produced. Also around the same time, Fiat taxis became popular in Europe.By 1910, Fiat was the largest automotive company in Italy \u2014 a position it has retained since. That same year, a new plant was built in Poughkeepsie, NY, by the newly founded American F.I.A.T. Automobile Company. Owning a Fiat at that time was a sign of distinction. The cost of a Fiat in the US was initially $4,000 and rose up to $6,400 in 1918, compared to $825 for a Ford Model T in 1908, and $525 in 1918, respectively. During World War I, Fiat had to devote all of its factories to supplying the Allies with aircraft, engines, machine guns, trucks, and ambulances. Upon the entry of the US into the war in 1917, the factory was shut down as US regulations became too burdensome. After the war, Fiat introduced its first tractor, the 702. By the early 1920s, Fiat had a market share in Italy of 80%.In 1921, workers seized Fiat's plants and hoisted the red flag of communism over them. Agnelli responded by quitting the company. However, the Italian Socialist Party and its ally organization, the Italian General Confederation of Labour, in an effort to effect a compromise with the centrist parties ordered the occupation ended. In 1922, Fiat began to build the famous Lingotto car factory\u2014then the largest in Europe\u2014which opened in 1923. It was the first Fiat factory to use assembly lines; by 1925, Fiat controlled 87% of the Italian car market. In 1928, with the 509, Fiat included insurance in the purchase price.Fiat made military machinery and vehicles during World War II for the Italian army and Regia Aeronautica and later for the Germans. Fiat made fighter aircraft like the biplane CR.42 Falco, which was one of the most common Italian aircraft, along with Savoia-Marchettis, as well as light tanks, obsolete compared to their German and Soviet counterparts, and armoured vehicles. The best Fiat aircraft was the G.55 fighter, which arrived too late and in too limited numbers to impact the outcome of the war.\nIn 1945, the National Liberation Committee removed the Agnelli family from leadership roles in Fiat because of its ties to Mussolini's government. These were not returned until 1963, when Giovanni's grandson, Gianni, took over as general manager until 1966 and as chairman until 1996.Fiat launched a nuclear research program in the 1950s.

About thirty of the Mark IX sports racing cars were made. It was closely related to the Lotus model Mark VIII (1954), of which only about seven cars were made. These cars were largely based on the innovative space frame of the Lotus Mark VI (1952).  The highly aerodynamic bodies were designed by Frank Costin and constructed by Williams & Pritchard Limited.\nDuring this early era, of 1954\u20131955, Lotus Engineering was still a fledgling company, and cars were delivered in different states of completion on special orders.  Similar to the Mark VIII, the Mark IX was available in various configurations and different engines, including the 1500 cc MG, 1500 cc Connaught and 2-litre Bristol were fitted. However, the Mark IX designation is most often powered by the 1100 cc Coventry Climax engine. Apparently, two models of Mark IX were offered \u2013 the \"Club\" and the \"Le Mans\", the latter of which had larger drum brakes fitted.\n\nThe chassis of the Mark IX was a new design, compared to that of the Mark VIII. Both were space frames of brazed steel tube. The new chassis was an advance over the Mark VIII in terms of the efficiency of its design and avoiding the VIII's need for diaphragm-stiffening panels. However, both chassis still used an oversized lower rail of 1.8-inch (5 cm) tube, a hang-over from the original design of the first Mark VI space frame. Compared to the Mark VIII, the Mark IX was shortened somewhat to a wheelbase of 7 feet 3.5 inches (2.22 m), and the body itself was about two feet (0.6 m) shorter than that of the Mark VIII. This was so that Colin Chapman could fit it on his transporter.A total of about thirty of the Mark IX sports racing cars were produced in various forms, and these were successfully raced in both Europe and the US. The first two examples of the Mark IX were apparently delivered to the US with the 1100 cc Coventry Climax engine to compete in the 1955 running of the 12 Hours of Sebring race and were beaten by a Porsche Spyder.  These cars were actually entered as Lotus Mark VIII models in the G class by Frank Miller of Larchmont, NY and by Bobby Burns and Norman J. Scott of Houston TX in, respectively, car numbers 78 and 79. The Lotus Works Team entered at least one Mark IX in the Le Mans 24 hour race in 1955, driven by Chapman, which may have been equipped with disc brakes. However, the car was disqualified apparently due to his reversing the car to re-enter the race track after going off course.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}
