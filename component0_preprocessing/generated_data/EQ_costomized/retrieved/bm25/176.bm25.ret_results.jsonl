In the 1920s, the product was modified into the menstrual pad Kotex. A further modification of the original crepe paper made it thinner and softer, and the resultant 1924 product was called \"Kleenex\" and marketed as a cold cream remover.   In line with the company's requirements for their brand names to be short, easy to say, and easy to explain, the name Kleenex was selected as the \"Kleen\" portion of the name denotes its cleansing purpose. The \"ex\" was added to show that Kleenex was of the family of products that included Kotex. This was the first marketing of a disposable paper-based facial tissue in the western world, and was sold as a substitute for face towels or cotton wool. In 1925, the first Kleenex tissue ad was used in magazines showing \"the new secret of keeping a pretty skin as used by famous movie stars\". A few years after the introduction of Kleenex, the Cellucotton's head researcher tried to persuade the head of advertising to try to market the tissue for colds and hay fever. The administrator declined the idea but then committed a small amount of ad space to mention of using Kleenex tissue as a handkerchief. By the 1930s, Kleenex was being marketed with the slogan \"Don't Carry a Cold in Your Pocket\" and its use as a disposable handkerchief replacement became predominant. In 1943, Kleenex began licensing the Little Lulu cartoon character to popularize the brand.", "hasanswer": false}]}

While it was possible to enable the extra features using a special software utility, it usually resulted in an unstable system, especially on earlier steppings of the chip when running 32-bit code.\nThere are also many rumours surrounding a 133 MHz, clock-quadrupled version of the Cyrix 5x86.

Some of the 100 and 120 MHz parts also contain support for the 4X multiplier setting, and some of these chips may also work at 133 MHz. However, the 5x86 is not known to overclock well; 120 MHz is generally considered to be pushing the limitations of the process on which it was fabricated.

This was particularly applicable to the Color Classic which is otherwise fixed at 512\u00d7384 resolution; the monitor scan rate remains the same, but horizontal pixel density (and total pixel clocks per scanline) is increased by 10% to fit the greater resolution in the same width.\nThe IIe card has 256K RAM; half is used to emulate the Apple IIe's standard 128K memory (reproducing its 64K main RAM plus the 64K bank-switched Extended 80-Column Text Card), and a small portition of the other half stores the IIe's ROM. Macworld reported that because Apple IIGS engineers helped design the IIe Card, all copy-protected and other software except for \"a few very esoteric games\" are compatible. The host Macintosh emulates or provides native access to many of the expansion cards and peripherals one might install in a bare Apple IIe. These services provided to the IIe card makes the simultaneous running of the host's System 7 impossible. Hardware services include a 1.44 MB 3.5\" SuperDrive, mouse, 1 MB RAM, 80-column text and graphical monochrome or color display, clock, numeric keypad, two hardware serial ports (in addition to the emulated serial port necessary for the IIe mouse), SCSI hard drive, and AppleShare file server. An included \"Y-cable\" enables the attachment of up to two external 140 KB floppy disk 5.25\" Drives, an 800 KB \"intelligent\" 3.5\" UniDisk drive, and an Apple II joystick or paddle control for use in Apple IIe emulation mode. 800 KB 3.5\" Drive and 1.44 MB SuperDrives are not supported nor function if attached directly via the Y-cable due to the Disk Controller on the IIe card lacking compatibility. (chip labeled U1A located in zone A1 of card \u2013 lower left as pictured above)\nThe product included the PDS card, Y-cable, owner's manual and two 3.5\" floppy disks: the 'Apple IIe installer disk' and the 'Apple IIe card startup disk'. Version 2.2.2d1 is the final revision of the startup disk. Version 2.2.1 and a patch to reach 2.2.2d1 was originally available at Apple Support Area (this software now archived and moved off site, as is the case with the original manual).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Known as the Super CCD, it was unique in having its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other SLR cameras. This allowed the use of a sophisticated interpolation system that, according to Fujifilm, produced an output image equivalent to 6.2 megapixels.

The command prompt was the less-than sign \"<\", and on receiving a single character command, it added this input character and the greater-than sign \">\". If the thermal printer was turned on, this would be output on a single line. The monitor included a number of service routines that could be accessed and used by a user's program to control I/O and code execution and was fully documented, including source code.\nThe machine featured dual cassette tape controls.  This made it possible to write large assembly programs using the two-pass assembler ROM. Source code in text was written twice consecutively to the input tape, and then the assembler, which could start/stop the input cassette tape using motor control, was invoked. During the first pass, the symbol table was built and stored in RAM. During the second pass, symbols would be translated and code written out on the second tape, also using start/stop motor control. Being able to avoid storing code in RAM made it possible to save a lot of space. It was, however, still important to keep the symbols list short since RAM size was often no more than 4 KB.\nIn 1981, Rockwell introduced an improved model with a 40-character display as the AIM-65/40.

Cadillac first used the name in 1916 to designate an enclosed 5-7 passenger sedan body style. In the thirties, the name was given to a formal body style with an open chauffeur compartment and enclosed rear quarters, metal roof and often \"razor-edged\" styling. When Cadillac started offering Fleetwood bodies on some of its cars in 1925, the Brougham body style was Fleetwood bodied every year with the exception of 1926.  After 1937, the Brougham name was not applied to any Cadillac for the remainder of the pre-World War II period.The Brougham name would eventually reappear on the 1955 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham show car which preceded the 4-door Eldorado Brougham hardtops of the 1957 to 1960 model years. The 1957 Cadillac Series 70 Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car, and so this would also mark the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name.\nAfter a five-year absence, the Brougham name reappeared as an option package on the 1965 Cadillac Sixty Special. The following year the Brougham moved up to becoming a subseries of the Fleetwood Sixty Special. This continued through 1970. Starting in 1971 the Sixty Special was only available as the well equipped Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham. When the Sixty Special Series was retired in 1977, the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham took its place as Cadillac's largest owner-driven sedan model through 1986.The single name \"Brougham\" began to be used as specific Cadillac model in 1987, when the term \"Fleetwood\" was dropped from the former Fleetwood Brougham.  It was otherwise the same as the 1986 model.  The reason for the change was that Cadillac had introduced a new front-wheel drive model in 1985 and named it simply the Fleetwood.  Compounding the confusion, the optional \"d'Elegance\" package (introduced in the upscale Fleetwood trim line in the 1970s, offering even more luxurious appointments, including button-tufted seating and rear-seat reading lamps), was available on and appended to the names of both models, resulting in a traditional body-on-frame/rear-wheel drive \"Fleetwood Brougham d' Elegance\" and a unibody/transverse engined \"Fleetwood d' Elegance\".  The solution was dropping the term \"Fleetwood\" from the rear-wheel drive model, leaving just the \"Brougham\". Since it was body-on-frame, it was popular among coachbuilders who manufactured stretched limousines, along with the similar but somewhat smaller Lincoln Town Car, as well as traditional Cadillac buyers who preferred the familiar combination of exterior size, heft, and rear-wheel drive. This was the last Cadillac to be produced without airbags.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The model line was introduced following the construction of a personal vehicle for Edsel Ford, who commissioned a coachbuilt 1939 Lincoln-Zephyr convertible, developed as a vacation vehicle to attract potential Lincoln buyers. In what would give the model line its name, the exterior was given European \"continental\" styling elements, including a rear-mounted spare tire.\nIn production for over 55 years across nine different decades, Lincoln has produced ten generations of the Continental. Within the Lincoln model line, the Continental has served several roles ranging from its flagship to its base-trim sedan. From 1961 to 1976, Lincoln sold the Continental as its exclusive model line.  The model line has also gone on hiatus three times. From 1949 to 1955, the nameplate was briefly retired. In 1981, the Continental was renamed the Lincoln Town Car to accommodate the 1982 seventh-generation Continental.  After 2002, the Continental was retired, largely replaced by the Lincoln MKS in 2009; in 2017, the tenth-generation Continental replaced the MKS.\nAs part of its entry into full-scale production, the first-generation Continental was the progenitor of an entirely new automotive segment, the personal luxury car. Following World War II, the segment evolved into coupes and convertibles larger than sports cars and grand touring cars with an emphasis on features, styling, and comfort over performance and handling. From 1956 to 1957, the Continental nameplate was the namesake of the short-lived Continental Division, marketing the 1956\u20131957 Continental Mark II as the worldwide flagship of Ford Motor Company; as a second successor, Ford introduced the Continental Mark series in 1969, produced over six generations to 1998.\nAlong with the creation of the personal luxury car segment, the Lincoln Continental marked the zenith of several designs in American automotive history. The Continental is the final American vehicle line with a factory-produced V12 engine (1948), the final four-door convertible (1967), and the final model line to undergo downsizing (for the 1980 model year).\nAmerican production of the Continental and MKZ, its only two sedans, ended in 2020 thereby making Lincoln a crossover/SUV-only brand in the USA.

As of 2024, it is the largest and heaviest combat aircraft, the fastest bomber in use and the largest and heaviest variable-sweep wing airplane ever flown. The Tu-160 is operated by the Long Range Aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces.Entering service in 1987, the Tu-160 was the last strategic bomber designed for the Soviet Air Forces and was built to serve as a conventional and nuclear-capable strike aircraft. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the newly independent Ukraine inherited a fleet of 19 Tu-160s, over half of all the Tu-160s in existence at that time. They had been deployed there since the late 1980s with local Soviet Air Force units and were soon afterwards handed over to the newly formed Ukrainian Air Force. Following protracted negotiations, 11 Ukrainian Tu-160s were purchased by the Russian Federation while the remainder were scrapped in the late 1990s under the Nunn\u2013Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction agreement.  Following these actions, the sole operator of the type is the Russian Aerospace Forces' Long Range Aviation branch, which has 16 Tu-160s in service as of 2016.

It was of wood and fabric construction, and of sesquiplane configuration, i.e. with its lower wing much smaller than its upper wing (both of which used the high-lift wing sections pioneered by the P.V.1). Unusually, the aircraft's wing bracing struts also carried the aircraft's floats, forming a \"W\" shape when viewed from the front.  The upper wing was attached directly to the top of the fuselage, giving a good field of fire for the intended armament of a single 2-lb Davis gun recoilless gun.The P.V.2 first flew on 16 June 1916, and demonstrated good performance and handling.  The upper wing, however, while giving excellent upwards view to the pilot, gave a poor downwards view of the pilot, particularly during landing, while the Davis gun had lost favour with the Admiralty as an anti-Zeppelin weapon.

The GSV-R replaced Suzuki's 500 cc two-stroke V4 RGV500 which was ridden by Kenny Roberts Jr. to win the 500cc World Championship in 2000.\nThe GSV-R was introduced on 2002, one year earlier than the original plan, with codename XRE0. New regulations were promoting the growth of four-stroke engines, and the performance of the new engine during testing was strong according to Suzuki. Despite the use of a new engine, XRE0 was using the old RGV500 Gamma Chassis, which was later criticized as a big mistake by many MotoGP analysts. Using the chassis and fairings that were previously made for the two-stroke RGV500 engine, XRE0 was hampered by many stability issues. The use of RGV500 Tyre spec was another mistake. Despite all of that, XRE0 was able to taste its first podium (2nd place) on the opening round at Suzuka and got third place at Rio in the same year. XRE0 achievements however were inconsistent, as the riders often fell down, crashed, or were forced to retire by technical failures. The top XRE0 rider by the end of The 2002 MotoGP Championship was Kenny Roberts Jr. in ninth place overall.\nFor 2007, MotoGP rules were changed to allow a maximum displacement of 800 cc. Suzuki introduced an 800 cc version of the GSV-R also known as GSV-R800.  The GSV-R800 was codenamed XRG0 because of its newly redesigned engine based on displacement limitations.  The new XRG0 engine was based from the layout of the 2006 990 cc GSV-R however, the XRG0 engines bore, stroke, and cylinder pitch had been redesigned to better suit the 800 cc engine displacement.  The factory Rizla Suzuki MotoGP team stated the new engines aim was to \u2018achieve the best possible horsepower and reliable high rpm operation, and to provide the riders with user friendly power delivery and predictable engine character.\u2019   The XRG0 was also equipped with a redesigned engine control unit supplied by Mitsubishi, capable of producing 220 horsepower at 17,500 rpm.  The chassis layout and wheelbase length from the 2006 GSV-R XRE4 used in the 2006 MotoGP season remained on the new model, however the fairing design had been updated to better accommodate high speed stability.The 2008 MotoGP season brought another redesigned GSV-R800 that Suzuki codenamed XRG1 as the successor to the XRG0 of the previous year.  This second generation 800 cc four-stroke prototype was the most complex and technically advanced racing motorcycle Suzuki had ever produced at its time.  The XRG1 had been developed closely with team riders Chris Vermeulen and Loris Capirossi and the feedback from the MotoGP team and Suzuki test engineers.  A key focus area in refining the XRG1 was improving acceleration.  This was accomplished by refining every detail of the 2007 XRG0 engine and an updated Mitsubishi ECU.  The resulted engine redesigning provided lower fuel consumption and increased usability.  Further refinements of the XRG0 chassis for the 2008 XRG1 allowed for better cornering performance and change of direction.  Along with the chassis refinements, a newly designed fairing  was developed to reduce wind resistance to enhance handling characteristics.At the end of 2011 Suzuki pulled out of MotoGP until at least 2014, citing the need to reduce costs amid the global economic downturn.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was designed to be compatible for all data formats. However the word size and instruction set were completely different; this presented significant difficulty as all programs had to be rewritten, so many customers switched to different vendors instead of upgrading existing UNIVACs.\nThe UNIVAC III weighed about 27,225 pounds (13.6 short tons; 12.3 t).The system was engineered to use as little core memory as possible, as it was a very expensive item. The memory system was 25 bits wide and could be configured with from 8,192 words to 32,768 words of memory. Memory was built in stacks of 29 planes of 4,096 cores: 25 for the data word, two for \"modulo-3 check\" bits, and two for spares.

For backward compatibility with the UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II data, two accumulators were needed to store a 12-digit decimal number and three accumulators were needed to store a 12-character alphanumeric value. When accumulators were combined in an instruction, the sign bit of the Most Significant Accumulator was used and the others ignored.\nThe CPU had 15 index registers, a four-bit field (x) allowed selection of one index register as the base register. Operand addresses were determined by adding the contents of the selected base register and the 10-bit displacement field (m). Instructions that modified or stored index registers used a four-bit field (xo) to select that index register.\nIndirect addressing or field selection was selected if the one-bit field (i/a) was set. Both indirect addressing and a base register could be selected in the indirect address in memory. Only a base register could be selected in the field selector in memory.\n\nSperry Rand began shipment in June 1962 and produced 96 UNIVAC III systems.\nThe operating systems(s) which were developed for the UNIVAC III's were called CHIEF, and BOSS.The assembly language was SALT.

Like the Leaf, the LE will also utilize a 24 kWh or larger lithium-ion battery pack mounted below the passenger compartment. Driving range on a single charge is estimated to be about 160 km (100 miles).  The LE is aerodynamically clean with its high rear deck, aero-treated wheels, rear diffuser, front spoiler and side spoilers to give a drag coefficient of Cd=0.25. The LE would mark the brand's first front-wheel drive car since the 2004 Infiniti I35 if the car goes into production.\nA key feature of the LE is its inductive wireless charging. The vehicle can be charged by parking it over a charge point located in the floor, rather than plugging into an electrical outlet.

{"id": "176_213", "question": "Which company is LINC-8 produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_56635", "text": "The LINC-8 contains one PDP-8 CPU and one LINC CPU, partially emulated by the PDP-8. At any one time, the computer is in either 'LINC mode' or 'PDP-8 mode' - both processors can not run in parallel. Instructions are provided to switch between modes. In the LINC-8, all interrupts are handled by the PDP-8 CPU, and programs that rely on the interrupt architecture of the LINC can not be run.\nThe LINC is a 12-bit ones' complement accumulator machine, whereas the PDP-8, while also a 12-bit accumulator machine, operates in two's complement arithmetic.\nMemory addressing on the two architectures is also different. On the LINC, the full address space is divided into 1024-word segments, two of which are selected for use at any one time: the instruction field and the data field. Direct access of data in the instruction field is possible using 10-bit addresses. The data field can only be indirectly addressed.  The Instruction field and Data field are theoretically capable of being chosen from up to 32 areas of 1K 12-bit words each as the maximum architecture is 32K total words.  As a practical matter, few LINC-8 systems ever were expanded to 8K total.  Memory expansion is accomplished first by adding PDP-8 memory extension hardware and extended memory instructions and a few minor LINC processor modifications to address the memory beyond the basic 4K total.  Once this is accomplished, 4K memory \"wings\" can be added in a daisy-chained buss arrangement, which in theory could be expanded out as many as seven times to implement the entire 32K.  As a practical matter, it is always difficult to implement on the \"regular\" PDP-8, and, in the case of the LINC-8, it becomes necessary to slow down the CPU slightly just to add on the first additional 4K.\nThus, as a practical matter, LINC-8 memory segments are limited to segment 0-3, or perhaps 0-7 on the few 8K implementations.  However, basic 4K machines cannot address beyond 0-3 while extended memory models can attempt to address segments 0-37 octal even if non-existent memory.\nBy convention, the segment 0 area is not available for normal fully emulated LINC operations.  This is because the PDP-8 program usually known as PROGOFOP is loaded there to handle all interrupts, traps, etc.  It is possible to write a program for a \"partial\" LINC CPU, meaning using only the hardware that actually exists.  Whenever an operation is performed that it cannot handle, the PDP-8 operation resumes.  However, the LINC operation could have been terminated for a variety of reasons.  As such, it is always recommended that PROGOFOP be loaded when attempting to use \"complete\" LINC programs on this system.\nMany operating systems were written for this machine; some were essentially slightly modified versions designed for the original LINC CPU it is partially based on.  Bootup conventions allow an image of a custom version of PROGOFOP to first be loaded, followed by executing tape instructions to load the LINC-based operating system.  In some cases, the bootup procedure is accomplished manually right on the LINC console switches; later systems self-start the system after loading PROGOFOP.\nOther operating systems are actually more generic and are designed to mostly ignore the LINC side of things.  These are PDP-8-only systems, although perhaps custom configured for the vagaries of the specifics of a LINC-8.  In some cases, this means that they cannot be run on any other machine; in other cases, the LINC-8 merely represented a normal variation of drivers off of an otherwise non-descript PDP-8 system.  An advantage of a PDP-8-based system is that PROGOFOP is superfluous here.  If needed, the PDP-8 system can load PROGOFOP as well as a user program primarily LINC-oriented to get at the laboratory peripherals.  The LINC convention of the entire first 1K being unavailable reserved for PROGOFOP is exchanged for the far smaller PDP-8 convention of reserving only 07600-07777 or the last 128-word page of the first 4K of the machine.  This corresponds to a small reserved area at the end of LINC segment 3 in exchange for much greater overall flexibility.\nThe PDP-8 divides its memory into 128-word pages. An instruction can reference the current page, that being the page where the instruction itself was located, or page 0, the 128 words of memory at addresses 0-127. Indirect addressing can be used to produce 12-bit addresses.  If more than 4K memory is implemented, the indirect addressing is extended to include the Data Field, thus it is possible to access any location indirectly in 32K maximum.  Again, hardware limitations of the LINC-8 make it hard to achieve a total size of more than 8K total.  Also implemented is the Instruction Field, making it possible to load larger programs into the same addressing space the Data Field controls.  Transfer of control can be either direct or indirect as required.  The new address is determined by first setting the new Instruction Field value, and then executing a JMP or JMS instruction into the new field's corresponding 12-bit address, thus effecting a 15-bit address overall.\nThe computer includes a number of LINC peripherals, which are controlled by special LINC mode instructions. These devices include analog inputs in the forms of knobs and jacks, relays for control of external equipment, LINCtape drives (the predecessor of the DECtape), an oscilloscope-like cathode ray tube under program control, as well as a Teletype Model 33 ASR.  Actually, the CRT is a specially modified unit based on a standard Tektronix oscilloscope modified to only be driven by D-A converters and an intensifier interface; there are no sweep circuits as found in conventional oscilloscopes.  Most of the modifications involve custom highly stripped down plug in modules, which also house the actual knobs hooked to the lowest A-D channels.  Arguably, this is the precursor to the modern mouse interface; some software utilized knob twirling in a manner that would later suggest the two-dimensional form of a mouse; these are knobs controlling only one parameter at a time, etc.\nSome of these peripherals are simulated and are actually peripherals of the PDP-8.  Any unimplemented operation stops the LINC CPU and interrupts the PDP-8 processor to handle the specifics.  Most notably, the LINCtape is actually a PDP-8 peripheral; the tape class of LINC instructions are trapped and interrupt the PDP-8 which then emulates how a real LINC or PDP-12 would carry out the specifics of the latest tape instruction.  Pressing a variety of keys on the seemingly present LINC console all cause PDP-8 interrupts; PROGOFOP is designed to emulate the functions as they would appear on the original LINC.\nAn interesting feature is the FETCH/EXEC stop, which is implemented in all hardware in the LINC and PDP-12.  The hardware, when enabled, continuously monitors instruction execution until specific conditions are met.  This will cause a PDP-8 interrupt stalling the LINC program.  Simulated console operations can be used to examine memory or make other changes, such as pressing the simulated DO key.  The DO key executes any one instruction on the left switch register while the right switch register may have to also be set in the case of double word instructions such as most of the tape class.  Booting certain operating systems consists of executing a tape read instruction directly from both sets of switches pressing the simulated DO key followed by pressing the simulated START 20 switch.  In essence, the LINC-8 implements all of the functions of the console panel of the \"real\" LINC, then uses the PDP-8 to simulate most of them.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The concept design was unveiled on 24 July 2006 at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh as the Cessna LSA (also referred to as the Cessna Sport), via a marketing study of the feasibility of producing an aircraft compliant with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's new Light-Sport Aircraft category.\nOn 13 October 2006, nine months after launching the program, the concept prototype aircraft, registered N158CS, first flew, departing McConnell Air Force Base for Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport and reaching a speed of 110 knots (200 km/h). Cessna formally launched the Skycatcher program 10 July 2007, following with a press event on 22 July 2007 at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh that unveiled a full-scale mockup and details about the planned production version.\nThe conforming prototype had its first flight on 8 March 2008, and the first initial production configuration aircraft flew on 5 May 2008.The company carried out testing of the aircraft beyond the ASTM Light Sport Aircraft requirements, including ground vibration testing and a full airframe fatigue test program on a production aircraft. In July 2009, Cessna announced that the 162 had completed flight testing to ASTM standards.On 9 August 2007, Cessna Aircraft announced that they had orders for 720 Skycatchers totaling US$75M. By 24 November 2007, Cessna had 850 firm orders and by the end of 2008 the company had confirmed over 1,000 orders. In July 2009, orders were still reported at \"over 1,000.\" Cessna vice president of propeller aircraft sales John Doman said sales activity had been slow because customers did not want to wait approximately four years for a delivery slot. In December 2009, the company delivered the first production Skycatcher to its initial customer, Cessna CEO Jack Pelton's wife, Rose Pelton. The company intended that the 2010 production rate would be 300 to 400 a year, but only 30 aircraft were delivered in 2010. By late 2013 \"droves\" of position holders had canceled their orders due to price increases and failure of the design to meet expectations.In October 2013, at the National Business Aviation Association convention, Cessna CEO Scott Ernest stated that the Cessna 162 had \"no future\". Cessna Vice President, Piston Aircraft, Jodi Noah, indicated that the aircraft had not met expectations.In February 2014, sales were halted. In December 2016, the remaining 80 unsold 162s were scrapped. These had been used to provide parts to keep the flying fleet going.In analyzing the imminent end of Skycatcher production, Paul Bertorelli of AVweb indicated that the reasons for ending production were high price, poor useful load and lackluster flight performance compared to its LSA market competitors.In a February 2017 review of the aircraft's history, AVweb writer Geoff Rapoport blamed the aircraft's failure on an empty weight that was too high, fragile construction and lack of cockpit space for taller pilots. He stated, \"the Skycatcher can\u2019t keep up because it wasn\u2019t really designed as an LSA. It\u2019s a scaled-down Cessna 152, which is a scaled-down Cessna 172, which is a scaled-down 747. I hope I\u2019m not bursting anyone\u2019s bubble by pointing out that Cessna is not exactly a modern innovator in design of light aircraft.\" He concluded, \"is this all the proof we need that LSAs make for bad airplanes?

{"id": "176_320", "question": "Which company is Isuzu Bellel produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_57014", "text": "The Isuzu Bellel is a compact car produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Isuzu from 1961 to 1967. It was the company's first independent design, and also Japan's first passenger car with a diesel engine. It was available as a four-door sedan and a five-door station wagon, called the Bellel Express. The Bellel Express was technically speaking a commercial vehicle, as was the custom in Japan at the time. The name \"Bellel\" resulted from combining the English word \"bell\" with the Roman numeral \"L\", equalling 50, and thus the name was supposed to represent \"fifty Bells\" (Isuzu literally means \"fifty bells\" in Japanese), and reflects a tradition within Isuzu of naming products that use terms that have special significance in Japan. Production began in time for the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo in October 1964, with initial release in select Japanese cities starting in April 1962.\n\nThe Bellel was fitted with 1.5 L and 2.0 L gasoline OHV engines with a Bosch licensed fuel injection system, and also the aforementioned 55 PS (40 kW) 2.0 L diesel (DL201) engine. The original diesel engine was called the DL200; it offered 52 PS (38 kW). All engines were mated with a four-speed manual transmission with the shifter mounted on the steering column. The suspension setup was modeled after the Hillman Minx, which was previously manufactured by Isuzu under a license agreement with the Rootes Group. The list of standard equipment expanded so that it could compete for sales against more popular products from more prolific Japanese  manufacturers, helping to justify the yearly road tax bill for using a large displacement engine, while remaining compliant with Japanese Government dimension regulations. As the private car ownership market in Japan began to grow, the Bellel was offered as an alternative to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric, and the Prince Gloria.\nThe original end treatment was updated in October 1965 in an attempt to afford the Bellel a more formal, upscale and mainstream look. The facelift included changes to the front fascia, where the previous single round headlights paired with smaller turn signals were replaced by quad round headlights arranged vertically.\n\nThe diesel engine - a first for a Japanese passenger car - made the Bellel popular for commercial applications, such as taxicab services. This partially helped to offset the Bellel's relative unpopularity with private customers, which resulted from the harshness of the early diesel engine and peculiar styling. A small number of these cars found their way into other countries, with the Bellel also offered with left-hand drive. 37,206 Bellels were manufactured in total (including the Express wagon/van), with production coming to an end in May 1967. Isuzu had a long history of manufacturing diesel engine products, and noticed in Europe that the Mercedes Benz and Peugeot intermediate class sedans also offered a diesel engine option and decided to offer one as well.", "hasanswer": true}]}

By the early 1990s, the company was in turmoil as their mini sales collapsed and their attempts to address this by entering the high-end market with machines like the VAX 9000 were market failures. After several attempts to enter the workstation and file server market, the DEC Alpha product line began to make successful inroads in the mid-1990s, but was too late to save the company.\nDEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry.

At a time when the luxury car market had been driven into freefall by a combination of government taxation policy and the depressed state of the postwar economy, the VLR was critical in keeping alive the company that produced it during the early 1950s.\n\u201cVLR\u201d stood for \u00ab V\u00e9hicule l\u00e9ger de reconnaissance \u00bb (light reconnaissance vehicle).   The name \u00ab VLRD \u00bb V\u00e9hicule l\u00e9ger de reconnaissance Delahaye\u00bb is also sometimes used.\nThe vehicle featured a light metal ohc four-cylinder water-cooled engine of (initially) 1,995 cc and, by the standards of the time, a sophisticated suspension system.   The four-speed gear box featured synchromesh on all four speeds.During the second half of 1950 the French army tested it extensively and declared themselves impressed.   With only very minor modifications, they homologated the VLR for army use and placed an order for slightly more than 4,000.   The company's postwar production model, the Delahaye 175 had fared disastrously in the marketplace, with just 521 produced between 1947 and 1950, so the military order secured for the VLR was more than welcome.\nThe army were impressed by the performance of the vehicle both on and off-road, and the company was encouraged to try to sell VLRs into the civilian market.   Civilian-market models were hard to distinguish from the military ones, but the 24-volt electrical system upon which  the military had insisted was replaced, in the civilian VLRs, by a more conventional (for the time and vehicle's size) 12-volt electrical system.   The VLR's civil-market price of above one and a half million francs was considered expensive (though much lower than the prices asked for the company's luxury passenger cars), and its mechanical complexity made it an unattractive proposition other than for rich owner-mechanics.   It is worth bearing in mind that in the aftermath of a massive European war there were at this time a large number of second-hand Jeeps competing for the attention of anyone thinking to buy a civilian version of a VRC. Almost all of the 9,621 VLRs sold between 1951 and 1955 were accordingly sold to the military.   Production was halted in March 1954, but vehicles were still being delivered in 1955.It was said that the mechanical complexity of the vehicle, which excited much comment in the press and was blamed for its lack of sales success on the civilian market, was not seen as a problem by the army.   Nevertheless, by the mid-1950s the army had switched to the mechanically simpler Jeep, then being assembled in France by Hotchkiss under Willys license as the Hotchkiss M201. The Delahaye business itself was taken over by Hotchkiss in 1954, after which VLR production seems to have been quickly stopped.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Its ISO film speed equivalents range from 100 - 1600.  The S2 Pro also has sound recording capability. The camera is no longer in production, having been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro in February 2004.\nAside from the Nikon lens mount, the camera's principal distinction is its 6.17 megapixel photo sensor. Known as the Super CCD, it is unique in having its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other DSLR cameras. This allows the use of a sophisticated interpolation system that produces an output image equivalent to 12.1 megapixels. The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lies somewhere between 6.17 megapixels and the 12.1 megapixel interpolated output.\nA huge number of these cameras were built using a Sony sourced defective CCD that was subject to a recall by Fuji.

The Master System launched in North America in 1986, followed by Europe in 1987, and then in Brazil and Korea in 1989. A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987, which features a few enhancements over the export models (and by proxy the original Mark III): a built-in FM audio chip, a rapid-fire switch, and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses. The Master System II, a cheaper model, was released in 1990 in North America, Australasia and Europe.\nThe original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards. Accessories include a light gun and 3D glasses that work with specially designed games. The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot, turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system, and is incompatible with the 3D glasses.\nThe Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Its library is smaller and with fewer well-reviewed games than the NES, due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity. Though the Master System had newer, improved hardware, it failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. However, it attained significantly greater success in other markets, including Europe, Brazil, South Korea and Australia.\nThe Sega Master System is estimated to have sold between 10 and 13 million units worldwide. In addition, Tectoy has sold 8 million licensed Master System variants in Brazil.

The initial 15 mm variant then became known as the MG 151/15, with the new 20 mm variant becoming the MG 151/20.\nThe MG 151/20 cannon was widely used on German Luftwaffe combat aircraft throughout World War II, mainly as offensive armament, but also seeing some use as defensive guns. Existing MG 151/15 guns saw use as aircraft armament throughout the war, albeit more limited compared to the MG 151/20, but also as anti-aircraft guns in various configurations, such as the SdKfz 251/21 Drilling half-track which carried three MG 151/15.\nPost-war, salvaged MG 151/20 saw usage by many nations. France had salvaged many guns and became the main user and exporter of the MG 151/20 during the Cold War, fitting it to not only aircraft, but also armoured fighting vehicles as anti aircraft weaponry.

The chief designer was Arkhip M. Lyulka, and after his death, Victor M. Chepkin. As the AL-31 was not yet ready for the first two T-10 prototypes in 1977, they were initially powered by modified AL-21F3 turbojet engines. The third prototype would be the first to install the AL-31. The T-10 design would be heavily revised into the T-10S, with T-10-7 being the first prototype of the improved design; the aircraft's aerodynamic refinements from changes in the outer shaping and packaging also resulted in the AL-31 gearbox changing to a top-mounted position. State tests of the AL-31 were completed in 1985, and the T-10 entering Soviet air services as the Su-27. The engine is manufactured at Ufa-based UMPO and Moscow-based Salyut.After the collapse of the Soviet Union, design bureau and production plant distinctions realigned and gradually faded, and Lyulka-Saturn eventually merged with Rybinsk Motors to become NPO Saturn and was closely aligned with UMPO while Salyut became an independent entity; both Saturn and Salyut would make their own developments for the AL-31 family. Salyut also supplies AL-31 variants to fighters operated by the China. The J-10 uses the AL-31FN before newer variants transitioned to the domestic WS-10A, while the J-20 uses the AL-31FM2 as an interim engine until its intended WS-15 is ready. This reorganization would result in serious disputes between Saturn and Salyut over intellectual property rights and royalties over AL-31 sales to China.The AL-31 was also used to assist Chinese engine designer and manufacturer Shenyang/Liming in developing the WS-10, with early examples directly using the AL-31F control system. According to Saturn's Victor M.

The M15 of the future will be different than the car shown in 2006.\nDespite increased comfort and usability compared to previous Noble cars press releases stated that Noble expected the M15 to be significantly quicker than the M400 around a race track. It is able to accelerate from 0\u201360 mph (0\u201397 km/h) in 3.3 seconds and has a top speed of 185 mph (298 km/h).The car was based on a brand new platform with a longitudinally mounted engine connected to a bespoke gearbox created by Graziano. The double wishbone suspension is a development of the system mounted on the M400. Mounting the engine longitudinally allowed the designer to increase cooling flow to the engine which allows the 3.0L twin turbo V6 to produce 455 bhp (339 kW; 461 PS).

Designed to carry between 66 and 124 passengers, it was larger than any prior aircraft built by the company. The project's existence was revealed in early 1997 and was formally introduced at the Paris Air Show two years later. On 19 February 2002, the first prototype E-Jet conducted its maiden flight; later that year, quantity production of the type commenced. In early March 2004, the first E170 deliveries were made to LOT Polish Airlines. Larger versions of the aircraft, the E190 and E195, debuted later in 2004, while a slightly stretched version of the E170 was introduced in mid-2005 as the E175.\nThe E-Jet series has been a commercial success primarily due to its ability to efficiently serve lower-demand routes while offering many of the same amenities and features of larger jets. Initial teething issues were quickly overcome and Embraer rapidly expanded product support for better global coverage. The E-Jet family is commonly used by both mainline and regional airlines around the world and has become particularly popular with regional airlines in the United States. It has also served as the basis for the Embraer Lineage 1000 business jet. During the 2010s, Embraer developed a second generation, the E-Jet E2 family, with more fuel-efficient engines. However, as of 2023, the first generation E175 remains in production, to fulfill demand from regional airlines in the United States, which cannot use the newer generation due to scope clause restrictions.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The Warlock confronts a fake psychic, tricking her into allowing herself to be possessed by Satan who tells him to reassemble The Grand Grimoire, a book separated into three pieces which can unmake Creation. Ripping out the psychic's eyes and using them as a compass, the Warlock finds the first piece of the Grand Grimoire hidden inside an antique table at Kassandra's flat.\nWhile there, he places an ageing curse upon her and takes her bracelet. Redferne arrives with a \"witch compass\" to track the Warlock. After Redferne explains some basic rules of Witches and Warlocks, such as their weakness to purified salt, Kassandra follows him in order to regain her bracelet, which will allow her to become young again.

As the first home computer architecture with coprocessors, it has graphics and sound more advanced than most of its contemporaries. Video games are a key part of the system's software library, and the 1980 first-person space combat simulator Star Raiders is considered the platform's killer app. The \"Atari 8-bit family\" label was not contemporaneous. Atari, Inc., used the term \"Atari 800 [or 400] home computer system\", often combining the model names into \"Atari 400/800\" or \"Atari home computers\".The Atari 800 was packaged as a high-end model, and the 400 was more affordable. The 400 has a pressure-sensitive, spillproof membrane keyboard and initially shipped with 8 KB of RAM. The 800 has a conventional keyboard and a second cartridge slot, and allows easy RAM upgrades to 48K. Both use identical technology: the MOS Technology 6502 CPU at 1.79 MHz (1.77 MHz for PAL versions) and the same custom coprocessor chips. The plug-and-play peripherals use the Atari SIO serial bus, and one of the SIO developers eventually went on to co-patent USB (Universal Serial Bus). The core architecture of the Atari 8-bit family was reused in the 1982 Atari 5200 game console, but games for the two systems are incompatible.\nThe 400 and 800 were replaced by multiple computers with the same technology and different presentation. The three models of the XL series were released in 1983: the 1200XL, 600XL, and 800XL. After the company was sold and reestablished, Atari Corporation released the XE series in 1985: the 65XE, also sold as the 800XE, and 130XE. The XL and XE are lighter in construction, have two joystick ports instead of four, and Atari BASIC is built-in. The 130XE has 128 KB of bank-switched RAM. In 1987, Atari Corporation repackaged the 65XE as a console, with an optional keyboard, as the Atari XEGS. It is backward compatible with computer software.\nTwo million Atari 8-bit computers were sold during its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985. In 1984, Atari reported 4 million owners of its computers and its 5200 game console combined. The 8-bit family was sold both in computer stores and department stores such as Sears using an in-store demo to attract customers. The primary global competition came when the similarly equipped Commodore 64 was introduced in 1982. In 1992, Atari Corporation officially dropped all remaining support for the 8-bit line.", "hasanswer": true}]}

While the Cressida was an upper-level mid-size rear-wheel drive car with a straight-six engine, the Avalon is front-wheel drive, powered by a V6 engine. In recent years, there has been considerable overlapping with its platform mates, the Camry V6 and the Lexus ES, although the third-generation and subsequent Avalon was distinguished by offering extra legroom due to its extended-length chassis. From 2013, the Lexus ES was moved to the extended platform to match the Avalon.As of 2013, the Avalon is sold in the United States, Canada, China, South Korea and the Middle East. It was discontinued in the United States in 2022.Avalon is a legendary island featured in the Arthurian legend, fitting it in with Toyota's tradition of naming their sedans the word for \"crown\" in various languages (Crown, Corona, Camry, Corolla), types of crowns (Tiara), or other things associated with royalty (Scepter).", "hasanswer": true}]}

HMS Formidable's 826 and 829 Squadrons were the first to operate the Albacore from an aircraft carrier, operations commencing in November 1940. The Albacore suffered from reliability problems with the Taurus engine, although these were later solved, so that the failure rate was no worse than the Pegasus equipped Swordfish. The Albacore remained less popular than the Swordfish, as it was less manoeuvrable, while the controls were considered to be too heavy for a pilot to perform much evasive action after dropping a torpedo.Eventually, there were 15 first-line FAA squadrons equipped with the Albacore which operated widely in the Mediterranean. In March 1941, Albacores made torpedo attacks during the Battle of Cape Matapan, inflicting severe damage on the Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto despite the presence of heavy anti-aircraft fire. The type also played a prominent role in the ill-fated raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo during July 1941. Albacores also participated, with greater success, in the fighting at El Alamein, dropping flares to mark targets for RAF night bombers.Between September 1941 and June 1943, No. 828 Squadron, based at RAF Hal Far, Malta, operated a squadron of Albacores under severe blitz conditions during the Siege of Malta. The type employed a mixture of mines and bombs to attack Italian shipping, including convoys, along with shore targets in Sicily, mainland Italy, and North Africa. Albacores also supported the landings at Sicily and Salerno, guarding against enemy submarines and raiding key enemy facilities such as airfields and forts.\nOn 9 March 1942, twelve Albacores from HMS Victorious attacked the German battleship Tirpitz at sea near Narvik. Based on information from one of a search force of six Albacores that had been launched earlier, Albacores from 817 and 832 Squadrons launched torpedoes. One attack came within 20 yd (18 m) of Tirpitz, but the attack failed for the loss of two aircraft.During 1943, the Albacore was replaced in FAA service by the newer Barracuda. The final Albacore squadron of the FAA, No. 841 Squadron, which had flown numerous shore-based attacks against shipping in the English Channel for the whole of its career with the Albacore, was disbanded in late 1943.The Royal Air Force deployed some Albacores; 36 Squadron based at Singapore acquired five to supplement its Vickers Vildebeests at RAF Seletar in December 1941. The remnants of the squadron was captured by the Japanese in March 1942. During 1943, No. 415 Squadron RCAF was equipped with Albacores (presumably ex-FAA) before the Flight operating them was transferred and reformed as 119 Squadron at RAF Manston in July 1944. The squadron deployed later to Belgium and their Albacores were disposed of in early 1945, due to spares shortages, in favour of the inferior but ASV radar-equipped Swordfish Mk.IIIs that the squadron kept until the end of the war on 8 May. This was to combat German mini-submarines attacking Allied shipping entering the River Scheldt on its way to the Port of Antwerp. The Aden Communication Flight used 17 Albacores between the middle of 1944 and August 1946. Some of these were delivered by sea on the SS Empire Arun in December 1945 (all from Royal Navy stock).\nThe Royal Canadian Air Force took over the Albacores and used them during the Normandy invasion, for a similar role until July 1944.

The commercial failure of the Virtual Boy was reportedly a contributing factor to Yokoi's withdrawal from Nintendo, although he had already planned to retire years prior and then finished the successful Game Boy Pocket, which was released shortly before his departure. According to his Nintendo and Koto colleague Yoshihiro Taki, Yokoi had originally decided to retire at age 50 to do as he pleased but had simply delayed it. Nintendo held that Yokoi's departure was \"absolutely coincidental\" to the market performance of any Nintendo hardware. The New York Times maintained that Yokoi kept a close relationship with Nintendo. After leaving Nintendo, Yokoi founded his own company, Koto, and collaborated with Bandai to create the WonderSwan, a handheld system competing with the Game Boy.\nThe commercial failure of the Virtual Boy reportedly did little to alter Nintendo's development approach and focus on innovation. The console's focus on peripherals and haptic technology reemerged in later years. The original inventor, Reflection Technology, Inc., was reportedly financially \"devastated\" by the Virtual Boy's performance, with dwindling operations by 1997.The Nintendo 3DS console was launched in 2011, as a handheld gaming console with autostereoscopic 3D visuals, without any special glasses. Prior to launch, Shigeru Miyamoto discussed the Virtual Boy. He said it renders wireframe graphics, but its effects are generally used for two-dimensional games with depth-separated planes. He stated that the graphics are not as appealing, and while developing the Nintendo 64, he had ruled out the use of wireframe graphics as too sparse to draw player characters. Finally, he stated that he perceived the Virtual Boy as a novelty that should not have used the Nintendo license so prominently.In February 2016, Tatsumi Kimishima stated that Nintendo was \"looking into\" virtual reality but also explained that it would take more time and effort for them to assess the technology, and in a February 2017 interview with Nikkei, he stated that the company was \"studying\" VR, and would add it to the Nintendo Switch once it is figured out how users can play for long durations without any issues. Nintendo introduced a VR accessory for the Switch as part of Labo, a line of player-assembled cardboard toys leveraging the console's hardware and Joy-Con controllers. In this case, the console is used as a head-mounted display for the headset.\nHobbyists adapted Virtual Boy to other displays. Emulation enabled modern stereoscopic goggles such as Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR and Oculus Rift in 2016. In 2018, hobbyist Furrtek released a board that replaces the display circuitry, allowing the Virtual Boy to be played on a VGA monitor or television set. On February 25, 2024, a homebrew Virtual Boy emulator for the Nintendo 3DS was released, named \"Red Viper\", which made it possible to play the Virtual Boy library using stereoscopic 3D.Nintendo has referenced the Virtual Boy in other games, such as Tomodachi Life\u2014where a trailer for the life simulation game included a scene of several Mii characters worshipping the Virtual Boy. In Luigi's Mansion 3, Luigi uses a device by Professor E. Gadd known as the \"Virtual Boo\" to access maps and other information in-game (succeeding the use of devices referencing the Game Boy Color and first-generation Nintendo DS in previous installments). Its menus use a red and black color scheme, while E. Gadd optimistically boasts that the device would \"fly off the shelves\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The factory had no access by road, therefore components were delivered by rail and finished cars were shipped out the same way.\nThe British cars had right-hand drive with the door hinged from the right hand side of the car and the steering column moved across to the right as well. Right-hand drive meant that both the driver and the engine were on the same side, so a 27 kg (60 lb) counterweight was added to the left side to compensate.

Girling brake components replaced the ATE brake parts.\nThe Isetta was not popular in the UK until a three-wheeled version was introduced.

Fender emblems showed \"Datsun 1200\" and \"60 HP\" (\"55ps\" for models sold in Japan) with a \"Datsun\" emblem on the front nose of the hood.\n\nAvailable body styles include a single cab \"truck\" (320), a long wheelbase single cab truck (G320), a double cab \"pickup\" with flush sides (U320), and a three-door \"van\" (V320). Though described (and taxed) as a van in the Japanese market, the V320 is essentially a two-door station wagon. The 320 came in two cab and bed versions: Regular, and as the N320 \"Sports Pick-Up\" (1963\u201365) variation which is a rarer (around 1,000 produced) version with the cab and bed of a one-piece design. Its back half is greatly different than that of the standard, separate bed 320 pick-up; it uses much of the rear sheet metal and the taillights from the V320 Light Van.\n\nBed and luggage space were in addition to the expansion, with the support of the market characteristics and the robust chassis engine was easy to handle, it was a best seller in the truck market segment.\nThe chassis was also a sales hit 310 in the reinforcement of the type Datsun Bluebird 310, a variation of the same series, in which the X-members plus a reinforcement of the Fairlady roadster of the S310-type CSP311. It was also used for the new Silvia coup\u00e9.\nIn 1964 the 320 underwent minor changes. After having adding the failed Light Stout, Toyota took over Hino's Briska and then continued with the Hilux. Mazda also competed in this segment, with the Mazda B-Series. In 1960, Nissan assumed operations of the Minsei Diesel Industries, Ltd., renaming the company as Nissan Diesel Motor Co., Ltd (now UD Trucks).", "hasanswer": false}]}

The V2 rocket also became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line (edge of space) with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944.Research of military use of long-range rockets began when the graduate studies of Wernher von Braun were noticed by the Wehrmacht Heer. A series of prototypes culminated in the A4, which went to war as the V2. Beginning in September 1944, more than 3,000 V2s were launched by the Wehrmacht against Allied targets, first London and later Antwerp and Li\u00e8ge. According to a 2011 BBC documentary, the attacks from V-2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel, while a further 12,000 laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons.The rockets travelled at supersonic speeds, impacted without audible warning, and proved unstoppable, as no effective defense existed.

It debuted at the World Expo 2005, held  in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The vehicle is a cross between a microcar, a motorcycle, and a vehicular exoskeleton. The goal of Toyota is to provide a personal mobility, which can be used on roads but also does not hinder interaction with pedestrians. For this the i-unit has two possible setups. First, there is an upright low speed setup, where the rider has a higher position and can have conversations face-to-face with pedestrians and can move among people. This upright position can be transformed while driving to a low position, where the rider sits much lower and more reclined. This high speed setup has a much lower center of gravity and is for driving at higher speeds.\nThe i-unit weighs 180 kilograms (400 lb). It contains a lithium ion battery and features Intelligent Transport System technology.  The rear wheels are powered by electric motors, and the device is steered with the front wheels. In the upright position it has a turning radius of 0.9 metres (35.4 in), which means it can turn on the spot. The vehicle is controlled by two joystick-like devices at the front of the armrests, and uses a Drive-by-wire technology. An Intelligent Transport System (ITS) technology aims to reduce the likelihood of accidents.\nThe color of the lights can change according to the preferences or emotions of the operator. The shape was designed to symbolize a leaf, and the design incorporates environmentally friendly materials such as kenaf.\nThis concept vehicle is used by Toyota for public relations, and they state that The \"i-unit\" is a form of \"personal mobility\" that seeks to attain a greater balance of meeting individuals' wishes to enjoy freedom of movement, harmony with society, and harmony with the Earth's natural environment. They also refer to these vehicles as wearable personal mobility vehicles. A representative at the IAA 2005 in Frankfurt stated that Toyota may plan to offer these type of vehicles for sale, but did not provide a date when the vehicle will be available. Currently the vehicle lacks features such as a storage compartment (i.e. Trunk or glove compartment), and the protection against bad weather is inadequate.\nTwelve i-units together with two Toyota i-foots (two legged walking seats for one passenger, maximum capacity 60 kg) performed at the Toyota Pavilion at the 2005 World Expo in Aichi.\n\nThe i-unit has been superseded by the i-swing, a three-wheeler that leans in curves.

Kriegsmarine) before and during World War I. The class was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's efforts to competitively evaluate three foreign submarine designs.\nThe design of the boats was based upon the Electric Boat Company's EB-17 (C-class), the first to be designed by the company's new chief designer, Lawrence York Spear. It featured a single, teardrop hull, which resembled the design of modern nuclear submarines. The class members were just over 105 feet (32 m) long and displaced 240 tonnes (240 long tons) surfaced and 273 tonnes (269 long tons) submerged. All were originally equipped with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes. The first two boats, U-5 and U-6, built specifically for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, to the same design as the United States C-class submarine were partially constructed in the United States and completed at Whitehead & Co. at Fiume. The third was completely constructed by Whitehead's at Fiume and purchased by Austria-Hungary to bolster their U-boat fleet after the outbreak of World War I.\nAll three boats had successes during World War I; between them they sank five ships with a combined tonnage of 22,391. In addition they captured seven ships as prizes and damaged Jean Bart, a French dreadnought of 22,189 tons displacement. All three boats were sunk during the war, though U-5, the lead boat of the class, was raised and recommissioned after her sinking.

{"id": "176_607", "question": "Which company is Porsche 959 produced by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_58074", "text": "Development of the 959 (originally called the Gruppe B) started in 1981, shortly after the company's then-new Managing Director, Peter Schutz, took his office. Porsche's chief engineer at the time, Helmuth Bott, approached Schutz with some ideas about the Porsche 911, or more aptly, a new one. Bott knew that the company needed a sports car that they could continue to rely on for years to come and that could be developed as time went on. Curious as to how much they could do with the rear-engined 911, Bott convinced Schutz that development tests should take place, and even proposed researching a new all wheel drive system. Schutz agreed, and gave the project the green light. Bott also knew through experience that a racing program usually helped to accelerate the development of new models. Seeing Group B rallying as the perfect arena to test the new development mule and its all wheel drive system, Bott again went to Schutz and got the approval to develop a car, based on his development mule, for competition in Group B.\n\nThe powerplant is a sequential twin-turbocharged DOHC flat-six engine equipped with 4 valves per cylinder, fuel fed by Bosch Motronic 2.1 fuel injection with air-cooled cylinders and water-cooled heads, with a bore x stroke of 95 mm \u00d7 67 mm (3.74 in \u00d7 2.64 in) for a total displacement of 2,849 cc (173.9 cu in). It was coupled to a unique manual transmission offering six forward speeds with the first gear labelled \"gel\u00e4nde\" (terrain), allowing the car to pass noise regulations, as well as reverse. The engine was largely based on the 4-camshaft 24-valve powerplant used in the Porsche 956 and 962 race cars. These components allowed Porsche to extract 450 PS (331 kW; 444 hp) at 6,500 rpm and 500 N\u22c5m (369 lb\u22c5ft) of torque at 5,000 rpm from the compact and efficient power unit. The use of sequential twin turbochargers rather than the more usual identical turbochargers for each of the two cylinder banks allowed for smooth delivery of power across the engine speed band, in contrast to the abrupt on-off power characteristic that distinguished Porsche's other turbocharged engines of the period. The engine was used virtually unchanged in the 959 road car as well.\nTo create a rugged, lightweight shell, Porsche adopted an aluminium and Aramid (Kevlar) composite for the body panels and chassis construction along with a Nomex floor, instead of the steel floor normally used on their production cars.\nPorsche also developed the car's aerodynamics, which were designed to increase stability, as was the automatic ride-height adjustment that became available on the road car (961 race cars had a fixed suspension system). Its drag coefficient was as low as 0.31 and aerodynamic lift was eliminated.The 959 also featured Porsche-Steuer Kupplung (PSK) all-wheel-drive system. Capable of dynamically changing the torque distribution between the rear and front wheels in both normal and slip conditions, the PSK system gave the 959 the adaptability it needed both as a race car and as a \"super\" street car. Under hard acceleration, PSK could send as much as 80% of the available power to the rear wheels, helping make the most of the rear-traction bias that occurs at such times. It could also vary the power bias depending on road surface and grip changes, helping maintain traction at all times. The dashboard featured gauges displaying the amount of rear differential slip as well as transmitted power to the front axle. The magnesium alloy wheels were unique, being hollow inside to form a sealed chamber contiguous with the tyre and equipped with a built-in tyre pressure monitoring system.The 959 was actually produced at Karosserie Baur, not at the Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen, on an assembly line with Porsche inspectors overseeing the finished bodies. Most of Porsche's special order interior leather work was also done by the workers at Baur.\nThe 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show was chosen for the unveiling of the Porsche Group B prototype. Even in the closing hours of October 9, finishing touches were being applied to the car to go on display the next morning. After the first two prototypes, the bodywork was modified to include air vents in the front and rear wheel housings, as well as intake holes behind the doors. The first prototype receiving those modifications was code named \"F3\", and was destroyed in the first crash test.The road version of the 959 debuted at the 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show as a 1986 model, but numerous issues delayed production by more than a year. The car was manufactured in two levels of trim, \"Komfort\" and \"Sport\", corresponding to the trim with more creature comforts and a more track focused trim. First customer deliveries of the 959 street variant began in 1987, and the car debuted at a cost of DM431,550 (US$225,000) each, still less than half what it cost Porsche to build each car. Production ended in 1988 with 292 cars completed. In total, 337 cars were built, including 37 prototypes and pre-production models. At least one 959 and one 961 remain in the Porsche historic hall in Stuttgart, Germany.\nIn 1992/1993, Porsche built eight more cars assembled from spare parts from the inventory at the manufacturing site in Zuffenhausen. All eight were \"Komfort\" versions: four in red and four in silver. These cars were much more expensive (DM 747,500) than the earlier ones. The later cars also featured a newly developed speed-sensitive damper system. The cars were sold to selected collectors after being driven by works personnel for some time and are today by far the most sought-after 959 models.\nIf desired, even more power was available to customer cars by Porsche. According to Paul Fr\u00e8re there was an optional 530 PS (390 kW; 523 hp) factory upgrade, with an increased top speed of 336 km/h (209 mph) along with the 0\u2013100 km/h (0\u201360 mph) acceleration time reduced to 3.4 seconds.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This was the first, and till now (2012) the only Peugeot to feature a V4 engine.   A maximum 9 hp of power was delivered to the rear wheels.\nThe car was the first of several Lion-Peugeot models that became known as a Lion-Peugeot 10 hp.   This was a reference to the car's fiscal horse power, applying a system of car classification for taxation purposes then being established in France.   Tax horsepower then, and for several decades to come, was defined purely as a function of the combined surface area of the engine's cylinders, this being far easier to assess consistently and accurately than the actual power produced by an engine.   At this stage fiscal horse-power tended to equate approximately to actual horse-power, although the two would diverge subsequently, as engines became more efficient at extracting power from a given sum of cylinder diameters.  Eventually, in the second half of the twentieth century, more complex (and less internationally consistent) definitions of fiscal horse power would replace those defined only by cylinder diameters.\nThe V4C3 shared its 2,250 mm wheel base with the manufacturer's models from the previous year such as their twin-cylinder Type V2C3.   The 3,200 mm (approximately) body length provided space for between two and four people depending on the body specified.

The design, internally designated R 1001, had a barrel-like fuselage, giving it a destinctive rotund appearance, from which its name is derived. A relatively thin swept wing configuration was adopted after wartime aerodynamic research from Germany indicated its favourable high speed qualities. It was powered by the recently-developed de Havilland Ghost turbojet engine. The Swedish Air Force placed an initial order for three prototypes under the service designation J 29 during Autumn 1946. On 1 September 1948, the first prototype performed its maiden flight; flight testing proved the aircraft to exceed performance estimates in several aspects.\nDuring May 1951, Br\u00e5valla Wing (F 13) received the first production aircraft.

However, several officials felt that the single-cabbed arrangement used by the majority of Type 1s presented drivers with visibility difficulties in the 'less convenient' direction. BR therefore approached several manufacturers to seek a new locomotive that had a centre cab and low bonnets to maximise visibility. Clayton were selected to produce their proposed locomotive as the Class 17. Its low engine covers required the use of a pair of Paxman 6ZHXL six-cylinder horizontal engines, which had been intended for powering railcars; it was a somewhat unorthodox arrangement for the era.\nProduction of the Class 17 was undertaken between 1962 and 1965, with the locomotives being assigned to the north of Britain and the Scottish Region. Early on it was determined that the locomotive was not suited to heavy freight trains, and they quickly acquired a reputation for unreliability largely due to the engines, which continued to deliver poor performance even after extensive modifications. The Class 17 proved to be one of the least successful of the Type 1s, such that by 1967, long lines of unserviceable locomotives could be found stored in less accessible sidings at various locations across the Central Belt of Scotland (e.g. Ardrossan and Millerhill). Withdrawals took place from July 1968 to December 1971, meaning some members of the class had a working life of less than 5 years.

One hypothesis is that the announcement of the transition in Selmer's 1974 literature was premature. Another is that Selmer produced both the Mark VI design and early Mark VII horns concurrently, or possibly until the existing parts for the Mark VI were used up. Reported early Mark VII examples have Mark VII keywork on Mark VI type body tubes.\nThe Mark VI Soprano, Baritone, and  Bass models were produced from 1954-1981.

Their Triumph-badged 'in-house' competitor failed to achieve anything like the sales figures of the BMC small FWD cars, though the BMC 1100 range featured several badge-engineered variants.  Moreover, the front wheel drive configuration failed to realise the handling and road-holding advantages that Triumph had hoped for, and the tall profile limited other uses for the FWD drive train, such as in the Spitfire. The 1300 was well-made and sold reasonably well in the small luxury sector, but after its direct successor was quietly switched to rear wheel drive in 1973, Triumph never designed another FWD car. More significantly, from 1970 the 1300 was re-engineered as a rear-wheel drive car and went on to form the core of Triumph's compact range as the 1300 cc Triumph Toledo (launched in 1971) and the larger engined Triumph Dolomite released in 1972.  Like all Standard-Triumph offerings, DIY servicing was simple: the oil filter could be replaced without jacking the car, the clutch plate could be replaced from inside the car.  This simplicity is what made this vehicle stand out from other British made front wheel drive cars. The N/S engine configuration allowed a lot of working space around the engine. The starter was repositioned to the front of the engine and although was a two-minute job to replace, it made the car extremely noisy during startup.  It takes its place in history as being the only production car made in Britain to begin life as a front-wheel drive, and end it as a rear-wheel drive until Leyland's successor, MG Rover, repeated the trick in turning the Rover 75 into the MG ZT 260. The Achilles heel of the 1300 was, primarily the poorly designed suspension wishbone layout and the front stabilizers. Unfortunately, some jobs are very involved. Changing the brake discs, CV joints or front wheel bearings all involve substantial work and should be renewed together if required. engine was too heavy for this particular design and owners found it very frustrating as the rubber bushes had to be changed every few months.  Triumph's alternative engineering design answer to the E/W Mini configuration, was a catastrophic failure. The 1300 was also assembled in Israel by the local partner of Standard-Triumph International, Autocars Co. of Tirat Carmel. However, due to the Israeli government's policy regarding car assembly, Triumph was forced to introduce this vehicle in a 1493 cc version in early 1968, two years ahead of this engine's introduction in the UK. In fact, it was not until another Israeli assembler, Illin Industries, had shut down operations before Triumph could assemble the 1300 in Israel. One curious design offshoot of the 1300 was the \"Pony\" jeep-like farm vehicle, later renamed \"Dragoon\". The Pony was exclusively offered for Autocars within the joint venture contract, but very few units were actually produced in Israel, as of 1968. The same 4WD-design was used in a rally version of the Triumph 1300. The rally project enjoyed some success before the vehicle crashed and rolled in 1969. The 4WD Triumph 1300 was subsequently abandoned.\nAlthough the FWD 1300 was something of a disappointment, the basic design went on to provide Triumph with a popular small car until the end of Dolomite production in 1980 and overall, delivered an outstanding return on their original investment.\nThe Triumph 1300 has a following today in the UK classic car movement, though some parts are now scarce and the number of surviving cars not especially high.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Her keel was laid down in 1887 and she was launched on 23 August 1888. After completing fitting-out work, the new cruiser was completed on 8 September 1889 and delivered to the Regia Marina. In 1890, Piemonte participated in the annual fleet maneuvers in the First Squadron, along with the ironclad Lepanto, Dogali, and several torpedo boats. The exercises were conducted in the Tyrrhenian Sea, where the First Squadron was tasked with defending against an attacking \"hostile\" squadron. By 1891, the Italian Navy had determined that Piemonte's armament was too heavy, and so the four broadside 6-inch guns were replaced with lighter 4.7-inch guns and their sponsons removed. In addition, the heavy military masts were replaced by light pole masts. In the following years, the ship served in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean in addition to the Mediterranean. In mid-1896, violence against Italians in Brazil prompted the Italian government to dispatch Piemonte on a mission to secure the interests of Italian nationals in the country. The attempt at gunboat diplomacy secured an official apology from the Brazilian government, as well as an arrangement to adjudicate Italian claims of damages by the United States' and German ambassadors.In late 1901, Piemonte was assigned to the East Asian station after a year-long modernization. She passed through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea and stopped to coal in British Aden while en route to Asian waters. In September 1902 she was in Nagasaki, Japan, with the Italian cruiser Lombardia. Piemonte met the British cruiser HMS Talbot in the British colony at Weihaiwei. A party of officers and men from Piemonte visited the British ship on 28 July. That year, she was joined by the armored cruiser Vettor Pisani and the protected cruiser Elba. The following year, the armored cruiser Marco Polo and the protected cruiser Puglia were scheduled to replace Vettor Pisani and Piemonte, respectively, but due to the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War on 8 February 1904, Piemonte remained in the region. On 24 February, Piemonte arrived in Seoul and landed a contingent of infantry to augment the guards at the Italian embassy. Piemonte was finally recalled to Italy in April; she stopped in Singapore on 22 April to coal, departing two days later for home.By 1908, Piemonte had been assigned as the flagship of the torpedo flotilla of the main fleet, which consisted of seventeen destroyers and fifty first and second class torpedo boats. In August that year, Piemonte participated in the annual summer maneuvers of the Italian fleet. She was assigned to a squadron and was tasked with defending against an opponent fleet that attempted to force an amphibious landing. The maneuvers were modeled on a potential war with Italy's nominal ally Austria-Hungary, and the fact that the relative strengths of the two squadrons mirrored the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies was not lost on analysts in Vienna. The maneuvers concluded with a fleet review on 18 October. Piemonte then spent 1909 deployed again to the Far East.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The 1,600 hp (1,200 kW) FA-2/FB-2 (along with the FPA-2/FPB-2 variants) was built between October 1950 and June 1956. Finally, the 1,800 hp (1,300 kW) FPA-4/FPB-4, powered by the 251 V-12 engine, was built between October 1958 and May 1959 by ALCO's Canadian subsidiary, Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW).The FAs, as well as their cousins, the ALCO PAs, were born as a result of ALCO's development of a new diesel engine design, the Model 244.  In early 1944, development started on the new design, and by November 1945, the first engines were beginning to undergo tests.  This unusually short testing sequence was brought about by the decision of ALCO's senior management that the engine and an associated line of road locomotives had to be introduced no later than the end of 1946.\nIn preparation for this deadline, by January 1946, the first four locomotives with the 244 engines had been built. Two FA-1s and an FB-1 were painted in ALCO Demonstrator colors and were released for road tests for a month and a half on the Delaware and Hudson Railway.\nA strike at ALCO delayed production beyond the first four units and the three demonstrator units began working on the Gulf, Mobile, and Ohio Railroad in mid February 1946. The demonstrators were returned to Schenectady when the remainder of the order began delivery in May 1946.\nThe GM&O order was completed in April 1947 for a total of 80 units. Before the end of this production run, ALCO upgraded the generators and traction motors in the locomotives, with the first of these models entering service in February 1947 for the New York Central.\nIn 1950, the Montreal Locomotive Works, an affiliate of ALCO, began production of FAs as well. In the fall of 1950, an upgraded model, the FA-2, was launched. This model featured an uprated Model 244 engine, with an output of 1,600 horsepower. Additionally, the carbody was lengthened, making possible the addition of a steam generator in the A unit to allow for use in passenger service.  Models equipped as such were designated the FPA-2/FPB-2.The first FA-2s were delivered in October 1950 to the Baltimore and Ohio and the Erie.  By this time, however, the cab unit had fallen out of favor due to the greater versatility of road switchers, and US production of the FA line ended in 1956, with Canadian production ending in 1959.From the 1970s until 1999, the Long Island Rail Road used 20 FA units converted into \"power packs\". The traction motors were removed, and original prime movers replaced with 600 horsepower (450 kW) engines/generators solely for supplying Head-end power (HEP). The engineer's control stand was left intact, allowing the engines to be used in push-pull service with other locomotives, which usually lacked HEP.

The Lotus 30 was raced in British races such as Guards Trophy, international races such as Nassau Speed Week that allowed FIA Group 4 \"Sports Car\" class of racing machines, and more importantly, in Can Am series.  These were before the recognition and creation of Group 5, 6 and 7 categories by FIA in 1966.  This explains why Lotus 30 and 40 (the latter was built in 1965) came originally equipped with headlights, tail lights and a windscreen wiper.\nNotable for its curvilinear fibreglass body work and \"pickle fork\" backbone chassis first seen in the front engine Lotus Elan, On the 30 the layout was reversed and placed the engine behind the driver.  Lotus engineer Len Terry was asked by Chapman to comment on the draft concept and considered it to be so flawed he refused to have anything to do with it.  The Lotus 30 was powered by a 4.7 litre (289 c.i.) Ford V8 engine, the same type as used in the Ford GT40, mated to a 5 speed ZF synchromesh 5DS20 transaxle which was far more reliable than the Colotti transaxle used in the 19B against the torque of the V8.  It used 13 inch wheels and solid disc brakes on each wheel.  The Lotus 30 was regarded as unsuccessful and / or dangerous but when everything was working and nothing broke, the car was incredibly fast.\n\nThe inherent flaws of the engineering became evident as horse power requirements and tire technology of the period evolved and pushed the original design past its intended limits. The problems were mainly related to the torsional rigidity of the backbone chassis and materials available at the time, all of which resulted in chassis and suspension failures. \nJim Clark laboured long with the car, and managed to prise some promising results with it before it was replaced with the Lotus 40. Equipped with 15in wheels and vented disc brakes as well as a larger engine, the 40 was just as recalcitrant as the 30. The most telling comment about these Lotus race cars was made by the American driver Richie Ginther. When asked what he thought of the new Lotus 40, Ginther, a lugubrious Californian, said, \"Same as the 30 but with ten more mistakes\".\nThe effort was not a total loss as this chassis type proved to be perfectly acceptable for the lower powered Lotus Europa, and was used on the Esprit series cars with further development.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The innovation introduced with Old Forester was not that it was available in such bottles, but that it was the first bourbon to be exclusively available in this fashion \u2013 providing a greater level of assurance of quality for that brand relative to other products in the market. This innovation was enabled and further fueled by emerging advances in the mass production of glass bottles, such as those soon to be developed by Michael Owens. The sealed bottle approach was popular with doctors and with the pharmacists that sold the product, and their approval was touted in advertisements of the product to the general public.Originally, the product name was spelled \"Old Forrester\", with a double \"r\". The product is reported to have been named after a physician Dr. William Forrester who endorsed its consumption, and the renaming is conjectured to have been a way to avoid direct reference to the physician's name. Originally formed by George Garvin Brown and his half-brother John Thompson Street Brown (J.T.S. Brown, who would also later figure into the history of the Four Roses Distillery and inspire the naming of a brand of bourbon produced by Heaven Hill Distilleries), the company that produces the product was originally registered as J. T. S. Brown & Bro., and became Brown\u2013Forman in 1902 after several partnerships and name changes involving partners James Thompson (who was also involved in the Glenmore Distillery Company and created the Old Thompson brand), Henry Chambers, and George Forman. George Garvin Brown became sole owner by 1902, and although Brown\u2013Forman is now a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, the Brown family still controls more than 70% of the voting shares (as of 2010).To produce his Old Forester product, Brown would initially purchase whiskies from distillers such as John McDougal Atherton and Ben Mattingly, and blend them together. In 1902, he then purchased Mattingly's distillery in the town of Saint Mary in Marion County, Kentucky.Until Prohibition in the United States began in 1920, Old Forester was the leading brand produced by Brown's company. The company was granted one of the few government licenses to produce medical whiskey, at which time the product became a straight bourbon at 100 proof (previously it had been a blended product).Since then, other brands were acquired by the company, such as Early Times (purchased in 1923, which became America's best-selling bourbon and maintained high sales for 30 years), and Jack Daniel's (purchased in 1956 and as of 2007 the best-selling whiskey of any kind in the world), have become its leading products.Every year since 2002, Old Forester releases a Birthday Bourbon expression, made available exclusively through a national sweepstakes. The winners are chosen on September 2, to commemorate the day of Brown's birth.In August 2016, Old Forester announced the release of its 115-proof \"1920 Prohibition Style Bourbon\".

The car was fitted with a 6.0-litre V12 engine, utilising Volkswagen Group's long-established Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) turbodiesel technology. This engine produces 368 kW (500 PS; 493 bhp) at 4,000 rpm and 1,000 N\u22c5m (738 lbf\u22c5ft) of torque at 1,750-3,000 rpm.

The Silvia was sold at Nissan Prince Store, and the 180SX was sold at Nissan Bluebird Store locations. In Japan, the 180SX replaced the Gazelle. The S13 Silvia was discontinued in 1993, but the 180SX successfully convinced Nissan to keep it in the market for the full length of the next generation Silvia (S14). The 180SX differed from the S13 Silvia in that it featured pop-up headlights and a liftgate with different body work at the rear of the vehicle. Specifications and equipment were similar; however, the naturally aspirated CA18DE engine was not offered.The name 180SX was originally in reference to the 1.8 liter displacement CA18DET engine used in the chassis. In 1991, however, the engine was upgraded to a 2.0 liter model, offered in two forms: the turbocharged SR20DET variant and the naturally aspirated SR20DE engine, which was introduced in 1996. Although the new engine was of larger displacement, the 180SX nomenclature remained.\n180SX was also a trim level of the S110 Silvia in Europe. The badges for this model read \"Silvia 180SX\", so this car is not properly a 180SX by model, but a version of the Silvia instead.\nOther discrepancies from this standard were distributed to Micronesia and South Pacific islands, including LHD cars with 180SX badges and non-retractable headlamps.Like the Japanese 180SX SR20DET discrepancy, European, as well as South African models of the S13 chassis were called 200SX though equipped with the CA18DET engine.\nIn North America, It was sold as the Nissan 240SX Fastback with the KA24DE engine and various other trim differences.\nIn Europe the car was sold as the 200SX in spite of featuring the 1.8-liter CA18DET engine, producing 169 PS (124 kW; 167 hp). This allowed the 200SX to reach 100 km/h (62 mph) in 7.5 seconds and onto 220 km/h. The car had a facelift in 1991 with new smoother bumpers, limited slip differential, and larger brakes. This 200SX was sold between 1989 and 1994 until the change to the succeeding S14 version.\nJapanese tuning company Kid's Heart produced 500 official units of a 180SX and Silvia hybrid known as the Sileighty. These cars were built upon the standard 1998 180SX platform but had the headlamps, front wings, hood, front bumper and fixings from a Nissan Silvia swapped over. These cars were available with the naturally aspirated or the turbo engine, with the same 140 or 205 PS (103 or 151 kW) as a standard S13. A five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic were available. Kid's Heart also offered some mechanical and tuning upgrades, including revised suspension, an improved limited-slip differential and an ECU tune from Nismo.

It replaced the Bristol 401 and 402 in 1953 and continued in production for two years.\nIt retained much the same styling as the 401, but featured many mechanical improvements compared to that model. The 1971 cc six-cylinder engine was modified through the use of bigger valves and larger main bearings with a diameter of 54 mm as against 51 mm on the 400 and 401, which increased the power output to 100 hp (75 kW) as against 85 hp (63 kW) on the 401. The acceleration was markedly improved: the 403 could reach 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) in 13.4 seconds as against 16.4 seconds for the 401. The 403 had top speed of 104 miles per hour (167 km/h).To cope with this increased power, an anti-roll bar was fitted on the front suspension and improved drum brakes known as \"Alfins\" (Aluminum finned) were fitted. Early models had them on all wheels, but Bristol thought the car was over-braked and they were thus restricted to the front wheels on later 403s.\nThe 403 was the last Bristol to feature a BMW-style radiator grille.

The bottom of the carriages is dark grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the carriages is painted grey. Red colouring at the end of each car forms red parallelograms when the carriages are combined.

It was rumored that all recalled P-series machines were destroyed, however a handful of them are known to exist in private collections. At least one model, the P500, was commercially released in Europe but only sold in small numbers.\nThe most common of the B-series was the low-profile B128 (called the CBM 610 in Europe), which had 128 kilobytes of RAM. The B128 did not sell well, and ultimately Commodore's inventory was liquidated by Protecto Enterprizes, a large Commodore mail order dealer based in Chicago, Illinois. The Protecto ads for the B128 bundle, including a dual disk drive, monitor and printer, appeared in various computer magazines for several years.\nThe CBM-II line sold poorly and ended up being extremely expensive to manufacture, as well as difficult to develop software for. Commodore did not release any sales figures or an official discontinuation date, however the B128/600 is the most common model in the lineup. Production ended at some point during 1984 and Commodore liquidated their remaining inventory in 1985. CBM-IIs were still being sold in Germany up to 1987. The exact number of CBM-IIs produced is unclear, however serial numbers indicate that at least 10,000 B128s were shipped along with a few dozen to a few thousand of the other models. It is believed that Commodore produced at least 5000\u20136000 of each machine.\nAfter discontinuing the CBM-II range, Commodore handed its documentation, schematics, and all other information over to CBUG, the Chicago B128 Users Group.\nAmong these materials was a prototype motherboard using an Intel 8088 processor, which hints at the possibility the line could have been made IBM compatible if production had continued.CBUG went on to develop a library of software for the computers. Its library, however, paled in comparison to the large software libraries enjoyed by the Commodore 64 and VIC-20.\nThe rounded case design of the high-profile CBM-II series would later be used in redesigned versions of the original PET/CBM computers, (such as the CBM8296) that the CBM-II line was designed to replace.

In addition to widespread unserviceability and maintenance problems, the Tu-22's handling characteristics proved to be dangerous. Its landing speed was 100 km/h (60 mph) greater than previous bombers and it had a tendency to pitch up and strike its tail upon landing. It was difficult to fly, and had poor all-round visibility. In 1962, Tupolev commenced work on major update of the Tu-22. Initially, the bureau planned to add a variable-sweep wing and uprated engines into the updated design. The design was tested at TsAGI's wind tunnels at Zhukovsky.During this time Sukhoi developed the T-4, a four-engine titanium aircraft with canards. A response to the XB-70, it was to have a cruise speed of 3,200 km/h (2,000 mph), requiring a major research effort in order to develop the requisite technologies. Tupolev, whose expertise was with bombers, offered the Soviet Air Force (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, VVS) a massively updated version of the Tu-22.Compared to the T-4, it was an evolutionary design, and thus its appeal lay in its simplicity and low cost. The Soviet government was skeptical about the need to approve the development of a replacement aircraft so soon after the Tu-22 had entered service. The Air Force and Tupolev, in order to save face regarding the Tu-22's operational deficiencies and to stave off criticisms from the ICBM lobby, agreed to pass off the design as an update of the Tu-22 in their discussions with the government. The aircraft was designated Tu-22M, given the OKB code \"Aircraft 45\", and an internal designation of \"AM\". Their effort was successful as the government approved the design on 28 November 1967, and decreed the development of the aircraft's main weapon, the Kh-22 missile. The T-4 itself made its first flight in 1972, but was later cancelled.US intelligence had been aware of the existence of the aircraft since 1969, and the first satellite photograph of the bomber was taken in 1970. The existence of the aircraft was a shock to US intelligence as Nikita Khrushchev, who had been the Soviet premier up to 1964, was adamant that ICBMs would render the bomber obsolete.As in the case of its contemporaries, the MiG-23 and Su-17 projects, the advantages of variable-sweep wing (or \"swing wing\") seemed attractive, allowing a combination of short take-off performance, efficient cruising, and good high-speed, low-level flight. The result was a new swing-wing aircraft named Samolyot 145 (Aeroplane 145), derived from the Tupolev Tu-22, with some features borrowed from the abandoned Tu-98 project. The Tu-22M was based on the Tu-22's weapon system and used its Kh-22 missile. The Tu-22M designation was used to help get approval for the bomber within the Soviet military and government system.The Tu-22M designation was used by the Soviet Union during the SALT II arms control negotiations, creating the impression that it was a modification of the Tu-22. Some suggested that the designation was deliberately deceptive, and intended to hide the Tu-22M's performance. Other sources suggest the \"deception\" was internal to make it easier to get budgets approved. According to some sources, the Backfire-B/C production variants were believed to be designated Tu-26 by Russia, although this is disputed by many others. The US State and Defense Departments have used the Tu-22M designation for the Backfire.Production of all Tu-22M variants totalled 497, including pre-production aircraft.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The G.91 was specifically designed to fulfil the requirements of this competition, being relatively lightweight and capable of operating from austere airstrips while also being armoured and suitably armed while remaining relatively affordable in comparison to many frontline fighters. On 9 August 1956, the prototype conducted its maiden flight. After reviewing multiple submissions, the G.91 was picked as the winning design of the NBMR-1 competition.\nDuring 1961, the G.91 entered into operational service with the Italian Air Force, and with the West German Luftwaffe in the following year. Various other nations adopted it, such as the Portuguese Air Force, who made extensive use of the type during the Portuguese Colonial War in Angola and Mozambique.

First customer delivery, as of March 2009, was originally planned to take approximately 18 months and occur in 2011.On July 1, 2010, it was announced that the Terrafugia Transition had been granted an exemption from the FAA concerning its Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW), allowing the Transition to be certified with a take-off weight up to 1,430 pounds (650 kg); the limit matches the MTOW for amphibious light-sport aircraft. The extra 110 pounds (50 kg) granted by the exemption provides more weight allowance for the mandatory road safety features such as airbags and bumpers.\nThe proposed design of the production version was made by Danish designer Jens Martin Skibsted and his partners at KiBiSi and made public at AirVenture Oshkosh on July 26, 2010.  Aerodynamic changes revealed included a new, optimized airfoil, Hoerner wingtips, and removal of the canard after it was found to have an adverse aerodynamic interaction with the front wheel suspension struts; furthermore, the multipurpose passenger vehicle classification from the NHTSA removed the requirement for a full width bumper that had inspired the original canard design.On November 16, 2010, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published Terrafugia's petition for a temporary, three-year hardship exemption from four FMVSS standards in the Transition. Terrafugia requested to use lighter weight motorcycle tires instead of RV tires, polycarbonate for the windshield and side windows, basic airbags instead of advanced, dual stage airbags and to not include an electronic stability control system. \nThe NHTSA granted all of the requested exemptions on June 29, 2011, but limited the stability control and airbag exemptions to one year.In June 2011, a delay was announced and Terrafugia's CEO estimated that about another 18 months would be required before first customer delivery in \"late 2012\", but this was not achieved. December 2011 saw the base price increase to US$279,000 from an initial price of US$194,000.After undergoing drive tests and high-speed taxi tests, the production prototype completed its first flight on March 23, 2012, at the same airport in Plattsburgh, New York, that was used for the Proof of Concept's flight testing. The production prototype then made its auto show debut at the 2012 New York International Auto Show in April 2012.In June 2012, Terrafugia announced that the Transition had completed the first of six phases of flight testing.  By July, the second phase of testing was underway, expanding the performance envelope in the sky and continuing drive testing on the ground.In January 2013, development continued and the company announced that it might be necessary to construct a third, completely new prototype, due to the large number of modifications required. The modifications to date are said to appear to have improved the previous handling characteristics.By March 2014, the design of the third, updated prototype had progressed to finalization of the major structural members and a statement to investors said that it would be used in final compliance testing for certification before the first customer delivery which was then estimated to take at least another 18 months and occur \"in 2015\".By April 2014, 12 two-person test flights had taken place; this was the first time that anyone other than Terrafugia's chief test pilot had flown the Transition.  As of 22 August 2014, first customer delivery was hoped for in about 18 months \"in the second quarter of 2016.\"In December 2014 the company asked the FAA to allow the Transition to be operated at a gross weight of 1,800 lb (816 kg) instead of the light-sport aircraft maximum weight of 1,320 lb (599 kg) and have a stall speed of 54 kn (100 km/h; 62 mph) instead of the category maximum of 45 kn (83 km/h; 52 mph). The company indicated that the increases were required to allow inclusion of structures to meet FMVSS ground operation safety regulations. The company had previously been granted an increase in gross weight of 110 lb (50 kg) and another LSA aircraft, the ICON A5, was granted a 250 lb (113 kg) exemption to meet FAA spin resistance requirements; this new application would increase the Transition's allowed weight by a total of 480 lb (218 kg) or 36%. During consultations the request for the weight increase was supported by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the Experimental Aircraft Association, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and the Light Aircraft Manufacturers Association. Only a few individuals expressed opposition to the request. The exemption was granted by the FAA on 19 June 2016.In April 2015 the company announced that parts were being built for the third version of the aircraft, and that current planning estimated the first customer delivery after roughly two years.  Terrafugia COO/VP of Engineering Kevin Colburn also stated that the company has changed the price estimate from $279K to between $300K and $400K.In November 2015, the company announced that the third version of the Transition was being tested with a Rotax 912is engine, rather than the Rotax 912ULS that the second prototype had flown with.As of April 2017, the company's website says: \"Today, Terrafugia is finalizing production vehicle design and compliance testing in preparation for vehicle deliveries within the next three years.\"As of November 2017, media reports suggested a 2019 delivery date for the first vehicles.In April 2018, the production prototype (\"D2\") was retired. While the original proof of concept vehicle had flown only about 8 hours in total, the production prototype had logged 212 flight hours, completing 317 takeoffs and landings.In July 2018 the company announced a series of upgrades that will be incorporated in the production aircraft with delivery planned for July 2019. These include a hybrid-electric motor and lithium iron phosphate battery for road mode use, a Dynon electronic flight instrument system, a Ballistic Recovery Systems ballistic parachute, an inflight power boost feature, a remodeled interior, increased cargo space, improved seat belt design, airbags, plus three rearview cameras.In January 2021, Terrafugia announced that the Transition received a Special Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA) airworthiness certificate from the FAA for the Transition to be flown only, with road use approval to follow in 2022.In February 2021, it was reported that Terrafugia had laid off most of their employees and would close down operations in the United States later in the year, with the intention of moving to China.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Built between 1917 and 1934, it was the first non-Great Western Railway (GWR) type to use and improve upon the basic design principles established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward. The N class was based on the GWR 4300 Class design, improved with Midland Railway concepts.The N class was mechanically similar to the SECR K class 2-6-4 passenger tank engine, also by Maunsell. It influenced future 2-6-0 development in Britain and provided the basis for the 3 cylinder N1 class of 1922. Production was delayed by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and the first N class rolled out of Ashford Works in 1917, three years after design work was completed. The class replaced obsolete 0-6-0s as part of the SECR's fleet standardisation, as they used parts interchangeable with those of other classes.\nEighty N class locomotives were built in three batches between the First and Second World Wars. Fifty were assembled from kits of parts made at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, giving rise to the nickname of \"Woolworths\".

When introduced, its 76.2 mm (3 in) tank gun was more powerful than its contemporaries, and its 60-degree sloped armour provided good protection against anti-tank weapons. The T-34 had a profound effect on the conflict on the Eastern Front, and had a long-lasting impact on tank design. The tank was praised by multiple German generals when encountered during Operation Barbarossa, although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war. Its main strength was its cost and production time, meaning that German panzer forces would often fight against Soviet tank forces several times their size. The T-34 is also a critical part of the mechanized divisions that form the backbone of the Deep Battle Strategy.\nThe T-34 was the mainstay of the Soviet Red Army armoured forces throughout the war. Its general specifications remained nearly unchanged until early 1944, when it received a firepower upgrade with the introduction of the greatly improved T-34-85 variant. Its production method was continuously refined and rationalized to meet the needs of the Eastern Front, making the T-34 quicker and cheaper to produce. The Soviets ultimately built over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded despite the loss of tens of thousands in combat against the German Wehrmacht.Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most-produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/T-55 series). With 44,900 lost during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses ever. Its development led directly to the T-44, then the T-54 and T-55 series of tanks, which in turn evolved into the later T-62, that form the armoured core of many modern armies.

The R suffix denotes a racing version, however the CB1100R was a road-legal machine produced by Honda and offered for sale to the public. It was produced only in numbers sufficient to meet the homologation requirements for the R to be classed as a production motorcycle in markets into which it was sold. It was Honda's first 'homologation special' and was raced in the production class racing in most major markets: including Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. It was not sold in the US.\nIn 1980, the first batch of 110 naked versions were rushed to Australia specifically with the aim of winning the world renowned Castrol 6 Hour race.   The Honda did indeed win with future world champion Wayne Gardner and Australian champion Andrew Johnson riding.  The organisers of the event then prevented the single seat Honda from entering the 1981 Castrol 6 Hour as they deemed it a \"race special\".  In 1981, the CB1100R won the New Zealand Castrol Six Hour ridden by Australian pair of Malcolm Campbell and Mick Cole.  The CB1100R was slightly modified to have a dual seat so as to reclassify it as a road bike, so allowing it to enter the 1982 Castrol 6 Hour, and duly won this premier Australian production race in 1982, the Castrol Six Hour in the hands of future 1987 500cc GP World Champion Wayne Gardner and teammate Wayne Clark. Other CB1100Rs finished the race 2nd, 3rd and 4th, with 6 CB11000Rs finishing in the top 8 spots. The Australasian success of the CB1100R lead directly to the development of the Suzuki GSX1100SXZ Katana homologation racing specials.\nThe model designations are CB1100RB (1980 and 1981), CB1100RC (1982), and CB1100RD (1983). In 1980/81, 1050 units were sold, followed by 1500 per year in 1982 and 1983. The 1981 'RB' was half faired with a solo seat only. The 82 and 83 models have different bodywork including a full fairing, aluminium fuel tank, and pillion seat covered with a removable seat cowl.

None of the fairing parts of any of the 3 models are interchangeable with one another. The RC fairing, fairing bracket and dashboard combo was only made for the RC and  does not interchange in any way with the RD, which had a slightly shorter overall length. Other differences include the paint scheme, rear swing arm design and color and front fork design. In 1983 the Honda CB1100F was launched that essentially was a blend of the CB1100R and the CB900F, for a broader market.

The new car would be essentially be a licence-built version of the Honda Ballade (itself derived from the second generation Honda Civic), but with some modifications for the European market and locally sourced content.

It was taken over in 1834 by his son-in-law, Philip Webley, who began producing percussion sporting guns.  The manufacture of revolvers, for which the firm became famous, began twenty years later.  At that time the company was named P. Webley & Son. In 1897, Webley amalgamated with W & C Scott and Sons to become The Webley & Scott Revolver and Arms Company Ltd of Birmingham.\nWebley's revolvers became the official British sidearm in 1887, remaining in British service until 1964. After 1921, however, Webley service revolvers were manufactured by the government-owned Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield.\nIn 1932 the Enfield No.2 .38 inch calibre revolver, became the standard British service revolver. However, wartime shortages ensured that all marks of the Webley, including models in .455 and .38/200, remained in use through World War Two. The .455 Mk.VI was declared obsolete in 1945 but the .38 Mk.IV remained in service as a substitute standard weapon into the early 1960s.\nIn 1920, the passing of the Firearms Act in the UK, which limited the availability of handguns to civilians, caused their sales to plummet. The company adapted by producing pneumatic guns, their first being the Mark I air pistol.\nDemand for air guns increased rapidly in the 1920s and Webley's business began to grow again, with an inevitable peak related to weapons supply for British military use during the Second World War.  Declining sales led to the decision to give up firearms manufacture completely in 1979, however air gun production at the Birmingham factory continued until 22 December 2005, when the company closed down. Webley's dependent company - Venom Custom Shop - ceased trading as well. It was then bought by Wolverhampton-based company Airgunsport.

They also had a single deck devoted entirely to cabins with private balconies instead of oceanview cabins. The first ship, Sovereign of the Seas launched in 1988, was the world's largest passenger ship in service, breaking the record held by SS Norway (originally designed as an ocean liner). Sovereign held this distinction until 1990 when Norway succeeded her after being refurbished with the addition of two more decks. In 1991, Royal Caribbean International launched a slightly modified sister ship, Monarch of the Seas. In 1992, the line launched its third and final sister ship, Majesty of the Seas. These ships were among the largest modern cruise ships to sail during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nDuring that time, other major cruise lines also followed suit, building ships that included many of the same features and similar dimensions as the Sovereign class. Carnival Cruise Lines launched the Fantasy class in 1990, comparable in size to the Sovereign class and also featuring a multi-story atrium with glass elevators. Princess Cruises also countered by launching two ships in 1990 and 1991 to compete with the Sovereign class,  Crown Princess and Regal Princess. They also featured an atrium and two decks devoted to cabins with private balconies instead of windowed \"oceanview\" cabins. Since then, newer and larger ships have exceeded the size of the Sovereign-class ships. They are less than half the size of the Freedom-class ships and about a third the size of Oasis-class ships.\nIn 2007, Monarch of the Seas became the first major cruise liner in the world to be captained by a woman, the Swede Karin Stahre Janson, who remained the only one until 2010 when the British captain Sarah Breton took charge of MS Artemis of P&O Cruises.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd transferred Sovereign of the Seas and Monarch of the Seas from Royal Caribbean International to their Pullmantur Cruises subsidiary in 2008 and 2013, respectively.

Under the skin, the 2300 was based technically on the older Alfa Romeo 1900. The gear box of the 2300 was conventionally located adjacent to the engine and not (as with the Alfetta) across the rear axle. Like its Brazilian predecessor, the FNM 2000, the 2300 featured a four-cylinder twin camshaft engine, now of 2,310 cc with a claimed output of 140 hp (100 kW).

This model was supposedly manufactured until November 1986, although a final 243 Alfa Romeos were built in Brazil in 1987.As demand for ethanol-powered cars rose, a stockpile of petrol-powered 2300s built up: as a result, Alfa Romeo foisted the Brazilian Alfa Romeo onto European (Dutch, Swiss, and German) importers in 1981 under the designation Alfa Romeo 2300 Rio. Around 600 of the cars were shipped to The Netherlands. The cars proved nearly unsellable and severe quality issues further deteriorated Alfa Romeo's image in Central and Northern Europe, with the importers eventually being forced to buy back the majority of the cars brought over. In the Netherlands, the bought back cars were sold on to used car dealers after three years in outdoors storage; without warranties the already decaying cars caused severe damage to Alfa Romeo's already crumbling reputation.

The Alhambra has seven seats\u2014the five rear seats can be folded down or unclipped and removed completely. When removed the seats leave a flat-floored load space, a unique feature for SEAT vehicles at that time. The load volume varies, from 256l with seven seats, to 852l with five seats, and 2610l with only the two front seats fitted.\nThe Alhambra was essentially unchanged from 1996 to 2010 but a major restyling in the year 2000 reflected the new SEAT image. Even so, the Alhambra remained faithful to the original design produced under the Volkswagen Group and Ford technology sharing agreement. When Volkswagen and Ford lost market share to other manufacture's MPVs, including the Toyota Previa and Mitsubishi Space Wagon, they changed the design of their versions.\nThe Alhambra, Sharan, and Galaxy were built on the same production line at the joint venture AutoEuropa plant in Palmela, Portugal, and were essentially the same but with different engine options and interiors. Ford has now withdrawn from the collaboration, and the Galaxy Mk III and the S-Max (a seven-seater based on the Mondeo Mk IV platform) are built in Genk, Belgium, alongside the Mondeo.

Its acronymous name was changed to upper- and lower-case Fiat in 1906. Agnelli led the company until his death in 1945, while Vittorio Valletta administered the firm's daily activities. Its first car, the 3 \u00bd CV, of which only 24 copies were built, all bodied by Alessio of Turin, strongly resembled contemporary Benz, and had a 697 cc (42.5 cu in) boxer twin engine. In 1903, Fiat produced its first truck. In 1908, the first Fiat was exported to the US. That same year, the first Fiat aircraft engine was produced. Also around the same time, Fiat taxis became popular in Europe.By 1910, Fiat was the largest automotive company in Italy \u2014 a position it has retained since. That same year, a new plant was built in Poughkeepsie, NY, by the newly founded American F.I.A.T. Automobile Company. Owning a Fiat at that time was a sign of distinction. The cost of a Fiat in the US was initially $4,000 and rose up to $6,400 in 1918, compared to $825 for a Ford Model T in 1908, and $525 in 1918, respectively. During World War I, Fiat had to devote all of its factories to supplying the Allies with aircraft, engines, machine guns, trucks, and ambulances. Upon the entry of the US into the war in 1917, the factory was shut down as US regulations became too burdensome. After the war, Fiat introduced its first tractor, the 702. By the early 1920s, Fiat had a market share in Italy of 80%.In 1921, workers seized Fiat's plants and hoisted the red flag of communism over them. Agnelli responded by quitting the company. However, the Italian Socialist Party and its ally organization, the Italian General Confederation of Labour, in an effort to effect a compromise with the centrist parties ordered the occupation ended. In 1922, Fiat began to build the famous Lingotto car factory\u2014then the largest in Europe\u2014which opened in 1923. It was the first Fiat factory to use assembly lines; by 1925, Fiat controlled 87% of the Italian car market. In 1928, with the 509, Fiat included insurance in the purchase price.Fiat made military machinery and vehicles during World War II for the Italian army and Regia Aeronautica and later for the Germans. Fiat made fighter aircraft like the biplane CR.42 Falco, which was one of the most common Italian aircraft, along with Savoia-Marchettis, as well as light tanks, obsolete compared to their German and Soviet counterparts, and armoured vehicles. The best Fiat aircraft was the G.55 fighter, which arrived too late and in too limited numbers to impact the outcome of the war.\nIn 1945, the National Liberation Committee removed the Agnelli family from leadership roles in Fiat because of its ties to Mussolini's government. These were not returned until 1963, when Giovanni's grandson, Gianni, took over as general manager until 1966 and as chairman until 1996.Fiat launched a nuclear research program in the 1950s.

About thirty of the Mark IX sports racing cars were made. It was closely related to the Lotus model Mark VIII (1954), of which only about seven cars were made. These cars were largely based on the innovative space frame of the Lotus Mark VI (1952).  The highly aerodynamic bodies were designed by Frank Costin and constructed by Williams & Pritchard Limited.\nDuring this early era, of 1954\u20131955, Lotus Engineering was still a fledgling company, and cars were delivered in different states of completion on special orders.  Similar to the Mark VIII, the Mark IX was available in various configurations and different engines, including the 1500 cc MG, 1500 cc Connaught and 2-litre Bristol were fitted. However, the Mark IX designation is most often powered by the 1100 cc Coventry Climax engine. Apparently, two models of Mark IX were offered \u2013 the \"Club\" and the \"Le Mans\", the latter of which had larger drum brakes fitted.\n\nThe chassis of the Mark IX was a new design, compared to that of the Mark VIII. Both were space frames of brazed steel tube. The new chassis was an advance over the Mark VIII in terms of the efficiency of its design and avoiding the VIII's need for diaphragm-stiffening panels. However, both chassis still used an oversized lower rail of 1.8-inch (5 cm) tube, a hang-over from the original design of the first Mark VI space frame. Compared to the Mark VIII, the Mark IX was shortened somewhat to a wheelbase of 7 feet 3.5 inches (2.22 m), and the body itself was about two feet (0.6 m) shorter than that of the Mark VIII. This was so that Colin Chapman could fit it on his transporter.A total of about thirty of the Mark IX sports racing cars were produced in various forms, and these were successfully raced in both Europe and the US. The first two examples of the Mark IX were apparently delivered to the US with the 1100 cc Coventry Climax engine to compete in the 1955 running of the 12 Hours of Sebring race and were beaten by a Porsche Spyder.  These cars were actually entered as Lotus Mark VIII models in the G class by Frank Miller of Larchmont, NY and by Bobby Burns and Norman J. Scott of Houston TX in, respectively, car numbers 78 and 79. The Lotus Works Team entered at least one Mark IX in the Le Mans 24 hour race in 1955, driven by Chapman, which may have been equipped with disc brakes. However, the car was disqualified apparently due to his reversing the car to re-enter the race track after going off course.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}
