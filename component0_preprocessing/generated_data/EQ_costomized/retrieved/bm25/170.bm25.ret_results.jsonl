It was part of French North Africa with French Algeria and the Protectorate of Morocco, and more broadly of the French Empire. Tunisian sovereignty was more reduced in 1883, the Bey was only signing the decrees and laws prepared by the Resident General of France in Tunisia. The Tunisian government at the local level remained in place, and was only coordinating between Tunisians and the administrations set up on the model of what existed in France. The Tunisian government's budget was quickly cleaned up, which made it possible to launch multiple infrastructure construction programs (roads, railways, ports, lighthouses, schools, hospitals, etc.) and the reforms that took place during the Beylik era contributed to this, which completely transformed the country above all for the benefit of the settlers, mostly Italians whose numbers were growing rapidly. A whole land legislation was put in place allowing the acquisition or the confiscation of land in order to create lots of colonization resold to the French colonists.\nThe first nationalist party, Destour, was created in 1920, but its political activity decreased rapidly in 1922. However, Tunisians educated in French universities revived the nationalist movement. A new party, the Neo Destour, was created in 1934 whose methods quickly showed their effectiveness. Police repression only accentuated the mobilization of the Tunisian people. The occupation of the country in 1942 by Germany and the deposition of Moncef Bey in 1943 by the French authorities reinforced the exasperation of the population. After three years of guerrilla, internal autonomy was granted in 1955. The protectorate was finally abolished on 20 March 1956.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was commissioned by the Farnese family and painted during Titian's visit to Rome between autumn 1545 and June 1546. It depicts the scabrous relationship between Pope Paul III and his grandsons, Ottavio and Alessandro Farnese. Ottavio is shown in the act of kneeling, to his left; Alessandro, wearing a cardinal's dress, stands behind him to his right. The painting explores the effects of ageing and the manoeuvring behind succession; Paul was at the time in his late seventies and ruling in an uncertain political climate as Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor came into ascendancy.\nPaul was not a religious man; he viewed the papacy as a means to consolidate his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of nepotism, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent large sums of church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the political and military advantage, weakening Paul's hold on the papacy. Aware of the changing tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before completion, and for the next 100 years the painting languished unframed in a Farnese cellar.\nPope Paul III and His Grandsons ranks as one of Titian's finest and most penetrating works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Originating in the comics is the boys' membership in the Boy Scouts of America-like organization, the Junior Woodchucks, including their use of the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook, a fantastically exhaustive field guide containing information on science, history and survival skills. This youth organization, which has twin goals of preserving knowledge and protecting the environment, was instrumental in transforming the three brothers from \"little hellions\" to upstanding young ducks.\nIn Disney comic writer Don Rosa's continuity, Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck were born around 1940 in Duckburg. In his award-winning epic series, Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, Rosa reveals the domestic pain felt by the boys' loss of their parents. When Scrooge first meets Donald and his nephews, he says: \"I'm not used to relatives, either! The few I had seem to have... disappeared!\" Huey, Dewey, and Louie respond: \"We know how that feels, Unca Scrooge!\"\nIn Some Heir Over the Rainbow by Carl Barks, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, along with Donald Duck and Gladstone Gander, are tested by Scrooge McDuck, who wants to pick an heir to his fortune. Using the legend of a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, Scrooge secretly gives the nephews, Donald and their cousin each $1,000 to invest. Donald uses his money for a down payment of a new car, now being $1,000 in debt. Gladstone, considering himself too lucky to need the money this soon, hides the money for when and if he needs it, causing Scrooge to consider him a better option than Donald. Huey, Dewey, and Louie lend their money to a man who claims to need the money to search for a treasure. Initially thinking they were tricked out of the money, Scrooge actually considers leaving his fortune to Gladstone, even though he sees that as \"an awful injustice to the world\", but the man actually finds the treasure and pays the kids back. Scrooge makes Huey, Dewey, and Louie his heirs. It seems to be the most solidly canon indication of Scrooge's plans.\nIn a 1994 interview, Erik Svane asked Barks who would inherit Scrooge's money. Barks' response was \"Probably Donald's nephews.\" Svane further queried, \"Why would Huey, Dewey and Louie receive it?\" Barks: \"Oh, well, because they are so much more practical than Donald. In the later stories, as I developed those duck people and the whole community of Duckburg and all of its problems, I began giving those kids much more intelligence than anybody else in Duckburg. And so, I guess that when Uncle Scrooge passes on, he will leave all of his money to his three nephews. And I'm sure they will do a lot of good in the world, their Junior Woodchucks organization.

Caravaggio scholar John Gash, however, identifies the flowers as \"definitely jasmine\", symbol of erotic love, and therefore more suitable to a courtesan than to a respectable married woman. The portrait belonged to Caravaggio's patron, Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and the 1638 inventory of the Giustiniani collection lists a \"portrait of a courtesan named Fillide\", identified by modern scholars as Fillide Melandroni. But the commissioner was Fillide's client nobleman Giulio Strozzi to whom she bequeathed the painting in her will of October 8th 1614.\nIn 2017, Tasmanian artist, Johannes Verhoeff, was given the task to create 2 versions of the \u2018Portrait of a Courtesan\u2019 at MONA (Museum of Old and New, Hobart Tasmania). This was part of an experiment to determine if a theory put forward by Caravaggio expert, Dr. Roberta Lupucci of Florence, Italy, could be true. Lapucci proposed that the original painting was made with the help of a number of optical devises which caused a facial distortion claimed to be quite noticeable in the portrait. Verhoeff was tasked to make one recreation with the original distortion, whereas the second painting was created to represent Fillide as she could have looked without the optical distortion. Both paintings now belong to MONA.\nFillide figured prominently in Caravaggio's work in the closing years of the 1590s, appearing as Saint Catherine, as Mary in Martha and Mary Magdalene, and as Judith in Judith Beheading Holofernes. She may have appeared even more frequently - a considerable number of Caravaggio's works are now lost - but she seems to vanish from his paintings after 1599. If sophisticated patrons such as Giustiniani represented one pole of Caravaggio's life, the world of Fillide was the other. She was one of Rome's most successful prostitutes, much sought after by the Roman elite; but she had her true existence in the streets. In February 1599 she was arrested together with a young man named Ranuccio Tomassoni, who seems to have been her pimp, (he came from a good family but was continually turning up in police records in the company of prostitutes, and not as a customer), and charged with creating a disturbance in connection with a noisy mardi gras party in her house. Fillide's friends included another prostitute, Anna Bianchini, who modelled for Caravaggio as Mary Magdalene in his Penitent Magdalene, as Martha (opposite Fillide) in Martha and Mary Magdalene, and as the Mother of Christ in Rest on the Flight into Egypt. Tomassoni would also appear again, but not in paintings: in 1606 Caravaggio killed Tomassoni in an attempt to castrate him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The city has the shape of a square with a central park and two main diagonal avenues, north to south and east to west. In addition, there are numerous other shorter diagonal streets. This design is copied in a self-similar manner in small blocks of six by six blocks in length. For every six blocks, there is a small park or square. Other than the diagonal streets, all streets are on a rectangular grid and are numbered consecutively. Thus, La Plata is nicknamed \"la ciudad de las diagonales\" (city of diagonals). It is also called \"la ciudad de los tilos\" (city of linden trees), because of the large number of linden trees lining the many streets and squares. The linden tree is one of a number of deciduous Northern Hemisphere tree species which dominate La Plata's parks and streets; ash, horsechestnut, plane, sweetgum and tulip tree are among the other examples. Palms and subtropical broadleaf evergreen trees thrive but are comparatively infrequent.\nThe city design and its buildings are noted to possess strong Freemason symbolism as a consequence of both Rocha and Benoit being Freemasons.The designs for the government buildings were chosen in an international architectural competition.

The first appearance of the Spanish Inquisition characters occurs in a drawing room set in \"Jarrow, 1912,\" with a title card featuring a modern British urban area with a nuclear power plant. A mill worker (Graham Chapman) enters the room and tells a woman sitting on a couch knitting (Carol Cleveland) in a thick accent that \"one of the cross beams has gone out askew on the treadle\". When Cleveland says that she cannot understand what he's talking about, Chapman repeats the line without the thick accent, then grows defensive and says, \"I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition!\". Suddenly, the Inquisition\u2014consisting of Cardinal Xim\u00e9nez (Michael Palin) and his assistants, Cardinal Biggles (Terry Jones) (who resembles his namesake Biggles wearing a leather aviator's helmet and goggles) and Cardinal Fang (Terry Gilliam)\u2014burst into the room to the sound of a jarring musical sting. Xim\u00e9nez shouts, with a particular and high-pitched emphasis on the first word: \"No-body expects the Spanish Inquisition!\".\nAfter entering, Xim\u00e9nez begins enumerating their weapons, but interrupts himself as he keeps forgetting to mention additional weapons and has to begin numbering his list over again. After several attempts, Xim\u00e9nez states that he will come in again and herds the Inquisition back off the set. The straight man mill worker repeats the cue line, the Inquisition bursts back in (complete with jarring chord), and the introduction is tried anew. But Xim\u00e9nez fails again and tries to get Cardinal Biggles to do the introduction, but Biggles is also unsuccessful.\nXim\u00e9nez decides to forget the introduction and has Cardinal Fang read out charges of heresy against Cleveland who pleads \"innocent\", and the cardinals respond with \"diabolical laughter\" and threats. Xim\u00e9nez intends to torture the woman with \"the rack\", but Cardinal Biggles instead produces a dish-drying rack. This rack is tied to Cleveland and Biggles pretends to turn a lever, but it has no effect whatsoever. As they work, Chapman answers the door to find a BBC employee (John Cleese) requesting him to open a door for a gag on \"the neighboring sketch\", leading into the \"Jokes and Novelties Salesman\" segment.\nThe Inquisition returns in a later sketch as an older woman (Marjorie Wilde) shares photographs from a scrapbook with another woman (Cleveland), who rips them up as they are handed to her. When the older woman presents a photo of the Spanish Inquisition hiding behind the coal shed, Cleveland says, \"I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition!\" The three cardinals then reappear and take the older woman away to a dungeon.\nBiggles tries to torture the woman by poking her repeatedly with soft cushions. When this fails, Xim\u00e9nez orders Fang to get \"the comfy chair\", which is brought out and the woman placed in it. Xim\u00e9nez states that she must stay in the chair \"until lunch time with only a cup of coffee at 11\", and begins to shout at her to confess\u2014only to have Biggles break down and confess. This frustrates Xim\u00e9nez, but he cannot complain about it since he is distracted by a cartoon character from the next scene.\nAt the end of the show, in the \"Court Charades\" sketch, a judge (Jones) who is also a defendant in an obscenity trial at the Old Bailey is casually sentenced by another judge (Chapman) to be burned at the stake. The convicted judge responds, \"Blimey, I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition!\" The whole court rises and looks expectantly at the witness entrance door. As the closing credits of the episode begin, the Inquisitors race out of a house and hop on a double-decker bus to the Old Bailey, all to the tune of \"Devil's Galop\". As the Inquisitors ride in the bus, they comment worriedly that they are running out of credits and are panicked that the episode will soon end. The bus reaches the courthouse and the cardinals charge up the steps of the Old Bailey. They finally burst into the courtroom and Xim\u00e9nez begins to shout, \"NO-body expects the Span...,\" but a black title card with the words, \"THE END\", interrupts him. In resignation, he says, \"Oh, bugger\", and the episode concludes.\nIn the Monty Python Live (Mostly) stage show, the sketch ends when Xim\u00e9nez orders Biggles to \"torture\" the victim (who is sitting in the comfy chair) by giving her a glass of cold milk from the fridge.

Sitting behind him is a satyr, who eats the bunch of grapes slipping out of Bacchus's left hand.  With its swollen breast and abdomen, the figure of Bacchus suggested to Giorgio Vasari \"both the slenderness of a young man and the fleshiness and roundness of a woman\", and its androgynous quality has often been noted (although the testicles are swollen as well). The inspiration for the work appears to be the description in Pliny the Elder's Natural History of a lost bronze sculpture by Praxiteles, depicting \"Bacchus, Drunkenness and a satyr\". The sense of precariousness resulting from a high centre of gravity can be found in a number of later works by the artist, most notably the David and the figures on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.\n\nBacchus is depicted as a naked man who appears to be entranced with his own creation. Its style of nudity is a combination of both ancient proportions and a style which is much more naturalistic. The eyes of Bacchus, staring at the cup of wine in his right hand, are squinted but have a sense of passion in them towards the wine. Bacchus is standing in a traditional pose, but due to his drunkenness he is leaning backwards. His mouth is gaped open and his eyes are rolling, creating a more natural illusion of being tipsy. The sculpture of Bacchus is in the round and contains a compelling sense of antiquity, similar to other sculptures of Bacchus such as Praxiteles' Dionysus. Due to weathering, this sculpture had taken quite a bit of damage over the years. The right hand containing the cup was replaced, the vine shoots had worn, and his penis had been removed. The vine shoots were due to natural weathering and might have assisted in a change of weight in the sculpture. On the other hand, the hand and the penis have a different story. It is possible the damage could have been due to natural causes; however, loss of the two body parts might also have been for the sake of an authentic archaeological appearance. The hand holding the goblet was broken off and the penis chiseled away before Maarten van Heemskerck saw the sculpture in the 1530s.  Only the goblet was restored, in the early 1550s.  The mutilation may have been to give the sculpture an illusion of greater antiquity, placed as it initially was among an antique torso and fragmentary Roman reliefs in Jacopo Galli's Roman garden. Such a concession to \"classical\" sensibilities did not, however, convince Percy Bysshe Shelley of the work's fidelity to \"the spirit and meaning of Bacchus\". He wrote that \"It looks drunken, brutal, and narrow-minded, and has an expression of dissoluteness the most revolting\".

Robbins had previously used Chopin's works in The Concert, Dances at a Gathering, and its follow-up, In the Night.Rehearsals for Other Dances began in spring 1976. At first, Robbins was concerned whether Baryshnikov, who was careful on the details, was \"grasp[ing] the nuances\". However, by the time the ballet was completed, he felt that \"one doesn't begin to say what he can do\". He was also impressed with Makarova's \"ability to do the most difficult adagio dancing with exquisite control and musicality\". Santo Loquasto, the costume designer, found that Robbins \"was on his best behavior\" due to his admiration for Baryshnikov. However, to ease the burden on the dancers and to avoid conflicts, Robbins also created some of the steps for other dancers beforehand.Baryshnikov thought \"the most difficult thing for [Robbins] was to find the form \u2013 the structure \u2013 of the ballet. He approached each section as a musical whole, and then had to work out the sequence in a way that was theatrically sound.\" Robbins would ask Baryshnikov to \"listen to the music\" and explain how he interpreted the music. He also did not use any \"verbal or psychological descriptions\", and used some very brief instructions. In some rehearsals, Robbins would dance Baryshnikov's part and the latter would not dance at all. However, Baryshnikov noted by seeing him dance, he understood what Robbins wanted, and brought him \"closest to dancing it the way he wanted\". It also helped Baryshnikov learn the ballet quicker than he expected. He called Robbins \"stupendous\", and the experience of working with him \"was a complete revelation\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was originally in development under a team from Ocean that was based in San Jose, California. Ocean, which was famous for creating numerous licensed video games, including successful games such as Batman and Jurassic Park, decided to create \"a spy simulation\" game that would be worthy of the Mission: Impossible film. Because the yet unreleased Nintendo 64 was a relatively unknown platform when production started, Mission: Impossible was initially envisioned as an ambitious PC game. Versions for the 32X, Mega Drive, Sega Saturn, and SNES were also planned. The 16-bit versions were reportedly similar to the 2D Flashback. Developer David Dixon, who previously worked on the Amiga version of the 1989 hit RoboCop, created the game's engine. An early version of the game featured character models that were assembled using up to 350 polygons. A new artificial intelligence, called SOOL, was also created, allowing computer-controlled characters to be governed by a complex set of prioritized instructions.In San Jose, the development of Mission: Impossible was marred by an overestimation of what the Nintendo 64 could do, resulting in the game not materializing as intended. This, along with the fact that the developers refused to publish a substandard product, caused the game to be continually delayed. In late 1997, after acquiring Ocean, French video game company Infogrames put a new team in charge of the project. The new team was based in Lyon and was led by Benoit Arribart, who previously worked on the Saturn version of Alone in the Dark 2. When Infogrames took over production, the game was not in a playable state and only ran at 4 frames per second. As a result, the French team had to revise most of the American team's work and remodel the graphics in lower polygon count to improve the frame rate.Nintendo's 1996 game Super Mario 64 and Rare's 1997 game GoldenEye 007 influenced the game's development. Developers had to differentiate the similarly themed Mission: Impossible and GoldenEye 007 as much as possible. A wristwatch interface was planned, but it was ultimately discarded after they saw it in GoldenEye 007. Originally, the player would be able to use the game's \"swap\" identity feature with any character in the game, but the idea was rejected because it required designers to plan every possible scenario. The game was originally intended to support Nintendo's 64DD floppy drive peripheral, which would allow players to access more levels. However, the plan was ultimately discarded because the developers did not have enough \"time to really think about it\".Although the game features the same premise as the film, it is not meant to be a direct translation and has its own story. Viacom, the company that owns the rights of the film, forced the studio to limit the amount of violence and gunplay in the game, while actor Tom Cruise, who played Ethan Hunt in the film, did not want his face to be used in the game. The game's music and sound effects were created in MIDI format. A team in the United States helped the developers make the game sound as rich as possible. During the last months of development, the French team had to work between 16 and 20 hours a day, six days a week to fine-tune the game. The game's size is 12 MB. Overall, Mission: Impossible was developed over the course of three years. It was released in North America on July 16, 1998, and in Europe on September 25, 1998.Mission: Impossible was ported by German developer X-Ample Architectures and released for the PlayStation console in Europe on October 29, 1999, and in North America on November 22, 1999. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version, the PlayStation version features FMV cutscenes, lighting effects, new music and sound effects, and voice acting for each character. Its release was accompanied by a US$2.5 million marketing campaign. A sequel for the Nintendo 64 was announced, but cancelled prior to release.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The viewer seems to be on a level with the children but also looking down on them.  \nThe two subjects of the painting are the daughters of the illustrator Frederick Barnard \u2013 a friend of Sargent's. Dolly, left, was 11 years old and Polly, right, seven years old; they were chosen for their blonde hair, replacing Sargent's original model, Francis Davis Millet's five-year-old daughter, dark-haired Katherine.\nThe title comes from the refrain of a popular song \"Ye Shepherds Tell Me\" by Joseph Mazzinghi, a pastoral glee for a trio of male voices, which mentions Flora wearing \"A wreath around her head, around her head she wore, Carnation, lily, lily, rose\".The work is set in an English garden at Farnham House in Broadway in the Cotswolds, where Sargent spent the summer of 1885 with Millet shortly after moving to England from Paris to escape the scandal caused by his 1884 painting Portrait of Madame X. The author Robert Louis Stevenson was also staying there while writing A Child's Garden of Verses and his verses inspired Sargent.\nSargent also took inspiration from the lanterns that he saw hanging among trees and lilies while boating on the River Thames at Pangbourne with American artist Edwin Austin Abbey in September 1885.\nSargent wanted to capture the exact level of light at dusk so he painted the picture en plein air \u2013 outdoors and in the Impressionist manner.\nEvery day from September to November 1885, he painted in the few minutes when the light was perfect, giving the picture an overall purple tint of evening.\nThe flowers in the garden died as summer turned to autumn, and they were replaced with artificial flowers.\nSargent resumed painting the following summer at Millet's new home nearby in Broadway and finally finished the painting by the end of October 1886.  \nIn the course of working, Sargent cut down the rectangular canvas, removing approximately 2 feet (61 cm) from the left side, to leave an approximately square shape.The work received a mixed reception at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1887, with some criticising his \"Frenchified\" style. However, there was also much praise, and Sir Frederic Leighton, President of the Royal Academy, encouraged the Tate Gallery to buy the painting later that year, using money from the Chantrey Bequest. It was the first of Sargent's works to be acquired by a public museum. The painting remains part of the Tate collection and is displayed at Tate Britain.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Escher first printed in 1957. It depicts two interlocking bands wrapped around the frame of a Necker cube.  The bands have what Escher called small \"nodules\" or \"buttonlike protuberances\" that make use of the dome/crater illusion, an optical illusion characterized by shifting perception of depth from concave to convex depending on direction of light and shadow. Escher's interest in reversible perspectives, as seen in Cube with Magic Ribbons, can also be noted in an earlier work, Convex and Concave, first printed in 1955.Although the cube framework in Cube with Magic Ribbons by itself is perfectly possible, the interlocking of the \"magical\" bands within it is impossible. Escher scholar Bruno Ernst argues that this print is significant for being the first of four Escher drawings to use impossible object.  However, there is debate as to whether the figure constitutes a true visual impossibility or is merely ambiguous, as the bands do not have continuous contours that unite their front and back faces, meaning they lose their visible boundaries when they cross over each other.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

That book turned into What It's Like Being Alone.\nPeyton explained the writing by saying \"it always comes out of an emotional place.\"  One of the writers was Karen Walton, who had previously written the Canadian werewolf film Ginger Snaps. The producers chose the type of animation due to Peyton's personal interest in it, although he later claimed that a day's work could lead to seconds' worth of material. A factory was needed with 8 to 10 teams, with some of the animators having previously worked on the Tim Burton film Corpse Bride.  The characters were made out of plastic and foam. Additionally, some animation was done through computers. Each character's figure had a number of add-on lips to express various sounds, and their eyes and eyebrows were also adjusted frequently during production.  The figures could also be fastened into a surface, moved and fastened in again to portray movement.  Peyton remarked that \"The hardest thing is timing and pacing.\"  Still, he also liked to emphasize that the series did not cost too much money to produce.The airing of the series had been stalled for a year, perhaps due to difficulties within the CBC. To get CBC to adopt the series, Peyton showed the company a commercial with the CBC logo in blood, remarking that \"It's been way too long that you've waited to have your logo covered in blood.\" He had also said that What It's Like Being Alone was meant to attract university and high school students as an audience, and he felt that these people did not ordinarily watch the CBC. CBC itself was looking for original material, and was enthusiastic about the series because it seemed to stand out among Canadian television productions. Peyton's co-producer was Fred Fuchs, who later rose in the CBC staff; one critic believed Fuchs' promotion to be a reason why CBC adopted the series.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "170_43", "question": "Who was The Nightmare created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_13848", "text": "The Nightmare simultaneously offers both the image of a dream\u2014by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman\u2014and a dream image\u2014in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman draped over the end of a bed with her head hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.\nFor contemporary viewers, the relationship of the incubus and the horse (mare) evoked the notion of nightmares. The work was likely inspired by the waking dreams experienced by Fuseli and his contemporaries, who found that these experiences related to folkloric beliefs like the Germanic tales about demons and witches that possessed people who slept alone. In these stories, men were visited by horses or hags, giving rise to the terms \"hag-riding\" and \"mare-riding\", and women were believed to engage in sex with the devil. The etymology of the word \"nightmare\", however, does not relate to horses. Rather, the word is derived from mara, a Scandinavian mythological term referring to a spirit sent to torment or suffocate sleepers. The early meaning of nightmare included the sleeper's experience of weight on the chest combined with sleep paralysis, dyspnea, or a feeling of dread. The painting incorporates a variety of imagery associated with these ideas, depicting a mare's head and a demon crouched atop the woman.\nSleep and dreams were common subjects for the Z\u00fcrich-born Henry Fuseli, though The Nightmare is unique among his paintings for its lack of reference to literary or religious themes (Fuseli was an ordained minister). His first known painting is Joseph Interpreting the Dreams of the Butler and Baker of Pharaoh (1768), and later he produced The Shepherd's Dream (1798) inspired by John Milton's Paradise Lost, and Richard III Visited by Ghosts (1798) based on Shakespeare's play.\nFuseli's knowledge of art history was broad, allowing critics to propose sources for the painting's elements in antique, classical, and Renaissance art. According to art critic Nicholas Powell, the woman's pose may derive from the Vatican Ariadne, and the style of the incubus from figures at Selinunte, an archaeological site in Sicily. A source for the woman in Giulio Romano's The Dream of Hecuba at the Palazzo del Te has also been proposed. Powell links the horse to a woodcut by the German Renaissance artist Hans Baldung or to the marble Horse Tamers on Quirinal Hill, Rome. Fuseli may have added the horse as an afterthought, since a preliminary chalk sketch did not include it. Its presence in the painting has been viewed as a visual pun on the word \"nightmare\" and a self-conscious reference to folklore\u2014the horse destabilises the painting's conceit and contributes to its Gothic tone.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Set in 1925, the story unravels in Ilh\u00e9us, a quiet northeastern coastal city thriving with cocoa crops and aspirations for progress, even though the traditional ways still rule. Fleeing the drought from the Brazilian backlands, gorgeous Gabriela fascinates everyone with her beauty. At first unaware of the ardent love that will grow between them, Nacib, a Turkish immigrant who owns the Vesuvio bar, hires Gabriela (played by Juliana Paes \u2013 India, A Love Story) to cook at his establishment. She waits on the Colonels whose political powers dictate the gossip ridden town. But Gabriela's irresistible beauty and earthy sensuality continue to unintentionally trigger every man's lustful desire, driving Nacib to the brink of jealous insanity.  He realizes he cannot live without her, and when he finds out his burning passion is mutual, Nacib asks Gabriela to marry him. Gabriela accepts his proposal, much to the dismay of the colonels who long for her. When they aren\u2019t hanging out at Nacib's bar drinking, the colonels are either oppressing their wives and daughters or spending money at Bataclan, the opulent local brothel.  Most men in town converge there to be entertained by scantily clad, chic local prostitutes. Colonel Ramiro Bastos has the last word when it comes to keeping the town conservative.  But new arrival Mundinho Falc\u00e3o, a handsome young liberalist who challenges the colonels\u2019 imposed control, falls madly in love with Colonel Bastos' granddaughter, Gerusa. The young couple will have to stand up to her grandfather, the most powerful man in town, in order to stay together. \nMeanwhile, Gabriela and Nacib will have to face up to the conspiracy of those who wish to break them up. Zarolha, a bitter and heart-broken Bataclan prostitute, struggles to win back Nacib's tenderness. She counts on the help of self-seeking Tonico, Nacib's new so-called friend who secretly pants after Gabriela, and together they plot against the couple. He influences Nacib to bind Gabriela to the social norms that oppose her free nature, unleashing unpredictable consequences. Gabriela's impulsive, unbound spontaneity contrasts with the false morals defined by a society filled with various gossipy, humorous, na\u00efve, seductive, amusing, and mysterious characters. Gabriela's torrid presence in town disturbs the traditional ways and implicit inclinations of the townspeople. In a new version of one of TV's greatest hits, based on the immortal literary work of Jorge Amado, Gabriela renders a vivid portrayal of a steamy love story that incites everyone to tune in to their own inherent desires.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The panels that depicted her betrothal, positioned below the Virgin and Child, and another below Saint Nicholas of one of his miracles have not survived.There is some question about the date, or dates, of the painting.  Original understanding was that the painting was begun in 1505, fitting with Raphael's style at that time, strongly influenced by Perugino. Careful observation revealed that the painting was dated 1507.  One can fairly reasonably assume, however, based upon Raphael's style, that the work was started in 1505 and finished in 1507.The chapel that housed the \"Ansidei Madonna\" was dismantled in 1763 when the church of San Fiorenzo was remodeled.  The chapel was reassembled and now contains a 19th-century copy of its original altarpiece, the \"Ansidei Madonna\", by Raphael. The work was bought by young Lord Robert Spenser in 1764, for an undisclosed, but apparently large sum of money as a gift to his brother, the 4th Duke of Marlborough. Placed in Blenheim Palace, one of the most magnificent buildings in Europe and home of the Duke of Marlborough, the work was sometimes known as the \"Blenheim Madonna.\"\"Ansidei Madonna\", considered \"one of the most perfect pictures of the world\", of the Blenheim Collection was sold by George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough, under the Lord Cairn's Act for \u00a375,000 or nearly unanimously cited at \u00a370,000, which was about $350,000, to the London National Gallery in 1885.

Twelve years later, Meggie visits an old book shop in Europe with her father, unaware that he is secretly looking for a copy of the book Inkheart. Shortly after Mo finds the book, Meggie encounters a horned marten outside the shop and it tries to bite her fingers. A man appears from the shadows, claiming to be an old friend. Mo comes out of the shop, recognizing the man as Dustfinger, who quickly asks him to \"read him back into the book\". Mo flees with Meggie.\nMo takes Meggie to visit her great-aunt Elinor in Italy. There he tells Meggie that nine years ago, while reading to her from Inkheart, he inadvertently brought Dustfinger out of the book and into the real world, through a gift he possessed from birth. Unfortunately, the book's villain, Capricorn, and one of his henchmen, Basta, were also brought out of the book. Fleeing with his infant daughter, Mo realizes Resa has been taken into the book. Capricorn arrives with Basta, who captures the group, destroys Elinor's library and takes Inkheart. Mo, Meggie, and Elinor are taken to Capricorn's new castle in the real world.\nDuring their imprisonment, Mo explains his gift to Meggie and Elinor, stating that when he reads a person or an object out of a book, someone from the real world is sent into it, hence his wife's disappearance. Capricorn forces Mo to use his gift, acquiring treasure from one of the stories in The Arabian Nights, and imprisoning Farid, one of the 40 Thieves. Dustfinger, who was promised a return into the book, is betrayed by Capricorn. The group escapes using the tornado from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\nElinor leaves to recover what is left of her library as the others head for Alassio, the town of Inkheart author Fenoglio, who may have another copy. Dustfinger is initially afraid of learning his fate in the book, but eventually joins them. When they meet Fenoglio, the author's ecstatic reaction to seeing his creation alive leads Dustfinger to learn he dies at the end of the book while trying to save his marten, Gwin. He berates Fenoglio before eventually telling Mo that Resa is trapped in the real castle and has lost her voice.\nMo and Dustfinger take Fenoglio's car and Farid stows away in the trunk. At Fenoglio's house, Meggie begins reading out loud, bringing Toto from The Wizard of Oz. Basta bursts in with his men and takes the group to Capricorn. Elinor, having decided to stay, realizes something is amiss and pursues them. At the castle, Capricorn orders Meggie to bring a monster called the Shadow out of Inkheart and threatens to harm Resa if she does not comply. Mo sneaks into the castle. Dustfinger is captured, but escapes after Meggie informs him of Capricorn's intentions.\nMo attempts to free Meggie and the others, as Capricorn forces her to read the Shadow out of the book. Dustfinger returns to the castle with Farid and sets it on fire. The distraction allows Fenoglio to give Meggie a rewritten part of Inkheart that should help Meggie stop Capricorn's plan. As Elinor arrives with the creatures Capricorn imprisoned, Meggie writes out the story on her arm.

After the Battle of Agincourt he receives a letter, from which he learns that \"my Doll is dead in the 'spital\" from \"malady of France\", i.e. syphilis.

It is often amended to \"Nell\" in modern editions. The Quarto version says \"Doll is sick\", not \"dead\", leaves out the \"my\", and makes no reference to losing a home.It has been suggested that a version of Henry V existed in which Falstaff appeared, perhaps married to Quickly (which he said he would do in Henry IV, Part 2). At the epilogue to Henry IV, Part 2 Shakespeare had promised another play to \"continue the story, with Sir John in it\", but Falstaff does not appear in existing versions of Henry V.

Yamatoya is best known for his own noir crime-thriller-cum pink film Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands (1967). The plot of Naked Seven is an obvious take-off on Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), which it satirizes. American arthouse audiences could appreciate the parody of Kurosawa, but to Japanese audiences the film also served as a reference to director Yasuharu Hasebe's own popular Alleycat Rock series (1970\u201371) from the pre-Roman Porno era. This series featured actress Meiko Kaji in stories about a female motorcycle gang.Having been a director at Nikkatsu since before the Roman Porno days, Hasebe was uncomfortable with the pink film genre, and mixed his first two Roman Pornos with other genres to create interest. Besides the historical-adventure style of Naked Seven, he departed from standard pink style with his next film, Sukeban Deka: Dirty Mary (1974), a tribute to the Dirty Harry films. Naked Seven was successful at the time of its release, and, in their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films (1998), the Weissers give the film three points out of four. Because Naked Seven and Dirty Mary, Hasebe's first two films in the Roman Porno series, had both departed from standard pink themes, Hasebe did not consider them to be Pink Films. After departing Nikkatsu for television, he returned to the studio to direct controversial rape-themed films in the \"Violent Pink\" genre. Hasebe considered the first of these films, Rape! (1976), to be his first true sex film. Through the \"violent pink\" genre, Hasebe had the creative freedom from the strict sex formula, and created such controversial films as Assault! Jack the Ripper (1976) and Rape! 13th Hour (1977). Though Hasebe's films in this genre are generally considered his best work, they remain controversial.Naked Seven was a showcase for Nikkatsu's top starlets of the time. Mari Tanaka, as leader of the gang, had made news headlines through her association with the controversial and persecuted Love Hunter (1972) and its sequel, and was an idol of the anti-establishment. Gensh\u016b Hanayagi was a classical ballerina who came to Nikkatsu's attention through appearance in a television commercial. Her major role in director Noboru Tanaka's later Nikkatsu Roman Porno Secret Chronicles: She-Beast Market (1974) created news in Japan.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The narrative was developed to be played out as a series of virtual \"role-play\" events over the course of four years, influenced by the actions of those taking part in the game.\nAccording to the game's back story, the \"Source\" of all life deep inside the planet created the first forms of life, who called themselves the Xan. They began as a small, perfect, immortal civilization, living in peace and harmony. The Xans' eventual discovery and research of the Source's power lead them to create powerful technology. They built a great civilization, but this made them greedy and arrogant. Two factions formed within the Xan, calling themselves the Redeemed and the Unredeemed. These groups fought over how best to use the Source \u2014 now strained and unstable from their tampering. They tried in vain to fix the problem, but discovered it was too late - the Source would soon destroy the planet. Rubi-Ka was ripped apart in a cataclysm, leaving it a barren rock. The Source, and small fragments of the Xans' dead civilization, were thrown into another dimension known as the Shadowlands. The survivors left in search of other habitable planets, where they planted versions of their species; they hoped that one would prosper and eventually return to Rubi-Ka. Earth was one of their destinations.In the year 28,708 AD, a mining survey ship from the mega-corporation Omni-Tek rediscovered Rubi-Ka. The Interstellar Confederation of Corporations (ICC)  granted Omni-Tek a one thousand-year lease on the planet shortly after. It was a seemingly useless, arid landscape far from civilization, until the discovery of the mineral Notum, unique to Rubi-Ka. Research of Notum and its properties led to major leaps forward in nanotechnology, making possible the creation of powerful new technology, as well as the resurrection of the dead. After terraforming a portion of Rubi-Ka and constructing several cities, outposts, and transportation infrastructure, the company began importing colonists under contract as miners and other professions.The first five hundred years of Omni-Tek's control of Rubi-Ka were marked with an exemplary worker treatment record, but as time passed, their policies degraded. Their scientists' tinkering with the mutating effects of Notum on the colonists in a quest for efficiency lead to large numbers of failed experiments. Survivors of these experiments became the game's four playable races, or Breeds, each designed by Omni-Tek to specialize in a type of work. Together with the original \"Solitus\" race, the genetically engineered Herculean \"Atrox\", the intelligent \"Nanomages\", and the nimble \"Opifexes\", they continued their labor in the midst of an increasingly hostile and totalitarian culture. This caused a significant number of workers to rebel, and begin to trade stolen Notum to a rival corporation. These rebel groups, collectively calling themselves the Clans, fought a series of wars with Omni-Tek over the next several centuries.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Despite the lack of success of these releases, Bridges came to the attention of Bill Lowery, who became her manager, subsidizing Bridges over a roughly two-year period. During this time, he canvassed record labels on her behalf, which led to her signing with Polydor in 1977.\nBridges's self-titled debut album was the inaugural production by Steve Buckingham, who was assigned to produce Bridges after playing guitar on one of her earliest sessions. Bridges and her personal and songwriting partner Susan Hutcheson had written a song entitled \"Disco 'Round\", which, at Buckingham's suggestion, was recorded as \"I Love the Nightlife\", as Buckingham felt that the song was R&B rather than disco (\"Disco 'Round\" was retained as the song's subtitle): Bridges herself would later admit she had had hopes that the song would be received as a Memphis soul number, calling it \"something Al Green might sing\". However, club support was a key factor in the success of the track, which became a \"sleeper\" Top 40 hit, spending 27 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 with a peak of number five, and also appearing on several international hit parades as evinced by the Billboard's \"Hits of the World\" chart. The song was also in the #5 position on the Record World and Cash Box charts. It was also a \"crossover\" hit, receiving play even on country music stations. The cover of the 1978 self-titled LP features an early skyline picture of Atlanta, Georgia.\nIn 1978, Bridges was a Grammy nominee and was the opening act, performing \"I Love the Nightlife\". Bridges' self-titled LP, Alicia Bridges, was also rising on the Billboard, Cash Box and Record World charts, and the LP remained on the charts for up to 35 weeks. Both the LP and the single release were international successes, and \"I Love the Nightlife\" went top-40 in the UK and Germany, Spain and other European countries. Bridges's music was especially popular in Japan. She received an RIAA Certified Gold Record for the sale of over one million copies of her hit single in the United States, as well as a gold record from Canada.\nContrary to the impression created by her success with \"I Love the Nightlife\", Bridges was primarily a singer of R&B, rock, blues and love songs. \"I Love the Nightlife\" has a definite back beat and organ similar to early 1970s R&B; the original intention was for \"I Love the Nightlife\" to be an R&B song, but when Bill Lowery first heard the song, he saw its disco potential: subsequently, a 12\" single remix was created by Jim Burgess, ultimately becoming a worldwide club smash.\n\"I Love the Nightlife\" has been featured in several movies, including Love at First Bite, The Last Days of Disco and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\nBridges's second single, \"Body Heat\", was a rock song with strong electric guitar rhythms. It was a \"rock/dance\" song released at a time when there was some rivalry between disco fans and rock fans; this time period began to see more songs that mixed the genres of rock and disco to create a \"rock/disco\" flavor.\nIn an interview, Bridges mentioned Elvis Presley as the singer who originally aroused her interest in rock music, but she has always considered herself an R&B singer. She cited Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle as her 1970s influences. She said that she did not care for white female singers as a rule, with the exceptions being Joni Mitchell and Janis Joplin. She complained that white women sounded as though they were \"sleepwalking\" through their performances. \"Yeah, I jump around a lot when I'm performing,\" she said.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Pissarro spent time in Rouen in 1896 seeking to paint the industrial modernity of the area. He had earlier made a trip in 1883, and did one series of images of the city then. On this his first 1896 trip he stayed at the H\u00f4tel de Paris in Rouen from January to April 1896, during which time this painting was made. His room overlooked the Seine, and it is from this vantage point that it is painted.The subject is the Pont Boieldieu, an iron bridge completed a few years before in 1885. Across the river is the Gare d'Orl\u00e9ans train station and the Place Carnot square. The painting shows Pissarro's interest in moving beyond traditional landscape paintings of verdant rural scenes. His Rouen series instead focuses on the bustle of the modern city. The Rouen pictures would be followed by a series of paintings of urban Paris. Style-wise, Pont Boieldieu in Rouen, Rainy Weather is a return to Impressionism after a decade of experimenting with Post-Impressionism and Pointillism.  Pissarro deliberately sought out a view of the busy industrial section of the town, and produced a number of paintings of the view from the hotel in different light conditions and different weather. He did another picture of the Pont Boieldieu from the same angle, but in a foggy sunset that is today at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen.\nIn a letter written that year, Pissarro himself describes the painting: \"The theme is the bridge near the Place de la Bourse with the effects of rain, crowds of people coming and going, smoke from the boats, quays with cranes, workers in the foreground, and all this in grey colors glistening in the rain.\" He further wrote, \"what particularly interests me is the motif off the iron bridge in wet weather with all the vehicles, pedestrians, workers on the embankment, boats, smoke, haze in the distance; it's so spirited, so alive.The painting was donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario by Reuben Wells Leonard upon his death in 1937. It is one of six Pissarros on public display in Canada, with two others at the AGO, and the others being at the National Gallery of Canada, Art Gallery of Hamilton and the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria.\nPissarro returned to the city later in the year, staying from September to November at a different hotel, from a balcony of which he executed a painting of the bridge from another angle.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "170_74", "question": "Who was feature integration theory created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_13959", "text": "According to Treisman, the first stage of the feature integration theory is the preattentive stage.  During this stage, different parts of the brain automatically gather information about basic features (colors, shape, movement) that are found in the visual field. The idea that features are automatically separated appears counterintuitive. However, we are not aware of this process because it occurs early in perceptual processing, before we become conscious of the object.\nThe second stage of feature integration theory is the focused attention stage, where a subject combines individual features of an object to perceive the whole object. Combining individual features of an object requires attention, and selecting that object occurs within a \"master map\" of locations. The master map of locations contains all the locations in which features have been detected, with each location in the master map having access to the multiple feature maps. These multiple feature maps, or sub-maps, contain a large storage base of features. Features such as color, shape, orientation, sound, and movement are stored in these sub-maps .When attention is focused at a particular location on the map, the features currently in that position are attended to and are stored in \"object files\". If the object is familiar, associations are made between the object and prior knowledge, which results in identification of that object. This top-down process, using prior knowledge to inform a current situation or decision, is paramount in either identifying or recognizing objects. In support of this stage, researchers often refer to patients with Balint's syndrome. Due to damage in the parietal lobe, these people are unable to focus attention on individual objects. Given a stimulus that requires combining features, people with Balint's syndrome are unable to focus attention long enough to combine the features, providing support for this stage of the theory.\nTreisman distinguishes between two kinds of visual search tasks, \"feature search\" and \"conjunction search\". Feature searches can be performed fast and pre-attentively for targets defined by only one feature, such as color, shape, perceived direction of lighting, movement, or orientation. Features should \"pop out\" during search and should be able to form illusory conjunctions. Conversely, conjunction searches occur with the combination of two or more features and are identified serially. Conjunction search is much slower than feature search and requires conscious attention and effort. In multiple experiments, some referenced in this article, Treisman concluded that color, orientation, and intensity are features for which feature searches may be performed.\nAs a reaction to the feature integration theory, Wolfe (1994) proposed the Guided Search Model 2.0. According to this model, attention is directed to an object or location through a preattentive process. The preattentive process, as Wolfe explains, directs attention in both a bottom-up and top-down way. Information acquired through both bottom-up and top-down processing is ranked according to priority. The priority ranking guides visual search and makes the search more efficient. Whether the Guided Search Model 2.0 or the feature integration theory are \"correct\" theories of visual search is still a hotly debated topic.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The basket contains a selection of summer fruit:\n\n... a good-sized, light-red peach attached to a stem with wormholes in the leaf resembling damage by oriental fruit moth (Orthosia hibisci). Beneath it is a single bicolored apple, shown from a stem perspective with two insect entry holes, probably codling moth, one of which shows secondary rot at the edge; one blushed yellow pear with insect predations resembling damage by leaf roller (Archips argyospita); four figs, two white and two purple\u2014the purple ones dead ripe and splitting along the sides, plus a large fig leaf with a prominent fungal scorch lesion resembling anthracnose (Glomerella cingulata); and a single unblemished quince with a leafy spur showing fungal spots. There are four clusters of grapes, black, red, golden, and white; the red cluster on the right shows several mummied fruit, while the two clusters on the left each show an overripe berry. There are two grape leaves, one severely desiccated and shriveled while the other contains spots and evidence of an egg mass. In the right part of the basket are two green figs and a ripe black one is nestled in the rear on the left. On the sides of the basket are two disembodied shoots: to the right is a grape shoot with two leaves, both showing severe insect predations resembling grasshopper feeding; to the left is a floating spur of quince or pear.\nMuch has been made of the worm-eaten, insect-predated, and generally less than perfect condition of the fruit. In line with the culture of the age, the general theme appears to revolve about the fading beauty, and the natural decaying of all things. Scholars also describe the basket of fruit as a metaphor of the Church.\n\nA recent X-ray study revealed that it was painted on an already used canvas painted with grotesques in the style of Caravaggio's friend Prospero Orsi, who helped the artist in his first breakthrough into the circles of collectors such as his first patron, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, around 1594/1595, and who remained close to him for many years thereafter.Scholars have had more than their usual level of disagreement in assigning a date to the painting: John T. Spike places it in 1596; Catherine Puglisi believes that 1601 is more probable; and practically every year in between has been advanced. Puglisi's reasoning seem solid, (the basket in this painting seems identical with the one in the first of Caravaggio's two versions of Supper at Emmaus - even the quince seems to be the same piece of fruit), but no consensus has emerged.In 1607 it was part of Cardinal Federico Borromeo\u2019s collection, a provenance which raises the plausibility of a conscious reference to the Book of Amos. Borromeo, who was archbishop of Milan, was in Rome approximately 1597-1602 and a house guest of Del Monte in 1599. He had a special interest in the Northern European painters such as Paul Bril and Jan Brueghel the Elder, who were also in Rome at the time, (indeed, he took Breughel into his own household), and in the way they did landscapes and flowers in paintings as subjects in their own right, something not known at the time in Italian art. He would have seen the way Caravaggio did still life as incidental accessories in paintings such as Boy Bitten by a Lizard, Bacchus, in Del Monte's collection, and The Lute Player in the collection of Del Monte's friend Vincenzo Giustiniani. The scholarly Giustiniani wrote a treatise on painting years later, wherein, reflecting the hierarchical conventions of his day, he placed flowers \"and other tiny things\" only fifth on a twelve-scale register, but he said also that Caravaggio once said to him \"that it used to take as much workmanship for him to do a good picture of flowers as it did to do one of human figures.\"\nLike its doppelganger in Supper at Emmaus, the basket seems to teeter on the edge of the picture-space, in danger of falling out of the painting and into the viewer's space instead. In the Supper this is a dramatic device, part of the way in which Caravaggio creates the tension of the scene; here, trompe-l'\u0153il seems to be almost the whole purpose of the painting, if we subtract the possible didactic element. But the single element that no doubt attracted its original owner, and still catches attention today, is the extraordinary quasi-photographic realism of the observation which underlies the illusionism. Basket of Fruit can be compared with the same artist's Still Life with Fruit (c. 1603), a painting which John Spike identifies as \"the source of all subsequent Roman still-life paintings.\"", "hasanswer": true}]}

Michelangelo spent 4 years on the Sistine ceiling during which time he escaped Rome and the job a few times when he fled to his hometown, Florence.

Gombrich writes:\n\nInstead of distributing his figures in equal pairs on both sides of the Madonna, he crammed a jostling crowd of angels into a narrow corner, and left the other side wide open to show the tall figure of the prophet, so reduced in size through the distance that he hardly reaches the Madonna's knee. There can be no doubt, then, that if this be madness there is method in it. The painter wanted to be unorthodox. He wanted to show that the classical solution of perfect harmony is not the only solution conceivable ... Parmigianino and all the artists of his time who deliberately sought to create something new and unexpected, even at the expense of the 'natural' beauty established by the great masters, were perhaps the first 'modern' artists.\nParmigianino has distorted nature for his own artistic purposes, creating a typical Mannerist figura serpentinata. Jesus is also extremely large for a baby, and he lies precariously on Mary's lap as if about to fall at any moment. The Madonna herself is of hardly human proportions\u2014she is almost twice the size of the angels to her right. Her right foot rests on cushions that appear to be only a few inches away from the picture plane, but the foot itself seems to project beyond it, and is thus on \"our\" side of the canvas, breaking the conventions of a framed picture. Her slender hands and long fingers have also led the Italian medical scientist Vito Franco of the University of Palermo to diagnose that Parmigianino's model had the genetic disorder Marfan syndrome affecting her connective tissue.Following a recent restoration of the painting, the unfinished face of an angel just below the Madonna's right elbow can be seen more clearly. Also the angel in the middle of the bottom row now looks at the vase held by the angel on his right, in which can be seen the faint image of a cross. Before the restoration this angel looked down at the Christ child. The changes made during the restoration likely reflect the original painting, which must have been altered at some time in its history. The angel who faces the viewer has a resemblance to Parmigianino's Antea portrait.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

MTV senior vice president and creative director Abby Terkuhle explained that when that show \"became successful, we ... created Daria's character because we wanted a smart female who could serve as the foil\". Daria's original design was created by Bill Peckmann while working for J.J. Sedelmaier Productions during Beavis and Butt-Head's first season. During production of Beavis and Butt-Head's final seasons, MTV representatives, wanting to bring in a higher female demographic to the channel, approached story editor Glenn Eichler, offering a spin-off series for Daria. In 1995, a five-minute pilot, \"Sealed with a Kick\", was created by Eichler and Beavis and Butt-Head staffer Susie Lewis (although written by Sam Johnson and Chris Marcil). Among 4 other animated pilots pitched to the channel, Daria performed the strongest in focus groups, especially among middle-school-aged participants - a fact that bothered MTV initially, as they felt their core audience at the time was instead 18- to 24-year-olds. But after show staff argued that college students don't really watch much television, MTV approved a series order of 13 episodes; both Eichler and Lewis were signed onto the series as executive producers.The first episode of Daria aired on March 3, 1997, roughly nine months before Beavis and Butt-Head ended its original run. Titled \"Esteemsters\", the episode established Daria and her family's move from fictional Highland, the setting of Beavis and Butt-Head, to the new series' equally fictional locale of Lawndale. As well as introducing Daria's parents and younger sister, Quinn, as principal supporting characters, the first episode also introduced Jane Lane, Daria's best friend and confidante. Other than a brief mention of Highland, Daria did not contain any references to Beavis and Butt-Head.\nThe series ran for five seasons, with 13 episodes each, as well as two TV movies and two TV specials. The first movie, Is It Fall Yet?, aired on August 27, 2000, and took place between seasons four and five.

(In reality, Todeschini was buried in the Vatican after his election as Pope.) In the site chosen by Todeschini there had once been an altar for shoemakers, depicting the Nativity. The shoemakers agreed to give the location to the cardinal, provided they received another place within the duomo. Lack of available space, however, meant that the shoemakers still had to share the space with Todeschini. \n\nTodeschini commissioned Andrea Bregno to construct the altar. Bregno worked from 1481 to 1485, as evidenced by the inscription \"OPUS ANDREAE MEDIOLANENSIS MCCCCLXXXV\" under the central niche where the altar's Madonna and Child are now located. Bregno, however, did not realize the marble altarpiece that was meant to frame the c.\u20091390 Madonna of Humility painting by Paolo di Giovanni Fei and the 14 statues \"in the round\" that were meant to fill the various niches and spaces of the altar. The original project included these elements but by 1486, Bregno, now in his 70s, had a breakdown in his physical help. He therefore returned to Rome, leaving the altar incomplete. From then on, only assistants from his workshop labored on the central marble altarpiece, that would enclose the Madonna of Humility. \nGiven Bregno's departure, Todeschini began to look for sculptors that would be able to make the remaining 14 statues. In the end, he entrusted the work to Florentine Pietro Torrigiano. But he made only the Saint Francis in the altar's upper left niche. The agreement between Todeschini and Torrigiano was broken for unknown reasons, which forced the Todeschini to find another artist. \nOn June 19, 1501, with the intercession of the banker Jacopo Galli, a contract was created with the young Michelangelo Buonarroti. Michelangelo had already completed his Vatican Piet\u00e0 to great acclaim. As soon as he began to work on the altarpiece, he began to receive other ambitious commission offers, first among them to sculpt the gigantic Florentine David. These offers made the Sienese altarpiece seem too small a work for the young artist. Michelangelo began the commission slowly and only worked on it occasionally. \nIn 1503, Todeschini was elected pope but died after only 26 days. His heirs convinced Michelangelo, in a new contract dated to October 11, 1504, to complete the statues and the altar enriched by four statues that are found in the lower niches on the sides, realized with the help of assistants. Despite the repeated requests of the Piccolomini family, they did not complete the other envisioned statues. As a result, the archbishop of Siena  Francesco Bandini Piccolomini annulled the contract in the 1530s. From then on, the Piccolomini lost interest in the altar, which has remained incomplete ever since.  \nAt the end of the 18th century, the statue of Madonna and Child was placed in the altar's central niche. That statue was believed, until recently, to be the work of the young Jacopo della Quercia, but critics now attribute it to Giovanni di Cecco. The statue came from the altar of Saint Thomas Aquinas and, before that, the altar of San Jacobo Interciso\u2014both altars in the Siena Duomo.

According to his wife and Xenosaga writer Soraya Saga, due to how they often depicted human characters in their works as \"strong will in a fragile flesh and blood\", KOS-MOS was meant to be the opposite, \"the delicate pieces of soul in an unbreakable vessel\". While she acknowledge she was unable to show the character's story fully within the games, she stated \"I think it must be left veiled for now.\" When writing the game, religious themes were added due to Saga's \"deep interest in the power of belief people have\". Meanwhile the name KOS-MOS in part came from Takahashi's thoughts on Nietzsche's philosophy regarding the \"will of power\".Her design was created by artists Kouichi Mugitani and Kunihiko Tanaka. Several of their designs went unused, however Mugitani would later recycle some of them for his own doujin work. Prior to Mugitani's involvement, the development team had tried to create her design \"in-house\". However, Takahashi was unsatisfied with the submitted work. When Mugitani was hired to create the mecha designs for the game, Takahashi asked him to also create a \"robo girl in a bondage-type outfit\". In Takahashi's eyes, while normally he would stand by his convictions, he instead felt KOS-MOS \"should swing whichever way the wind was blowing\" and wanted to aim for an extreme, even providing Mugatani with pictures of one of his favorite pornographic film actresses. While Mugatani designed her body, her head and face were designed by Tanaka. Tanaka, who was an artist for the Xenosaga project as a whole, not only created her face and headgear, but finalized the design as a whole. Upon seeing the earliest draft, Takahashi felt they have achieved the design he was after, particularly with the abdominal muscles he had given her.Other influences for KOS-MOS' design, particularly her \"Archetype\" body, came from artist Hans Bellmer's doll creations, an artistic direction Takahashi wanted to maintain through her various iterations. Each iteration of KOS-MOS took into account criticisms towards the previous designs. Takahashi noted that while the \"Ver. 4.0\" design of her character is considered the most popular with fans, he himself felt it was the farthest away from the concept he had envisioned, as human influences had started to manifest in her appearance. Though he acknowledged it was created by the design team's consensus, he felt she was too \"human-like\", stating \"A vessel is a vessel and shouldn't mean anything more than that, you shouldn't be fooled into thinking it's anything more than that.\" Mugatani on the other hand appreciated the artistic opportunities her mechanical design afforded, stating \"For those of us who find the inner workings of the female body stimulating, KOS-MOS is a porn star [...] She shows us a beautiful structure of the human body in a different way from the grotesque, with a cool look on her face.\"KOS-MOS's appearance in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 was designed by Tanaka. He wanted to keep the design similar to the original \"Ver.1\" appearance of the character, and something that would represent \"Xenosaga\" in the game as a whole. One significant change they did from previous versions of KOS-MOS was to have her main laser attack come from her visor instead of her chest at Takahashi's suggestion, and he added temporary \"cat ears\" to the sides of it to act as heat sinks. Originally he had considered giving her a \"dress\" of shorts around her shoulders and hips for a \"Gravity Drive\" attack, taking inspiration from magical girl anime Pretty Cure, but the development team felt it was excessive and he agreed. The finalized design was named \"KOS-MOS Re:\", as Tanaka intended it to be a refrain of Mugitani's work on the character.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The arguments centre on the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the difficulties with wavefunction collapse and the related measurement problem, and quantum nonlocality. Perhaps the only consensus that exists about these issues is that there is no consensus. Richard Feynman once said, \"I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.\" According to Steven Weinberg, \"There is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"The views of Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and other physicists are often grouped together as the \"Copenhagen interpretation\". According to these views, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but is instead a final renunciation of the classical idea of \"causality\". Bohr in particular emphasized that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the complementary nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations. Copenhagen-type interpretations were adopted by Nobel laureates in quantum physics, including Bohr, Heisenberg, Schr\u00f6dinger, Feynman, and Zeilinger as well as 21st-century researchers in quantum foundations.Albert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, was troubled by its apparent failure to respect some cherished metaphysical principles, such as determinism and locality. Einstein's long-running exchanges with Bohr about the meaning and status of quantum mechanics are now known as the Bohr\u2013Einstein debates. Einstein believed that underlying quantum mechanics must be a theory that explicitly forbids action at a distance. He argued that quantum mechanics was incomplete, a theory that was valid but not fundamental, analogous to how thermodynamics is valid, but the fundamental theory behind it is statistical mechanics. In 1935, Einstein and his collaborators Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen published an argument that the principle of locality implies the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, a thought experiment later termed the Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox. In 1964, John Bell showed that EPR's principle of locality, together with determinism, was actually incompatible with quantum mechanics: they implied constraints on the correlations produced by distance systems, now known as Bell inequalities, that can be violated by entangled particles. Since then several experiments have been performed to obtain these correlations, with the result that they do in fact violate Bell inequalities, and thus falsify the conjunction of locality with determinism.Bohmian mechanics shows that it is possible to reformulate quantum mechanics to make it deterministic, at the price of making it explicitly nonlocal. It attributes not only a wave function to a physical system, but in addition a real position, that evolves deterministically under a nonlocal guiding equation. The evolution of a physical system is given at all times by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation together with the guiding equation; there is never a collapse of the wave function. This solves the measurement problem.Everett's many-worlds interpretation, formulated in 1956, holds that all the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes. This is a consequence of removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet. All possible states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus, together with the observer, are present in a real physical quantum superposition. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we do not observe the multiverse as a whole, but only one parallel universe at a time. Exactly how this is supposed to work has been the subject of much debate.

It was Swiny in the late 1720s who encouraged the artist to paint small topographical views of Venice with a commercial appeal for tourists and foreign visitors to the city. Sometime before 1728, Canaletto began his association with Smith, an English businessman and collector living in Venice, who was appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744. Smith later became the artist's principal agent and patron, acquiring nearly fifty paintings, one hundred fifty drawings and fifteen rare etchings from Canaletto, the largest and finest single group of the artist's works, which he sold to King George III in 1763.In the 1740s, Canaletto's market was disrupted when the War of the Austrian Succession led to a reduction in the number of British visitors to Venice. Smith also arranged for the publication of a series of etchings of \"capricci\" (or architectural phantasies) (capriccio Italian for fancy) in his vedute ideali, but the returns were not high enough, and in 1746 Canaletto moved to London, to be closer to his market.Whilst in England, between 1749 and 1752 Canaletto lived at number 41 Beak Street in London's Soho district.He remained in England until 1755, producing views of London (including several of the new Westminster Bridge, which was completed during his stay) and of his patrons' houses and castles. These included Northumberland House for Sir Hugh Smithson, Bt., who by marriage later became the 2nd Earl of Northumberland; and Warwick Castle for Lord Brooke, later 1st Earl of Warwick. Smithson was one of the commissioners of Westminster Bridge, and it is \"not impossible\" that he had encouraged Canaletto to come to England and record the beginning of the bridge's life. His 1754 painting of Old Walton Bridge includes an image of Canaletto himself.\nHe was often expected to paint England in the fashion with which he had painted his native city. Canaletto's painting began to suffer from repetitiveness, losing its fluidity, and becoming mechanical to the point that the English art critic George Vertue suggested that the man painting under the name 'Canaletto' was an impostor. This may have been because Canaletto's nephew, Bernardo Bellotto, was also using his uncle's nickname; or more likely because the story had been spread by unscrupulous art dealers who had been passing off copies of Canaletto's own work and were anxious to see him return to Venice. Historian Michael Levey described his work from this period as \"inhibited\".In order to refute this claim the artist, through an advertisement in a newspaper, invited \"any Gentleman\" to inspect his latest painting of St. James's Park at his studio in Silver Street (now Beak Street) off Golden Square; however, his reputation never fully recovered in his lifetime.After his return to Venice, Canaletto was elected to the Venetian Academy in 1763 and appointed prior of the Collegio dei Pittori. He continued to paint until his death in 1768. In his later years, he often worked from old sketches, but he sometimes produced surprising new compositions. He was willing to make subtle alterations to topography for artistic effect.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It probably occupied a wall on the first floor of the house, opposite The Great He-Goat.Like the other Black Paintings, it was transferred to canvas in 1873\u201374 under the supervision of Salvador Mart\u00ednez Cubells, a curator at the Museo del Prado. The owner, Baron Emile d'Erlanger, donated the canvases to the Spanish state in 1881, and they are now on display at the Museo del Prado.A Pilgrimage to San Isidro shows a view of the pilgrimage towards San Isidro's Hermitage of Madrid that is totally opposite to Goya's treatment of the same subject thirty years earlier in The Meadow of San Isidro. If the earlier work was a question of depicting the customs of a traditional holiday in Madrid and providing a reasonably accurate view of the city, the present painting depicts a group of prominent figures in the night, apparently intoxicated and singing with distorted faces. Figures from diverse social strata also figure in the painting. In the foreground a group of humble extraction appears, while farther into the background top hats and nuns' habits can be seen.\nThe topic of the procession was used to emphasize theatrical or satirical aspects; in this respect the picture has parallels to The Burial of the Sardine, painted between 1812 and 1819. The locale of Goya's house, which was the repository for his Black Paintings, had approximately the same vantage point in which we view the pilgrims in his earlier tapestry cartoon. Now, in this darker painting, the procession may be leading up to this very house and into Goya's haunted imagination. \"It is Goya whom they have come to see. And to serenade: for what does it matter to a deaf man that the guitar has no strings?\"\nIt is a recurring theme in Goya's paintings to present a crowd that fades little by little into the distance. Already it was present in San Isidro's Meadow and it was later used frequently in The Disasters of War. At the very edge of this painting the silhouette of the rocky outcroppings and that of the parading multitude coincides; this way, the opened space emphasizes the whole rest of the solid and compact mass, dehumanizing the individuals into a formless group. The exception is a figure to the right whose face can be seen in profile and seems to moan or sing.\nLike the other works in this series, the painting's palette is very diminished. In this case, blacks, ochres, grays and earth tones are applied with very free, energetic brushstrokes. The theme of the loss of identity in crowds in this painting can be seen as a precursor to expressionist painting, particularly the work of James Ensor.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The earliest development goes back to 2002, when DreamWorks first filed for a Rex Havoc trademark. In a plot synopsis revealed in 2005, Rex was to assemble a team of monsters, including Ick!, Dr. Cockroach, the 50,000 Pound Woman and Insectosaurus, to fight aliens for disrupting cable TV service. In the following years, the film's story diverged away from the original Rex Havoc, with directors Conrad Vernon and Rob Letterman finally creating the storyline from scratch.Production designer David James stated that the film is \"a return to what made us nerds in the first place,\" getting classic movie monsters and relaunching them in a contemporary setting. Director Conrad Vernon added that he found it would be a great idea to take hideous monsters and give them personalities and satirize the archetypes. Each of the five monsters has traits traceable to sci-fi/horror B movies from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, although none is a mere copy of an older character. Susan, who grows to be 49 feet 11 inches tall into Ginormica, was inspired by Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. Dr. Cockroach represents The Fly and The Curse of Frankenstein, while B.O.B. is an amalgam of slithering and slimy characters that were featured in the films, including The Blob and The Crawling Eye. Insectosaurus, a 350-foot-tall monster, is a nod to the 1961 Kaiju film Mothra. According to Vernon, the Missing Link has no direct inspiration. He \"just represents anything prehistoric that comes back to life and terrorizes people.\" For the San Francisco sequence, the producers researched many films and photographs for an accurate depiction of the city, and filmed animator Line Andersen, who had a similar body type to Ginormica\u2014tall, thin, and athletic-looking\u2014walking alongside a scale model of San Francisco, to capture better how a person not comfortable with being too big with an environment would walk around it.Ed Leonard, CTO of DreamWorks Animation, says it took approximately 45.6 million computing hours to make Monsters vs. Aliens, more than eight times as many as the original Shrek.

It was originally in development under a team from Ocean that was based in San Jose, California. Ocean, which was famous for creating numerous licensed video games, including successful games such as Batman and Jurassic Park, decided to create \"a spy simulation\" game that would be worthy of the Mission: Impossible film. Because the yet unreleased Nintendo 64 was a relatively unknown platform when production started, Mission: Impossible was initially envisioned as an ambitious PC game. Versions for the 32X, Mega Drive, Sega Saturn, and SNES were also planned. The 16-bit versions were reportedly similar to the 2D Flashback. Developer David Dixon, who previously worked on the Amiga version of the 1989 hit RoboCop, created the game's engine. An early version of the game featured character models that were assembled using up to 350 polygons. A new artificial intelligence, called SOOL, was also created, allowing computer-controlled characters to be governed by a complex set of prioritized instructions.In San Jose, the development of Mission: Impossible was marred by an overestimation of what the Nintendo 64 could do, resulting in the game not materializing as intended. This, along with the fact that the developers refused to publish a substandard product, caused the game to be continually delayed. In late 1997, after acquiring Ocean, French video game company Infogrames put a new team in charge of the project. The new team was based in Lyon and was led by Benoit Arribart, who previously worked on the Saturn version of Alone in the Dark 2. When Infogrames took over production, the game was not in a playable state and only ran at 4 frames per second. As a result, the French team had to revise most of the American team's work and remodel the graphics in lower polygon count to improve the frame rate.Nintendo's 1996 game Super Mario 64 and Rare's 1997 game GoldenEye 007 influenced the game's development. Developers had to differentiate the similarly themed Mission: Impossible and GoldenEye 007 as much as possible. A wristwatch interface was planned, but it was ultimately discarded after they saw it in GoldenEye 007. Originally, the player would be able to use the game's \"swap\" identity feature with any character in the game, but the idea was rejected because it required designers to plan every possible scenario. The game was originally intended to support Nintendo's 64DD floppy drive peripheral, which would allow players to access more levels. However, the plan was ultimately discarded because the developers did not have enough \"time to really think about it\".Although the game features the same premise as the film, it is not meant to be a direct translation and has its own story. Viacom, the company that owns the rights of the film, forced the studio to limit the amount of violence and gunplay in the game, while actor Tom Cruise, who played Ethan Hunt in the film, did not want his face to be used in the game. The game's music and sound effects were created in MIDI format. A team in the United States helped the developers make the game sound as rich as possible. During the last months of development, the French team had to work between 16 and 20 hours a day, six days a week to fine-tune the game. The game's size is 12 MB. Overall, Mission: Impossible was developed over the course of three years. It was released in North America on July 16, 1998, and in Europe on September 25, 1998.Mission: Impossible was ported by German developer X-Ample Architectures and released for the PlayStation console in Europe on October 29, 1999, and in North America on November 22, 1999.

However, the plots severely diverge from each other by the middle of the story, specifically around the time where Roy Mustang's friend Maes Hughes is murdered by the homunculus Envy in disguise. Dante, a former lover of Hohenheim and mentor to the Elric brothers' teacher, is the series' central antagonist. Centuries ago, Hohenheim and Dante perfected methods for making the Philosopher's Stone and achieved immortality by transferring their souls and intellects into other bodies as they age. Hohenheim was eventually overcome with the guilt of sacrificing lives to make the Stone and left Dante. Although Dante can still jump from body to body with the last stone she and Hohenheim created, she is not willing to risk the rebound of creating one herself. She thus uses the homunculi to encourage Edward and Alphonse, along with other equally desperate Alchemists to create another complete Philosopher's Stone for her.When Scar creates the Philosopher's Stone, at the cost of his life as well as the lives of 7,000 soldiers, he infuses it into Alphonse's metal body, which leads to Alphonse's kidnapping. Edward tries to rescue him, but is killed by Envy. However, Alphonse uses the Philosopher's Stone to revive his brother but disappears in the process, along with Envy, who fails to stop him. Dante tries to escape, but she is killed when the homunculus Gluttony, whose mind she had earlier destroyed, fails to recognize his master. After being revived, Edward risks his life to bring back his brother and finds himself in Munich, while Alphonse recovers his original body. Determined to reunite with Alphonse, Edward becomes involved in rocketry research, intending to use that technology to return to his home world. The story concludes in the film adaptation Conqueror of Shamballa, in which Edward's search attracts the attention of the Thule Society, which seeks to enter his homeworld\u2014believing it to be Shamballa\u2014to obtain new weapons to help them in World War II.

For Buffalo Bill, the woman is \"[a] totem animal\". Not only does he want to wear women's skin, he wants to become a woman; he dresses in women's clothes and tucks his penis behind his legs to appear female.

He writes that the character is also a combination of Victor Frankenstein and his monster in how he is the creator gathering body parts and experimenting with his own body. Halberstam writes, \"He does not understand gender as inherent, innate; he reads it only as a surface effect, a representation, an external attribute engineered into identity.\" Buffalo Bill challenges \"the interiority of gender\" by taking skin and remaking it into a costume.Filmmaker Lilly Wachowski, upon coming out as transgender to the Windy City Times in March 2016, singled out The Silence of the Lambs for \"demonizing and vilifying\" the transgender community in media through Buffalo Bill, alleging that Bill has served as a reference for anti-transgender attack adds portraying trans people as potential predators that target women's bathrooms. \"We are not predators, we are prey\" Wachowski said.Bill's character and Silence of the Lambs' claims that Bill is \"not really transsexual\" have been criticized for transphobia by transfeminists, who claimed that it is \"one of the most significant and impactful examples of pop culture transmisogyny\" and it \"encourages disbelief of trans people\u2019s self-identification\".\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is in the middle of Peace Circle, where First Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW intersect. The surrounding area is Union Square, which the monument shares with the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial, James A. Garfield Monument, and the Capitol Reflecting Pool. The front of the monument faces west towards the National Mall while the east side faces the United States Capitol. \nThe idea of a monument honoring men who fought in the Union Navy during the Civil War was spearheaded by Admiral David Dixon Porter, who wanted the monument to stand in Annapolis, Maryland, where his father, Commodore David Porter, had assisted in the installation of the Tripoli Monument. Due to an uneasy relationship between the younger Porter and Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, the monument was not installed in Annapolis. Porter lobbied Congress and an additional $20,000 was allocated to build the base. This was in addition to the $9,000 Porter raised amongst naval personnel and private citizens. Porter chose Franklin Simmons to sculpt the monument's statues, one of many works in Washington, D.C., by Simmons. Architect of the Capitol Edward Clark designed the base. Pieces of the monument began to arrive in 1876, and the final piece arrived in January 1878. Unliked most of the city's war monuments, there was no formal dedication ceremony.\nThe monument is made of Carrara marble, which has led to numerous restorations, since that type of marble is not meant to be outside in the elements. The monument is 44-feet (13.4 m) high and is 10-feet (3 m) long on each side. There were additional pieces that were to be installed, including decorative lampposts and water features, but either due to funding or Welles' intervention, the monument remained unfinished. The monument has become a gathering place during protests and rallies, leading to further deterioration of the marble. People protesting against the Vietnam War, the Three Mile Island accident, and the murder of George Floyd, have gathered at the monument. It was also a site where rioters gathered before the January 6 United States Capitol attack.\nThe Peace monument is a contributing property to four listings on the National Register of Historic Places and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites: the National Mall Historic District, the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site, the collective listing of Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C., and the L'Enfant Plan.

French was already famous for his 1874 The Minute Man statue in Concord, Massachusetts, and other works such as his 1884 John Harvard statue. He was also the personal choice of Bacon, who had already been collaborating with him for nearly 25 years. French resigned his chairmanship of the Fine Arts Commission in Washington, D.C. \u2014 a group closely affiliated with the memorial's design and creation \u2014 and commenced work in December.\n\nFrench had already created (1909\u20131912) a major memorial statue of Lincoln\u2014this one standing\u2014for the Nebraska State Capitol (Abraham Lincoln, 1912) in Lincoln, Nebraska. His previous studies of Lincoln\u2014which included biographies, photographs, and a life mask of Lincoln by Leonard Volk done in 1860\u2014had prepared him for the challenging task of the larger statue. He and Bacon decided that a large seated figure would be most appropriate for the national memorial. French started with a small clay study and subsequently created several plaster models, making subtle changes in the figure's pose or setting. He placed Lincoln not in an ordinary 19th-century seat but in a classical chair, including fasces, a Roman symbol of authority, to convey that the subject was an eminence for all the ages.\n\nThree plaster models of the Lincoln statue are at French's Chesterwood Studio, a National Trust Historic Site in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, including a  plaster sketch (1915) and a six-foot plaster model (1916). The second of French's plasters, created at Chesterwood in the summer of 1916 (inscribed October 31), became the basis of the final work, which was initially envisioned as a 12-foot (3.7 m) bronze. In deciding the size of the final statue, French and Bacon took photographic enlargements of the model to the memorial under construction. Eventually, French's longtime collaborators, the firm of Piccirilli Brothers, were commissioned to do the carving of a much larger sculpture in marble from a quarry near Tate, Georgia.\nFrench's design took a year to transfer to the massive marble blocks. French provided finishing strokes in the carvers' studio in The Bronx, New York City and after the statue was assembled in the memorial on the National Mall in 1920. Lighting the statue was a particular problem. In creating the work, French had understood that a large skylight would provide direct, natural illumination from overhead, but this was not included in the final plans. The horizontal light from the east flattened Lincoln's facial features\u2014making him appear to stare blankly rather than wear a dignified expression\u2014and highlighted his shins. French considered this a disaster. In the end, an arrangement of electric lights was devised to correct this situation.

On the introduction of Lawrence Alma-Tadema he visited Whistler's studio in London; between 1885 and 1887 Whistler's work was a great inspiration for Toorop.The influence of James McNeill Whistler on this portrait of Annie Hall is unmistakably reflected in the dominant use of a brightly illuminated white in Annie's dress and embroidery.

According to these data, Moran was born in London in 1840, the son of Sir Augustus Moran, CB, sometime Minister to Persia.\nHe was educated at Eton College and the University of Oxford before embarking upon a military career. Formerly of the 1st Bangalore Pioneers (Madras), he served in the Jowaki Expedition of 1877\u20131878 and in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, seeing action at the Battle of Char Asiab, 6 October 1879 (for which he was mentioned in despatches); the Battle of Sherpur, 23 December 1879; and at Kabul.\nA devoted sportsman and highly skilled shot, he was author of the books Heavy Game of the Western Himalayas in 1881 and Three Months in the Jungle in 1884, and reportedly once \"crawled down a drain after a wounded man-eating tiger\". Although there was no open scandal after his turning to crime, he was obliged to retire from the army and return to London. Outwardly respectable, with an address in Conduit Street, Mayfair, and membership of the (fictional) Anglo-Indian Club, the Tankerville Club and The Bagatelle Card Club, he was nevertheless recruited by Professor Moriarty, and served as his chief of staff. Ultimately he is used solely for assassinations that required his peculiar skill with the rifle; Holmes mentions the killing of a Mrs. Stuart in 1887 which he suspects (but cannot prove) Moran was involved in. In \"The Final Problem\" (set in 1891), Moran escaped incrimination, and followed the Professor to Reichenbach Falls, where Moran attempted to kill Holmes by rolling boulders upon him.\nThereafter Moran earned a living in London by playing cards at several clubs. When one of the other players, Ronald Adair, noticed that Moran won by cheating and threatened to expose him, Moran murdered Adair with a silenced air rifle that fired revolver bullets. Dr. Watson and the returned Holmes having taken the case, Moran attempted to kill Holmes by firing the air rifle from a vacant house opposite the detective's residence. Holmes having anticipated this, Moran shot a wax effigy of the detective, while Holmes, Watson, and Inspector Lestrade all hid nearby to seize the would-be assassin.\nIn \"The Adventure of the Illustrious Client\", Holmes mentions Moran as still alive (in September 1902). Moran is also mentioned in \"His Last Bow\" as an example of Holmes's many adversaries who have futilely sworn revenge against him.\nColonel Sebastian Moran was also the villain in Doyle's Sherlock Holmes play The Crown Diamond, written in the early 1900s but not performed until 1921.

Caravaggio scholar John Gash, however, identifies the flowers as \"definitely jasmine\", symbol of erotic love, and therefore more suitable to a courtesan than to a respectable married woman. The portrait belonged to Caravaggio's patron, Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and the 1638 inventory of the Giustiniani collection lists a \"portrait of a courtesan named Fillide\", identified by modern scholars as Fillide Melandroni. But the commissioner was Fillide's client nobleman Giulio Strozzi to whom she bequeathed the painting in her will of October 8th 1614.\nIn 2017, Tasmanian artist, Johannes Verhoeff, was given the task to create 2 versions of the \u2018Portrait of a Courtesan\u2019 at MONA (Museum of Old and New, Hobart Tasmania). This was part of an experiment to determine if a theory put forward by Caravaggio expert, Dr. Roberta Lupucci of Florence, Italy, could be true. Lapucci proposed that the original painting was made with the help of a number of optical devises which caused a facial distortion claimed to be quite noticeable in the portrait. Verhoeff was tasked to make one recreation with the original distortion, whereas the second painting was created to represent Fillide as she could have looked without the optical distortion. Both paintings now belong to MONA.\nFillide figured prominently in Caravaggio's work in the closing years of the 1590s, appearing as Saint Catherine, as Mary in Martha and Mary Magdalene, and as Judith in Judith Beheading Holofernes. She may have appeared even more frequently - a considerable number of Caravaggio's works are now lost - but she seems to vanish from his paintings after 1599. If sophisticated patrons such as Giustiniani represented one pole of Caravaggio's life, the world of Fillide was the other. She was one of Rome's most successful prostitutes, much sought after by the Roman elite; but she had her true existence in the streets. In February 1599 she was arrested together with a young man named Ranuccio Tomassoni, who seems to have been her pimp, (he came from a good family but was continually turning up in police records in the company of prostitutes, and not as a customer), and charged with creating a disturbance in connection with a noisy mardi gras party in her house. Fillide's friends included another prostitute, Anna Bianchini, who modelled for Caravaggio as Mary Magdalene in his Penitent Magdalene, as Martha (opposite Fillide) in Martha and Mary Magdalene, and as the Mother of Christ in Rest on the Flight into Egypt. Tomassoni would also appear again, but not in paintings: in 1606 Caravaggio killed Tomassoni in an attempt to castrate him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Following its appearance at an exhibition in 1904 its authorship was disputed, though it has since been accepted as the work of Enguerrand Quarton. It is now in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre.\nThe Piet\u00e0, where the dead Christ is supported by his grieving mother, is a common theme of late-medieval religious art, but this is one of the most striking depictions, \"perhaps the greatest masterpiece produced in France in the 15th century\" (Edward Lucie-Smith). It is distinctive from previous depictions of the subject\u2014which were often characterized by overt displays of grief and trauma\u2014by virtue of its restraint. The composition is stable, with the Virgin's hands together in prayer, rather than clutching the body of Christ. The curved back form of Christ's body is highly original, and the stark, motionless dignity of the other figures is very different from Italian or Netherlandish depictions. The style of the painting is unique for its time: the grouping of the figures appears somewhat primitive, yet the conception evidences both great breadth and delicacy, the latter quality especially evident in the specificity of the portraits and the elegant gesture of St. John's hands at Christ's head.The bare background landscape falls away to a horizon broken by the buildings of Jerusalem, but instead of a sky there is plain gold leaf with stamped and incised haloes, borders and inscriptions. The clerical donor, portrayed with Netherlandish realism, kneels to the left.  The painting came from Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, just across the Rh\u00f4ne from Avignon, and is sometimes known as the \"Villeneuve Piet\u00e0\".\nIt can also be suggested that the buildings depicted on the left background are an imaginary representation of Istanbul and the church of Hagia Sophia. The city had fallen to the Ottomans in 1453, a few years before the estimated creation of the painting and the main subject (Pieta) can be considered as a lament to the fall of the eastern part of Christendom.\nBefore its widely accepted attribution to Quarton, some art historians thought the painting might be by a Catalan or Portuguese master; it was, according to art historian Lawrence Gowing, \"the subject of dispute among protagonists of every school along the seaboard between Lisbon and Messina.\" Quarton, known to be working in Avignon by 1447, painted two pictures there in the early 1450s which bear comparison to this painting.For Gowing,\n\nThe agony of the picture is suffered with a rare restraint. No demonstrative expression could match the tragedy of this body, distended as if dreaming. We are in the presence of the simplicity of sorrow.

{"id": "170_182", "question": "Who was Ecce Homo created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_14327", "text": "Ecce Homo shows Jesus stripped and brought before the people by the members of the Roman council, who are flanked by soldiers. The people mock and jeer Jesus, who wears a Crown of Thorns. His hands are bound with shackles, while the redness of the now raw flesh on his legs, hands and chest attests to the fact that he has been beaten with a scourge. The dialogue between Pilate and the mob is indicated by three Gothic inscriptions placed near the mouths of the protagonists. These function in a similar manner to banderoles or the speech balloons used in modern comic strips. To Pilate's cry of Ecce Homo the mob reply Crucifige Eum (Crucify Him). A third inscription Salve nos Christe redemptor (Save us, Christ Redeemer) can be seen in the lower left of the canvas, from the mouths of what were the representations of two donors, but which were later painted over. Typical of Bosch, the painting is suffused with symbolic imagery. Most notable are the placing two animals traditionally seen as emblems of evil in Christian iconography\u2014an owl perched above Pilate, and a giant toad seen resting on the shield of one of the soldiers.\nThe upper right quadrant of the composition presents an all-but-autonomous cityscape that represents Jerusalem under the familiar guise of a Late Gothic Netherlandish town. Its large open spaces, eerily empty, form the strongest contrast to the densely packed jostle of grotesquely caricatured and exotically garbed figures of the foreground mob.\nThe theme of Ecce Homo was not often taken up by painters before the Renaissance, and Bosch is one of the best known early artists to take on the scene. Typically, this episode of the Passion takes one of two forms. One representation details a literal narration of the event, with the implied conclusion that the judgement offered by one's contemporaries is often, as the art historian Michael Worton wrote, \"flawed, blind, and riven with self-interest.\" This is the tradition to which this work belongs: Christ is shown to be utterly human and is shown as a stooped, humiliated, man. Later High Renaissance depictions focus on the heroic sacrifice Christ is making for the sake of mankind, and often eliminate the jeering mob altogether, to show an accepting Christ almost looking forward to death.Very little is known of Bosch's life, and as with a great many of his paintings, the dating of this work is uncertain. However, because of the relative simplicity of the figures and the fact that, thematically, it closely resembles other works painted during the period, it is generally believed to have been completed between 1475 and 1480. This Ecce Homo contains many elements typical of Netherlandish painting of the time, including homely faces and slight proportions of the figures, who seem to be rendered flatly, while their physique fails to be substantial under their heavy clothes. The recent dendrochronological investigation of the oak panel places the time of the creation of the painting approximately between 1475 and 1485.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He initially trained as a land agent with his mother's brother in Sheffield, but he then started to tour England and Scotland as a minister. He visited the Hebrides in 1812 and Ireland in 1813\u201314.When visiting Newgate prison with Stephen Grellet, Forster was amazed at its state. He contacted Elizabeth Fry and she gathered together a group of women to help with improving prison conditions. Forster thereby alerted Elizabeth Fry to what was to be her life's work.In 1816, Forster married Anna Buxton and they moved to Dorset. When his brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, entered parliament in 1818, he wrote to him to encourage him to take up the cause of slavery. He noted that the slavery trade had been abolished (in 1807 in the British Empire) but there was still the issue of those who were already slaves.Doctrinal differences within the Quakers were created by the views of Elias Hicks of New York. Forster highlighted the issue in 1820. Prominent English evangelical Quakers which included Elizabeth Robson, Forster and Anna Braithwaite, decided to travel to the United States to denounce Hicks' views between 1821 and 1827.Meanwhile, following the Reform Act, William Wilberforce was able to get anti-slavery legislation through parliament. In 1838 legislation replaced slavery with apprenticeship. As a result, in August 1838 800,000 people in the British Empire became nominally free.A picture was commissioned showing William Forster as a member of the new British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society which was formed in 1839 at an important international convention in June 1840. The small extract shown here includes only Samuel Gurney\u2014a banker and fellow Quaker\u2014Forster, and William Allen. Also in this painting are William's brothers, Robert and Josiah Forster. This new society's aim was \"The universal extinction of slavery and the slave trade and the protection of the rights and interests of the enfranchised population in the British possessions and of all persons captured as slaves.\"\nIn 1842-3 a schism developed in the Society of Friends in Salem in Iowa. The difference developed over the ways that the society should support the abolition of slavery, which was still an important part of the American economy. A rival meeting house had been created and a new burial ground purchased which was separated from the older Quaker burial ground by a mere two feet of ground. Four delegates were sent from Britain: Forster, his brother Josiah, George Stacey (pictured above) and John Allen. The difference between the two groups was the level to which they should publicly oppose slavery. It was the group who most supported abolition that had created a minority group called the Abolition Friends. The group did not manage to heal the divide immediately but it was resolved by 1848.Forster and his wife visited France in July 1845 at the invitation of the French to try to establish links with the French abolitionists. They found activity in Paris, but were disappointed to find that there was little activity in the country in general.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "170_201", "question": "Who was Campbell's Soup Campbell created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_14387", "text": "Campbell's Soup Cans is considered Warhol's signature work. For about a year, he made paintings from photographs, by his one-time love interest Edward Wallowitch, taken of soup cans in every condition and from every angle. During this time, he mixed his media (oil- and water-based paints) and cut stencils to help pursue realism. Wallowitch's photographs served as the models for the tracing and copying that resulted in many of his 1961 and 1962 Campbell's Soup cans and dollar bill paintings and drawings. In total, Warhol painted about 50 Campbell's Soup canvases from November 1961 to 1962. The Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 (edited by Georg Frei and Neil Printz) lists the 32-canvas main set, 3 large grid-style paintings (1 of 200 cans and 2 of 100 cans), and about a dozen-and-a-half still lifes. Although Warhol had been trained in art school to paint still-life fruit bowls on a table, he longed to paint his favorite variety of Campbell's Soup (Tomato), remembered from the pantry of his childhood home. Warhol is quoted as saying \"Many an afternoon at lunchtime Mom would open a can of Campbell's for me, because that's all we could afford, I love it to this day.\"Several anecdotal stories supposedly explain why Warhol chose Campbell's Soup cans as the focal point of his pop art. One reason is that he needed a new subject after he abandoned comic strips, a move taken in part due to his respect for the refined work of Roy Lichtenstein. According to Ted Carey\u2014one of Warhol's commercial art assistants in the late 1950s\u2014it was Muriel Latow who suggested the idea for both the soup cans and Warhol's early U.S. dollar paintings. Although Gopnik notes that a variety of incompatible versions of events are told, he presents a version crafted from Latow's recollections, saying that Latow and Carey were visiting Warhol to console him in his predicament of being upstaged in comics. Warhol begged them for ideas and even paid Latow for making her thoughts available. Although Tony Scherman and David Dalton tell a similar origin story, they note that John Mann (Carey's boyfriend) had a different version, where Latow influenced Warhol by asking about what Warhol disliked, which turned out to be grocery shopping, which in turn made him imagine getting Campbell's Soup cans from A&P. Another account of Latow's influence on Warhol holds that she asked him what he loved most, and because he replied \"money\" she suggested that he paint U.S. dollar bills. Latow was then an aspiring interior decorator, and owner of the Latow Art Gallery in the East 60s in Manhattan. She also told Warhol that he should paint \"Something you see every day and something that everybody would recognize. Something like a can of Campbell's Soup.\" Carey said that Warhol responded by exclaiming: \"Oh that sounds fabulous.\" A $50 ($509.8 in 2023) check dated November 23, 1961, in the archive of the Andy Warhol Museum, confirms the story that she charged him for giving him ideas.By one account, according to Carey, Warhol went to a supermarket the following day and bought a case of \"all the soups\", which Carey said he saw when he stopped by Warhol's apartment the next day. When the art critic G. R. Swenson asked Warhol in 1963 why he painted soup cans, the artist replied, \"I used to drink it, I used to have the same lunch every day, for twenty years.\" Another account holds that Warhol instructed his mother to buy a can of each of the 32 varieties of Campbell's Soup from the local A&P. He began with a series of drawings and then made color slides of each, to be projected onto a screen. He tinkered with dimensions and how best to combine the varieties. However, rather than combine them, as was common with supermarket food imagery of the time, he decided to create, with as much realism as he could, individual portraits against a white background.The soup is said to have reminded Warhol of his mother, Julia, who served it to him regularly while raising him during the Great Depression, as Czech immigrants in a Pennsylvania coal mine town. At times, the family could not even afford to splurge on Campbell's Soup and ate soup made from ketchup. It is regarded as doubtful that the Warhols had Campbell's Soup often, since it was marketed as an upscale item, and Julia was a soupmaker who could cook from scratch. It wasn't until the late 1950s that canned soup was targeted toward the working class.In an interview for London's The Face in 1985, David Yarritu asked Warhol about flowers that Warhol's mother made from tin cans. In his response, Warhol talked about them as one of the reasons behind his first tin can paintings:\n\nDavid Yarritu: I heard that your mother used to make these little tin flowers and sell them to help support you in the early days.\nAndy Warhol: Oh God, yes, it's true, the tin flowers were made out of those fruit cans, that's the reason why I did my first tin-can paintings ... You take a tin-can, the bigger the tin-can the better, like the family size ones that peach halves come in, and I think you cut them with scissors. It's very easy and you just make flowers out of them. My mother always had lots of cans around, including the soup cans.Several stories mention that Warhol's choice of soup cans reflected his own avid devotion to Campbell's soup as a consumer. Robert Indiana once said: \"I knew Andy very well. The reason he painted soup cans is that he liked soup.\" He was thought to have focused on them because they composed a daily dietary staple. Others observed that Warhol merely painted things he held close to his heart. He enjoyed eating Campbell's soup, had a taste for Coca-Cola, loved money, and admired movie stars. Thus, they all became subjects of his work. Yet another account says that his daily lunches in his studio consisted of Campbell's Soup and Coca-Cola, and thus his inspiration came from seeing the empty cans and bottles accumulate on his desk.\nWarhol did not choose the cans because of any business relationship with the Campbell Soup Company. Even though the company at the time sold four out of every five cans of prepared soup in the United States, Warhol preferred that the company not be involved, \"because the whole point would be lost with any kind of commercial tie-in.\" However, by 1965, the company knew him well enough that he was able to coax actual can labels from them to use as invitations for an exhibit. They even commissioned a canvas.In 1961, Warhol painted a single \"Campbell's Soup Can\" on a 20-by-15-inch (51 cm \u00d7 38 cm) canvas and gave it to his brother Paul to celebrate the birth of Paul's son Marty. Each of Paul's children was able to exhibit the painting at school. Eventually, the family decided to auction off the work, on November 13, 2002, at Christie's in New York. This work is regarded as one of the inspirations for the later, well-known set.", "hasanswer": false}]}

By 1956, he had set up a studio in the small Italian town of Albisola near Genoa, where he began to compose a large painting that he initially titled La ritirata di Russia (The Retreat from Russia); the painting had been inspired by stories told by his friend Umberto Gambetta, who had fought with the Italians in the Battle of Stalingrad (1942\u20131943) before spending years in Russian prisoner-of-war camps from which few survived. The painting had seemed to have detailed these events to such an extent that Gambetta referred to it as \"my portrait\"; Jorn ensured that all such personal references were covered over so as to enhance the work's universal significance. He then renamed the painting Le fou rire (sometimes translated The Mad Laughter) and sent it off to Brussels where a collector had shown interest in the painting; it was acquired by the restaurant owner Albert Niels who allowed Jorn to work on it further.

The first doesn't meet his expectations and he has it butchered. Alec takes pity on the rhekaro and hates Yhakobin  for torturing and killing it, and is determined to save the second one from a similar fate. Increasingly, Alec feels paternal towards rhekaro, who has Alec's own face - reminding himself of the Dragon Oracle's prophecy that he would \"beget a child of no woman\". Eventually, Seregil and Alec escape, the first with the help of a servant woman and the second by picking his lock. Knowing that the rhekaro will die without his blood, Alec is determined to save him and takes him along, while Seregil brings his betrayer, Ilar \u00ed Sontir, to show them a secret tunnel.\nThe atmosphere is initially tense when Alec finds Ilar's identity and Seregil, too, has doubts about the uncommon-looking child, but they fare well for several days, with Alec's hunting skills and the food they had stolen. Later, the rhekaro, whom Alec names Sebrahn, shows extraordinary healing powers, which they use to get rid of their slave brands so that they are not found out by other slavers.\nNear the port they are found by their former master. Ilar flees in panic, but Alec and Seregil stand firm. The archers target Seregil but Alec jumps in front of him and is killed.

His father, Waylon Smithers Sr., worked for Burns until he died of radiation poisoning after saving Springfield from a potential nuclear meltdown when Smithers was a baby. Smithers began thinking of Mr. Burns as his commander shortly after his birth. Up until 2016, he was not openly gay, but most people knew he was homosexual before he came out. It was revealed in a flashback that he was married to a woman once, but the two split up when Mr. Burns came between them. Smithers is shown to have a passionate and deep love for Mr. Burns, and his sexual orientation has been characterized by the writers of the show as \"Burns-sexual\". \"He deserves his time,\" says the writer of \"The Simpsons\" about Smithers's gay love story in 2021.Mr. Burns remained largely ignorant of Smithers's devoted adoration, much to Smithers's frustration. Mr. Burns himself has been involved with several women and, in \"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\", Smithers is noticeably disgusted when Mr. Burns starts looking for a female companion. Burns, for his part, views Smithers as somewhat of a lackey, albeit a highly valued one for his competence. He has \"rewarded\" Smithers's devotion with the future \"honor\" of being buried alive with him after he dies. Smithers has been shown to be somewhat dependent on his relationship with Burns. In \"Homer the Smithers\", Mr. Burns orders Smithers to take a vacation and Homer Simpson is hired as a temporary replacement. When Homer loses his temper and punches Mr. Burns in the face, Mr. Burns learns to become self-reliant and this results in Smithers being fired. Smithers decides that he needs to be Mr. Burns's assistant and eventually gets his job back. In the season 27 episode \"The Burns Cage\", Smithers attempts to admit his love to Burns, who interrupts to reaffirm his contempt for his assistant.Smithers's official job at the power plant appears to be that of executive assistant, which he says is \"actually about 2,800 smaller jobs\", responsible for monitoring employee attendance, and is often a disciplinarian and has won dozens of employee-of-the-month awards. Smithers does appear to be one of the few people at the power plant who is seemingly competent at their job as opposed to the lazy, oafish underlings such as Homer Simpson and the senile Mr. Burns, who is often out of touch with the modern times. While some of his early appearances showed him to have a malicious side (he tried to get Homer fired over his insurance claim for a hair-growing product, and the only reason this failed is that Mr. Burns had sympathy for Homer due to his own incurable baldness and gave him his old job back), his overall characterization is fairly benevolent and he ultimately just wants the SNPP to run well. He has often hinted at wanting to be promoted to the position of executive vice president, but Burns has repeatedly squashed this dream, while whimsically bestowing the vice presidency on a dog. Smithers has the largest collection of Malibu Stacy dolls in the world, and is the president of the Malibu Stacy fan club.

It was commissioned by Catherine Lescuyer as a commemorative piece for her father. Rubens created it as part of an altarpiece in the Church of St. Rombout (Rumbold) in Mechelen. The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas dressed in blue turning back towards the viewer and away from the table. Other than Jesus, the most prominent figure is Judas. Judas holds his right hand to his mouth with his eyes avoiding direct contact with the other figures in the painting creating a nervous expression. Jesus is dressed in red and has a yellow halo surrounding his head with his face tilted upwards. Jesus is located centrally in the painting surrounded by his disciples with six on each side, and he holds a loaf of bread with a cup of wine in front of him. Out of all of the figures, he is the most in the light with the figures to the farthest left being the most in shadow. \u201cThe scene thus represents a perfect conflation of the theological significance of the Last Supper\u201d meaning the conflation between the blessing of the bread and the wine while still being pivotal in the sense of revealing the betrayal.As in many other Northern European depictions, a dog with a bone can be seen in the scene, probably a simple pet. It may represent  faith, dogs are traditionally symbols of and are representing faith. According to J. Richard Judson the dog near Judas perhaps represents greed or evil, as the companion of Judas, as in John 13:27.This painting followed the first unsuccessful attempt by Rubens to produce a Last Supper in 1611, when his patrons backed out the last minute, perhaps due to the high price of 4,000 Guilder asked by Rubens.Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper fresco was a significant influence on Rubens who created an etching after the Davinci Last Supper, which was one of Rubens' first attempts to express the full range of human emotion printed by Pieter Soutman. Rubens was also influenced by his humanist ideals from which he extracts biblical themes.Rubens often made engravings following the completion of his works. Other artists used these engravings to serve as a basis of their own works. These copies were even collected. The engravings and copies helped to lead to the popularity of Rubens\u2019 works during his lifetime.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In \"Kaa's Hunting\", Bagheera and Baloo enlist Kaa's help to rescue Mowgli when the man-cub is kidnapped by Bandar-log (monkeys) and taken to an abandoned human city called the Cold Lairs. Kaa breaks down the wall of the building in which Mowgli is imprisoned and uses his serpentine hypnosis to draw the monkeys toward his waiting jaws. Bagheera and Baloo are also hypnotized, but Mowgli is immune because he is human and breaks the spell on his friends.\nKaa is a symbol of cold-blooded power, both physically and psychologically.\n\nThen Kaa came straight, quickly, and anxious to kill. The fighting strength of a python is in the driving blow of his head, backed by all the strength and weight of his body. If you can imagine a lance, or a battering-ram, or a hammer, weighing nearly half a ton driven by a cool, quiet mind living in the handle of it, you can imagine roughly what Kaa was like when he fought... Generations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by the stories their elders told them of Kaa, the night-thief, who could slip along the branches as quietly as moss grows, and steal away the strongest monkey that ever lived; of old Kaa, who could make himself look so like a dead branch or a rotten stump that the wisest were deceived till the branch caught them, and then\u2014\nIn The Second Jungle Book, Kaa appears in the first half of the story \"The King's Ankus\". After Kaa and Mowgli spend some time relaxing, bathing and wrestling, Kaa persuades Mowgli to visit a treasure chamber guarded by an old cobra beneath the same Cold Lairs. The cobra tries to kill Mowgli but its venom has dried up. Mowgli takes a jeweled item away as a souvenir, not realizing the trouble it will cause them, and Kaa departs.\nIn \"Red Dog\", Mowgli asks Kaa for help when his wolf pack is threatened by rampaging dholes (the red dogs of the title). Kaa goes into a trance so that he can search his century-long memory for a stratagem to defeat the dogs:\n\nFor a long hour Mowgli lay back among the coils, while Kaa, his head motionless on the ground, thought of all that he had seen and known since the day he came from the egg. \nThe light seemed to go out of his eyes and leave them like stale opals, and now and again he made little stiff passes with his head, right and left, as though he were hunting in his sleep. Mowgli dozed quietly, for he knew that there is nothing like sleep before hunting, and he was trained to take it at any hour of the day or night. \nThen he felt Kaa's back grow bigger and broader below him as the huge python puffed himself out, hissing with the noise of a sword drawn from a steel scabbard;\n\n\"I have seen all the dead seasons\", Kaa said at last, \"and the great trees and the old elephants, and the rocks that were bare and sharp-pointed ere the moss grew. Art thou still alive, Manling?\"\nWith Kaa's help Mowgli tricks the dholes into attacking prematurely. Kaa takes no part in the resulting battle (obliquely citing his loyalty to the boy rather than to the wolves, who often caused Mowgli grief) but Mowgli and the wolves finally kill all the dholes, though not without grievous losses.\nIn \"The Spring Running\", as the teenage Mowgli reluctantly prepares to leave the jungle for the last time, Kaa tells Mowgli that \"it is hard to cast the skin\", but Mowgli knows he must cast the skin of his old life in order to grow a new one. Kaa, Baloo and Bagheera sing for Mowgli in \"The Outsong\", a poem and the ending of \"The Spring Running\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The earliest definitive mention of the Hermitage work dates to the 18th century, when it was probably in the Duke of Angoul\u00eame's collection in Paris.  From there it passed into the collection of Pierre Crozat, which was bought almost in its entirety by Catherine II of Russia in 1772, forming the core of the future Hermitage Museum.The work was restored early in the 19th century, leading Alexander Pushkin to write the poem Renaissance and to refer to the work in his Mozart and Salieri, having his version of Salieri state \"I don't  find it funny when the painter is useless / It stains Raphael's Madonna for me\".

{"id": "170_233", "question": "Who was Quatermass II created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_14507", "text": "The available British television audience had doubled since The Quatermass Experiment had been shown in 1953, and the viewing figures for Quatermass II were accordingly higher. The serial gained an audience of 7.9 million viewers for its first three episodes, rising to 8.3 million for the fourth and fifth and concluding with 9 million. A BBC audience research report commissioned after Quatermass II had finished found that 90% of those questioned in the sample had watched at least five episodes of the production.Quatermass II received positive newspaper reviews in the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt it to be not as good as the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland to spend the rest of her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.The BBC's own website regarded Quatermass II unfavourably when reviewing its DVD release in 2005: \"The script is too often let down by the production's rougher edges. Your heart will break halfway through episode six as it all falls apart. And then there's Monica Gray [sic] \u2013 less an actress than a finishing school on legs\". Writing in The Times in 2006, Morgan Falconer claimed to find racist undertones in the serial: \"Quatermass, for instance, often seemed to have an unhealthy preoccupation with blackness, a barely veiled commentary on racial change in Britain. In one scene in Quatermass II, the Professor stands outside a pub and watches the sky fill with dark asteroids. 'They're coming in their thousands', he says, 'this is it'\". However, this interpretation of the serial is not widespread, and is undermined in episode five where an Irish immigrant helps Quatermass sabotage the aliens' food supply system. In any case, it is in direct contrast with Kneale's deliberate attack on racial intolerance in Quatermass and the Pit.\nSpeaking in a 2003 television documentary about Nigel Kneale's career, the writer and critic Kim Newman praised the underlying themes of Quatermass II, and their particular relevance to the British way of life: \"Quatermass II is the British Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing... What Quatermass II does is take that metaphor and apply it to the specific conditions of Britain in the 1950s; not just the Cold War paranoia, but the traditional British grumbling resentment of bureaucracy as represented by the council, or in this case big business\". The British Film Institute's \"Screenonline\" website also offers praise in its analysis of the serial:\"With its tale of an invasion by an invisible enemy indistinguishable from ourselves, Kneale's story tapped into contemporary fears about the 'red' (i.e. communist) threat, although in a less direct way than the American science fiction films of the 1950s, including Invasion of the Body Snatchers. At the same time, it reflected the widespread anxiety of the nuclear age \u2013 the story begins with a failed test of a nuclear-powered rocket in Australia (at a time when the country was in reality a site for a series of British nuclear weapons tests). In short, Quatermass II was the perfect cold-war drama\".\nSome science fiction fans have speculated that the Quatermass serials in general, and Quatermass II in particular \u2013 with its elements including a conspiracy of silence in the government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any critic who opposes the government's plans \u2013 influenced the successful American series The X-Files (1993\u20132002). Kneale was invited to write for The X-Files during the 1990s, but declined the offer.Other genre productions that have been compared with the serial include the 1970 Doctor Who story Spearhead from Space. This serial features an alien entity falling to Earth in a meteorite shower; a factory taken over for the growth of the alien creature, and governmental institutions being infiltrated by servants of the aliens.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It has been hailed by some critics as one of the greatest photographs of all time because it captures in a single image both a formative document of its time and one of the first works of artistic modernism.\nThere were men and women and children on the lower deck of the steerage. There was a narrow stairway leading to the upper deck of the steerage, a small deck right on the bow with the steamer.\nTo the left was an inclining funnel and from the upper steerage deck there was fastened a gangway bridge that was glistening in its freshly painted state. It was rather long, white, and during the trip remained untouched by anyone.\n\nOn the upper deck, looking over the railing, there was a young man with a straw hat. The shape of the hat was round. He was watching the men and women and children on the lower steerage deck...A round straw hat, the funnel leaning left, the stairway leaning right, the white drawbridge with its railing made of circular chains \u2013 white suspenders crossing on the back of a man in the steerage below, round shapes of iron machinery, a mast cutting into the sky, making a triangular shape...I saw shapes related to each other. I was inspired by a picture of shapes and underlying that the feeling I had about life.\"\nAlthough Stieglitz described \"an inclining funnel\" in the scene, photographs and models of the ship (see below) show that this object was actually a large mast to which booms were fastened for loading and unloading cargo. One of the booms is shown at the very top of the picture.\nMuch has been written about the scene as a cultural document of an important period when many immigrants came to America. In fact, the picture was taken on a cruise to Europe from America, and so some critics have interpreted it as recording people who were turned away by U.S. Immigration officials and forced to go back home. Although some of the passengers might have been turned back because of failure to meet financial or health requirements for entrance, it is more likely most were various artisans who worked in the booming construction trade.

Potter intended to explore the reason why Casanova was \"driven\" to have had so many sexual encounters. As a result, Potter's Casanova is far different from other interpretations of the character; he suffers from tristitia post-coitum (literally, the sadness after sex) and considers his reliance on women for sexual satisfaction a weakness. The serial includes a number of events that depart from established facts about Casanova.\nThe series resulted in a number of complaints to the BBC. Clean-up TV campaigner Mary Whitehouse, who regularly found fault with Potter's work, thought the first two episodes \"boring\" and believed the third used a kind of Playboy flashback photography.

It was commissioned by Catherine Lescuyer as a commemorative piece for her father. Rubens created it as part of an altarpiece in the Church of St. Rombout (Rumbold) in Mechelen. The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas dressed in blue turning back towards the viewer and away from the table. Other than Jesus, the most prominent figure is Judas. Judas holds his right hand to his mouth with his eyes avoiding direct contact with the other figures in the painting creating a nervous expression. Jesus is dressed in red and has a yellow halo surrounding his head with his face tilted upwards. Jesus is located centrally in the painting surrounded by his disciples with six on each side, and he holds a loaf of bread with a cup of wine in front of him. Out of all of the figures, he is the most in the light with the figures to the farthest left being the most in shadow. \u201cThe scene thus represents a perfect conflation of the theological significance of the Last Supper\u201d meaning the conflation between the blessing of the bread and the wine while still being pivotal in the sense of revealing the betrayal.As in many other Northern European depictions, a dog with a bone can be seen in the scene, probably a simple pet. It may represent  faith, dogs are traditionally symbols of and are representing faith. According to J. Richard Judson the dog near Judas perhaps represents greed or evil, as the companion of Judas, as in John 13:27.This painting followed the first unsuccessful attempt by Rubens to produce a Last Supper in 1611, when his patrons backed out the last minute, perhaps due to the high price of 4,000 Guilder asked by Rubens.Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper fresco was a significant influence on Rubens who created an etching after the Davinci Last Supper, which was one of Rubens' first attempts to express the full range of human emotion printed by Pieter Soutman. Rubens was also influenced by his humanist ideals from which he extracts biblical themes.Rubens often made engravings following the completion of his works.

But evidence, both internal and external, support Adler's interpretation: the upended rocks do appear to crush the ship, and the depicted rock formations and Watkins Glen, referred to by Dickinson in discussing the picture's man-made structures, both pertain to his native region of western New York state, as does the trapped weasel, based on one he had found in a glen in Sheldrake.  And neither these, nor the falling rocks are connected with the supposed topic of his painting (described in a letter of 1934 as the \"stranding of Dr. Kane's brig 'Advance' on the Greenland coast\"). Rather, the ruined state of the walkways and stairs and the upended terrain, like the trapped weasel and the crushed ship and whaleboat reinforce the idea of a situation without escape that leaves him feeling trapped and crushed, with the ground collapsing and rocks falling from above. \nBiographical events may also have contributed to Dickinson's feelings: he had a bout with ulcers in 1933; he experienced back pains bad enough to wear a back brace from June 1931 until after Stranded Brig was complete; and on July 1, 1934 he entered the hospital for a battery of tests. The tests were inconclusive, but Dickinson's daughter believes the real problem was depression, a family problem that had led to the death of his older brother, Burgess, in 1913  and was perhaps exacerbated by his still-unresolved struggle with Woodland Scene, on which he had at that time spent five and a half years. When Dickinson's brother Burgess jumped to his death, his eldest brother Howard told the press that Burgess often became depressed when he felt that his work hadn't achieved the level of excellence he set for himself,  and Dickinson, who called his brother \"the chief influence in my entire life\", may well have felt the same way. Indeed, his reported comments about Stranded Brig, probably in the fall or winter of 1932,  before it was reworked for the PWAP, indicate the pressure he felt to do justice not only to this picture but to the unfinished Woodland Scene, which was becoming more difficult to finish than he had expected.  According to Provincetown painter Bruce McKain, Dickinson had shown him the picture of boats in ice, told him that it was not finished and he wouldn't finish it without doing \"justice to the way it should be.

After an initial objection, Secretary Le\u02bbiato gave his support and was appointed Chairman of the Territorial Parks and Recreation Committee. The first field meeting for a parkland acquisition was held between Judge Morrow on behalf of the government and the village council of Vatia to make the Pola Island area a public park. The dredge Palolo was hired from Upolu in January 1966 in order to dredge sand for Utulei Beach. A specialist in beach developments, Ala Varone of the Army, directed the project. The centerpiece of the park was to be at the head of Pago Pago Harbor, where it proposed a 13-acre site created by the dredge.

The purpose of the bill was to protect the ancient paleotropical rainforests and the Flying fox megabat. The signing marked the beginning of American Samoa's entry into the U.S. National Park System. In July 1987, the National Park Service began establishing a federal park, the National Park of American Samoa. An initial appropriation of $400,000 was made in 1989.

They point out that the term appeared in print in Time magazine in 1972, in an article called The Great Wild Californicated West, while show producer Tom Kapinos cites the inspiration as coming from a bumper sticker he saw in the '70s that read Don't Californicate Oregon. Canadian art-rock band the Rheostatics released an album called Whale Music in 1992, with a song called \"California Dreamline\". In this song, the word Californication appears in the phrase \"Californication, spooning in the dry sand\".\nKim Walker, head of intellectual property at Pinsent Masons, states that the band should have registered Californication as a trademark. Instead, the only application for such was filed in April 2007 in the US, by Showtime. The mark has not yet been registered.

The Chili Peppers could almost certainly have registered a trademark for 'Californication', notwithstanding Time's article. They made the word famous, but it doesn't automatically follow that they can stop its use in a TV show.If they had registered the title as a trademark covering entertainment services, I very much doubt we'd have seen a lawsuit.

The reason behind the character's creation had to do with the success of The Incredible Hulk (1977\u20131982) and The Bionic Woman television series, both from Universal Television. Marvel was afraid that the show's executives might suddenly introduce a female version of the Hulk, as producer Kenneth Johnson had already done with The Six Million Dollar Man. So Marvel decided to publish their own version of such a character to make sure that if a similar one showed up in the television series, Marvel would own the rights. Kenneth Johnson later said the plans for season five of The Incredible Hulk was to have Banner's sister suffering from a disease where only the blood of a sibling could save her life, which would turn her into a \"woman Hulk who was crazy and scary and dangerous\". But six episodes into the season, a new boss at CBS decided to cancel the show with immediate effect, ending the last season with episode seven.All but the first issue of The Savage She-Hulk were written by David Anthony Kraft and penciled by Mike Vosburg, and most issues were inked by Frank Springer. Vosburg later remarked, \"The oddest thing about that book was that Frank drew really beautiful women, I drew really beautiful women, and yet, the She-Hulk was never overly attractive.\" The Savage She-Hulk series lasted until 1982, where it ended with #25 (March 1982). She-Hulk then made guest appearances in other characters' books. Her earliest guest-starring adventures followed no specific story line, besides her recurring bad luck with automobiles. She-Hulk also appeared in the limited series, Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions (June to August 1982), in which numerous superheroes are kidnapped from Earth to fight in space.\nShe-Hulk becomes a member of the Avengers in Avengers #221 (July 1982). Her early Avengers appearances continued the running gag about her car troubles. She-Hulk also made occasional guest appearances in The Incredible Hulk. Her appearance in The Avengers #233 (July 1983) was drawn by John Byrne, who would later become strongly associated with the character. \nAt the conclusion of the first Secret Wars miniseries, She-Hulk joins the Fantastic Four (Fantastic Four #265 (April 1984)). During She-Hulk's tenure with the Fantastic Four, she appeared in Marvel Graphic Novel #16: The Aladdin Effect, Marvel Graphic Novel No. 17: Revenge of the Living Monolith, and Marvel Graphic Novel #18: The Sensational She-Hulk. All three graphic novels appeared in 1985. The last, #18, appearing in November 1985, was written and illustrated by then-Fantastic Four writer/artist John Byrne.\nShe-Hulk regained a solo series in 1989, The Sensational She-Hulk (maintaining the 1985 graphic novel's title). The Sensational She-Hulk ran for 60 issues. Issues #1\u20138, 31\u201346, and 48\u201350 were written and drawn by Byrne. Byrne's She-Hulk stories satirized comic books and introduced She-Hulk's awareness that she is a comic book character. Two issues tested the limits of the Comics Code: #34 makes reference to the 1991 Vanity Fair cover in which actress Demi Moore appeared nude and pregnant (She-Hulk's version has her holding a green beach ball to imitate Moore's pregnancy). In issue #40, She-Hulk is depicted jumping rope (apparently) in the nude, with her breasts and genital area covered by blur lines; the cover of the same issue shows her covering herself with a form sporting the lines \"Approved [...] Comics Code\". Other writers to contribute to this series include Steve Gerber (#10, 11 and 13\u201323), Simon Furman, and Peter David.\nDuring The Sensational She-Hulk, the character continued making numerous guest appearances. In 1990, She-Hulk appeared in the two-issue limited series She-Hulk: Ceremony, adapted from a Dwayne McDuffie pitch for a cancelled She-Hulk romantic comedy ongoing series.The Sensational She-Hulk ran until issue #60 (February 1994), making it the longest-running solo title of any Marvel superheroine up to that point. After the cancellation of She-Hulk's second solo series, she continued making backup, one-shot, and team appearances in Fantastic Force (starting with issue #13 in November 1995), the 1996 miniseries Doc Samson #1\u20134 (January\u2013April 1996), Heroes for Hire #8\u201319 (February 1998 through the series finale in January 1999), and The Avengers. Her next major appearance was in the May 2002 one-shot titled Thing and She-Hulk: The Long Night.\nIn May 2004, She-Hulk was given a new title and launched in a wave of six new Marvel books. Despite favorable critical notices, the new series could not escape the low sales numbers that the titles received from their initial cluster-style launch. Marvel brought the series to a close with #12 and promised a re-launch of the title (as a \"second season\") eight months later. The eight-month gap is alluded to in the body of the story itself.\nWith the original creative team (Dan Slott and Juan Bobillo) from the previous series, the book returned eight months later as promised in October 2005. The third issue was billed as the 100th issue of a She-Hulk comic book, and had story art by numerous artists, including Vosburg. There was no new artwork by Buscema or Byrne, who were represented by reprints of The Sensational She-Hulk #1 and The Savage She-Hulk #1.\nDan Slott's last issue is #21; with 33 issues, Slott has written the most solo issues of She-Hulk. Peter David became the new writer with She-Hulk #22. Marvel Comics announced that She-Hulk #38 (February 2009) would be the final issue of the series. Peter David commented on his blog that sales of the book were hurt due to discrepancies between his book and Jeph Loeb's Hulk series, caused by editorial error:\n\nI didn't even know she WAS going to be in Hulk. Had I known, I probably would have done things differently. As it was, there were thousands of readers who were not saying, \"Gee, they're portraying her wrong in \"Hulk.\" Instead they were saying, \"Why should we care about her hero's journey in her own title when she's obviously gotten over her hostility toward Stark over in Hulk?\nThe mantle of She-Hulk is challenged by Lyra, the daughter of Hulk and Thundra, who is the lead character in All-New Savage She-Hulk, a miniseries written by Fred Van Lente.She-Hulk appeared in FF by Matt Fraction and Mike Allred, which debuted in November 2012.An ongoing She-Hulk series, written by Charles Soule and drawn by Javier Pulido, debuted in 2014. It was revealed in October 2014 that Soule and Pulido's run of She-Hulk, which had the character facing off against Matt Murdock in court, would end with issue 12.Since May 2015, She-Hulk has appeared as one of the main characters in A-Force, an all-female Avengers spin-off being launched by G. Willow Wilson, Marguerite Bennett, and Jorge Molina during Marvel's Secret Wars crossover.She-Hulk starred in the comic titled Hulk beginning December 2016. The series showed how she dealt with the trauma stemming from her cousin's death, and the injuries sustained at the hands of Thanos, as fallout from the Civil War II event. She appeared colored grey, similar to Hulk's \"Joe Fixit\" persona, and there were great differences in tone from her previous lighthearted adventures. The title was cancelled with issue #163 in March 2018.In 2022, She-Hulk returned as an ongoing series by writer Rainbow Rowell and artist Rog\u00ea Ant\u00f4nio.

Perhaps more crucial from a cultural perspective, Rambo is a word that can be found in the prestigious Oxford English Dictionary. According to this source, Rambo is \"a Vietnam War veteran represented as macho, self-sufficient and bent on violent retribution.\" As well, it is widely popular to use adjectives such as Ramboesque, Ramboid, or Ramboism, to denote an ideological position that resembles Rambo's attitude and behavior.\nIn the legal profession, a \"Rambo lawyer\" is one who habitually engages in \"all manners of adversarial excess, including personal attacks on other lawyers, hostility, boorish and insulting behavior, rudeness and obstructionist conduct\" or embraces \"a 'take no prisoners' attitude\".Rambo has become the quintessential representation of America during the Reagan years. President Ronald Reagan referred to Rambo in public speeches to exemplify his political ideology and aggressive foreign policy. Towards the end of the 1985 Beirut hostage crisis, President Reagan stated at a press conference that: \"Boy, after seeing Rambo: First Blood Part II last night, I know what to do next time this happens.\"  Reagan often referred to Rambo: First Blood Part II as a model for his domestic and foreign policies. For instance, in his 1985 Labor Day speech, Reagan stated that he would clean the federal tax system \"in the spirit of Rambo\".The Rambo film series also introduced and popularized the concept of the One Man Army in films, in which a protagonist is a well-trained individual who can defeat countless enemies by himself.  Rambo's weapons also became part of American pop culture. Weapons such as the M60 machine gun and the bow became synonymous with the character.

Caravaggio scholar John Gash, however, identifies the flowers as \"definitely jasmine\", symbol of erotic love, and therefore more suitable to a courtesan than to a respectable married woman. The portrait belonged to Caravaggio's patron, Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and the 1638 inventory of the Giustiniani collection lists a \"portrait of a courtesan named Fillide\", identified by modern scholars as Fillide Melandroni. But the commissioner was Fillide's client nobleman Giulio Strozzi to whom she bequeathed the painting in her will of October 8th 1614.\nIn 2017, Tasmanian artist, Johannes Verhoeff, was given the task to create 2 versions of the \u2018Portrait of a Courtesan\u2019 at MONA (Museum of Old and New, Hobart Tasmania). This was part of an experiment to determine if a theory put forward by Caravaggio expert, Dr. Roberta Lupucci of Florence, Italy, could be true. Lapucci proposed that the original painting was made with the help of a number of optical devises which caused a facial distortion claimed to be quite noticeable in the portrait. Verhoeff was tasked to make one recreation with the original distortion, whereas the second painting was created to represent Fillide as she could have looked without the optical distortion. Both paintings now belong to MONA.\nFillide figured prominently in Caravaggio's work in the closing years of the 1590s, appearing as Saint Catherine, as Mary in Martha and Mary Magdalene, and as Judith in Judith Beheading Holofernes. She may have appeared even more frequently - a considerable number of Caravaggio's works are now lost - but she seems to vanish from his paintings after 1599. If sophisticated patrons such as Giustiniani represented one pole of Caravaggio's life, the world of Fillide was the other. She was one of Rome's most successful prostitutes, much sought after by the Roman elite; but she had her true existence in the streets. In February 1599 she was arrested together with a young man named Ranuccio Tomassoni, who seems to have been her pimp, (he came from a good family but was continually turning up in police records in the company of prostitutes, and not as a customer), and charged with creating a disturbance in connection with a noisy mardi gras party in her house. Fillide's friends included another prostitute, Anna Bianchini, who modelled for Caravaggio as Mary Magdalene in his Penitent Magdalene, as Martha (opposite Fillide) in Martha and Mary Magdalene, and as the Mother of Christ in Rest on the Flight into Egypt. Tomassoni would also appear again, but not in paintings: in 1606 Caravaggio killed Tomassoni in an attempt to castrate him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The painting depicts a young woman standing inside a shop selling ribbons and dresses. In one hand she holds a wrapped package of newly purchased items. With the other she holds open the door to the store for the viewer to depart. The shop is filled with piles of ribbons. Outside, a busy Parisian street scene is visible through the shop windows. A well dressed man stares in through the window and is greeted by the other girl in the shop.\nThe painting was created in the period 1883\u20131885 using Tissot's distinctive style of dry pigments and small brush strokes\u2014not impressionism, but still a major departure from the Academy style. It also reflects some of Tissot's main interests, such as the materialistic world of objects and clothing of the late nineteenth century. The painting also employs Tissot's favourite technique of this period of placing the observer directly in the painting, with the shop girl holding the door open for us. It was first exhibited in 1885 at the Galerie Sedelmeyer. It was a part of an exhibit Tissot titled Quinze tableau sur la femme \u00e0 Paris (fifteen paintings on the woman of Paris). It was his last major exhibition before Tissot embraced religious subjects and spent the rest of his life painting scenes from the Bible. The painting was gifted to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1968.Regina Haggo sees this painting as a depiction of barely contained lust.  On the floor a fallen ribbon makes a clear heart shape. To Haggo the position of the heart on the floor makes clear this is a baser form of desire. The women are modestly clothed, but Tissot emphasizes their figures, especially the breasts of the woman raising her arms. In this period a woman working outside the home was considered morally dubious. The leering man and the vantage of the viewer can suggest that more than just the clothing is for sale. The man outside may be flirting with the shop girl, but Haggo notes that Tissot emasculated him by having a women's torso overlap his own.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

She is sometimes counted as an empress regnant, who actually ruled in her own right, rather than just a regent. Theodora is most famous for bringing an end to the second Byzantine Iconoclasm (814\u2013843), an act for which she is recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Though her reign saw the loss of most of Sicily and failure to retake Crete, Theodora's foreign policy was otherwise highly successful; by 856, the Byzantine Empire had gained the upper hand over both the Bulgarian Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate, and the Slavic tribes in the Peloponnese had been forced to pay tribute, all without decreasing the imperial gold reserve.\nPossibly of Armenian descent, Theodora was born into a rural family of traders and military officials in Paphlagonia. In 830 she was selected by Euphrosyne, step-mother of the emperor Theophilos, for a bride-show for the young emperor. After being chosen by Theophilos she was crowned empress on 5 June 830. Theophilos was an iconoclast, who opposed the veneration of icons; it is unclear how aware he was that Theodora was an iconophile. Though she loyally participated in imperial affairs and ceremonies, and bore Theophilos seven children, Theodora continued to secretly venerate icons throughout her husband's reign. Theophilos died of dysentery on 20 January 842, probably younger than 30. On his deathbed, he named Theodora as regent for their two-year-old son Michael III and designated a selection of advisors to assist her. The most prominent of these advisors was the logothete and eunuch Theoktistos, who would become a close confidant of Theodora.\nTheodora proved to be fully capable of governing the empire. Though only in her late twenties, she led well and inspired loyalty, was surrounded by experienced officials, and had no obvious rivals. The reintroduction of icon veneration was made without much issue, though the Paulician heretics in eastern Anatolia were ruthlessly suppressed on Theodora's orders. Without the need of much military action, she managed to safeguard the empire from attacks by the Bulgarian rulers Presian and Boris I through diplomacy. The Byzantine sack of the city of Anazarbus in Cilicia largely ended the Arab threat for the near future. As Michael III grew older, he feared that Theodora meant to follow in the footsteps of Empress Irene and depose him in order to rule alone. Angered by Theodora's refusal to allow him to choose his own wife, Michael recalled her brother Bardas from exile, and with him assassinated Theoktistos in November 855. Theodora was enraged at Michael and the other conspirators for several months, before Michael, who was unable to placate his mother, deposed her on 15 March 856 and became sole emperor. Theodora continued to live in the imperial palace until 857 or 858, when she was expelled and confined to a convent in Gastria alongside some of her daughters. She may have been released from the convent around 863 and allowed to take some form of ceremonial role. She died shortly after Michael III was murdered by his friend and co-emperor, Basil I.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Ely's philosophy and radical practice came under fire from state education superintendent Oliver Elwin Wells. Ely was known to be liberal and pro-union, having published a book on socialism. Wells protested Ely's socialist beliefs, teaching, and public speaking to UW president Charles Kendall Adams and the Board of Regents, who did not censure Ely. A committee appointed to address the charges produced a report that exonerated Ely upon acceptance by the regents. The report introduced the idea of \"sifting and winnowing\":\nAs Regents of a university with over a hundred instructors supported by nearly two millions of people who hold a vast diversity of views regarding the great questions which at present agitate the human mind, we could not for a moment think of recommending the dismissal or even the criticism of a teacher even if some of his opinions should, in some quarters, be regarded as visionary. Such a course would be equivalent to saying that no professor should teach anything which is not accepted by everybody as true. This would cut our curriculum down to very small proportions. We cannot for a moment believe that knowledge has reached its final goal, or that the present condition of society is perfect. We must therefore welcome from our teachers such discussions as shall suggest the means and prepare the way by which knowledge may be extended, present evils be removed and others prevented. We feel that we would be unworthy of the position we hold if we did not believe in progress in all departments of knowledge. In all lines of academic investigation it is of the utmost importance that the investigator should be absolutely free to follow the indications of truth wherever they may lead. Whatever may be the limitations which trammel inquiry elsewhere we believe the great state University of Wisconsin should ever encourage that continual and fearless sifting and winnowing by which alone the truth can be found.\nEly later referred to the report as the \"Wisconsin Magna Charta\" for its guarantees of academic freedom in pursuit of truth. In Decades of Chaos and Revolution, Stephen J. Nelson contends that UW's sentiment on academic freedom had been set \"well before\" the 1890s. He added that the 1894 statement \"sounds the trumpet of the fundamental principles of the academy: an unending, unlimited belief in the creed of academic freedom and inquiry.\" Ely's hearing was later dramatized in a 1964 television episode of Profiles in Courage, featuring actors Dan O'Herlihy, Edward Asner, and Leonard Nimoy.The \"sifting and winnowing\" construction was coined by Adams, the UW president, who had defended Ely publicly and read his book. It was later invoked by UW\u2013Madison Chancellor Robben Wright Fleming when responding to protestors during his tenure.In a later incident, sociology professor Edward Alsworth Ross was censured upon inviting anarchist Emma Goldman to address his class. He did not share her beliefs, but supported her free speech. In memorial of the incident, the Class of 1910 created a commemorative \"sifting and winnowing\" plaque of the phrase in its context, which the regents rejected. After the Class appealed to area newspapers, the regents relented. The plaque was installed on Bascom Hall in 1915, where it remains. It was rededicated in 1957.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Donnithorne was widely considered at the time to be Dickens' model for Miss Havisham, although this cannot be proven.Another contemporary inspiration might have been Margaret Catherine Dick of Bonchurch, Isle of Wight, who lived at  \"Uppermount\" house and was the daughter of Captain Samuel Dick. Dickens spent the summer of 1849 staying in Bonchurch writing chapters of David Copperfield; during his time in the coastal village he took regular walks up St Boniface Down with Charles George Dick, the brother of Margaret. The character of Mr Dick (who boarded with Miss Betsy Trotwood) in David Copperfield is based on Charles. In 1860 Margaret Dick was jilted at the altar and began living a reclusive life. In the 1860s, Dickens' daughters stayed with the vicar in Bonchurch that was to marry Margaret Dick. Dickens may have based the character of Miss Havisham on Margaret Dick; but named her after her neighbour Miss Haviland.In the introduction to the 1965 Penguin edition of Great Expectations, writer Angus Calder notes that \"James Payn, a minor novelist, claimed to have given Dickens the idea for Miss Havisham \u2013 from a living original of his acquaintance. He declared that Dickens's account was 'not one whit exaggerated'.\" Dickens reportedly encountered a wealthy recluse called Elizabeth Parker while staying in Newport, Shropshire, which has an aptly named Havisham Court. However, research by the Newport History Society has found no evidence to support the stories that Dickens ever stayed in Newport, met Miss Parker, or was an inspiration for Miss Havisham. Despite the reports Miss Parker (born 1802) spent the rest of her life as a recluse, census records of the period show she was at Chester (1851), then Whitchurch (1861), before moving to Chetwynd House, Newport in 1863. She was not even living in Newport when Dickens started to write Great Expectations in 1859.Since the publication of Great Expectations, the character of Miss Havisham has seen numerous comparisons and parallels with many real jilted brides (life imitating art), such as the widely-reported case of Alice Pinard-D\u00f4ges in Neuilly, France who committed suicide in her bridal gown in 1894.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The series debuted on BBC1 in 1985, the same year that the BBC launched its first ongoing soap opera EastEnders as a challenge to the ratings supremacy of ITV's Coronation Street. The first series, which aired in 1985, was a slow burner. It wasn't until the BBC repeated it in the summer of 1986 as the lead-in to the second series that Howards' Way became a huge hit. Its scheduling with new comedy series Bread, which launched in 1986, and followed it on a Sunday evening, saw both programmes achieve huge viewing figures for the BBC. Although Howards' Way is commonly cited as an attempt to provide a British alternative to glossy American sagas such as Dallas and Dynasty, it also acts as a continuation of plot themes explored in a previous Glaister series, The Brothers, which involved a family's personal and professional crises running a road haulage firm, and embraced several soap opera touches in its characterisations and storylines.The original working title for the series was \"The Boatbuilders\", which was ultimately rejected when it was felt that it sounded like a documentary series and wouldn't grab viewers' attention.\nThe theme music was composed by Simon May and performed by his orchestra. Executive Leslie Osborne secured a co-writer credit, but in reality did not contribute to the composition. After series one, Don Black was commissioned to write lyrics for the theme; May had suggested the title \"Almost There\", which Black changed to \"Always There\". The song was recorded by Marti Webb, and reached number 13 in the UK singles chart. The upbeat variation of the theme, \"Barracuda\", was used over the show's end credits from series 3 (until the show's ended), and was a \"re-visitation\" of a section of May's song \"Believe\" for his musical Smike.Inspired by a storyline in Howards' Way, Gerard Glaister went on to create Trainer (1991\u20131992), set in the world of horse-racing, and also featuring several of the same cast members.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the museum's planetarium, visitors view a presentation written by AiG's staff astrophysicist that presents creationist cosmologies as alternatives to the Big Bang theory of the origins of the Universe. The planetarium underwent a $1.2 million renovation in 2020 while the museum was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the renovations expanded the planetarium's capacity, upgraded its display equipment, and improved its acoustics. In the 200-seat theater\u2014which features special effects such as seats that vibrate and jets that spray the audience with mist\u2014a film depicts two angelic beings who proclaim, \"God loves science!\" The museum also includes a restaurant and a medieval-themed gift shop. Outside the main structure are walking trails and a 5-acre (0.020 km2) lake.\nPatrick Marsh, who designed the Jaws and King Kong attractions at Universal Studios Florida, led the design of the exhibits for the Creation Museum. Kurt Wise was hired as scientific consultant and also played a major role in designing the exhibits, including the 52 professionally made videos. In 2009, AiG added an exhibit about natural selection, featuring models of finches, which Charles Darwin observed before proposing the theory of evolution in 1859. A 2013 expansion project added a lobby display suggesting that ancient stories of monsters and dragons may have been accounts of human encounters with dinosaurs. An animatronic character depicting a science professor in a research lab, dubbed \"Dr. Crawley\", tells visitors that, due to the variation and complexity of bug species, they could not have evolved naturally but must have been created by God.\nDinosaurs are prominently featured in many areas of the museum. Prior to the museum's opening, Ham stated, \"We're putting evolutionists on notice: We're taking the dinosaurs back... They're used to teach people that there's no God, and they're used to brainwash people. Evolutionists get very upset when we use dinosaurs.\" While some of the museum's dinosaur models are animatronic, many were sculpted from fiberglass by a taxidermist. Near the museum's lobby, a diorama depicts two ancient-age children playing near a stream, unmolested by nearby dinosaurs.Since 2014, the museum has displayed the skeleton of a 30 feet (9.1 m) long, 10 feet (3.0 m) wide Allosaurus fragilis dubbed \"Ebenezer\". Over half of the skeleton, including a nearly-complete 3 feet (0.91 m) long skull with 53 teeth, was recovered from the northern Colorado portion of Morrison Formation. The Elizabeth Streb Peroutka Foundation of Pasadena, Maryland, purchased the skeleton and donated it to the museum, and AiG paid an anonymous expert based in Utah to restore it before displaying it. The skeleton is presented as evidence of Noah's Flood. In 2021, Brian William Delafayette was indicted for making a bomb threat after posting on an AiG-affiliated web page that a bomb had been planted under the Allosaurus display at the museum; no bomb was found at the site.The museum is also critical of evolutionary theory that links dinosaurs with bird evolution. The second room of the Creation Museum, for example, displays a model prehistoric Utahraptor, stating that the species was featherless and had no connection to birds, referring to Genesis 1, which states that birds were created before the advent of land animals.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The band performed to an audience of more than 100,000 people and was soon added to the \"Monsters of Rock\" European tour, but dropped out after the first show due to bassist David Ellefson's drug problems. Further issues within the band caused frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine to fire drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, and cancel their scheduled 1988 Australian tour. Nick Menza, previously Behler's drum tech, was hired as the band's new drummer. The search for a new guitarist was a drawn out process; Mustaine examined a number of guitarists for the job, including Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, who was initially offered the job before declining, as he requested that his Pantera brother, drummer Vinnie Paul, also be hired. Jeff Waters of Annihilator was also considered. Mustaine had asked original Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland to rejoin the band, with Poland tracking lead guitar parts on demo versions of all the songs that ended up on the studio album. According to Poland, he was \"99 percent going to join\" the band but was talked out of it by his manager. According to Mustaine, one of the last guitarists he had heard about, Marty Friedman, had sent him a copy of Dragon's Kiss, on which Friedman played. Upon listening to the record, Mustaine had Friedman come in to audition and hired him. This would become the band's first stable line-up and, as recognized by fans, the 'classic' Megadeth lineup.The album title Rust in Peace was inspired by a bumper sticker that Mustaine saw on the back of a vehicle while driving home from Lake Elsinore, California. The sticker read: \"May all your nuclear weapons rust in peace\". Mustaine liked the concept and decided to use it as a title for Megadeth's upcoming album. Rust in Peace was recorded at Rumbo Recorders with producer Mike Clink, while the mixing was handled by Max Norman. Clink was brought in for his work on both Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction and UFO's Strangers in the Night. The producer's work dealt mostly with the bass, drums and Friedman's guitar. In a 2002 interview, Mustaine declared that they \"really didn't make the record with [Clink]\" as at the time he was focused on Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and II \u2013 which were also being recorded at Rumbo \u2013 and stated most of the work in the album was done by himself, Norman, and engineer Micajah Ryan.The album artwork was created by artist Ed Repka, who previously had done the cover for Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? in 1986. It references \"Hangar 18\", and depicts band mascot Vic Rattlehead and world leaders of the era viewing an alien body. In addition to creating the album's cover, Repka also supplied artwork for the album's two singles. The object Rattlehead is holding was confirmed by Mustaine to be a material resembling Kryptonite.The men featured on the cover are, from left to right: an unidentified British representative, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, German President Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and United States President George H.

Additionally levels were changed to an exclusively grade-based system, A new level, Girl Scout Ambassadors, was created for girls in grades 11 and 12. Sixth grade girls were reclassified from Junior level to Cadette level in order to conform with the broad reclassification of 6th grade as a middle school grade. The new levels were tested in approximately six councils during the spring of 2008, and were instituted nationally after October 1, 2008.\nAlthough troop membership is the most common way to participate in Girl Scouting, girls who do not have a local troop, or those who are unable or unwilling to participate in their local troop, can still sign up as individual Girl Scouts. Individual Girls Scouts were known in the early years of Girl Scouting as Lone Scouts and later as Juliettes; they attend activities independently and work individually on badges and awards. In 2001, Stefanie Argus, an eighth-grade student, created Juliettes, an official designation for independent Girls Scouts, as her Silver Award Project. \"I wanted to create something to tell other girls who left their troops they belong to the Girl Scouts,\" Argus said.

Uniquely, the \"Random\" board\u2014also known as /b/\u2014enforces no particular rules.4chan is the Internet's most trafficked imageboard, according to the Los Angeles Times. 4chan's Alexa rank was 853 on March 2022, though it has been as high as 56. It is provided to its users free of charge and consumes a large amount of bandwidth; as a result, its financing has often been problematic. Poole has acknowledged that donations alone could not keep the site online, and turned to advertising to help make ends meet. However, the explicit content hosted on 4chan has deterred businesses who do not want to be associated with the site's content. In January 2009, Poole signed a new deal with an advertising company; in February 2009, he was $20,000 in debt, and the site was continuing to lose money. The 4chan servers were moved from Texas to California in August 2008, which upgraded the maximum bandwidth throughput of 4chan from 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s.Unlike most web forums, 4chan does not have a registration system, allowing users to post anonymously. Posting is ephemeral, as threads receiving recent replies are \"bumped\" to the top of their respective board and old threads are deleted as new ones are created. Any nickname may be used when posting, even one that has been previously adopted, such as \"Anonymous\" or \"moot\". In place of registration, 4chan has provided tripcodes as an optional form of authenticating a poster's identity. As making a post without filling in the \"Name\" field causes posts to be attributed to \"Anonymous\", general understanding on 4chan holds that Anonymous is not a single person but a collective (hive) of users. Moderators generally post without a name even when performing sysop actions. A \"capcode\" may be used to attribute the post to \"Anonymous ## Mod\", although moderators often post without the capcode. In a 2011 interview on Nico Nico Douga, Poole explained that there are approximately 20 volunteer moderators active on 4chan. 4chan also has a junior moderation team, called \"janitors\", who may delete posts or images and suggest that the normal moderation team ban a user, but who cannot post with a capcode. Revealing oneself as a janitor is grounds for immediate dismissal.4chan has been the target of occasional denial of service attacks.

{"id": "170_327", "question": "Who was A Ceremony of Carols created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "26_48285", "text": "For most of the interwar period, Romania was in the French sphere of influence, and in June 1926 a defensive alliance was signed with France. The alliance with France together with an alliance with Poland signed in 1921, and the \"Little Entente\" which united Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia \u2013 were the cornerstones of Romanian foreign policy. Starting in 1919, the French sought to create the Cordon sanitaire that would keep both Germany and the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe. Carol did not seek to replace the foreign policy he had inherited in 1930 at first, as he regarded the continuation of the cordon sanitaire as the best guarantee of Romania's independence and territorial integrity, and as such, his foreign policy was essentially pro-French. At the time that Romania signed the alliance with France, the Rhineland region of Germany was demilitarized and the thinking in Bucharest had always been that if Germany should commit any act of aggression anywhere in Eastern Europe, the French would begin an offensive into the Reich. Starting in 1930 when the French began to build the Maginot Line along their border with Germany, some doubts started to be expressed in Bucharest about whether the French might actually come to Romania's aid in the event of a German aggression. In 1933, Carol had Nicolae Titulescu \u2013 an outspoken champion of collective security under the banner of League of Nations \u2013 appointed foreign minister with instructions to use principles of collective security as the building blocks for creating some sort of security structure, intended to keep both Germany and the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe. Carol and Titulescu personally disliked one another, but Carol wanted Titulescu as a foreign minister as he believed he was the best man for strengthening ties with France and for bringing Great Britain into the affairs of Eastern Europe, under the guise of the collective security commitments contained the League Covenant.The process of Gleichschaltung (coordination) in National Socialist Germany did not extend only to the Reich but was rather thought of by the National Socialist leadership as a worldwide process in which the NSDAP would take control over all of the ethnic German communities around the entire world. The Foreign Policy Department of the NSDAP headed by Alfred Rosenberg starting in 1934 had attempted to take over the Volk Deutsch (ethnic German) community in Romania, a policy that greatly offended Carol, who regarded this as an outrageous German interference in Romania's internal affairs. As Romania had half-million Volk Deutsch citizens in the 1930s, the Nazi campaign to take over the German community in Romania was a real concern for Carol, who feared that the German minority might become a fifth column. In addition, Rosenberg's agents had established contracts with the Romanian extreme right, most notably with the National Christian Party headed by Octavian Goga and less substantial links with the Iron Guard headed by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, which further annoyed Carol. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote about Carol's foreign policy views that \"He admired and feared Germany, but feared and disliked the Soviet Union\". The fact that the first leader to visit Nazi Germany (albeit not in an official capacity) was the Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s \u2013 who during his visit to Berlin in October 1933 signed an economic treaty that placed Hungary within the German economic sphere of influence \u2013 was a source of much alarm to Carol. For the entire interwar period, Budapest refused to recognize the frontiers imposed by the Treaty of Trianon and laid claim to Transylvania region of Romania. Carol, like the rest of the Romanian elite, was worried by the prospect of an alliance of the revisionist states that rejected the legitimacy of the international order created by the Allies in 1918\u201320, indicating that Germany would support Hungary's claims to Transylvania. Hungary had territorial disputes with Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, all of which happened to be allies of France. Accordingly, Franco\u2013Hungarian relations were extremely bad during the interwar period, and so \u2013 it seemed natural that Hungary would ally itself with France's archenemy, Germany.\nIn 1934, Titulescu played a leading role in creating the Balkan Entente which brought together Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey in an alliance intended to counter Bulgarian revanchism. The Balkan Entente was intended to be the beginning of an alliance that would bring together all of the anti\u2013revisionist states of Eastern Europe. Like France, Romania was allied to both Czechoslovakia and Poland, but because of the Teschen dispute in Silesia, Warsaw and Prague were bitter enemies. Like the diplomats of the Quai d'Orsay, Carol was exasperated by the bitter Polish\u2013Czechoslovak dispute, arguing that it was absurd for anti-revisionist Eastern European states to be feuding with one another in the face of the rise of German and Soviet powers. Several times, Carol attempted to mediate the Teschen dispute and thus end the Polish\u2013Czechoslovak feud without much success. Reflecting his initially pro-French orientation, in June 1934, when the French foreign minister Louis Barthou visited Bucharest to meet with the foreign ministers of \"the Little Entente\" of Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, Carol organized lavish celebrations to welcome Barthou, that were made to symbolize the enduring Franco\u2013Romanian friendship between the two \"Latin sisters\". The German minister to Romania, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg complained with disgust in a report to Berlin that everyone in the Romanian elite was an incurable Francophile who told him that Romania would never betray its \"Latin sister\" France.\nAt the same time, Carol also considered the possibility that if Romanian\u2013German relations were improved, then perhaps Berlin could be persuaded not to support Budapest in its campaign to regain Transylvania. Further pressing Carol towards Germany was the desperate state of the Romanian economy: even before the worldwide Great Depression, Romania had been a poor country, and the Great Depression hit Romania hard, with Romanians been unable to export much owing to the global trade war set off by the American Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which in turn led to a decline in the value of the Leu as Romanian's reserves of foreign exchange were being used up. In June 1934, the Romanian finance minister Victor Sl\u0103vescu visited Paris to ask the French to inject millions of francs into the Romanian treasury and to lower their tariffs on Romanian goods. When the French refused both requests, an annoyed Carol wrote in his diary that the \"Latin sister\" France was behaving in a less than sisterly way towards Romania. In April 1936, when Wilhelm Fabricius was appointed German minister in Bucharest, the Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath in his instructions to the new minister described Romania as an unfriendly, pro-French state, but suggested that the prospect of more trade with the Reich might bring the Romanians out of the French orbit. Neurath further instructed Fabricius that while Romania was not a major power in a military sense, it was a state of crucial importance to Germany because of its oil.\nCarol often encouraged splits in the political parties, to encourage his own ends. In 1935, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, the leader of the Transylvanian branch of the National Peasants broke away, to form the Romanian Front with Carol's encouragement. During the same time, Carol developed close contacts with Armand C\u0103linescu, an ambitious National Peasant leader who founded a faction opposed to the leadership of Carol's archenemy Iuliu Maniu, and wanted the National Peasants to work with the Crown. In the same way, Carol encouraged the \"Young Liberal\" faction headed by Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu as a way of weakening the power of the Br\u0103tianu family who dominated the National Liberals. Pointedly, Carol was willing to allow the \"Young Liberal\" faction under T\u0103t\u0103rescu to come to power, but excluded the main National Liberal faction under the leadership of Dinu Br\u0103tianu from obtaining power; Carol had not forgotten how the Br\u0103tianus had excluded him from the succession in the 1920s.In February 1935, the Legion's leader, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, who until then had been regarded as an ally of Carol, for the first time attacked the king directly, when he organized demonstrations outside of the royal palace attacking Carol after Dr. Dimitrie Gerota had been imprisoned for writing an article exposing the corrupt business dealings of Lupescu. Codreanu in his speech before the Royal Palace called Lupescu a \"Jewish whore\" who was robbing Romania blind, which led to an insulted Carol calling on one of the members of his camarilla, the Bucharest police prefect Gavril\u0103 Marinescu, who sent the police out to break up the Iron Guard rally with much violence.The doubts about the French willingness to undertake an offensive against Germany were further reinforced by the Remilitarization of the Rhineland in March 1936, which had the effect of allowing the Germans to start building the Siegfried line along the border with France, something that considerably lessened the prospect of a French offensive into western Germany if the Reich should invade any of the states of the cordon sanitaire. A British Foreign Office memo from March 1936 stated that the only nations in the world that would apply sanctions on Germany for remilitarizing the Rhineland if the League of Nations should vote for such a step were Britain, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Romania. In the aftermath of the remilitarization of the Rhineland, and once it was clear that no sanctions were going to be applied against Germany, Carol started to voice his fears that the days of French influence in Eastern Europe were numbered and Romania might have to seek some understanding with Germany to preserve its independence. With continuing the alliance with France, after March 1936 Carol also began a policy of attempting to improve relations with Germany.On the domestic front, in the summer of 1936 Codreanu and Maniu formed an alliance to oppose the growing power of the Crown and the National Liberal government. In August 1936, Carol had Titulescu fired as foreign minister and in November 1936, Carol sent the renegade National Liberal politician Gheorghe I. Br\u0103tianu to Germany to meet with Adolf Hitler, the Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath and Hermann G\u00f6ring, to tell them of Romania's desire for a rapprochement with the Reich. Carol was much relieved when Br\u0103tianu reported that Hitler, Neurath and G\u00f6ring had all reassured him that the Reich had no interest in supporting Hungarian revanchism, and were neutral on the Transylvania dispute. The decoupling of Berlin's campaign to overthrow the international system created by the Treaty of Versailles, from Budapest's campaign to overthrow the system created by the Treaty of Trianon, was welcome news to Carol, creating the possibility that a greater Germany would not mean a greater Hungary. G\u00f6ring, the newly appointed chief of the Four Year Plan organization designed to have Germany ready to wage a total war by 1940 was especially interested in Romania's oil and talked much to Br\u0103tianu about a new era of German\u2013Romanian economic relations. Germany had almost no oil of its own, and throughout the Third Reich control of Romania's oil was a key foreign policy goal. Reflecting the changed emphasis, Carol vetoed in February 1937 a plan promoted by France and Czechoslovakia for a new alliance that would formally unite France with the Little Entente and envisioned much closer military ties between the French and their allies in Eastern Europe. Because of its oil, the French were keen to keep the alliance with Romania strong, and because Romania's manpower was a way of compensating the French for their lower population vs. Germany's (the French had 40 million people while Germany had 70 million people). Additionally, it was assumed in Paris that if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia Hungary would also attack Czechoslovakia to regain Slovakia and Ruthenia. French military planners envisioned the role of Romania and Yugoslavia in such a war as invading Hungary to relieve the pressure on Czechoslovakia.\nUp until 1940, Carol's foreign policy teetered uneasily between the traditional alliance with France and an alignment with the newly ascending power of Germany. In the summer of 1937, Carol told French diplomats that if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia, he would not allow the Red Army transit rights across Romania, but was willing to ignore the Soviets if they crossed Romanian airspace on their way to Czechoslovakia. On 9 December 1937, a German\u2013Romanian economic treaty was signed that placed Romania within the German economic sphere of influence, but which left the Germans unsatisfied as the Reich's enormous demand for oil, to power its increasingly large war machine, was not yet fulfilled by the 1937 treaty. Germany had a tremendous need for oil and no sooner had the 1937 agreement been signed than the Germans asked for a new economic treaty in 1938. At the same time that the German-Romanian treaty was signed in December 1937, Carol was receiving the French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos to show that the alliance with France was not yet dead.", "hasanswer": false}]}

George Alagiah became deputy presenter at the same time until early 2002 when he became the presenter of BBC Four News. Darren Jordon took over from George Alagiah as deputy presenter until late 2006. Following Ford's retirement, Sophie Raworth became lead anchor.\nOn 22 January 2007, the programme titles were relaunched, along with the rest of the BBC television output, to give an identical series of titles across news programming on all BBC channels.\nBetween February and August 2008, Kate Silverton took over as main presenter while Sophie Raworth was on maternity leave. After this Kate Silverton became deputy presenter.\nOn 4 February 2008, the programme temporarily moved studios, from N6 to N8 (the former BBC News 24 studio), as part of restructuring across BBC News. On 21 April 2008 the programme underwent a graphical refresh and returned to the refurbished N6, and was now known as the BBC News at One.\nOn 5 November 2010, during the National Union of Journalists strike action, former Sky News and GMTV presenter Emma Crosby presented the programme whilst the regular presenters were absent. Further strike dates occurred on 15 July 2011 and 1 August 2011 plus on 28 March 2013. Gavin Grey presented on these days in addition to BBC News Channel.On 18 March 2013, the programme moved to Broadcasting House, along with the BBC News channel and the other BBC One bulletins, and began broadcasting in high-definition. The programme was the first to be broadcast from the new studio.Between January and June 2015, the bulletin was extended to 40 minutes due to the length of the English regional bulletins being reduced to 5 minutes during the general election campaign period. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland retained the original 30-minute broadcast length and aired their regular 15-minute bulletins.\nFrom 23 March 2020, Simon McCoy took the role as the Monday-Wednesday presenter, following the end of the BBC's Afternoon Live, Jane Hill continued to present on Thursdays, with her sharing the role on Fridays with Kate Silverton. Raworth ceased to present the bulletin and appeared exclusively as a main anchor of the BBC News at Six and BBC News at Ten.\nOn 25 March 2021, Simon McCoy left the BBC after 17 years at the network. He presented his final BBC News at One on the same day. Since McCoy's departure, the programme has dispensed with a main presenter, with a team of established BBC journalists presenting the programme on rotation.\nOn 14 March 2023, BBC News at One used Studio B at the Broadcasting House for the first time to include a completely new studio and presentation. However, unlike BBC News at Six and BBC News at Ten, Studio E was still in use regularly for the bulletin, until the main launch.\nOn 15 May 2023, two months after the first trial, BBC News at One moved to Studio B permanently to follow the same format as the BBC News at Six and Ten using the new presentation, graphics, titles and the new handover to the nations and regions.\nOn 29 November 2023, it was announced that as part of a series of changes within BBC News, BBC News at One would move from London to MediaCityUK in Salford, and be extended from 30 minutes to one hour, making it the first regular national news bulletin on the BBC to broadcast regularly from outside London.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Prather said, \"The music has never been the question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they're there with you.\" Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: \"All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of.\" He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.\nSeveral of the songs in this album were conceptually based on a situation. For instance, \"Burn\" was built around the winding down of Usher's two-year relationship with Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas from American R&B-Hip hop girl group TLC. Dupri and Cox were talking and felt that there was a song in it, and started writing. Similarly, with the title track \"Confessions Part II\", they were conversing about an impregnated mistress, and its concept was written down. Usher recorded \"Confessions Part II\" during July 2003 recording sessions in New York City. When Usher sang the song's lyrics, the theme of cheating inspired him and Dupri to create two parts; \"Confessions Part I\" and \"Confessions Part II\". \"Confessions Part I\" can be heard at the beginning of the video for \"Confessions Part II\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The consequent eroticism in the sculpture made it controversial. A bronze version of The Kiss (74 centimetres (29 in) high) was sent for display at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

It is Britain's largest piece of public art, and is intended to be a permanent lasting legacy of London's hosting of the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, assisting in the post-Olympics regeneration of the Stratford area. Sited between the Olympic Stadium (now called London Stadium) and the Aquatics Centre, it allows visitors to view the whole Olympic Park from two observation platforms.\nOrbit was designed by Turner-Prize winning artist Anish Kapoor and Cecil Balmond of Arup Group, an engineering firm. Announced on 31 March 2010, it was expected to be completed by December 2011. The project came about after Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell decided in 2008 that the Olympic Park needed \"something extra\". Designers were asked for ideas for an \"Olympic tower\" at least 100 metres (330 ft) high: Orbit was the unanimous choice from proposals considered by a nine-person advisory panel. Kapoor and Balmond believed that Orbit represented a radical advance in the architectural field of combining sculpture and structural engineering, and that it combined both stability and instability in a work that visitors can engage with and experience via an incorporated spiral walkway. It has been both praised and criticised for its bold design, and has especially received criticism as a vanity project of questionable lasting use or merit as a public art project.\nThe project was expected to cost \u00a319.1 million, with \u00a316 million coming from Britain's then-richest man, the steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman of the ArcelorMittal steel company, and the balance of \u00a33.1 million coming from the London Development Agency. The name \"ArcelorMittal Orbit\" combines the name of Mittal's company, as chief sponsor, with Orbit, the original working title for Kapoor and Balmond's design.\nThe ArcelorMittal Orbit temporarily closed after the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games while the South Plaza (in which Orbit is positioned) underwent reconstruction for its long-term legacy use as a public outdoor space. It re-opened to the public on 5 April 2014. The structure incorporates the world's tallest and longest \u2013 178 m (584 ft) \u2013 tunnel slide, designed by Carsten H\u00f6ller. The idea was originally envisioned by the London Legacy Development Corporation as a way to attract more visitors to the tower. The slide includes transparent sections to give a \"different perspective\" of the twisting red tower and was completed in June 2016.

Orion, Himon, and others discover the full extent of the death toll when on screens shows the New Gods who have been killed and others who are still missing. The Forever People are shown to be missing and two of them are prime suspects as Serifan and Beautiful Dreamer are both seen leaving two of the murders. Orion blames Darkseid; Takion asks him to hold off until further information can be revealed. Mister Miracle's wife, Big Barda, is killed in their kitchen while his back is turned. The Justice League comes to investigate Barda's murder. Dr. Mid-Nite performs an autopsy which doesn't reveal how she was killed. Mr. Miracle contemplates using the Anti-Life Equation to bring his wife back, but stops himself. He receives an urgent summons back to New Genesis. Superman and Mr. Miracle bring Barda's body back to New Genesis. Darkseid asks Desaad to investigate these murders by having him examine Justeen, who was also murdered. Superman and Mr. Miracle arrive on New Genesis. Orion is insulted by Superman's presence and attacks him. Metron arrives and reveals what the cause of death is to all the New Gods. Darkseid has also come to the same conclusion: their souls have been taken from them. Darkseid wonders if all his theories on the Anti-Life Equation were actually true.\nWhile searching the Wall for clues, Takion is killed by a mysterious assailant whom he recognizes. Superman, Scott Free and Orion battle Darkseid's shadow demons, and discover that Darkseid has obtained a portion of the Anti-Life Equation, which is still not as strong as Free's full control. Stalemated, Darkseid tells the heroes that he knows what is causing the murders, but that even knowing that he will die, he sees a chance to gain advantage, though he'll still not reveal his plot to the three heroes.\nSuperman, Orion, and Mr. Miracle discover that the Forever People have been murdered as well.

Long ago, the Source was attacked by the Old Gods and split into two, light and dark. The light side recovered and brought about the Death of the Old Gods, and then attempted to recreate existence, but could only manage to make the flawed Fourth World due to its imperfection. It attempted to reunite with its darker part, but was delayed by the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, which unified alternative realities and created an impenetrable Source Wall. The Source then orchestrated the events of Infinite Crisis, apparently subtly manipulating Alexander Luthor, and later the events of 52 to bring back the Multiverse, and freeing its dark half, which had taken the form of the Anti-Life Entity. The Source thus reveals that it is now using an agent to eliminate the Fourth World in order to bring about the Fifth World, which will be perfect. The Source agrees to Metron's request that he be allowed to witness the end of the Fourth World.\nThe reunited Source reveals how Miracle's beliefs were not of its doing. Miracle, feeling manipulated and betrayed by the Source, requests to be killed and he is.

Several figures in the Sistine Chapel frescos appear to be portraits, but the subjects are unknown, although fanciful guesses have been made.

He typically wears a red or blue frock coat, top hat, pince-nez glasses, and spats varying in color. He is portrayed in animation as speaking with a Scottish accent. Originally intended to be used only once, Scrooge became one of the most popular characters in the Disney comics world, as well as Barks' signature work. Scrooge is an extremely rich duck who lives in the fictional city of Duckburg (which is also Donald Duck and Huey, Dewey, and Louie's home city) in the fictional U.S. state of Calisota (a blend of California and Minnesota), whose claimed location is in California in the real-world United States.Named after the character Ebenezer Scrooge from Charles Dickens' 1843 holiday novella A Christmas Carol, Scrooge is an incredibly rich business magnate and self-proclaimed \"adventure-capitalist\", whose dominant character traits are his wealth, frugality, and tendency to seek more money through adventure and treasure hunting. Scrooge founded the company called McDuck Enterprises. He the maternal uncle of Donald Duck and Della Duck, the maternal great uncle of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, a usual financial backer of Gyro Gearloose, and the world's richest person \u2014 all within the context of the fictional Donald Duck universe. He is portrayed as an oil tycoon, businessman, industrialist, and the owner of many factories and the largest mining concerns. Both his \"Money Bin\" and Scrooge himself are often used as humorous metonyms for great wealth in popular culture around the world.\nMcDuck was initially characterized as a greedy miser and antihero (similar to Dickens' original Scrooge character). However, in later appearances, he has often been portrayed as a thrifty hero, adventurer, and explorer. He was originally created by Barks as an antagonist for Donald Duck, first appearing in the 1947 story Christmas on Bear Mountain (Four Color #178). However, McDuck's popularity grew so large that he became a major figure in the Donald Duck universe. In 1952, he received his own comic book series, called Uncle Scrooge, originally published from 1952\u20131984, and has had various revivals over the years (as have other Disney comic lines). The most recent revival, by IDW Publishing, ran from 2015\u20132020.\nScrooge was most famously drawn by his creator Carl Barks, and then later by Don Rosa. Like other Disney franchise characters, Scrooge McDuck's international popularity has resulted in literature that's often translated into other languages.

Birdwood is an amateur private investigator, who spends her time as a freelance journalist for the ABC. Sigrid Thornton was attached to play the role, with the program given a 26-episode order by the Seven Network under the title Murder Calling. Ultimately, creative differences - reportedly over whether or not the series should adopt a cosy Murder, She Wrote-style approach - saw the Seven Network let go of the property. Production moved to the Nine Network, with a relocation from Melbourne to Sydney during which time Thornton dropped out. The series was retitled Murder Calls before settling on its final name. Ultimately, desiring to create a series with a darker vein than the Verity Birdwood novels, McElroy switched to Rowe's Tessa Vance series, comprising the novels Suspect/Deadline and Something Wicked. Rowe provided story treatments for 38 of the series' 56 episodes, which were then expanded upon by the screenwriters.\nMurder Call was filmed in Sydney and often shot the less spectacular side of the city. The exterior of the Homicide station was filmed at Ashington House (formerly AFT House/Delfin House), on O'Connell Street in Sydney.\nThe first production season consisted of 22 episodes as well as a TV movie, Deadline, based on the novel of the same name by Rowe (which would ultimately air in two parts). The second production season consisted of 32 episodes, which were designed to be aired over two years.Ultimately, Nine aired the episodes over three televised seasons, dramatically out of production order. The third season commenced airing in 1999 but was cancelled in August of that year to budget concerns. The series was taken off air, with the final 9 episodes airing in late 2000. When the episodes were added to the 7plus streaming service in 2021, they were available in the original two production seasons, in order of production.", "hasanswer": false}]}

There is hardly any mixing of colors except for a little red/white, blue/white, and black/white. In the background there are large blocks of canvas painted with the warm colors red, tan, yellow, and orange. On top of that there are random areas covered with blue, red, and tan. On top of that are the colors, white, yellow, and tan. The only piece of this painting that appears to represent any kind of form is the word \u201cJe t'aime\u201d, which is French for \u201cI love you.\u201d These drastic color differences go along with Motherwell\u2019s \u201cpush and pull\u201d concept that all movement within a painting necessarily implies a reciprocal movement in the opposing direction.\nMany people have suspected that Motherwell was in love at the time that he created this piece. However, he actually created the Je t'aime paintings while he was going through a divorce with his second wife. So instead of creating the paintings because he was in love, he created the paintings because he had \u201ca need for love.\"  H. H. Arnason goes on to say that, \u201cMotherwell is unquestionably a romantic whose works are an intense if generalized reflection of his day-to-day life, his innermost emotions, his passionate involvement with art and the world in which he lives.\u201d\nAlong with his longing for love, Motherwell also has a specific technique that he used in Je t'aime. He would first trace what he wanted to draw, make changes and then paint it.  This is a technique that Motherwell used in most of his paintings, and if looked at closely the viewer can see the tracing marks behind the paint. Also most of Motherwell\u2019s paintings are considered collages. Arnason states that \u201cthese paintings retain definite aspects of the geometric cut-out shapes of the collages.\u201d This technique can also be seen in his other work.\nEven though Motherwell used the same technique in his paintings, the one major difference between this work and all his other paintings is color. In his work before and after the Je t'aime series, Motherwell would mainly use either or black and white. For example, before the Je t'aime series he created Elegy to the Spanish Republic XXXIV in 1953-1954: although this painting does have a background showing a little bit of color, he covered the entire background with black shaped bars and ovals, making the color very minimal. In addition to his work before the Je t'aime series, his paintings after this series goes back to mainly using black as the color in his painting. An example would be his painting Totemic Figure, which was created in 1958-1960. This painting shows Motherwell\u2019s use of brushwork to create a black form on the canvas. But instead of using black to cover the background, in Je t'aime No. IV he uses multiple colors that overlap on one another. Arnason expounds on this difference by stating that \u201cthe important difference lies in the sheer, expressionist exuberance of the calligraphy and in the degree to which the surface, with all its brilliant color variations, is unified by the sensuous impasto of the brushwork.\u201d\nAlong with his different use of color in his paintings, there is also a progression of Motherwell\u2019s artistic style, which can be seen through his Je t'aime series. In  Je t'aime No. II, he mainly uses warm colors, few forms and harsh brushwork to express his longing for love. In Je t'aime No. IV he starts to include more overlapping forms and cool colors. Finally in Je t'aime No. VIII Motherwell uses barely any forms, and the entire painting is mostly one color.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "170_387", "question": "Who was Breezing Up created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_15038", "text": "Homer began the canvas in New York in 1873, after he had visited Gloucester, Massachusetts, where he first worked in watercolor. He used the sketches made there, of which the most closely related is Sailing the Catboat (1873), for the oil painting, which he worked on over three years. Infrared reflectography has revealed the many changes he made to the composition during this time, including the removal of a fourth boy near the mast and a second schooner in the distance. At one point the adult held both the sheet and the tiller, a position initially adapted from an oil study of 1874 titled The Flirt. The painting's message is positive; despite the choppy waves, the boaters look relaxed. The anchor that replaced the boy in the bow was understood to symbolize hope. The boy holding the tiller looks forward to the horizon, a statement of optimism about his future and that of the young United States. \nThe finished work indicates that the significant influence of Japanese art on Western painters in the 19th century also touched Homer, particularly in the compositional balance between the left (active) and right (sparse) halves. Homer had visited France in 1866 and 1867, and the influence of marine scenes by the French painters Gustave Courbet and Claude Monet is apparent as well. Not all of Homer's sea pictures are so benevolent as Breezing Up: he portrayed waves crashing ashore as did Courbet (see for example The Wave, c. 1869). Monet's relatively early paintings Seascape: Storm (1867) and The Green Wave (1866) show boats on somewhat turbulent seas.\n\nCompleted in the centennial year 1876, the painting was first exhibited at the National Academy of Design that year, then at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. By 1879, it had come to be known as Breezing Up, a title that was not the artist's but one which he did not seem to object to. A contemporary critic described the painting: \"It is painted in [Homer's] customary coarse and neglig\u00e9 style, but suggests with unmistakable force the life and motion of a breezy summer day off the coast. The fishing boat, bending to the wind, seems actually to cleave the waves. There is no truer or heartier work in the exhibition.\" Another wrote, \"Much has already been said in praise of the easy, elastic motion of the figures of the party in the sailboat, which is scudding along through blue water under 'a fair wind.' They sway with the rolling boat, and relax or grow rigid as the light keel rises or sinks upon the waves. Every person who has been similarly situated can recall how, involuntarily, his back stiffened or his knees bent as he felt the roll of the waves beneath him.\"Today, Breezing Up is considered an iconic American painting, and among Homer's finest. The National Gallery of Art purchased the work in 1943, described by the institution's web site as \"one of the best-known and most beloved artistic images of life in nineteenth-century America.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

For the first time in her career, Madonna co-wrote and co-produced all of the album's tracks. According to Leonard, she was \"very much in love\" and in control when creating the record. The singer worked with Bray and Leonard separately, with the three meeting together only once. Leonard recalled the recording process: \"I would put something together, usually just on piano, and then [Madonna] would come in, we'd mess around with whatever needed to be messed around with, she\u2019d write a lyric, she\u2019d sing it, and the next day we would do another song, one a day\". On the other hand, Bray's job was to \"shape things and [...] create arrangements to show off the song[s] better\".  \"Open Your Heart\" was the first track recorded for the album; it was created as a rock and roll song titled \"Follow Your Heart\" by Gardner Cole and Peter Rafelson for singer Cyndi Lauper. Madonna's team got a demo with songs from Cole's management, among them \"Follow Your Heart\"; she liked the track, changed the title, re-wrote some of the lyrics, and produced it alongside Leonard. They added a bassline underneath, changing it from a rock song into a dance one.\"Papa Don't Preach\" was written by Brian Elliott for a singer named Cristina Dent. When Elliot played Dent's tracks for Warner's Michael Ostin, the same A&R executive who discovered \"Like a Virgin\", Ostin asked if he could play the track for Madonna; Elliot had been working with Dent for six months and was reluctant to let the song go to another artist, but he eventually gave in, finding the idea of Madonna recording his song \"hard to resist\". With lyrics that talk about teenage pregnancy, Madonna was attracted to the track because it \"fit right in with my own personal zeitgeist of standing up to male authorities\". She only contributed with additional lyrics, making \"Papa Don't Preach\" the only song on the album that she did not have a strong hand in writing. \"La Isla Bonita\" marked a \"stylistic shift\" for Madonna, as it's her first song to incorporate Latin motifs, and lyrics in Spanish.  It was created by Leonard as an instrumental and offered to Michael Jackson, who turned it down. After meeting with the singer to start working on True Blue, Leonard presented her the demo and she wrote the lyrics while filming Shanghai Surprise. To get the correct translations, he and Madonna talked over the phone with a Hispanic housekeeper. It was described as a tribute to \"the beauty and mystery of Latin American people\". \"Where's the Party\" is the only track that saw Madonna, Bray and Leonard working together. Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens-Crowder, the authors of Madonna's 1983 hit \"Holiday\", wrote a song called \"Spotlight\" for the album, that was recorded but ultimately not included.

Carloman had an older brother, Charles the Younger, and half brother Pepin the Hunchback, Charlemagne's eldest son. Charlemagne had been king of the Franks since 768, and in 774 conquered the Kingdom of the Lombards in northern Italy, partially on the request of Pope Adrian I for assistance against the Lombard king Desiderius. In 781, Charlemagne and Hildegard brought Carloman along with his younger brother Louis the Pious and sisters Rotrude and Bertha, daughter of Charlemagne to Rome at Adrian's request. Carloman was four years old, but his parents had delayed his baptism so that the Pope could perform it. Carloman was baptized, and Adrian then crowned him as king of the Lombards (later styled king of Italy) and his brother Louis as king of Aquitaine.  As part of Carloman's baptism, he was renamed Pepin, now sharing a name with his half-brother. The reason behind the name change is obscure, but it was likely chosen to evoke the memory of his grandfather Pepin the Short, remembered as a staunch ally of the papacy, and this legacy was important to emphasize for the young king who was to rule Italy.Though only four years old, Pepin's coronation was not nominal\u2014he was brought to Lombardy to live under the care of advisors provided by Charlemagne,the most important of which were Adalard of Corbie, Waldo of Reichenau, the Lombard duke Rotchild, and Angilbert. Pepin's court was based primarily at Verona, though he also operated from palaces in Mantua and the traditional Lombard capital of Pavia. Pepin was king in his own name, but Charlemagne took a strong hand in Italy even into Pepin's adulthood, even on occasion issuing laws directly.After Pepin came of age, he began fulfilling his role as a military leader. He participated in his father's campaign against Tassilo III of Bavaria in 786. In 796, he led a campaign against the Avar Khaganate, taking their stronghold and precipitating the collapse of the Avar state, allowing the Frankish realm to expand eastward. Pepin's victory was celebrated in the contemporary Latin poem De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica. Pepin also led multiple raids against the Duchy of Benevento and a successful campaign in 810 against the Republic of Venice.In 806, Charlemagne gathered his sons and issued the Divisio Regnorum, which outlined formalized plans for the inheritance of the empire upon his death. Pepin was confirmed in this rule of Italy while also gaining most of Bavaria and Alamannia; Louis gained Provence, Septimania, and most of Burgundy in addition to Aquitaine; and Charles as his eldest son in good favour (Pepin the Hunchback having been confined to a monestary after a failed rebellion), was given the largest share of the inheritance, with rule of Francia proper along with Saxony, Nordgau, and parts of Alemannia. Charlemagne did not address the inheritance of the title of emperor he had gained in 800. The Divisio also addressed the death of any of the brothers, and urged peace between them and between any of their nephews who might inherit.Charlemagne's succession plans did not come to fruition. Pepin died on 8 July 810, followed in quick succession by the deaths of his sister Rotrude, his aunt Gisela, Abbess of Chelles, and his half brother Pepin, and his brother Charles over the course of 810\u2013811. All were possibly victims of an epidemic that had spread from cattle in 810. In the wake of these deaths, Charlemagne declared Pepin's son Bernard ruler of Italy, and his own only surviving son Louis as heir to the rest of the empire. Louis and Bernard were formally invested as Charlemagne's heirs in September of 813, and would fully succeed upon his death in 814.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was commissioned by Catherine Lescuyer as a commemorative piece for her father. Rubens created it as part of an altarpiece in the Church of St. Rombout (Rumbold) in Mechelen. The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas dressed in blue turning back towards the viewer and away from the table. Other than Jesus, the most prominent figure is Judas. Judas holds his right hand to his mouth with his eyes avoiding direct contact with the other figures in the painting creating a nervous expression. Jesus is dressed in red and has a yellow halo surrounding his head with his face tilted upwards. Jesus is located centrally in the painting surrounded by his disciples with six on each side, and he holds a loaf of bread with a cup of wine in front of him. Out of all of the figures, he is the most in the light with the figures to the farthest left being the most in shadow. \u201cThe scene thus represents a perfect conflation of the theological significance of the Last Supper\u201d meaning the conflation between the blessing of the bread and the wine while still being pivotal in the sense of revealing the betrayal.As in many other Northern European depictions, a dog with a bone can be seen in the scene, probably a simple pet. It may represent  faith, dogs are traditionally symbols of and are representing faith. According to J. Richard Judson the dog near Judas perhaps represents greed or evil, as the companion of Judas, as in John 13:27.This painting followed the first unsuccessful attempt by Rubens to produce a Last Supper in 1611, when his patrons backed out the last minute, perhaps due to the high price of 4,000 Guilder asked by Rubens.Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper fresco was a significant influence on Rubens who created an etching after the Davinci Last Supper, which was one of Rubens' first attempts to express the full range of human emotion printed by Pieter Soutman. Rubens was also influenced by his humanist ideals from which he extracts biblical themes.Rubens often made engravings following the completion of his works. Other artists used these engravings to serve as a basis of their own works. These copies were even collected. The engravings and copies helped to lead to the popularity of Rubens\u2019 works during his lifetime.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In an interview with IndieGames.com, Cavanagh said that he was interested in using this idea as a core concept of a game, something he felt other games which include a gravity-flipping mechanism had never done before.Cavanagh first unveiled VVVVVV on his blog in June 2009.  The game had been in development for two weeks, and Cavanagh estimated that the game would be finished in another two, \"but hopefully not much longer.\"  A follow-up post published in July 2009 included screenshots of the game and an explanation of the game's gravity-flipping mechanic.  Cavanagh wrote that VVVVVV, unlike some of his previous work such as Judith and Pathways, would not be a \"storytelling experiment\", but rather \"focused on the level design\".  The game was first shown publicly at the 2009 Eurogamer Expo, which gave Cavanagh the opportunity to collect feedback from players.  In December 2009, a beta version of VVVVVV which had been given to donors was leaked on 4chan.The visual style of VVVVVV is heavily inspired by 8-bit computer games from the 1980s, especially Jet Set Willy and Monty on the Run, which is referenced by the element of collecting difficult-to-reach shiny objects and most notably the naming of each room; Cavanagh aimed to create a game \"that looked and felt like the C64 games I grew up with.\" He eventually entrusted naming the rooms to QWOP developer Bennett Foddy, who created every room name in the final version. The game's music is heavily dependent on chiptune elements. Swedish composer Magnus P\u00e5lsson scored the game, and released the original soundtrack in 2010, titled PPPPPP.\nCavanagh also considered this game an opportunity to indulge in his \"retro fetish\".  He has said because he lacks the technical prowess to make more modern-looking games, he instead focuses on making them visually interesting; additionally, he finds this to be made easier by \"work[ing] within narrow limits\". VVVVVV was the first game which Cavanagh sold commercially.  While his previous games were all released as freeware, due to the size of VVVVVV compared to his previous work, Cavanagh felt that he \"couldn't see [himself] going down that route.\"VVVVVV contains many strange visual elements, most notable of which being the sad elephant, sometimes also called the elephant in the room, which is a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant for a short period of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from Jet Set Willy as once believed.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The plant employed 1,500 people in Hyde Park.In the early part of the 20th century, Hyde Park hosted harness racing. The site of the track was redeveloped on the former site of Camp Miegs. The Readville Trotting Park was neighbored by the large B.F.Sturtevant plant, thus prompting the installation of a railway station. The track migrated from horses to auto racing, which was the main attraction at the track until its closure in 1937.In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works attempted to implement two separate interstate highway expansion projects. Both plans would have created a highway that would have passed through land in Hyde Park. The projects were started but, because of public opposition, were never finished.

Many of the artists are anonymous, and their connection to Duccio has emerged only from analysis of a body of work with common stylistic traits. The first pupils, who can be referred to as a group as first-generation followers, were active between about 1290 and 1320 and include the Master of Badia a Isola, the Master of Citt\u00e0 di Castello, the Aringhieri Master, the Master of the Collazioni dei Santi Padri and the Master of San Polo in Rosso.\nAnother group of followers, who could be termed followers of the second generation, were active between about 1300 and 1335 and include Segna di Bonaventura, Ugolino di Nerio, the Master of the Gondi Maest\u00e0, the Master of Monte Oliveto and the Master of Monterotondo. It should, however, be said that Segna di Bonaventura was already active prior to 1300 and so he overlaps as to period both the first and second generation of followers.\nA third group followed Duccio only several years after his death, which shows the impact his painting had on Siena and on Tuscany as a whole. The artists of this third group, active between about 1330 and 1350, include Segna di Bonaventura's sons, that is, Niccol\u00f2 di Segna and Francesco di Segna, and a pupil of Ugolino di Nerio: the Master of Chianciano.\nSome of the artists were influenced by Duccio alone to the point of creating a decided affinity or kinship between their works and his. Among them was the Master of Badia a Isola, and Ugolino di Nerio, along with Segna di Bonaventura and their sons. Other artists were influenced also by other schools, and these include the Aringhieri Master (think of the massive volumes of Giotto), and the Master of the Gondi Maest\u00e0 (who shows the influence also of Simone Martini).\nThe case of Simone Martini and Pietro Lorenzetti is somewhat different. Both artists painted works that have affinities with Duccio: for Simone from about 1305, and Pietro from about 1310 onwards. However, from the outset their work showed distinctive individual features, as can be seen in Simone's Madonna and Child no. 583 (1305\u20131310) and in Pietro's Orsini Triptych, painted at Assisi (about 1310\u20131315).

The statue is very likely the same one that was praised in the highest terms by Pliny the Elder, the main Roman writer on art, who attributed to Greek sculptors but did not say when it was created. The figures in the statue are nearly life-sized, with the entire group measuring just over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in height. The sculpture depicts the Trojan priest Laoco\u00f6n and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being attacked by sea serpents.The Laoco\u00f6n Group has been called \"the prototypical icon of human agony\" in Western art. Unlike the agony often portrayed in Christian art depicting the Passion of Jesus and martyrs, the suffering shown in this statue offers no redemptive power or reward. The agony is conveyed through the contorted expressions on the faces, particularly Laoco\u00f6n's bulging eyebrows, which were noted by Guillaume-Benjamin Duchenne as physiologically impossible. These expressions are mirrored in the struggling bodies, especially Laoco\u00f6n's, with every part of his body shown straining.Pliny attributed the work, then in the palace of Emperor Titus, to three Greek sculptors from the island of Rhodes: Agesander, Athenodoros, and Polydorus, but he did not mention the date or patron. In style it is considered \"one of the finest examples of the Hellenistic baroque\" and certainly in the Greek tradition. However, its origin is uncertain, as it is not known if it is an original work or a copy of an earlier bronze sculpture. Some believe it to be a copy of a work from the early Imperial period, while others think it to be an original work from the later period, continuing the Pergamene style of some two centuries earlier. Regardless, it was probably commissioned for a wealthy Roman's home, possibly from the Imperial family. The dates suggested for the statue range from 200 BC to the 70s AD, with a Julio-Claudian date (27 BC to 68 AD) now being the preferred option.Despite being in mostly excellent condition for an excavated sculpture, the group is missing several parts and underwent several ancient modifications, as well as restorations since its excavation.

{"id": "170_428", "question": "Who was Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_15190", "text": "Along with Robert Campin and later Rogier van der Weyden, Van Eyck revolutionised the approach towards naturalism and realism in Northern European painting during the early to mid 15th century. He was the first to manipulate oils to give the close detailing that infused his figures with the high degree of realism and complexity of emotion seen in this diptych. He coupled this with a mastery of glaze to create luminous surfaces with a deep perspective\u2014most noticeable in the upper portion of the Crucifixion panel\u2014which had not been achieved before.In the 1420s and 1430s, when oil and panel painting were still in their infancy, vertical formats were often used for depictions of the Last Judgement, because the narrow framing particularly suited a hierarchical presentation of heaven, earth and hell. By contrast, depictions of the Crucifixion were usually presented in a horizontal format. To fit such expansive and highly detailed representations onto two equally small and narrow wings, van Eyck was forced to make a number of innovations, redesigning many elements of the Crucifixion panel to match the vertical and condensed presentation of the Judgement narrative. The result is a panel with the crosses rising high into the sky, an unusually packed crowd scene in the mid-ground, and the moving spectacle of the mourners in the foreground, all rendered in a continuous slope from bottom to top in the style of medieval tapestries. Art historian Otto P\u00e4cht says it \"is the whole world in one painting, an Orbis Pictus\".In the Crucifixion panel, van Eyck follows the early 14th-century tradition of presenting the biblical episodes using a narrative technique. According to art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith, the episodes appear as \"simultaneous, not sequential\" events. Van Eyck condenses key episodes from the gospels into a single composition, each placed so as to draw the viewer's eye upward in a logical sequence. This device allowed van Eyck to create a greater illusion of depth with more complex and unusual spatial arrangements. In the Crucifixion panel, he uses different indicators to show the relative closeness of particular groupings of figures to Jesus. Given the size of the mourners in the foreground relative to the crucified figures, the soldiers and spectators gathered in the mid-ground are far larger than a strict adherence to perspective would allow. In the Last Judgement the damned are placed in hell in the lower mid-ground while the saints and angels are positioned higher in the upper foreground. P\u00e4cht writes of this panel that the scene is \"assimilated into a single spatial cosmos\", with the archangel acting as a divider in the pictorial space between heaven and hell.Art historians are unsure as to whether the panels were meant to be a diptych or a triptych. They may have formed the outer wings of a triptych, with a since-lost panel representing the Adoration of the Magi at the centre, or, as the German art historian J.D. Passavant speculated in 1841, the lost centre panel may have been a Nativity. It is now thought unlikely that a lost panel could be the postulated original companion to the outer wings; such a coupling would have been very odd to painters of the 1420s and 1430s. It has also been proposed that a central piece was added later, or as Albert Ch\u00e2telet writes, the central panel may have been stolen. Art historian Erwin Panofsky believed the Crucifixion and Last Judgement panels were intended as a diptych. He argued that it would have been unusual for mere outer wings to have been given the \"sumptuous treatment\" afforded these two panels. This approach is reminiscent of the medieval reliquaries. Others have observed that triptychs were usually much larger works intended for public display, and they tended towards gilded and heavily inscribed frames; typically only the central panel would have been as lavishly decorated as these panels. Contemporary diptychs, in contrast, were usually produced for private devotion and were typically ungilded. There is no documentary evidence for an original central panel, however, and technical examination suggests the two works were intended as wings of a diptych, then an emerging format. P\u00e4cht believes there is not enough evidence to determine whether a third panel existed.The diptych is notable for the first known naturalistic depiction of the Moon's features. It had previously been typical to show the Moon as a blank disk or crescent, or with a human face. Here, the waning gibbous Moon is shown as it would appear in the mid-morning western sky in Judea, including major features such as the Mare Imbrium and the Oceanus Procellarum.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was the first in a series of books that advanced a new \"revisionary\" or antithetical approach to literary criticism. Bloom's central thesis is that poets are hindered in their creative process by the ambiguous relationship they necessarily maintain with precursor poets. While admitting the influence of extraliterary experience on every poet, he argues that \"the poet in a poet\" is inspired to write by reading another poet's poetry and will tend to produce work that is in danger of being derivative of existing poetry, and, therefore, weak. Because poets historically emphasize an original poetic vision in order to guarantee their survival into posterity, the influence of precursor poets inspires a sense of anxiety in living poets. Thus Bloom attempts to work out the process by which the small minority of 'strong' poets manage to create original work in spite of the pressure of influence. Such an agon (a vain attempt by a writer to resolve the conflict between his ideas and those of a much more influential predecessor), Bloom argues, depends on six revisionary ratios, which reflect Freudian and quasi-Freudian defense mechanisms, as well as the tropes of classical rhetoric.\nBefore writing this book, Bloom spent a decade studying the Romantic poets of the early nineteenth century. This is reflected in the emphasis given to those poets and their struggle with the influence of John Milton, Robert Burns, and Edmund Spenser. Other poets analyzed range from Lucretius and Dante to Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and John Ashbery. In The Anxiety of Influence and other early books, Bloom claimed that influence was particularly important for post-enlightenment poets. Conversely, he suggested that influence might have been less of a problem for such poets as Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Bloom later changed his mind, and the most recent editions of The Anxiety of Influence include a preface claiming that Shakespeare was troubled early in his career by the influence of Christopher Marlowe. The book itself is divided into six major categories, called \"six revisionary ratios\" by Bloom.  They are clinamen, tessera, kenosis, daemonization, askesis, and apophrades.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As common in van Eyck's work, attention to detail is maximum, thanks to his technique using successive layers of colors diluted with oil, which allowed him deep effects of transparency and lucidity.

It is housed in the National Gallery of Art of Washington, D.C., United States.\nBindo Altoviti was a rich banker born in Rome in 1491 of Florentine origin. He was a cultured man who liked the arts.\nThe graceful, almost effeminate position of the subject along with the heavy contrast between light and shadow are atypical of Raphael's work, particularly of his portraits of men, demonstrating the artist's experimentation with different styles and forms in his later Roman period.  The influence of the works of Leonardo, which Raphael studied astutely during this period of his career, is strikingly evident in this particular piece.\nThe painting was a property of Altoviti's descendants until 1808, when it was sold to Ludwig I of Bavaria. It remained at the Alte Pinakothek until 1936, when, after many debates about its attribution, the painting was lured out of Nazi Germany by \"canny English dealers\". Acquired by Samuel Henry Kress, the portrait subsequently became property of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C..\nA bronze bust of Altoviti by Benvenuto Cellini is exhibited in Boston at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He received his first fountain pen related patent in 1889. In 1894, Parker received a patent on his \"Lucky Curve\" fountain pen feed, which was claimed to draw excess ink back into the pen barrel when the pen was not in use.  The company's first successful pen, released in 1899, was the Parker Jointless. The Lucky Curve feed was used in various forms until 1928.\nFrom the 1920s to the 1960s, before the development of the ballpoint pen, Parker was either number one or number two in worldwide writing instrument sales. In 1931, Parker created Quink (quick drying ink), which eliminated the need for blotting. In 1941, the company developed the most widely used fountain pen model in history, the Parker 51, which led to over $400 million in sales during its 30-year history. Manufacturing facilities were set up over the years in Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, France, Mexico, USA, Pakistan, India, Germany (Osmia-Parker), Brazil and Argentina.\nIn 1954, Parker released the Parker Jotter ballpoint pen with its original nylon body and inverted \"V\" clip. The Jotter would go on to sell over 750 million units during its history. In 1955, the company introduced its Liquid Lead pencil, which used liquid graphite to write like a pen.  However, the Scripto company had introduced a similar product called Fluidlead a few months prior. To avoid a costly patent fight, the companies agreed to share their formulas with each other.The company bought retailer and catalog company Norm Thompson in 1973, and then sold it in 1981. In 1976 Parker acquired Manpower just as the temporary staffing market was surging.  In time Manpower provided more revenue than the pen business.  A 1982 spinoff, Sintered Specialties, Inc., became SSI Technologies, a manufacturer of automotive sensors.A management buyout in 1986 moved the company's headquarters to Newhaven, East Sussex, England, which was the original location of the Valentine Pen Company previously acquired by Parker. In 1993 Parker was purchased by the Gillette Company, which already owned the Paper Mate brand \u2013 the best-selling disposable ballpoint. In 2000 Gillette sold its writing instruments division to the company Newell Rubbermaid, whose Sanford Stationery Division became the largest writing instrument manufacturers in the world at that time, simultaneously owning such brand names as Rotring, Sharpie, Reynolds as well as Parker, PaperMate, Waterman, and Liquid Paper.After Parker's unique design patent for its Jotter classic metal ink refill cartridge expired, low cost generic copies produced in China led to increased commercial competition. Parker's sales began to see drastic adverse effects as a result. In July 2009 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. in response announced that it had decided to close down the Parker production factory at Newhaven in England, with the dismissal of 180 employees from the facility, and relocate production to France. The following month, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. announced that the factory in Janesville, Wisconsin, was also to close the remaining operation there producing Parker Pens (which eliminated a further 153 manufacturing jobs). The company press release stated: \"This decision is a response to structural issues accelerated by market trends and is in no way a reflection on the highly valued work performed by our Janesville employees over the years.\" Newell Rubbermaid offered 'transitional employment services' along with severance pay in compensation to the dismissed workforce.Subsequently, Parker has abandoned its traditional retail outlets in North America. While some of its former staple Jotter pens may be found in retailers such as Office Depot, the Parker line has been moved to upscale \"luxury\" retailers in an abandonment of its former business model of quality manufacture combined with mass market appeal and pricing. With this commercial strategic move Parker also altered its traditional product warranty on its high end pens, changing the former lifetime guarantee to a two-year warranty limitation.Parker Pen Co. was an aviation pioneer. The interest of Parker Pen Co. in aircraft came from Kenneth Parker, son of the founder; he enlisted in the fledgling air service and, after flight training at Miami Air Base, he was assigned to officer training in tactical maneuvers at Pensacola Naval Air Station, Florida. From their first company business plane, the Parker Duofold Fairchild, they used it as an innovative advertising weapon inviting his dealers.

Despite the lack of success of these releases, Bridges came to the attention of Bill Lowery, who became her manager, subsidizing Bridges over a roughly two-year period. During this time, he canvassed record labels on her behalf, which led to her signing with Polydor in 1977.\nBridges's self-titled debut album was the inaugural production by Steve Buckingham, who was assigned to produce Bridges after playing guitar on one of her earliest sessions. Bridges and her personal and songwriting partner Susan Hutcheson had written a song entitled \"Disco 'Round\", which, at Buckingham's suggestion, was recorded as \"I Love the Nightlife\", as Buckingham felt that the song was R&B rather than disco (\"Disco 'Round\" was retained as the song's subtitle): Bridges herself would later admit she had had hopes that the song would be received as a Memphis soul number, calling it \"something Al Green might sing\". However, club support was a key factor in the success of the track, which became a \"sleeper\" Top 40 hit, spending 27 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 with a peak of number five, and also appearing on several international hit parades as evinced by the Billboard's \"Hits of the World\" chart. The song was also in the #5 position on the Record World and Cash Box charts. It was also a \"crossover\" hit, receiving play even on country music stations. The cover of the 1978 self-titled LP features an early skyline picture of Atlanta, Georgia.\nIn 1978, Bridges was a Grammy nominee and was the opening act, performing \"I Love the Nightlife\". Bridges' self-titled LP, Alicia Bridges, was also rising on the Billboard, Cash Box and Record World charts, and the LP remained on the charts for up to 35 weeks. Both the LP and the single release were international successes, and \"I Love the Nightlife\" went top-40 in the UK and Germany, Spain and other European countries. Bridges's music was especially popular in Japan. She received an RIAA Certified Gold Record for the sale of over one million copies of her hit single in the United States, as well as a gold record from Canada.\nContrary to the impression created by her success with \"I Love the Nightlife\", Bridges was primarily a singer of R&B, rock, blues and love songs. \"I Love the Nightlife\" has a definite back beat and organ similar to early 1970s R&B; the original intention was for \"I Love the Nightlife\" to be an R&B song, but when Bill Lowery first heard the song, he saw its disco potential: subsequently, a 12\" single remix was created by Jim Burgess, ultimately becoming a worldwide club smash.\n\"I Love the Nightlife\" has been featured in several movies, including Love at First Bite, The Last Days of Disco and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\nBridges's second single, \"Body Heat\", was a rock song with strong electric guitar rhythms. It was a \"rock/dance\" song released at a time when there was some rivalry between disco fans and rock fans; this time period began to see more songs that mixed the genres of rock and disco to create a \"rock/disco\" flavor.\nIn an interview, Bridges mentioned Elvis Presley as the singer who originally aroused her interest in rock music, but she has always considered herself an R&B singer. She cited Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle as her 1970s influences. She said that she did not care for white female singers as a rule, with the exceptions being Joni Mitchell and Janis Joplin.

The scene is based on the mythological princess Dana\u00eb, as \u2013 very briefly \u2013 recounted by the Roman poet Ovid, and at greater length by Boccaccio.  She was isolated in a bronze tower following a prophecy that her firstborn would eventually kill her father. Although aware of the consequences, Dana\u00eb was seduced and became pregnant by Zeus (in Roman mythology Jupiter), who, inflamed by lust, descended from Mount Olympus to seduce her in the form of a shower of gold.\nThough the composition, especially the main figure, is essentially the same, the six or more versions vary considerably. The major surviving versions are in Naples, London, Madrid, Vienna, Chicago, and St. Petersburg.  The voluptuous figure of Dana\u00eb, with legs half spread, hardly changes, and was probably traced from a studio drawing or version.  Her bed and its hangings are another constant.  Other elements vary considerably; the first version, now in Naples, was painted between 1544\u201346, and is the only one with a figure of Cupid at the right, rather than an old woman catching the shower of gold.  She is a different figure at each appearance, though the pose in the Hermitage follows the Prado version.  The small dog resting at Dana\u00eb's side in the Prado and Chicago versions is generally absent.\nThe works influenced the compositions of many artists including Rembrandt, Anthony van Dyck and Gustav Klimt, who all painted versions of the scene. Giorgio Vasari recounts a visit with Michelangelo to Titian's studio, where they saw the original in progress. Michelangelo praised Titian's use of colour in the Madrid painting, though later, in private, he was critical of Titian's draftsmanship.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He moved in 1900 to a house on the Nesset at Atna in the \u00d8sterdalen valley in Eastern Norway. He was joined in 1901 by his wife Lilli Rachel Hennum; they remained at Atna until 1902, when they moved further north to R\u00f8ros.\nHe made several studies in the period 1900\u20131902 in a variety of media, including  charcoal, crayon, oil and watercolor.

Lowe said he looked for an unconventional adventure game protagonist that could be \"butt of all the jokes\" in a game that would not be about saving the world or rescuing princesses but would rather deal with adult themes using humor. He recalled: \"I tried to make him the opposite of a GQ model: short, overweight, balding, with comb-over hair, and so on. Larry is out of shape, losing his hair, not very successful with women, always thinking about sex - in other words, he's exactly like most guys. (...) The tough part was making Larry likable, since at first glance, he comes off as smarmy, sexist, and unlikable. I tried to make Larry resemble most guys I know: neither morons nor geniuses, basically honest and good, with a desire for more sex than they actually get. Men relate to Larry because no matter how big a loser you are, you're not as bad off as Larry!\"In Lowe's words, Larry was \"modeled after a salesman for [Lowe's game company] Sierra On-Line that shall remain nameless. He would return from sales trip and brag to us about how much ass he had gotten. Those of us sitting there coding hated him.\" While making Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, Sierra On-Line staff had to decide the character's name. They agreed that he should be named after a certain Jerry (Lowe never made his last name known to the public), who had visited him at work and became well known in the Sierra studios. Jerry thought of himself as a great lover and became an infamous point of comical reference among the staff, so the game creators agreed that since Jerry's character suited the game's protagonist, they should jokingly tribute him. However, since they thought it would be immoral to use a real person's full name as a comical reference, \"Jerry\" was then altered to \"Larry\", a similar name, in honor of injury attorney Larry H. Parker, a childhood friend of Lowe. Lowe had to find a new surname, and having in mind the many L-words of the title, skimmed through the 'L' volume of an encyclopedia in order to find a suitable word or name. He fell on the entry of Arthur Laffer, and the name caught his attention due to its phonetic resemblance to 'laugher'. Arthur Laffer for years had no idea about the existence of the games until much later when Lowe sent a letter asking his permission for the publication of a program under the title Laffer Utilities, a Larry spin-off which could potentially confuse the public due to the ambiguous title. Laffer asked his secretary if she knew about the games and she told him that she had played them for years, but never made a connection. Laffer gave the permission and also paid a visit to the Sierra studios.One of Larry's trademarks is his manner of introducing himself: \"Hi, my name is Larry; Larry Laffer\", a reference to James Bond's introduction style, \"My name is Bond; James Bond\". The \"Leisure Suit\" part came from Al Lowe's statement to Sierra founder Ken Williams that the series' predecessor Softporn Adventure was so dated that it should be wearing a leisure suit. The rest of his look includes \"a Hawaiian shirt, a gold medallion, and a chest toupee because [Lowe] wanted him to be as out of it as possible.\" Originally, Larry was a typical 16-colored sprite, although on box covers he was seen as a cartoon with huge triangular head and nose. Lowe said about Larry's nose: \"When we started, [Sierra artist] Mark Crowe gave me a choice: Larry could have either a huge nose or no nose because with only 160 pixels horizontally, his 'nose pixel' could be either on or off. Later, as graphics developed, Larry's look became more refined, but always in keeping with his loser image.\" As technology advanced to allow more cartoon-like graphics, the VGA games updated the sprite to resemble the depiction of Larry on the covers. In the latter games with full voice-over soundtrack, Larry is voiced by actor Jan Rabson in all games except Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust, where he is voiced by Jeffrey Tambor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At the time of this painting the snow had begun to melt.  It's thought that this painting is one of his first paintings made in Arles.  In a letter to his brother Theo about February 24, 1888, Van Gogh describes having completed three paintings in as many days, one of them \"a landscape in the snow.\"The painting is made of the La Crau plain and Montmajour in the background.  The audience is drawn in by the road that starts at the lower left hand corner of the frame right towards the trees, hills and snow-covered mountains at the horizon.  Horizontal brushstrokes emphasize the plain that fills most of the painting; tension is created by the diagonal strokes of the road cutting across the plain.  Van Gogh uses color to depict the components of the landscape.  White and violet are used for snow.  Brown, green and blue is used to suggest puddles and slush left by melting snow.  Tufts of grass are painted in yellow along the side of the road.  The view is accented by the red roofs along the horizon, brown dog, and the brown jacket and black hat of the man walking in the field.Van Gogh, an avid collector of Japanese art woodcut prints, may have been inspired by the prints with snowy scenes.  If so, he had not left behind the standards used in Dutch landscape paintings which use dark greens and browns within the foreground and blues in the sky.  What is unusual, though, is that the horizon sits high on the horizon, the attention focused on the foreground and land leading up to the house, nearly as if Van Gogh was walking behind the man and dog on the field.  A few days later, following a new snow storm, Van Gogh painted another similar but less detailed landscape, Snowy Landscape with Arles in the Background (F391).", "hasanswer": false}]}

However PVCS can also be configured to support several users simultaneously attempting to edit the file; in this case the second chronological committer will have a branch created for them so that both modifications, instead of conflicting, will appear as parallel histories for the same file.

In the series, which is set in the 19th century, Allen is a teenager who joins the Black Order\u2014a group of soldiers known as exorcists. Allen uses an object called Innocence to fight demons known as Akuma. Allen's Innocence initially assumes the form of a gigantic left arm and evolves to give him new abilities, which he uses to fight the Millennium Earl\u2014who created an army of Akuma to destroy the world\u2014and his superhuman followers the Noah Family. Allen learns he is connected to the Noah and might become one of them.\nHoshino based Allen's characterization on Robin, the shorter-haired female protagonist of the one-shot comic Zone. She designed Allen's clothing to resemble that of the nineteenth century, giving him a ribbon tie and other accessories to make him appear gentlemanly. Hoshino gave Allen a calm demeanor in contrast with her typical rambunctious, rude characters; and to make him look intimidating she gave Allen a pentagram-shaped scar. The manga was adapted for television as an anime series in which Allen was voiced by Sanae Kobayashi. The voices were recast for the 2016 anime television series D.Gray-man Hallow, in which Ayumu Murase replaced Kobayashi.

The Coachman is also served by silhouetted minions with ape-like arms. In the film the Coachman's fate is unknown, but in a deleted scene, the Coachman notices Pinocchio's escape and hires Honest John and Gideon to apprehend him dead or alive only for the two are stopped and arrested by the carabinieri. In the video game adaptation, he hinders Pinocchio's escape as a boss and is kicked off a cliff.\nThe Coachman cameos in House of Mouse as an audience member.\nIn the Descendants novel The Isle of the Lost, the Coachman receives his comeuppance: after finding all his victims turned donkeys upon his arrest and turning them back into human children, he is exiled to the Isle of the Lost where he has become a taxi driver that operates a taxi pulled by normal donkeys.\nIn Geppetto, the Coachman is replaced by a Pleasure Island ringmaster (portrayed by Usher). He manages to escape retribution despite Geppetto discovering his plan.\nThe Coachman, like Stromboli, do not appear in the Once Upon a Time, there is no mention of them. Their fate is also unknown.\nLuke Evans portrays the Coachman in the 2022 live-action remake.

Similarly to the video game, pursues Pinocchio when he tries to escape, then believing him dead when he dives from a cliff and he says, \"Bollocks! A wooden donkey would've been worth a bleeding fortune\".\nThe Coachman appears in Giuliano Cenci's 1972 animated film The Adventures of Pinocchio, voiced by Gianni Bonagura in the Italian version. He is portrayed more closely to the book than his Disney counterpart. The Coachman works alone and is portrayed as an effeminate and alluring character with a high-pitched voice, who easily tricks Pinocchio and Candlewick into coming to the Land of Toys. However, his punishment for disobedient donkeys is omitted.\nIn Luigi Comencini's 1972 miniseries, the Coachman is portrayed by Riccardo Billi and has a melancholy appearance. This is the only adaptation that retains the Coachman's punishment for donkeys.\nIn the 1972 anime series episode \"Pleasureland\", Clarissa, the poppy witch and sworn enemy of the Oak Fairy, takes on the Coachman's role. She takes the form of a little girl to lure rascals into Pleasureland where she led them into her malevolent dimension of torture and horror.\nIn Steve Barron's 1996 film, the character's role is merged with that of Mangiafuoco and The Terrible Dogfish into Lorenzini, portrayed by Udo Kier. Pinocchio accidentally sets Lorenzini's theater on fire, causing Lorenzini to change career and begin luring unruly children to Terra Magica where the children inevitably drink cursed water, turning them into donkeys. During a struggle with Pinocchio, Lorenzini falls into the water and turns into a sea monster, which swims out to the ocean.\nIn Roberto Benigni's 2002 film, the Coachman, portrayed by Luis Molteni in the Italian version and by Erik Bergmann in the English dub, is depicted in a similar manner to Cenci's adaptation. In this version, his clients are made aware of how he provides the donkeys, themselves witnessing the transformation of the boys when they are asleep.\nIn the Compagnia della Rancia's 2003 musical, the Coachman is reimagined as a school bus driver, just as the Land of Toys is reimagined as a school (called \"Dunce High School\"). In this version he is also the director of the circus where Pinocchio and the other children, transformed into donkeys, are made to perform.\nIn the 2004 animated film Pinocchio 3000, the Coachman and Mangiafuoco are merged to form the film's main antagonist Mayor Scamboli. A rich robotics tycoon who hates noisy children and the nature they so protect, he has a playground built at the suggestion of his beloved daughter to keep them out of his way. Then inspired by a remark by Pinocchio, he modifies one of the attractions to transform children into robots, into which he also introduces Geppetto, his rival and adversary.\nIn the 2007 animated film Bentornato Pinocchio, the Coachman (voiced by Vittorio Amandola) is the main antagonist and, after avoiding his punishment, hires the Cat and the Fox to take revenge on Pinocchio and kidnap Santa Claus. At the end of the film, the man is punished by the Blue Fairy: he ends up transformed into a stick of butter and eaten by the villagers.\nIn the 2013 French miniseries, the Coachman, portrayed by Axel Neumann, is represented faithfully to the novel, except for his more tramp-like appearance and the magic whip that allows him to transform children into donkeys.

Galan, however, does not die: after bonding with the Sentience of the Universe, he changes and gestates for billions of years in an egg made of the debris of his ship that the current universe formed after the Big Bang. He emerges as Galactus, and though a Watcher named Ecce observes Galactus' birth and recognizes his destructive nature, Ecce chooses not to kill Galactus. Starving for sustenance, Galactus consumes the nearby planet of Archeopia \u2014 the first of many planets he would destroy to maintain his existence. Subsequently, in memory of his dead homeworld of Taa and the first planet (Archeopia) to fall prey to his cosmic hunger, Galactus constructs a new \"homeworld\": the M\u00f6bius strip-shaped space station called Taa II.\nGalactus becomes involved in a civil war among the \"Proemial Gods\", who had come into being during the universe's infancy. When a faction of these gods led by Diableri of Chaos attempts to remake the universe in their own image, Galactus kills Diableri and imprisons three others (Antiphon the Overseer, Tenebrous of the Darkness Between, and Aegis, Lady of All Sorrows) in the prison called the Kyln.Galactus then creates the being Tyrant out of a desire for companionship, but the two ultimately engage in a major conflict. Galactus decides to create his first herald \u2014 the Fallen One \u2014 who ultimately rebels against his master. When approaching the planet of Zenn-La, Galactus accepts the offer of Norrin Radd to become his herald, the Silver Surfer, in exchange for sparing his world. Eventually locating Earth, Galactus is driven off by the Fantastic Four, Uatu the Watcher, and the rebellious Silver Surfer after the Human Torch II \u2014 with Uatu's assistance \u2014 retrieves the Ultimate Nullifier from Taa II. Although Galactus leaves Earth, vowing that he will never try to consume it again, he banishes the Surfer into exile on Earth for betraying him. Galactus later returns for his former herald, but the Surfer is unrepentant and chooses to remain on Earth. Thor learns of Galactus' origin when the entity comes into conflict with Ego the Living Planet.Returning to Earth, Galactus unsuccessfully tries to re-enlist the Silver Surfer. After the Fantastic Four and the Surfer defeat Galactus' new herald, the Air-Walker, Mr. Fantastic reprograms Galactus' ship to travel to the Negative Zone, which contains many uninhabited worlds that could potentially be consumed.

After returning to normal form, Galactus is sought by the Fantastic Four to help stop a new cosmic threat, the Sphinx. Mr. Fantastic offers to release Galactus from his vow to not devour Earth if he helps to defeat the Sphinx. Galactus agrees, if the Fantastic Four first recruit a alien being called Tyros as his new herald. The quartet succeed, and the newly empowered and renamed Terrax the Tamer leads his master to Earth. Galactus locates and defeats the Sphinx in Egypt, but is confronted by Mr. Fantastic, who, unbeknownst to Galactus, wields a fake Ultimate Nullifier. Unable to read Richards' mind (which is protected by Uatu the Watcher), Galactus retreats.Galactus empowers and uses the superheroine known as the Dazzler to locate a missing Terrax who is, in fact, hiding from his master inside a black hole. The Dazzler defeats and retrieves Terrax, and forces Galactus to return her to Earth. Galactus is fooled by the Galadorian Space Knight Rom into trying to devour the Black Nebula, the homeworld of the Dire Wraiths, but he is repelled by the Wraiths' Dark Sun. A weakened Galactus pursues the rebellious Terrax to Earth and strips him of his power. Near death, Galactus is saved by the Fantastic Four and the Avengers while also acquiring another herald: Nova II, who offers herself as Galactus' herald in exchange for him sparing Earth again. Galactus devours the Skrulls' throneworld of Tarnax IV, and discusses his role in the universe with fellow cosmic entity Death. Mr. Fantastic is captured by the Shi'ar for saving Galactus' life, and is tried by all of the aliens who survived the annihilation of their homeworlds by Galactus. During the trial, the cosmic entity Eternity \u2014 the sentient embodiment of space and reality of the Marvel Universe \u2014 intervenes, allowing all beings present to momentarily become one with the universe, allowing them to understand that Galactus is a necessary part of the cosmic order.During the Secret Wars, Galactus attempts to consume Battleworld to force the Beyonder to remove his cosmic hunger, but his plan is foiled by Doctor Doom. Galactus grants clemency to the Silver Surfer, who aids his former master against the Elders of the Universe and the In-Betweener. Galactus also rescues the Surfer and Nova II from Mephisto's realm, and aids the cosmic hierarchy in a war against the mad Eternal Thanos, who wields the Infinity Gauntlet.When Nova II is conscience-stricken at causing the death of billions of aliens, Galactus dismisses her and creates a new herald, the bloodthirsty Morg the Executioner. Tyrant eventually returns and Morg sacrifices himself to stop the former creation of Galactus by using the Ultimate Nullifier. Galactus then decides, with help from his new herald Red Shift, to only devour the energy of living beings, which brings him into conflict with alien races and Earth's superheroes. During a final confrontation near Chandilar, the throneworld of the Shi'ar Empire, the Silver Surfer turns Galactus' siphoning machines against him. A starving Galactus dies and assumes the form of a star. The death of Galactus allows the entity Abraxas (a metaphysical embodiment of destruction and the antithesis of Eternity) to emerge from his imprisonment. The entity wreaks havoc across thousands of alternate universes, killing various incarnations of Galactus before the children of Mr. Fantastic \u2014 Franklin Richards and Valeria von Doom \u2014 exhaust their powers to restore the original Galactus. Galactus then provides Mr. Fantastic with the Ultimate Nullifier, which he uses to reset reality and prevent Abraxas' initial escape and destruction.Conscience-stricken, Galactus tries to rid himself of his cosmic hunger by feeding on the power from the Infinity Gems, but is tricked into releasing the Hunger, a being which feeds on entire universes. The Hunger is destroyed when Thanos orchestrates a final battle between it and Galactus. When an alien race develops a technology to make planets invisible to Galactus, he empowers the Human Torch II (who has traded powers with his sister the Invisible Woman and becomes the Invisible Boy as a result of this) and utilizes the hero as an unwilling herald to locate the planets. The Fantastic Four and Quasar free the Torch by changing Galactus back into the humanoid Galan, who chooses to exile himself to an energy-rich alternate dimension before he can transform back into Galactus so that he can feed on that reality without endangering planets.Galactus consumes Beta Ray Bill's Korbinite homeworld with the help of his new herald, Stardust. After Annihilus declares war on the universe, the entity attacks and destroys the Kyln, freeing former Galactus foes Tenebrous and Aegis (Antiphon had already died under unknown circumstances). Sensing their release, Galactus temporarily releases Stardust from his service and re-employs the Silver Surfer as his herald due to his familiarity with their old foes. Tenebrous and Aegis, however, find and defeat the Surfer and Galactus and deliver them to Annihilus. Annihilus intends to use Galactus as a weapon to destroy all life in the universe, but is thwarted when the entity is freed by Drax the Destroyer. Galactus retaliates and destroys most of Annihilus' forces. Seeking a final confrontation with Tenebrous and Aegis, Galactus sends the Silver Surfer to locate them. The Surfer eventually draws the pair into the barrier between the universe and the Negative Zone, which destroys both of them.After an encounter with Epoch, Galactus consumes the planet Orbucen. When a distraught Beta Ray Bill seeks vengeance for the destruction of the Korbinites' homeworld, Galactus relents and creates a female Korbinite as a companion for Bill. Galactus also consumes the planet Sakaar, earning the enmity of the Hulk's alien-born twin sons, Skaar and Hiro-Kala.A \"celestial parasite\" within Galactus is revealed to have spawned a daughter, \"Gali\" a.k.a. Galacta, who secretly lives on Earth working as a doctor and superhero while seeking to suppress her own cosmic hunger.

Mr. Fantastic explains that, in the distant future, the heroes on a dying Earth had killed Galactus and then escaped to the present via time travel. When Galactus discovers these heroes now live on a planet called Nu-Earth, he destroys it and its inhabitants in retribution.A tear in the fabric of space caused by the Annihilation Wave and other interstellar conflicts allows the extra-universal forces of the Cancerverse (an alternate universe without death) to invade. Galactus, the Celestials and the resurrected Tenebrous and Aegis combat the powerful Cancerverse weapon: the Galactus Engine (constructed from the corpse of the Cancerverse's counterpart to Galactus). During the events of the Chaos War, Galactus is teleported to Earth by the Olympian demigod Hercules to help fight the Chaos King, a metaphysical embodiment of Oblivion and another antithesis of Eternity. While the Hulk and his allies the God Squad, Alpha Flight, and several members of the Avengers fight Amatsu-Mikaboshi's forces, Amadeus Cho and Galactus develop a machine which will move Earth to a safe location in a sealed-off continuum, only to adapt the plan by trapping Amatsu-Mikaboshi in that dimension instead.After an encounter with the High Evolutionary, Galactus invades Asgard, home of the Norse Gods, seeking an Asgardian artifact to sate his cosmic hunger and spare future civilizations. Odin, ruler of the Norse Gods, contends that Galactus wishes to ensure that he is not replaced in the next universe. To avoid a protracted battle, the Silver Surfer offers to remain on Earth to guard the artifact on the condition that Galactus may have it once Asgard eventually passes. Galactus recruits a human preacher from Earth named Pastor Mike (full name unknown) that he names the Praeter to be his new herald. Later, when the Mad Celestials from Earth-4280 invade, Galactus destroys one before being struck down by the others. Revived by Franklin Richards, he and Franklin succeed in vanquishing the remaining Mad Celestials, and prevent the destruction of Earth. In the aftermath, Galactus learns that he will no longer face the eventual end of the universe alone; he and Franklin will witness it together.Galactus is then pulled through a hole in space-time to an alternate universe and meets another version of himself: a space-faring mechanical hive mind called Gah Lak Tus. After the two merge with one another, Galactus makes his way towards this universe's Earth in an attempt to consume it. The heroes of the alternate Earth travel to Earth-616 to acquire information on Galactus and eventually manage to send Galactus to the Negative Zone, reasoning that he will eventually starve to death, as the region is composed entirely of anti-matter. A comatose Galactus is found by the Eternals and Aarkus, who hope to use him in their war against the Kree.Galactus returns to the universe, and after an encounter with Squirrel Girl, is forced into his own incubator by the Ultimates, who are determined to end his threat. Galactus re-emerges as a Lifebringer instead of a Devourer of Worlds, his first act as such a being to re-create Archeopia, the first planet that he ever consumed. Galactus later rescues the team at the behest of Eternity, and learns that the latter has been imprisoned by an unknown force. Galactus also comes into conflict with fellow cosmic entities Master Order and Lord Chaos, who, along with the Molecule Man, wish for Galactus to return to his former role as a Devourer of Worlds and thereby restore the cosmic order. Galactus locates the superhero known as the Anti-Man outside the Multiverse and, after transforming him into a Herald of Life, sends him to recruit the recently disbanded Ultimates to help discover the identity of Eternity's captor, who is later revealed to be the First Firmament, the first iteration of the cosmos. Master Order and Lord Chaos bring Galactus to trial before the Living Tribunal, still seeking to restore Galactus to his former state for the sake of the cosmic order. Although Galactus successfully argues that the balance of the new Multiverse is different and that his old role is obsolete, the Tribunal is destroyed by a Firmament-influenced Master Order and Lord Chaos. After a brief battle, Master Order decides to create a new cosmic order, which it and Lord Chaos would control. Their former servant, the In-Betweener, is forcibly merged with them into a new cosmic being called Logos. After destroying several Celestials, Logos forcibly transforms Galactus back into the Devourer of Worlds. The process is reversed when the Anti-Man sacrifices his life to restore Galactus as the Lifebringer.

The paintings\u2014Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear\u2014are each approximately 45.75 by 35.5 inches (116.2 by 90.2 cm), and are now in the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. The four freedoms refer to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's January 1941 Four Freedoms State of the Union address, in which he identified essential human rights that should be universally protected. The theme was incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and became part of the Charter of the United Nations. The paintings were reproduced in The Saturday Evening Post over four consecutive weeks in 1943, alongside essays by prominent thinkers of the day. They became the highlight of a touring exhibition sponsored by The Post and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The exhibition and accompanying sales drives of war bonds raised over $132 million.This series has been the cornerstone of retrospective art exhibits presenting the career of Rockwell, who was the most widely known and popular commercial artist of the mid-20th century, but did not achieve critical acclaim. These are among his best-known works, and by some accounts became his most widely distributed paintings. At one time they were commonly displayed in post offices, schools, clubs, railroad stations, and a variety of public and semi-public buildings.Critical review of these images, like most of Rockwell's work, has not been entirely positive. Rockwell's idyllic and nostalgic approach to regionalism made him a popular illustrator but a lightly regarded fine artist during his lifetime, a view still prevalent today. However, he has created an enduring niche in the social fabric with Freedom from Want, emblematic of what is now known as the \"Norman Rockwell Thanksgiving\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

Historically it has always been the other way around. Now we are changing the roles. And a lot of men are enjoying that.\" She notes that the surrounding area has a strongly male character, with numerous statues of \"male persons standing on pedestals\" and the male-dominated culture that goes with London's status as a business centre. The statue is intended to be a humorous counterbalance, contrasting with the very formal equestrian statues on the square's other three plinths: \"Humour is always a big thing for me. It stops things from becoming too severe. I like English humour. It is so often very dark.\"The sculpture was selected by the Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group, a panel of specialist advisors that guides and monitors the commissions for the plinth. According to a press release issued by the group to announce Fritsch as the winner of the commission,\n\nThe sculpture ... communicates on different levels. First of all is the consideration of the formal aspect of its placement: the mostly grey architecture of Trafalgar Square would receive an unexpectedly strong colour accentuation, the size and colour of the animal making the whole situation surreal or simply unusual. The cockerel is also a symbol for regeneration, awakening and strength and finally, the work refers, in an ironic way, to male-defined British society and thoughts about biological determinism.\nIt was unveiled on 25 July 2013 by Mayor of London Boris Johnson. He pointed out the irony that the cockerel, an unofficial national emblem of France, was standing in a square commemorating a famous British victory over the French. Fritsch has said that she was unaware of the connection until it was explained to her. According to Fritsch, she chose the cockerel to represent strength and regeneration, \"but it's a nice humorous side-effect to have something French in a place that celebrates victory over Napoleon. He has come back as a cockerel!\" Johnson said in his speech that \"I hope French people will not take it as excessive British chauvinism \u2013 but for me it stands for the recent British triumph in the Tour de France, which we have won twice in a row ... it is a symbol of French sporting pride, brought like a chicken to London. We have mounted this French cock at the heart of our imperial square.\"Fritsch and Johnson have both noted the sexual double entendre in the work's name  \u2013 hahn in German has the same double meaning as \"cock\" in English \u2013 and the artist admits that it is consciously intended as a play on words. She highlighted the fact that Trafalgar Square itself has a somewhat phallic character: \"It's about male posing, about showing power, about showing ... erections! I mean, look at that column!\" Asked whether he felt that the cock had crushed his manhood, Johnson said: \"No, not at all. I am happy to channel the power and enthusiasm of that bird; I feel inspired by its regal manner and mood of confidence.\" He told the crowd that he would \"not lapse into double entendres and ask how long this wonderful creature will 'stay up' in the square,\" before unveiling what he called a \"big, blue ... bird.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

During this time, there was an emphasis put on the ideal man who was shown in heroic nudity. The body would be that of a young athlete that included chiseled muscles and a naturalistic pose. The face is generic, displaying no emotion. Some scholars believe that Doryphoros represented a young Achilles on his way to battle in the Trojan War, while others believe that there is confusion whether the sculpture is meant to depict a mortal or a hero. There have also been discussions on where these sculptures would be located during high Classical period, depending on where they were discovered. For example, the copy in Naples was found in the municipal Gymnasium of Pompeii, which leads us to believe that one may have been placed near fitness programs of the youth. Copies were also common for patrons to place in or outside their home.\nThe canonic proportions of the male torso established by Polykleitos ossified in Hellenistic and Roman times in the muscle cuirass, exemplified by the Augustus of Prima Porta, who wears ceremonial dress armour modelled in relief over an idealised muscular torso which is ostensibly modelled on the Doryphoros. The same depiction has the legs of the emperor arranged in the same manner as the stance of the Doryphoros.\nAnother example of the influence the Doryphoros had on sculpture much later than its initial conception can be seen in Michelangelo's David, now located in the Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence. The contrapposto style, idealised youthful male nudity, and overall antiquitical inspiration all show echoes of Polykleitos' Doryphoros. There is a chance however that the David was not so much designed with the Doryphoros in mind specifically, but the wider style contrappostic proportioning of which Polykleitos spread as a result of his work, as seen in the aforementioned Prima Porta statue, or with the statue of the Apollo Belvedere.", "hasanswer": false}]}

French was already famous for his 1874 The Minute Man statue in Concord, Massachusetts, and other works such as his 1884 John Harvard statue. He was also the personal choice of Bacon, who had already been collaborating with him for nearly 25 years. French resigned his chairmanship of the Fine Arts Commission in Washington, D.C. \u2014 a group closely affiliated with the memorial's design and creation \u2014 and commenced work in December.\n\nFrench had already created (1909\u20131912) a major memorial statue of Lincoln\u2014this one standing\u2014for the Nebraska State Capitol (Abraham Lincoln, 1912) in Lincoln, Nebraska. His previous studies of Lincoln\u2014which included biographies, photographs, and a life mask of Lincoln by Leonard Volk done in 1860\u2014had prepared him for the challenging task of the larger statue. He and Bacon decided that a large seated figure would be most appropriate for the national memorial. French started with a small clay study and subsequently created several plaster models, making subtle changes in the figure's pose or setting. He placed Lincoln not in an ordinary 19th-century seat but in a classical chair, including fasces, a Roman symbol of authority, to convey that the subject was an eminence for all the ages.\n\nThree plaster models of the Lincoln statue are at French's Chesterwood Studio, a National Trust Historic Site in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, including a  plaster sketch (1915) and a six-foot plaster model (1916). The second of French's plasters, created at Chesterwood in the summer of 1916 (inscribed October 31), became the basis of the final work, which was initially envisioned as a 12-foot (3.7 m) bronze. In deciding the size of the final statue, French and Bacon took photographic enlargements of the model to the memorial under construction. Eventually, French's longtime collaborators, the firm of Piccirilli Brothers, were commissioned to do the carving of a much larger sculpture in marble from a quarry near Tate, Georgia.\nFrench's design took a year to transfer to the massive marble blocks. French provided finishing strokes in the carvers' studio in The Bronx, New York City and after the statue was assembled in the memorial on the National Mall in 1920. Lighting the statue was a particular problem. In creating the work, French had understood that a large skylight would provide direct, natural illumination from overhead, but this was not included in the final plans. The horizontal light from the east flattened Lincoln's facial features\u2014making him appear to stare blankly rather than wear a dignified expression\u2014and highlighted his shins. French considered this a disaster. In the end, an arrangement of electric lights was devised to correct this situation.

The series revolves around teenagers who are amateur sleuths, solving cases that stumped their adult counterparts. The characters were created by American writer Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of book packaging firm Stratemeyer Syndicate. The books were written by several ghostwriters, most notably Leslie McFarlane, under the collective pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon.The Hardy Boys have evolved since their debut in 1927. From 1959 to 1973, the first 38 books were extensively revised, largely to remove depictions of ethnic stereotypes; they were also targeted towards younger readers by being rewritten in a simpler, action-oriented style to compete with television.\nA new Hardy Boys series, the Hardy Boys Casefiles, was created in 1987, and featured murders, violence, and international espionage. The original \"Hardy Boys Mystery Stories\" series ended in 2005. A new series, Undercover Brothers, was launched the same year, featuring updated versions of the characters who narrate their adventures in the first person. Undercover Brothers ended in 2012 and was replaced in 2013 by The Hardy Boys Adventures, also narrated in the first person.\nThrough these changes the characters have remained popular; several new volumes are published each year, and the adventures have been translated into over 25 languages. The boys have been featured in five television shows and several video games, and have helped promote merchandise such as lunchboxes and jeans. Critics have many explanations for the characters' longevity, suggesting that the Hardy Boys embody wish fulfillment, American ideals of boyhood and masculinity, a well-respected father paradoxically argued to be inept in the later books, and the possibility of the triumph of good over evil.On January 1, 2023, the original editions of the first three books entered the public domain in the United States.

It is one of Moore's earliest sculptures in two pieces, a mode that he started to adopt in 1959. Its form was inspired by the shape of a bone fragment. Moore created the sculpture from an edition of 10 working models in 1962; these working models are now in public collections. Moore created four full-size casts between 1962 and 1965, with one retained by him. The three casts are on public display on College Green in Westminster, London; Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver; and the garden at Kykuit, the house of the Rockefeller family in Tarrytown, New York.

{"id": "170_545", "question": "Who was Perl created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_15598", "text": "Perl has many and varied applications, compounded by the availability of many standard and third-party modules.\nPerl has chiefly been used to write CGI scripts: large projects written in Perl include cPanel, Slash, Bugzilla, RT, TWiki, and Movable Type; high-traffic websites that use Perl extensively include Priceline.com, Craigslist, IMDb, LiveJournal, DuckDuckGo, Slashdot and Ticketmaster. \nIt is also an optional component of the popular LAMP technology stack for Web development, in lieu of PHP or Python. Perl is used extensively as a system programming language in the Debian Linux distribution.Perl is often used as a glue language, tying together systems and interfaces that were not specifically designed to interoperate, and for \"data munging\", that is, converting or processing large amounts of data for tasks such as creating reports. In fact, these strengths are intimately linked. The combination makes Perl a popular all-purpose language for system administrators, particularly because short programs, often called \"one-liner programs\", can be entered and run on a single command line.Perl code can be made portable across Windows and Unix; such code is often used by suppliers of software (both COTS and bespoke) to simplify packaging and maintenance of software build- and deployment-scripts.Perl/Tk and wxPerl are commonly used to add graphical user interfaces to Perl scripts.\nPerl's text-handling capabilities can be used for generating SQL queries; arrays, hashes, and automatic memory management make it easy to collect and process the returned data. For example, in Tim Bunce's Perl DBI application programming interface (API), the arguments to the API can be the text of SQL queries; thus it is possible to program in multiple languages at the same time (e.g., for generating a Web page using HTML, JavaScript, and SQL in a here document). The use of Perl variable interpolation to programmatically customize each of the SQL queries, and the specification of Perl arrays or hashes as the structures to programmatically hold the resulting data sets from each SQL query, allows a high-level mechanism for handling large amounts of data for post-processing by a Perl subprogram.\nIn early versions of Perl, database interfaces were created by relinking the interpreter with a client-side database library. This was sufficiently difficult that it was done for only a few of the most-important and most widely used databases, and it restricted the resulting perl executable to using just one database interface at a time.In Perl 5, database interfaces are implemented by Perl DBI modules. The DBI (Database Interface) module presents a single, database-independent interface to Perl applications, while the DBD (Database Driver) modules handle the details of accessing some 50 different databases; there are DBD drivers for most ANSI SQL databases.DBI provides caching for database handles and queries, which can greatly improve performance in long-lived execution environments such as mod_perl, helping high-volume systems avert load spikes as in the Slashdot effect.In modern Perl applications, especially those written using web frameworks such as Catalyst, the DBI module is often used indirectly via object-relational mappers such as DBIx::Class, Class::DBI or Rose::DB::Object that generate SQL queries and handle data transparently to the application author.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hyde did not know he had a sister until season 7. Angie graduated from college as a mathematics major. Angie and Hyde worked together managing their father's record store, but Angie did not always like working with him. She dated Kelso, which sometimes annoyed Hyde. Angie got her name because all season 7 episodes were named after Rolling Stones songs, and \"Angie\" was a song by the Stones.\nAnnette Berkardt (played by Jessica Simpson) was Kelso's girlfriend for a brief period of time in season 5. She acts and talks very similar to Jackie, constantly bossing Kelso around. Eric and Donna once referred to her as a blonde version of Jackie, or \"Blackie.\" Despite this, Jackie and Annette hated each other. Once at The Hub, Jackie said to Annette \"I did not know they let 'slutballs' in here\". Annette said since she saw Jackie in there she thought it was okay. Later in the episode, when Annette and Kelso were kissing, Jackie yelled \"Get off my boyfriend!\" to Annette, even though it was months after Kelso and Jackie broke up. This led to Hyde wanting to break up with Jackie. After Hyde and Jackie both reconciled and seeing Kelso is still not over Jackie, Annette decides to break up with Kelso and go back home to California.\nBeatrice \"Bea\" Sigurdson (played by Betty White) is Kitty's mother. Bea seems like a friendly old lady but is cold and critical, especially of Kitty. She appeared in a few episodes in season five, often nagging at Burt or saying something rude to Kitty in a faux-friendly manner. She was widowed in \"Your Time is Gonna Come\" when Burt collapses in the driveway and is rushed to the hospital where he dies. She shows little emotion after her husband's death but Kitty does catch her crying in a bedroom. Bea stays with the Formans for a while after Burt's death, causing Kitty considerable stress.  She is mentioned as being deceased by the time of the first episode of That 90s Show. In the seventh episode of That 90s Show, Kitty mentions that they spread Bea's ashes outside a Sizzler restaurant.\nBernice Forman (played by Marion Ross) is Red's mother. Bernice resented Kitty and was always mean to her. Kitty revealed it was because Red married her instead of an attractive and wealthy woman he once dated who Bernice liked. She appeared in the episodes \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\", \"The Best Christmas Ever\" and \"Grandma's Dead\" of season 1, and in a flashback in the episode \"Halloween\" of season two. In the episode \"Grandma's Dead\" she dies in Eric's car while he is driving her home after Eric tells her off for her treatment of his mother.\nBrooke Rockwell (played by Shannon Elizabeth) was the valedictorian of the high school class two years before Eric's class. The summer after Kelso's graduation, she had sex with him at a Molly Hatchet concert in a bathroom stall and got pregnant. Initially, Brooke did not trust Kelso because of his immaturity and did not want him in the child's life. Eventually, Kelso convinced her to give him another chance. Brooke gave birth to their daughter Betsy in 1979.\nBurt Sigurdson (played by Tom Poston) is Kitty's father. He is often seen avoiding his wife, Bea. In one episode, he bought an ostrich farm, which was right next to a coyote farm. The coyotes ate all the ostriches and the Sigurdsons had to sell the house. Burt died in the driveway on the episode \"Your Time is Gonna Come\". He is later mentioned in the eighth episode of That 90s Show to have given Kitty beer when she was ten.\nCaroline \"Crazy Caroline\" Dupree (played by Allison Munn) was Fez's girlfriend in season 3. Fez quickly learned Caroline is very jealous and paranoid. She made threats against Donna and Jackie because Caroline felt they were going to steal Fez from her, when in fact Jackie and Donna had no intention of doing so. Caroline was once found hiding in the men's bathroom looking for Fez. Fez did not want to be with someone that aggressive and paranoid so he broke up with her. Fez and Caroline were together one last time in the eighth season. She got extremely angry when she found out that Fez had lied to her about Jackie being his roommate, and when she found nude photos of Donna in Fez's Barry White album (Leo hid the nude photos in the album without Fez's knowledge, but Caroline believed they were put there by Fez). Caroline appeared again in \"Sheer Heart Attack\". Fez was having sex with women once and not seeing them again and then decided that he wanted to be with only one woman, so he called Caroline. Later in the episode, Jackie told Fez that she loved him and then kissed him as Caroline walked in. This, as always, made Caroline angry with Fez and attack him viciously.\nCasey Kelso (played by Luke Wilson) is Kelso's brother who was in the military. Towards the end of season 4 he was dating Donna. During their relationship, there were instances of them engaging in bad behavior, such as Donna drinking and skipping school to hang out with Casey. Donna's father, Bob, felt that Casey was a bad influence and did not want Donna to date him anymore. Eric was jealous of Casey because he wanted to be with Donna, so Eric wanted them to break up. When Red, Kitty and Bob were discussing Casey's bad influence with Donna and Casey, Casey broke up with Donna, deciding the conflict with the adults to be too much hassle. Donna felt that she and Casey were in love, but Casey cruelly said \"I have this thing where I say stuff don't really mean.\" Kelso said that his brother got bored with his girlfriends and broke up with them. During the summer of 1979, Casey was teaching physical education at Eric's old high school, and Eric was in Casey's class. He likes to call Eric \"Foreplay\". His last appearance was in the Season 7 episode \"2120 So. Michigan Ave\". He is later mentioned in the season finale of That 90s Show when Donna tells Leia she dated him while broken up with Eric.\nCharlie Richardson (played by Bret Harrison) is the son of one of Red's war buddies. Eric held a grudge against him from the time that he let some sick children win \"Eric's\" goldfish in an egg toss. Charlie only appeared in about three episodes towards the end of season 7. Before the beginning of season 8, Charlie accidentally fell off the water tower and died. The water tower is named the Charlie Richardson Memorial Water Tower in his honor. The show originally planned to have Charlie stay the entire 8th season as a replacement for Eric, but killed Charlie off because Harrison got an offer to star in The Loop.\nChristine St. George (played by Mary Tyler Moore) is a talk show host of What's Up Wisconsin. In the episode \"Sweet Lady\", Jackie felt she was destined to be Christine's co-host on the show. She persistently tries to get the job, but Christine St. George makes Jackie her assistant instead. After a few episodes, Jackie was fired for knowing too much about her.\nEarl Arthur (played by Bob Clendenin) is a friend of Red's who worked for Red at Price Mart. Earl frequently came to work late and slacked off on his job, so Red fired him. In response Earl sued Red for wrongful termination, but the judge ruled in favor of Red when Earl arrived too late for his own hearing. Earl later got a job working at a fast food restaurant, where he is again fired for his poor work ethic (this time for repeatedly eating the restaurant's food while at work). Earl appears in the episodes \"Red Fired Up\", \"Roller Disco\" and \"Radio Daze\".\nEdna Hyde (played by Katey Sagal) is Hyde's biological mother. She is in the season 1 episodes \"Career Day\", \"Prom Night\", and \"Punk Chick\", only appearing on-screen in \"Career Day\". She plays a large part in \"Career Day\" as the school chef \"Gross Edna\", playing opposite Hyde when he has to help her in the kitchen on Career Day. In other episodes she only has lines yelling at Hyde on the porch from the inside of the house such as:\nIn Prom Night Edna: \"They're all gonna laugh at you!\" (a prom night reference to the 1976 film, Carrie) Steven: \"Shut up ma, you're makin' the night too damn special!\"\nIn Punk Chick Steven: \"It's still my suitcase!\" Edna: \"Nothing in this house is yours!\" Steven: \"Shut up!\"Edna then ran off and abandoned Hyde, not heard of again until the 4th season where Hyde claims that she and his stepfather Bud got back together and ran off. After Hyde's abandonment, Kitty prevailed upon Red to let the squalor-ridden Hyde live with the Formans.Fenton (played by Jim Rash) is someone with whom Fez has a feud due to a \"half-off sale, a crowded parking lot and a pair of pants that made Fez's ass look like an oil painting\" (in Fez's own words). In the fifth season, he was an employee at the jewelry store where Eric bought Donna's engagement ring. He is also the landlord of the apartment that Fez and Kelso moved into in the seventh season, which later became Fez and Jackie's apartment when Kelso moved to Chicago. At first, Fenton did not want to let Kelso and Fez move in because of his feud with Fez, but later when he found out Kelso wanted the apartment to have a place to take care of his daughter, and Fenton got the impression that Kelso and Fez were \"life partners\", he let them have it. Though Fenton does not state this explicitly, his frequent innuendos about men, his lack of experience with women, his mannerisms and affect overtly imply that he is gay. Whenever he sees Fez, he says \"Oh, it's you\" in a contemptuous way. Neither Fenton nor Fez specifically explain the reason for their mutual hostility and dislike to Eric, despite his increasing curiosity. Fenton later becomes good friends with Jackie, who persuades him not to evict Fez and end their feud. However, very shortly thereafter she carelessly floods both their apartment and Fenton's apartment directly underneath after falling asleep while running the bathtub. He returns in the finale of That 90s Show, now Sherri's landlord, and reignites his rivalry with Fez. He also mentions that he now owns three houses, a duplex and a Dippin Dots. He is the only character who was not part of the main cast to make an appearance in That 90s Show.\nHilary Robinson (played by Lara Everly) is Fez's co-worker at the salon where Fez works in season 8. Fez tries to impress her by trying to look cool, which instead intimidates her. However, when Jackie explains to her who Fez really is, she falls in love with him.

Joanne works at the dog food factory and hires Eric to put coupons in the dog food bags. Eric eventually loses that job after Joanne breaks up with Bob.\nMitch Miller (played by Seth Green) is a student in the same class as Eric. Mitch has a feud with Fez and publishes a photo in the school newspaper of Fez and Kelso kissing each other. Mitch has a crush on Donna, and the two once went to a wedding.

Not wanting to fight, Mitch persuades Eric not to fight by offering him a French-made GI Joe called \"GI Jacques\". Mitch has a father, Charlie Miller, played by Fred Willard.\nNina Bartell (played by Joanna Canton) is a girlfriend of Fez in season 5 who works with him at the DMV. Fez loses his virginity to her but it goes badly, so she suggests they need to do it more often to get better. It turns out that the reason she's dating Fez was to anger her parents due to him being \"different\", They break up a while later because Nina thinks he is too needy.\nOfficer Kennedy (played by James Avery) is Kelso's training officer when he joins the police force. He appears mostly in the 6th season, playing a straight ace to the bumbling Kelso.\nPam Burkhart (played by Eve Plumb in season 1 and Brooke Shields in season 6) is the mother of Jackie who was dating Bob Pinciotti in season 6. Once a serious business lady, she flees to Mexico when Jackie's councilman father is arrested for bribery and embezzling $60,000.

She is mentioned in more episodes than she appears, mostly by Michael Kelso. She appears in the episodes \"Prom Night\", \"Romantic Weekend\", and \"It's a Wonderful life\". In \"Prom Night\", Michael takes Pam to the prom while temporarily broken up with Jackie. In \"Romantic Weekend\", Kelso is about to have sex with Pam but is unable to perform, telling his friends \"the buffer wouldn't buff.\" Pam tells the whole school, which causes everyone to tease Kelso.\nPastor Dave (played by Kevin McDonald), Pastor Dave is the local pastor at the church. He is overly cheerful and (incorrectly) thinks he is \"hip cand cool\", up to date with the trends. He is often greeted by Eric and his friends with deadpan voices, and they typically just agree with Dave in the hopes he'll go away. Dave is good friends with Kitty, who helps with the church fundraisers, and has an uneasy friendship with Red (mostly because Red is not used to having friends). His friendship with Red seems to have brought out a less-pure side of Dave, as he spends a day with Red watching football and drinking beer, and once even quit the church because he wanted to watch more football on Sundays (later rejoining as the pastor). He appears primarily in season 3 and 4, but has a few cameos in season 2.\nRhonda Tate (played by Cynthia Lamontagne) Often called \"Big Rhonda\" by her classmates, she is a recurring character during season 4 as Fez's girlfriend. When she and Fez are stuck in the school during a tornado they are about to have sex, but Rhonda changes her mind when the tornado ends. She breaks up with Fez after she chokes him after he wanted to get to third base, which came from bad advice from Casey Kelso. Like Fez, she loves candy. She treats Eric with relentless contempt but is genuinely fond of Fez. She also physically intimidated tiny Jackie by threatening to wrestle her after Jackie gets rude with her. The episode \"It's a Wonderful Life\" features an alternate timeline where Rhonda goes to the prom with Eric (in this timeline, Eric and Donna were never in a relationship), and they remain together until he dumps her. Eric mentions that the two only had sex three times. Later in the same episode she is seen at their 10-year reunion but now as a trim, beautiful, and sexy woman. Rhonda claims her new body came from being dumped by Eric, leading her to lose weight using Jane Fonda workout tapes before becoming a fitness instructor herself. She thanks him for this. It is also mentioned in the season 3 episode \"Kitty's Birthday\" that she was hit by a car but was apparently uninjured.\nRoy Keene (played by Jim Gaffigan) is the kitchen manager of the Holiday Hotel employing Eric, Hyde, and Kelso to work as waiters in the hotel's restaurant during seasons 5 and 6. The character serves as the replacement for Leo, who was written out during season 5. Hyde mentions that Roy is like a father figure since his father abandoned him. Roy has stated that his standards for food service are low, and he goes days without washing his hands. Roy served in the Vietnam War, once describing Eric as \"scrawny, but strong... like the Vietcong\". He suffers from serious trouble connecting to people. One time, he got the impression a woman was in love with him after she insulted him when he got her some butter, so he hid in her shower to surprise her with flowers. He once mentioned he was living with a woman but moved out when she found out he was living with her in secret. It is revealed in the season 6 episode \"A Legal Matter\" that he was a police cadet who was kicked out of the police academy for shooting a police horse.\nSamantha Hyde (played by Judy Tylor) is Hyde's wife during season 8. They got married while Hyde was drunk in Las Vegas. The two barely knew each other when they got married. Hyde did not even remember the wedding and did not know he was married until after Samantha came to Point Place to see Hyde. In the episode \"My Fairy King\", Hyde learned that Samantha was already married to someone else. After this, Hyde and Samantha's relationship ended.\nSchatzi is a Dachshund that Red gave Kitty in an attempt to make her happy. Schatzi was in several episodes of season 5, was absent for all of season 6, then returned for only one episode towards the beginning of season 7. Red claimed that his absence was due to hiding under the house because he was afraid of the garden hose. \"Schatzi\" is German and means \"little treasure\" or \"darling\" (diminutive of \"Schatz\"). In the eighth episode of That 90s Show, Kitty mentions that they don't have a dog anymore, confirming that Schatzi is either dead or no longer lives with the Formans.\nSteven James \"Bud\" Hyde Sr. (played by Robert Hays) is Hyde's stepfather. Bud Hyde worked as a bartender and is an alcoholic. Until the end of the 6th season, Hyde thought Bud was his biological father. Bud abandoned Hyde when he was a child and Steven was always angry at Bud for this. They temporarily reconciled in season 3, with Hyde even moving in with him. However, he would leave again at the beginning of season 4 after getting back together with Edna \u2013 forcing Hyde to move back to the Forman house. Hyde mentioned that Bud did attempt to get in touch with him again. (Bud was passed out drunk on Hyde's car.)\nSuzy Simpson (played by Alyson Hannigan) appears in two episodes of season 6. She is Kelso's buddy from the police academy who is also attracted to him. Fez has a crush on Suzy and it is because of her that he and Kelso fight after Kelso lies to Fez saying that Suzy has agreed to go on a date with him when really she thinks that she is dating Kelso.

Barnett put Hyde in charge of the Point Place record store along with his daughter (and Hyde's half sister), Angie. Barnett is an African American, which Hyde believes explains his \"coolness, afro and suspicion of The Man\" (it can also be noted that when Hyde asked him who killed Kennedy his father stated \"I don't know, because they don't want me to know\").

Restriction site data must include the number of enzymes as well.\nNames are limited to 10 characters by default and must be blank-filled to be of that length and followed immediately by the character data using one-letter codes, although the 10 character limit name can be changed by a minor modification of the code (by changing nmlngth in phylip.h and recompiling). All printable ASCII/ISO characters are allowed names, except for parentheses (\"(\" and \")\"), square brackets (\"[\" and \"]\"), colon (\":\"), semicolon (\";\") and comma (\",\").  The spaces embedded in the alignment are ignored.\nMany programs for phylogenetic analyses, including the commonly-used RAxML and IQ-TREE programs, use the phylip format or a minor modification of that format called the relaxed phylip format.\nRelaxed phylip format (sequential):\n\n5 42 \nTurkey                  AAGCTNGGGCATTTCAGGGTGAGCCCGGGCAATACAGGGTAT \nSalmo_schiefermuelleri  AAGCCTTGGCAGTGCAGGGTGAGCCGTGGCCGGGCACGGTAT \nH_sapiens               ACCGGTTGGCCGTTCAGGGTACAGGTTGGCCGTTCAGGGTAA \nChimp                   AAACCCTTGCCGTTACGCTTAAACCGAGGCCGGGACACTCAT \nGorilla                 AAACCCTTGCCGGTACGCTTAAACCATTGCCGGTACGCTTAA\n\nThe primary difference in relaxed phylip format is the absence of the 10 character limit and the removal of the need to blank fill names to reach that length (although filling names to start the character matrix at the same position can improve readability for user). This example of relaxed uses underscores rather than spaces in the names and uses spaces between the names and the aligned character data; it is often good practice to avoid white space within taxon names and to separate the character data from the name when generating files.

Written in the key of C major, the chord progression of C, F, G, A minor, F matches those referenced in the song's famous first verse.When at age 50 Cohen first recorded the song, he described it as \"rather joyous\", and said that it came from \"a desire to affirm my faith in life, not in some formal religious way, but with enthusiasm, with emotion.\" He later said \"there is a religious hallelujah, but there are many other ones. When one looks at the world, there's only one thing to say, and it's hallelujah\". Journalist Larry Sloman, who knew Cohen well and interviewed him often, described the song as one part biblical, one part the woman that Cohen slept with last night, citing an unidentified critic saying that Cohen was most interested in \"holiness and horniness\".\n\nHis original version, recorded on his 1984 album Various Positions, contains allusions to several biblical verses, including the stories of Samson and Delilah from the Book of Judges (\"she cut your hair\") as well as King David and Bathsheba (\"you saw her bathing on the roof, her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you\").Cohen's lyrical poetry and his view that \"many different hallelujahs exist\" is reflected in wide-ranging covers with very different intents or tones, allowing the song to be \"melancholic, fragile, uplifting [or] joyous\" depending on the performer: The Welsh singer-songwriter John Cale, the first person to record a cover version of the song (in 1991), promoted a message of \"soberness and sincerity\" in contrast to Cohen's dispassionate tone; the cover by Jeff Buckley, an American singer-songwriter, is more sorrowful and was described by Buckley as \"a hallelujah to the orgasm\"; Crowe interpreted the song as a \"very sexual\" composition that discussed relationships; Wainwright offered a \"purifying and almost liturgical\" interpretation; and Guy Garvey of the British band Elbow made the hallelujah a \"stately creature\" and incorporated his religious interpretation of the song into his band's recordings. Noting its inclusion in the 2001 animated movie Shrek and performance in numerous singing competition reality shows, New York Times movie reviewer A. O. Scott wrote that \"Hallelujah is one of those rare songs that survives its banalization with at least some of its sublimity intact\".Canadian singer k.d. lang said in an interview shortly after Cohen's death that she considered the song to be about \"the struggle between having human desire and searching for spiritual wisdom. It's being caught between those two places.\" Former Barenaked Ladies frontman Steven Page, who sang the song at Canadian politician Jack Layton's funeral, described the song as being \"about disappointing [other] people\".\n\nThe song was the subject of a 2012 book, The Holy or the Broken: Leonard Cohen, Jeff Buckley & the Unlikely Ascent of 'Hallelujah'; author Alan Light said that Cohen's \"approach to language and craft feel unlike the work of anybody else. They sound rooted in poetry and literature because he studied as a poet and a novelist first.\" The book served as the basis for the 2022 documentary film Hallelujah: Leonard Cohen, A Journey, A Song; the film's co-creator said that Cohen \"addressed the deepest of our human concerns about longing for connection and longing for some sort of hope, transcendence and acknowledgment of the difficulties of life.\"Financial Times arts and culture columnist Enuma Okoro wrote that \"the lyrics and the tone of the song seem to sway between hymn and dirge, two musical forms that could serve as responses to almost everything that happens in our lives: songs that celebrate and acknowledge the blessings and provisions of our lives, and songs that bemoan our losses, our heartbreaks, and our deaths\". Okoro noted that the word hallelujah is composed of two Hebrew words that mean \"praise God\", adding that Cohen said people have been \"singing it for thousands of years to affirm our little journey\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The scene is based on the mythological princess Dana\u00eb, as \u2013 very briefly \u2013 recounted by the Roman poet Ovid, and at greater length by Boccaccio.  She was isolated in a bronze tower following a prophecy that her firstborn would eventually kill her father. Although aware of the consequences, Dana\u00eb was seduced and became pregnant by Zeus (in Roman mythology Jupiter), who, inflamed by lust, descended from Mount Olympus to seduce her in the form of a shower of gold.\nThough the composition, especially the main figure, is essentially the same, the six or more versions vary considerably. The major surviving versions are in Naples, London, Madrid, Vienna, Chicago, and St. Petersburg.  The voluptuous figure of Dana\u00eb, with legs half spread, hardly changes, and was probably traced from a studio drawing or version.  Her bed and its hangings are another constant.  Other elements vary considerably; the first version, now in Naples, was painted between 1544\u201346, and is the only one with a figure of Cupid at the right, rather than an old woman catching the shower of gold.  She is a different figure at each appearance, though the pose in the Hermitage follows the Prado version.  The small dog resting at Dana\u00eb's side in the Prado and Chicago versions is generally absent.\nThe works influenced the compositions of many artists including Rembrandt, Anthony van Dyck and Gustav Klimt, who all painted versions of the scene. Giorgio Vasari recounts a visit with Michelangelo to Titian's studio, where they saw the original in progress.

Additionally levels were changed to an exclusively grade-based system, A new level, Girl Scout Ambassadors, was created for girls in grades 11 and 12. Sixth grade girls were reclassified from Junior level to Cadette level in order to conform with the broad reclassification of 6th grade as a middle school grade.

She was the second child and first daughter of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark and his first consort, the former Princess Louise of Great Britain, and was named for her grandmother, Queen Sophie Magdalene. She received her own royal household at birth.\nJust one month after her birth, her grandfather King Christian VI died, and Princess Sophie Magdalene's father ascended the throne as King Frederick V. She was the heir presumptive to the throne of Denmark from the death of her elder brother in 1747 until the birth of her second brother in 1749, and retained her status as next in line to the Danish throne after her brother until her marriage. She was therefore often referred to as Crown Princess of Denmark.In the spring of 1751, at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, and she was brought up to be the Queen of Sweden. The marriage was arranged by the Riksdag of the Estates, not by the Swedish royal family. The marriage was arranged as a way of creating peace between Sweden and Denmark, which had a long history of war and which had strained relations following the election of an heir to the Swedish throne in 1743, where the Danish candidate had lost. The engagement was met with some worry from Queen Louise, who feared that her daughter would be mistreated by the Queen of Sweden, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. The match was known to be disliked by the Queen of Sweden, who was in constant conflict with the Parliament; and who was known in Denmark for her pride, dominant personality and hatred of anything Danish, which she demonstrated in her treatment of the Danish ambassadors in Stockholm.After the death of her mother early in her life, Sophia Magdalena was given a very strict and religious upbringing by her grandmother and her stepmother, who considered her father and brother to be morally degenerate. She is noted to have had good relationships with her siblings, her grandmother and her stepmother; her father, however, often frightened her when he came before her drunk, and was reportedly known to set his dogs upon her, causing in her a lifelong phobia.\nIn 1760, the betrothal was again brought up by Denmark, which regarded it as a matter of prestige. The negotiations were made between Denmark and the Swedish Queen, as King Adolf Frederick of Sweden was never considered to be of any more than purely formal importance. Louisa Ulrika favored a match between Gustav and her niece Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt instead, and claimed that she regarded the engagement to be void and forced upon her by Carl Gustaf Tessin. She negotiated with Catherine the Great and her brother Frederick the Great to create some political benefit for Denmark in exchange for a broken engagement. However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, who was very loved for her kindness and charity. This view was supported by the Caps political party, which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika. Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: \"His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen\". In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated.\nWhen a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: \"why Gustav, you seem to be already in love with her! She looks stupid\", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: \"She would suit you better!\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "170_569", "question": "Who was Alexander Hamilton created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "26_50570", "text": "In early 1780, Elizabeth went to stay with her aunt, Gertrude Schuyler Cochran, in Morristown, New Jersey, where she met Alexander Hamilton, one of Continental Army commander George Washington's aides-de-camp, who was stationed with Washington and his men in Morristown for the winter of 1780. Elizabeth and Hamilton had met once before, but only briefly, when Hamilton dined with the Schuylers on his way back from a negotiation on Washington's behalf. Also while in Morristown, Eliza met and became friends with Martha Washington, a friendship they maintained for the rest of their husbands' respective political careers. Eliza later said of Martha Washington, \"She was always my ideal of a true woman.\"After meeting Elizabeth in Morristown, Hamilton was so excited that he reportedly returned to the Continental Army's Morristown headquarters and had forgotten the password to gain admission to it. The relationship between Eliza and Hamilton quickly grew; even after he left Morristown a month later on a short mission to negotiate a prisoners exchange. While on the prisoner exchange, Hamilton wrote to Eliza, continuing their relationship through letters. \nAfter completing the prisoner exchange negotiations, Hamilton returned to Morristown, where Elizabeth's father had arrived in his capacity as representative of the Continental Congress. In some of the correspondence between Hamilton and Elizabeth, there had been some talk in at least one letter of a \"secret wedding\". In early April 1780, they were officially engaged with her father's blessing, which was something of an anomaly for the Schuyler girls with Elizabeth's two sisters, Angelica and Catherine, both eloping. \nHamilton followed the Continental Army when they decamped from Morristown in June 1780. In September that year, Eliza learned that Major John Andr\u00e9, head of the British Secret Service, had been captured in a foiled plot concocted by General Benedict Arnold to surrender the fort of West Point to the British. Andr\u00e9 was once been a house guest in the Schuyler Mansion in Albany as a prisoner of war en route to the Province of Pennsylvania in 1775; Eliza, then seventeen, might have had a juvenile crush on the young British officer who had once sketched for her. Hamilton, while envious of Andr\u00e9 for his actions during the war, promised Eliza he would do what he could to treat the British intelligence chief accordingly; he even begged Washington to grant Andr\u00e9's last wish of execution by firing squad instead of by hanging, but he was hanged to death despite the request. After two more months of separation punctuated by their correspondence, on December 14, 1780, Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler were married at the Schuyler Mansion.\nAfter a short honeymoon at the Pastures, Eliza's childhood home in Albany, New York, Hamilton returned to the Continental Army and the Revolutionary War in early January 1781. Eliza soon joined him in New Windsor, New York, where Washington's Continental Army was now stationed, and she rekindled her friendship with Martha Washington as they entertained their husbands' fellow officers. Soon, however, Washington and Hamilton had a falling out, and the newlywed couple moved, first back to Eliza's father's house in Albany, then to a new home across the river from the New Windsor headquarters. There, Eliza busied herself in creating a home for them and in aiding Alexander with his political writings, including parts of his 31-page letter to Robert Morris, in which Hamilton communicated his extensive understanding of government finance, which he later employed as the nation's first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury during Washington's presidency. Parts of the letter to Morris are in Eliza's handwriting.Soon, however, Eliza moved again, this time back to her parents' house in Albany. This may have coincided with the discovery that she was pregnant with their first child, who was born the following January and named Philip, in honor of Eliza's father. While apart, Alexander wrote her numerous letters assuring her not to worry for his safety; in addition, he wrote her concerning confidential military secrets, including the lead-up to the Battle of Yorktown that autumn. Meanwhile, the Revolutionary War began raging close to her home, when a group of British soldiers stumbled upon her residence at the Pastures, seeking supplies. According to some accounts, the family was spared from any losses thanks to her sister Peggy, who told the British soldiers that her father had gone to town to get help, which caused them to flee from the area.After the Battle of Yorktown, which was won decisively by American forces and led the British to recognize their defeat in the war, Alexander rejoined Eliza in Albany, where they remained for almost another two years prior to relocating to New York City in late 1783. Earlier that year, Angelica and her husband John Barker Church, for business reasons, moved to Europe. Angelica lived abroad for over 14 years, returning to the United States twice in 1785 and again in 1789. On September 25, 1784, Eliza gave birth to her second child, Angelica, named after Eliza's older sister.In 1787, Eliza sat for a portrait, painted by Ralph Earl while Earl was being held in debtors' prison. Alexander heard of Earl's predicament and asked if Eliza might be willing to sit for him, to allow him to make some money and eventually buy his way out of prison, which he subsequently did. At this time, she and Alexander had three young children; their third child, Alexander Jr., was born in May 1786, and she may have been pregnant then with their fourth child, James Alexander, who was born the following April.The same year, in 1787, Eliza and Alexander took into their home Frances (Fanny) Antill, the two-year-old youngest child of Hamilton's friend Colonel Edward Antill, whose wife had recently died. In October that year, Angelica wrote to Alexander, \"All the graces you have been pleased to adorn me with fade before the generous and benevolent action of my sister in taking the orphan Antle  [sic] under her protection.\" Two years later, Colonel Antill died in Canada, and Fanny continued to live with the Hamiltons for another eight years, until an older sister was married and able to take Fanny into her own home. Later, James Alexander Hamilton would write that Fanny \"was educated and treated in all respects as [the Hamiltons'] own daughter.\"The Hamiltons had an active social life, often attending the theater and various balls and parties. \"I had little of private life in those days,\" she would remember. At the first Inaugural Ball, Eliza danced with George Washington; when Thomas Jefferson returned from Paris in 1790, she and Alexander hosted a dinner for him. After Alexander became Treasury Secretary in 1789, her social duties increased. \"Mrs. Hamilton, Mrs. [Sarah] Jay and Mrs. [Lucy] Knox were the leaders of official society,\" an early historian wrote in 1897. She also managed the Hamilton household; James McHenry once noted to Alexander that Eliza had \"as much merit as your treasurer as you have as treasurer of the United States.\"Eliza also continued to aid Alexander throughout his political career, serving as an intermediary between him and his publisher when he was writing The Federalist Papers, copying out portions of his defense of the Bank of the United States, and sitting up with him so he could read Washington's Farewell Address out loud to her as he wrote it. Meanwhile, she continued to raise her children; a fifth child, John Church Hamilton, was born in August 1792. She maintained their household through multiple moves between New York City, Philadelphia, and Albany. \nWhile in Philadelphia, around November 24, 1794, Eliza suffered a miscarriage in the wake of her youngest child falling extremely ill and her worries over Alexander's absence during his armed suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Hamilton resigned from public office immediately afterwards in order to resume his law practice in New York and remain closer to his family.In 1797, an affair came to light that had taken place several years earlier between Hamilton and Maria Reynolds, a young woman who first approached Hamilton for monetary aid in the summer of 1791. Eliza evidently did not believe the charges when they were first leveled against her husband: John Church, her brother-in-law, on July 13, 1797, wrote to Hamilton that \"it makes not the least Impression on her, only that she considers the whole Knot of those opposed to you to be [Scoundrels].\" After returning home to Eliza on July 22 and assembling a first draft dated July 1797, on August 25, 1797, Hamilton published a pamphlet, later known as the Reynolds Pamphlet, admitting to his one-year adulterous affair in order to refute the charges that he had been involved in speculation and public misconduct with Maria's husband James Reynolds.Eliza was, at the time, pregnant with their sixth child. Despite her advanced pregnancy and her previous miscarriage of November 1794, her initial reaction to her husband's disclosure of his past affair was to leave Hamilton in New York and join her parents in Albany, where their son William Stephen was born on August 4, 1797. She returned to her marital house in New York City in early September 1797, in part because the local doctor had been unable to cure their eldest son Philip, who had accompanied her to Albany and contracted typhus. Eliza and Alexander reconciled and remained married, and had two more children together. The first, Elizabeth, named for Eliza, was born on November 20, 1799. Before their eighth child was born, however, they lost their oldest son, Philip, who died in a duel on November 24, 1801. After being shot on the dueling field, Philip was brought to Angelica and John Church's house, where he died with both of his parents next to him. Their last child, born the next June in 1802, was named Philip in his honor.\nDuring this time, Alexander commissioned John McComb Jr. to construct the Hamilton family home. In 1802, the same year that Philip was born, the house was built and named Hamilton Grange, after Alexander's father's home in Scotland. Eliza and Alexander continued to live together in a caring relationship in their new home that can be seen in letters between the two at the time. When Eliza went away attending her mother's funeral in 1803, Hamilton wrote to her from the Grange Estate, telling her:I am anxious to hear of your arrival at Albany and shall be glad to be informed that your father and all of you are composed. I pray you to exert yourself and I repeat my exhortation that you will bear in mind it is your business to comfort and not to distress.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It asserts that the universal wavefunction is objectively real, and that there is no wave function collapse. This implies that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements are physically realized in some \"world\" or universe. In contrast to some other interpretations, the evolution of reality as a whole in MWI is rigidly deterministic:\u200a9\u200a and local. Many-worlds is also called the relative state formulation or the Everett interpretation, after physicist Hugh Everett, who first proposed it in 1957. Bryce DeWitt popularized the formulation and named it many-worlds in the 1970s.In modern versions of many-worlds, the subjective appearance of wave function collapse is explained by the mechanism of quantum decoherence. Decoherence approaches to interpreting quantum theory have been widely explored and developed since the 1970s. MWI is considered a mainstream interpretation of quantum mechanics, along with the other decoherence interpretations, the Copenhagen interpretation, and hidden variable theories such as Bohmian mechanics.The many-worlds interpretation implies that there are most likely an uncountable number of universes. It is one of a number of multiverse hypotheses in physics and philosophy. MWI views time as a many-branched tree, wherein every possible quantum outcome is realized. This is intended to resolve the measurement problem and thus some paradoxes of quantum theory, such as Wigner's friend,:\u200a4\u20136\u200a the EPR paradox:\u200a462\u200a:\u200a118\u200a and Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, since every possible outcome of a quantum event exists in its own universe.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The physical appearance of Davros was developed by visual effects designer Peter Day and sculptor John Friedlander, who based Davros' chair on the lower half of a Dalek. Producer Philip Hinchcliffe told Friedlander to consider a design similar to the Mekon from the Eagle comic Dan Dare, with a large dome-like head and a withered body.Cast in the role of Davros was Michael Wisher, who had previously appeared in several different roles on Doctor Who and had provided Dalek voices in the serials Frontier in Space, Planet of the Daleks and Death to the Daleks. Wisher based his performance as Davros on the philosopher Bertrand Russell. In order to prepare for filming under the heavy mask, Wisher rehearsed wearing a paper bag over his head. Friedlander's mask was cast in hard latex, with only the mouth revealing Wisher's features; make-up artist Sylvia James shaded the mask's tones and blackened Wisher's lips and teeth to hide the transition.In the serial Destiny of the Daleks, Davros is played by David Gooderson using the mask Friedlander made for Wisher after it was split into intersecting sections to get as good a fit as possible. When Terry Molloy took over the role in Resurrection of the Daleks, a new mask was designed by Stan Mitchell.\nIn 2023, Bleach reprised the role of Davros for a minisode aired during Children in Need, informally titled \"Destination: Skaro\". For the first time on television, Davros is depicted as non-disabled. In an interview for Doctor Who: Unleashed, executive producer Russell T. Davies said that this is how Davros will be depicted in future appearances, to avoid contributing to harmful tropes of disabled villains in media.\n\"We had long conversations about bringing Davros back, because he's a fantastic character, [but] time and society and culture and taste has moved on. And there's a problem with the Davros of old in that he's a wheelchair user, who is evil. And I had problems with that. And a lot of us on the production team had problems with that, of associating disability with evil. And trust me, there's a very long tradition of this.\n\"I'm not blaming people in the past at all, but the world changes and when the world changes, Doctor Who has to change as well.\n\"So we made the choice to bring back Davros without the facial scarring and without the wheelchair \u2013 or his support unit, which functions as a wheelchair.\n\n\"I say, this is how we see Davros now, this is what he looks like. This is 2023. This is our lens. This is our eye. Things used to be black and white, they're not in black and white anymore, and Davros used to look like that and he looks like this now, and that we are absolutely standing by.\"\nThe decision to portray Davros without his chair received a divisive reception from fans.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Vroom was most known for his seascapes, which is why his views of Delft focus on the river Schie rather than the buildings of the town. Like Vermeer's painting, Fabritius's A View of Delft features the Nieuwe Kerk. This painting was likely meant to be seen in a perspective box through a peephole as a trompe l'\u0153il (trick of the eye), which would trick the viewer's eye into seeing a three-dimensional view of the street. Van der Poel's painting shows both the Nieuwe Kerk and the Oude Kerk, as well as the chapel of the hospital of St. George. The scene depicts the town after 40,000 kg of gunpowder exploded, killing hundreds of people including Carel Fabritius. Despite the devastation, the two churches still stand. Unlike other paintings of Delft which feature a busy harbour, Vermeer only painted a few boats. Vermeer also painted Delft from the south side instead of the more popular north side, as the south side was the only part of the town where buildings were left untouched by the Delft Thunderclap (explosion).", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "170_599", "question": "Who was Nikosthenic amphora created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_15806", "text": "A Nikosthenic amphora is a type of Attic vase invented in the late 6th century BC by the potter Nikosthenes, aimed specifically for export to Etruria. Inspired by Etruscan Bucchero types, it is the characteristic product of the Nikosthenes-Pamphaios workshop.\n\nCharacteristic features are the angular body of the amphora and the broad flat handles. The Etruscan predecessors were black-painted, whereas the Attic vases were decorated in the black-figure style. Nearly all know examples were found in Caere, while the majority of Nikosthenes products in other shapes were discovered in Vulci. This suggests that the type was specifically made for sale in or to Caere, which indicates that Nikosthenes must have been a gifted salesman and that an efficient system of intermediate traders must have existed. Niksothenes created or introduced several vase shapes, but the Nikosthenic amphora is his most famous innovation.\nThe clay of the Nikosthenic amphorae is bright orange-red, and thus provides a perfect base for black-figure vase painting. Their decoration follows quite varied patterns. Sometimes, they are subdivided in two or three separate friezes, mostly of plant and animal motifs. In other cases, images cover the whole vase body.\nApparently most, perhaps even all, Nikosthenic amphorae were painted by N Painter, which has been suggested to be identical with Nikosthenes. Production began around 530 to 520 BC and continued under Nikosthenes' successor Pamphaios \u2013 at that stage in the red-figure style \u2013 to cease between 500 and 490 BC.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The series centers on Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) and his friends and family, as he progresses from childhood to adulthood. Episodes chronicle the everyday events of Cory's home and school life; his teacher and neighbor George Feeny (William Daniels) delivers life lessons as Cory learns to cope with social and personal issues of adolescence. Cory has strong relationships with his older brother Eric (Will Friedle), younger sister Morgan (Lily Nicksay), and parents, Amy (Betsy Randle) and Alan (William Russ). Cory's friendship with Shawn Hunter (Rider Strong) and romantic interest in Topanga Lawrence (Danielle Fishel) serve as central focuses of episodes. Overarching themes include a focus on family and friendships as well as discovering one's identity. Further characters were introduced in later seasons; Jonathan Turner (Anthony Tyler Quinn), Eli Williams (Alex D\u00e9sert), Jack Hunter (Matthew Lawrence), Angela Moore (Trina McGee-Davis) and Rachel McGuire (Maitland Ward).\nThe Walt Disney Company commissioned the series for its youth-oriented TGIF programming block airing on ABC. Jacobs had previously produced Dinosaurs for the block and was asked to create a new series for a 12-to-14-year-old audience. Savage was under a contract with ABC at the time and Jacobs chose to include him as the central character. Boy Meets World was produced by Michael Jacobs Productions and Touchstone Television, and premiered on ABC on September 24, 1993. The series concluded on May 5, 2000, as a result of the aging cast and a shift in the network's programming directives.\nBoy Meets World experienced strong ratings for the teenage demographic throughout its seven seasons, and it was later syndicated on Disney Channel. Several cast members were nominated for Young Artist Awards. Savage and Fishel reprised their roles as series regulars in the spin-off Girl Meets World, which aired on Disney Channel from 2014 to 2017, and depicted Cory and Topanga as married parents.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "170_606", "question": "Who was Oscar Wilde's tomb created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_15819", "text": "The choice of Oscar Wilde's monument created controversy. Wilde's supporters would have liked for the monument to derive in some way from Wilde's works, such as \"The Young King\", by invoking homoerotica with figures of forlorn Greek youths, whereas Wilde's detractors believed he was deserving of no monument at all. One can see the influences of Wilde's works in Epstein's original sketches for the tomb, which feature two young men, heads downcast in an image of grief and sorrow upon an empty stone stele. However, Epstein has said of his sketches of the tomb that he \"was dissatisfied and scrapped quite completed work\".It has been suggested that the change in design plans are due to Epstein's new focus on Wilde's poem \"The Sphinx\". However, a number of influences began to play on Epstein around this period, including that of fellow sculptor Eric Gill. The two artists were deeply interested in what they saw as the more primal sexuality of Indian and Egyptian art, as opposed to British art. Pennington refers to this period in Epstein's work as the Sun Temple period and claims that, having been unable to follow this path with some of his works in Britain, Epstein transferred his new passion onto the Wilde tomb.The monument began as a 20-tonne block of Hopton Wood stone in Derbyshire, England, unveiled to the London press in June 1912. Epstein devised a vast winged figure, a messenger swiftly moving with vertical wings, giving the feeling of forward flight; the conception was purely symbolical, the conception of a poet as a messenger, but many people tried to read into it a portrait of Oscar Wilde.In the original sketches, the influences have been linked to the winged Assyrian bulls in the British Museum. The small angel figure behind the ear of the Sphinx may have been a deliberate reference by Epstein to the verse in Wilde's poem The Sphinx: \"sing me all your memories\". Upon the headdress there are five figures, one with a crucifix, perhaps symbolising the martyrdom of Oscar Wilde; this may be a recurring theme\u2014Epstein may have chosen the Sphinx with a crucified figure upon the headdress in reference to the sensual life choice of Wilde thinly veiled by his Catholicism. In Epstein's original sketchings there is a list of ten sins, however none are recognisable clearly on the final monument apart from the Egyptian-like helmet haircuts on the women.On the finished stone monument the small angel behind the ear has been removed and replaced by an elaborate headdress, the crucified figure and the phallic sphinx have been removed, and in their place is a personification of fame being trumpeted. This may have been Epstein landing on a less sentimental, carved and angular alternative.Whilst transporting the monument to the cemetery in France from his Cheyne Walk studios in London, Epstein ran into trouble with the police\u2014having rejected its status as a work of art, French customs placed a punishing import duty of \u00a3120 on the monument for the value of the stone. Once the bill was paid (it has been suggested that Robert Ross had borrowed the funds from Ada Leverson), the monument was covered with tarpaulin due to the Parisian officials' reaction to the monument's nudity. Epstein returned to the cemetery one evening and found that the testicles on the statue had been covered by plaster, as the size of the testicles was considered unusual. The monument was under police surveillance and Epstein found he could only continue his work upon it after bribing a police officer to look away, but the work was sporadic and the tarpaulin was replaced at night. Eventually, as compromise, under Robert Ross' instruction, a bronze plaque similar to the shape of a butterfly was placed upon the testicles of the monument and it was unveiled in early August 1914 by the occultist and poet Aleister Crowley. Epstein was furious that his work had been altered without his consent and refused to attend the unveiling. A few weeks later Aleister Crowley approached Epstein in a caf\u00e9 in Paris, and around his neck was a bronze butterfly\u2014he informed Epstein that his work was now on display as he intended.The testicles were removed in an act of vandalism in 1961. It is said that the cemetery manager used them as a paperweight. They are now missing. In 2000, Leon Johnson, a multimedia artist, installed a silver prosthesis to replace them.\nThe epitaph is a verse from The Ballad of Reading Gaol:", "hasanswer": false}]}

(The characters of Dimmock and Defraits may have been given the same initials to continue a play on words. Oldenshaw was sometimes identified as Edwin G. Oldenshaw. In the last episode, Oldenshaw and Defraits are in a park, feeding waterfowl, and the camera zooms in on their briefcases, bearing their initials: E.G.O. and I.D.).\nThe novelty of the series was that Oldenshaw and his colleagues never needed to leave their office in order to resolve cases, preferring to spend their time playing the board game of Go. They simply provided their prognosis and left the police to do the cleaning up. Different directors were often appointed to film the Room 17 and outside-world scenes independently, to maintain a sense of distance between the two worlds.\nThe rarefied nature of Oldenshaw's work was amplified in 1967 when he returned, re-united with Dimmock, in a new series, The Fellows (Late of Room 17). This series saw the pair relocated to All Saints College, Cambridge University, where they were appointed to the Peel Research Fellowship. Their research was (as it is stated in the series) \"to investigate the general proposition that, in a period of rapid social change, the nature of crime (and therefore criminals) would change\". Their research led them into encounters (though never physical) with gangland boss Alec Spindoe (Ray McAnally), who eventually ended up behind bars thanks, unknown to Spindoe, to psychological pressure from Oldenshaw. The Spindoe character was to return in his own series, Spindoe in 1968, which charted his attempts to regain his criminal empire after release from prison.\nAn episode of The Man in Room 17 - the series 2 opener 'How to Rob a Bank - And Get Away with it' was released on DVD in 2007 as a bonus feature for the complete series box set of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased).

For the first time in her career, Madonna co-wrote and co-produced all of the album's tracks. According to Leonard, she was \"very much in love\" and in control when creating the record. The singer worked with Bray and Leonard separately, with the three meeting together only once. Leonard recalled the recording process: \"I would put something together, usually just on piano, and then [Madonna] would come in, we'd mess around with whatever needed to be messed around with, she\u2019d write a lyric, she\u2019d sing it, and the next day we would do another song, one a day\". On the other hand, Bray's job was to \"shape things and [...] create arrangements to show off the song[s] better\".  \"Open Your Heart\" was the first track recorded for the album; it was created as a rock and roll song titled \"Follow Your Heart\" by Gardner Cole and Peter Rafelson for singer Cyndi Lauper. Madonna's team got a demo with songs from Cole's management, among them \"Follow Your Heart\"; she liked the track, changed the title, re-wrote some of the lyrics, and produced it alongside Leonard. They added a bassline underneath, changing it from a rock song into a dance one.\"Papa Don't Preach\" was written by Brian Elliott for a singer named Cristina Dent. When Elliot played Dent's tracks for Warner's Michael Ostin, the same A&R executive who discovered \"Like a Virgin\", Ostin asked if he could play the track for Madonna; Elliot had been working with Dent for six months and was reluctant to let the song go to another artist, but he eventually gave in, finding the idea of Madonna recording his song \"hard to resist\". With lyrics that talk about teenage pregnancy, Madonna was attracted to the track because it \"fit right in with my own personal zeitgeist of standing up to male authorities\". She only contributed with additional lyrics, making \"Papa Don't Preach\" the only song on the album that she did not have a strong hand in writing. \"La Isla Bonita\" marked a \"stylistic shift\" for Madonna, as it's her first song to incorporate Latin motifs, and lyrics in Spanish.  It was created by Leonard as an instrumental and offered to Michael Jackson, who turned it down. After meeting with the singer to start working on True Blue, Leonard presented her the demo and she wrote the lyrics while filming Shanghai Surprise. To get the correct translations, he and Madonna talked over the phone with a Hispanic housekeeper. It was described as a tribute to \"the beauty and mystery of Latin American people\". \"Where's the Party\" is the only track that saw Madonna, Bray and Leonard working together.

{"id": "170_619", "question": "Who was Leopold Bloom created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_15860", "text": "Bloom is introduced to the reader as a man of appetites:\n\nMr. Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. But most of all, he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.\n\nThe Bloom character, born in 1866, is the only son of Rudolf Vir\u00e1g (a Hungarian Jew from Szombathely who emigrated to Ireland, converted from Judaism to Protestantism, changed his name to Rudolph Bloom and later died by suicide), and of Ellen Higgins, an Irish Catholic. He is uncircumcised. They lived in Clanbrassil Street, Portobello. Bloom converted to Catholicism to marry Marion (Molly) Tweedy on 8 October 1888. The couple has one daughter, Millicent (Milly), born in 1889; their son Rudolph (Rudy), born in December 1893, died after 11 days. The family lives at 7 Eccles Street in Dublin.\nEpisodes (chapters) in Ulysses relate a series of encounters and incidents in Bloom's contemporary odyssey through Dublin in the course of the single day of 16 June 1904 (although episodes 1 to 3, 9 and to a lesser extent 7, are primarily concerned with Stephen Dedalus, who in the plan of the story is the counterpart of Telemachus). Joyce aficionados celebrate 16 June as 'Bloomsday'.\nAs the day unfolds, Bloom's thoughts turn to the affair between Molly and her manager, Hugh 'Blazes' Boylan (obliquely, through, for instance, telltale ear worms), and, prompted by the funeral of his friend Paddy Dignam, the death of his child, Rudy. The absence of a son may be what leads him to take a shine to Stephen, for whom he goes out of his way in the book's latter episodes, rescuing him from a brothel, walking him back to his own house, and even offering him a place there to study and work. The reader becomes familiar with Bloom's tolerant, humanistic outlook, his penchant for voyeurism and his (purely epistolary) infidelity. Bloom detests violence, and his relative indifference to Irish nationalism leads to disputes with some of his peers (most notably 'the Citizen' in the Cyclops chapter). Although Bloom has never been a practicing Jew, converted to Roman Catholicism to marry Molly, and has in fact received Christian baptism on three occasions, he is of partial Jewish descent and is sometimes ridiculed and threatened because of his being perceived as a Jew.Richard Ellmann, Joyce's biographer, described Bloom as \"a nobody\", who \"has virtually no effect upon the life around him\".  In this Ellmann found nobility: \"The divine part of Bloom is simply his humanity - his assumption of a bond between himself and other created beings.\"Hugh Kenner took issue with the view of Bloom as \"the little man\", citing textual evidence to show that he is taller than average. He also has \"relative wealth, an exalted dwelling-place, handsome features, a polysemous wit, a famously beautiful wife\". Kenner admitted that the evidence came late in the text. He argued that Joyce gave the initial impression of Bloom's ordinariness because of the parallel with Ulysses, whose \"normal strategy was to withhold his identity\".\nOthers such as Joseph Campbell see him more as an Everyman figure, a world (cosmopolis) traveler who, like Homer's Odysseus \"visited the dwellings of many people and considered their ways of thinking\" (Odyssey 1.3).\nOne critic has argued that Joyce used the doctrines of the Incarnation cited early in Ulysses to characterize his relation to both Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom and their relation to each other. The theme of \u201creincarnation,\u201d also introduced early in the novel, has been linked to one of the doctrines to signify that Bloom is the mature Joyce in another form and that Joyce speaks through him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Mancuso Jr. was afraid that mentioning any events from the films would take the audience away from \"the new world that we were trying to create\". The decision to name the show Friday the 13th, over the original title, was made because Mancuso Jr. believed a \"Friday the 13th\" moniker would better help to sell the show to networks. Filming took place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Friday the 13th: The Series aired in first-run syndication, initially in a late-night spot; the success of the series as a late-night show prompted some broadcasting stations to move it to prime time.

Megatokyo debuted on August 14, 2000, and has been written and illustrated solely by Gallagher since July 17, 2002. Gallagher's style of writing and illustration is heavily influenced by Japanese manga. Megatokyo is freely available on its official website.  The intended schedule for updates was for postings twice a week, but new comics are typically posted just once or twice a quarter on non-specific days. In 2011, updates began being delayed further due to the health issues of Sarah Gallagher (Seraphim), Gallagher's wife. Megatokyo was published in book-format by CMX, although the first three volumes were published by Dark Horse.

They were, however, able to purchase the stage rights to the short story on which All About Eve had been based, Mary Orr's \"The Wisdom of Eve\". The resulting musical could not contain any dialogue or characters that had been created for the movie but could use the original material that the movie also used. In April 1969, it was announced that Strouse, Adams, and book writer Sidney Michaels were beginning to work on the show, with Lawrence Kasha and Joseph Kipness producing. In July 1969, movie star Lauren Bacall was cast as aging theater star Margo Channing, the role played by Bette Davis in All About Eve. Bacall greatly identified with the role, explaining, \"The Margo Channing of Applause and myself were ideally suited. She was approaching middle age.  So was I. She was being forced to face the fact that her career would have to move into another phase as younger women came along to do younger parts.  So was I.  And she constantly felt that the man she was in love with was going to go off with someone else, someone younger of course, and I, too, had had those feelings\".Bacall, Strouse, Adams, and Kasha came to the conclusion that Michaels' book was insufficient, so Kasha hired Betty Comden and Adolph Green to write a new book. They updated the story so that it was set in the present day (1970) instead of the 1950 setting of All About Eve. Comden and Green also created new characters to replace the characters created specifically for the movie. Addison de Witt, the snide and articulate drama critic played in the film by George Sanders, was replaced by Howard Benedict, producer of the play in which Margo Channing is appearing. Margo's loyal assistant Birdie Coonan, the only character in the film who is suspicious of Eve from the start, was replaced by Duane Fox, Margo's gay hair stylist. Strouse commented that this change also made the show more relevant to the 1970s. (A memorable moment: Margo asks Duane, \"Are you going to be her hairdresser too?\" Duane's response: \"Only when she's laid out!\") At a later point, Twentieth Century Fox reversed its original decision and granted the musical's creators full rights to All About Eve's script; however, by that time, the show was so far along in its development that major changes could not be made to the book.

It is sometimes called the Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier or the Wicklow Terrier, and the name of the breed is often shortened by fanciers to just Glen.\nThe breed originates in, and is named for, the Glen of Imaal in County Wicklow, Ireland. It was recognised first by the Irish Kennel Club in 1934 and most recently by the American Kennel Club in 2004. The Canadian Kennel Club voted to fully recognize Glens in 2017 after the breed spent years on the Miscellaneous list; approval by Agriculture Canada is pending.\nReportedly, the Glen's history began during the reign of Elizabeth I, who hired French and Hessian mercenaries to put down a rebellion in Ireland. After the conflict, many of these soldiers settled in the Wicklow area. They brought with them their low-slung hounds, which they bred with the local terrier stock, eventually developing a distinctive breed that became known as the Glen of Imaal Terrier.Glens were originally used for eradicating other animals such as rat, fox, badger, and otter, and also as a general-purpose farm dog for herding and family companionship. Unlike many other terriers, they are \"strong dogs\" rather than \"sounders\"\u2014they were bred to work mute to ground, going silently into dens after their quarry rather than barking at it to alert their handlers. In hunting trials, which used to be required by many kennel clubs for championships, Glens were disqualified if they sounded at the quarry. For this reason, today they are among the quietest terriers.\n\nAccording to Irish lore, Glen of Imaal Terriers were also used as turnspit dogs to turn meat over fires for cooking. Evidence for this is scarce, and engravings of such dogs from the 19th century do not bear much resemblance to today's Glen. It is, however, repeated in many descriptions of the breed and often used in color commentary by dog show announcers.The breed almost died out before being revived in the early twentieth century by breeders in its homeland. Paddy Brennan Tinahely Co Wicklow, and Willie Kane Tipperary are recognised as two breeders that revived the breed. Today, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is still one of the rarest breeds of dog (in the US, living registered animals number in the hundreds) and the least-known Irish terrier breed. It is considered a vulnerable native breed by the UK's Kennel Club, which tracks breeds in which fewer than 300 puppies are registered each year.[1]\n\nThe current global Glen population size is estimated at 3100.[2]", "hasanswer": false}]}

The 22 episodes of the series were in first-run syndication between 1999 and 2000.\nThe drama series focused on the six survivors of a crashed airline flight in the Brazilian Amazon jungle.

Its English title is The Head of Barcelona.The sculpture was Lichtenstein's first outdoor work using ceramic tile. It is said to acknowledge Antoni Gaud\u00ed and Barcelona's affinity for mosaics.The sculpture stands tall on the waterfront in the heart of the city. Made out of concrete and ceramic, it is an abstract rendition of a woman's head and appears exactly how one would expect a Lichtenstein sculpture to be. Lichtenstein did not start experimenting with three-dimensional art until the late 1970s, and prior to this his main focus was on pop art. He mainly painted on large canvases and his paintings resembled comic-strip art; his signature use of bold primary colors, thick dark lines, thought bubbles containing context and sound effects, and dots used as a method of shading, can be seen in most of his works from 1961 and later, starting with his painting Look Mickey.\nAlthough it is very abstract, it is clear that the sculpture was made to resemble the head and face of a woman. It is made up of thick pieces of concrete completely covered in red, yellow, blue, black and white mosaic tiles, and from far away it looks like it could be a painting. The woman's eyes look like thick blue and black brush strokes; same with her nose, and her lips look like Lichtenstein could have used a quick stroke of bright red paint. The left third of her face, the side with the blue nose and eye, is covered with white tiles, while the right two thirds of her face is covered in a grid of red dots, typical of Lichtenstein's pop-art style. Lichtenstein added other artistic elements to this sculpture as well. Below her head, what would probably be considered the woman's neck, is a tall, flat stroke of blue and white that extends all the way up through her face and ends a few inches above her head. Perpendicular to the blue and white stroke is a stroke of yellow and black, beginning at the bottom and then reappearing at the top of her head.\nSimilar to his sculptures from the early eighties, specifically his Brushstrokes pieces, the entire sculpture looks like it could have been painted with a few quick strokes of paint. The difference between these earlier pieces and The Head of Barcelona is that his Brushstrokes pieces are created with painted aluminum while The Head is his only piece made out of concrete and covered in mosaic tiles. The reason for this difference in his sculptures is because The Head of Barcelona was built to resemble the style of Antoni Gaudi, a Catalan architect who is famous for employing organic lines and mosaic tiles throughout his architecture, and for which Barcelona is known.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Black Radical moved to 2-Bone Records to release \"Monsoon\" (2-Bone, 1989) before signing with UK label Mango Records. This led to the release of the single \"Rippin' Up The Industry\" (Mango Records, 1990) in which Black Radical let rip at the practices of the UK record industry \u2013 a typically uncompromising move from an artist who had just moved to one of the UK's biggest hip hop record labels.\nTwo further singles and his debut album followed: The Undiluted Truth: A Black Man's Leviathan (Mango Records, 1991) is widely regarded as Black Radical's best album and showcases his political and religious views. The song \"Sumarli\" expresses his belief that black men and women should only date members of their own race, whilst \"Sign of the Beast\" details an apocalyptic vision and makes reference to the Nation of Islam's belief that the white man was created out of genetic experiments on black men carried out by the scientist Yakub. The album was popular, but Black Radical's views also caused an angry reaction from many people \u2013 including his own record company, who unceremoniously dropped the artist after the album was released.\nBlack Radical took three years before he released his next single, \"This Iz War\" (Copasetic Records, 1993), which was a response to the Roland Adams murder. An album \u2013 Double Edged Sword: The Pre LP (Black Foundation, 1995) \u2013 followed, but whilst the artist's delivery and lyrics were still up to their old standard, the album failed to achieve the same success of his debut. The move to a small, independent record label and the widespread collapse of the British hip hop scene were partly to blame in keeping the record from its audience, although equally it has been suggested that the music and production missed the attention of the Mango producers.\nAgain, Black Radical moved labels before releasing his final (to date) album, Khaos & Konfusion: The Spell of Leviathan (Blueprint Records, 1998).

The Farnese family later acquired and renamed the villa, smaller than the more ostentatious palazzo at the other side of the Tiber. The fresco is a mythological scene of a series embellishing the open gallery of the building, a series never completed which was inspired by the \"Stanze per la giostra\" of the poet Angelo Poliziano. In Greek mythology, the beautiful Nereid Galatea had fallen in love with the peasant shepherd Acis. Her consort, one-eyed giant Polyphemus, after chancing upon the two lovers together, lobbed an enormous pillar and killed Acis \u2013 Sebastiano del Piombo produced a fresco of Polyphemus next to Raphael's work.\nRaphael did not paint any of the main events of the story. He chose the scene of the nymph's apotheosis (Stanze, I, 118\u2013119). Galatea appears surrounded by other sea creatures whose forms are somewhat inspired by Michelangelo, whereas the bright colors and decoration are supposed to be inspired by ancient Roman painting. At the left, a Triton (partly man, partly fish) abducts a sea nymph; behind them, another Triton uses a shell as a trumpet. Galatea rides a shell-chariot drawn by two dolphins.\nWhile some have seen in the model for Galatea the image of the courtesan, Imperia, Agostino Chigi's lover and Raphael's near-contemporary, Giorgio Vasari wrote that Raphael did not mean for Galatea to resemble any one human person, but to represent ideal beauty. When asked where he had found a model of such beauty, Raphael reportedly said that he had used \"a certain idea\" he had formed in his mind.\nIn a letter to Baldassare Castiglione, Raphael dictated via Pietro Aretino, that \"to paint a beauty, I should have to see a number of beauties, provided Your Lordship were with me to choose the best. But in the absence of good judges and beautiful forms, I use an idea that comes to my mind.\"Antonio Sgamellotti of the Lincei Academy and his colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of the blue pigment in the sea and sky of Triumph of Galatea. Sgamellotti said the researchers found evidence of Egyptian blue, a pigment thought to have been replaced after the fall of the Roman Empire with the use of lapis lazuli.

His mother is known only as Maw Pete and was mentioned in the story \"Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold\" by Carl Barks and Jack Hannah (first published October 1942) as a resident of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her only appearance was in \"The River Pirates\" (Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #336\u2013338, published September\u2013November 1968) by Carl Fallberg and Paul Murry. The same story introduced Li'l Pete, Black Pete's short fraternal twin brother. In December 1998, the Mickey Mouse comic strip introduced an older sister of Pete. Petula is the television host of the cooking show Petula's Pantry. She finds time, however, to seek revenge against Mickey for condemning her \"baby brother\" to life imprisonment.\nBetter-known and more enduring as characters are two figures created by Romano Scarpa for Italian Disney comics. The first, Trudy Van Tubb, was introduced in Topolino e la collana Chirikawa (published in English as The Chirikawa Necklace, first published on March 10, 1960). This female partner of Pete was presented as a childhood acquaintance of his: they are even shown as kids kidnapping Mickey when he was a baby. However, Trudy soon became Pete's girlfriend, his partner-in-crime and roommate\u2014whenever they hold residence out of prison, that is. Their relationship seems to have evolved to a long-standing common-law marriage. This is occasionally used in contrast to Mickey's eternal engagement to Minnie Mouse and Goofy's determination to remain a bachelor. Trudy and Pete also have two hellion nephews named Pierino and Pieretto who often serve as foils for Mickey or Mickey's nephews Morty and Ferdie.The second character to be created by Scarpa is Pete's cousin, the criminal scientist Portis (Plottigat in the original Italian version; English name first used in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories 695, 2008). Portis first appeared in Topolino e il Pippo-lupo (published in English as The Weregoof's Curse; January 9, 1977).Ed Nofziger is responsible for a third recurring character, an alternative girlfriend of Pete named Chirpy Bird. She first appeared in Topolino e i piccioni \"poliziotti\" (Mickey Mouse and the Pigeon Police, first published in December 1981) and starred as Pete's partner-in-crime in eight stories from 1981 to 1984.

Zeke is a criminal like Pete, but is wary of his cousin's attempts to double-cross him \"Just like old Times\". Mickey often uses this distrust to turn the two against one-another.\nIn Goof Troop, Pete has a wife, Peg, and two children, PJ and Pistol.

The article appeared to be a serious development of the idea, and Peano subsequently gained a reputation among the auxiliary language movement.\nIn 1904, Peano undertook an essay about the way to obtain the minimal grammar of an eventual minimal Latin (Latino minimo), with a minimal vocabulary purely international.Peano and some colleagues published articles in Latino sine flexione for several years at the Revue de Math\u00e9matiques.  Because of his desire to prove that this was indeed an international language, Peano boldly published the final edition of his famous Formulario mathematico in Latino sine flexione. However, as Hubert Kennedy notes, most mathematicians were put off by the artificial appearance of the language, and made no attempt to read it.In October 1907, Peano was at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in Paris to take part in the Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language. Having declared for Latino sine flexione to be adopted, he eventually could not participate in the final voting, because of labour affairs at Turin.On 26 December 1908, Peano was elected member and director of the Akademi internasional de lingu universal still using Idiom Neutral, which was refounded one year later under the name Academia pro Interlingua. Every academician might use their favourite form of Interlingua, the term being initially used in a general sense as a synonym for international language, yet it soon began to be specially used to denote a reformed Latino sine flexione based on the common rules the academicians were reaching by frequent votings. Thus, the name Interlingua soon began to denote the language evolving from the Academia Pro Interlingua, with the corresponding abbreviation IL.\nHowever, every member was free to write in their own personal style, and indeed some members were proposing radical reforms which eventually might end up as independent languages (like Michaux's Romanal or De Wahl's Interlingue). For this reason, the name Peano's Interlingua or Interlingua (IL) might be regarded as the most accurate for the particular standard by Peano. (As found in \"Interglossa and its predecessors\".)\nThe discussions to reach a standard Interlingua may be seen on the pages of Discussiones, the official journal of the Academia pro Interlingua from 1909 to 1913. This and subsequent journals of the academy have been recently published in a CD-Rom by the mathematics department of the University of Turin, the place where Peano developed his teaching and research.\nSince De Latino Sine Flexione had set the principle to take Latin nouns either in the ablative or nominative form (nomen was preferred to nomine), in 1909 Peano published a vocabulary in order to assist in selecting the proper form of every noun, yet an essential value of Peano's Interlingua was that the lexicon might be found straightforward in any Latin dictionary (by getting the thematic vowel of the stem from the genitive ending, that is: -a -o -e -u -e from -ae -i -is -us -ei).\nFinally, a large vocabulary with 14,000 words was published in 1915.A reformed Interlingua was presented in 1951 by Alexander Gode as the last director of the International Auxiliary Language Association. It was claimed to be independent from Peano's Interlingua, because it had developed a new method to detect the most recent common prototypes. But that method usually leads to the Latin ablative, so most vocabulary of Peano's Interlingua would be kept. Accordingly, the very name Interlingua was kept, yet a distinct abbreviation was adopted: IA instead of IL.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Both were at the service of Ana de Mendoza, Princess of Eboli, who was also the Duchess of Pastrana. Some historians believe that he trained with El Greco, but no documentary evidence has been found. It is known for certain that he spent the years 1600 to 1608 in Italy, where he became familiar with, and was influenced by, the works of Caravaggio and his students Orazio Gentileschi, Guido Reni and Annibale Carracci. When he returned to Pastrana, he revealed those influences in a \"Trinity\", painted for the side altar at the Monasterio de Concepcionistas Franciscanas.\nIn March 1611, he moved to Toledo and, the following year, painted an \"Altarpiece of the Four Days of Easter\" for the Dominicans, which is now at the Museo del Prado. It is, perhaps, his best known work. Also notable are canvases depicting the \"Adoration of the Magi\" and the \"Adoration of the Shepherds\".\nIn June 1613, he entered the Dominican Order and took up residence at the Monastery of San Pedro M\u00e1rtir. This reduced his artistic activity, although he created other versions of the \"Adoration of the Shepherds\", one of which is at the Hermitage in Saint Petersburg. Another may be seen at the Meadows Museum in Dallas.\nKing Philip III called him to his Court in 1620, to teach drawing to his son, the future King Philip IV. At that time, Ma\u00edno became a sponsor of the young Diego Vel\u00e1zquez; choosing him, in a contest, to paint an \"Expulsion of the Moors\", which helped establish him at court.

Frederick required his generals to set an example of courage and leadership: they led from the front. The same rate of attrition applied throughout the officer corps, which lost half of its strength in the first three campaigns of the war. In addition to human losses, they lost valuable horses and draft animals, 70 munitions wagons, and, a blow to morale, 28 flags, and two standards. On the positive side, Retzow's corps of about 6,000 men, which had not arrived in time to participate in the fighting, remained intact; Frederick had pulled his troops together for an orderly retreat; and the King retained the confidence of his soldiers.The Austrians suffered casualties and losses at about three percent. According to the Austrian historian Gaston Bodart, there were fewer troops participating than most modern sources suggest: he places Austrian participants at 60,000, losses in casualties at 5,400, approximately 8.3 percent, but other losses (to injuries, desertions and capture) at about 2,300, or 3.6 percent. They also lost three standards.  Some modern historians place the overall losses higher, at 7,300.  Notification of the battle arrived in Vienna during the celebration of the Empress's name day, to the delight of Maria Theresa and her court, gathered at Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace. Daun received a blessed sword and hat from Pope Clement XIII, a reward usually granted for defeating \"infidels\". The Empress eventually created an endowment of 250,000 florins for Daun and his heirs.For Daun and Lacy, it was a victory of mixed emotions; upon the discovery of Keith's body in the village church, they both broke down in tears of grief. Keith had been the best friend of Lacy's father during his service in Russia.  Similarly, the grief Frederick felt at the loss of one of his greatest friends was intense. His grief was added to when he learned a couple of days later that his beloved elder sister, Wilhelmine, who had shared their father's wrath in 1730 during the Katte affair, had died on the same day. He sulked in his tent for a week. At one point, he showed his librarian a small box of opium capsules, 18 in total, that he could use to \"journey to a dark place from which there was no return.\" Despite having rescued his army from catastrophe, he remained depressed and suicidal.Although Frederick demonstrated good leadership by rallying his troops against the surprise attack, Hochkirch is considered one of his worst losses, and it badly shook his equanimity.  Andrew Mitchell, the British envoy who was with them, and normally wrote positively about Frederick, attributed Frederick's loss to the contempt he had for Daun's supposedly cautious nature and his unwillingness to give credit to intelligence that did not agree with what he imagined was true: according to Mitchell, there was no one to blame but himself. That winter, Mitchell described the 46-year-old Frederick as \"an old man lacking half of his teeth, with greying hair, without gaiety or spark or imagination.\" Frederick suffered from gout and influenza, and refused to change his uniform, which was moth-eaten and covered in food and snuff stains.However, the situation could have been far worse for Frederick. The fabled discipline of his army held up: once the Prussians were out of the burning village, unit cohesion and discipline returned. Their discipline neutralized any strategic advantage the Austrians could have gained, and Daun's hesitation nullified the rest. Instead of following Frederick, or cutting off Retzow's division, which had not participated in the battle, Daun withdrew to the heights and positions he had occupied before the battle, so that his men might have a good rest under blankets after the fatigue of the day. After staying there for six days, they marched out in stealth to take up a new position between Belgern and Jesewitz, while Frederick remained at Dobersch\u00fctz.  Ultimately, the costly Austrian victory decided nothing.The Austrian failure to follow up with Frederick meant that the Prussians lived to fight another day.  Daun took great criticism for this, but not from the people who mattered the most, the Empress and her minister Kaunitz. For Frederick, instead of having the war decided at Hochkirch, he had the opportunity over the winter to rebuild his army. In two years of fighting (1756\u20131757) Frederick had lost over 100,000 soldiers to death, wounds, capture, disease and desertion. By Hochkirch, many regiments were only half-disciplined. In the winter after Hochkirch, he could only replace his soldiers with untrained men, many of whom would be foreigners and prisoners-of-war; he would be starting 1759 with a half-trained army of recruits, and seasoned soldiers who were exhausted by the slaughter. The only way he could hire men would be with British gold.Frederick's reputation for aggressiveness meant he could still terrify the Austrians simply by showing up. On 5 November, the anniversary of his great victory at Rossbach, Frederick marched toward Neisse, causing the Austrians to abandon their siege.  A few weeks later, as Frederick marched further west, Daun took the entire army into winter quarters in Bohemia. Consequently, despite major losses, at the end of the campaign year, Frederick remained in possession of Saxony and Silesia, and his name remained feared in at least that part of Europe.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model. Hadoop was originally designed for computer clusters built from commodity hardware, which is still the common use. It has since also found use on clusters of higher-end hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common occurrences and should be automatically handled by the framework.The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part, known as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and a processing part which is a MapReduce programming model. Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster. It then transfers packaged code into nodes to process the data in parallel. This approach takes advantage of data locality, where nodes manipulate the data they have access to. This allows the dataset to be processed faster and more efficiently than it would be in a more conventional supercomputer architecture that relies on a parallel file system where computation and data are distributed via high-speed networking.The base Apache Hadoop framework is composed of the following modules:\n\nHadoop Common \u2013 contains libraries and utilities needed by other Hadoop modules;\nHadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) \u2013 a distributed file-system that stores data on commodity machines, providing very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster;\nHadoop YARN \u2013 (introduced in 2012) is a platform responsible for managing computing resources in clusters and using them for scheduling users' applications;\nHadoop MapReduce \u2013 an implementation of the MapReduce programming model for large-scale data processing.\nHadoop Ozone \u2013 (introduced in 2020) An object store for HadoopThe term Hadoop is often used for both base modules and sub-modules and also the ecosystem, or collection of additional software packages that can be installed on top of or alongside Hadoop, such as Apache Pig, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Phoenix, Apache Spark, Apache ZooKeeper, Apache Impala, Apache Flume, Apache Sqoop, Apache Oozie, and Apache Storm.Apache Hadoop's MapReduce and HDFS components were inspired by Google papers on MapReduce and Google File System.The Hadoop framework itself is mostly written in the Java programming language, with some native code in C and command line utilities written as shell scripts.

At that time, computers were just beginning to become commonplace, and he thought that such a high-tech child would be able to do many things, so he chose a slightly introverted boy as the main character. \"Hongo Higashi (Azuma)\" in the initial draft drawn by Yasuhiko. The name Amuro Ray was invented by general director Yoshiyuki Tomino over the course of a month Later, in Tomino's \"Mobile Suit Gundam Setting Book / Original Draft\", it was written as \"Amuro Rei\". Yasuhiko drew the idea of \"let's make it a red curly hair and make it a carrot-like character\". Also, in Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's image, Amuro was \"foreigner\" with red hair and blue eyes, but due to compromises, he is said to be a \"Nisei\" with brown hair and dark eyes.\nTomino gave the Gundam main character the name Amuro believing such word did not exist. However, three months after the show aired, Tomino received a letter from Sunrise informing him there was an island named Amuro in Okinawa. Amuro was introduced as an ordinary man in contrast to his rival Char Aznable. As a result, he found Amuro hard to write as he was meant to oppose Char whom Tomino found more interesting. In one scene of an early episode, Amuro is slapped by Bright as a method of correction. Tomino considered this scene vital as he found this type of violence needed for a young person to mature most notably due to the way Amuro was misbehaving. Shin Sasaki from Sunrise considers the final scene from the Mobile Suit Gundam film trilogy where Amuro returns to White Base as one of the most memorable ones from the entire franchise. Meanwhile, Amuro has a close relationship with Fraw Bow ever since childhood and remain friendly in the White Base. Yasuhiko had problems with Tomino's commentary about how these two characters do not end in a relationship. Instead, there is no further appeal between their relationship in Zeta Gundam where Amuro instead becomes more attracted to Sayla Mass, possibly due to her being his type of woman according to the staff.  Amuro was announced by Tomino as a new type of being as reflected in how society needs this new type of human being. Tomino considered Amuro \"kind of simple for the potential that human beings can reach in the future.\" Yasuhiko stated that Amuro's misrelationship with the members of the crew of the White Base and his mother were outstanding by the time the series premiered in contrast to previous conventional heroes who would make up with each other.Originally, Tomino did not want to include Amuro in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and when trying to kill him, he failed to do it. As a result, he decided to put Amuro on a friendly relationship with Char. The relationship the two rivals have in Zeta Gundam due to proper understanding between the two soldiers. In regards to Char's Counterattack, Tomino created the movie to end Amuro and Char's rivalry. While the story was written to primarily centered around Char's hypocristic ideal, Amuro would oppose them. Nevertheless, Char provides Amuro with weaponry to support his Mobile Suit so that both would fight on equal terms. The intense exchanges between both of them are compared with Tomino's own feeling of being tired after working on several series. Tomino believes Amuro's popularity in the film can be due to how the audience could easily empathize with the protagonist's problems. The rivalry Amuro and Char develop in the film was that of a \"raw/carnal feeling\", leaving the viewers the impression of both having homoerotic impressions. Kawai personally wanted the film to properly depict Amuro's mecha RX-78-02 Gundam in the same fashion as the original television series from 1978.Original plans for Char's Counterattack would involve Amuro becoming married which bothered the producers. Still, to Tomino, it seemed like the most critical opinion in planning the movie production, and he adopted it as a critical point. Tomino expressed that since Gundam was still the mecha genre, he could not make Amuro become somebody's possession that leads to a normal life. Tomino believes je have not forgotten this principle regarding combat. As for the characters, the world of Gundam is a story of evolving humans, which inevitably leads to the \"denial of things\" and \"denial of machines.\" This is what is meant by the \"denial of Amuro's marriage.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "170_678", "question": "Who was Crucifixion, seen from the Cross created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "170_15190", "text": "Along with Robert Campin and later Rogier van der Weyden, Van Eyck revolutionised the approach towards naturalism and realism in Northern European painting during the early to mid 15th century. He was the first to manipulate oils to give the close detailing that infused his figures with the high degree of realism and complexity of emotion seen in this diptych. He coupled this with a mastery of glaze to create luminous surfaces with a deep perspective\u2014most noticeable in the upper portion of the Crucifixion panel\u2014which had not been achieved before.In the 1420s and 1430s, when oil and panel painting were still in their infancy, vertical formats were often used for depictions of the Last Judgement, because the narrow framing particularly suited a hierarchical presentation of heaven, earth and hell. By contrast, depictions of the Crucifixion were usually presented in a horizontal format. To fit such expansive and highly detailed representations onto two equally small and narrow wings, van Eyck was forced to make a number of innovations, redesigning many elements of the Crucifixion panel to match the vertical and condensed presentation of the Judgement narrative. The result is a panel with the crosses rising high into the sky, an unusually packed crowd scene in the mid-ground, and the moving spectacle of the mourners in the foreground, all rendered in a continuous slope from bottom to top in the style of medieval tapestries. Art historian Otto P\u00e4cht says it \"is the whole world in one painting, an Orbis Pictus\".In the Crucifixion panel, van Eyck follows the early 14th-century tradition of presenting the biblical episodes using a narrative technique. According to art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith, the episodes appear as \"simultaneous, not sequential\" events. Van Eyck condenses key episodes from the gospels into a single composition, each placed so as to draw the viewer's eye upward in a logical sequence. This device allowed van Eyck to create a greater illusion of depth with more complex and unusual spatial arrangements. In the Crucifixion panel, he uses different indicators to show the relative closeness of particular groupings of figures to Jesus. Given the size of the mourners in the foreground relative to the crucified figures, the soldiers and spectators gathered in the mid-ground are far larger than a strict adherence to perspective would allow. In the Last Judgement the damned are placed in hell in the lower mid-ground while the saints and angels are positioned higher in the upper foreground. P\u00e4cht writes of this panel that the scene is \"assimilated into a single spatial cosmos\", with the archangel acting as a divider in the pictorial space between heaven and hell.Art historians are unsure as to whether the panels were meant to be a diptych or a triptych. They may have formed the outer wings of a triptych, with a since-lost panel representing the Adoration of the Magi at the centre, or, as the German art historian J.D. Passavant speculated in 1841, the lost centre panel may have been a Nativity. It is now thought unlikely that a lost panel could be the postulated original companion to the outer wings; such a coupling would have been very odd to painters of the 1420s and 1430s. It has also been proposed that a central piece was added later, or as Albert Ch\u00e2telet writes, the central panel may have been stolen. Art historian Erwin Panofsky believed the Crucifixion and Last Judgement panels were intended as a diptych. He argued that it would have been unusual for mere outer wings to have been given the \"sumptuous treatment\" afforded these two panels. This approach is reminiscent of the medieval reliquaries. Others have observed that triptychs were usually much larger works intended for public display, and they tended towards gilded and heavily inscribed frames; typically only the central panel would have been as lavishly decorated as these panels. Contemporary diptychs, in contrast, were usually produced for private devotion and were typically ungilded. There is no documentary evidence for an original central panel, however, and technical examination suggests the two works were intended as wings of a diptych, then an emerging format. P\u00e4cht believes there is not enough evidence to determine whether a third panel existed.The diptych is notable for the first known naturalistic depiction of the Moon's features. It had previously been typical to show the Moon as a blank disk or crescent, or with a human face. Here, the waning gibbous Moon is shown as it would appear in the mid-morning western sky in Judea, including major features such as the Mare Imbrium and the Oceanus Procellarum.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The basket contains a selection of summer fruit:\n\n... a good-sized, light-red peach attached to a stem with wormholes in the leaf resembling damage by oriental fruit moth (Orthosia hibisci). Beneath it is a single bicolored apple, shown from a stem perspective with two insect entry holes, probably codling moth, one of which shows secondary rot at the edge; one blushed yellow pear with insect predations resembling damage by leaf roller (Archips argyospita); four figs, two white and two purple\u2014the purple ones dead ripe and splitting along the sides, plus a large fig leaf with a prominent fungal scorch lesion resembling anthracnose (Glomerella cingulata); and a single unblemished quince with a leafy spur showing fungal spots. There are four clusters of grapes, black, red, golden, and white; the red cluster on the right shows several mummied fruit, while the two clusters on the left each show an overripe berry. There are two grape leaves, one severely desiccated and shriveled while the other contains spots and evidence of an egg mass. In the right part of the basket are two green figs and a ripe black one is nestled in the rear on the left. On the sides of the basket are two disembodied shoots: to the right is a grape shoot with two leaves, both showing severe insect predations resembling grasshopper feeding; to the left is a floating spur of quince or pear.\nMuch has been made of the worm-eaten, insect-predated, and generally less than perfect condition of the fruit. In line with the culture of the age, the general theme appears to revolve about the fading beauty, and the natural decaying of all things. Scholars also describe the basket of fruit as a metaphor of the Church.\n\nA recent X-ray study revealed that it was painted on an already used canvas painted with grotesques in the style of Caravaggio's friend Prospero Orsi, who helped the artist in his first breakthrough into the circles of collectors such as his first patron, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, around 1594/1595, and who remained close to him for many years thereafter.Scholars have had more than their usual level of disagreement in assigning a date to the painting: John T. Spike places it in 1596; Catherine Puglisi believes that 1601 is more probable; and practically every year in between has been advanced. Puglisi's reasoning seem solid, (the basket in this painting seems identical with the one in the first of Caravaggio's two versions of Supper at Emmaus - even the quince seems to be the same piece of fruit), but no consensus has emerged.In 1607 it was part of Cardinal Federico Borromeo\u2019s collection, a provenance which raises the plausibility of a conscious reference to the Book of Amos. Borromeo, who was archbishop of Milan, was in Rome approximately 1597-1602 and a house guest of Del Monte in 1599. He had a special interest in the Northern European painters such as Paul Bril and Jan Brueghel the Elder, who were also in Rome at the time, (indeed, he took Breughel into his own household), and in the way they did landscapes and flowers in paintings as subjects in their own right, something not known at the time in Italian art. He would have seen the way Caravaggio did still life as incidental accessories in paintings such as Boy Bitten by a Lizard, Bacchus, in Del Monte's collection, and The Lute Player in the collection of Del Monte's friend Vincenzo Giustiniani. The scholarly Giustiniani wrote a treatise on painting years later, wherein, reflecting the hierarchical conventions of his day, he placed flowers \"and other tiny things\" only fifth on a twelve-scale register, but he said also that Caravaggio once said to him \"that it used to take as much workmanship for him to do a good picture of flowers as it did to do one of human figures.\"\nLike its doppelganger in Supper at Emmaus, the basket seems to teeter on the edge of the picture-space, in danger of falling out of the painting and into the viewer's space instead. In the Supper this is a dramatic device, part of the way in which Caravaggio creates the tension of the scene; here, trompe-l'\u0153il seems to be almost the whole purpose of the painting, if we subtract the possible didactic element. But the single element that no doubt attracted its original owner, and still catches attention today, is the extraordinary quasi-photographic realism of the observation which underlies the illusionism. Basket of Fruit can be compared with the same artist's Still Life with Fruit (c. 1603), a painting which John Spike identifies as \"the source of all subsequent Roman still-life paintings.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It currently resides at the Art Institute of Chicago. It is a landscape painting featuring two women atop a cliff above the sea.\nThe canvas was inspired by an extended stay at Pourville in 1882. Monet settled in the village between February and mid-April, during which time he wrote to his future wife, Alice Hosched\u00e9, \"How beautiful the countryside is becoming, and what joy it would be for me to show you all its delightful nooks and crannies!\" They returned in June of that year. The two young women standing atop the cliff may be Hosched\u00e9's daughters, Marthe and Blanche; it has also been suggested that the figures represent Alice and Blanche, both of whom painted out of doors at that time.The various elements of the painting are unified through brushwork; short, crisp strokes were used to paint the grasses of the cliff, the women's drapery and the distant sea. A sense of movement suggested by painterly calligraphy was a property of Monet's work in the 1880s, and is here used to connote the effect of a summer wind upon figures, land, water, and clouds moving across the sky. During the painting process, Monet reduced the size of a rocky promontory at far right, to better balance the composition's proportions; however, it's also been noted that this secondary cliff was a late addition to the canvas, and was not part of the original design. An X-ray of the painting indicates that the artist originally painted a third figure into the grouping, then removed it.Describing similar works by the artist, art historian John House wrote, \u201cHis cliff tops rarely show a single sweep of terrain. Instead there are breaks in space; the eye progresses into depth by a succession of jumps; distance is expressed by planes overlapping each other and by atmospheric rather than linear perspective- by softening the focus and changes of color.\u201d The sense of immediacy is heightened by the juxtapositions of the cliff and sea, the contrast between ground and openness.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was commissioned by Catherine Lescuyer as a commemorative piece for her father. Rubens created it as part of an altarpiece in the Church of St. Rombout (Rumbold) in Mechelen. The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas dressed in blue turning back towards the viewer and away from the table. Other than Jesus, the most prominent figure is Judas. Judas holds his right hand to his mouth with his eyes avoiding direct contact with the other figures in the painting creating a nervous expression. Jesus is dressed in red and has a yellow halo surrounding his head with his face tilted upwards. Jesus is located centrally in the painting surrounded by his disciples with six on each side, and he holds a loaf of bread with a cup of wine in front of him. Out of all of the figures, he is the most in the light with the figures to the farthest left being the most in shadow. \u201cThe scene thus represents a perfect conflation of the theological significance of the Last Supper\u201d meaning the conflation between the blessing of the bread and the wine while still being pivotal in the sense of revealing the betrayal.As in many other Northern European depictions, a dog with a bone can be seen in the scene, probably a simple pet. It may represent  faith, dogs are traditionally symbols of and are representing faith. According to J. Richard Judson the dog near Judas perhaps represents greed or evil, as the companion of Judas, as in John 13:27.This painting followed the first unsuccessful attempt by Rubens to produce a Last Supper in 1611, when his patrons backed out the last minute, perhaps due to the high price of 4,000 Guilder asked by Rubens.Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper fresco was a significant influence on Rubens who created an etching after the Davinci Last Supper, which was one of Rubens' first attempts to express the full range of human emotion printed by Pieter Soutman. Rubens was also influenced by his humanist ideals from which he extracts biblical themes.Rubens often made engravings following the completion of his works.

Each round of the game started with news footage that introduced the news story in question to the studio audience and home viewers out of earshot of the panellists. After the guest was identified and/or the news story determined, the journalists then interviewed the guest about the story or about achievements or experiences for which he or she was known. Unlike American quiz shows that steered clear of controversy in the 1950s and 1960s, Front Page Challenge seems to have been affected by just one censorship practice, that of avoiding four-letter words.Guests came from all walks of life, including politicians like Pierre Trudeau and Indira Gandhi, activists like Malcolm X, sports figures like Gordie Howe, entertainers like Boris Karloff and Ed Sullivan, and writers like Upton Sinclair.  From 1957 to 1979, the show featured many non-Canadians whose trips to Canada were paid by the CBC. (Gandhi was even flown from India to Toronto in the 1960s at the CBC's expense.) Occasionally, guests were featured for their involvement in stories that had nothing to do with their celebrity status. For example, in 1958 Karloff was featured because he had served as a rescue worker in the aftermath of a devastating 1912 tornado in Regina, Saskatchewan, where he had been appearing in a play many years before horror films made him famous.Jayne Mansfield appeared on the Tuesday night telecast of 12 December 1961 representing the victories two years earlier of British prime minister Harold Macmillan and his Conservative Party in the 1959 United Kingdom general election. The American actress, whose high IQ was well-publicized, was filming a movie in the United Kingdom in 1959 when she and others connected with the movie read and heard about the election results.  The CBC archive has two photographs of Mansfield during her 1961 visit to the Toronto television studio where Front Page Challenge always originated during that era, but the videotape of her episode was lost due to wiping.\nOccasionally, the challenger on Front Page Challenge was one of the panellists themselves, unbeknownst to the other three panellists. After the game, the relevant person simply moved to the guest seat for the interview.\nThe show ran for nearly 40 years and featured a remarkably stable cast of panellists, including journalist-historian Pierre Berton, Betty Kennedy (who later become a Canadian senator), Toby Robins (who later became a movie actress) and radio commentator Gordon Sinclair. Columnist Allan Fotheringham joined the panel after Sinclair's death. A guest panellist, usually another Canadian journalist, politician or other celebrity, was also part of each episode. In 1990, journalist and radio/TV personality Jack Webster joined the show as its permanent fourth panellist.For its initial summer 1957 run, the show was hosted by Win Barron, best known for his voice-over narration of newsreels produced by the Canadian division of Paramount Pictures. However, Barron proved ill at ease in the moderator's seat, so both Fred Davis and panellist Alex Barris rotated as guest hosts in the early part of the fall before Davis was chosen to take over as host full-time (a position he retained for the rest of the show's run), though Barris continued to appear as a guest panellist occasionally and was the show's writer for the duration of its run. In 1981, the CBC published an oversized book written by Barris about the history of the program. It was titled Front Page Challenge: The 25th Anniversary. Four years after the show's cancellation, another book by Barris was published chronicling the last fifteen years of the show.  It included more details and anecdotes about the show's earlier phases not found in his first book.Several weeks after its debut, Ottawa Citizen television columnist Bob Blackburn deemed the programme to be noticeably improved and predicted that if that trend continued \"and if the program doesn't run dry on its slightly limited subject matter, Front Page Challenge might well become an institution on Canadian TV\".In his book, Barris says that at the height of the show's popularity in the late 1950s, the individual panellists became major celebrities in Canada. He relates how Toby Robins, a beautiful brunette, donned a blonde wig for a few episodes as an experiment, attracting hate mail including a death threat over the change of appearance. The books also include journalist Barbara Frum's remarks about how influential Robins was for 1950s-era female equality through her decision to appear on the program while pregnant.\nUnfortunately, the show's stability proved to be its undoing, as the producers did not see fit to add younger panellists while the regulars aged and the audience demographics became less desirable. The show always was videotaped in or aired live from Toronto prior to 1966. During that year four shows originated from Montreal including one with challenger Jessica Mitford. The show continued going on the road, being videotaped in cities across Canada. The oldest regular, Gordon Sinclair, continued travelling with his fellow panellists to videotaping locations until he was well into his 80s. Although the location of the studio was not always noticeable to home viewers, they did notice the lack of guest challengers from foreign countries after 1979. The program no longer featured internationally known controversial figures to match the likes of Timothy Leary, Indira Gandhi, Menachem Begin (when he was a Knesset member) and William F. Buckley who had held viewers' attention in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Alex Barris says in his second book that the absence of non-Canadian guests after 1979 resulted from budget cuts for CBC Television that ruled out travel expenses.Barris also claims that the advent of multiple cable channels in the 1980s and early 1990s (in cities, towns and rural areas near the border of the United States where people could receive programming from both countries) presented another challenge to the staff of Front Page Challenge and contributed to its demise. Prior to the 1980s when there were no 24-hour news channels competing with Front Page Challenge, each round of the game began with silent black-and-white newsreel footage of the news story in question while a narrator, not heard by the panellists, summarized it. Even after the segments started including colour videotape, the only voice heard introducing the topical issue and the challenger was the voice of the narrator of Front Page Challenge.\nProducers continued to use the same off-screen narrator,\nwhich made the Front Page Challenge footage less appealing to young people than the multiple sound bites featured by CBC Newsworld, which began 24-hour newscasts throughout Canada on 31 July 1989. CBC Newsworld offered sound bite interviews with people who had witnessed events or were knowledgeable about them. Young viewers using remote controls stuck with the multiple sound bites and ignored the Front Page Challenge narrator's summaries of the news stories, according to the book by Alex Barris published in 1999. As the pace of 1980s news quickened, even before the launch of CBC Newsworld, Fred Davis, Betty Kennedy and Pierre Berton obviously remained mentally sharp enough to follow all of it, but they had not witnessed 99 percent of the events about which they were so curious.  Young viewers in the 1980s were accustomed to listening to people who had witnessed current events or had made them happen.\nWhen Front Page Challenge ceased production in 1995, it was the longest continually running non-news program in Canadian television history. Among the contestants on the final show was then-emerging country music superstar Shania Twain.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He used a bold colour scheme with a contrasting palette and he exploited the fall of the natural light through the window of the garret to implement his much loved style at the time, chiaroscuro. Wallis painted the work in a friend's chamber in Gray's Inn, with St Paul's Cathedral visible on the skyline through the window. It was probably a coincidence that this location was close to the garret in Brooke Street where Chatterton had died 86 years before. The model used for the painting was the young George Meredith, a 19th-century English novelist and poet.The painting was Wallis's first exhibited work. It was shown at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1856, with a quotation from the Tragedy of Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe inscribed on the frame: \"Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight, And burned is Apollo's laurel bough\". It was an immediate success, with John Ruskin describing it as \"faultless and wonderful\". It drew large crowds at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857, was also exhibited in Dublin in 1859, and was one of the most popular paintings of the 19th century in reproductive print form.\nWallis sold the painting to Augustus Egg in 1856, and Egg sold the right to make engraved reproductions. The painting became the subject of a court case after Dublin photographer James Robinson was inspired to recreate the painting as a tableau vivant so he could sell photographs of the scene. The painting was left to the Tate Gallery by Charles Gent Clement in 1899.\nThere are two smaller versions of the same subject by Wallis, one either a study or a replica in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, which measures 17.3 centimetres (6.8 in) by 25.25 centimetres (9.94 in) and, somewhat unusually for the period, a small oil-on-panel replica at the Yale Center for British Art, which measures 22.7 centimetres (8.9 in) by 30.2 centimetres (11.9 in). The Birmingham work was sold at Christie's in 1875 to Baron Albert Grant and then in 1877 to William Kendrick, who donated it to the gallery in 1918.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The plot is as ingenious as ever, the writing more careful, the dialogue both wise and witty; while suspense is engendered from the very start, and maintained skilfully until the final revelation: it will be a clever reader indeed who anticipates this, and though Miss Christie is as usual scrupulously fair in scattering her clues, close attention to the text is necessary if a correct solution of the mystery is to be arrived at before the astute Miss Marple unmasks the culprit.\" The review concluded, \"Miss Christie has several surprises up her sleeve besides the main one, and (this much may be said without spoiling the reader's pleasure) she once again breaks new ground by creating a weak and kindly murderer who is yet responsible for the deaths of three people: that such a character should, in the last analysis, seem credible, is a tribute to the author's psychological acumen and originality of concept.\"Maurice Richardson, in the 4 June 1950 issue of The Observer, said, \"For her fiftieth book she has chosen a snug, residential village setting with her favourite detective, silver-haired, needle-sharp spinster, Miss Marple, making a delayed appearance.

They moved from Machida 5 years earlier, after the massacre of their parents in their apartment complex, which was attacked and overrun by unknown assailants who ruthlessly and brutally killed almost everyone in several buildings in the complex. He has been having recurring dreams for some time, of a tattooed girl covered in blood holding a giant sword surrounded by bodies, but they are now growing more frequent. It is the day his class graduates to become investigators for The Special Mobile Investigation Forces, or Tokki, which he joined to learn about his parents' death. Later on the day of his graduation, he sees the girl from his dream wearing a police uniform. She is Sakura Rokujo, who is in the same class as him and a member of Section 2, known officially as Special Public Safety Task Force, or Tokko. Its other main members include the young prodigy Kureha Suzuka, the silent strongman Takeru Inukai and its leader Ryoko Ibuki. There are many rumors about Tokko, one of which is that they use swords to execute criminals and that body parts are often found at the crime scenes Tokko investigates. There are also rumors that they aren't even human.\nWhen Ranmaru's unit investigates another grizzly murder, a witness claims to see a demon, which was also rumored at other bloody scenes. There they encounter humans with talking human faced larva parasites growing out of them, that are impervious to guns. The demons refer to Ranmaru as having the scent of Michida and attack, before he is saved by Sakura and Tokko. She explains that they were just lesser monsters controlled to target survivors of the Michida incident. Afterwards, Ranmaru's team researches previous violent dismemberments and learns that most have witnesses claiming to see demons and that the incidents have been on the rise since Michida. Sakura soon after reveals to Ranmaru that the Machida incident was caused by the monsters, which are demons from the otherworld. Five days before the incident, a box created by ancient philosophers and alchemists was opened that connects to the otherworld, the demons that came through committed the massacre. The stronger demons are called Phantoms and grow stronger by eating humans, these are the ones Tokko are tasked with finding and killing. The holes created by the earthquakes are the gates that allow them to enter the world. It is also confirmed that the main members of Tokko aren't fully human, referring to themselves as hunters.\nRanmaru and his best friend and partner Hanazono sneak into the closed off Machida crime scene to inspect the hole. When Ranmaru disturbs the hole by dropping something in it, a demon comes out an attacks them. Tokko arrives and saves them, and explains they are all survivors of Machida and the only ones that can defeat them as they have \"awakened\" into symbionts, having Phantoms inside them that protected them during the incident. The Machida hole is getting bigger and in two years will swallow Tokyo. The box that opened the gate was broken into 108 pieces, each of which is inside a Phantom, and Tokko collects the pieces in order to close the gate. The 12th Phantom, the one controlling the human faced larva parasites, then appears. Ranmaru asks Kureha Suzuka to show him how to awaken so he can fight, even after she warns him that he might not remain himself in which case they would have to kill him. To do so she mortally wounds him and throws him into the hole. When he emerges he completes the symbiosis with a giant demon, forming his tattoos and granting him two large swords, and defeats the Phantom in one attack. When he wakes up a week later, he is transferred to Tokko. In the epilogue it is hinted that two years later the hole did in fact swallow Tokyo.\nThe story then focuses on Itsuto Araragi and his sister Mayu in 2011, who are survivors of Michida and symbiont hunters unaffiliated with Tokko. Together they hunt Phantoms and eat them to get stronger, absorbing their abilities, aiming to eventually kill them all. They accidentally save Yukino Shiraishi from committing suicide and deduce she was being controlled by a Phantom. They learn students have been going missing at her university and that there are rumors of \"demons\". There they encounter many Phantoms, learning that some humans willing become them. It is revealed this all started when Yukino discovered what she thought to be a mummy hand and took it back the university, it was in fact a Phantom hand from Machida. Her father, who works at the university, began experimenting and learned humans can become a hybrid of human and phantom by eating them and began to turn the students as well. He was the one who planted a larva in Yukino to make her commit suicide, after she saw him kill her mother. Using their newly absorbed abilities from the Phantoms at the school, Itsuto and Mayu defeat her father, with her finishes him off herself by setting their house on fire.

In Final Fantasy VII, Cloud is a mercenary who wields a large broadsword and claims to have formerly been part of SOLDIER, a group of elite supersoldiers employed by the Shinra Electric Power Company, a megacorporation responsible for draining life from the planet. He later defected from SOLDIER after becoming disillusioned with Shinra, and in an attempt to get paid, he joins the resistance group AVALANCHE in the fight against Shinra and his former superior, the primary antagonist Sephiroth, who aims to annihilate the world. Over the course of the story, it is eventually revealed that Cloud is a mentally-scarred individual who adopted the skill and personality of an actual SOLDIER, the deceased Zack Fair, and is actually little more than a Shinra foot soldier, but learns to accept his troubled past and his own identity in order to defeat Sephiroth and save the world.\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 computer-animated sequel film, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, in which he fights a new threat composed of a trio attacking his allies while also dealing with a terminal illness called \"Geostigma\". He acts in a supporting role in other Compilation of Final Fantasy VII titles, and is featured in several other games in the wider Final Fantasy series. He has also made guest appearances in various titles outside the franchise, such as the Kingdom Hearts series by Square Enix and Disney and the Super Smash Bros. series by Nintendo.\nCloud was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, a character artist for the Final Fantasy series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. Yoshinori Kitase, director of VII, and Kazushige Nojima, one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After VII, Nomura redesigned Cloud for Advent Children, giving him a more realistic appearance alongside new weaponry and a new outfit. For Remake, the team aimed to adapt his classic design for a more realistic artstyle.\nCloud has garnered primarily positive reception from critics, and has been described as one of the most iconic video game protagonists. He has also been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first unreliable narrators and for the game's depiction of his mental disorder. Additionally, he is seen as a messiah figure in both the game and film for opposing Sephiroth's schemes and supported by his allies. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by Famitsu, Guinness, and other organizations. His characterization and design have also influenced other characters, most notably Lightning from Final Fantasy XIII. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as action figures and jewelry. Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors, with Steve Burton and Cody Christian's English vocal performances being the subject of praise.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Woland is the mysterious foreigner and professor whose visit to Moscow sets the plot rolling and turns the world upside-down.\nHis demonic retinue, which includes witches, vampires, and a gigantic talking cat, his role in the plot, and the fact that Voland is a (now outdated) German word for a devil or evil spirit, all imply that he is, in fact, the Devil. More controversial interpretations see him as the Apostle Peter (based on Jesus\u2019 remark to Peter, \"Get thee behind me, Satan\") or even the Second Coming of Christ.Edward Ericson argues that Woland is essentially \"the Satan of orthodox (specifically Russian Orthodox) Christian theology [...] He is both a tempter of men and an unwitting instrument of divine justice, a being who owes his existence and power to the very one he opposes.\"In conceiving of Woland, Bulgakov draws heavily from the figure of Mephistopheles in Goethe's Faust, a connection made explicit by the use of an epigraph from the poem at the beginning of the novel. Additionally, the name Woland itself is derived from a name by which Mephistopheles refers to himself during the Walpurgisnacht scene: squire Voland (German: Junker Voland).

However, the cloud of dust leaving the camp which the townsmen indicated as a retreat was in fact created by camp followers departing before the battle.The English advanced but soon ran into the full force of the French army. Despite being outnumbered and in a vulnerable position, Talbot ordered his men to continue fighting. Historian A.J. Pollard suggests this seemingly reckless behaviour from Talbot may be due to the fact that his \"pride and honour were at stake for he had already ordered his men to battle when he discovered the strength of the French position\". The only Englishman who remained mounted in the battle, he also did not wear armour due to previous agreements with the French when he was released from captivity in Normandy.According to David Nicolle, the battle itself was \"highly characteristic of the period\" with the strong field fortification of the French and the small-arms fighting of the battle. In many ways, this battle played out like the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy in \"reverse\". The French guns obliterated the advancing soldiers, with each shot reportedly killing six men at a time. Talbot's reinforcements continued to arrive at the battle, only to suffer the same fate in their turn. Despite the odds against the English, the battle lasted over an hour until a thousand-strong Breton cavalry force led by Peter II, Duke of Brittany, crashed into their right flank, sending them into retreat.The battle ended in an English rout, and both Talbot and his son were killed. There is some debate over the circumstances of Talbot's death, but it appears that his horse was killed by a cannon shot, and its mass pinning him down, a French archer in turn killed him with an axe.The survivors of the clash as well as the remnant of the Anglo-Gascon force which had not been thrown into the battle, totalling up to 5,000 men, including John de Foix, 1st Earl of Kendal, sought refuge in the castle of Castillon.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They made a number of games for the Commodore 64, among them Project Firestart, which was one of the most atmospheric titles for the C64.\nIn the following years, Dynamix created a line of action games for Penguin Software and Electronic Arts, including one of the first games for the Amiga, Arcticfox. Later titles were developed for Activision. After self-publishing their games for a short while, in 1990 Dynamix was bought by Sierra On-Line.\nDynamix had published A-10 Tank Killer and distributed it through Mediagenic, but the acquisition occurred during the development of Red Baron, which became the first game in Dynamix's \"Great Warplanes\" flight simulator series published by Sierra. Dynamix created some of their most famous games, including a line of adventures and simulators that included Red Baron and The Adventures of Willy Beamish. They also created the puzzle game The Incredible Machine, along with the spinoff Sid & Al's Incredible Toons.  Another successful product line was the Front Page Sports series, designed by Pat Cook and Allen McPheeters which included Football, Baseball, and Golf. Versions of Red Baron and Front Page Sports Football were included as part of the ImagiNation Network.\nAs a developer, Dynamix was notable for their early use of digitized graphics, animations and sounds effects in PC, Atari ST and Amiga games. The techniques were first used in 1988 in Pete Rose Pennant Fever, and used most notably in movie tie-in games like Die Hard and Ghostbusters II, as well as David Wolf: Secret Agent and Death Track.\nBy 1994 Slye agreed with a Computer Gaming World statement that \"Now when someone hears 'Dynamix' they immediately think 'flight simulator'\". In 1994, the first game in a new series called Metaltech was released, a giant robot combat game with similarities to the BattleTech universe and games. This series resulted in two Earthsiege games and eventually Starsiege. As a side development of the Starsiege game, the successful Tribes series was created. Dynamix also created Outpost 2: Divided Destiny, the second game in Sierra's strategy/survival franchise, Outpost.\nThe Dynamix studio was closed by Sierra On-Line on August 14, 2001, as part of Sierra's restructuring under Vivendi Universal Interactive Publishing.

He was ten years older than Luisa Carlotta.\nLuisa Carlotta played an important role during the sickness of Ferdinand VII to ensure that her niece, Isabella, became heiress to the Spanish throne instead of her uncle Carlos. She supported the new succession law issued by the king.\nWhen the king Ferdinand VII was suffering from a very severe gout attack that many feared would end his life (1832), a huge variety of characters, including the ambassador of Naples and her own confessor, harassed the Queen of Spain to persuade her to renounce the dynastic rights of her daughters in favor of Carlos, to avoid the horrors of a civil war. The queen crumbled under the pressures and got her husband to repeal the Pragmatic Sanction of 1830. This meant that the king's daughters would lose their right to the throne, in favor of the king's brother.\nWhen the Counsel of Castile, an organization that favored a transition towards constitutionalism, learned about this, they sent word to Luisa Carlotta who was famous for her determination and strong personality, in hopes that she could persuade the queen to change her mind again. Luisa Carlotta rode nonstop after receiving the news and arrived to La Granja, unannounced, four days after the Pragmatic Sanction had been repealed. She went to find her sister who she criticized for her lack of resolve, calling her \"regina di galler\u00eda\". Afterwards she confronted prime minister Tadeo Calomarde. It is said that she was involved in an incident during the sickness of the Spanish monarch regarding this issue: when the Spanish king lay sick expecting death (1832), Luisa Carlotta tried by force to acquire a document forbidding female succession from prime minister Tadeo Calomarde and throw it on the fire. When Calomarde tried to save the document, she struck him in the face, upon which he uttered the well known words: \"Madame, white hands don't offend!\". Some authors, like Comellas, consider the slap an urban legend. Regardless, Luisa Carlotta was a formidable opponent to Calomarde in court.\nWhen the king recovered, on 31 December 1832 he named his daughter heiress again, and gave the queen full regency powers. During the last months of Ferdinand's life, while Maria Christina was regent, Carlotta stayed in the Spanish court and supported her sister in her governmental role. Carlotta was more active in government than her sister, to the point that first secretary Francisco Cea Berm\u00fadez met with her more often than with the queen.\nWhen her niece became queen in 1833 with her sister as regent, the friendship between the sisters turned into rivalry, and she left Spain for Paris.

The centerpiece of the ceiling, painted by Giovanni Battista Crosato, depicts Apollo riding his carriage between Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. The coat of arms of the Rezzonico family, with a double-headed eagle, also is prominently displayed on the wall of the ballroom facing the entry door. The two enormous chandeliers made of wood and gilded metal, from the mid-18th century, are among the few fixtures that date to the original period of the building.

{"id": "170_734", "question": "Who was Hardware created by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "176_59029", "text": "The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer was originally conceived by The 3DO Company, founded in September 12, 1991 by Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins. The company's objective was to create a next-generation, CD-based video game/entertainment standard which would be manufactured by various partners and licensees; 3DO would collect a royalty on each console sold and on each game manufactured. To game publishers, the low US$3 royalty rate per game was a better deal than the higher royalties paid to Nintendo and Sega when making games for their consoles. The 3DO hardware itself was designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical (designers of the Amiga and Atari Lynx), starting from an outline on a restaurant napkin in 1989. Trip Hawkins was a long-time acquaintance of Needle and Mical and found that their design very closely fit his philosophy for architecture and approach, so he decided that: \"Rather than me start a brand new team and starting from scratch it just made a lot of sense to ... join forces with them and shape what they were doing into what I wanted it to be.\"The 3DO Company lacked the resources to manufacture consoles, and instead licensed the hardware to other companies for manufacturing. Trip Hawkins recounted that they approached every electronics manufacturer, but that their chief targets were Sony and Panasonic, the two largest consumer electronics companies in the world. However, Sony had already begun development on their own console, the PlayStation, and ultimately decided to continue work on it rather than sign with 3DO. According to former Sega CEO Tom Kalinske The 3DO Company was engaged in very serious talks for Sega to become involved with the 3DO. However, it was passed on by Sega due to concerns over cost. Panasonic launched the 3DO with its FZ-1 model in 1993, though Goldstar and Sanyo would later manufacture the 3DO as well. Companies who obtained the hardware license but never actually sold 3DO units include Samsung, Toshiba, and AT&T, who went so far as to build prototype AT&T 3DO units and display them at the January 1994 Consumer Electronics Show.Licensing to independent manufacturers made the system extremely expensive. The manufacturers had to make a profit on the hardware itself, whereas most major game console manufacturers, such as Sega and Sony, sold their systems at a loss, with expectations of making up for the loss with software sales. The 3DO was priced at US$699, far above competing game systems and aimed at high-end users and early adopters. Hawkins has argued that 3DO was launched at $599, and not \"higher myths that are often reported\". In a later interview, Hawkins clarified that while the suggested retail price was $699, not all retailers sold the system at that price. Goldstar, Sanyo, and Panasonic's later models were less expensive to manufacture than the FZ-1 and were sold for considerably lower prices. For example, the Goldstar model launched at $399. In addition, after six months on the market, the price of the FZ-1 had dropped to $499, leading some to contend that the 3DO's cost was not as big a factor in its market failure as is usually claimed.Hawkins' belief was that the 3DO system could become a dominant standard in a similar way to that achieved by the VHS video cassette format, with several companies being able to promote the standard effectively against individual competitors with their own technologies, such as Sony and Betamax, in the context of VHS. It was also believed that companies would be able to more effectively compete by being able to leverage a common standard, as opposed to having to attract developers to individual formats, with Hawkins noting that this would be \"tough for Atari and Sony\". Indeed, Hawkins believed that the failure of NEC to establish its TurboGrafx system, and yet being \"much bigger than Sony\", illustrated the difficulties faced by new entrants to the console market and thought that Sony, in following the business model of Sega and Nintendo, \"would have had a better chance if it had partnered with some of the others\". Meanwhile, other products were not regarded as competitive threats: the Atari Jaguar was perceived as \"primitive\" and \"slightly better than a 16-bit system\", and the Philips CD-i was regarded as \"really obsolete by today's standards\". Both 3DO and Philips, seeking to pioneer the broader concept of interactive entertainment, aimed to sell in the order of one million units during 1994 and into 1995.Hawkins claimed that the console was HDTV-capable, and that the company could use its technology for a set-top box. It was believed the platform would appeal to cable companies seeking to provide digital interactive services, with broadcasts being accompanied by digital information, eventually leading to the development of video-on-demand services on what was described as a \"client-server interactive network\", with an interactive networking trial having been announced in collaboration with US West in Omaha, Nebraska for the autumn of 1994. Computer Gaming World reported in January 1994 that 3DO \"is poised for an avalanche of software support to appear in the next 12 months\", unlike the Atari Jaguar and Pioneer LaserActive. The magazine predicted that \"If 3DO's licensees can get enough machines and software out in the market, this could very well become the interactive gamer's entry level machine\" and possibly \"the ideal plug and play solution for those of us who are tired of playing circuit board roulette with our personal computers\". Electronic Arts promoted the console in two-page advertisements, describing it as a \"technological leap\" and promising \"twenty new titles ... over the next twelve months\".The launch of the platform in October 1993 received a great deal of attention in the press as part of the \"multimedia wave\" in the computer world at the time. Return Fire, Road Rash, FIFA International Soccer, and Jurassic Park Interactive had been slated for launch releases but were pushed to mid-1994 due to the developers' struggles with the then-cutting-edge hardware. Moreover, the 3DO Company made continued updates to the console hardware almost up to the system's release, which resulted in a number of third-party titles missing the launch date, in some cases by less than a month, because the developers weren't left enough time to fully test them on the finalized hardware. The only 3DO software available at launch was the third-party game Crash 'n Burn. Panasonic also failed to manufacture an ample supply of the console in time for launch day, and as a result most retail stores only received one or two units. By mid-November, the 3DO had sold 30,000 units.The system was released in Japan in March 1994 with an initial lineup of six games. The Japanese launch was moderately successful, with 70,000 units shipping to 10,000 stores. However, sales soon dropped and by 1995 the system was known in Japan as a host for pornographic releases.The 3DO's claim to the title of most advanced console on the market was lost with the 1994 Japanese launches of the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The 3DO Company responded by emphasizing their console's large existing software library, lower price (both the Panasonic and Goldstar models were $299 by this time), and promised successor: the M2. To assure consumers that the 3DO would still be supported, the M2 was initially announced as an add-on for the 3DO. It was later revealed that the M2 would be an entirely separate console, albeit one with 3DO backward compatibility. Eventually the M2 project was cancelled.\nUnlike Panasonic, Goldstar initially produced only 3DO hardware, not software. This made it difficult to manage competitive price drops, and when the price of the Goldstar 3DO dropped to $199 in December 1995, the company took a loss of more than $100 on each sale. Goldstar tried switching to the usual industry model of selling hardware at a loss and profiting on software, but though a handful of Goldstar games were published for the 3DO, Goldstar's software development operation arrived too late to allow them to turn a profit on the 3DO. This lack of a profitable business model, combined with Panasonic acquiring exclusive rights to the M2 technology, were cited as the two chief reasons for Goldstar dropping support for the 3DO in early 1996. During the second quarter of 1996 several of the 3DO's most loyal software supporters, including the software division of The 3DO Company themselves, announced they were no longer making games for the system, leaving Panasonic as the only company supporting active software development for the 3DO.The 3DO system was eventually discontinued towards the end of 1996, with a complete shutdown of all internal hardware development and divestment of the M2 technology. The 3DO Company restructured themselves around this same time, selling off their hardware division to become a multi-platform company focused on software development and online gaming. After selling the Opera hardware to Samsung in 1997, the hardware was revived in South Korea for another 2 years then discontinued again at some point in late 1998 or early 1999. The amount of systems produced after the Samsung buyout is unknown.\nThe initial high price is considered to be one of the many issues that led to the 3DO's failure, along with lack of significant funding that larger companies such as Sony took advantage of. In an interview shortly after The 3DO Company dropped support for the system, Trip Hawkins attributed its failure to the model of licensing all hardware manufacturing and software to third parties. He reasoned that for a console to be a success, it needed a single strong company to take the lead in marketing, hardware, and software, and pointed out that it was essentially a lack of coordination between The 3DO Company, Panasonic, and the 3DO's software developers which had led to the console launching with only one game ready.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the aftermath of the breakup, she meets and has a one-night stand with plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who becomes her friend. Torres and O'Malley subsequently reconcile, and the two marry in Las Vegas on the spur of the moment. Confused, O'Malley confides to fellow intern Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), about his relationship woes over alcohol, leading to a drunken sexual encounter between the two. Torres remains unaware of his sexual encounter, but becomes increasingly suspicious, and announces her desire to conceive a child. Shortly thereafter, however, she discovers that O'Malley has been unfaithful, ending their marriage. Though her personal life is troubled, Torres thrives professionally when she is appointed as the hospital's Chief Resident. However, she soon begins struggling to cope in the role, and is demoted soon thereafter.\nTorres forms a friendship with Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), the hospital's new chief of cardiothoracic surgery. The two embark on a relationship when Hahn jokingly kisses Torres in an elevator to tease Sloan. Neither has been with another woman before, and Torres struggles with her bisexuality, and cheats on her with Sloan. She is initially forgiven, but after an argument about work, Hahn resigns from Seattle Grace, ending their relationship. New pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) kisses her, and they begin dating. Their relationship is tested when Torres comes out to her father, Carlos, who disowns her, cutting her off both financially and emotionally. When she is not granted a position as an attending, she publicly berates the chief, Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), and resigns from her post. She begins working at the neighboring Mercy West hospital, and when the two hospitals merge, she is promoted to an attending surgeon. Torres' father returns yet again, to condemn her, but ultimately accepts her sexuality. When Torres explains her desire to bear children, Robbins expresses disappointment, and their differing stances on the matter lead them to break up. Soon thereafter, a gunman commits mass murder at the hospital, and, relieved to have survived, Torres and Robbins reconcile, with Robbins agreeing that they should have children together.\nWhen Robbins wins a prestigious grant to help treat children in Malawi, a disgruntled Torres agrees to move there with her, as the position will last for three years; however, her lack of enthusiasm causes Robbins to end their relationship and go without her. A heartbroken Torres moves in with Sloan, and they have a one-night stand. Robbins returns for Torres, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness, but Torres initially rebuffs her, and later reveals that she is pregnant with Sloan's baby. Robbins agrees to raise the child with her, but dislikes that Sloan will be a permanent part of their lives. En route for a weekend getaway, Robbins proposes to Torres, but before Torres can reply, the two are in a head-on collision with a truck, leaving Torres severely injured. In an attempt to save her life, obstetrician-gynecologist Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), delivers Torres's premature baby. Torres survives, and agrees to marry Robbins. After twelve weeks of recovery, both Torres and baby Sofia are discharged and allowed to leave the hospital. Torres recovers from her surgery, but deals with the backlash from her mother (Gina Gallego)'s attitude toward the wedding and her granddaughter. Torres and Robbins marry in a garden after the minister's wife falls ill, with general surgeon Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), officiating the ceremony.\nIn the aftermath of a plane accident that killed Sloan and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Torres is forced to make the decision to have Alex Karev amputate Robbins's left leg to keep her alive, which puts strains on their relationship. The hospital is sued and eventually found guilty of negligence. Each victim, including Robbins, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), and Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurances refuse to pay. These doctors and Torres buy the hospital with the help of the Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. Everything seems to go well for Arizona and Callie, until a big storm hits the hospital, now named after Mark Sloan and Lexie Grey. In the last episode of the ninth season, Arizona cheats on Callie with Dr. Lauren Boswell (Hilarie Burton). Callie soon discovers Arizona's infidelity by seeing her wedding ring pinned to Dr. Boswell's scrub top. In the aftermath of discovery, both Callie and Arizona share their feelings and it is revealed that Arizona does not forgive Callie for making the call to amputate her leg. Callie is heartbroken and Arizona states that Callie lost nothing in the crash, to which Callie responds that she, apparently, lost Arizona.\nCallie takes Sofia to live with Meredith and Derek, Zola, and baby Bailey for a while before kicking Arizona out of their apartment and celebrates by dancing in her underwear.

Callie goes to Arizona's apartment and invites her to come back home. Callie finds out during surgery that Arizona was sleeping with Leah, a second year resident, while separated. Although angry at Arizona, Callie still agrees to work things out.\nAfter April's failed wedding to Matthew, Callie and Arizona bought a house together, a fresh start, away from the memories of their apartment. They later decided to try again for a second child. However, a trip to the OB/GYN led to the discovery that Callie had developed adhesions in her uterus in the years since Sofia's birth, meaning she could not carry any more babies. After talking about it, the couple agreed to postpone their dream to have another baby until they're on more solid footing as a couple.\nAt the beginning of the eleventh season, Callie and Arizona gave therapy another chance in order to help mend their marriage.

Hogarth was well known for his satirical works, and The March of the Guards to Finchley has been said to have given full scope to this sense of satire; it was described by Hogarth himself as \"steeped in humour\".The painting is a depiction of a fictional mustering of troops on the Tottenham Court Road to march north to Finchley to defend the capital from the second Jacobite rebellion of 1745, which was part of a series of uprisings that had been occurring since the late 17th century and were aimed at returning the Stuart Dynasty to the throne after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. It portrays the soldiers in a humorous light, placing exaggerated emphasis on their lack of training and respect for discipline.\nThe March of the Guards to Finchley was originally intended to be a gift to the incumbent King of England, George II. However, George was insulted by the apparent jab at his best troops and rejected it when it was offered to him. Upset at the King's spurning of his work, Hogarth opted to change the engraving and present the painting instead to the King of Prussia, Frederick II, who, being known for his skills as a soldier rather than an artist, was reportedly much more satisfied with the gift.", "hasanswer": true}]}

As a result, they have gained a reputation for producing a fair number of intellectuals and several noted lawyers. For several generations they have intermarried with the like-minded Wilkes family. Unfortunately, this practice of apparent inbreeding has eventually resulted in the birth of progressively sicklier children.\nMelanie and Charles' parents die when their children are still young. Their father, Col. William R. Hamilton, was described as a hot-tempered, fiery soldier \"with a ramrod for a backbone\". The two siblings are placed under the joint guardianship of Henry Hamilton and Sarah Jane \"Pittypat\" Hamilton, their father's brother and sister. Neither Henry nor Pittypat are married and so they consider their nephew and niece as their children. Henry is a lawyer and resident of Atlanta and the family fortune has been placed under his management. Pittypat is described as having the maturity of a child herself. The one actually responsible for raising the two children is Uncle Peter, an African American slave. Peter is fiercely loyal to the Hamiltons and has served the orphans' father during his military service in the Mexican\u2013American War.\nThough the Hamiltons are nominally his masters, Peter views them more as his charges and acts as the protector of Pittypat, her niece and nephew throughout their lives. He is described as a brave and intelligent man who, in serving the interests of the Hamiltons, often advises his charges and on several occasions makes decisions for them.

With a pair on each side of each niche, there must initially have been sixteen or twenty such statues planned. This number was reduced in successive designs, to twelve (second version, 1513), eight (third version, 1516) and finally maybe only four (fourth version, 1526, or fifth version, 1532), before being eliminated from the project altogether in the final version of 1542.\nThe first members of the series, who are mentioned in Michelangelo's letters are the two Prigioni of Paris, named the \"Slaves\" in the nineteenth century: the Dying Slave and the Rebellious Slave. They were carved in Rome around 1513.\nThe Florentine Prigioni (Young Slave, Bearded Slave, Atlas Slave and the Awakening Slave) were probably carved instead in the second half of the 1520s, while Michelangelo was employed at San Lorenzo in Florence (but historians suggest dates between 1519 and 1534). It is known that they were in the artist's warehouse on the via Mozza in 1544, when his nephew Leonardo Buonarroti asked permission to sell them (Michelangelo did not visit Florence after 1534). The permission was denied and only in 1564 were they donated, along with the Genius of Victory, to the Grand Duke Cosimo I who placed them at the four corners of the Grotto of Buontalenti in 1591.

Wearing a white bandana in his hat to notify the Texians that he was one of them, he spurred his horse and rode, unmolested, through the Alamo gate as the ring of Mexican soldiers looked on in surprise.  Bonham's news, that Fannin was not coming after all, reportedly demoralized the Alamo garrison.  Travis sent a courier that evening to the convention with news that the Texians had thus far survived the siege with no losses.  He warned, however, that: \"I look to the colonies alone for aid; unless it arrives soon, I shall have to fight the enemy on his own terms. I will, however, do the best I can under the circumstances, and I feel confident that the determined valour and desperate courage, heretofore evinced by my men, will not fail them in the last struggle, and although they may be sacrificed to the vengeance of a Gothic enemy, the victory will cost the enemy so dear, that it will be worse for him than a defeat.\"  Travis ended his letter with news that despite the dearth of ammunition, his men would fire the 18-lb cannon three times each day as proof that they still held the fort.  Travis then wrote several private letters and entrusted all of the communications to John W. Smith, who volunteered to sneak through the enemy lines.According to Lindley's research, other Texians were also determined to join those at the Alamo.  He identified up to 50 of Fannin's men, most of whom had been in Thomas H. Breece's company of New Orleans Greys, who left Goliad to go to the rescue of their former mates.  Lindley believes that on March 3 these men likely joined the advance unit under Chenoweth and Desauque, as well as Seguin and his Tejano unit.  That afternoon, the entire group joined the group waiting at Cibolo Creek, 35 miles (56 km) from the Alamo.  At this point, Lindley calculated that the Alamo should have had approximately 164 effective men.On the afternoon of March 3, reinforcements arrived for Santa Anna's army.  The Zapadores, Aldama, and Toluca battalions arrived between 4 and 5 pm, after marching steadily for days.   The Texians watched from the walls as approximately 1000 Mexican troops, attired in dress uniform, marched into Bexar's military plaza. The Mexican army celebrated loudly throughout the afternoon, both in honor of their reinforcements and at the news that troops under General Jose de Urrea had soundly defeated Texian Colonel Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27.  Most of the Texians in the Alamo had believed that Ramirez y Sesma had been leading the Mexican forces during the siege, and they mistakenly attributed the celebration to the arrival of Santa Anna.  The reinforcements brought the number of Mexican soldiers in Bexar to almost 2,400.During the day, the Mexican army had erected a battery on the north side of the Alamo, within musket shot of the complex walls.\nUnlike previous bombardments, each shot from this battery impacted the walls, causing them to begin to crumble.  By nightfall, part of the wall had begun to collapse, and Jameson kept the men working all night to shore up the walls with pieces of lumber.Almonte's journal reported that there was an engagement after dark on March 3, but that the Mexican troops had repulsed the assault.  Several historians, including Walter Lord, speculated that the Texians were creating a diversion to allow Smith to escape.  However, in 1876, Susannah Dickinson said that Travis sent three men out shortly after dark on March 3, probably in response to the arrival of the Mexican reinforcements.  The three men, who Dickinson believed included Davy Crockett, were sent to find Fannin.  Lindley stated that just before midnight, Crockett and one of the other men found the force of Texians waiting along Cibolo Creek, who had advanced to within 20 miles (32 km) of the Alamo.  Just before daylight on March 4, part of the Texian force managed to break through the Mexican lines and enter the Alamo.  A second group was driven across the prairie by Mexican soldiers.  Lindley based his assumptions on two newspaper reports published within a month of the Alamo's fall that stated that 50 men had reinforced the Alamo a few days before the final assault.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is considered to be Holiday's most important painting. It is executed in oil on canvas, measuring 142.2 centimetres (56 in) by 203.2 centimetres (80 in) and was purchased by the gallery in 1884.When he died in 1927, Holiday was described as \"the last Pre-Raphaelite.\"  Many of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's paintings, including Dante's Dream, had as their subject the Italian poet Dante Alighieri, and this interest is the likely inspiration for Holiday's painting.  It is based on Dante's 1294 autobiographical work La Vita Nuova which describes his love for Beatrice Portinari.  Dante concealed his love by pretending to be attracted to other women.  The painting depicts an incident when Beatrice, having heard gossip relating to this, refuses to speak to him.  The event is shown as Beatrice and two other women walk past the Santa Trinita Bridge in Florence.  Beatrice wears a white dress and walks beside her friend Monna Vanna, with Beatrice's maidservant slightly behind.In 1860 Holiday had painted another scene from La Vita Nuova that showed a meeting between Dante and Beatrice when they were children in the garden of Beatrice's father, and in 1875 he painted a portrait of Dante.  In addition to the completed painting of Dante and Beatrice, the Walker Art Gallery owns three sketches he made for it.  Two of these depict all the figures, while the third is of Dante alone.  Holiday had also made nude plaster statuettes of the two main female figures to which he later added clothing.  These are also owned by the gallery.  The model for Beatrice was Eleanor Butcher, Milly Hughes modelled for Monna Vanna, and the model for the maidservant was Kitty Lushington.Holiday was anxious that the painting should be historically accurate and in 1881 travelled to Florence to carry out research.  He discovered that in the 13th century the Lungarno, the street on the north side of the River Arno between the Ponte Vecchio (seen in the background) and the Ponte Santa Trinita, was paved with bricks and that there were shops in the area; these are shown in the painting.  He also learned that the Ponte Vecchio had been destroyed in a flood in 1235.

She then became associated with weeping and reading: Christ's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful. Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes, associating tears with words, and in turn weeping with reading. Examples can be seen in 16th-century works by Tintoretto and Titian which show the Magdalen reading, often with her eyes averted towards her book (and presumably away from a male gaze), or looking up to the heavens or, sometimes, glancing coyly towards the viewer. Writing in \"The Crying Face\", Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a \"pictorial formula for crying\".\nBy the medieval period, reading became synonymous with devotion, which involved withdrawal from public view. Van der Weyden's placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid-15th century. The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a psalter or book of hours in the privacy of their homes. Whether the Magdalen herself was a reader, by the 17th century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts. Because the Magdalen was present at Christ's death and subsequent resurrection, she was seen as the bearer of news\u2014a witness\u2014and hence directly associated with the text.The Magdalen imagery further draws on the idea of Christ as the word, represented by a book, with the Magdalen as the reader learning of her own life story in a moment of reflection and repentance.  Her devotion to reading reflects her traditional status as the piously repentant harlot, as well as a prophetess or seer.  According to legend, the Magdalen lived the last 30 years of her life as a hermit in Sainte-Baume and is often shown with a book, reading or writing, symbolizing her later years of contemplation and repentance. By the 13th century she acquired the imagery of a once-shamed woman who, clothed in long hair, now hid her nakedness in exile and \"borne by angels, floats between heaven and earth\".The Magdalen's ointment jar was common in the lexicon of art in van der Weyden's period. Mary of Bethany may have used a jar when she repented of her sins at Christ's feet in her home; by the Renaissance, the image of the Magdalen was of the woman who bathed Christ's feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. She signified the \"sacrament of anointing (Chrism and Unction)\" by pouring precious spikenard on Christ's feet at his tomb.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The development process for this memorial started immediately after Abraham Lincoln's assassination and ended, appropriately enough, near the end of Reconstruction in 1876. In many ways, it exemplified and reflected the hopes, dreams, striving, and ultimate failures of reconstruction.\nThe monument has been criticized for its paternalistic character and for not doing justice to the role that African Americans played in their liberation. While the funds for the monument were raised from formerly enslaved people, a white artist conceived the original design. An alternative design depicting Lincoln with uniformed black Union soldiers was rejected as too expensive. According to historian Kirk Savage, a witness to the memorial's dedication recorded Frederick Douglass as saying that the statue \"showed the Negro on his knees when a more manly attitude would have been indicative of freedom\". In a recently uncovered letter from Douglass that appeared in the National Republican five days after the dedication, he said that the monument did not tell the \"whole truth of any subject which it might be designed to illustrate\". Douglass also says that while Lincoln breaks the enslaved person's chains in the monument, the granting of his U.S. citizenship is not represented.\nWhat I want to see before I die is a monument representing the negro, not couchant on his knees like a four-footed animal, but erect on his feet like a man. There is room in Lincoln park for another monument, and I throw out this suggestion to the end that it may be taken up and acted upon.\nJonathan White and Scott Sandage, two historians who rediscovered the letter, detailed their findings in Smithsonian Magazine in June 2020. They saw in it \"a solution to the current impasse\" over the Emancipation Memorial. Since no one statue could provide the whole truth, they suggested enriching the memorial group by adding statues of Charlotte Scott, whose contribution began the process, and Frederick Douglass, who dedicated the original monument, to create a new \"Emancipation Group\", as the monument was sometimes called. Lincoln biographer Sidney Blumenthal noted that the kneeling enslaved man was a widespread abolitionist motif, appearing on the masthead of William Lloyd Garrison's abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jackson does not appear in \"Revelations\". However, it is implied at the end that the breeze SG-1 feels is Daniel. Michael Shanks does appear as the voice of Thor. This is the last episode where Michael Shanks would be listed in the main cast until season seven. Teryl Rothery who portrayed Janet Fraiser does the voice of Heimdall.  According to the episode audio commentary, Rothery performed her lines on-set to help give the actors a reference point. However, Richard Dean Anderson, Christopher Judge and Rothery could not keep a straight face as the eye line they were given was a blinking light in Rothery's chest. This episode ended the SG-1 tradition of ending the season with a cliffhanger until Season 9.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As a member of the Royal House of Llyr, she wears a pendant depicting a silver crescent moon, the family emblem. Far from being just another stereotypical damsel-in-distress princess who needs the hero to save her, Eilonwy is hot-tempered, stubborn, and resolute. Although having been trained as a sorceress and not a warrior, she is quite capable of using various kinds of weapons, particularly the sword, bow, and spear. Even when unarmed, she will fight until incapacitated.\nEilonwy commonly uses unusual similes and metaphors, such as \"If you don't listen to what somebody tells you, it's like putting your fingers in your ears and jumping down a well.\" She is also sharp, snippy, strong-willed, and sarcastic, but at the same time talkative and often scatterbrained. Eilonwy frequently gets angry with Taran, usually for reasons he does not understand, though in secret she does care for him. While she is more sure about her growing feelings towards him than he is about his for her, she is content to wait until he confesses to her, which he does in the end.\nIn the first book of the series, she is described as wearing a white robe and a silver crescent-shaped necklace, which is her family symbol. She seemingly prefers going barefoot over wearing shoes (as noted by Dallben in The Castle of Llyr); when she has to wear shoes (like in The Book of Three), they are invariably sandals. Princess Diahan from Lloyd's earlier novel Time Cat: The Remarkable Journeys of Jason and Gareth, who served as a prototype for Eilonwy, was likewise described as wearing a white robe and sandals.\nEilonwy is voiced by Susan Sheridan in the 1985 Disney animated film The Black Cauldron, which is loosely based on The Chronicles of Prydain. She is portrayed with long blonde hair and light blue eyes. Disney's version of the character also appears in the film's video game, as well in the video game Disney Magic Kingdoms as a playable character.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It's a place I've never been to before that I'm very unfamiliar with. A lot of it is inspired by filmmakers like John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Ridley Scott, because they know how to capture fear. That's what Kiss Land is to me, an environment that's just honest fear. I don't know who I am right now and I'm doing all these outlandish things in these settings that I'm not familiar with. To me, it's the most terrifying thing ever. So when you hear the screams in the record and you hear all these horror references and you feel scared, listen to the music because I want you to feel what I'm feeling. Kiss Land is like a horror movie. He also explained the album's second single \"Belong to the World\", saying: \"Belong to the World\" is about falling in love with the wrong person. There are some songs where I talk about the same person, but I like to make every song about someone else. Thursday is a conceptual album. Whatever that situation was, I spent the whole album focusing on that situation.\" He also explained where the title Kiss Land came from, saying: \"I didn't want to call it Dark World or something so generic.

In the aftermath of Batman: Knightfall, he was not offered the role of Batman while Wayne was recovering from a broken back because he felt that Nightwing was a hero in his own right and not Batman's understudy, but after the events of the Zero Hour miniseries later that year, Grayson temporarily fills in as Batman, beginning in Robin (Vol. 2) #0 (1994) and extending throughout the Batman: Prodigal storyline in 1995. Grayson again assumes the mantle following the events of \"Batman R.I.P.\" (2008) and Final Crisis (2008\u20132009), when Bruce Wayne is presumed dead. As Batman, he moves back to Gotham City and takes on Damian Wayne, who becomes the fifth Robin, as his crime-fighting partner. He also becomes the leader of the Justice League, joined by longtime teammate Donna Troy. Following Wayne's return, both men simultaneously maintain the Batman identity.\nIn 2011, Grayson returned to the Nightwing identity with DC's New 52 publishing event. In 2014, he abandons the Nightwing identity to serve as Agent 37, Batman's mole in the nefarious spy organization Spyral. He returns to being Nightwing as part of the DC Rebirth relaunch in 2016.\nDick Grayson has appeared as Robin in several other media adaptations: the 1943 serial played by Douglas Croft, the 1949 serial played by Johnny Duncan, the 1966\u20131968 live action Batman television series and its motion picture portrayed by Burt Ward, and played by Chris O'Donnell in the 1995 film Batman Forever and its 1997 sequel, Batman & Robin. Dick Grayson appeared in the Titans television series for the DC Universe streaming service and HBO Max played by Brenton Thwaites. Loren Lester voiced the character Robin in Batman: The Animated Series and later as Nightwing's first screen adaptation in The New Batman Adventures, Jesse McCartney voices Grayson as both Robin and Nightwing in Young Justice: The Animated Series, Sean Maher voices Nightwing in the DC Animated Movie Universe, and Michael Cera voices an overly cheerful Grayson as Robin in The Lego Batman Movie. In May 2011, IGN ranked Dick Grayson No. 11 on their list of the \"Top 100 Super Heroes of All Time\".

The single was then included on four of the singer's concert tours: Virgin (1985), Who's That Girl (1987), Confessions (2006), and Rebel Heart (2015\u20132016). On the first one, Madonna wore a black crop top beneath a vest with a silver cross patt\u00e9e, matching fringed gloves and miniskirt, leggings, low-heeled leather boots, and a crucifix earring in one ear. The performance of the song at Detroit's Cobo Arena was included on the Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour video release (1985).\nThe song's performance at the Who's That Girl World Tour found the artist singing underneath a disco ball hung from above the stage. She wore the same black bustier from her \"Open Your Heart\" (1987) video, with her platinum blonde hair done in a big bushy style. From the Chicago Tribune, Scott A. Zamost and Elizabeth Snead felt that, although Madonna's voice sounded strong, she was \"drowned out frequently and annoyingly by an overpowering back-up band\" in numbers such as \"Lucky Star\". Two different performances can be found on the videos Who's That Girl: Live in Japan and Ciao Italia: Live from Italy, filmed in Tokyo on June and in Turin on September, respectively.A \"modernized\" \"Lucky Star\" with a techno beat was sung on the Confessions Tour. Following the performance of \"La Isla Bonita\" (1987), Madonna lies face-down on the stage; afterwards, two backup singers wrap an illuminated white cape with \"Dancing Queen\" embroidered on the back around her and, together, proceed to perform \"Lucky Star\". Towards the end, the original beat of the song slowly begins to morph into \"Hung Up\" (2005), the concert's final number. From The Providence Journal, Rick Massimo opined the song was given \"even more dance thump\". The performance from the August 15-16 London concerts was included on the singer's second live album, The Confessions Tour (2007).On the MDNA Tour (2012), the song was sampled on a video that led to \"Turn Up the Radio\". A slow, cumbia and salsa-fueled medley of \"Dress You Up\", \"Into the Groove\" (1985), and \"Lucky Star\", was included on the Rebel Heart Tour. The number featured Day of the Dead iconography and found Madonna, decked out in a long dress with a black shawl and a black hat, joined by a Mexican-themed dance crew. Billboard's Joe Lynch felt that, \"the maracas might have been a little much, but the crisp Spanish guitar successfully made the songs sound newly organic\".

It is known for certain that he spent the years 1600 to 1608 in Italy, where he became familiar with, and was influenced by, the works of Caravaggio and his students Orazio Gentileschi, Guido Reni and Annibale Carracci. When he returned to Pastrana, he revealed those influences in a \"Trinity\", painted for the side altar at the Monasterio de Concepcionistas Franciscanas.\nIn March 1611, he moved to Toledo and, the following year, painted an \"Altarpiece of the Four Days of Easter\" for the Dominicans, which is now at the Museo del Prado.

A typical episode, on average, would have at least two-thirds of all footage shot on location, as opposed to a \"typical\" show of the time which would be shot largely on sound stages and backlots. It is also remembered for its unusual setting during a time when most crime dramas of the era were set in or around the Los Angeles or New York City areas.\nThe Hawaii-based television show Magnum, P.I. was created after Hawaii Five-O ended its run, in order to make further use of the expensive production facilities created there for Five-O.

Robinson was an experienced actor from a range of different films and television programmes since the 1930s, but was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate, and had difficulty in learning some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver. Robinson's delivery of his lines has been criticised by some later reviewers.Appearing as Quatermass's chief assistant Dr Leo Pugh was Welsh actor Hugh Griffith, who had been an actor on stage and screen since the 1930s, but gained his highest profile roles after Quatermass II; he went on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as Sheikh Ilderim in Ben-Hur (1959). He also appeared in Lucky Jim (1957) and Oliver! (1968).Monica Grey played Paula Quatermass; she was chosen by BBC management rather than the production team, as she was the wife of the BBC's head of radio drama, Val Gielgud. As Hugh Griffith also had problems with some of his technical dialogue, Grey learned his lines as well as her own, in case she needed to step in and assist him during the live performance. Dillon was played by John Stone; Stone too had a long career as a supporting actor in a range of British television series, and in 1956 had a small role in the film X the Unknown, which Hammer Film Productions had intended as a sequel to their version of The Quatermass Experiment, until Kneale denied them the rights to use the character.Four actors who each became well known for a particular role on British television had supporting parts in Quatermass II. Rupert Davies who played MP Vincent Broadhead would go on to find fame as S\u00fbret\u00e9 detective Commissaire Jules Maigret, the title character of 1960s TV series Maigret, based on Georges Simenon's novels. Roger Delgado, who found fame in the 1970s as the Master in Doctor Who (1971\u201373), played a journalist who helps Quatermass before falling victim to \"the mark\" in episode four. Wilfrid Brambell, later star of the sitcom Steptoe and Son (1962\u201374), appeared as a tramp. and Melvyn Hayes, who played the small role of Frankie, later worked in several films with Cliff Richard.Nigel Kneale not only wrote the serial but, previously an actor, had two speaking parts.

Kneale went on to write feature film screenplays such as Look Back in Anger (1958) and First Men in the Moon (1964), as well as continuing to write for television, including two further Quatermass serials, until 1997.Kneale credited the director Rudolph Cartier with bringing to the screen in Quatermass II, with its ambitious location filming, an expansive style that had not been seen in British television drama beforehand. Cartier worked with Kneale again on the third Quatermass serial, Quatermass and the Pit, in 1958, and had subsequent successes with plays such as Anna Karenina (1961), Cross of Iron (1961) and Lee Oswald \u2013 Assassin (1966).

It was commissioned by Catherine Lescuyer as a commemorative piece for her father. Rubens created it as part of an altarpiece in the Church of St. Rombout (Rumbold) in Mechelen. The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas dressed in blue turning back towards the viewer and away from the table. Other than Jesus, the most prominent figure is Judas. Judas holds his right hand to his mouth with his eyes avoiding direct contact with the other figures in the painting creating a nervous expression. Jesus is dressed in red and has a yellow halo surrounding his head with his face tilted upwards. Jesus is located centrally in the painting surrounded by his disciples with six on each side, and he holds a loaf of bread with a cup of wine in front of him. Out of all of the figures, he is the most in the light with the figures to the farthest left being the most in shadow. \u201cThe scene thus represents a perfect conflation of the theological significance of the Last Supper\u201d meaning the conflation between the blessing of the bread and the wine while still being pivotal in the sense of revealing the betrayal.As in many other Northern European depictions, a dog with a bone can be seen in the scene, probably a simple pet. It may represent  faith, dogs are traditionally symbols of and are representing faith. According to J. Richard Judson the dog near Judas perhaps represents greed or evil, as the companion of Judas, as in John 13:27.This painting followed the first unsuccessful attempt by Rubens to produce a Last Supper in 1611, when his patrons backed out the last minute, perhaps due to the high price of 4,000 Guilder asked by Rubens.Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper fresco was a significant influence on Rubens who created an etching after the Davinci Last Supper, which was one of Rubens' first attempts to express the full range of human emotion printed by Pieter Soutman. Rubens was also influenced by his humanist ideals from which he extracts biblical themes.Rubens often made engravings following the completion of his works. Other artists used these engravings to serve as a basis of their own works. These copies were even collected.

Restoration of a piped water supply in turn permitted the construction of several public fountains.   The basin of the Fontana del Nettuno, (without the sculptures), was designed in 1574 by Giacomo Della Porta, who was also responsible for the Moor Fountain at the other side of the square.

In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. The chief exponents of Realism were Gustave Courbet, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, Honor\u00e9 Daumier, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. Jules Bastien-Lepage is closely associated with the beginning of Naturalism, an artistic style that emerged from the later phase of the Realist movement and heralded the arrival of Impressionism.Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of \u00c9mile Zola, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, and Gustave Flaubert.Courbet was the leading proponent of Realism and he challenged the popular history painting that was favored at the state-sponsored art academy.\nHis groundbreaking paintings A Burial at Ornans and The Stonebreakers depicted ordinary people from his native region. Both paintings were done on huge canvases that would typically be used for history paintings. Although Courbet's early works emulated the sophisticated manner of Old Masters such as Rembrandt and Titian, after 1848 he adopted a boldly inelegant style inspired by popular prints, shop signs, and other work of folk artisans. In The Stonebreakers, his first painting to create a controversy, Courbet eschewed the pastoral tradition of representing human subjects in harmony with nature. Rather, he depicted two men juxtaposed against a charmless, stony roadside. The concealment of their faces emphasizes the dehumanizing nature of their monotonous, repetitive labor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In Almond Tree in Blossom, Vincent used the light, broken strokes of impressionism and the dabs of colour of divisionism for a sparkling surface effect.  The distinctive contours of the tree and its position in the foreground recall the formal qualities of Japanese prints.\nThe rendering of Almond Blossom is positioned close and accessible to the viewer and the branches appear to reach out beyond the painting's frame.\nTheo wrote to his brother Vincent on January 31, 1890, to announce the birth of his son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. As a means of celebration, Vincent began work on a painting for Theo and his wife.  He was very close to his brother and he sought to symbolize new life in the flowers of the almond tree for the birth of baby Vincent.Vincent wrote to his mother of the birth of Theo and Jo's baby,\n\nHow glad I was when the news came... I should have greatly preferred him to call the boy after Father, of whom I have been thinking so much these days, instead of after me; but seeing it has now been done, I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, big branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky.\nThe composition is unlike any other of van Gogh's paintings. The branches of the almond tree seem to float against the blue sky and fill the picture plane. The close-up of the branches brings to mind Delacroix's proposition that \"even a part of a thing is kind of a complete entity in itself.\"  Dark lines outline the branches. This is a feature that Van Gogh had admired in Japanese floral studies that, for example, may depict a portion of a stalk of bamboo in an empty space.  The bright color is reflective of the paintings made in Arles and the transformational work van Gogh had on the still life genre.Van Gogh biographer Steven Naifeh speculates that in painting Almond Blossoms, Van Gogh drew inspiration from his friend John Russell's 1887 painting Almond Trees in Blossom.

He is the villain of the piece, as he admits to himself: \"O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven\" (Act III, Scene 3, Line 40), yet his remarkable self-awareness and remorse complicates Claudius's villain status, much like Macbeth. (Abraham Lincoln held that the \"...my offence is rank...\" monologue by Claudius was superior to the \"To be, or not to be\" monologue by Hamlet.) Claudius's fratricide is the corruption permeating the play's world \u2013 that which is, in the words of Marcellus (a guard), \"something \u2026 rotten in the state of Denmark.\" Shakespeare reminds the audience of the crime several times by having characters mention the story of Cain and Abel, including Claudius himself, who admits being inflicted with \"the primal eldest curse.\" Claudius's cruelty is reflected in his schemes to kill Hamlet \u2013 sending him to England to be killed, as well as setting up a rigged fencing match. Claudius is also a heavy drinker, proposing numerous toasts and presiding over a rowdy court; he appropriately succumbs to his own poisoned wine.The king is not without redeeming virtues, though. He is seen to be an able monarch (notwithstanding the unfavourable comparison to his murdered predecessor in Hamlet's first soliloquy) as well as a smart thinker and smooth talker, who in Act IV, Scene 5 converts Laertes from rebel to accomplice. In Act III, Claudius bludgeons, and attempts to pray in Scene 3, even as he realises that he cannot sincerely repent (\"Words without thoughts never to heaven go\"), and eventually continues in his evil ways. Most commentators agree that the king's evil nature is evident, and that the other aspects of his nature exemplify Shakespeare's ability to portray his villains as fully human.The king is named after the Roman emperor Claudius, who was considered the archetype of an evil ruler in Shakespeare's time. The historical Claudius's incestuous marriage to and alleged poisoning by Agrippina the Younger, who was later herself murdered by her son Nero, are mirrored in the play, as Hamlet himself appears to note in Act III, Scene 2: \"Soft! now to my mother. / O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever / The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom ....\"Although the character is referred to as \"Claudius, King of Denmark\" in one stage direction, the name \"Claudius\" is never spoken by any character in the play.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In addition, if the woman Preston chose then chose him in return, Preston would subsequently have the option of choosing a million-dollar prize over her.  The women did not know that Preston had received any of this information.  Some of the female contestants eventually learned the values of their check through competitions within the game.

She was told that she would choose a suitor from among 15 men, and then would have the option of choosing a million-dollar prize over that suitor if he first chose her over a cash prize.  Unbeknownst to her, the same offer was made to Andrea Langi, who also lost a million-dollar check while wooing Preston, and who was in turn unaware of Rachel's presence in the new competition.  The two women only learned that they were still competing against each other right before meeting the male contestants.\nEach of the fifteen men was presented with checks in the same manner as the women had been in season 3.  However, the new twist was that the men were immediately shown the values of their checks while Rachel and Andrea didn't know the values or that the men did know them.  The fifteen men were then introduced to both women and had the opportunity to socialize with them for an evening.  The men were then instructed to choose one of the two women to continue courting.

It is thought to have been a wedding gift from James IV of Scotland or another Scottish nobleman to James's wife Margaret Tudor on the occasion of their marriage, perhaps finishing a book already started for another purpose. A number of artists worked on the extensive programme of decoration, so that \"the manuscript in its entirety presents a rather odd picture of heterogeneity\".  The best known miniature, a full-page portrait of James at prayer before an altar with an altarpiece of Christ and an altar frontal with James's coat-of-arms, gave his name to the Master of James IV of Scotland, who is now generally identified as Gerard Horenbout, court painter to Margaret of Austria; he did only one other miniature in the book.

Probably drawings were sent of the panel portraits in Edinburgh of James III of Scotland and his queen Margaret of Denmark by Hugo van der Goes, since the portrait miniatures show similar iconography.

According to Musicsheets.com, the voice range of Amos' vocals span between G3# to D5# notes, with the publishing key at G Minor. The song is in common time and has been set moderately paced in 100 beats per minute. In the song, Tori represents a \"diosyncratic, staccato vocal style underpinned with Mac Aladdin\u2019s razor-sharp guitar accents, but the song simply meanders, like a walk along the cliffs of Dover.\" Artistdirect said the song features \"organic piano against studio-created synths. It\u2019s a juxtaposition of the organic and the inorganic.\" Music Fix said the song was a \"dreary sounding, works in the context of the album, lying snugly on its bed of electronica immediately after the disarming Give.\"Amos, identifying the song as a \"love song\", stated that her husband Mark Hawley was an inspiration towards the song, who wanted her to move to England with her for more privacy in their personal relationship. She explained to Drowned in Sound that the \"desired goal\" of the song, was \"to be positive about a man, and yet ambivalent about a place.\" Amos added: \"I really wanted the story to be about a woman who left her life, and her family, and her job, to follow her love \u2013 to follow her heart.\" Amos commented on the song's structure; \"The sounds [of \"Welcome to England\"] were created around the feelings and working around the song structure; the structures were demanding certain arrangements. It came out sexy and modern.\"In a UK video interview with ITN, she explains the reasoning behind \"Welcome To England\":\n\n\"Welcome To England\" is really about a woman who has gone to live in her lover's world and it could be from LA to New York, it could be from Manchester to London, and she has left her friends, her family, everything--her job--to go be with him and create a new life. And as she took on his friends, his life, his family, she lost.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She was the second child and first daughter of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark and his first consort, the former Princess Louise of Great Britain, and was named for her grandmother, Queen Sophie Magdalene. She received her own royal household at birth.\nJust one month after her birth, her grandfather King Christian VI died, and Princess Sophie Magdalene's father ascended the throne as King Frederick V. She was the heir presumptive to the throne of Denmark from the death of her elder brother in 1747 until the birth of her second brother in 1749, and retained her status as next in line to the Danish throne after her brother until her marriage. She was therefore often referred to as Crown Princess of Denmark.In the spring of 1751, at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, and she was brought up to be the Queen of Sweden. The marriage was arranged by the Riksdag of the Estates, not by the Swedish royal family. The marriage was arranged as a way of creating peace between Sweden and Denmark, which had a long history of war and which had strained relations following the election of an heir to the Swedish throne in 1743, where the Danish candidate had lost. The engagement was met with some worry from Queen Louise, who feared that her daughter would be mistreated by the Queen of Sweden, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. The match was known to be disliked by the Queen of Sweden, who was in constant conflict with the Parliament; and who was known in Denmark for her pride, dominant personality and hatred of anything Danish, which she demonstrated in her treatment of the Danish ambassadors in Stockholm.After the death of her mother early in her life, Sophia Magdalena was given a very strict and religious upbringing by her grandmother and her stepmother, who considered her father and brother to be morally degenerate. She is noted to have had good relationships with her siblings, her grandmother and her stepmother; her father, however, often frightened her when he came before her drunk, and was reportedly known to set his dogs upon her, causing in her a lifelong phobia.\nIn 1760, the betrothal was again brought up by Denmark, which regarded it as a matter of prestige. The negotiations were made between Denmark and the Swedish Queen, as King Adolf Frederick of Sweden was never considered to be of any more than purely formal importance. Louisa Ulrika favored a match between Gustav and her niece Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt instead, and claimed that she regarded the engagement to be void and forced upon her by Carl Gustaf Tessin. She negotiated with Catherine the Great and her brother Frederick the Great to create some political benefit for Denmark in exchange for a broken engagement. However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, who was very loved for her kindness and charity. This view was supported by the Caps political party, which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika. Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: \"His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen\". In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated.\nWhen a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: \"why Gustav, you seem to be already in love with her! She looks stupid\", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: \"She would suit you better!\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The scene shows Napoleon during a striking scene which is supposed to have occurred in Jaffa on 11 March 1799, depicting the French general making a visit to his ill soldiers at the Armenian Saint Nicholas Monastery. \nThe commission was an attempt to embroider Bonaparte's mythology and quell reports that Napoleon had ordered fifty plague victims in Jaffa be given fatal doses of opium during his retreat from his Syrian expedition. It also served a propaganda purpose in countering reports of French atrocities during their capture of Jaffa. On 18 September 1804, the painting was exhibited at the Salon de Paris, between Napoleon's proclamation as emperor on 18 May and his coronation at Notre-Dame de Paris on 2 December. Dominique Vivant Denon, who participated in Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt and was now director of the mus\u00e9e du Louvre, acted as advisor to Gros on it.
