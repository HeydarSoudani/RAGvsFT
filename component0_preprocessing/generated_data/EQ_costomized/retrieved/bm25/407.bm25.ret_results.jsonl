{"id": "407_2", "question": "Which language was Il ritorno di Tobia written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_5339", "text": "Il ritorno di Tobia (The Return of Tobias) is an oratorio in two parts composed in 1775 by Joseph Haydn (Hob. XXI:1). The work is the first oratorio the composer wrote and, according to Jones, was \"his most extended and ambitious composition up to that time\".The Italian-language libretto of the work is by Giovanni Gastone Boccherini, brother of the composer Luigi Boccherini. This libretto is harshly criticized by Olleson, who notes that the author de-dramatizes vivid episodes in the source (the story of Tobit in the Apocrypha), depriving Haydn of the opportunity for highly dramatic musical utterance.The work was premiered in Vienna on 2 April 1775, under the sponsorship of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, a musician's benevolent society. The musical forces were substantial: Smither writes: \"characteristic of the large forces used for the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t concerts, the orchestra, chorus, and soloists possibly numbered more than 180 performers.\" He adds that the premiere was \"enormously successful.\"In 1784, Haydn substantially revised the work, with cuts to make numbers shorter and new choruses, for another of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t's benefit concerts. It is thought that at this concert Haydn first met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who became his good friend. One of the soprano soloists was Nancy Storace, also a friend of Haydn, who later was Mozart's first Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro.In 1808 the oratorio made a third appearance on the program of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, this time in a revised version by the now-elderly composer's pupil, Sigismund Neukomm. The performance on the night of 22 December, which required the labors of most of the highly qualified musicians in Vienna, had regrettable consequences for a now-famous rival concert taking place in Vienna on the same evening, the benefit for Ludwig van Beethoven that premiered his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies.\nToday, Il ritorno di Tobia is eclipsed by Haydn's later works in this genre \u2013 The Creation and The Seasons \u2013 and is seldom performed or recorded.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Poets associated with his court include William Dunbar, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas. James patronised music at Restalrig using rental money from the King's Wark, and gave his backing to the foundation of King's College, Aberdeen, by his chancellor, William Elphinstone, and St Leonard's College, St Andrews, by his illegitimate son, Alexander, Archbishop of St Andrews, and John Hepburn, Prior of St Andrews. In 1496, partly at Elphinstone's instance, he also passed what has been described as Scotland's first education act, which introduced compulsory education at grammar school for the eldest sons and heirs of all barons and freeholders of substance.\nJames was both highly intelligent and well educated. In July 1498, Spanish ambassador, Pedro de Ayala, reported to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile: The King is 25 years and some months old. He is of noble stature, neither tall nor short, and as handsome in complexion and shape as a man can be. His address is very agreeable. He speaks the following foreign languages: Latin, very well; French, German, Flemish, Italian, and Spanish; Spanish as well as the Marquis, but he pronounces it more distinctly. He likes, very much, to receive Spanish letters. His own Scots language is as different from English as Aragonese from Castilian. The King speaks, besides, the language of the savages who live in some parts of Scotland and on the islands. It is as different from Scots as Biscayan is from Castilian. His knowledge of languages is wonderful. He is well read in the Bible and in some other devout books. He is a good historian. He has read many Latin and French histories, and profited by them, as he has a very good memory. He never cuts his hair or his beard. It becomes him very well.\nJames also ensured that the very best education was given to his illegitimate son, Alexander, who was tutored by Erasmus in Padua, Siena and Rome. James IV allegedly conducted a language deprivation experiment in which two children were sent to be raised by a mute woman alone on the island of Inchkeith, to determine if language was learned or innate.James IV had a wide range of intellectual interests, and took an interest in practical and scientific matters. He patronised the establishment of Scotland's first printing press, Chepman and Myllar Press, in 1507, and granted the Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers of Edinburgh a royal charter in 1506. James was also interested in dentistry, an interest which began in 1503 when the king summoned a 'barbour' to extract one of his teeth for the sum of 14 shillings. In 1504, he sought more practical experience of dentistry and purchased two gold toothpicks suspended from a chain, and \"ane turcase [pincer] to tak out teith\". It is recorded that James pulled two teeth from one of his own barber-surgeons, for which the king paid him 14 shillings, and also tried bloodletting on patients, and treating and dressing ulcer wounds. He also took an interest in other sciences which are now less creditable, establishing an alchemy workshop at Stirling Castle, where alchemist John Damian looked for ways to turn base metals into gold. The project consumed quantities of mercury, golden litharge, and tin. A goldsmith, Matthew Auchinleck, provided the alchemists with a still made of silver. Damian also researched aviation and undertook a failed experiment to fly from the battlements of Stirling Castle, an event which William Dunbar satirised in two separate poems.James poured large amounts of money into the construction or remodelling of several royal residences. He commissioned the construction between 1501 and 1505 of the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The impetus for the work probably came from his marriage to Margaret Tudor, which took place in Holyrood Abbey in August 1503. James also commissioned the construction of Falkland Palace in Fife between 1501 and 1513, on a site to the south of Falkland Castle. At Stirling Castle, James commissioned the construction of the great hall and a new royal lodging (the present-day King's Old Building), the remodelling of the chapel royal, and the reconstruction of the principal defences on the southern and eastern sides of the castle. He also commissioned the construction of the great hall at Edinburgh Castle, rebuilding at Linlithgow Palace, Rothesay Castle, and Dunbar Castle, and furnished his palaces with tapestries.\nThe first evidence of whisky production in Scotland comes from an entry in the Exchequer Rolls for 1494 where malt is sent \"To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae\", enough to make about 500 bottles. James IV reportedly had a great liking for whisky, and in 1506 the town of Dundee purchased a large amount of whisky from the Guild of Barber-Surgeons, which held the monopoly on production at the time.", "hasanswer": false}]}

But he broke the pact, and it cost him his soul. Now, his niece Micki, and her cousin Ryan have inherited the store... and with it, the curse. Now they must get everything back, or the real terror begins.\nAn antique dealer named Lewis Vendredi (played by R. G. Armstrong; \"Vendredi\" means \"Friday\" in French) has made a deal with the Devil to sell cursed antiques out of his shop, \"Vendredi's Antiques\", in exchange for wealth, magic powers, and immortality. In the show's first episode (\"The Inheritance\"), tired of being merely an obedient puppet for the Devil, Lewis rebels against the Devil and breaks the deal, thus being killed and having his soul claimed by the Devil for it.\nAfter Lewis' death, his shop is inherited by his niece, Micki Foster (played by Louise Robey, credited without her first name, as \"Robey\") and her cousin by marriage, Ryan Dallion (played by John D. LeMay). They decide not to keep the store, and sell off many of the cursed antiques before being stopped by Jack Marshak (played by Chris Wiggins). Jack was Lewis's friend, a retired world-traveller and occultist who originally collected many of the antiques for Vendredi before they became cursed.\nThe series follows the protagonists as they hunt down the cursed antiques, which are usually in the possession of people who have discovered their magic powers and are unwilling to give them up. In some cases the object is in the possession of the one who originally discovers its magic power (\"The Inheritance\", \"What a Mother Wouldn't Do\"), while in others (e. g. \"Tales of the Undead\", \"A Cup of Time\", \"Vanity's Mirror\", \"Read My Lips\", \"The Mephisto Ring\", \"The Prisoner\") another person has learned of the object's power and obtained it before the object is recovered. Since the cursed antiques are completely indestructible, they must be locked away in a vault beneath \"Curious Goods\" (the rechristened antique store) that is designed to magically render the objects inert. A manifest, written by Lewis, holds the records of all the cursed objects sold by him.\nMost of the stories in the series deal with people using the cursed objects' magic for personal gain or for revenge. To use the objects' magic powers, a human sacrifice is required, and the victim must be killed by the object itself or in some particular manner related to the object's history. In many episodes, the benefits are only temporary and owner is forced to keep using the object to regain or retain them (\"A Cup of Time\", \"Master of Disguise\", \"Spirit of Television\", \"Face of Evil\", \"Better Off Dead\", \"The Sweetest Sting\"). In some cases, attempting to abandon the object subjects the owner to some unendurable or fatal affliction (\"Stick It in Your Ear\", \"Read My Lips\"). Some objects are sentient and intelligent, such as the doll (\"The Inheritance\") and the radio (\"And Now the News\"). Others do not actually speak but demonstrate intelligence and awareness in other ways (\"Spirit of Television\", \"The Playhouse\") or confer intelligence on other inanimate things (\"Read My Lips\", \"Double Exposure\", \"Wax Magic\"), or summon intelligent, malevolent entities (\"The Pirate's Promise\", \"Femme Fatale\", \"Shadow Boxer\", \"Demon Hunter\"). Still others function without intelligence, mechanically dispensing a certain benefit in response to human sacrifice (\"Root of All Evil\", \"The Mephisto Ring\", \"The Prisoner\", \"Brain Drain\"). Occasionally, there would be an object-free episode in which the trio would confront their uncle's spirit or some other Satanic evildoer (\"The Prophecy\", \"Hellowe'en\", \"Wedding in Black\").\nLike other sci-fi/horror shows in syndication in the late 1980s (such as War of the Worlds and Freddy's Nightmares), Friday the 13th: The Series pushed the limits of \"acceptable content\", featuring violence on par with that of the R-rated horror movies of the time.

Vampyr was funded by Nicolas de Gunzburg who starred in the film under the name of Julian West among a mostly non-professional cast. Gunzburg plays the role of Allan Gray, a student of the occult who enters the village of Courtempierre, which is under the curse of a vampire.\nVampyr was challenging for Dreyer to make as it was his first sound film and was required to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with  title cards like a silent film. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The soundtrack was created in Berlin where the characters\u2019 voices, sound effects, and score were recorded.\nVampyr had a delayed release in Germany and opened to a generally negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut.

Engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), with a team led by Alan Stern, the spacecraft was launched in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system in 2015, and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in the decade to follow, which became a mission to 486958 Arrokoth. It is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System.\nOn January 19, 2006, New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station by an Atlas V rocket directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about 16.26 km/s (10.10 mi/s; 58,500 km/h; 36,400 mph). It was the fastest (average speed with respect to Earth) human-made object ever launched from Earth. It is not the fastest speed recorded for a spacecraft, which, as of 2023, is that of the Parker Solar Probe. After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL, New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter, making its closest approach on February 28, 2007, at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles). The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons' speed; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons' scientific capabilities, returning data about the planet's atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere.\nMost of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve onboard systems, except for brief annual checkouts. On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter, and instrument check-out began. On January 15, 2015, the spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto.\nOn July 14, 2015, at 11:49 UTC, it flew 12,500 km (7,800 mi) above the surface of Pluto, which at the time was 34 AU from the Sun, making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet. In August 2016, New Horizons was reported to have traveled at speeds of more than 84,000 km/h (52,000 mph). On October 25, 2016, at 21:48 UTC, the last recorded data from the Pluto flyby was received from New Horizons. Having completed its flyby of Pluto, New Horizons then maneuvered for a flyby of Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth (then nicknamed Ultima Thule), which occurred on January 1, 2019, when it was 43.4 AU (6.49 billion km; 4.03 billion mi) from the Sun. In August 2018, NASA cited results by Alice on New Horizons to confirm the existence of a \"hydrogen wall\" at the outer edges of the Solar System. This \"wall\" was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft. NASA has announced it is to extend operations for New Horizons until the spacecraft exits the Kuiper Belt, which is expected to occur between 2028 and 2029.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was founded on November 15, 1867, and it is the oldest Argentine newspaper still in circulation, which has gained it the title of Decano de la Prensa Argentina (\"Dean of the Argentine Press\"). \nThe name was chosen by its founder, Ovidio Lagos, as a political statement on the part of those, including him, who were lobbying to move the capital of the federal government to Rosario. Rosario was in fact declared the capital three times by Congress, only to face presidential vetoes each time.\nAt the time of its foundation, La Capital was an afternoon newspaper. Newspapers were just forums of political debate with classified ads. Since the beginning, the heading of La Capital included a motto showing a commitment to public opinion: Las columnas de La Capital pertenecen al pueblo, \"La Capital's columns belong to the people\".\nOn 19 August 1868 the editorial building was at 104 Santa Fe St. After that, La Capital turned into a morning newspaper, and in 1870 it moved to Port St. (now Buenos Aires St.). In 1874 and again in 1887 new printing machinery was acquired. In 1889 the editorial moved to a new building at 763 Sarmiento St. and acquired a French Marinoni reaction printer.\nIn 1903 the newspaper changed the format of its pages, abandoning the large sheet sizes. By 1905 the daily edition had 16 pages, and in 1906 it offered a full-color 28-page illustrated supplement.\nFor 111 years, since its foundation, the newspaper employed the \"hot type\" method, that is, with Linotype typesetting machines where molten lead and antimony were used to cast each line of text. In 1978 La Capital shifted to \"cold type\", using the phototypesetting method.\nIn mid-1998 the new publishing plant at Santiago St. near Rivadavia Ave. received its latest innovation, a Goss Urbanite rotating press which weighs 165 tonnes and measures almost 36 m in length. The new plant also features a number of other technologies. Using this, La Capital started a new edition, with a different layout and format, and fully in color.\nBesides national and international news, the newspaper covers local news from Rosario and its metropolitan area (Greater Rosario), plus other towns in the region and four other provinces besides Santa Fe, reaching about 2 million readers.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The area controlled by the Britons was progressively reduced by the expansion of Wessex after the 6th century, and in 936 Athelstan set the east bank of the Tamar as the boundary between Anglo-Saxon Wessex and Celtic Cornwall. The Cornish language continued to flourish during the Middle Ages but declined thereafter, and the last speaker of traditional Cornish died in the 19th century. Geographical names derived from the British language are widespread in South West England, and include several examples of the River Avon, from abon\u0101 = \"river\" (cf. Welsh afon), and the words \"tor\" and \"combe\".Until the 19th century, the West Country and its dialects of the English language were largely protected from outside influences, due to its relative geographical isolation. The West Country dialects derive not from a corrupted form of modern English, but from the Southwestern dialects of Middle English, which themselves derived from the dialects of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. Late West Saxon, which formed the earliest English language standard, from the time of King Alfred until the late 11th century, is the form in which the majority of Anglo-Saxon texts are preserved. Thomas Spencer Baynes claimed in 1856 that, due to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the Somerset dialect. There is some influence from the Welsh and Cornish languages, depending on the specific location.\nWest Country dialects are commonly represented as \"Mummerset\", a kind of catchall southern rural accent invented for broadcasting.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The CBC operates four terrestrial radio networks: The English-language CBC Radio One and CBC Music, and the French-language Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re and Ici Musique (international radio service Radio Canada International historically transmitted via shortwave radio, but since 2012 its content is only available as podcasts on its website). The CBC also operates two terrestrial television networks, the English-language CBC Television and the French-language Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9, along with the satellite/cable networks CBC News Network, Ici RDI, Ici Explora, Documentary Channel (partial ownership), and Ici ARTV. The CBC operates services for the Canadian Arctic under the names CBC North, and Radio-Canada Nord. The CBC also operates digital services including CBC.ca/Ici.Radio-Canada.ca, CBC Radio 3, CBC Music/ICI.mu, and Ici.TOU.TV.\nCBC/Radio-Canada offers programming in English, French, and eight indigenous languages on its domestic radio service, and in five languages on its web-based international radio service, Radio Canada International (RCI). However, budget cuts in the early 2010s have contributed to the corporation reducing its service via the airwaves, discontinuing RCI's shortwave broadcasts as well as terrestrial television broadcasts in all communities served by network-owned rebroadcast transmitters, including communities not subject to Canada's over-the-air digital television transition.\nThe CBC's federal funding is supplemented by revenue from commercial advertising on its television broadcasts. The radio service employed commercials from its inception to 1974, but since then its primary radio networks have been commercial-free. In 2013, the CBC's secondary radio networks, CBC Music and Ici Musique, introduced limited advertising of up to four minutes an hour, but this was discontinued in 2016.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film was written by Dreyer and Christen Jul based on elements from J. Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 collection of supernatural stories In a Glass Darkly. Vampyr was funded by Nicolas de Gunzburg who starred in the film under the name of Julian West among a mostly non-professional cast. Gunzburg plays the role of Allan Gray, a student of the occult who enters the village of Courtempierre, which is under the curse of a vampire.\nVampyr was challenging for Dreyer to make as it was his first sound film and was required to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with  title cards like a silent film. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The soundtrack was created in Berlin where the characters\u2019 voices, sound effects, and score were recorded.\nVampyr had a delayed release in Germany and opened to a generally negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut. The film was long considered a low point in Dreyer's career, but modern critical reception to the film has become much more favorable with critics praising the film's disorienting visual effects and atmosphere.", "hasanswer": false}]}

[...] It's hard to take a body count of all those ideas which freefall off every page but then 'the thing to do is to walk in circles.' And occasionally pause. . . .\" In The New York Times Book Review, Thomas R. Edwards deemed End Zone an improvement over Americana and said that the writing \"is continuously energetic, shifty, fun to watch for its own sake.\u201d Edwards also argued that \"[Gary's] fever, casually introduced in the final paragraph, hints at the uncertain but possible value of vulnerability, persisting without certitude in a world where others accept defensive systems \u2014technologies, religion, games, the large or small cultisms that flourish where fear is.\u201dAnya Taylor at The City University of New York argued the book would endure, especially praising Gary's desert meditation on the end zone. Taylor discussed how the novel dramatizes certain limitations of language and negative social phenomena involving language (such as the covering of unpleasant truths through euphemisms, or the prevention of meaningful interaction through over-reliance on simplistic maxims), and interpreted the novel as \"a book about the decline of language under the bombardment of terms from thermonuclear warfare, and an attempt to revive language through an ascetic disciplined ritual of silence and self-loss\". Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of The New York Times stated that End Zone confirmed DeLillo as one of the best young writers of his time, writing that the author was skilled at building scenes for comedic effect and praising the football game that is considered the novel's centerpiece as well as the pick-up game in the snow.Bill Beckett of The Harvard Crimson was less positive. While writing that End Zone has perhaps the best extended account of a football game ever written, and that the novel shows the author's \"golden ear for the tin and tinsel of Americanese\", Beckett also argued that \"even isolated good satire can't hold together a disappointingly anticlimactic novel. DeLillo's buildup of suspense finally dissipates totally; many ominous hints are lost or forgotten by the end. [...] A season in the chaotic life of Gary Harkness, interesting as he is, does not suffice to make a satisfying whole.\"Chad Harbach lauded End Zone in 2004 as \"a wonderful and underrated novel\". Daniel Roberts highly praised the novel in a 2018 retrospective for The Paris Review, where he wrote, \"No novel nails the omnipresent violence of football better than End Zone\". In 2007, however, the novel was listed by New York as one of the DeLillo's works that is \"for fans only\": \"There\u2019s little plot to speak of in this second novel, just a series of hilarious riffs on the parallels between football and nuclear war. That\u2019s not the most original comparison to draw, and the ending\u2014or rather, the lack of one\u2014makes it an ultimately unsatisfying read.\"  In 2011, Martin Amis listed End Zone among his favorite novels in DeLillo\u2019s output. Jeff Somers conversely ranked it 10th out of 17 of the author\u2019s books, arguing that it was extremely funny but also that \"there\u2019s not much of a story here, and after meandering about for a while, it sort of just stops dead in its tracks.\"\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

The two main macro groups in the Horn are the Cushitic-speaking Cushitic peoples traditionally centered in the lowlands and the Ethiosemitic-speaking Ethiopian Highlanders and Eritrean Highlanders centered in the highlands.\nAccording to Ethnologue, there are 10 individual languages spoken in Djibouti (two native), 14 in Eritrea, 90 in Ethiopia, 15 in Somalia (Somali being the only native). Most people in the Horn speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic, Semitic, or Omotic branches. The Cushitic branch includes Oromo, spoken by the Oromo people in Ethiopia, and Somali, spoken by the Somali people in Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya; the Semitic branch (specifically the Ethiosemitic sub-branch) includes Amharic, spoken by the Amhara people of Ethiopia, and Tigrinya spoken by the Tigrayan people of Ethiopia and the Tigrinya people of Eritrea. Other Afroasiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Afar, Saho, Hadiyya, Sidamo and Agaw languages, the Semitic Tigre, Arabic, Gurage, Harari, Silt'e and Argobba tongues as well as Omotic languages are spoken by Omotic communities inhabiting Ethiopia's southern regions. Among these languages are Aari, Dizi, Gamo, Kafa, Hamer and Wolaytta.\nLanguages belonging to the Nilo-Saharan language family are also spoken in some areas by Nilotic ethnic minorities mostly in Ethiopia and Eritrea. These tongues include the Nilo-Saharan Me'en and Mursi languages used in southwestern Ethiopia, and Kunama and Nara idioms spoken in parts of southern Eritrea.\nLanguages belonging to the Niger-Congo language family are also spoken in some areas by Bantu ethnic minorities in Somalia. In the riverine and littoral areas of southern Somalia, Bajuni, Barawani, and Bantu groups also speak variants of the Niger-Congo Swahili and Mushunguli languages.The Horn has produced numerous indigenous writing systems. Among these is Ge'ez script (\u130d\u12d5\u12dd G\u0259\u02bf\u0259z) (also known as Ethiopic), which has been written in for at least 2000 years. It is an abugida script that was originally developed to write the Ge'ez language. In speech communities that use it, such as the Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is called fid\u00e4l (\u134a\u12f0\u120d), which means \"script\" or \"alphabet\".\nFor centuries, Somali sheikhs and Sultans used wadaad's writing (a version of the Arabic alphabet) to write. In the early 20th century, in response to a national campaign to settle on a writing script for the Somali language (which had long since lost its ancient script), Osman Yusuf Kenadid, a Somali poet and remote cousin of the Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo, devised a phonetically sophisticated alphabet called Osmanya (also known as far soomaali; Osmanya: \ud801\udc8d\ud801\udc96\ud801\udc87 \ud801\udc88\ud801\udc9d\ud801\udc91\ud801\udc9b\ud801\udc90\ud801\udc98) for representing the sounds of Somali.

{"id": "407_104", "question": "Which language was Battle of Brunanburh written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_5741", "text": "The style of the poem has been described as \"sagalike in its sparse use of language combined with ample specific detail.\" According to George Anderson, since the poem comes so late in the Old English period, it gives evidence of the continuing attraction of the \"warrior tradition\": it is \"clear and convincing testimony to the vitality of the Old English battle-epic tradition; the authentic ring sounds out years after the Beowulf Poet, Caedmon, and Cynewulf have been laid to rest.\" Donald Fry compares passages from Beowulf and Brunanburh (concerning the boarding of ships) and remarks on the \"similar diction and imagery\". According to Malcolm Godden, the language resembles that of the Old English Genesis A. The poem is not without its detractors: an early critic, Walter J. Sedgefield, in a 1904 study of the poems in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, said \"even the longest and best written of their number, the Battle of Brunanburh, is but a simulacrum, a ghost of the older epos\". That the poem should not be treated as a historical text, and that panegyric was the appropriate genre, was argued by Alistair Campbell: \"The poet's subjects are the praise of heroes and the glory of victory. When this is realised, the oft-repeated criticism, that he does not greatly add to our knowledge of the battle, falls to the ground. It was not his object to do so. He was not writing an epic or a 'ballad.' He was writing a panegyric.\" Townend agrees, and notes that praise-poems on contemporary men are completely missing from the Anglo-Saxon period until a cluster of four panegyrics including Brunanburh in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.Compared to \"The Battle of Maldon\", an Old English poem that commemorates a battle between English and Vikings half a century later, Brunanburh is notable for its nationalist overtones, whereas Maldon celebrates Christian over non-Christian values. Indeed, the poem is seen as celebrating a logical progression in the development of England as a unified nation ruled by the House of Wessex; the battle reports \"the dawning of a sense of nationality, ....a crisis in which a nation is involved\". In this respect, Brunanburh is closer to the Anglo-Saxon poem The Taking of the Five Boroughs, also found in the Chronicle under the year 942, celebrating King Edmund's recapture of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. But while the poet claims veracity, Michael Swanton notes, \"it is ironic in view of his primarily historic concerns that he is in fact more successful than the Maldon-poet in transmitting the traditional poetic style.\" Peter Clemoes argues in Interactions of Thought and Language in Old English Poetry that Brunanburh, as opposed to Maldon, relies on \"uncomplicated patriotic triumphalism\". The poem does not treat \"personal responsibility\" as Maldon does, but leans on an expansive view of history which sees the battle, in line with the Chronicle's view of contemporary history as the \"epitome of Anglo-Saxon, especially West Saxon, history with antecedents in the history of Britain\", as \"straightforwardly traditional\". According to Patrick Wormald, the poem builds on the \"sense of ideological identity that the English had been given by Bede.\"\nThis poet from the 10th century is recalling the Germanic conquest of England which occurred in the 5th century; he connects his memory of this present victory, which must have been very moving for the Saxons \u2014 for it was more common for the Norse to defeat them, and rare for them to be the victors \u2014 he linked it to the often secular victories enjoyed by the first Germanic peoples who arrived in England.\nAccompanying the combatants are the usual \"beasts of battle\" found in other Old English poems\u2014the wolf, the raven, and the eagle.

Dredd and his rookie partner, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey high-rise block of apartments and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).\nGarland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new Judge Dredd film adaptation, unrelated to the 1995 film Judge Dredd, was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio DNA Films, Dredd began principal photography, using 3D cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on practical sets and locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg.\nDredd was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action sequences, while criticism focused on excessive violence as well as a perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30\u201345 million. Dredd saw greater success following its home release and has since been recognised as a cult film.

The plot of Mlada was adapted, with a new time and place, from a ballet by Filippo Taglioni entitled The Shadow (French: L'Ombre, Russian: \u0422\u0463\u043d\u044c, Tye\u00f1 ), which premiered in 1839 in Saint Petersburg.\nSerov died, however, in 1871 before composing anything for the work. Gedeonov revised his conception as an opera-ballet, with a libretto by Viktor Kr\u00eflov, and in 1872 proposed through Vladimir Stasov a collaborative effort by four members of The Mighty Handful\u2014C\u00e9sar Cui, Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, Modest Mussorgsky, and Aleksandr Borodin\u2014who were to write music for the sung portions of the libretto and dramatic action. Ludwig Minkus, at that time the Bolshoy Kamenniy Theatre's First Imperial Ballet Composer, was to write ballet music to be inserted at various points.\nRimsky-Korsakov provides the following details concerning the work's genesis in his memoirs, Chronicle of My Musical Life, 1909:\n\n\"Gedeonov, Director of the Imperial Theatres at the time, had conceived the idea of producing a work which should combine ballet, opera and spectacle. For this purpose he had written the program of a stage performance in four acts on a subject borrowed from the Elbe slavs and had commissioned V. A. Kr\u00eflov to work up the text. Mlada, with its mixture of fantasy and everyday reality, was a most grateful subject for musical treatment. Gedeonov asked Cui, Borodin, Mussorgsky, and myself to compose music for it; moreover, Minkus, the official ballet composer of the Imperial Theatres, was to compose the incidental ballet music. Who the initiator of this order was, I do not know. I suspect here the influence of Lukashevich, an official of the Board of Directors of the Theatres, who had begun to gain power under Gedeonov... I also believe that the connection had not happened without V. V. Stasov's having something to do with it. The four of us were invited to Gedeonov's for a joint deliberation on the work. Act 1, as the most dramatic, was entrusted to the most dramatic composer\u2014Cui; Act 4, a mixture of the dramatic and poetic, to Borodin; Acts 2 and 3 were distributed between Mussorgsky and myself. Some portions of Act 2 (folk-wise choruses) were assigned to me; the first half of Act 3 (flight of shadows and appearance of Mlada) was reserved for me; while Mussorgsky undertook the second half\u2014appearance of Chernobog, for which he wanted to utilize his Night on Bald Mountain, heretofore unused.The thought of Mlada and the few sketches I made for it took me away from The Maid of Pskov and the work on The Stone Guest. Cui composed the whole first act of Mlada rather rapidly. Borodin, who had been somewhat disappointed in writing Prince Igor, now took much of the suitable material from it, composed some new music also, and thus wrote almost the whole draft of Act 4. Mussorgsky composed the 'March of the Princes' on a Russian theme (subsequently published separately, with the 'Trio alla Turca'), as well as some other portions of Act 2; he also made suitable changes in his Night on the Bare Mountain and adapted it for Chernobog's appearance in Act 3 of Mlada. On the other hand, my notes of the chorus in Act 2 and the flight of shadows in Act 3 were still uncompleted and nothing would come of them, owing to a certain haziness and indefiniteness in the task of writing music to a scenario insufficiently worked out.Gedeonov's scheme was not destined to be realized. Soon he left the post of Director of the Imperial Theatres and vanished from sight. The Mlada affair dropped into oblivion, and all of us turned to the work we had left for it; whatever we had composed for Mlada found its way into other compositions later.\"\n\nAlthough the music was for the most part completed, the work was never staged. To date there is no published edition that collates the original manuscripts containing all the extant music composed for the Mlada of 1872.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Iizuka stated that \"This game is like going into the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland, an action game where you can experience many strange and fun experiences.\"Development ultimately focused on the Wii U and 3DS because of the success of previous Sonic games on Nintendo platforms. Because Wii U \"has two monitors to use\", Sonic Team decided to include both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The Wii U GamePad's touch screen and gyroscope were employed to activate the returning Color Powers. The 3DS version, co-developed with Dimps, was designed to \"fully utilize\" the 3DS hardware with 3D gameplay and motion controls. Development was harder on 3DS due to its more limited processing power. Iizuka stated that the Color Powers are \"essential\" to the level design of the 3DS version, while they work as an \"additional tool\" in the Wii U version. A simple art style was used to make objects stand out more against the backgrounds, and to keep the game running at a consistent 60 frames per second. The design of the new \"Deadly Six\" villains was based on that of an ogre, and each one's appearance was intended to reflect a certain key characteristic of their personality, which the developers hoped players could see \"just by looking at them.\" The Wii U version of the game was directed by Morio Kishimoto, the director of Sonic Colors and the lead designer of Sonic and the Black Knight, while the 3DS version was directed by Takao Hirabayashi, the director of Sonic Colors DS, and previously lead designer of Sonic Unleashed PS2/Wii.Sega trademarked the title Sonic Lost World in May 2013. The game was revealed on May 17, 2013, in a Nintendo Direct announcement, as part of an exclusive partnership between Sega and Nintendo for the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It is one of three games in this partnership, the other ones being the fourth entry to the Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series, and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal, a game based on the Sonic Boom animated series. Sega reported that more on the game would be revealed before E3 2013, and that the game would contain both returning and new original characters, both in enemies and friends of Sonic. The first trailer for the game was released on May 28, a day earlier than previously announced. A downloadable demo of the game's first stage was made available for both consoles on October 9 in Japan and in mid-November in North America and Europe. To promote the release of Sonic Lost World, Hardlight released an update for Sonic Dash that includes a boss battle against Zazz, one of the Deadly Six. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U also includes a stage based on Windy Hill Zone from the game.\nThe soundtrack was composed and directed by Tomoya Ohtani, with Takahito Eguchi handling the orchestration and cutscene music. Naofumi Hataya also contributed a single piece, the theme for \"Desert Ruins Zone - Act 3\". A three-disc soundtrack, Sonic Lost World Original Soundtrack Without Boundaries, was released physically in Japan and digitally worldwide via iTunes and Amazon Music on November 27, 2013.A special, limited stock \"Deadly Six\" edition of the Wii U version of the game was available for pre-order, which included special \"Nightmare\" downloadable content (DLC), featuring a new stage and boss battles based on one of Sonic Team's previous games, Nights into Dreams. Clearing the DLC unlocks a special Color Power, the Black Bomb, normally only obtainable via Miiverse. Pre-ordering the game from Amazon.com allowed the player to start off with twenty-five extra lives.A patch for the Wii U version was released on December 10, 2013, adding additional features such as button controls for some Wisps and the traditional extra life reward for collecting 100 rings. On December 18, 2013, Nintendo announced two exclusive pieces of free DLC for the Wii U version based on other Nintendo games. The first DLC stage, \"Yoshi's Island Zone\", was released on the day of the announcement, with a second installment, \"The Legend of Zelda Zone\", released on March 27, 2014.

The service itself has been covered by GMA Network news in segments on two of the station's daily news programs.Many of its observers on the blogging community and Tambayan Philippines, the Philippine Wikipedia regional notice board, have observed that it is \"trying to be everything all at once: magazine, putative encyclopedia, pluralistic community forum, soapbox-for-a-day, rumor rag, fight club. It is a pastische of different entities, each of which has been successful on its own, but it remains to be seen whether they will be as successful when smashed together. It is less an organic fusion as it is an unnatural pile-up of knowledge-sharing methodologies taken from Euro-America. In many ways, it is symptomatic and representative of the Philippine condition.\"Upon learning of its inception, a few Filipino bloggers questioned the usefulness of WikiPilipinas as a fork of Wikipedia. In a post entitled \"Is There Any Point to Wikipiniana?\", a Filipino blogger weighed the pros and cons of having an encyclopedia administered to entirely by Filipinos. Filipino blogger and Wikipedian Eugene Alvin Villar questioned the usefulness and purpose of WikiPilipinas in a blog post on July 19, 2007. He argued that the \"hip and free encyclopedia\"'s policy on articles not needing to adhere to a neutral point of view (as Wikipedia does) was not conducive to an unbiased encyclopedia. With WikiPilipinas being marketed as an encyclopedia \"by Filipinos, for Filipinos,\" Villar pointed out the great possibility of bias in the encyclopedia's articles. Aside from the possibility of bias, he also mentioned that the articles of WikiPilipinas were less likely to rank higher than those of the English Wikipedia in web searches, making effort spent in updating WikiPilipinas articles better spent working on their equivalent Wikipedia articles. He later reiterated some of these concerns in an interview with the Manila Bulletin in September. In the interview, he criticized WikiPilipinas for prioritizing publicity over streamlining the site's policies and guidelines. Notable Filipino blogger Abraham Olandres personally mentioned Villar's criticism of WikiPilipinas. In his post, Olandres agreed that the Filipino-based service would be useless and redundant unless it \"came up with its own set of content\". In a later entry, Olandres pointed out that WikiPilipinas' lack of a notability guideline could possibly slant it towards a Filipino-centric sense of pseudo-notability.Kristine Mandigma, the president of the Philippine literacy advocacy group Read-or-Die Foundation, also made a commentary on WikiPilipinas after attending the service's August 22 official press launch. She described WikiPilipinas as \"the online version of an omnium gatherum\u2026 a motley and captivating assortment of ideas, facts and factoids, emotions, dissertations, and agonized biographies.\"The site's credibility was questioned in line with a possible connection to Vibal Publishing House, a local publishing service that was implicated in a controversial textbook scandal. Both the publishing company and WikiPilipinas are owned by the same person, Gaspar Vibal. In an interview with the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Vibal asserted that the wiki project and the publishing house were independent of each other.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The initial series of sessions in 1978 only produced one track which would appear on the album (\"Something's On the Move\") with guitarist Martin Barre mentioning in a 1979 interview that \"we completed an album's worth of material, then we went away to America-- and when we got back, we listened to it again and it was not there at all. So, we decided to start again.\" In early 1979, the band recorded for the album while Ian Anderson, keyboardist/arranger David Palmer (now Dee Palmer) and Barre simultaneously wrote music for The Water's Edge, a commissioned program for the Scottish Ballet. Some of the music written for The Water's Edge would later develop into tracks on Stormwatch, such as \"Elegy\" and \"Dark Ages\".Most of the album was recorded at Anderson's Maison Rogue Studios in Fulham, London, although some sessions took place at Morgan Studios, Townhouse Studios and the Maison Rogue Mobile studio at Anderson's home due to recording time not always being available for the band at Maison Rogue. Like the band's previous album Heavy Horses, much of Stormwatch was recorded late at night, as daytime hours at Maison Rogue were usually left open for other bands. Thames Television meteorologist Francis Wilson performs a spoken word piece at the beginning of \"Dun Ringill\".\nJethro Tull bassist John Glascock only plays on three of the album's tracks (\"Orion\", \"Flying Dutchman\" and \"Elegy\"), as a result of Anderson dismissing him from the recording sessions in May 1979 due to Glascock's medical issues affecting his playing. Anderson described the dismissal of Glascock as being in the interest of his own health and nothing personal: \"Somebody had to be the tough guy and the nature of my hard message to him was, \"John, I really don't think you can carry on working on this album, you've really got to go and get straightened out... I don't want you to come in tomorrow, go away and get yourself well.'\" Anderson chose to play bass on the rest of the album as opposed to hiring a session musician, saying \"It was no big deal -- anybody can play the bass. It's only four strings after all!\" Some of the album's tracks were recorded with Anderson and drummer Barrie \"Barriemore\" Barlow recording a rhythm track together which the rest of the band would overdub their parts over. Several songs were recorded for the album but then cut from the final track listing, including songs which would later be released as B-sides or on future compilations, such as \"Crossword\", \"Kelpie\" and \"A Stitch in Time\".The instrumental piece \"Elegy\" which closes the album was written entirely by Palmer, making it one of the few Jethro Tull songs written without the involvement of Anderson.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The play contains music and songs that evoke the spirit of enchantment on the island. It explores many themes, including magic, betrayal, revenge, and family. In Act IV, a wedding masque serves as a play-within-a-play, and contributes spectacle, allegory, and elevated language.\nAlthough The Tempest is listed in the First Folio as the first of Shakespeare's comedies, it deals with both tragic and comic themes, and modern criticism has created a category of romance for this and others of Shakespeare's late plays.

The historical setting can range from being quite specific and important to the story, to being vaguely-defined, anachronistic, or mainly for use as a backdrop. Elements of fantasy, such as the use of magic powers and appearance of supernatural beings, are common in some wuxia stories but are not a prerequisite of the wuxia genre. However, the martial arts element is a definite part of a wuxia tale, as the characters must know some form of martial arts. Themes of romance are also strongly featured in some wuxia tales.\nA typical wuxia story features a young male protagonist who experiences a tragedy \u2013 such as the loss of his loved ones \u2013 and goes on to undertake several trials and tribulations to learn several forms of martial arts from various fighters. At the end of the story, he emerges as a powerful fighter whom few can equal. He uses his abilities to follow the code of xia and mends the ills of the jianghu. For instance, the opening chapters of some of Jin Yong's works follow a certain pattern: a tragic event occurs, usually one that costs the lives of the newly introduced characters, and then it sets events into motion that will culminate in the primary action of the story.Other stories use different structures. For instance, the protagonist is denied admission into a martial arts school. He experiences hardships and trains secretly and waits until there is an opportunity for him to show off his skills and surprise those who initially looked down on him. Some stories feature a mature hero with powerful martial arts abilities confronting an equally powerful antagonist as his nemesis. The plot will gradually meander to a final dramatic showdown between the protagonist and his nemesis. These types of stories were prevalent during the era of anti-Qing revolutionaries.Certain stories have unique plots, such as those by Gu Long and Huang Yi. Gu Long's works have an element of mystery and are written like detective stories. The protagonist, usually a formidable martial artist and intelligent problem-solver, embarks on a quest to solve a mystery such as a murder case. Huang Yi's stories are blended with science fiction.\nDespite these genre-blending elements, wuxia is primarily a historical genre of fiction. Notwithstanding this, wuxia writers openly admit that they are unable to capture the entire history of a course of events and instead choose to structure their stories along the pattern of the protagonist's progression from childhood to adulthood instead. The progression may be symbolic rather than literal, as observed in Jin Yong's The Smiling, Proud Wanderer, where Linghu Chong progresses from childish concerns and dalliances into much more adult ones as his unwavering loyalty repeatedly thrusts him into the rocks of betrayal at the hands of his inhumane master.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Vampyr was funded by Nicolas de Gunzburg who starred in the film under the name of Julian West among a mostly non-professional cast. Gunzburg plays the role of Allan Gray, a student of the occult who enters the village of Courtempierre, which is under the curse of a vampire.\nVampyr was challenging for Dreyer to make as it was his first sound film and was required to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with  title cards like a silent film.

The soundtrack was created in Berlin where the characters\u2019 voices, sound effects, and score were recorded.\nVampyr had a delayed release in Germany and opened to a generally negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut.

The piece was developed through improvisation with actors and experimentation, led by Brook and Hughes.Brook's and Hughes' purpose in using these languages was to communicate with the audience in pure sound, in a mode in which meaning is conveyed in such a way that is intended to transcend rational discourse. According to his own descriptions, Brook's goals are related to those of sacred and ritual theater. Believing \"the essence of theater to be magic,\" Orghast was supposed to bring the audience to alternate modes of consciousness, either \"beyond themselves or below themselves.\"\nDirected by Peter Brook in collaboration with  Arby Ovanesian (Iran), Geoffrey Reeves (England) and Andrei \u0218erban (Romania);\nStage Set: Eugene Lee (US), Franne Lee (USA), and Jean Monod (Switzerland).The story of this production is documented in a book by A.

The song captured a musical style that Dion would utilize in the future: sweeping, classical and soft rock influenced ballads with soft instrumentation. Both a critical and commercial smash, the song became her second United States top 10 hit, and also won many awards. As with Dion's earlier releases, the album had an overtone of love.\nDion worked with a new team of writers and producers on her eponymous album. Five songs were written by Diane Warren. \"With This Tear\" was a gift from Prince who wrote the song especially for Dion. The tracks were produced mainly by Walter Afanasieff, Ric Wake and Guy Roche.\nBy 1992, the release of her previous English-language album Unison (1990) and Celine Dion, as well as various media appearances, had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the anglophone market and establishing fame. Apart from her rising success, there were also changes in Dion's personal life, as Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil would make the transition from manager to lover. However, the relationship was kept a secret as both feared that the public would find the twenty-six-year difference between their ages incongruous.\nThe European version of Celine Dion includes \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\" as a bonus track. The album was re-released on 7 September 1992 in Australia with a bonus disc containing four songs which had been previously released as singles from Unison.\n\"Send Me a Lover\" was a \"leftover\" from the recording sessions of the Celine Dion album and it was released in 1994 on the charity compilation Kumbaya Album 1994.\nTo support it, Dion toured as the opening act for Michael Bolton on his \"Time, Love and Tenderness Tour\" in the summer of 1992 through the United States.

The Finnish-language album, incorporating electro and synthpop elements along with melancholic piano ballads, is named after the island Seili (Sj\u00e4l\u00f6 in Swedish), located off the south-west coast of Finland. The album was produced and co-written by Jukka Immonen with Vartiainen writing also two of the songs. The main lyricists were Teemu Brunila and Mariska who contributed to the thematical dualism of the album\u2014Brunila wrote the happier songs about publicity and finding love while Mariska wrote the lyrics for the songs that deal with darker and more serious themes, such as death. Another lyricist was Paula Vesala (from the pop rock duo PMMP).

The author makes a clear distinction between what is written to be seen and/or heard (theater, cinema, television, radio, opera and to a lesser extent comic books) and what is written to be read (literature).\nThe book's principle is the same as Aristotle's Poetics. Yves Lavandier examines works by major scriptwriters and playwrights (Samuel Beckett, Bertolt Brecht, Charles Chaplin, Herg\u00e9, Alfred Hitchcock, Henrik Ibsen, Ernst Lubitsch, Moli\u00e8re, Dino Risi, William Shakespeare, Sophocles, Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, etc.) in order to answer three questions:\n\nwhat do dramatic works consist of?\nwhy is this so?\nhow does one go about writing them?The author scans all the tools of dramatic narrative: conflict, protagonist, obstacles, suspense, characterisation, three-act structure, preparation, dramatic irony, comedy, activity, dialogue. A play written by Moli\u00e8re, The School for Wives, and a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, North by Northwest, are analysed in detail. Several appendices deal with writing for children, drama and literature, short films, documentaries, etc.\nIn the course of pages, Yves Lavandier develops several governing ideas. According to him:\n\nDrama preexists theater and film. Life being full of conflicts and ruled by causality, one can say that life is Aristotelian.\nThe art of narrative can be taught, like every other human activity.\nIt takes two to speak the language of drama: writer and receiver. This is why dramatic irony\u2014which consists in giving the audience an item of information that at least one of the characters is unaware of\u2014is a fundamental mechanism, omnipresent in all genres (tragedy, comedy, melodrama, suspense, thriller, etc.) and all types of narratives.\nAll the great storytellers know the rules of narration, at least unconsciously.\nOne can respect the rules and take the spectator into account while keeping one's liberty and authenticity.\nRules are called \u201crecipes\u201d by those who fear or despise them.\nDrama should not be placed in the same basket as literature, Moli\u00e8re and William Shakespeare beside Gustave Flaubert and Franz Kafka.\nDialogue, in theater or radio, is the visible part of the iceberg. Even in radio, structure and characterisation are paramount.\nTheater is, as well as film, an art of the image.\nTo write a good story, three things are needed: conflict, conflict and conflict.\nThe spectacular and the sensational are cheap ways to generate emotion and often mingle with voyeurism and omnipotence.\nWhen an actor is brilliant, he, of course, deserves all the plaudits he gets. But praise is also due to the director who directed him as well as to the writer who created his role in the first place.\nThe most powerful language of drama is structure, far before dialogue.\nNonetheless, the dialogue is inevitable when one tells a human story, even in silent movies where dialogues were numerous, either written on intertitles or guessed by the audience.\nThe three-act structure (dramatic acts, not logistical ones) relies simply on a universal triad: before-during-after. One can find the three-act structure in the vast majority of dramatic works, including in a narrative as deconstructed as 21 Grams.\nSuspense should not be mistaken with mystery, Alfred Hitchcock with Agatha Christie.\nComedy is a noble, useful and difficult treatment. Its lightness is only an appearance, politeness.\nAs the mockery of human limitations, comedy may be disparaging but also demanding or compassionate.\nThe basics of the narrative are the pattern of a fractal structure.\nTV series are highly respectable and can produce masterpieces of human art such as The Sopranos.\nChildren need good drama. To write for children is a wonderful school of narration.\nWriters of drama will always be indispensable and keep on responding to a triple human need of emotion, meaning and distraction.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The names became anglicised following the conquest. Over the centuries the spelling of the Jack surname has changed and developed as the French language became increasingly associated with high culture and status. Several European kings have thus adopted the name. Jack appears in the records spelled as Jacques, Jaques, Jack, Jacks, Jackes, Jakes, Jeeks, Jeke, Jeex, Jaquiss, Jaquez and Jaquis, with spelling variations even occurring in documents referring to the same person. There are several explanations for this situation. Latin, as a language used by educated men, and the language of the Anglo-Saxons both had a profound impact on the spelling and pronunciation of Norman names. On the other hand, the Norman language affected the development of English. As the English language developed from its Germanic roots into Middle English (which was influenced by Norman French) we find a period during which spelling was not standardised but roughly followed phonetic pronunciation. During this time names were spelled a variety of ways depending upon local dialects. Thus the surname, as well as the Anglo-Saxon names, were recorded in many different ways.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Paranoid was recorded at Regent Sound Studios and Island Studios in London, England.The album's title track was written as an afterthought. As drummer Bill Ward explains: \"We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony [Iommi] just played the guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom.\" In the liner notes to the 1998 live album Reunion, bassist Geezer Butler recounts to Phil Alexander that they wrote the song \"in five minutes, then I sat down and wrote the lyrics as quickly as I could. It was all done in about two hours.\" According to Alexander, \"Paranoid\" \"crystallized the band's writing process, with Iommi initiating the ideas with his charred riffs, Ozzy [Osbourne] working on a melody, Geezer providing drive and the majority of the lyrics, and Bill Ward locking into a set of often pounding rhythms beneath Butler's bass rumble.\" The single was released in August 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit.Most of the songs on Paranoid evolved during onstage improvisational jams. In the Classic Albums documentary on the making of Paranoid, guitarist Tony Iommi recalls that \"War Pigs\" came from \"one of the clubs\" with Butler adding, \"During the song \"Warning\" we used to jam that out and that particular night when we were jamming it out Tony just went da-dum!\" In the same documentary, Iommi demonstrates his approach to the guitar solo in the song, explaining that \"I always tried to keep the bottom string ringing so it fills it out nicely.\" On \"Planet Caravan\", Osbourne sings through a Leslie speaker, with the singer telling Mojo in 2010, \"Then Rodger Bain used an oscillator on it \u2013 whatever that is.

Portuguese documents typically referred to heavy infantry, considered nobles, as fidalgos in documents. The bearing of a shield was also important, as Portuguese documents usually called the heavy infantry as adargueiros (shield bearers). The shields of the heavy infantry extended from the knees unto the neck of the soldier but this force lacked armor. Most shield bearers bore a \"scimitar-shaped longsword\" as described by military historian Wayne Lee. Shield bearers were limited by number and approximately 1000 were deployed in most Kongo armies.  Some archers, especially those in eastern Kongo, used poison arrows. There is weak evidence to suggest revenue assignments paid and supported them. A large number, perhaps as many as 20,000, stayed in the capital. Smaller contingents lived in the major provinces under the command of provincial rulers. Kongo imported European arms such as swords into the military. In 1583, soldiers of the Mbamba province were armed with longswords similar to that of the Slavonians. Portuguese emissary Duarte Lopez believed this sword \"could cut a slave in two.\"After 1600, civil war became far more common than inter-state warfare. The government instituted a draft for the entire population during wartime, but only a limited number actually served. Many who did not carry arms instead carried baggage and supplies. Thousands of women supported armies on the move. Administrators expected soldiers to have two weeks' worth of food upon reporting for campaign duty. Logistical difficulties probably limited both the size of armies and their capacity to operate for extended periods. Some Portuguese sources suggested that the king of Kongo fielded armies as large as 70,000 soldiers for a 1665 Battle of Mbwila, but it is unlikely that armies larger than 20\u201330,000 troops could be raised for military campaigns.Troops were mobilized and reviewed on Saint James' Day, 25 July, when taxes were also collected. Subjects celebrated this day in honor of Saint James and Afonso I, whose miraculous victory over his brother in 1509 was the principal significance of the holiday in the Kongo.When the Portuguese arrived in Kongo they were immediately added as a mercenary force, probably under their own commander, and used special-purpose weapons, like crossbows and muskets, to add force to the normal Kongo order of battle. Their initial impact was muted; Afonso complained in a letter of 1514 that they had not been very effective in a war he waged against Munza, a Mbundu rebel, the year before. By the 1580s, however, a musketeer corps, which was locally raised from resident Portuguese and their Kongo-mesti\u00e7o (mixed race) offspring, was a regular part of the main Kongo army in the capital. Provincial armies had some musketeers; for example, they served against the Portuguese invading army in 1622. Three hundred and sixty musketeers served in the Kongo army against the Portuguese at the Battle of Mbwila. Kongolese forces became accustomed to firearms in the 18th century. Primary sources about the battle between regent of King Pedro V and Jose I in 1781 indicated that Jose's 30,000 soldiers were armed with \"musket and ball.\" Artillery was used to an extent in the 18th century. According to historian Thornton, a Kongolese unit that faced Portuguese forces in 1790 sometimes employed artillery.In 1509, Afonso I of Kongo built holes containing an iron each in defense of Mbanza-Kongo where they were dug to fortify and surround the city. Its main purpose was to attract the opponent's forces to the central public square of the city where most of the army was assembled. Rival and brother of Afonso, Mpanzu a Kitima, succumbed to this anti-personnel trap during a campaign against Afonso. Sources from the early 16th century document about Central African naval vessels carved from a single log which could carry 150 people. In the 16th century, Kongo was recorded to be able to deploy 800 of such naval vessels. In 1525, one of such boats cooperated with a Portuguese vessel to capture a French ship off the coast of Soyo. The Kongolese vessel played the role of capturing and attacking the shore party from a longboat.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Interviewed in 2014, the composer Harrison Birtwistle declared that Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre \"is the kind of piece, in all the noise of contemporary music that's gone on in my lifetime, I'd like to have written\". Another British composer, George Benjamin, described the work as \"a breakthrough. It is a work in which you can also hear the profound influence of extra-European music, above all from Asia and Africa. This radically alters the sonority and the music's sense of time and direction, as well as its expressive viewpoint and ethos\". One of the most enthusiastic and influential early testimonials came from Igor Stravinsky, who praised the work as an exemplar of \"a new and wonderfully supple kind of music\".However, according to Howard Goodall, the sixty years since its premi\u00e8re have failed to grant Le marteau an equally enthusiastic endorsement from the general public. \"While Boulez's iconoclasm was attractive to some students of twentieth-century classical music, who venerated\u2026 Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre,\u2026 most neutral listeners then as now found both his polemic and his music thoroughly impenetrable\". Despite its attractive surface, its \"smooth sheen of pretty sounds\", issues remain about the music's deeper comprehensibility for the ordinary listener. Even Stravinsky's ear struggled to hear some of the work's polyphonic textures: \"One follows the line of only a single instrument and is content to be 'aware of' the others. Perhaps later the second line and the third will be familiar, but one mustn't try to hear them in the tonal-harmonic sense\". But if we are supposed not to listen in the tonal-harmonic sense, what exactly is it that we should hear and understand in a work which, in the words of Alex Ross, features \"nothing so vulgar as a melody or a steady beat\"? Stravinsky said that repeated hearings, through the availability of recordings, would aid performers more quickly to overcome technical difficulties presented by the music: \"If a work like Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre had been written before the present era of recording it would have reached young musicians outside of the principal cities only years later. As it is this same Marteau, considered so difficult to perform a few years ago, is now within the technique of many players, thanks to their being taught by record\".\nWriting some 40 years since Le Marteau first appeared, composer and music psychologist Fred Lerdahl criticized Koblyakov's approach to analyzing Le Marteau: For one thing, competent listeners to Le Marteau, even after many hearings, still cannot even begin to hear its serial organization, ... [though] [e]xperienced listeners do not find Le Marteau totally incomprehensible. ... Of course a musician of Boulez's calibre would not use a compositional system without drawing crucially upon his musical intuition and experience. Music-generating algorithms alone have always produced primitive outputs; not enough is known about musical composition and cognition for them to succeed. Boulez had the intellectually less ambitious goal of developing a system that could just produce a quantity of musical material having a certain consistency. He then shaped his material more or less intuitively, using both his \"ear\" and various unacknowledged constraints. In so doing, he listened much as another listener might. The organization deciphered by Koblyakov was just a means, and not the only one, towards an artistic end. Lerdahl cautions, however, that \"There is no obvious relationship between the comprehensibility of a piece and its value\". While considering \"complicatedness to be a neutral value and complexity to be a positive one\", and therefore that only musical surfaces leading to complexity employ \"the full potential of our cognitive resources\", many kinds of music satisfy such criteria (e.g., Indian raga, Japanese koto, jazz, and most Western art music), while other types \"fall short\": Balinese gamelan because of its \"primitive pitch space\" and rock music on grounds of \"insufficient complexity\", while much contemporary music (without specific reference to Boulez) \"pursues complicatedness as compensation for a lack of complexity\".Roger Scruton finds Boulez's preoccupation with timbre and sonority in the instrumental writing has the effect of preventing \"simultaneities from coalescing as chords\". As a result, Scruton says that, especially where pitches are concerned, Le Marteau \"contains no recognizable material \u2013 no units of significance that can live outside the work that produces them\". Scruton also feels that the involved overlapping metres notated in the score beg \"a real question as to whether we hear the result as a rhythm at all\". Richard Taruskin found \"Le Marteau exemplified the lack of concern on the part of modernist composers for the comprehensibility of their music\". Equally bluntly, Christopher Small, writing in 1987 said \"It is not possible to invoke any 'inevitable time lag' which is supposed to be required for the assimilation of ...such critically acclaimed works as... Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre... Those who champion 'the new music' await its assimilation into the repertory much as the early Christians awaited the Second Coming\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The songs are used to open the gate between the deities and the human world and invite the spirits to possess someone. The rituals of Louisiana Voodoo are based on African traditions that have absorbed various Christian, and especially Roman Catholic, influences. Reflecting this Roman Catholic influence, some recorded ceremonies have for instance begun with the recitation of the Apostles Creed and prayers to the Virgin Mary.It has been claimed that St John's Eve (23 June) has particular significance in Louisiana Voodoo, with big celebrations on this date has taken place on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain during the 19th century. Some 21st-century Voodoo congregations continue to celebrate on St John's Eve; others, such as Osbey, reject the idea that St John's Eve is important in Louisiana Voodoo. Various contemporary practitioners celebrate All Saints Day (1 November) which they, following Haitian Vodou, link with the lwa Gede.In the 21st century, various Voodoo groups wear white clothing for their ceremonies. Influenced by Haitian Vodou, those assembled may dance around a central post, the poto mitan. Patterned flags, called drapos, may be brought out, while songs are sung in Haitian Kreyol. Drawings, called v\u00e8v\u00e8 , may be made on the floor to invoke the spirits. Offerings will be given to the spirits. Contemporary Voodoo rites often entail calling spirits to enter the body of a practitioner, through which they can heal or confer blessings. The possessed individual will be called the \"horse\".Practitioners sometimes performed rituals to deal with specific issues; in August 1995, Voodoo practitioners held a ritual in the Bywater area of New Orleans to try to drive away crack cocaine abuse, burglaries, prostitution, and assaults, while in 2001 the Voodoo priestess Ava Kay Jones performed a rite to drive harmful spirits away from the New Orleans Saints football team in the hope of improving their performance.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The follow-up single \"She's So Cold\" was a top 30 hit while \"Dance Pt. 1\" reached No. 9 on Billboard's Dance chart.\nCritical reception was relatively muted, with most reviewers considering the album somewhat formulaic and unambitious, particularly in contrast to its predecessor.

{"id": "407_226", "question": "Which language was Walker written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_5741", "text": "The style of the poem has been described as \"sagalike in its sparse use of language combined with ample specific detail.\" According to George Anderson, since the poem comes so late in the Old English period, it gives evidence of the continuing attraction of the \"warrior tradition\": it is \"clear and convincing testimony to the vitality of the Old English battle-epic tradition; the authentic ring sounds out years after the Beowulf Poet, Caedmon, and Cynewulf have been laid to rest.\" Donald Fry compares passages from Beowulf and Brunanburh (concerning the boarding of ships) and remarks on the \"similar diction and imagery\". According to Malcolm Godden, the language resembles that of the Old English Genesis A. The poem is not without its detractors: an early critic, Walter J. Sedgefield, in a 1904 study of the poems in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, said \"even the longest and best written of their number, the Battle of Brunanburh, is but a simulacrum, a ghost of the older epos\". That the poem should not be treated as a historical text, and that panegyric was the appropriate genre, was argued by Alistair Campbell: \"The poet's subjects are the praise of heroes and the glory of victory. When this is realised, the oft-repeated criticism, that he does not greatly add to our knowledge of the battle, falls to the ground. It was not his object to do so. He was not writing an epic or a 'ballad.' He was writing a panegyric.\" Townend agrees, and notes that praise-poems on contemporary men are completely missing from the Anglo-Saxon period until a cluster of four panegyrics including Brunanburh in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.Compared to \"The Battle of Maldon\", an Old English poem that commemorates a battle between English and Vikings half a century later, Brunanburh is notable for its nationalist overtones, whereas Maldon celebrates Christian over non-Christian values. Indeed, the poem is seen as celebrating a logical progression in the development of England as a unified nation ruled by the House of Wessex; the battle reports \"the dawning of a sense of nationality, ....a crisis in which a nation is involved\". In this respect, Brunanburh is closer to the Anglo-Saxon poem The Taking of the Five Boroughs, also found in the Chronicle under the year 942, celebrating King Edmund's recapture of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. But while the poet claims veracity, Michael Swanton notes, \"it is ironic in view of his primarily historic concerns that he is in fact more successful than the Maldon-poet in transmitting the traditional poetic style.\" Peter Clemoes argues in Interactions of Thought and Language in Old English Poetry that Brunanburh, as opposed to Maldon, relies on \"uncomplicated patriotic triumphalism\". The poem does not treat \"personal responsibility\" as Maldon does, but leans on an expansive view of history which sees the battle, in line with the Chronicle's view of contemporary history as the \"epitome of Anglo-Saxon, especially West Saxon, history with antecedents in the history of Britain\", as \"straightforwardly traditional\". According to Patrick Wormald, the poem builds on the \"sense of ideological identity that the English had been given by Bede.\"\nThis poet from the 10th century is recalling the Germanic conquest of England which occurred in the 5th century; he connects his memory of this present victory, which must have been very moving for the Saxons \u2014 for it was more common for the Norse to defeat them, and rare for them to be the victors \u2014 he linked it to the often secular victories enjoyed by the first Germanic peoples who arrived in England.\nAccompanying the combatants are the usual \"beasts of battle\" found in other Old English poems\u2014the wolf, the raven, and the eagle. The Battle of Brunanburh, however, seems to include a fourth animal, the gu\u00fehafoc (literally Goshawk), or \"war-hawk,\" in line 64. However, editors and scholars of the poem have suggested that graedigne gu\u00fehafoc, \"greedy war-hawk\", is actually a kenning for the hasu-padan, / earn \u00e6ftan hwit, the \"dusky coated, white-tailed eagle\" of lines 62b-63a.Simon Walker suggests that was written at Worcester, under the influence of its bishop, Koenwald, and that the emphasis on Edmund's contribution suggests that it was written during his reign.

It was released on May 11, 1999, by Columbia Records. Following the release of four Spanish-language albums, and the huge success of his fourth studio album, Vuelve (1998), Martin announced the recording of his first English language album. He worked with producers KC Porter, Robi Rosa, and Desmond Child to create the album. Musically, Ricky Martin consists of dance-pop tracks, power ballads, mid-tempo pop songs, and rock numbers. After the album's release, Martin embarked on the worldwide Livin' la Vida Loca Tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2000 by a Latin artist.\nThe album was supported by four singles. The lead single \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" topped the charts in more than 20 countries and is considered to be Martin's biggest hit and one of the best-selling singles of all time. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five consecutive weeks, becoming Martin's first number one single on the chart. Follow-up singles \"She's All I Ever Had\", \"Shake Your Bon-Bon\", and \"Private Emotion\" became number one and top 10 hits around the world.

It also has a Spanish version titled \"Bella\" (transl.\u2009\"Beautiful\"). Martin dedicated the track to his grandmother who died a year earlier. \"Shake Your Bon-Bon\" is a salsa party track and features a mix of pop, R&B, Middle Eastern riffs, and Latin horns, as well as a fusion of Latin percussion with retro organ.

In addition, Use Your Illusion II is more political than most of their previous work, with songs like \"Civil War\", a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\", and \"Get in the Ring\" dealing respectively with the topics of violence, law enforcement and media bias. The thematic material deals less with drug use than previous Guns N' Roses albums. Use Your Illusion I featured several songs pre-Appetite for Destruction while Use Your Illusion II featured more tracks written during and after Appetite for Destruction.\nThe band's cover of \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" had been released almost a year earlier on the Days of Thunder soundtrack, while \"Civil War\" debuted at the 1990 Farm Aid concert. That concert also featured Guns N' Roses playing a cover of the U.K. Subs song \"Down on the Farm\", a studio version of which would later appear on the band's 1993 release of cover songs, \"The Spaghetti Incident?\". \"Civil War\" was released as a B-side to \"You Could Be Mine\". The song had also been released on the charity album Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal, a fund-raising compilation for Romanian orphans.\n\"You Could Be Mine\" was released in June 1991 and is featured in the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The song was not released on the actual soundtrack. The band also filmed a video featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in character as the Terminator, with a loose plot featuring Axl Rose as its \"target\". However, he is saved from termination as he is deemed a \"waste of ammo\" by the T-800's lock-on system. The original subject matter of the song dealt with Izzy Stradlin's failed relationship with ex-girlfriend Angela Nicoletti.\nThe Use Your Illusion albums can be considered a single cohesive work, and certain elements of Use Your Illusion II underscore this intent. For instance, both albums have a version of the song \"Don't Cry\", and both have one cover song; \"Live and Let Die\" by Paul McCartney (Use Your Illusion I) and \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" by Bob Dylan (Use Your Illusion II). Each also has at least one track sung by other members of the band: lead vocals are performed by bassist Duff McKagan on \"So Fine\", a song that was dedicated to punk rock musician Johnny Thunders, who died from a drug overdose before the recording of the album.The song \"Get in the Ring\" finds the band lashing out at a career's worth of critics and enemies. Among those referred to by name are editors of several entertainment magazines. The industrial flavored \"My World\", the final track, was written and recorded in three hours, with Rose claiming those in the recording room were on mushrooms at the time.The band had some difficulty achieving the final sound, especially during the mixing stages of both albums. According to a 1991 cover story by Rolling Stone magazine, after mixing 21 tracks with engineer/producer Bob Clearmountain, the band fired Clearmountain when he tried to replace the real drums with samples. According to Slash's autobiography, \"one afternoon we discovered a notepad of his where he'd notated all the drum samples he planned to mix in over Matt's drum tracks\" the band decided to scrap the mixes and start from scratch with engineer Bill Price of Sex Pistols fame.Slash has stated that most of the material for the album was written on acoustic guitars in a couple of nights at his house (the Walnut House), after several months of non-productivity. According to Slash \"Breakdown\" was one of the most complicated songs to record on the album; the banjo, drum, and piano parts were hard to synchronize and drummer Matt Sorum \"lost it\" a couple of times trying to get the drums just right. The song \"Locomotive\" was written in a house Slash and Izzy Stradlin rented in the Hollywood Hills following the Appetite for Destruction tours. The song shows the group dabbling in funk metal, and is also the only song on either album where the phrase \"use your illusion\" appears as a lyric.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When it was introduced, many programs were written in assembly language, so having a \"programmer-friendly\" instruction set was important. In time, as more programs were written in high-level programming languages, the instruction set became less visible, and the only ones much concerned about it were compiler writers.\nOne unusual aspect of the VAX instruction set is the presence of register masks at the start of each subprogram. These are arbitrary bit patterns that specify, when control is passed to the subprogram, which registers are to be preserved. On most architectures, it is up to the compiler to produce instructions to save out the needed data, typically using the call stack for temporary storage. On the VAX, with 16 registers, this might require 16 instructions to save the data and another 16 to restore it. Using the mask, a single 16-bit value performs the same operations internally in hardware, saving time and memory.Since register masks are a form of data embedded within the executable code, they can make linear parsing of the machine code difficult. This can complicate optimization techniques that are applied on machine code.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They stress that this was not a \"borrowed\" Naturalism but rather a record of life as experienced by the writer. Moreover, Reymont never formulated an aesthetic of his writing. In that, he resembled other Polish autodidacts such as Miko\u0142aj Rej and Aleksander Fredro. With little higher education and inability to read another language, Reymont realized that it was his knowledge of grounded reality, not literary theory, that was his strong suit.\nHis novel Komediantka paints the drama of a rebellious girl from the provinces who joins a traveling theatre troupe and finds, instead of escape from the mendacity of her native surroundings, a nest of intrigue and sham. In Fermenty, a sequel to Komediantka, the heroine, rescued after a suicide attempt, returns to her family and accepts the burden of existence. Aware that dreams and ideas do not come true, she marries a nouveau riche who is in love with her.\nZiemia Obiecana (The Promised Land), possibly Reymont's best-known novel, is a social panorama of the city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a during the industrial revolution, full of dramatic detail, presented as an arena of the struggle for survival. In the novel, the city destroys those who accept the rules of the \"rat race\", as well as those who do not. The moral gangrene equally affects the three main characters, a German, a Jew, and a Pole. This dark vision of cynicism, illustrating the bestial qualities of men and the law of the jungle, where ethics, noble ideas and holy feelings turn against those who believe in them, are, as the author intended, at the same time a denunciation of industrialisation and urbanisation.\nZiemia Obiecana has been translated into at least 15 languages and two film adaptations\u2014one in 1927, directed by A. W\u0119gierski and A. Hertz, the other, in 1975, directed  by Andrzej Wajda.\nIn Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. It is authentic and written in the local dialect. Reymont uses dialect in dialogues and in narration, creating a kind of a universal language of Polish peasants. Thanks to this, he presents the colourful reality of the \"spoken\" culture of the people better than any other author. He set the action in Lipce, a real village which he came to know during his work on the railway near Skierniewice, and restricted the time of events to ten months in the unspecified \"now\" of the 19th century. It is not history that determines the rhythm of country life, but the \"unspecified time\" of eternal returns. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality.\nThe titles of the volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality. It is easy to point to moments of Naturalism (e.g., some erotic elements) or to illustrative motives characteristic of Symbolism. It is equally easy to prove the Realistic values of the novel. None of the \"isms\" however, would be enough to describe it. The novel was filmed twice (directed by E. Modzelewski in 1922 and by J.

The music was written by Aleksandra Pakhmutova, with lyrics by Nikolai Dobronravov and Sergey Grebennikov.\"Tenderness\" was one of the most beloved songs from cosmonaut of the USSR, and the most beloved \u2014 the first cosmonaut of the planet Earth \u2014 Yuri Gagarin. Yevgeny Dolmatovsky recalled in the book \"Stories about your songs\" (1973):\n\"Tenderness\" is like a spell of a woman, a friend of the pilot, who released her beloved to the stars and is waiting for his return. The source of the song is the hour and a half that it took Yuri Gagarin to fly around the globe, the hours and minutes that other cosmonauts and <test-pilot> Georgy Mosolov spent on daring flights. It is not by chance that the poets Grebennikov and Dobronravov remembered Exup\u00e9ry. One of the first to talk ably about the experiences and feelings of a man who has gained wings, this dreamer and warrior, and cosmonauts, including Yuri Gagarin, often told poets: write about Exup\u00e9ry!In order for a song to be born and turned out, many circumstances, impressions, finds are needed. It is important to remember that Yuri Gagarin brought the authors to the song \"Tenderness\". He loved this song very much, sang it together with his comrades, specially went to listen \u2014 so that not on the radio, not on TV, but here, next to it, it sounded.\nNezhnost' was performed in 1967 by Tatiana Doronina (as Nyura) in Tatiana Lioznova's film Tri topolya na Plyushchikhe (Three Poplars at Plyuschikha Street). Originally it was recorded by Maya Kristalinskaya in 1966. According to the memoirs of Chermen Kasaev (music editor of Radio in the Soviet Union and Soviet Central Television), when listening to a final record, Maya had tears dripping from her eyes. B. Serebrennikova wrote in the book \"Singers of Soviet Pop\" (1977) that \"All critics who wrote about \"Tenderness\" noted that this is the pinnacle of Kristalinskaya's art and in general a masterpiece of song performance creativity.\"It was covered many times by many artists in Soviet Union and Russia, including versions made by Yuri Gulyayev, Joseph Kobzon, Tamara Sinyavskaya, Lyudmila Zykina, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Tamara Gverdtsiteli, Maria Codrianu, Latvian singer Olga P\u012br\u0101gs.

{"id": "407_296", "question": "Which language was Hackett written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "407_6480", "text": "The Hackett surname originates in England. Most textbooks discussing the origin of English surnames theorize that the surname Hackett has Norman origins. The name Hacker is derived from the medieval given names Hack or Hake. These English names are derivatives of the Old Norse name Haki, which is a cognate of the English name Hook. The name Haket de Ridefort was recorded in Lincolnshire in the year 1160. The name can also be found in poll tax records in Yorkshire dating back to 1158 and the name 'Hake' is still popular in Yorkshire as well. The name was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as 'Hako'. The name 'Haket' was also recorded in 1160 in Lincolnshire and the name 'Hacke' was recorded in England in 1218. Another possible origin of the name is that it derives from the Middle English word 'haket', a kind of fish. This suggests that the name could've been an occupational name for fisherman. Mabil Hacket was recorded in the Hundred Rolls in 1273.Hackett is a common surname in the Midlands region. The village Cofton Hackett in Worcestershire is named after William de Haket, who held land there around 1166. The name is particularly common in Warwickshire ranking as the 140th most common surname in the county, as well as Staffordshire (194th), and Northamptonshire (200th). Outside of the Midlands, the name is also popular in the East of England being the 161st most common surname in Suffolk and the 250th most common surname in Cambridgeshire, as well as being popular in South East England. The name is the 149th most commons surname in East Sussex and the 208th most common name in Buckinghamshire.\nMany Hacketts in Ireland were English Protestants and were prominent members of society during the Protestant Ascendancy. Several Hacketts and Hakets appear in the lists of sheriffs of Counties Tipperary and Waterford and as members of parliament for Fethard up through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Notable examples include Sir Thomas Hackett who was Lord Mayor of Dublin, Thomas Hacket  an Anglican bishop who was educated at Trinity College Dublin in the 1600s, Sir John Winthrop Hackett a prominent  newspaper proprietor, politician and university chancellor and various Hacketts who were members of the Parliament of Ireland.\nThe Hackett name first migrated to Ireland at the time of the Anglo-Norman invasion in 1170. Members of the Hackett family accompanied Richard \"Strongbow\" de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke during his invasion of Ireland. The Hacketts were subsequently granted estates in the modern counties of Kilkenny, Carlow and Kildare and thus became the principal holders of land and one of the most influential families in Ireland. As a result, several towns have taken the Hackett name, including Hacketstown, in County Carlow.  Further, the Fiants of Henry VIII and Edward VI indicate that in the sixteenth century there were also Hacketstowns, or Ballyhackett, in Counties Dublin and Kildare.\nA branch of the Hacketts moved into Connacht, where, in due course, they became hibernicized and, like other Norman families of that province, formed a distinct if small sept which was known as MacHackett, their seat being Castle Hackett, six miles south-east of Tuam. Yet, in modern times, there has been little trace of the name Hackett in Connacht or usage of the name MacHackett in general. The Hackett name is still strong, however, in and around Counties Tipperary and Kilkenny.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Megatokyo debuted on August 14, 2000, and has been written and illustrated solely by Gallagher since July 17, 2002. Gallagher's style of writing and illustration is heavily influenced by Japanese manga. Megatokyo is freely available on its official website.  The intended schedule for updates was for postings twice a week, but new comics are typically posted just once or twice a quarter on non-specific days. In 2011, updates began being delayed further due to the health issues of Sarah Gallagher (Seraphim), Gallagher's wife. Megatokyo was published in book-format by CMX, although the first three volumes were published by Dark Horse. For February 2005, sales of the comic's third printed volume were ranked third on BookScan's list of graphic novels sold in bookstores, then the best showing for an original English-language manga.Set in a fictional version of Tokyo, Megatokyo portrays the adventures of Piro, a young fan of anime and manga, and his friend Largo, an American video game enthusiast. The comic often parodies and comments on the archetypes and clich\u00e9s of anime, manga, dating sims, arcade and video games, occasionally making direct references to real-world works.

Whilst reading Natural Sciences as an undergraduate at St John's College, University of Cambridge, Sach was contacted by the Christian Union who challenged him to think about whether or not the resurrection of Jesus Christ was a historical fact or not. He eventually concluded that it was, and became a Christian. After his degree, Sach worked as an apprentice for a year at the church of St Andrew the Great, Cambridge.\nSach then did a doctorate in neuroscience at the University of York.

Courrier International  was then sold to Vivendi, together with L'Express, then to Le Monde group, which had looked to buy it since its creation.  Rosselin was succeeded by Bernard Wouts, who joined via G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Occidentale. Wouts, a former executive of le Monde, had met with the founders in 1989 but declined their offer to join the then fledgling magazine.Today the paper is part of Le Monde group and edited by Philippe Thureau-Dangin, who joined in 1993. A number of original employees are still there, the most senior are Hidenobu Suzuki and Kazuhiko Yatabe, who worked on number zero in June 1988.For its twentieth anniversary, on the 9 September 2010, Courrier international unveiled a new logo and layout. The redesign was accompanied by a marketing campaign which included an image of two planes circling, without colliding with, the digitally shortened towers of the World Trade Center in New York. The implication being that if the towers had been smaller there would have been no collision. The image, which illustrated the magazine's new slogan \u00ab Learn to anticipate \u00bb (\u00ab Apprendre \u00e0 anticiper \u00bb), solicited numerous negative reactions in the United States.In 2020 the circulation of Courier International was of 168,766 copies.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was performed in Italian by Gigliola Cinquetti representing Italy. Like all previous Italian Eurovision entries, the song had also won that year's Sanremo Music Festival. Cinquetti was sixteen years old, making her the youngest Eurovision winner in history until 1986 when Belgium's Sandra Kim won the contest with \"J'aime la vie\" \u2013 initially claiming to be fifteen, it was later revealed that Kim was only thirteen. In 1990, the EBU made a new rule requiring contestants to be aged 16 or older before the contest; this age rule still operates.\nThe song was performed twelfth on the night, following Portugal's Ant\u00f3nio Calv\u00e1rio with \"Ora\u00e7\u00e3o\" and preceding Yugoslavia's Sabahudin Kurt with \"\u017divot je sklopio krug\". By the close of voting, it had received 49 points, placing it first in a field of 16.\n\"Non ho l'et\u00e0\" became a considerable commercial success for Cinquetti, in Italy, the rest of Europe, Scandinavia and other countries worldwide; she also recorded the song in English (\"This is my prayer\"), Spanish (\"No tengo edad\"), French (\"Je suis \u00e0 toi\"), German (\"Luna nel blu\"), and Japanese (\"Yumemiru omoi\", \u5922\u307f\u308b\u60f3\u3044). The song has since been recorded by a wide range of artists in other languages, for example, in Icelandic as \"Heyr m\u00edna b\u00e6n\" by Ell\u00fd Vilhj\u00e1lms. Lili Ivanova, a famous Bulgarian singer, and Hong Kong singer Rebecca Pan, covered the song in 1964. Polish-Belarusian singer Wies\u0142awa Drojecka covered the song in Polish (\"Nie wolno mi\"). Anneli Sari made a Finnish cover (\"Liian nuori rakkauteen\"). Sandra Reemer recorded the song in Dutch (\"Als jij maar wacht\").\nThe song was followed as contest winner in 1965 by France Gall singing \"Poup\u00e9e de cire, poup\u00e9e de son\" for Luxembourg. It was followed as Italian representative that year by Bobby Solo with \"Se piangi, se ridi\".\nCinquetti later returned to perform at the contest in 1974, when she finished second with \"S\u00ec\", behind ABBA's \"Waterloo\". In 1991, she co-hosted the contest in Rome alongside Toto Cutugno. In 2022, she performed the song as an interval act at the Eurovision final in Turin.\nCinquetti was proved not to be a UK 'one-hit-wonder' when an English recording of her 1974 Eurovision entry (titled \"Go\") reached #8 in the UK chart.", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "407_318", "question": "Which language was Come and See written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "800_29447", "text": "Stein's writing can be placed in three categories: \"hermetic\" works best illustrated by The Making of Americans: The Hersland Family; popularized writing such as The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas; and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years, of which Brewsie and Willie is a good example. Her works include novels, plays, stories, libretti, and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic, playful, repetitive, and humorous style. Typical quotes are: \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\"; \"Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cattle\"; about her childhood home in Oakland, \"There is no there there\"; and \"The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.\"A reader wrote to Stein in 1933 asking her to explain the rose quotation received a reply from Toklas as her secretary: \"The device rose is a rose is a rose is a rose means just that. Miss Stein is unfortunately too busy herself to be able to tell you herself, but trusts that you will eventually come to understand that each and every word that she writes means exactly what she says, for she says very exactly what she means, and really nothing more, but, of course, nothing less.\"These stream-of-consciousness experiments, rhythmical essays or \"portraits\", were designed to evoke \"the excitingness of pure being\" and can be seen as literature's answer to visual art styles and forms such as Cubism, plasticity, and collage. Many of the experimental works such as Tender Buttons have since been interpreted by critics as a feminist reworking of patriarchal language. These works were well received by avant-garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success. Despite Stein's work on \"automatic writing\" with William James, she did not see her work as automatic, but as an 'excess of consciousness'.Though Stein collected cubist paintings, especially those of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of C\u00e9zanne. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: \"the whole field of the canvas is important\". Rather than a figure/ground relationship, \"Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered as much as any other.\" It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: \"[T]he important thing... is that you must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality.\"Her use of repetition is ascribed to her search for descriptions of the \"bottom nature\" of her characters, such as in The Making of Americans where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as \"As I was saying\" and \"There will be now a history of her.\" Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with \"too much association\". Social judgment is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power to decide how to think and feel about the writing. Anxiety, fear, and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative. Stein's work was included in the second issue of 0 to 9 magazine, a journal which explored language and meaning-making during the 1960s avant garde movement.\nStein predominantly used the present progressive tense, creating a continuous presence in her work, which Grahn argues is a consequence of the previous principles, especially commonality and centeredness. Grahn describes \"play\" as the granting of autonomy and agency to the readers or audience: \"rather than the emotional manipulation that is a characteristic of linear writing, Stein uses play.\" In addition, Stein's work is funny, and multilayered, allowing a variety of interpretations and engagements. Lastly, Grahn argues that one must \"insterstand... engage with the work, to mix with it in an active engagement, rather than 'figuring it out.' Figure it in.\" In 1932, using an accessible style to appeal to a wider audience, she wrote The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas; the book would become her first best-seller. Despite the title, it was actually Stein's autobiography. The style was quite similar to that of The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook, which was written by Toklas. Many critics speculated that Toklas actually had written The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, despite Toklas repeatedly denying authorship.Several of Stein's writings have been set to music by composers, including Virgil Thomson's operas Four Saints in Three Acts and The Mother of Us All, and James Tenney's setting of Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose as a canon dedicated to Philip Corner, beginning with \"a\" on an upbeat and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words, e.g. \"a/rose is a rose/is a rose is/a rose is a/rose.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "407_325", "question": "Which language was Sahara written in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "112_63188", "text": "Being a largely unlisted company Sahara India Parivar's activities have come under criticism largely because of legal issues it is facing.On 26 February 2014, the Supreme Court of India had issues warrants to summon Subrata Roy, Managing Worker, chairman and founder of Sahara India Pariwar, on a litigation on the Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures issued by the two companies of Sahara India Pariwar to which Securities and Exchange Board of India had claimed its jurisdiction and objected on why Sahara has not taken permission from it. Sahara has claimed that the said bonds are hybrid product, thus does not come under the jurisdiction of SEBI, instead is governed by Registrar of Companies (ROC) under Ministry of Corporate Affairs, from which the two companies of Sahara has already taken permission and submitted the red herring prospectus with ROC before issuing the bonds.\nSEBI in return ordered Sahara's two companies to stop issuing the said bonds and return money to investors. Sahara contested the case in various courts which eventually came to Supreme Court of India. On 14 June 2012, (during the final hearing of the case), the group had provided details of its financials up to 30 April 2012. While the court reserved its order, Sahara claims that it has already paid to 95% of the investors and discharged its OFCD liability to the tune of \u20b923,500 crore (US$2.9 billion) and only around \u20b92,260 crore (US$280 million) are left against which Sahara has already deposited more than \u20b912,000 crore (US$1.5 billion) which has with interest swelled to \u20b916,000 crore (US$2.0 billion). By 31 August 2012 the date of Supreme Court order, the group repaid majority of its OFCD investors between May the last date of hearing and by 30 August 2012 the final order. Since these repayments have not been taken into consideration, Sahara maintains that any money paid now will obviously mean a double payment towards one liability.\nIt is also been reported that Sahara has paid \u20b9725.9 crore (US$91 million) as TDS (tax deducted at source) to the Income Tax Departments on the interest which along with investment was repaid to 95 percent of the investors, between 2009\u201310 and 2012\u201313. The income tax authorities had found that the beneficiary investors were existent and accordingly confirmed the repayments made in those particular years. One of Sahara's arguments in the apex court revolves around the fact that if one government body has found investors, why can't the other.The case itself comprises big numbers such as collection of over \u20b924,000 crore (US$3.0 billion) from three crore individuals, while once in 2013 Sahara sent 127 trucks containing 31,669 cartons full of over three crore application forms and two crore redemption vouchers to SEBI office. Apparently, this had resulted into a huge traffic jam on outskirts of Mumbai, where the regulator is headquartered. SEBI on the other hand because the trucks reached after office hours SEBI rejected the second batch of files, which as per Sahara contained 25% of the investor information.Furthermore, the market regulator SEBI advertised four times in more than 144 newspapers to ask the investors of Sahara to refund the money. And since August 2012 Sebi has only refunded \u20b964 crore (US$8.0 million) to the investors while it has \u20b916,000 crore (US$2.0 billion) from Sahara. In October 2014, a shocking revelation was made when only around 4,600 investors in two Sahara group companies had come forward to claim refunds from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which had asked those who had purchased bonds issued by the entities to claim their money. This gave a valid point to Sahara's argument before courts that it had repaid most of the investors who had come forward to claim the investment which they had made in bonds issued by two group companies.He was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on 26 March 2014 on the condition that he would deposit the huge bail amount of \u20b910,000 crore (US$1.3 billion). Subrata was eventually taken into judicial custody and sent to Tihar jail, along with two other Sahara directors, on 4 March 2014 for failing to deposit \u20b910,000 crore (US$1.3 billion) with SEBI. In Tihar jail, Subrata unsuccessfully tried to sell some of his hotel properties to raise \u20b910,000 crore (US$1.3 billion) for his bail bond. He remained in Tihar jail for more than two years, and was released on parole in May 2016 to attend the last rites of his deceased mother.On 1 July 2018, the group revealed that majority of \u20b920,000 crore (US$2.5 billion) of Sahara's money (including the interest) which is with SEBI will be refunded back to Sahara India as the group had already made majority of the payments to its investors. The group also stated that SEBI will be directed to start the verification of the documents of Sahara's investors, which are already provided to them by Sahara India Pariwar. Despite the double payment for single liability, Sahara India has been continuously depositing money of around \u20b920,000 crore (including interest earned) in Sahara-Sebi account.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The system's original creator, Franz Josef Och, has criticized the effectiveness of rule-based algorithms in favor of statistical approaches. Original versions of Google Translate were based on a method called statistical machine translation, and more specifically, on research by Och who won the DARPA contest for speed machine translation in 2003. Och was the head of Google's machine translation group until leaving to join Human Longevity, Inc. in July 2014.Google Translate does not directly translate from one language to another (L1 \u2192 L2). Instead, it often translates first to English and then to the target language (L1 \u2192 EN \u2192 L2). However, because English, like all human languages, is ambiguous and depends on context, this can cause translation errors. For example, translating vous from French to Russian gives vous \u2192 you \u2192 \u0442\u044b OR B\u044b/\u0432\u044b. If Google were using an unambiguous, artificial language as the intermediary, it would be vous \u2192 you \u2192 B\u044b/\u0432\u044b OR tu \u2192 thou \u2192 \u0442\u044b. Such a suffixing of words disambiguates their different meanings. Hence, publishing in English, using unambiguous words, providing context, using expressions such as \"you all\" may or may not make a better one-step translation depending on the target language.\nThe following languages do not have a direct Google translation to or from English. These languages are translated through the indicated intermediate language (which in most cases is closely related to the desired language but more widely spoken) in addition to through English:\nBelarusian (be \u2194 ru \u2194 en \u2194 other);\nCatalan (ca \u2194 es \u2194 en \u2194 other);\nGalician (gl \u2194 pt \u2194 en \u2194 other);\nHaitian Creole (ht \u2194 fr \u2194 en \u2194 other);\nKorean (ko \u2194 ja \u2194 en \u2194 other);\nSlovak (sk \u2194 cs \u2194 en \u2194 other);\nUkrainian (uk \u2194 ru \u2194 en \u2194 other);\nUrdu (ur \u2194 hi \u2194 en \u2194 other).According to Och, a solid base for developing a usable statistical machine translation system for a new pair of languages from scratch would consist of a bilingual text corpus (or parallel collection) of more than 150-200 million words, and two monolingual corpora each of more than a billion words. Statistical models from these data are then used to translate between those languages.\nTo acquire this huge amount of linguistic data, Google used United Nations and European Parliament documents and transcripts. The UN typically publishes documents in all six official UN languages, which has produced a very large 6-language corpus.\nGoogle representatives have been involved with domestic conferences in Japan where it has solicited bilingual data from researchers.When Google Translate generates a translation proposal, it looks for patterns in hundreds of millions of documents to help decide on the best translation. By detecting patterns in documents that have already been translated by human translators, Google Translate makes informed guesses (AI) as to what an appropriate translation should be.Before October 2007, for languages other than Arabic, Chinese and Russian, Google Translate was based on SYSTRAN, a software engine which is still used by several other online translation services such as Babel Fish (now defunct). From October 2007, Google Translate used proprietary, in-house technology based on statistical machine translation instead, before transitioning to neural machine translation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the first decade after the independence of Belgium, the neglect of the Dutch language and culture gradually caused increasingly greater dissatisfaction in the Flemish community. In 1856, the \"Grievances Commission\" was established to investigate the problems of the Flemings. It was devoted to making the administration, military, educational system and judicial system bilingual, but was politically ignored. Another group to decry the problems of the Flemings was \"Vlamingen Vooruit\" (\"Flemings Forward\"), founded in 1858 in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode.  Members included Charles Buls, mayor of Brussels, and L\u00e9on Vanderkindere, mayor of Uccle.  Although Brussels was 57% Dutch-speaking in 1880, Flemish primary schools were prohibited until 1883. In 1884, the municipal government decided to allow birth, death, and marriage certificates to be written in Dutch.  However, only a tenth of the population made use of these opportunities, suggesting that in the minds of Brussels' inhabitants, French was the normal way of conducting these matters. In 1889, Dutch was once again allowed in courtrooms, but only for use in oral testimony.In the late 19th century, the Flemish movement gained even more strength and demanded Belgium be made bilingual. This proposal was rejected by French speakers, who feared a \"Flemishization\" of Wallonia as well as the prospect of having to learn Dutch in order to obtain a job in the civil service. The Flemings adapted their goals to the realities of the situation and devoted themselves to a monolingual Flanders, which Brussels was still socially a part of.  The Flemings hoped to limit the spread of French in Flanders by restricting the areas in which French was an official language. In 1873 in the Sint-Jans-Molenbeek district of Brussels, Flemish labourer Jozef Schoep refused to accept a French-language birth certificate. He was ordered to pay a fine of 50 francs. His case generated considerable controversy and shortly thereafter the Coremans Law was introduced, which allowed Dutch to be used by Dutch speakers in court.In general, the Flemish movement in Brussels did not garner much support for its plans regarding the use of Dutch. Each attempt to promote Dutch and limit the expansion of French influence as a symbol of social status was seen as a means to stifle social mobility rather than as a protective measure as it was seen in the rest of Flanders.  Whereas in other Flemish cities such as Ghent in which the Flemish labourers were dominated by a French-speaking upper class, in Brussels it was not as easy to make such a distinction because so many Walloons made up a large portion of the working class. The linguistic heterogeneity, combined with the fact that most of the workers' upper class spoke French, meant that the class struggle for most workers in Brussels was not seen as a language struggle as well. Ever since the start of the 20th century, the workers' movement in Brussels defended bilingualism, so as to have a means of emancipation for the local working class. This, along with the educational system, facilitated the Francization of thousands of Brussels residents.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Elyssa Garnder from USA Today gave the album a mixed review, stating that \"Rowland traverses the gamut of predictable romantic scenarios prettily enough... alas, Here I Am proves a lot more cautious than that dare suggests.\" Jon Caramanica from The New York Times called the album both smart and surprising. \"Here I Am is something much more confident and more surprising [than expected]. It's a chewy and moody R&B album on which Ms. Rowland sounds assured and vital. Or, at minimum, is made to sound that way... Her vocals are stacked thick and placed loud in the mix, but while they're noticeable, they're not particularly notable apart from their arrangements.\"Despite finding some of its material unoriginal, Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe commented that \"Rowland makes up for her limited range with expressiveness throughout,\" while noting that the songs are centered around \"self-affirmation and confidence.\" He ended his review by stating that the album's closing track \"Down for Whatever\" had a \"pounding groove\" which should have been the sentiment for the rest of the album. Allison Stewart from The Washington Post commented that Here I Am would not establish a personality for Rowland, but it did not matter as she was in a place in her career where she did not need one. Described as a \"perfectly likeable club-centric R&B\" offering, Stewart said Rowland makes the most of the \"killer beats and a flat affect\" trends in the industry. Comments echoed by Michaelangelo Matos from the Los Angeles Times' whose scathing review criticised the \"bland material,\" particularly noting \"secondhand beats\" and awkward lyrics. Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo also called the album mediocre. Cataldo said \"the skimpy roster [of rappers] makes Here I Am sound distressingly bare, and depressingly short on surprises and diversion. Rowland makes up for this by pushing the sex angle, but this pose never seems entirely natural.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 406, Tufa Rutan attacked Northern Liang but after Juqu Mengxun refused to engage him, withdrew, and he made a tribute of 3,000 horses and 30,000 cattle to Yao Xing, greatly touching Yao Xing and making him believing in Tufa Rutan's loyalty, and so he commissioned Tufa Rutan with governorship of Liang Province (\u6dbc\u5dde, at that time only Guzang and its surroundings), giving him Guzang.  Later that year, Tufa Rutan moved his capital from Ledu to Guzang.  He also entered into an alliance with Western Li\u00e1ng's duke Li Gao, aimed against Northern Liang.\nWhile Tufa Rutan was nominally a Later Qin vassal, he did not actually wish to serve Yao Xing long, and in 407 he proposed to Qifu Chipan (who had then temporarily taken over his father Qifu Gangui's troops, since Qifu Gangui was detained at the Later Qin capital Chang'an) an alliance, but Qifu Chipan executed his messengers and delivered their heads to Yao Xing.  Still, at this time, Southern Liang's power was at its apex.\nAt this time, though, a major defeat would cause Southern Liang's strength to begin to wane.  In winter 407, the Later Qin rebel Liu Bobo, who had earlier that year broken from Later Qin and established Xia, requested to marry Tufa Rutan's daughter.  Tufa Rutan refused, and in anger Liu Bobo launched a punitive raid against Southern Liang but then retreated.  Tufa Rutan gave chase and, believing that he greatly outpowered Liu Bobo, was careless in his military actions.  Liu Bobo led him into a canyon and then blocked the exit with ice and wagons, and then ambushed him\u2014and the defeat was such that it was said that 60% to 70% of Southern Liang's famed officials and generals died in the battle.  Tufa Rutan barely escaped capture.  In fear, Tufa Rutan ordered that all of the people within 150 kilometers of Guzang be moved into the capital, which immediately led to mass panic and a rebellion by the Xiongnu chief Cheng Qi'er (\u6210\u4e03\u5152).  While Cheng's rebellion was defeated, Tufa Rutan's domain had been greatly wounded.\nIn light of Tufa Rutan's defeat, Yao Xing plotted his destruction, despite the advice of Wei Zong (\u97cb\u5b97), an official of his who had personal knowledge of Tufa Rutan's ability, against such action.  In 408, he commissioned his son Yao Bi (\u59da\u5f3c) the Duke of Guangping to lead a large force with generals Lian Cheng (\u6582\u6210) and Qifu Gangui to make a surprise attack on Southern Liang\u2014tricking Tufa Rutan into initially not resisting by informing him that the army was intended to be part of a pincer movement against Xia.  Only when the Later Qin forces reached Guzang's vicinity did Tufa Rutan realize what the purpose of the campaign was, and he defended the city against Yao Bi.  When a rebellion inside the city itself, led by Wang Zhong (\u738b\u937e), threatened to cause the city to fall, Tufa Rutan buried some 5,000 people alive, and he then defeated Yao Bi.  When Yao Xing sent Yao Xian (\u59da\u986f) the Duke of Changshan to aid Yao Bi, Tufa Rutan defeated him as well, and Yao Xian, in fear, blamed Lian for the entire campaign and apologized to Tufa Rutan, and then withdrew with Yao Bi.  Tufa Rutan also sent a messenger to Chang'an to request forgiveness.\nIn winter 408, Tufa Rutan again declared independence, and claimed the title of Prince of Liang, in light of Later Qin's defeats at his own hands and at the hands of Liu Bobo.  He created his wife Lady Zhejue princess, and his son Tufa Hutai (\u79bf\u9aee\u864e\u53f0) crown prince.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The name is currently popular among the people of Generations X and Generation Y. The name itself peaked in popularity at #3, in 1975.Heather, though a name found primarily in English speaking countries, has other variants simply because of its definition as a flowering plant. However its foreign names often closely resemble other words with meanings so is difficult to distinguish a given variant's origin as arising from the flower, or from that of another word. For example, the name Heidi in German resembles Heidekraut, which is the German word for the Heather shrubs, though the name Heidi is usually thought to mean \"of noble birth\" (a diminutive of the name Adelheid).  The 1988 dark comedy film, Heathers, satirized the name by associating it with \"in-crowd\" cliques of teen-age high school girls.\nThe name Erica actually has two meanings, one of which is related to the Heather plant whose Latin name is Ericaceae. Its other meaning of \"ruler\" is similar to that of the German meaning of Heidi. This leaves the impression that the shrub name and the meaning of \"a noble\" or \"ruler\" are similar, or it is a large coincidence.", "hasanswer": false}]}

My stories, your stories, our stories are held in the object,\u201d says Clark.Clark is perhaps best known for artwork that honors contemporary craftspeople, like hairdressers, and notable African American figures. She has studied with craftspeople in places like Australia, Brazil, China, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, and Indonesia, where she learned about their mediums, tools, technique, and cultural associations. In her work, craft and community and intertwined; many of her projects involve participation and promote collaboration across racial, gender, and socioeconomic lines.\nOne of Clark's artist statements describes her work as follows: I use craft and materials to investigate identity. Simple objects become cultural interfaces. Through them I navigate accord and discord. When trying to unravel complex issues, I am instinctively drawn to things that connect to my personal narrative as a point of departure: a comb or a strand of hair. Charged with agency, simple objects nave the mysterious ability to reflect or absorb us. I find my image, my personal story, in an object. But it is also the object's ability to act as a rhizome, the multiple ways in which it can be discovered or read by a wide audience that draws me in. To sustain my practice, I milk the object, its potential, its image, and its materiality. I manipulate the object in a formal manner to engage the viewer in conversation about collective meaning. If we unravel a cloth together, what do we learn in the process? What is the connection between combs, hair, and textiles? Can a strand of hair tell a life story or a whole cultural history? I trust that my stories, your stories, our stories are held in the object. In this way, the everyday \"thing\" becomes a lens through which we may better see one another.

At the time, Mace was a 40-year-old concert pianist who was also head of the classical music department at Mercury Records. During this time, Bowie terminated his contract with Pitt and met his future manager Tony Defries, who assisted Bowie in the termination. Recording moved to Trident Studios in London on 21 April and continued there for the rest of April until mid-May. On 4 May, the band recorded \"Running Gun Blues\" and \"Saviour Machine\", the latter of which was originally the working title for the title track, before Bowie reworked the song into a different melody to form the final version of \"Saviour Machine\". Recording and mixing was moved back to Advision on 12 May and completed ten days later. Bowie recorded his vocal for the title track on the final day.As Bowie was preoccupied with his new wife Angie at the time, as well as his managerial issues, the music was largely arranged by Ronson and Visconti. Ronson used the sessions to learn about many production and arrangement techniques from Visconti. Although Bowie is officially credited as the composer of all music on The Man Who Sold the World, author Peter Doggett quoted Visconti as saying that \"the songs were written by all four of us. We'd jam in a basement, and Bowie would just say whether he liked them or not.\" In Doggett's narrative, \"The band (sometimes with Bowie contributing guitar, sometimes not) would record an instrumental track, which might or might not be based upon an original Bowie idea. Then, at the last possible moment, Bowie would reluctantly uncurl himself from the sofa on which he was lounging with his wife, and dash off a set of lyrics.\" Conversely, Bowie was quoted in a 1998 interview as saying, \"I really did object to the impression that I did not write the songs on The Man Who Sold the World. You only have to check out the chord changes. No-one writes chord changes like that.\" \"The Width of a Circle\" and \"The Supermen\", for example, were already in existence before the sessions began.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The issue was resolved when Noel bought U2's spot in cash without the band's knowledge; this was possible due to the fact that the studios gave preference to cash payments over credit, which U2 had been booked with.

In some early performances Robert Plant introduced the song as \"Killing Floor\"; an early UK pressing of Led Zeppelin II showed the title as \"Killing Floor\" and was credited to Chester Burnett (Howlin' Wolf's real name). For the second and third North American tours the song evolved into \"The Lemon Song\", with Plant often improvising lyrics onstage (the opening lyrics to both songs are identical).\nOther lyrics, notably \"squeeze (my lemon) till the juice runs down my leg,\"  can be traced to Robert Johnson's \"Travelling Riverside Blues\".

The song also references Albert King's \"Cross-Cut Saw\"\nIn December 1972, Arc Music, owner of the publishing rights to Howlin' Wolf's songs, sued Led Zeppelin for copyright infringement on \"The Lemon Song\".

The first publication was a book, Two Treatises of the Lord His Holie Supper. In 1591 the first Cambridge Bible was printed by John Legate and in 1629 Cambridge folio edition of the King James Bible was printed by Thomas and John Buck.In July 1697, the Duke of Somerset made a loan of \u00a3200 to the university \"towards the printing house and press\" and James Halman, Registrary of the university, lent \u00a3100 for the same purpose.A new home for the press, The Pitt Building, on Trumpington Street in the centre of Cambridge was completed in 1833, which was designed by Edward Blore. It became a listed building in 1950.In the early 1800s, the press pioneers the development of stereotype printing, allowing successive printings from one setting. The press began using steam-powered machine presses by the 1850s. It was in this period that the press turned down what later became the Oxford English Dictionary \u2013 a proposal for which was brought to Cambridge by James Murray before he turned to Oxford.The press journals publishing programme began in 1893 with the Journal of Physiology and then the Journal of Hygiene and Biometrika. By 1910 the press had become a well-established journal publisher with a successful list which includes its first humanities title, Modern Language Review. 1956 saw the first issue of the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.\nThe press has published 170+ Nobel Prize winners, the first in 1895.\nIn 1913, the Monotype system of hot-metal mechanised typesetting was introduced at the press.\nIn 1949, the press opened its first international branch in New York.The press moved to its current site in Cambridge in 1963. The mid-century modern building, University Printing House, was constructed in 1961\u20131963. The building was designed by Beard, Bennett, Wilkins and Partners.In 1975, the press launched its English language teaching publishing business.In 1981, the press moved to a new site on Shaftsbury Road. The Edinburgh Building was purpose-built with an adjoining warehouse to accommodate the press's expansion. It was built in 1979\u201380 by International Design and Construction. This site was sold to Cambridge Assessment in 2015 for the construction of the Triangle Building.In 1989, the press acquired the long-established Bible and prayer-book publisher Eyre & Spottiswoode, which gave the press the ancient and unique title of The Queen's Printer.In 1992, the press opened a bookshop at 1 Trinity Street, Cambridge, which is the oldest-known bookshop site in Britain as books have been sold there since 1581. In 2008 the shop expanded into 27 Market Hill where its specialist Education and English Language Teaching shop opened the following year.

Several NES games feature the name \"NESTER\" as one of the pre-set names on high-score lists, or a default character name such as in To the Earth.  The original NES release of Dragon Warrior references both Howard and Nester through character dialog, however this was removed in the later Game Boy Color version.  He is mentioned in one line of dialogue in the game StarTropics. A DLC microgame in WarioWare D.I.Y. created by Nintendo Power called Funky Boxing (a loose reference to Nester's Funky Bowling) does not have any apparent references to the character, but if the game is opened in the editor, the player's boxer is named \"NESTER\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Due to their shared interests in the occult and spirituality, they immediately took a liking to each other. Soon Eileen was in the circle that formed around Sheena Govan.\nPeter Caddy's marriage was already in trouble. Their friend Dorothy Maclean later recalled that Sheena had declared that she was no longer her husband's \"other half\", and that soon Peter would meet his \"true partner\".Eileen and Peter fell in love and in 1953 after returning to England, she asked Combe for a divorce in a letter to him in Iraq, where he was still posted. Combe immediately forbade her from seeing their five children. It was then that a traumatized Eileen visited a private sanctuary at Glastonbury with Peter, where she first claimed to have heard while meditating, the \"voice of God\", which said: \"Be still and know that I am God.\" Initially she took it as a sign of a nervous breakdown, but in time she began to \"love the voice as an instrument from the God within us all\". Her subsequent instructions from the \"voice\" directed her to take on Sheena as her spiritual teacher. Sheena moved away to the Isle of Mull, Scotland, having divorced Peter Caddy. By the autumn of 1956, Peter and Eileen came over to join her nascent group of followers there, along with the two children they already had together. Following a divorce, Eileen married Peter Caddy in 1957, and they had one more son in 1968.\nMeanwhile, Sheena's group was fast gaining popularity, and was dubbed the 'Nameless Ones' by the local media, which also called her \"the woman Messiah\". Subsequently, from 1957, Peter and Eileen Caddy co-managed a run-down hotel in Scotland, the Cluny Hill Hotel in Forres, Moray, which they reportedly resurrected and turned into a four star hotel following practical guidance given by the \"voice\". Early in 1962, the couple along with most of the staff were sent by the management to resurrect another of their properties, the Trossachs Hotel, at Perthshire, but when they pleaded to be shifted back to Forres closer to their \"mission\", they were fired.Following the resulting period of unemployment, on 17 November 1962 Eileen, her husband Peter, the children and their colleague Dorothy Maclean, moved to a holiday caravan in a trailer park, a few miles from Forres and a mile from the village of Findhorn. There they began practising organic gardening as a means of supplementing their family's food supply. The garden flourished to such a remarkable extent with the help of what they claimed were plant spirit and devas that it eventually attracted national attention, and was featured in a 1965 BBC radio programme. Its supporters included Sir George Trevelyan and Lady Eve Balfour of the Soil Association.\n\nBeginning in 1965 a community, eventually known as the Findhorn Foundation, began to form around the work and spiritual practices of Eileen and Peter Caddy and Dorothy Maclean. The community was featured in several television documentaries by the BBC, starting in 1969, when BBC TV programme Man Alive came to Findhorn, resulting in greatly increased public awareness. Soon the place became a favorite haunt for thousands of New Agers from around the world and the community bought the Cluny Hill Hotel in 1975 and turned it into a college, which stands seven miles from the Findhorn Bay Area caravan park, which was bought in 1983 More recently it was profiled by the Channel 4 documentary series, The Haven, in 2004.\nIn 1971 Eileen, as \"guided\" by her inner voice, stopped receiving guidance for the community and from then on remained as an inspiring figure within the community. Dorothy Maclean moved to the United States in 1973, while Peter left Findhorn in 1978 after falling for a young female community member; he married twice in the following years, even started a Findhorn-style community in California, but eventually died in a car crash in 1994. Meanwhile, all through the 1980s, Eileen travelled across the world speaking at spiritual gathers, and also writing several books, including her \"compendium of daily guidance\", \"Opening Doors Within\", which went on to be translated in 30 languages. Her works include God Spoke to Me, a volume of inspirational messages published in various formats from 1966 onwards, and an autobiography titled Flight into Freedom and Beyond. Finally in 1996 at the age of 76, Eileen stopped giving workshops, as her inner voice \"suggested\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

As the eldest son of Ferdinand I, he became crown prince upon the death of his grand-uncle, King Carol I, in 1914. He was the first of the Hohenzollern kings of Romania to be born in the country, as both of his predecessors had been born in Germany and came to Romania only as adults. As such, he was the first member of the Romanian branch of the Hohenzollerns who spoke Romanian as his first language and was also the first member of his royal family to be raised in the Orthodox faith.Carol's life and reign were surrounded by controversy and accusations of lack of duty, due to his desertion from the army during World War I. Another controversy was his marriage to Zizi Lambrino, which resulted in two attempts by Carol to give up the rights of succession to the royal crown of Romania, both of which were refused by his father King Ferdinand.After the dissolution of his marriage, he met Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark, daughter of King Constantine I of Greece, married her in March of 1921, and had a child in the same year, that being King Michael of Romania. But due to Carol's continued affairs with Elena Lupescu he was obliged to renounce his succession rights in 1925 and leave the country. His name was subsequently removed from the royal house of Romania by King Ferdinand I. After his removal from the Royal House, Carol moved to France with Lupescu under the name Carol Caraiman. Michael, aged 5, inherited the throne on the death of King Ferdinand in 1927. Princess Helen eventually divorced Carol in 1928.\nIn the political crisis created by the deaths of Ferdinand I and Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu, and the ineffective regency of Prince Nicholas of Romania, Miron Cristea, and Gheorghe Buzdugan, Carol was allowed to return to Romania in 1930, and his name was restored by the royal house of Romania, dethroning his own son. The beginning of Carol\u2019s reign was marked by the negative economic effects of the Great Depression. Carol II weakened the parliament of Romania often appointing minority factions of historical parties to the government and attempting to form nationally concentrated governments, such as the Iorga-Argetoianu government. He also allowed for the formation of a corrupt parliament chamber around him, under the patronage of Elena Lupescu. A political crisis followed the December 1937 elections, where no party achieved an absolute majority and a coalition could not be formed because of disagreements between the National Liberal Party and the National Peasants Party and Iron Guard whom they would have needed to form a Coalition Government. Following this crisis Carol established a royal dictatorship in 1938 by removing the 1923 constitution, abolishing all political parties, and forming a new single party, the National Renaissance Front, which consisted mostly of former members of the National Peasants Party and National Christian Party who had been patronized by the king. The National Renaissance Front was the last of several attempts to counter the popularity of the fascist Iron Guard.\nFollowing the start of World War II, Carol II reaffirmed the Polish\u2013Romanian alliance; the military assistance was however declined by Poland, who wished to follow the Romanian Bridgehead plan that required a neutral Romania. Following the fall of Poland and the involvement of the USSR, Carol II maintained a neutrality policy. After the fall of France, Carol II's policy changed towards re-alignment with Nazi Germany in hopes of gaining a German guarantee. He was however not aware of the secret clauses of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact between Germany and the Soviet Union that would see Romania lose significant parts of its territory. The year 1940 marked the fragmentation of Greater Romania by the seceding of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the USSR, Northern Transylvania to Hungary and Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria. Although after which, a German guarantee was finally achieved, the situation had a disastrous effect on the reputation of Carol II. The reorientation of Romania's foreign policy towards Nazi Germany, however, would not prevent his regime from collapsing and he would be forced to abdicate by General Ion Antonescu, the newly appointed and Nazi-backed prime minister, and was succeeded by his son Michael. After his abdication, Carol was permitted to leave the country with a special train loaded with his personal fortunes which he had acquired during his time as King and an attempt on his life was made by the Iron Guard, who had  fired on the train in hope of killing the former king. After World War II, Carol II wanted to return to the helm of the country and dethrone his son again but was stopped by the Western Allies. For the rest of his life, he traveled the world finally marrying Elena Lupescu while living in Brazil in 1947. After settling in the Portuguese Riviera, Carol II at the age of 59 died peacefully in exile and his son Michael I, refused to attend his funeral out of disgust for the treatment of his mother, Princess Helen by his father.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film was written by Dreyer and Christen Jul based on elements from J. Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 collection of supernatural stories In a Glass Darkly. Vampyr was funded by Nicolas de Gunzburg who starred in the film under the name of Julian West among a mostly non-professional cast. Gunzburg plays the role of Allan Gray, a student of the occult who enters the village of Courtempierre, which is under the curse of a vampire.\nVampyr was challenging for Dreyer to make as it was his first sound film and was required to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with  title cards like a silent film. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The soundtrack was created in Berlin where the characters\u2019 voices, sound effects, and score were recorded.\nVampyr had a delayed release in Germany and opened to a generally negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut. The film was long considered a low point in Dreyer's career, but modern critical reception to the film has become much more favorable with critics praising the film's disorienting visual effects and atmosphere.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A battle took place in which the Portuguese were defeated and their leader, the Viceroy's son Balthazar, killed the Spanish officer Andrea before being taken captive by the Spanish. Andrea's ghost and the personification Revenge itself are present onstage throughout the entirety of the play and serve as chorus. At the end of each act, Andrea bemoans the series of injustices that have taken place and then Revenge reassures him that those deserving will get their comeuppance. The Ghost of Andrea and Revenge open the play in Act 1 and close the play in Act 5 with descriptions of the Classical underworld. There is also a subplot concerning the enmity of two Portuguese noblemen, one of whom attempts to convince the Viceroy that his rival has murdered the missing Balthazar.\nThe King's nephew Lorenzo and Andrea's best friend Horatio dispute over who captured Balthazar. Though it is made clear early on that Horatio defeated Balthazar and Lorenzo has essentially cheated his way into taking partial credit, the King leaves Balthazar in Lorenzo's charge and splits the spoils of the victory between the two. Horatio comforts Lorenzo's sister, Bel-imperia, who was in love with Andrea against her family's wishes. Despite her former feelings for Andrea, Bel-imperia soon falls for Horatio. She confesses that her love for Horatio is motivated partially by her desire for revenge: Bel-imperia intends to torment Balthazar, who killed her former lover Andrea.\nMeanwhile, Balthazar is falling in love with Bel-imperia. The Spanish king decides that a marriage between Balthazar and Bel-imperia would be an excellent way to repair the peace with Portugal. Horatio's father, the Marshal Hieronimo, stages an entertainment for the Portuguese ambassador. Lorenzo, suspecting that Bel-imperia has found a new lover, bribes her servant Pedringano and discovers that Horatio is the man. He persuades Balthazar to help him murder Horatio during an assignation with Bel-imperia. Hieronimo and his wife Isabella find the body of their son hanged and stabbed, and Isabella is driven mad. (Revisions made to the original play supplement the scene with Hieronimo briefly losing his wits as well.)\nLorenzo locks Bel-imperia away, but she succeeds in sending Hieronimo a letter, written in her own blood, informing him that Lorenzo and Balthazar were Horatio's murderers. Hieronimo's questions and attempts to see Bel-imperia convince Lorenzo that he knows something. Afraid that Balthazar's servant Serberine has revealed the truth, Lorenzo convinces Pedringano to murder Serberine, then arranges for Pedringano's arrest in the hopes of silencing him too. Hieronimo, appointed judge, sentences Pedringano to death. Pedringano expects Lorenzo to procure his pardon, and Lorenzo, having written a fake letter of pardon, lets him believe this right up until the hangman drops Pedringano to his death.\nLorenzo manages to prevent Hieronimo from seeking justice by convincing the King that Horatio is alive and well. Furthermore, Lorenzo does not allow Hieronimo to see the King, claiming that he is too busy. This, combined with his wife Isabella's suicide, pushes Hieronimo past his limit. He rants incoherently and digs at the ground with his dagger. Lorenzo goes on to tell his uncle, the King, that Hieronimo's odd behaviour is due to his inability to deal with his son Horatio's newfound wealth (Balthazar's ransom from the Portuguese Viceroy), and he has gone mad with jealousy. Regaining his senses, Hieronimo, along with Bel-imperia, feigns reconciliation with the murderers, and asks them to join him in putting on a play, Soliman and Perseda, to entertain the court.\nWhen the play is performed, Hieronimo uses real daggers instead of prop daggers, so that Lorenzo and Balthazar are stabbed to death in front of the King, Viceroy, and Duke (Lorenzo and Bel-imperia's father). He cast the play in such a way that both himself and Bel-imperia could exact their own revenge by actually killing the murderers. Bel-imperia chooses to stab herself during the play too, although this was not Hieronimo's intention for her.\nHieronimo tells everyone of the motive behind the murders, bites out his own tongue to prevent himself from talking under torture, and kills the Duke of Castille and then himself. Andrea and Revenge are satisfied, and promise to deliver suitable eternal punishments to the guilty parties.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Their grammatical forms and meanings have been reconstructed by modern linguists, based on similarities found across all Indo-European languages.

Most of them had word stems ending in a consonant (called athematic stems) and exhibited a complex pattern of accent shifts and/or vowel changes (ablaut) among the different cases.\nTwo declensions ended in a vowel (*-o/e-) and are called thematic; they were more regular and became more common during the history of PIE and its older daughter languages.\nPIE very frequently derived nominals from verbs.

When text is well-structured, written using formal language, with simple sentences, relating to formal topics for which training data is ample, it often produces conversions similar to human translations between English and a number of high-resource languages. Accuracy decreases for those languages when fewer of those conditions apply, for example when sentence length increases or the text uses familiar or literary language. For many other languages vis-\u00e0-vis English, it can produce the gist of text in those formal circumstances. Human evaluation from English to all 102 languages shows that the main idea of a text is conveyed more than 50% of the time for 35 languages. For 67 languages, a minimally comprehensible result is not achieved 50% of the time or greater. A few studies have evaluated Chinese, French, German, and Spanish to English, but no systematic human evaluation has been conducted from most Google Translate languages to English. Speculative language-to-language scores extrapolated from English-to-other measurements indicate that Google Translate will produce translation results that convey the gist of a text from one language to another more than half the time in about 1% of language pairs, where neither language is English. Research conducted in 2011 showed that Google Translate got a slightly higher score than the UCLA minimum score for the English Proficiency Exam. Due to its identical choice of words without considering the flexibility of choosing alternative words or expressions, it produces a relatively similar translation to human translation from the perspective of formality, referential cohesion, and conceptual cohesion. Moreover, a number of languages are translated into a sentence structure and sentence length similar to a human translation. Furthermore, Google carried out a test that required native speakers of each language to rate the translation on a scale between 0 and 6, and Google Translate scored 5.43 on average.When used as a dictionary to translate single words, Google Translate is highly inaccurate because it must guess between polysemic words. Among the top 100 words in the English language, which make up more than 50% of all written English, the average word has more than 15 senses, which makes the odds against a correct translation about 15 to 1 if each sense maps to a different word in the target language. Most common English words have at least two senses, which produces 50/50 odds in the likely case that the target language uses different words for those different senses. The odds are similar from other languages to English. Google Translate makes statistical guesses that raise the likelihood of producing the most frequent sense of a word, with the consequence that an accurate translation will be unobtainable in cases that do not match the majority or plurality corpus occurrence. The accuracy of single-word predictions has not been measured for any language. Because almost all non-English language pairs pivot through English, the odds against obtaining accurate single-word translations from one non-English language to another can be estimated by multiplying the number of senses in the source language with the number of senses each of those terms have in English. When Google Translate does not have a word in its vocabulary, it makes up a result as part of its algorithm.Google Translate's inaccuracy can be illustrated by translating from one language to another then back to the original language. This will often result in nonsensical constructions, rather than recovering the original text.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was a volume of conventional, \"unadventurous\" poetry centering on themes such as love, beauty, and her husband.In 1926 they published her second book, Graven Images, with Houghton Mifflin in Boston. This was the only time they used another publisher. Harry later wrote that his cousin, Walter Berry, suggested that Houghton Mifflin would publish Caresse's poetry because \"they have just lost Amy Lowell.\" Her work remained relatively conventional, \"still rhyming love with dove,\" by her own admission. A Boston Transcript reviewer said her \"poetry sings,\" and a Literary Review contributor admired her \"charming\" child poems and French flavor. But a critic in the New York Herald Tribune wrote that \"[f]or all its enthusiasm there is no impact to thought or phrase, the emotion is meager, the imagination bridled.\"In April 1927 they founded an English-language publishing company that they first named \u00c9ditions Narcisse, after their black whippet, Narcisse Noir. They used the press as an avenue to publish their own poetry in small editions of finely-made, hard-bound volumes. Their first effort was Caresse's Painted Shores, in which she wrote about their relationship, including their reconciliation after one of Harry's affairs. Her writing matured somewhat, and the book was more creatively organized than her prior efforts. In 1928 she wrote an epic poem which was published as The Stranger. The writing is addressed to the men in her life: her father, husband, and son. In an experimental fashion she explored the various kinds of love she had known. Later that year, Impossible Melodies explored similar themes. The Crosbys enjoyed such a positive reception of their initial work and decided to expand the press to serve other authors.Publishing in Paris during the 1920s and 1930s put the company in the milieu of so many American writers who were living abroad. In 1928, \u00c9ditions Narcisse published a limited edition of 300 numbered copies of \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" by Edgar Allan Poe with illustrations by Alastair.In 1928, Harry and Caresse changed the name of the publishing house to the Black Sun Press, in keeping with Harry's fascination with death and the symbolism of the sun.:\u200a42\u200a Harry developed a private mythology around the sun as a symbol for both life and death, creation, and destruction. The press rapidly gained notice for publishing beautifully bound, typographically flawless editions of unusual books.

They published Kay Boyle's first book-length work, Short Stories, in 1929, and works by Hart Crane, Ernest Hemingway, Eugene Jolas, D. H. Lawrence, Archibald MacLeish, Ezra Pound, and Laurence Sterne. The Black Sun Press evolved into one of the most important small presses in Paris in the 1920s. In 1929, Caresse and Harry both signed poet Eugene Jolas' The Revolution of the Word Proclamation, which appeared in issue 16/17 of the literary journal transition.

The pages of the booklet turn to the right (opposite to that of Western books), and the Old Turkic text is laid out in horizontal right-to-left lines running top-to-bottom down the page. The text of Irk Bitig consists of 104 pages in 52 folios (folios 5b\u201357a), with 40\u201370 characters per page.

The first four and a half folios (including one line overwriting the start of the Old Turkic text) and the last three folios (of which one and a half folios overwrite the Old Turkic colophon) are Buddhist devotional verses written in Chinese. As the Chinese text overwrites the beginning and end of the Old Turkic text, it is believed that the text of Irk Bitig was written first, and that the blank pages at the start and end of the booklet were later filled with the Chinese Buddhist verses.The title by which the book is known, Irk Bitig, meaning \"Book of Omens\", is given at the bottom of the last page of the main text (folio 55b), but the author is not mentioned anywhere.The manuscript text is not precisely dated, but its colophon states that it was written on the 15th day of the second month of the year of the tiger at the Tayg\u00fcntan (Chinese: \u5927\u96f2\u5802; pinyin: D\u00e0y\u00fant\u00e1ng) Manichaean monastery by an anonymous monk for his \"elder brother\", General \u0130ta\u00e7uk (Sa\u014bun \u0130ta\u00e7uk).

For example, Sybase ASE and Microsoft SQL Server have Transact-SQL, PostgreSQL has PL/pgSQL (which emulates PL/SQL to an extent), MariaDB includes a PL/SQL compatibility parser, and IBM Db2 includes SQL Procedural Language, \nwhich conforms to the ISO SQL\u2019s SQL/PSM standard.\nThe designers of PL/SQL modeled its syntax on that of Ada. Both Ada and PL/SQL have Pascal as a common ancestor, and so PL/SQL also resembles Pascal in most aspects. However, the structure of a PL/SQL package does not resemble the basic Object Pascal program structure as implemented by a Borland Delphi or Free Pascal unit. Programmers can define public and private global data-types, constants, and static variables in a PL/SQL package.PL/SQL also allows for the definition of classes and instantiating these as objects in PL/SQL code. This resembles usage in object-oriented programming languages like Object Pascal, C++ and Java. PL/SQL refers to a class as an \"Abstract Data Type\" (ADT) or \"User Defined Type\" (UDT), and defines it as an Oracle SQL data-type as opposed to a PL/SQL user-defined type, allowing its use in both the Oracle SQL Engine and the Oracle PL/SQL engine. The constructor and methods of an Abstract Data Type are written in PL/SQL. The resulting Abstract Data Type can operate as an object class in PL/SQL. Such objects can also persist as column values in Oracle database tables.\nPL/SQL is fundamentally distinct from Transact-SQL, despite superficial similarities. Porting code from one to the other usually involves non-trivial work, not only due to the differences in the feature sets of the two languages, but also due to the very significant differences in the way Oracle and SQL Server deal with concurrency and locking.\nThe StepSqlite product is a PL/SQL compiler for the popular small database SQLite which supports a subset of PL/SQL syntax. Oracle's Berkeley DB 11g R2 release added support for SQL based on the popular SQLite API by including a version of SQLite in Berkeley DB. Consequently, StepSqlite can also be used as a third-party tool to run PL/SQL code on Berkeley DB.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Musically, the song is a UK-style R&B number that serves as a love letter to Amuro's fans. \"Girl Talk\" is a pop dance tune provided by T.

Post-European-contact Chamorro Guamanian culture is a combination of American, Spanish, Filipino, other Micronesian Islander and Mexican traditions. Few indigenous pre-Hispanic customs remained following Spanish contact, but include plaiting and pottery. There has been a resurgence of interest among the Chamorro to preserve the language and culture.Hispanic influences are manifested in the local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (such as batu, chonka, estuleks, and bayogu), songs, and fashion. The island's original community are Chamorro natives, who have inhabited Guam for almost 4000 years. They had their own language related to the languages of Indonesia and southeast Asia. The Spanish later called them Chamorros. A derivative of the word, Chamorri, means \"noble race\". They began to grow rice on the island.\nHistorically, the native people of Guam venerated the bones of their ancestors. They kept the skulls in their houses in small baskets, and practiced incantations before them when it was desired to attain certain objects. During Spanish rule (1668\u20131898) the majority of the population was converted to Catholicism and religious festivities such as Easter and Christmas became widespread. Many Chamorros have Spanish surnames, although few of the inhabitants are themselves descended from the Spaniards. Instead, Spanish names and surnames became commonplace after their conversion to Catholicism and the imposition of the Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos in Guam.Historically, the diet of the native inhabitants of Guam consisted of fish, fowl, rice, breadfruit, taro, yams, bananas, and coconuts used in a variety of dishes. Post-contact Chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn, and includes tortillas, tamales, atole, and chilaquiles, which are a clear influence from Mesoamerica, principally Mexico, from Spanish trade with Asia.Due to foreign cultural influence from Spain, most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost, though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre-Hispanic culture in the last few decades. Some scholars have traveled throughout the Pacific Islands, conducting research to study what the original Chamorro cultural practices such as dance, language, and canoe building may have been like.", "hasanswer": false}]}

IBM provided a wide variety of subroutines, mostly written in assembler, that could be configured into a minimum set to support the peripherals and the application.  The application-specific code was then written on top of the monitor stack.  A minimal useful configuration would run with 8 kilobytes of memory, though in practice the size of the monitor and application program was usually 12kB and upwards.  The maximum configuration had 64kB of memory.  The advanced (for the time) semiconductor memory made the machine fast but also expensive, so a lot of work went into minimizing the typical memory footprint of an application before deployment.  The development tools normally ran on IBM's 360 computer system and the program image was then downloaded to a System/7 in a development lab by serial link.  Up until 1975 at least it was rare to use disk overlays for the programs, with no support for that in the software tools.  Hard disks, in the IBM Dolphin line of sealed cartridges, were available but expensive and were generally used as file systems storing data and executable programs (thereby eliminating the need to rely on the paper tape reader for system boot-up).\nMost work was done in a macro assembly language, with a fairly powerful macro language facility allowing great flexibility in code configuration and generation.  Static variable binding, like Fortran, was the norm and the use of arbitrary subroutine call patterns was rare.  The machines were usually deployed for very fixed jobs with a rigidly planned set of software.  This often extended to the real-time interrupt latency, using the 4 levels of priority and the carefully crafted software paths to ensure guaranteed latencies.  Fortran and a PL/1 subset (PL/7) compilers were available no later than 1976 as larger configurations became more affordable and more complex data processing was required.  System/7 programmers still needed to be aware of the actual instructions that were available for use.\nMuch development work was done on S/360 or S/370 using a variation of the HLASM program geared to the MSP/7 macro language. To provide more flexibility in programming the System/7, a group in the IBM San Jose Research Laboratory in San Jose, California developed the LABS/7 operating environment, which with its language Event Driven Language (EDL), was ported to the Series/1 environment as the very successful Event Driven Executive (EDX).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Journalists, politicians, and citizens alike celebrated the accomplishments of Tarbell \u2013 a woman \"outside\" the inner workings of business and without significant money or influence. These reactions are immortalized in political cartoons utilizing imagery of Rockefeller's hidden agendas being demolished by investigative journalism and muckraking.Several journal and newspaper reviewers addressed The History of Standard Oil Company by praising its calmness in the face of hatred, focus on facts, and genuine exposure of the effects that greed can have on businessmen seeking success. A 1904 editorial review from The New York Times relayed the highlights of the volumes to the public, noting the diplomatic tendencies of Tarbell within her work \u2013 still widely respectful of the achievements of John D. Rockefeller but critical of Standard Oil's business strategies that were unfair and of questionable legality. One review from the Economic Journal fixated on the monumental nature of Tarbell's work, stating that \"it is difficult to write about Miss Tarbell's remarkable achievement without using language approaching the edge of hyperbole. So careful is she in her facts, so sane in her judgements, that she seems to have reached the high-water mark of industrial history.\"Though Standard Oil Company accrued more cumulative value after it was broken up, the exposure of what Tarbell described as immoral and illegal business became a striking symbol of the power of the press. As such, The History of Standard Oil Company harbors great significance as a standard-bearer of modern investigative journalism.In 1999 a jury under the aegis of the New York University's journalism department selected The History of the Standard Oil Company as the fifth best work of journalism in the United States in the 20th Century.  In his  2008 book Taking on the Trust: The Epic Battle of Ida Tarbell and John D. Rockefeller, Steve Weinberg described the exposure of Standard Oil as \"arguably the greatest work of investigative journalism ever written\".In a 2010 column, libertarian-conservative economist Thomas Sowell criticized Tarbell for what he characterized as cherry picking which data to include in her book: \"One of the crucial facts left out of Ida Tarbell's book was that Rockefeller's improvements in the oil industry brought down the price of oil to a fraction of what it had been before.[...] Would the public have been better off if older and more costly methods of producing, processing and shipping oil had continued to be used, leading to prices far higher than necessary?\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Juvet's father sold radios and televisions, which sparked an early interest in music for the young Juvet. Juvet began studying piano at age 7; later he developed an interest in the music of The Beatles.Juvet moved to Paris in 1968 at the age of 18 with little money. A friend encouraged him to become a model in Germany, and Juvet pursued this career in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, for two years. He returned to Paris in 1970.In Saint-Tropez he met French music producer Eddie Barclay, who allowed him to record a first single in 1971. He wrote \"Le Lundi au soleil\", sung by Claude Fran\u00e7ois. Later, Juvet began collaborating with French composer and musician Jean-Michel Jarre with this new material featured on Juvet's album, Love, which was released in 1973. Juvet represented Switzerland at the Eurovision Song Contest 1973 with \"Je vais me marier, Marie,\" placing at no. 12 in the competition.In 1977, Juvet collaborated again with Jarre on the French-language album, Paris by Night, which featured the hit song, \"O\u00f9 sont les femmes?\" In 1978, he worked with noted disco producers Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo, who also produced Village People and The Ritchie Family, among other acts. As a result, Juvet soon experienced international success with the disco tracks, \"Got a Feeling\" and \"I Love America\".In 1978, the aforementioned \"O\u00f9 sont les femmes?\" was re-recorded in English under the title, \"Where Is My Woman?\", and was featured on Juvet's English-language debut on Casablanca Records in the U.S. Victor Willis, original lead singer of Village People, was the lyricist for the project.His soundtrack score to David Hamilton's art house film Laura featured disco musicians Marc Chantereau and Slim Pezin of Voyage and Space session bassist Jannick Top. Although the music from Laura was never released on compact disc and was never released in the United States, it nonetheless sold 650,000 copies. Parts of the music were written and produced by the New Zealander Brian Southcombe (now deceased) who was once married to Charlotte Rampling. Southcombe, David Hamilton and another New Zealander (Hamilton's business manager) were at one time actively trying to set up a sequel movie to Laura and are said to have approached Juvet for more music. \nWith the decline of disco in the early 1980s, Juvet returned to the French music scene in 1982 with the album, R\u00eaves immoraux. While selling respectably, the album failed to match Juvet's earlier commercial success. A time of financial and personal decline followed, with Juvet suffering periods of depression and alcoholism and relocating from mainland Europe to London, then to Los Angeles and finally, in the latter half of the 1980s, back to Switzerland.Juvet returned to Paris in 1991 and to his roots as a singer-songwriter with the album, Solitudes. The disc featured more personal, emotional songs with Juvet being accompanied by French-language performers, Fran\u00e7oise Hardy, Luc Plamondon, and Marc Lavoine.In 2005, Juvet released his autobiography Les bleus au c\u0153ur: Souvenirs (\"Bruises on My Heart: Memories\"), in which he talks about his career and his bisexuality. On 1 April 2021, it was announced that Juvet was found dead at his apartment in Barcelona, aged 70.

It was founded by Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti. Prior to this, Arianna Huffington hosted the website Ariannaonline.com. Her first foray into the Internet was the website Resignation.com, which called for the resignation of President Bill Clinton and was a rallying place for conservatives opposing Clinton.An early Huffington Post strategy was crafting search-engine optimized (SEO) stories and headlines based around trending keywords, such as \"What Time Is the Super Bowl?\"In August 2006, The Huffington Post raised a $5 million Series A round from SoftBank Capital and Greycroft.In December 2008, The Huffington Post raised $25 million from Oak Investment Partners at a $100 million valuation and Fred Harman of Oak Investment Partners joined its board of directors. The money was to be used for technology, infrastructure, investigative journalism, and development of local versions.In June 2009, Eric Hippeau, co-managing partner of Softbank Capital, became CEO of The Huffington Post.In January 2011, The Huffington Post received 35% of its traffic from web search engines (SEOs), compared to 20% at CNN. This strategy appealed to AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who tried to implement similar SEO-driven journalism practices at AOL at the time of its acquisition of The Huffington Post.In March 2011, AOL acquired The Huffington Post for US$315 million. As part of the deal, Huffington became president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post and existing AOL properties Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone, MapQuest, Black Voices, PopEater (now HuffPost Celebrity), AOL Music, AOL Latino (now HuffPost Voices), AutoBlog, Patch, and StyleList.In December 2011, The Huffington Post said it had 36.2 million unique visitors.The Huffington Post subsumed many of AOL's Voices properties, including AOL Black Voices, which was established in 1995 as Blackvoices.com, and AOL Latino, Impact (launched in 2010 as a partnership between Huffington Post and Causecast), Women, Teen, College, Religion, and the Spanish-language Voces (en espa\u00f1ol). The Voices brand was expanded in September 2011 with the launch of Gay Voices, dedicated to LGBT-relevant articles.By late 2013, the website operated as a \"stand-alone business\" within AOL, taking control of more of its own business and advertising operations, and directing more effort towards securing \"premium advertising\".In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4 billion and the site became a part of Verizon Media.Huffington resigned to pursue other ventures and was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Lydia Polgreen in December 2016.In April 2017, Polgreen announced the company would rebrand, changing its official full name to HuffPost, with changes to the design of its website and logo, and content and reporting.On January 24, 2019, 20 employees were laid off as a part of Verizon Media laying off 7% of its staff. The opinion and health sections were eliminated. Pulitzer Prize finalist Jason Cherkis lost his job.On March 6, 2020, Polgreen announced that she would step down as editor-in-chief to become the head of content at Gimlet Media.In November 2020, HuffPost shut down its India operation after six years. According to some media reports, the acquisition did not include the India site due to regulations barring foreign ownership of Indian Digital Media.On February 16, 2021, BuzzFeed acquired HuffPost from Verizon Media in a stock deal. On March 9, 2021, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said that the company had lost \"around $20 million\" during the previous year, and HuffPost Canada was shut down and ceased publishing.\nOn April 12, 2021, Danielle Belton became editor-in-chief.Following the gradual shut-down of BuzzFeed News announced in 2023, BuzzFeed, Inc. refocused its news efforts into HuffPost, with plans to rehire past BuzzFeed News employees at HuffPost or  at BuzzFeed.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Images from the \"Moon and \"Mutual Core\" music videos accompany her speech. After that, some frames focus on the Graduale Nobili who are singing the backing vocals to \"Thunderbolt\" on a cliff in front of the ocean in Iceland. Thereafter the scene shifts to an early rehearsal of the Biophilia songs in Iceland during November 2010. The choir begin to learn their parts in \"Thunderbolt\" and \"Moon\" under the guide of the singer. After that, the documentary shows the encounter between Bj\u00f6rk and Sir David Attenborough in the Natural History Museum in London. There, the naturalist and the singer discuss about the nature of music. They first talk about the importance of music and singing in the nature, with Attenborough explaining how music works for birds like the bird-of-paradise and the lyrebird, whose chirping is defined by the naturalist the \"most complex sound ever\", and he goes on by stating that the bird has developed an \"impressive vocal range\" which he compares to that of Bj\u00f6rk. Attenborough states that the human larynx is capable of many more sounds that preceded language. Therefore, the singer asks him how he thinks music works for the modern people, and the naturalist explains how he thinks popular music is \"extremely sexual\", comparing popular music to medieval troubadors, and that is why is so relatable to young people and animals, i.e. the gibbons, which mate by singing together out of excitement. Attenborough affirms that \"the mystery is how music has been used by humanity for something that is transcendental\".\nFootage from another rehearsal with the choir singing \"Dark Matter\" are shown before shifting to the encounter between Bj\u00f6rk and Henry Dagg in a metal workshop. Dagg had created the Sharpsichord, a solar powered cross between a harp and a barrel organ, which Bj\u00f6rk wanted to incorporate in one song. They are shown rehearsing \"Sacrifice\" and discussing the composition of the song. Attenborough states that our emotion comes from nature and that a composer has to be in contact with it. He then manages to compare the sound of Benjamin Britten's Sea interludes (which is playing in the background) to the sound of waves. The natural structure of music inspires Bj\u00f6rk who wants to bring nature in her composition. To discuss \"Crystalline\", Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough go to the crystal room of the museum. They talk about the mathematical basis of Bj\u00f6rk's songs, who explains the time signatures of the verses and the chorus of \"Crystalline\" and compares the composition of a crystal to that of a song. Scenes from the choir recording parts of \"Crystalline\" guided by Biophilia musical director Matt Robertson are shown. Attenborough thinks that the beauty of mathematics can be heard in composition like the \"Fugue 5\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. Swinton tells how universe is made of patterns which are present in music but that we can't visualise, and how Bj\u00f6rk wants to change that. Because of that, the singer collaborates with Evan Grant, who works with cymatics. Grant explains how the Chladni plate works, and that he appreciates how Bj\u00f6rk tries to bring a real meaning in her music by taking a \"scientific and realistic approach\" to it. Grant tries to use cymatics on water for \"Crystalline\", which results can be seen in the music video for the song (directed by Michel Gondry).\nSwinton explains how Bj\u00f6rk's aim is to bring nature on stage for the Biophilia performance. Footage from the final rehearsal at Campfield Market Hall in Manchester for Biophilia world premiere at the Manchester International Festival is shown, with the Sharpsichord arriving at the venue. Some of other instruments used during the show are presented, like MIDI-controlled Tesla coil, invented by Nikola Tesla, and a gravity-harnessed pendulum harp invented by Andy Cavatorta of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Cavatorta recounts how Bj\u00f6rk declared to him that she wanted nature to appear like \"some sort of a rock star on stage\", and tells that the first prototypes of the instruments were filmed and shown to Bj\u00f6rk before she approved the final result. In one of the prototypes video the inventor puts a figurine of Bj\u00f6rk (as pictured in the Volta album cover) between the swings. The instrument, created solely for the \"Solstice\" performance, was commissioned because, as Bj\u00f6rk declares, the singer \"got obsessed\" with basslines (she hums a bassline of a composition by John Tavener as she says so).\n\nOne of the major inspiration of the project itself, neurologist Oliver Sacks, who Bj\u00f6rk define as the \"David Attenborough of the brain\", lists the benefits music has on human and explains how when a human listens to music every part of the brain gets involved. This is very useful to people who suffers from dementia, who need evocative music which can help them in building a bridge to their past. Scenes from a nursing home, in which various patients with dementia are shown to benefit from different music played to them, accompany Sacks' speech. He affirms that the music expresses something that language can't.\nScenes from the first performance of Biophilia are shown. David Attenborough's intro, which accompany the show, is partially heard, while Bj\u00f6rk affirms that music is a catalyst between the outer world and the inner world. A performance of \"Thunderbolt\" is partially shown, during which the singer is seen wearing a dress by Michael van der Ham, along with a big red wig, while the Tesla coil plays on stage. Swinton states that Biophilia \"nature, music and technology come together\" and that the Icelandic singer wants to develop a new kind of music-making which is \"intuitive and accessible for everyone\". This is driven by her desire to change we think of music, because, as the singer herself explains, by recounting her musical education, the \"academic approach to music is a barrier to people actually making music\". Oliver Sacks agrees with her by stating that the sheet music and the keys of a piano are \"intimidating and much more complicated than language\". Because of that, the singer tries to use technology to make it more intuitive. As a consequence of this, Bj\u00f6rk works with Damian Taylor. Taylor tries to use a ball and a cardboard box, along with a gamepad, instead of a keyboard. Bj\u00f6rk's solution came with the diffusion of tablet computer, which touch screen the singer compares to a tambourine for its being spontaneous and instinctive. By developing this idea, she decides to make a different format of album, made with apps. She works with interactive media artist Scott Snibbe, who states that her aim is the turn music \"into something full sensory\".\nBj\u00f6rk explains some of the apps that are part of the album, like \"Moon\", which app deals with sequences, \"Mutual Core\", in which chords are represented with strata, and \"Thunderbolt\", which use lightnings as visual representation of arpeggios. Bj\u00f6rk states that a famous example of arpeggio is \"I Feel Love\" by Donna Summer. Snibbe then affirms that, \"if we change the visual representation, the way in which people think about music is changed\". To engage people with her new conception of music, Bj\u00f6rk rolls out a programme of music workshops for children in school around the world (footage from a workshop in Buenos Aires is shown) which, as Swinton informs, is now a standard part of the music curriculum in Iceland. Bj\u00f6rk confesses that she always dreamt about running a music school and that she considers this project her music school. After one year from the first show in Manchester, the Biophilia Tour reaches the World Sacred Music Festival in Fes, Morocco, during which Bj\u00f6rk is seen performing \"Cosmogony\". Sacks finally states that \"music unify people at an elementary level\". The documentary ends with a final conversation between Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough, in which the naturalist affirms:\n\n\"Music, to be most rewarding, [...] does require work, and does require concentration, does require thought, which is why your music is so challenging, because it does require thought. So much of what you do, is completely new, [and] hasn't been done by people before, and that's what's challenging about that. So, if you're very tired, I don't suggest that they put on your music. I put on your music when I really want to think about something.\"\nTo which Bj\u00f6rk blushes, and then the pair laugh together. The end credits roll to \"Cosmogony\" in the background.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The earliest known record of the name dates from 1577, but early records are spelling variations of the modern name (such as Helvillon, Helvelon or Hell Belyn) rather than any help with the etymology. Various attempts to interpret the name have been made in the past. Some, led by the present spelling, possibly wrongly thought the final syllable was the Welsh word llyn, \"lake\" which has various historic spellings including 'lin' and 'lynn'. Richard Coates in 1988 proposed a Celtic derivation from the deduced Cumbric word hal, \"moorland\", and velin, the Cumbric equivalent of the Welsh word melyn meaning \"yellow.\" Hel is a Welsh word meaning to gather, drive or hunt, and helfa (historically spelt helva) has been used to describe a portion of mountain from which sheep are collected.\nRecent place-name studies have accepted the \"yellow moorland\" derivation, but have struggled to understand how Helvellyn can be regarded as a yellow mountain. Colour, in the Celtic languages, is perceived differently from the way it is seen and described in modern English. For example, in Scottish Gaelic the spectrum of colours was \"pastel rather than primary, gentle rather than bold.\" Colours were related to a landscape context in which blues, greens, greys and whites in particular were both more diverse and more differentiated than in English. People who relied on the system of transhumance for their livelihood gained the ability to assess the nutritional value of upland grasses from a distance before moving their stock to a summer shieling, and used appropriate colour terms for grasses which would become progressively more green as the spring advanced.:\u200a195\u200a Yellow, at least in Gaelic hill names, is not a bright colour. It describes hills which are distinguished by grasses such as Nardus stricta and Deschampsia flexuosa, both of which appear pale and bleached in winter.:\u200a197\u200a These grasses are common on the Helvellyn range, in an area where transhumance also used to be practiced. Nardus stricta in particular is an unpalatable and unproductive grass, and the Flora of Cumbria specifically notes a possible connection between areas of late snow cover and Nardus grassland at high elevations in the Helvellyn range. A name describing the mountain as \"pale yellow moorland\" is therefore meaningful in a Celtic context.\nLower Man. The mountain has two tops, which used to be distinguished as Helvellyn Low Man (or Lower Man) and Helvellyn High Man (or Higher Man). Both are drawn and labelled on a panoramic view of the range found in Jonathan Otley's guidebook of 1823.Striding Edge. An edge in mountain place-names is a steep escarpment, on either one side or (as here) on both sides.:\u200a396\u200a The first reference to Striding Edge was by Walter Scott in 1805 as Striden-edge. A map of 1823 called it Strathon Edge. It is possible that \"Striding Edge\" has replaced an earlier name, now lost.Swirral Edge may be either \"The precipitous ridge that causes giddiness\" or \"The precipitous ridge where the wind or snow swirls around.\" An edge is a steep escarpment, as above.:\u200a396\u200a Swirrel, a dialect variation of \"swirl\" has two possible explanations.

The published photographs were also limited by the color printing technologies of the time, and some of the darker birds have been described as looking like \"they had been dipped in shoe polish.\"Among the \"birds conspicuously black\" in the book is the red-winged blackbird, which is introduced this way:\n\nIn oozy pastures where a brook lazily finds its way through the farm is the ideal pleasure ground of this \"bird of society.\" His notes, \"h'-wa-ker-ee\" or \"con-quer-ee\" (on an ascending scale), are liquid in quality, suggesting the sweet, moist, cool retreats where he nests ... satisfied with cut-worms, grubs, and insects, or with fruit and grain for his food \u2013 the blackbird is an impressive and helpful example of how to get the best out of life.\n\nOn publication, The New York Times praised the book's color prints and its ability to be \"understood by all readers,\" and the following year included it in a list of \"150 books for summer reading.\" Bird Neighbors sold over 250,000 copies, helping to make the author the best-selling female nature writer of her time.Originally published by Doubleday, the book was republished by the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation in 1999.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was Verdi's penultimate opera, first performed at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan, on 5 February 1887.\nThe composer was reluctant to write anything new after the success of Aida in 1871, and he retreated into retirement. It took his Milan publisher Giulio Ricordi the next ten years, first to encourage the revision of Verdi's 1857 Simon Boccanegra by introducing Boito as librettist and then to begin the arduous process of persuading and cajoling Verdi to see Boito's completed libretto for Otello in July/August 1881. However, the process of writing the first drafts of the libretto and the years of their revision, with Verdi all along not promising anything, dragged on. It wasn't until 1884, five years after the first drafts of the libretto, that composition began, with most of the work finishing in late 1885. When it finally premiered in Milan on 5 February 1887, it proved to be a resounding success, and further stagings of Otello soon followed at leading theatres throughout Europe and America.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Coconut milk is not included in this definition and many Thai curries, such as kaeng som and kaeng pa, do not feature it. Curries in Lanna (northern Thai) cuisine, with only a few exceptions, do not use coconut milk due to coconut palms not growing well, if at all, in the climate of the Thai highlands. The spiciness of Thai curries depends on the amount and kind of chilli used in the making of the paste. Even within one type of curry the spiciness can differ widely.\nThe word \"curry\" figures in the Thai language as \"kari\" (Thai: \u0e01\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e35\u0e48), and refers to dishes using either an Indian-style curry powder, known as phong kari in Thailand, or to the dish called kaeng kari, an Indian-influenced curry that is made with spices that are common to Indian dishes but less often used in these proportions in Thai cuisine. Kung phat phong kari (prawns fried with egg and curry powder) is an example of a dish using the Indian style curry powder.Although \"kaeng\" is also defined as being of \"watery\" substance, the thickness of the sauce can vary considerably from broth-like to that of a thick stew, and it can even be a completely dry dish. Representatives of dry curries, dishes which are (stir-)fried with a curry paste, are phat phrik khing and khua kling. Kaeng som and keang pa are representatives of the more broth-like curries. Matsaman and kaeng khua resemble stews. Ho mok pla (a steamed fish curry), kaeng kradang (curry aspic from northern Thailand) and noodle dishes such as khanom chin nam ngiao are also seen as Thai curry dishes as they all use curry pastes in their preparation.\nThe dish called kaeng chuet is an exception to the rule that a kaeng should contain chillies, garlic, onions and shrimp paste. It is a clear Chinese-style meat and/or vegetable broth with mixed vegetables and often also minced pork, tofu and glass noodles. The name translates as \"bland curry\" but it is seen as being a tom, a soup, and it is therefore also often called tom chuet.Curries are eaten in combination with rice, the long-grained jasmine rice in central and southern Thailand and sticky rice in northern and northeastern Thailand, and with noodles such as khanom chin (fermented rice noodles). Certain curries can also be eaten with roti, the Thai version of the Indian-style fried flat bread from Malaysia called roti canai.\nKhao kaeng or khao rat kaeng, meaning \"curry-on-rice\", is a traditional type of fast food restaurant in Thailand which specialises in ready-made curries, and often several other dishes as well, served with rice.

According to his own descriptions, Brook's goals are related to those of sacred and ritual theater.

The album entered the US charts at number 12, with 65,000 copies sold in the first week, the highest any Oasis album had reached there since 1997's Be Here Now, although its chart stay was brief.

On some of the tracks regular bass player Andy Bell handled guitar, while Gem Archer and Noel Gallagher contributed bass to other songs. Don't Believe the Truth is the first Oasis record to feature the drumming of Zak Starkey, an auxiliary member of Oasis, who performed and toured with them following the departure of longtime drummer Alan White, and appeared on the DVD praising all members' contributions. The album received positive reviews from critics, and many cited it as Oasis' best album in a decade.\nLiam Gallagher also had a larger impact on the album through his developing songwriting. Noel has said that the album is his favourite of Oasis' last four, because all members contributed to it. This, he claims, has given it a different feel from a typically Noel-written Oasis album.\nThe band embarked on a massive worldwide tour that started off at the London Astoria for their Don't Believe the Truth Tour, visiting 26 countries and playing to 3.2 million people at a total of 113 concerts.

Those producers are just some of whom worked with Amuro on her preceding album Style. Amuro contributed as the main and background vocalist.\nThe title track is a bouncy R&B number with a great combination of hand claps and floating synths. The Michico and SUGI-V penned song \"Want Me, Want Me\" is a reggae-style dance tune with an addictive loop that incorporates Japanese elements like the koto that plays during the intro. Atypical for Amuro, the song contains sexually aggressive lyrics and even name-drops the condom brand Trojan. The song \"WoWa\" (pronounced \"Ooh Wah\") is an uptempo R&B and dance-pop number with an impressive arrangement that mixes sounds made by real people, such as marching, hand claps, and flutes, which was custom-tailored by Nao'ymt. \"I Wanna Show You My Love\" was written by Michico while its music was composed by T.Kura & Michico. Musically, the song is a UK-style R&B number that serves as a love letter to Amuro's fans. \"Girl Talk\" is a pop dance tune provided by T. Kura and Michico. \"Free\" is a mid-tempo Southern hip hop tune with a dark intro that develops into a bewitching rhythmic synth sound which was written by Nao'ymt. \"My Darling\" is a soulful Crunk&B number written by Michico while its music was tailor-made by T.Kura & Michico. \"Ups & Downs\" is a midtempo R&B number featuring Nao'ymt, who also produced it. \"Ups & Downs\" was originally planned to be sung solo, but after Amuro heard Nao'ymt singing the song exceptionally, Amuro told him, \"I would love to sing it with you,\" and decided to make it a duet.\"I Love You\" is a disco pop number with sparkling rhythmic bouncing sounds. The words 'I love you' are said four times during the chorus in four different languages (French, English, Spanish and Chinese). The track is a Tricky Stewart-produced cover with Japanese lyrics. \"All for You\" is the album's sole ballad, which is written by Natsumi Watanabe and musically composed by Ryoki Matsumoto. \"Alarm\" is a pop and R&B song with a heavy bass which was written by Jusme and composed by Monk. \"No\" is an exciting club tune with a bouncy sound which was crafted by Nao'ymt. The bridge, with its handclaps and synths, stirs up calls of \"N-A-M-I-E.\" After the song \"No\", there is a hidden track which has no official title but is known to fans as \"No Pt.2\" or \"Yes\". At 4:06, the listener begins to hear the subtle sounds of the hidden track beginning. The song is a slower version of \"No\" with new lyrics and vocals.

The hymn first appeared in print in a 1626 collection of Dutch folk and patriotic songs, Neder-landtsche Gedenck-Clanck by Adriaen Valerius.\nIn anglophone hymnology, the tune is known as \"Kremser\", from Eduard Kremser's 1877 score arrangement and lyric translation of Wilt Heden Nu Treden into Latin and German. The modern English text was written by Theodore Baker in 1894.\nAccording to the Hymn Society in the United States and Canada, \"We Gather Together's\" first appearance in an American hymnal was in 1903. It had retained popularity among the Dutch, and when the Dutch Reformed Church in North America decided in 1937 to abandon the policy that they had brought with them to the New World in the 17th century of singing only psalms and add hymns to the church service,  \"We Gather Together\" was chosen as the first hymn in the first hymnal.A different translation under the first line We Praise Thee, O God, Our Redeemer, Creator was translated by J.B.C. Cory (1882-1963).The hymn steadily gained popularity, especially in services of Thanksgiving on such occasions as town and college centennial celebrations.   According to Carl Daw, executive director of the Hymn Society, the \"big break\" came in 1935 when it was included in the national hymnal of the Methodist-Episcopal Church.According to Michael Hawn, professor of sacred music at Southern Methodist University's Perkins School of Theology, \"by World War I, we started to see ourselves in this hymn,\" and the popularity increased during World War II, when \"the wicked oppressing\" were understood to include Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.This hymn is often sung at American churches the Sunday before Thanksgiving.\nThis hymn was sung at the Opening of the Funeral Mass for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The West Wing episode \"Shibboleth\" (season 2, episode 8 \"Shibboleth\") alluded to the hymn, and it was played in the episode's final scene (performed by the Cedarmont Kids.)The hymn is also usually sung by the Quartermaine family on the American soap opera General Hospital's annual Thanksgiving episode.", "hasanswer": false}]}
