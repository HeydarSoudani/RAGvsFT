{"id": "40_8", "question": "Who is Anne Boleyn's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_68364", "text": "Anne was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, and his wife, Elizabeth Howard, who was the eldest daughter of Thomas Howard, then Earl of Surrey and future 2nd Duke of Norfolk, and his first wife Elizabeth Tilney. Anne's date of birth is unknown.\nAs with Anne, it is uncertain when her two siblings were born, but it seems clear that her sister Mary was older than Anne. Mary's children clearly believed their mother was the elder sister. Mary's grandson claimed the Ormond title in 1596 on the basis that she was the elder daughter, which Elizabeth I accepted. Their brother George was born around 1504. Thomas Boleyn, writing in the 1530s, stated that his children were born before the death of his father, William Boleyn, in 1505.\nThe academic debate about Anne's birth date focuses on two key dates: c.\u20091501 and c.\u20091507. Eric Ives, a British historian and legal expert, advocates 1501, while Retha Warnicke, an American scholar who has also written a biography of Anne, prefers 1507. The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514. She wrote it in French to her father, who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education at Mechelen, in the Burgundian Netherlands, now Belgium. Ives argues that the style of the letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about 13 at the time of its composition, while Warnicke argues that the numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child. In Ives's view, this would also be around the minimum age that a girl could be a maid of honour, as Anne was to the regent, Margaret of Austria. This is supported by claims of a chronicler from the late 16th century, who wrote that Anne was 20 when she returned from France. These findings are contested by Warnicke in several books and articles, and the evidence does not conclusively support either date.An independent contemporary source supports the 1507 date: William Camden wrote a history of the reign of Elizabeth I and was granted access to the private papers of Lord Burghley and to the state archives. In that history, in the chapter dealing with Elizabeth's early life, he records that Anne was born in 1507.Anne's paternal ancestor, Geoffrey Boleyn, had been a mercer and wool merchant before becoming Lord Mayor. The Boleyn family originally came from Blickling in Norfolk, 15 miles (24 km) north of Norwich. Anne's relatives included the Howards, one of the preeminent families in England; and Anne's ancestors included King Edward I of England. According to Eric Ives, she was certainly of more noble birth than Jane Seymour and Catherine Parr, Henry VIII's other English wives. The spelling of the Boleyn name was variable, as common at the time. Sometimes it was written as Bullen, hence the bull's heads which formed part of her family arms.At the court of Margaret of Austria in the Netherlands, Anne is listed as Boullan. From there she signed the letter to her father as Anna de Boullan. She was also called \"Anna Bolina\"; this Latinised form is used in most portraits of her.Anne's early education was typical for women of her class. In 1513, she was invited to join the schoolroom of Margaret of Austria and her four wards. Her academic education was limited to arithmetic, her family genealogy, grammar, history, reading, spelling and writing. She also developed domestic skills such as dancing, embroidery, good manners, household management, music, needlework and singing. Anne learned to play games, such as cards, chess and dice. She was also taught archery, falconry, horseback riding and hunting.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Nehru was a principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon India's independence in 1947, he served as the country's first prime minister for 16 years. Nehru promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he steered India clear of the two blocs of the Cold War. A well-regarded author, his books written in prison, such as Letters from a Father to His Daughter (1929), An Autobiography (1936) and The Discovery of India (1946), have been read around the world. \nThe son of Motilal Nehru, a prominent lawyer and Indian nationalist, Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in England\u2014at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner Temple. He became a barrister, returned to India, enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and gradually began to take an interest in national politics, which eventually became a full-time occupation. He joined the Indian National Congress, rose to become the leader of a progressive faction during the 1920s, and eventually of the Congress, receiving the support of Mahatma Gandhi who was to designate Nehru as his political heir. As Congress president in 1929, Nehru called for complete independence from the British Raj.\nNehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s. Nehru promoted the idea of the secular nation-state in the 1937 provincial elections, allowing the Congress to sweep the elections, and to form governments in several provinces. In September 1939, the Congress ministries resigned to protest Viceroy Lord Linlithgow's decision to join the war without consulting them. After the All India Congress Committee's Quit India Resolution of 8 August 1942, senior Congress leaders were imprisoned and for a time the organisation was suppressed. Nehru, who had reluctantly heeded Gandhi's call for immediate independence, and had desired instead to support the Allied war effort during World War II, came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape. The Muslim League, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, had come to dominate Muslim politics in the interim. In the 1946 provincial elections, Congress won the elections but the League won all the seats reserved for Muslims, which the British interpreted to be a clear mandate for Pakistan in some form. Nehru became the interim prime minister of India in September 1946, with the League joining his government with some hesitancy in October 1946.\nUpon India's independence on 15 August 1947, Nehru gave a critically acclaimed speech, \"Tryst with Destiny\"; he was sworn in as the Dominion of India's prime minister and raised the Indian flag at the Red Fort in Delhi. On 26 January 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, Nehru became the Republic of India's first prime minister. He embarked on an ambitious program of economic, social, and political reforms. Nehru promoted a pluralistic multi-party democracy. In foreign affairs, he played a leading role in establishing Non-Aligned Movement, a group of nations that did not seek membership in the two main ideological blocs of the Cold War.\nUnder Nehru's leadership, the Congress emerged as a catch-all party, dominating national and state-level politics and winning elections in 1951, 1957 and 1962. His premiership, spanning 16 years and 286 days\u2014which is, to date, the longest in India\u2014ended with his death in 1964 from a heart attack.

For reasons lost to history, Lady Liu and Chen Shubao were not taken to Chang'an, but left at Rang City (\u7a70\u57ce; R\u00e1ng ch\u00e9ng, now in Nanyang, Henan province).\nIn 557, Chen Xu's uncle and Chen Chang's father Chen Baxian founded a new dynasty as Emperor Wu of Chen with his capital at Jiankang.  He requested that Western Wei's successor state, Northern Zhou, return Chen Chang and Chen Xu to him, but Northern Zhou, while initially agreeing, did not do so during Emperor Wu's lifetime.  In 559, Emperor Wu died, and Chen Xu's older brother Chen Qian, Prince of Linchuan, as Emperor Wu's only close male relative in the realm, took the throne as Emperor Wen of Chen.  In 560, Northern Zhou began making overtures to return Chen Xu to Chen.  In 562, Emperor Wen, who had remotely created Chen Xu the Prince of Ancheng, traded the city of Lushan (\u9b6f\u5c71, in modern Wuhan, Hubei) to Northern Zhou in exchange for Chen Xu's return.  Initially, Chen Shubao and his mother Princess Liu were not returned, but after further negotiations by Emperor Wen, were returned.  Chen Shubao was designated as Chen Xu's successor.  He held minor offices during Emperor Wen's reign.\nIn 566, Emperor Wen died and was succeeded by his son, Crown Prince Chen Bozong, as Emperor Fei. The high-level officials that Emperor Wen left in charge, including Chen Xu, eventually became locked in a power struggle, and in 567, Chen Xu killed Liu Shizhi (\u5289\u5e2b\u4e4b) and Dao Zhongju (\u5230\u4ef2\u8209) and seized control. In winter 568, he had an edict issued in the name of Emperor Wu's wife Grand Empress Dowager Zhang Yao'er that deposed Emperor Fei and he took the throne as Emperor Xuan in spring 569. Chen Shubao was made crown prince, and his mother, Princess Liu, was made empress.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "40_20", "question": "Who is Lucius Marcius Philippus's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_26205", "text": "De Oratore, Book III is the third part of De Oratore by Cicero. It describes the death of Lucius Licinius Crassus.\nThey belong to the generation, which precedes the one of Cicero: the main characters of the dialogue are Marcus Antonius (not the triumvir) and Lucius Licinius Crassus (not the unofficial triumvir); other friends of them, such as Gaius Iulius Caesar (not the dictator), Sulpicius and Scaevola intervene occasionally.\nAt the beginning of the third book, which contains Crassus' exposition, Cicero is hit by a sad memory. He expresses all his pain to his brother Quintus Cicero. He reminds him that only nine days after the dialogue, described in this work, Crassus died suddenly. He came back to Rome the last day of the ludi scaenici (19 September 91 BC), very worried by the speech of the consul Lucius Marcius Philippus. He made a speech before the people, claiming the creation of a new council in place of the Roman Senate, with which he could not govern the State any longer. Crassus went to the curia (the palace of the Senate) and heard the speech of Drusus, reporting Lucius Marcius Philippus' speech and attacking him.\nIn that occasion, everyone agreed that Crassus, the best orator of all, overcame himself with his eloquence. He blamed the situation and the abandonment of the Senate: the consul, who should be his good father and faithful defender, was depriving it of its dignity like a robber. No need of surprise, indeed, if he wanted to deprive the State of the Senate, after having ruined the first one with his disastrous projects.\nPhilippus was a vigorous, eloquent and smart man: when he was attacked by the Crassus' firing words, he counter-attacked him until he made him keep silent. But Crassus replied:\" You, who destroyed the authority of the Senate before the Roman people, do you really think to intimidate me? If you want to keep me silent, you have to cut my tongue. And even if you do it, my spirit of freedom will hold tight your arrogance\".\nCrassus' speech lasted a long time and he spent all of his spirit, his mind and his forces. Crassus' resolution was approved by the Senate, stating that \"not the authority nor the loyalty of the Senate ever abandoned the Roman State\". When he was speaking, he had a pain in his side and, after he came home, he got fever and died of pleurisy in six days.\n\"How insecure is the destiny of a man!\", Cicero says. Just in the peak of his public career, Crassus reached the top of the authority, but also destroyed all his expectations and plans for the future by his death.\nThis sad episode caused pain, not only to Crassus' family, but also to all the honest citizens. Cicero adds that, in his opinion, the immortal gods gave Crassus his death as a gift, to preserve him from seeing the calamities that would befall the State a short time later. Indeed, he has not seen Italy burning by the social war (91-87 BC), neither the people's hate against the Senate, the escape and return of Gaius Marius, the following revenges, killings and violence.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, he is also faulted for passing on his massive build and hard-pounding stride action, rendering many of his descendants vulnerable to injury. In the mid-2000s, there had been a troubling number of high profile breakdowns, including that of Barbaro (who was distantly related to Native Dancer through his dam.) As the grandsire of both Mr. Prospector and Northern Dancer, the two most important sires of the late twentieth century, a certain degree of inbreeding to Native Dancer became inevitable, potentially exacerbating the issue. \"There's a lack of durability right now,\" said Ric Waldman, the former head of operations for Windfields Farm. \"We're dealing with the law of diminishing returns.\" Vanderbilt's son Alfred G. Vanderbilt defended the stallion's legacy. \"All these great horses are not descended from him because he's fragile,\" he said. \"They're descended because he was a champion and he was durable.\"Native Dancer died on November 16, 1967, following the surgical removal of a tumor on the wall of the small intestine.

He was the son and successor of Bahram I (r.\u2009271\u2013274). Bahram II, while still in his teens, ascended the throne with the aid of the powerful Zoroastrian priest Kartir, just like his father had done.\nHe was met with considerable challenges during his reign, facing a rebellion in the east led by his brother, the Kushano-Sasanian dynast Hormizd I Kushanshah, who also assumed the title of King of Kings and possibly laid claims to the Sasanian throne. Another rebellion, led by Bahram II's cousin Hormizd of Sakastan in Sakastan, also occurred around this period. In Khuzestan, a Zoroastrian factional revolt led by a high-priest (mowbed) occurred. The Roman emperor Carus exploited the turbulent situation of Iran by launching a campaign into its holdings in Mesopotamia in 283. Bahram II, who was in the east, was unable to mount an effective coordinated defense at the time, possibly losing his capital of Ctesiphon to the Roman emperor. However, Carus died soon afterwards, reportedly being struck by lightning. As a result, the Roman army withdrew, and Mesopotamia was reclaimed by the Sasanians. By the end of his reign, Bahram II had made peace with the Roman emperor Diocletian and put an end to the disturbances in Khuzestan and the east. \nIn the Caucasus, Bahram II strengthened Sasanian authority by securing the Iberian throne for Mirian III, an Iranian nobleman from the House of Mihran. Bahram II has been suggested by scholars to be the first Sasanian ruler to have coins minted of his family. He also ordered the carving of several rock reliefs that unambiguously emphasize distinguished representations of his family and members of the high nobility. He was succeeded by his son Bahram III, who after only four months of reign, was overthrown by Narseh, a son of the second Sasanian ruler, Shapur I (r.\u2009240\u2013270).", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "40_26", "question": "Who is Lou Scheimer's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_68450", "text": "In the mid-1950s, Scheimer was appointed to the position of art director while working at Larry Harmon Pictures on the made-for-TV Bozo and Popeye cartoons. He formed a close working relationship with former Disney animator Hal Sutherland, with he two later becoming business partners. Larry Harmon eventually closed the studio in 1961. Scheimer and Sutherland went to work at a small company called True Line. While working there, they were contracted by SIB Productions, a Japanese firm with U.S. offices in Chicago, who approached them about producing a cartoon called Rod Rocket. The two agreed to take on the work and also took on a project for Family Films, Life of Christ, a series of ten short animated films based on the life of Christ. Paramount Pictures soon purchased SIB Productions, and the contract allowed True Line to hire additional staff, such as former radio disc jockey Norm Prescott. Scheimer and Sutherland formed a close relationship with their new co-worker.\nIn 1962, Scheimer, Sutherland and Prescott eventually left True Line, and Scheimer began independently working on commercials. He figured that he could form his own company to produce animation. In September of that year, he, Sutherland and Ira Epstein, who had worked for Harmon but had left the firm, formed Filmation Associates. The company's name was invented because according to Scheimer, \"We were working on film, but doing animation.\" Prescott joined them soon after the company's formation, and the trio were the company's main producers. They immediately started work on Journey Back to Oz, an animated sequel to the MGM film The Wizard of Oz  and loosely based on the Oz series of books by L. Frank Baum. Due to financial problems, it took them about a decade to complete the film.\nIn the meantime, Filmation turned their attention to a more successful medium, network television. For the next few years they made television commercials and some other projects for other companies and made an unsuccessful pilot film for a Marx Brothers cartoon series. They also tried to develop an original series named The Adventures of Stanley Stoutheart (later renamed Yank and Doodle), but they were never able to sell it and almost closed down. That was until they were approached by DC Comics editor Mort Weisinger to do a cartoon based on Superman. Superman premiered on September 10, 1966, and was followed by several of the other DC superheroes, and then, in 1968, the first Archie Show. Both series greatly helped Filmation's popularity to increase into the 1970s, when it scored big with several of its series, such as Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids and Star Trek: The Animated Series. For Star Trek: The Animated Series, Scheimer won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment - Children's Series.Early in Filmation's history, Scheimer also contributed a number of guest or secondary voices for the various productions. Most notably, he provided the voice of Dumb Donald on Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. He was also the voice of Legal Eagle and the Brown Hornet's sidekick Stinger and the voice-over narrator during the opening credits of the majority of Filmation shows and cartoons. In Jason of Star Command and Space Academy, he was consistently heard as generic voices over intercoms. In the live-action series The Ghost Busters, which starred Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch with Bob Burns, he was the voice of Zero, the unseen boss of the main characters. Scheimer also provided the voices of Stubby on The New Adventures of Gilligan, N'kima on Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, Bat-Mite, the Bat-Computer and Clayface on The New Adventures of Batman, Mo on Space Sentinels, Spinner and Scarab on Tarzan and the Super 7's Web Woman, Dinny on Fabulous Funnies, Mighty Mouse on The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle, Tom Cat, Jerry Mouse, Spike, Tuffy, Slick Wolf and Barney Bear on The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show, the Olympian Computer on Sport Billy, Gremlin on The New Adventures of Flash Gordon, Bumper on Gilligan's Planet, and Tracy the Gorilla on Ghostbusters.\nThe Filmation studio had emerged as a leading company in television animation, but it was no longer an independent company. The studio was purchased by the TelePrompTer Corporation in 1969. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, through its Group W Productions division, acquired Filmation along with its purchase of TelePrompTer's cable and entertainment properties in 1981. Despite this, Scheimer continued leading the company. He played a significant role in the creation of the cartoons He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and BraveStarr. As well as the executive producer, he was also co-credited for the series' musical score under the pseudonym \"Erika Lane\" (which combined the names of his daughter Erika and son Lane). It had also been used as a character name on the 1967 Filmation series Fantastic Voyage. He became a voice actor for the show (as he had done for many of his company's previous productions), going under the pseudonym \"Erik Gunden\". The last name was taken from his father's original surname: \"Gundenscheimer\" (which was later shortened to Scheimer). The first name was Lou's middle name, which he was not given by his parents, but instead by his wife Jay, who felt that he should have one. Scheimer's contribution to the cast was, in fact, most notable as he voiced several supporting characters, including Orko (and other characters with a similar Smurfs-voice), Stratos, King Randor and others. The reason that Scheimer performed the voices for so many supporting characters was that the \"official\" voice actors were contracted to perform no more than three different voices per episode. Since there were usually only three regular cast members working on each show, Scheimer would fill in the rest of the male cast. This is also why his wife and daughter did various small parts in the first season of He-Man, with Erika Scheimer performing supporting female voices and occasional voice-acting for young boy characters. During the second season of He-Man, and all of She-Ra: Princess of Power, Erika received an onscreen credit as an actor and also directed the voice actors, and she and her father recorded the remaining voices on their own later, because he did not see himself as a \"proper\" actor and was ashamed of recording with the other voice actors due to severe budget restrictions. The pitch of his voice was often changed by using a \"harmonizer\", which could control the pitch without altering the speed of the sound. The animated series also pioneered a type of programming known as first-run syndication. Another first was the storyline being based on an action figure toy; before this time, FCC regulations had prohibited any type of children's programming being based on a toy. Scheimer transformed He-Man from a graphically violent version of Conan the Barbarian into a pro-social character, who imparted a life lesson to impressionable viewers in each episode.In 1989, Westinghouse decided to shut down Filmation and sell the studio's properties. Scheimer effectively went into retirement after the end of his studio. In the late 1990s, he returned to the field of animation. A Dutch investment company, Dreamweavers, NV., approached him with a concept based on an off-kilter Dutchman's renderings of characters aimed at young adults. Scheimer went into production on Robin and the Dreamweavers, an adult animated feature film. Robin, the first human to be born in cyberspace, battles Triple XXX: an evil siren who desires an earthly body, and who gains power through mankind's baser carnal desires. The movie, which has been compared to the majority of Ralph Bakshi's work, was never distributed. Scheimer also provided consultation work for Gang of Seven (G7) Animation.\nThe Lou Scheimer Gallery at the ToonSeum, a museum of comic and cartoon art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is named in his honor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This arose when once Artem Alikhanian asked Kapitsas' student Shalnikov \"is your supervisor a human or a beast?\" to which Shalnikov responded that he is a Centaurus, i.e. he can be human but also he can get angry and hit you with hooves like a horse. Kapitsa was married in 1927 to Anna Alekseyevna Krylova (1903-1996), daughter of applied mathematician Aleksey Krylov. They had two sons, Sergey and Andrey. Sergey Kapitsa (1928\u20132012) was a physicist and demographer.  Kapitsa was also the host of the popular and long-running Russian scientific TV show Evident, but Incredible. Andrey Kapitsa (1931\u20132011) was a geographer. He was credited with the discovery and naming of Lake Vostok, the largest subglacial lake in Antarctica, which lies 4,000 meters below the continent's ice cap.Kapitsa had the ear of people high up in the Soviet government, due to the usefulness to industry of his discoveries, regularly writing letters on matters of science policy. In particular, he saved both Vladimir Fock and Lev Landau from Stalin's purges of the 1930s, telling Vyacheslav Molotov that Landau was the only one who would be able to solve an important physics puzzle of the time.Kapitsa died on 8 April 1984 in Moscow at the age 89.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hyde did not know he had a sister until season 7. Angie graduated from college as a mathematics major. Angie and Hyde worked together managing their father's record store, but Angie did not always like working with him. She dated Kelso, which sometimes annoyed Hyde. Angie got her name because all season 7 episodes were named after Rolling Stones songs, and \"Angie\" was a song by the Stones.\nAnnette Berkardt (played by Jessica Simpson) was Kelso's girlfriend for a brief period of time in season 5. She acts and talks very similar to Jackie, constantly bossing Kelso around. Eric and Donna once referred to her as a blonde version of Jackie, or \"Blackie.\" Despite this, Jackie and Annette hated each other. Once at The Hub, Jackie said to Annette \"I did not know they let 'slutballs' in here\". Annette said since she saw Jackie in there she thought it was okay. Later in the episode, when Annette and Kelso were kissing, Jackie yelled \"Get off my boyfriend!\" to Annette, even though it was months after Kelso and Jackie broke up. This led to Hyde wanting to break up with Jackie. After Hyde and Jackie both reconciled and seeing Kelso is still not over Jackie, Annette decides to break up with Kelso and go back home to California.\nBeatrice \"Bea\" Sigurdson (played by Betty White) is Kitty's mother. Bea seems like a friendly old lady but is cold and critical, especially of Kitty. She appeared in a few episodes in season five, often nagging at Burt or saying something rude to Kitty in a faux-friendly manner. She was widowed in \"Your Time is Gonna Come\" when Burt collapses in the driveway and is rushed to the hospital where he dies. She shows little emotion after her husband's death but Kitty does catch her crying in a bedroom. Bea stays with the Formans for a while after Burt's death, causing Kitty considerable stress.  She is mentioned as being deceased by the time of the first episode of That 90s Show. In the seventh episode of That 90s Show, Kitty mentions that they spread Bea's ashes outside a Sizzler restaurant.\nBernice Forman (played by Marion Ross) is Red's mother. Bernice resented Kitty and was always mean to her. Kitty revealed it was because Red married her instead of an attractive and wealthy woman he once dated who Bernice liked. She appeared in the episodes \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\", \"The Best Christmas Ever\" and \"Grandma's Dead\" of season 1, and in a flashback in the episode \"Halloween\" of season two. In the episode \"Grandma's Dead\" she dies in Eric's car while he is driving her home after Eric tells her off for her treatment of his mother.\nBrooke Rockwell (played by Shannon Elizabeth) was the valedictorian of the high school class two years before Eric's class. The summer after Kelso's graduation, she had sex with him at a Molly Hatchet concert in a bathroom stall and got pregnant. Initially, Brooke did not trust Kelso because of his immaturity and did not want him in the child's life. Eventually, Kelso convinced her to give him another chance. Brooke gave birth to their daughter Betsy in 1979.\nBurt Sigurdson (played by Tom Poston) is Kitty's father. He is often seen avoiding his wife, Bea. In one episode, he bought an ostrich farm, which was right next to a coyote farm. The coyotes ate all the ostriches and the Sigurdsons had to sell the house.

He is later mentioned in the eighth episode of That 90s Show to have given Kitty beer when she was ten.\nCaroline \"Crazy Caroline\" Dupree (played by Allison Munn) was Fez's girlfriend in season 3. Fez quickly learned Caroline is very jealous and paranoid. She made threats against Donna and Jackie because Caroline felt they were going to steal Fez from her, when in fact Jackie and Donna had no intention of doing so. Caroline was once found hiding in the men's bathroom looking for Fez. Fez did not want to be with someone that aggressive and paranoid so he broke up with her. Fez and Caroline were together one last time in the eighth season. She got extremely angry when she found out that Fez had lied to her about Jackie being his roommate, and when she found nude photos of Donna in Fez's Barry White album (Leo hid the nude photos in the album without Fez's knowledge, but Caroline believed they were put there by Fez). Caroline appeared again in \"Sheer Heart Attack\". Fez was having sex with women once and not seeing them again and then decided that he wanted to be with only one woman, so he called Caroline. Later in the episode, Jackie told Fez that she loved him and then kissed him as Caroline walked in. This, as always, made Caroline angry with Fez and attack him viciously.\nCasey Kelso (played by Luke Wilson) is Kelso's brother who was in the military. Towards the end of season 4 he was dating Donna. During their relationship, there were instances of them engaging in bad behavior, such as Donna drinking and skipping school to hang out with Casey. Donna's father, Bob, felt that Casey was a bad influence and did not want Donna to date him anymore. Eric was jealous of Casey because he wanted to be with Donna, so Eric wanted them to break up. When Red, Kitty and Bob were discussing Casey's bad influence with Donna and Casey, Casey broke up with Donna, deciding the conflict with the adults to be too much hassle. Donna felt that she and Casey were in love, but Casey cruelly said \"I have this thing where I say stuff don't really mean.\" Kelso said that his brother got bored with his girlfriends and broke up with them. During the summer of 1979, Casey was teaching physical education at Eric's old high school, and Eric was in Casey's class. He likes to call Eric \"Foreplay\". His last appearance was in the Season 7 episode \"2120 So. Michigan Ave\". He is later mentioned in the season finale of That 90s Show when Donna tells Leia she dated him while broken up with Eric.\nCharlie Richardson (played by Bret Harrison) is the son of one of Red's war buddies. Eric held a grudge against him from the time that he let some sick children win \"Eric's\" goldfish in an egg toss. Charlie only appeared in about three episodes towards the end of season 7. Before the beginning of season 8, Charlie accidentally fell off the water tower and died. The water tower is named the Charlie Richardson Memorial Water Tower in his honor. The show originally planned to have Charlie stay the entire 8th season as a replacement for Eric, but killed Charlie off because Harrison got an offer to star in The Loop.\nChristine St. George (played by Mary Tyler Moore) is a talk show host of What's Up Wisconsin.

Earl later got a job working at a fast food restaurant, where he is again fired for his poor work ethic (this time for repeatedly eating the restaurant's food while at work). Earl appears in the episodes \"Red Fired Up\", \"Roller Disco\" and \"Radio Daze\".\nEdna Hyde (played by Katey Sagal) is Hyde's biological mother. She is in the season 1 episodes \"Career Day\", \"Prom Night\", and \"Punk Chick\", only appearing on-screen in \"Career Day\". She plays a large part in \"Career Day\" as the school chef \"Gross Edna\", playing opposite Hyde when he has to help her in the kitchen on Career Day. In other episodes she only has lines yelling at Hyde on the porch from the inside of the house such as:\nIn Prom Night Edna: \"They're all gonna laugh at you!\" (a prom night reference to the 1976 film, Carrie) Steven: \"Shut up ma, you're makin' the night too damn special!\"\nIn Punk Chick Steven: \"It's still my suitcase!\" Edna: \"Nothing in this house is yours!\" Steven: \"Shut up!\"Edna then ran off and abandoned Hyde, not heard of again until the 4th season where Hyde claims that she and his stepfather Bud got back together and ran off. After Hyde's abandonment, Kitty prevailed upon Red to let the squalor-ridden Hyde live with the Formans.Fenton (played by Jim Rash) is someone with whom Fez has a feud due to a \"half-off sale, a crowded parking lot and a pair of pants that made Fez's ass look like an oil painting\" (in Fez's own words). In the fifth season, he was an employee at the jewelry store where Eric bought Donna's engagement ring. He is also the landlord of the apartment that Fez and Kelso moved into in the seventh season, which later became Fez and Jackie's apartment when Kelso moved to Chicago. At first, Fenton did not want to let Kelso and Fez move in because of his feud with Fez, but later when he found out Kelso wanted the apartment to have a place to take care of his daughter, and Fenton got the impression that Kelso and Fez were \"life partners\", he let them have it. Though Fenton does not state this explicitly, his frequent innuendos about men, his lack of experience with women, his mannerisms and affect overtly imply that he is gay. Whenever he sees Fez, he says \"Oh, it's you\" in a contemptuous way. Neither Fenton nor Fez specifically explain the reason for their mutual hostility and dislike to Eric, despite his increasing curiosity. Fenton later becomes good friends with Jackie, who persuades him not to evict Fez and end their feud. However, very shortly thereafter she carelessly floods both their apartment and Fenton's apartment directly underneath after falling asleep while running the bathtub. He returns in the finale of That 90s Show, now Sherri's landlord, and reignites his rivalry with Fez. He also mentions that he now owns three houses, a duplex and a Dippin Dots. He is the only character who was not part of the main cast to make an appearance in That 90s Show.\nHilary Robinson (played by Lara Everly) is Fez's co-worker at the salon where Fez works in season 8.

She does not get along well with Red. When Red and Joanne first meet, they get into an argument about who would cook the meat and who would make the salad. Joanne works at the dog food factory and hires Eric to put coupons in the dog food bags. Eric eventually loses that job after Joanne breaks up with Bob.\nMitch Miller (played by Seth Green) is a student in the same class as Eric. Mitch has a feud with Fez and publishes a photo in the school newspaper of Fez and Kelso kissing each other. Mitch has a crush on Donna, and the two once went to a wedding. Eric is angered when Mitch embarrasses Donna, and Eric and Mitch agree to fight each other the next day at 5:15 PM. Not wanting to fight, Mitch persuades Eric not to fight by offering him a French-made GI Joe called \"GI Jacques\". Mitch has a father, Charlie Miller, played by Fred Willard.\nNina Bartell (played by Joanna Canton) is a girlfriend of Fez in season 5 who works with him at the DMV. Fez loses his virginity to her but it goes badly, so she suggests they need to do it more often to get better. It turns out that the reason she's dating Fez was to anger her parents due to him being \"different\", They break up a while later because Nina thinks he is too needy.\nOfficer Kennedy (played by James Avery) is Kelso's training officer when he joins the police force. He appears mostly in the 6th season, playing a straight ace to the bumbling Kelso.\nPam Burkhart (played by Eve Plumb in season 1 and Brooke Shields in season 6) is the mother of Jackie who was dating Bob Pinciotti in season 6. Once a serious business lady, she flees to Mexico when Jackie's councilman father is arrested for bribery and embezzling $60,000. She returns to try to fix her relationship with Jackie.\nPam Macy (played by Jennifer Lyons) is a classmate of the main characters of the show. She is mentioned in more episodes than she appears, mostly by Michael Kelso. She appears in the episodes \"Prom Night\", \"Romantic Weekend\", and \"It's a Wonderful life\". In \"Prom Night\", Michael takes Pam to the prom while temporarily broken up with Jackie. In \"Romantic Weekend\", Kelso is about to have sex with Pam but is unable to perform, telling his friends \"the buffer wouldn't buff.\" Pam tells the whole school, which causes everyone to tease Kelso.\nPastor Dave (played by Kevin McDonald), Pastor Dave is the local pastor at the church. He is overly cheerful and (incorrectly) thinks he is \"hip cand cool\", up to date with the trends. He is often greeted by Eric and his friends with deadpan voices, and they typically just agree with Dave in the hopes he'll go away. Dave is good friends with Kitty, who helps with the church fundraisers, and has an uneasy friendship with Red (mostly because Red is not used to having friends). His friendship with Red seems to have brought out a less-pure side of Dave, as he spends a day with Red watching football and drinking beer, and once even quit the church because he wanted to watch more football on Sundays (later rejoining as the pastor). He appears primarily in season 3 and 4, but has a few cameos in season 2.\nRhonda Tate (played by Cynthia Lamontagne) Often called \"Big Rhonda\" by her classmates, she is a recurring character during season 4 as Fez's girlfriend. When she and Fez are stuck in the school during a tornado they are about to have sex, but Rhonda changes her mind when the tornado ends. She breaks up with Fez after she chokes him after he wanted to get to third base, which came from bad advice from Casey Kelso. Like Fez, she loves candy. She treats Eric with relentless contempt but is genuinely fond of Fez. She also physically intimidated tiny Jackie by threatening to wrestle her after Jackie gets rude with her. The episode \"It's a Wonderful Life\" features an alternate timeline where Rhonda goes to the prom with Eric (in this timeline, Eric and Donna were never in a relationship), and they remain together until he dumps her. Eric mentions that the two only had sex three times. Later in the same episode she is seen at their 10-year reunion but now as a trim, beautiful, and sexy woman. Rhonda claims her new body came from being dumped by Eric, leading her to lose weight using Jane Fonda workout tapes before becoming a fitness instructor herself. She thanks him for this. It is also mentioned in the season 3 episode \"Kitty's Birthday\" that she was hit by a car but was apparently uninjured.\nRoy Keene (played by Jim Gaffigan) is the kitchen manager of the Holiday Hotel employing Eric, Hyde, and Kelso to work as waiters in the hotel's restaurant during seasons 5 and 6. The character serves as the replacement for Leo, who was written out during season 5. Hyde mentions that Roy is like a father figure since his father abandoned him. Roy has stated that his standards for food service are low, and he goes days without washing his hands. Roy served in the Vietnam War, once describing Eric as \"scrawny, but strong... like the Vietcong\". He suffers from serious trouble connecting to people. One time, he got the impression a woman was in love with him after she insulted him when he got her some butter, so he hid in her shower to surprise her with flowers. He once mentioned he was living with a woman but moved out when she found out he was living with her in secret. It is revealed in the season 6 episode \"A Legal Matter\" that he was a police cadet who was kicked out of the police academy for shooting a police horse.\nSamantha Hyde (played by Judy Tylor) is Hyde's wife during season 8. They got married while Hyde was drunk in Las Vegas. The two barely knew each other when they got married. Hyde did not even remember the wedding and did not know he was married until after Samantha came to Point Place to see Hyde. In the episode \"My Fairy King\", Hyde learned that Samantha was already married to someone else. After this, Hyde and Samantha's relationship ended.\nSchatzi is a Dachshund that Red gave Kitty in an attempt to make her happy. Schatzi was in several episodes of season 5, was absent for all of season 6, then returned for only one episode towards the beginning of season 7. Red claimed that his absence was due to hiding under the house because he was afraid of the garden hose. \"Schatzi\" is German and means \"little treasure\" or \"darling\" (diminutive of \"Schatz\"). In the eighth episode of That 90s Show, Kitty mentions that they don't have a dog anymore, confirming that Schatzi is either dead or no longer lives with the Formans.\nSteven James \"Bud\" Hyde Sr. (played by Robert Hays) is Hyde's stepfather. Bud Hyde worked as a bartender and is an alcoholic. Until the end of the 6th season, Hyde thought Bud was his biological father. Bud abandoned Hyde when he was a child and Steven was always angry at Bud for this. They temporarily reconciled in season 3, with Hyde even moving in with him. However, he would leave again at the beginning of season 4 after getting back together with Edna \u2013 forcing Hyde to move back to the Forman house. Hyde mentioned that Bud did attempt to get in touch with him again. (Bud was passed out drunk on Hyde's car.)\nSuzy Simpson (played by Alyson Hannigan) appears in two episodes of season 6. She is Kelso's buddy from the police academy who is also attracted to him. Fez has a crush on Suzy and it is because of her that he and Kelso fight after Kelso lies to Fez saying that Suzy has agreed to go on a date with him when really she thinks that she is dating Kelso. However, when Fez reveals that Kelso's having a Baby with another woman and Kelso reveals that Fez is married, she is furious and wants nothing to do with them.\nTimmy Thompson (played by Paul Connor) is an annoying fellow student in the gang who always embarrasses someone with loud comments meant for everyone around to hear, such as:\n\"Heeey, Forman and Donna got a motel room and they're going to do it!\"\n\"Heeey, I'm taking off my pants!\"\n\"Heeey, Forman's on a date with his mom!\"\n\"Heeey, Donna's showed her ass!\" (while showing everyone a yearbook photo where Donna mooned the camera).He only has real dialogue in the episode \"Burning Down The House\".William James \"WB\" Barnett (played by Tim Reid) is Hyde's biological father. Hyde originally thought Bud Hyde was his biological father until the cliffhanger between the 6th and 7th seasons, where Kitty discovers that Hyde's real father is a man who lives in Milwaukee. Sometimes people call Barnett by his initials, \"WB\". Barnett is wealthy and owns Grooves, a chain of record stores. Barnett put Hyde in charge of the Point Place record store along with his daughter (and Hyde's half sister), Angie. Barnett is an African American, which Hyde believes explains his \"coolness, afro and suspicion of The Man\" (it can also be noted that when Hyde asked him who killed Kennedy his father stated \"I don't know, because they don't want me to know\").

{"id": "40_30", "question": "Who is Yang Su's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_68468", "text": "In 581, Yang Jian had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui dynasty as its Emperor Wen.  Yang Su continued to serve in Emperor Wen's administration including a spell helping prepare the Kaihuang Code on which Emperor Wen's legal reforms were based.  In 584, during an argument with his wife Zheng Qiye (\u90d1\u7941\u8036), he angrily stated, \"If I become emperor, you will not be empress!\"  Zheng Qiye, in anger, reported the comment to Emperor Wen, who removed Yang Su from his post as a punishment.  In 585, Emperor Wen restored him and made him the commandant at Xin Province (modern eastern Chongqing) to prepare an attack against Chen down the Yangtze River.  While at Xin Province, he built large ships in anticipation of the attack.\nIn winter 588, Emperor Wen launched the attack, commissioning his sons Yang Guang the Prince of Jin and Yang Jun, along with Yang Su, to command the three main prongs of the attack, with Yang Guang in overall command of the operations.  Yang Su's responsibility was to take his forces down the Yangtze and attack cities on the river.  He passed through the Three Gorges and defeated the Chen general Qi Xin (\u621a\u6615).  He soon ran into heavy resistance by the Chen general L\u00fc Zhongsu (\u5442\u5fe0\u8085) and initially was repelled, but eventually was able to defeat L\u00fc.  With Chen Shubao's cousin Chen Huiji (\u9673\u6167\u7d00) abandoning the region to make one last-ditch attempt to reach the Chen capital Jiankang to help defend it against Yang Guang's attack, Yang Su encountered no further resistance, and soon news that Jiankang had fallen arrived, and the local provinces all surrendered to him or Yang Jun, whom he met at Hankou (\u6f22\u53e3 in modern Wuhan, Hubei).  Emperor Wen subsequently promoted Yang Su to the greater title of Duke of Yue and transferred his title of Duke of Qinghe to his son Yang Xuanjiang (\u694a\u7384\u734e), while making his heir apparent Yang Xuangan a mid-level official.  He was briefly made the commandant at Jing Province (\u834a\u5dde roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei), but in summer 588 was recalled to the capital to be the head of the examination bureau (\u9580\u4e0b\u7701 Menxia Sheng) -- one of the most important officials in the imperial government.  In 590, he was made the head of the legislative bureau (\u5167\u53f2\u7701 Neishi Sheng).\nLater in 590, with Chen's former territory up in rebellions against imposition of Sui laws, Yang Su was put in command of a large army to attack the various rebel leaders.  He defeated Shen Xuanhui (\u6c88\u7384\u61c0) and Gao Zhihui (\u9ad8\u667a\u6167), eventually quelling much of the former Chen territory.  Emperor Wen awarded him with many gifts.  Based on Yang Su's conduct during the campaign, the historian Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, commented:\n\nWhen Yang Su commanded large armies, he showed flexibility and much tactical capability.  His military discipline was harsh, and before each battle, he always sought out soldiers who had faults to execute in order to show his power -- sometimes more than a hundred, and sometimes no less than 20.  As their blood flowed before him, he treated as if it were nothing, and continued to smile and talk.  When it came time for battling, he would send out somewhere between 100 to 200 soldiers as a forward corps to attack first.  If they were unsuccessful in penetrating the enemy lines and returned, regardless of how many survived, they would all be executed.  He would then repeat the process, but with 200 to 300 soldiers.  All officers and soldiers tremored with fear, and all fought with resolution to fight to the death.  Therefore, he was always victorious and considered a great general.  At that time, Yang Su was powerful and favored by the emperor.  Whatever he suggested was not refused, and so Yang Su's followers, even if their contributions were small, would be rewarded for their contributions.  The soldiers under the other generals often had their contributions denied by the civilian officials and not rewarded.  Therefore, even though Yang Su was cruel, his soldiers were willing to follow him.Around the new year 593, Yang Su was made a co-head of the executive bureau (\u5c1a\u66f8\u7701 Shangshu Sheng) with Gao Jiong, effectively serving as co-prime ministers, replacing Su Wei in that role.  It was said that by this point, Yang Su had become very arrogant, and among the officials, he only respected Gao, Niu Hong (\u725b\u5f18), and Xue Daoheng (\u859b\u9053\u8861), looking down at and bullying the rest.  It was commented by traditional historians that he was more talented and had more foresight than Gao, but that he was not as fair-minded or well-behaved as Gao.\nIn spring 593, Emperor Wen commissioned Yang Su to oversee the building of his vacation palace, Renshou Palace (\u4ec1\u58fd\u5bae in modern Baoji, Shaanxi).  Yang Su spent much effort building it to be a luxurious palace, needing not much architectural work but landscaping of the nearby hills and valleys.  Much human life was lost\u2014numbering in the tens of thousands.  The palace was completed in spring 595, and when Emperor Wen inspected it, he, by nature frugal, was initially displeased and stated, \"Yang Su expended money and effort to build this palace, and he made the people hate me.\"  Yang Su was fearful of punishment, but when Emperor Wen's wife Empress Dugu arrived, she pointed out to Emperor Wen that Yang Su knew that they had little other pleasures, and therefore built the palace in this manner.  She gave Yang Su awards in both money and silk.\nIn 598, both Empress Dugu and Yang Su's wife Zheng Qiye were ill, and suspicions came on the official Dugu Tuo (\u7368\u5b64\u9640)--who was Empress Dugu's half-brother and whose wife was Yang Su's half-sister.  Dugu Tuo was accused of having his servant girl Xu Ani (\u5f90\u963f\u5c3c) employ cat spirits to curse Empress Dugu and Zheng Qiye, and was nearly executed, but at Empress Dugu's urging was spared and only reduced to commoner rank.\nIn spring 599, Yang Su was one of the major generals commissioned to attack Tujue's Dulan Khan, Ashina Yongyul\u00fc, along with Gao Jiong and Yan Rong (\u71d5\u69ae).  He encountered Ashina Yongyul\u00fc's subordinate khan, the Datou Khan Ashina Dianjue.  Contrary to prior strategies to first protect his army before engaging, he quickly engaged Ashina Dianjue and defeated him, forcing Ashina Dianjue to flee.\nSometime around that time, Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu, who generally had a loving relationship, had a major conflict\u2014over an affair by Emperor Wen (who otherwise did not have any concubines, in contrast with nearly every other emperor in Chinese history) with Yuchi Jiong's granddaughter, who had become a servant in the palace.  Empress Dugu killed Lady Yuchi, and in anger, Emperor Wen rode away from the palace.  Yang Su and Gao had to track him down and persuade him back to the palace.  Yang Su and Gao subsequently held a banquet for them to allow them to reconcile.\nIn winter 599, Emperor Wen sent Yang Su again to attack Ashina Yongyul\u00fc, but before his army could depart, Ashina Yongyul\u00fc was assassinated and replaced by Ashina Dianjue (as Bujia Khan), and so Yang Su did not launch his army.  In 600, when Ashina Dianjue attacked, Emperor Wen sent Yang Su and Shi Wansui (\u53f2\u842c\u6b72), along with his sons Yang Guang and Yang Liang, to resist, and Ashina Dianjue was fought off.  (The historians had much to say as to Shi's success during this campaign, but not Yang Su's, suggesting that Yang Su was not involved in major engagements during this campaign.)\nBy 600, Emperor Wen's crown prince Yang Yong had lost the favor of Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu, over his wastefulness (which displeased Emperor Wen) and having many concubines (which displeased Empress Dugu).  Yang Guang, whom Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu, had for some time plotted to replace Yang Yong, sent his associate Yuwen Shu to persuade Yang Su's brother Yang Yu\u0113 that, as Yang Su did not have a good relationship with Yang Yong, that if Emperor Wen died, Yang Su and his brothers would soon be in danger under Yang Yong's rule.  Rather, Yuwen suggested, Yang Su should form a pact with Yang Guang and try to have Yang Guang made crown prince.  Yang Su agreed, and began to discuss with Empress Dugu in earnest the possibility of replacing Yang Yong with Yang Guang.  Empress Dugu was pleased, and requested Yang Su to persuade Emperor Wen as well.  By fall 600, Yang Guang had Yang Yong's associate Ji Wei (\u59ec\u5a01) falsely accuse Yang Yong of plotting treason.  Emperor Wen commissioned Yang Su to investigate, and Yang Su intentionally misinterpreted evidence and manufactured additional evidence, causing Emperor Wen to believe that Yang Yong was indeed plotting treason.  Emperor Wen deposed Yang Yong and created Yang Guang crown prince instead.\nIn winter 601, Emperor Wen commissioned Yang Su to command an army, in association with Qimin Khan Ashina Rangan (who had surrendered to Sui and whom Emperor Wen had created khan), to attack Ashina Dianjue.  In spring 602, Yang Su achieved a great victory, and for his victory, Yang Xuangan's post was upgraded, and another son of Yang Su, Yang Xuanzong (\u694a\u7384\u7e31), was created the Duke of Huainan.\nBy 602, Yang Guang was concerned that his brother, Yang Xiu the Prince of Shu, who as the commandant at Yi Province (roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan) was in control of the modern Sichuan and Chongqing region, would eventually make trouble for him.  He had Yang Su collect evidence of Yang Xiu's wastefulness and inappropriate behavior.  Emperor Wen summoned Yang Xiu back to the capital, and had Yang Su investigate.  Both Yang Guang and Yang Su manufactured additional evidence against Yang Xiu, and Yang Xiu was reduced to commoner rank and put under house arrest.\nAlso in 602, Empress Dugu died.  Yang Su was in charge of the funeral arrangements, and in appreciation, Emperor Wen created yet another son of Yang Su the Duke of Yikang.  Upon accusations by the official Liang Pi (\u6881\u6bd7) that Yang Su was becoming overly powerful and abusive, Emperor Wen began to distance himself from Yang Su, although he continued to confer honors on Yang Su.  The actual authority over the executive bureau was instead exercised by Su Wei and Emperor Wen's son-in-law Liu Shu (\u67f3\u8ff0).\nIn summer 604, while at Renshou Palace, Emperor Wen became ill.  Yang Su, Liu, and Yuan Yan (\u5143\u513c) attended to him.  Emperor Wen soon died, and Yang Guang, after ordering Yang Su's brother Yang Yu\u0113 to have Yang Yong killed, announced Emperor Wen's death and took the throne as Emperor Yang.\nTraditional historians, while admitting a lack of direct evidence, largely believed an account that Emperor Wen's death was a murder ordered by Yang Guang, with Yang Su in cooperation.  This account alleged that Yang Guang attempted to rape Emperor Wen's concubine Consort Chen (Chen Shubao's sister), and when Consort Chen reported the attempted rape to Emperor Wen, Emperor Wen tried to depose Yang Guang and sent Liu and Yuan to summon Yang Yong. Yang Su arrested Liu and Yuan, and then Yang Guang sent his associate Zhang Heng (\u5f35\u8861) to kill Emperor Wen.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The idea of the colegiado system remained influential, however, and was reintroduced with the 1952 Constitution of Uruguay in the form of the National Council of Government. The National Council of Government fully abolished the presidency, making it closer to Batlle's desired system, but was itself abolished for a second time and the presidency re-established by the 1967 constitution.In addition to his reforms, Batlle also succeeded in moving his Colorado Party in a more progressive direction, with one study arguing that\n\"The revitalization of the Colorado party was one of the early accomplishments of the great Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. Sterility, a creeping cynicism, the incubus of the military dictatorships of recent years, all combined to put the Colorado party in almost as unenviable a position as that occupied by the Blancos. Batlle sold his party on its need for idealism and a program of reform, on the importance of intra-party democracy, discipline, and cohesiveness. The Colorado program, as Batlle thus evolved it, might have been a Latin archetype for the pattern of the New Deal in the United States a generation later.\"According to one source, Batlle was responsible \"for directing the liberal, democratic-independence institutional reform of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, which placed her at the head of progressive and justice achievements; and gave him great fame in the American concert.\"A public park and a neighborhood in Montevideo are named after him.\nThere is also a town in Lavalleja Department named after him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is famous for his involvement in the creation of Ry\u014dan-ji, a temple famous for its rock garden, and for his involvement in the \u014cnin War, which sparked the 130-year Sengoku period. His childhood name was Sumiakamaru (\u8061\u660e\u4e38).\nHis conflicts with his father-in-law, Yamana S\u014dzen, who resented the power Hosokawa had as Kanrei,  were among those that ignited the \u014cnin War in 1467. When the Sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa had a son in 1464, Yamana took this as an opportunity to oppose Hosokawa further, supporting the child as heir to the Shogunate. Hosokawa had always worked closely with the Sh\u014dgun's brother Ashikaga Yoshimi and supported his claim to the shogunate.In 1467, open war broke out in the capital of Kyoto, between Hosokawa and Yamana, who each commanded roughly 80,000 men. The Sh\u014dgun declared that the first to make war in the capital would be branded a rebel, and so the two armies remained immobile for some time, but within a few months, the tensions had risen too far, and war simply could not be delayed any further. Hosokawa made the first obvious attack within the capital, attacking the mansion of a Yamana general by the name of Isshiki. Fighting erupted between the two camps, and over the course of the next few days, many were killed, and many buildings destroyed, either by the soldiers or by looters. Each army gradually carved out a section of the city that they held and defended against the other; Hosokawa's army came to be known as the Eastern Army, as Yamana's so-called \"Western Army\" controlled western sections of Kyoto. But not all the fighting took place within the city; Hosokawa sent men onto the main roads, and into Yamana's home provinces, to prevent his reinforcements from reaching the main battles.Though Hosokawa attacked first, he convinced the Sh\u014dgun to brand Yamana, not himself, with the stigma of being a rebel against the Shogunate. He even persuaded Yoshimasa to make him the general of the official Shogunal attacks on Yamana but failed to grant him any tangible support. Some of Yamana's followers deserted, joining Hosokawa's morally superior side, but many more switched sides as a result of the work of Hosokawa's emissaries to the provinces where Yamana and his allies drew their armies.By New Year's of 1468, nearly a year after the war began, the fighting tapered off. For much of that year, the two forces engaged in glaring contests and limited sorties, both desiring to rebuild and to act only defensively. Both spent the next several years in political, not military, conflict, and in 1469, the Sh\u014dgun named his son Yoshihisa, his heir. But Hosokawa was weary of battle and wished for peace.

Twice Hesiod calls Oceanus \"the perfect river\" (\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bf), and Homer refers to the \"stream of the river Oceanus\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bf \u03bb\u03af\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd \u1fe5\u03cc\u03bf\u03bd \u1f68\u03ba\u03b5\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bf). Both Hesiod and Homer call Oceanus \"backflowing\" (\u1f00\u03c8\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03cc\u03bf\u03c5), since, as the great stream encircles the earth, it flows back into itself. Hesiod also calls Oceanus \"deep-swirling\" (\u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03c5\u03b4\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2), while Homer calls him \"deep-flowing\" (\u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03c5\u03c1\u03c1\u03cc\u03bf\u03c5). Homer says that Oceanus \"bounds the Earth\", and Oceanus was depicted on the shield of Achilles, encircling its rim, and so also on the shield of Heracles.Both Hesiod and Homer locate Oceanus at the ends of the earth, near Tartarus, in the Theogony, or near Elysium, in the Iliad, and in the Odyssey, has to be crossed in order to reach the \"dank house of Hades\". And for both Hesiod and Homer, Oceanus seems to have marked a boundary beyond which the cosmos became more fantastical. The Theogony has such fabulous creatures as the Hesperides, with their golden apples, the three-headed giant Geryon, and the snake-haired Gorgons, all residing \"beyond glorious Ocean\". While Homer located such exotic tribes as the Cimmerians, the Aethiopians, and the Pygmies as living nearby Oceanus.In Homer, Helios the sun, rises from Oceanus in the east, and at the end of the day sinks back into Oceanus in the west, and the stars bathe in the \"stream of Ocean\". According to later sources, after setting, Helios sails back along Oceanus during the night from west to east.Just as Oceanus the god was the father of the river gods, Oceanus the river was said to be the source of all other rivers,  and in fact all sources of water, both salt and fresh. According to Homer, from Oceanus \"all rivers flow and every sea, and all the springs and deep wells\". Being the source of rivers and springs would seem logically to require that Oceanus was himself a freshwater river, and so different from the salt sea, and in fact Hesiod seems to distinguish between Oceanus and Pontus, the personification of the sea. However elsewhere the distinction between fresh and salt water seems not to apply. For example, in Hesiod Nereus and Thaumus, both sons of Pontus, marry daughters of Oceanus, and in Homer (who makes no mention of Pontus), Thetis, the daughter of Nereus, and Eurynome the daughter of Oceanus, live together. In any case, Oceanus can also to be identified with the sea.The concept of the surrounding Ocean, as expressed by Homer and Hesiod, remained in common use throughout antiquity.  The Roman geographer Pomponius Mela  said that the inhabited earth \u2018is entirely surrounded by the Ocean, from which it receives four seas\u2019 .  These four seas were the Caspian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Gulf, and the Mediterranean Sea.  However increasing knowledge of the seas led to modifications in this view. The Greek geographer Ptolemy identified various different oceans . One of these, the Western Ocean (the Atlantic Ocean) was often called simply \u2018the Ocean\u2019, for instance by Julius Caesar .", "hasanswer": false}]}

Other family members are Gang-du's daughter, Hyun-seo; his sister Nam-joo, a national medalist archer; and his brother, Nam-il, an alcoholic college graduate and former political activist.\nA huge creature emerges from the Han River and begins attacking people leaving many of them dead. Gang-du tries to grab his daughter from the crowd and run, but he realizes he has grabbed the wrong person's hand and sees the creature snatching away Hyun-seo and diving back into the river. After a mass funeral for the victims, government representatives and the American military arrive and quarantine people who had contact with the creature, including Gang-du and his family. It is announced that the creature is the host of a deadly, unknown virus.\nGang-du receives a phone call from Hyun-seo. She explains that she is trapped in the sewers with the creature, but her phone stops working. Gang-du and his family escape the hospital and purchase supplies from gangsters in order to search for Hyun-seo. Two homeless boys, Se-jin and Se-joo, after raiding Hee-bong's snack bar for food, are attacked and swallowed by the creature. It returns to its sleeping area in the sewer and regurgitates them, but only Se-joo is alive. Hyun-seo helps Se-joo hide inside a drain pipe where the creature cannot reach them.\nThe Parks encounter the creature and shoot at it until they run out of ammunition. The creature kills Hee-bong due to Gang-du miscalculating the remaining shells in his shotgun when he gives it to Hee-bong. Gang-du is captured by the Army and Nam-il and Nam-joo become separated from each other. Nam-il meets an old friend, Fat Guevara, at an office building to ask for help and learns the government has placed a bounty on his family. Unbeknownst to Nam-il, Fat Guevara has contacted the government so he can claim the bounty, but Nam-il is able to escape after obtaining Hyun-seo's location. Gang-du overhears an American scientist say that there is no virus; it was made up to distract people from the creature's origin. They decided to lobotomize Gang-du to silence him.\nWhen she thinks the creature is sleeping, Hyun-seo tries to escape from its lair using a rope she has made from old clothes. The creature awakes and swallows Hyun-seo and Se-joo. Gang-du succeeds in escaping from where he is being held by taking a nurse hostage. Nam-il meets a homeless man who helps him. The government announces a plan to release a toxic chemical called Agent Yellow into the river to attempt to kill the creature. Gang-du finds the creature and sees Hyun-seo's arm dangling out of its mouth. He chases it to the location where Agent Yellow is to be released, coming across Nam-joo along the way. The creature attacks the large crowd that has assembled to protest the chemical dump. Agent Yellow is released, which stuns the creature. Gang-du pulls Hyun-seo out of its mouth, but she is dead, though she is still clutching Se-joo, who is unconscious, but alive. Gang-du, enraged at his daughter's death, attacks the creature, aided by Nam-il, Nam-joo, and the homeless man. They set it on fire and Gang-du impales it with a pole, finally killing it. As they mourn for Hyun-seo, Gang-du revives Se-joo.\nSome time later, it is seen that Gang-du has inherited his father's snack bar and adopted Se-joo.

When Alexander assumed full ruling powers, Bezhan's son and successor Otia defied him and his pro-Turkish policy, and attempted to remove Alexander from the throne. Alexander managed to force him into submission in 1732 and brought, for the time being, a feudal anarchy to an end.\nIn the early 1730s, the king effectively withdrew his loyalty from the Ottomans, refused to accept the Persian suzerainty and attempted to make an alliance with the Russian Empire. In 1738, he sent Bishop Timothy Gabashvili to St. Petersburg with a plan of joint actions against the Ottomans. However, the 1739 Russo-Turkish Treaty of Belgrade rendered the mission abortive. Indignant at his diplomacy in Russia, the Ottomans sponsored a coup that deposed Alexander in favor of his brother George IX.

He was the first Russian monarch to be crowned as tsar.\nIvan IV was the eldest son of Vasili III by his second wife Elena Glinskaya, and a grandson of Ivan III and Sophia Palaiologina. He succeeded his father after his death, when he was three years old. A group of reformers united around the young Ivan, crowning him the tsar of all Russia in 1547 at the age of 16. Ivan's reign was characterised by Russia's transformation from a medieval state to an empire under a tsar, but at an immense cost to its people, and long-term economy.\nIn the early years of his reign, Ivan ruled with the group of reformers known as the Chosen Council and established the Zemsky Sobor, a new assembly convened by the tsar. He also revised the legal code and introduced reforms, including elements of local self-government, as well as establishing the first Russian standing army, the streltsy. Ivan conquered the khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan, and significantly expanded the territory of Russia.\nAfter he had consolidated his power, Ivan rid himself of the advisers from the Chosen Council and triggered the Livonian War, which ravaged Russia and resulted in failure to take control over Livonia and the loss of Ingria, but allowed him to establish greater autocratic control over the Russian nobility, which he violently purged using Russia's first political police, the oprichniki. The later years of Ivan's reign were marked by the massacre of Novgorod and the burning of Moscow by the Tatars.\nIvan pursued cultural improvements, such as importing the first printing press to Russia. He also began several processes that would continue for centuries, including deepening connections with other European states, particularly England, fighting wars against the Ottoman Empire, and the gradual conquest of Siberia.\nContemporary sources present disparate accounts of Ivan's complex personality.

Historians generally believe that in a fit of anger, he murdered his eldest son and heir, Ivan Ivanovich; he might also have caused the miscarriage of the latter's unborn child.

In 1812 Donald and his family left Scotland to join Selkirk's Red River Settlement, in what became Manitoba, Canada. There they struggled to survive in an inhospitable land surrounded by conflict (between the HBC, NWC, fur traders and native factions). Alexander McLean was killed at the Battle of Seven Oaks on June 19, 1816, and what remained of the original settler's disbanded. Donald, his siblings and his mother returned to Scotland.\nHe joined the Hudson's Bay Company in 1833 as an apprentice clerk in the company's Western Department. In 1835 he was with expeditions to the Snake River country west of the Rockies led by Thomas McKay and John McLeod.  He was assigned to Fort Colville, under Chief Trader Archibald McDonald in 1839, and in 1840 was transferred to Flathead Post. Two years later, he was sent to the New Caledonia Fur District in now north-central British Columbia, and was, at different times, in charge of Forts Chilcotin, Babine, and McLeod. He also worked at Fort Alexandria under Donald Manson.\nMcLean was appointed Chief Trader in 1853, taking charge of Thompson's River Post (today's Kamloops) in 1855, expanding its cattle and horse herds and managing unruly relations with indigenous peoples sternly, acquiring a reputation both for fairness and severity.  It was during McLean's rule of the post that the first finds of gold were brought into the fort by local native peoples. The news which was carefully guarded, but eventually touched off the Fraser River Gold Rush.\nMcLean was known as \"Samadlin\" to his indigenous customers and friends, which is a corruption of Sieur McLean, which is how he was addressed by his French-Canadian underlings at the fur posts..  McLean's brutal practices - he was an adherent of an informal company policy known as \"Club Law\" - and various insubordinations led to him being called to company regional headquarters in Victoria in 1860 and ultimately to his resignation in 1861.\nDuring his tenure at Thompson's River Post, McLean had established a ranch in the hills northwest of Cache Creek. He now moved there with his family, ranching, prospecting, and running a roadhouse on the Cariboo Road at Lower Hat Creek (now a heritage museum and visitor attraction).\nMcLean came out of retirement during the Chilcotin War of 1864 to assist in the hunt for Chief Klattasine.

Klattasine lured McLean away from the camp near Choelquoit Lake. On July 17, 1864, as McLean opened his steel mesh vest to cool off Nezunlhtsin, a Tsilhqot'in warrior, shot and killed him.

{"id": "40_66", "question": "Who is Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_68603", "text": "Mohammad Reza inherited the wealth built by his father Reza Shah who preceded him as king of Iran and became known as the richest person in Iran during his reign, with his wealth estimated to be higher than 600 million rials[340] and including vast amounts of land and numerous large estates especially in the province of Mazandaran[341] obtained usually at a fraction of their real price. Reza Shah, facing criticism for his wealth, decided to pass on all of his land and wealth to his eldest son Mohammad Reza in exchange for a sugar cube, known in Iran as habbe kardan. However, shortly after obtaining the wealth Mohammad Reza was ordered by his father and then king to transfer a million toman ($500,000) to each of his siblings. By 1958, it was estimated that the companies possessed by Mohammad Reza had a value of $157 million (in 1958 USD) with an estimated additional $100 million saved outside Iran. Rumours of his and his family's corruption began to surface which greatly damaged his reputation. This formed one of the reasons for the creation of the Pahlavi Foundation and the distribution of additional land to the people of some 2,000 villages inherited by his father, often at very low and discounted prices. In 1958, using funds from inherited crown estates, Mohammad Reza established the Pahlavi Foundation which functioned as a tax-exempt charity and held all his assets, including 830 villages spanning a total area of 2.5 million hectares. According to Business Insider, Mohammad Reza had set up the organisation \"to pursue Iran's charitable interests in the U.S.\" At its height, the organisation was estimated to be worth $3 billion; however, on numerous occasions, the Pahlavi Foundation was accused of corruption. Despite these charges, in his book Answer to History, Pahlavi affirms that he \"never made the slightest profit\" out of the Foundation.In a 1974 interview which was shown in a documentary titled Crisis in Iran, Mohammad Reza told Mike Wallace that the rumours of corruption were \"the most unjust thing that I have heard,\" calling them a \"cheap accusation\" whilst arguing the allegations were not as serious as those regarding other governments, including that of the United States. In November 1978, after Pahlavi dismissed Prime Minister Jafar Sharif-Emami and appointed a military government, he pledged in a televised address \"not to repeat the past mistakes and illegalities, the cruelty and corruption.\" Despite this, the royal family's wealth can be seen as one of the factors behind the Iranian revolution. This was due to the oil crises of the 1970s which increased inflation resulting in economic austerity measures which made lower class workers more inclined to protest.Mohammad Reza's wealth remained considerable during his time in exile. While staying in the Bahamas he offered to purchase the island that he was staying on for $425 million (in 1979 USD); however, his offer was rejected by the Bahamas which claimed that the island was worth far more. On 17 October 1979, again in exile and perhaps knowing the gravity of his illness, he split up his wealth amongst his family members, giving 20% to Farah, 20% to his eldest son Reza, 15% to Farahnaz, 15% to Leila, 20% to his younger son, in addition to giving 8% to Shahnaz and 2% to his granddaughter Mahnaz Zahedi.\nOn 14 January 1979, an article titled \"Little pain expected in exile for Shah\" by The Spokesman Review newspaper found that the Pahlavi dynasty had amassed one of the largest private fortunes in the world; estimated then at well over $1 billion. It also stated that a document submitted to the ministry of justice, in protest of the royal family's activity in many sectors of the nation's economy, detailed the Pahlavis dominating role in the economy of Iran. The list showed that the Pahlavi dynasty had interests in, amongst other things, 17 banks and insurance companies, including a 90 per cent ownership in the nation's third-largest insurance company, 25 metal enterprises, 8 mining companies, 10 building materials companies, including 25 per cent of the largest cement company, 45 construction companies, 43 food companies, and 26 enterprises in trade or commerce, including a share of ownership in almost every major hotel in Iran; the Pahlavis also had major interests in real estate. Mohammad Reza was also known for his interest in cars and had a personal collection of 140 classic and sports cars including a Mercedes-Benz 500K Autobahn cruiser, one of only six ever made. The first Maserati 5000 GT was named the Shah of Persia, it was built for Mohammad Reza, who had been impressed by the Maserati 3500 and requested Giulio Alfieri, Maserati's chief engineer, to use a modified 5-litre engine from the Maserati 450S on the 3500GT's chassis.

He was the son of the hypatus John I, who made him co-ruler in 906 or thereabouts.\nDocibilis took part in the Battle of Garigliano in 915. In 930, he began adding the title of duke (dux), to his title of hypatus.  This was meant to signify a new status or rank, though the Byzantine Empire, to which he was always legally a vassal, always recognised him merely as archon (\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd). His father died in 933 or 934, and he subsequently became sole ruler.  At that juncture, he began asserting his independence from the Byzantines.  He abandoned the imperial dating by which charters were dated by the year of the emperor's reign and allied with Theobald I of Spoleto against the Greeks.\nLikewise, his wife Orania took the title of duchess, ducissa, alongside hypatissa, and he associated his son, John II, with him in the dukedom. In 939 he removed the style hypatus and began calling himself consul. He married his daughter Maria to the prince of Capua, to strengthen his ties to the rest of the local Italian nobility. Atenulf Megalu, the gastald of Aquino, fled to Docibilis' protection, but none of this bettered his relations with the Lombard princes: he was attacked by Landulf I of Benevento and lost some territory. Later on, he even imprisoned the abbot of Monte Cassino and was not above allying with the Saracens against which he had once fought. He was succeeded by his son John and later Gregory, and he gave Fondi to his son Marinus, with the title of dux, effectively splitting the duchy of Gaeta in two parts. His other son Leo received the Church of San Erasmo at Formia from John II and Docibilis left many daughters besides Maria: Anna, Gemma, Drosu, and Megalu.\nHe died after 954 and before 957.  In his last will (954) his palace in Gaeta, now in ruins, was described as having \"rooms, corridors, baths, aviaries, kitchens and courtyards down to the sea.\"", "hasanswer": true}]}

In August 1719, he returned with a detachment of Turkish auxiliaries, deposed George VIII Gurieli in June 1720, and was crowned king of Imereti. However, from 1721 to 1728, the government was effectively run by Bezhan Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia. When Alexander assumed full ruling powers, Bezhan's son and successor Otia defied him and his pro-Turkish policy, and attempted to remove Alexander from the throne. Alexander managed to force him into submission in 1732 and brought, for the time being, a feudal anarchy to an end.\nIn the early 1730s, the king effectively withdrew his loyalty from the Ottomans, refused to accept the Persian suzerainty and attempted to make an alliance with the Russian Empire. In 1738, he sent Bishop Timothy Gabashvili to St. Petersburg with a plan of joint actions against the Ottomans. However, the 1739 Russo-Turkish Treaty of Belgrade rendered the mission abortive. Indignant at his diplomacy in Russia, the Ottomans sponsored a coup that deposed Alexander in favor of his brother George IX. The Persian ruler Nadir Shah quickly took Alexander's side and protested to the Ottoman government. In 1742, Alexander was restored, but faced a revolt, in 1746, by his brother Mamuka who ruled as a rival king in parts of Imereti until the fratricide war ended in Alexander's victory in 1749.

At the age of 14, he was appointed the Archdeacon at Tribsees.  But in 1393 he left the clergy to marry.  According to later tradition, he made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land to obtain the required dispensation. He possibly started this pilgrimage together with his cousin Wartislaw VII of Pomerania-Stolp, who had to break off the journey due to illness.After the death of his father, Wartislaw VI, in 1394, Wartislaw VIII ruled Pomerania-Wolgast jointly with his elder brother Barnim VI.  During their joint reign, they sometimes joined the Hanseatic League in the fight against the piracy.  Sometimes, however, Duke Barnim VI himself operated as a pirate, leading to a tense relationship with the Hanseatic League and the Teutonic Knights.  Barnim VI died in 1405.\nAfter his brother's death, Wartislaw VIII ruled Pomerania-Wolgast alone, and acted as guardian for his brother's two sons Wartislaw IX (born: 1400) and Barnim VII (born: c.\u20091404).  He settled his dispute with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights in March 1406 and undertook a pilgrimage to Rome, where Pope Gregory XII gave him a Golden Rose.  After his return, Wartislaw gave the Golden Rose to the Pudagla Monastery, where it was soon revered as miraculous.  It was later destroyed by abbott Henry, who ruled 1479\u20131493, because it had become an idol.During his reign, there was an incident in Stralsund, known as the Papenbrand thom Sunde.

Wartislaw mediated an atonement in 1409, but could not settle the issue permanently.\nIn the struggle between the Dukes of Pomerania-Stettin, i.e. Swantibor III and later his sons Otto II and Casimir V against Elector Frederick I of the Mark Brandenburg, Wartislaw sided with the latter.  In 1413, he concluded an alliance with Frederick and Wartislaw's oldest son, also named Wartislaw, was engaged to Frederick's daughter Margaret.  However, Wartislaw junior died one or two years later, before he could marry Margaret.  Wartislaw VIII and Frederick travelled together to the Council of Constance, where Emperor Sigismund invested Wartislaw as Duke of Pomerania.  However, Wartislaw then had to travel back to Pomerania to deal with riots and could not participate with the council, such as the burning of the heretic John Huss.\nDuke Wartislaw VIII died on 20 August 1415.

{"id": "40_80", "question": "Who is Izyaslav of Polotsk's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "26_49253", "text": "The early years of Yaroslav's life are mostly unknown. He was one of the numerous sons of Vladimir the Great, presumably his second by Rogneda of Polotsk, although his actual age (as stated in the Primary Chronicle and corroborated by the examination of his skeleton in the 1930s) would place him among the youngest children of Vladimir.It has been suggested that he was a child begotten out of wedlock after Vladimir's divorce from Rogneda and marriage to Anna Porphyrogenita, or even that he was a child of Anna Porphyrogenita herself. French historian Jean-Pierre Arrignon argues that he was indeed Anna's son, as this would explain his interference in Byzantine affairs in 1043.Furthermore, Yaroslav's maternity by Rogneda of Polotsk has been questioned by Mykola Kostomarov in the 19th century. Yaroslav figures prominently in the Norse sagas under the name Jarisleif the Lame; his legendary lameness (probably resulting from an arrow wound) was corroborated by the scientists who examined his remains.In his youth, Yaroslav was sent by his father to rule the northern lands around Rostov. He was transferred to Veliky Novgorod, as befitted a senior heir to the throne, in 1010. While living there, he founded the town of Yaroslavl (literally, \"Yaroslav's\") on the Volga River. His relations with his father were apparently strained, and grew only worse on the news that Vladimir bequeathed the Kievan throne to his younger son, Boris. In 1014 Yaroslav refused to pay tribute to Kiev and only Vladimir's death, in July 1015, prevented a war.During the next four years Yaroslav waged a complicated and bloody war for Kiev against his half-brother Sviatopolk I of Kiev, who was supported by his father-in-law, Duke Boles\u0142aw I the Brave (King of Poland from 1025). During the course of this struggle, several other brothers (Boris, Gleb, and Svyatoslav) were brutally murdered. The Primary Chronicle accused Sviatopolk of planning those murders. The saga Eymundar \u00fe\u00e1ttr hrings is often interpreted as recounting the story of Boris' assassination by the Varangians in the service of Yaroslav.\nHowever, the victim's name is given there as Burizaf, which is also a name of Boleslaus I in the Scandinavian sources. It is thus possible that the Saga tells the story of Yaroslav's struggle against Sviatopolk (whose troops were commanded by the Polish duke), and not against Boris.Yaroslav defeated Sviatopolk in their first battle, in 1016, and Sviatopolk fled to Poland. Sviatopolk returned in 1018 with Polish troops furnished by his father-in-law, seized Kiev, and pushed Yaroslav back into Novgorod. Yaroslav prevailed over Sviatopolk, and in 1019 firmly established his rule over Kiev. One of his first actions as a grand prince was to confer on the loyal Novgorodians, who had helped him to gain the Kievan throne, numerous freedoms and privileges.\nThus, the foundation of the Novgorod Republic was laid. For their part, the Novgorodians respected Yaroslav more than they did other Kievan princes; and the princely residence in their city, next to the marketplace (and where the veche often convened) was named Yaroslav's Court after him.  It probably was during this period that Yaroslav promulgated the first code of laws in the lands of the East Slavs, the Russkaya Pravda.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At her father's behest, she remained in Florence after her marriage, affording her an unprecedented level of independence for a woman of her era. \nFollowing her mother's death and while Cosimo I was alive, Isabella served as the primary female figure in the Medici family and the First Lady of Florence, a role that was also recognised by other European courts during official occasions.\nIsabella de' Medici's legacy epitomises the dawn of modernity in Renaissance Italy, embodying progressive ideals ahead of her time. Recognised as an exceptional figure among the Medici women, Isabella wielded a rare combination of qualities, shaping Florence's cultural landscape.\nPractically a Grand Duchess in all but title, Isabella embodied beauty, culture, and intellect. Following in the footsteps of her Medici ancestors, she occupied a central role within Florence's vibrant cultural milieu, establishing a cultural circle including writers, poets, painters, and musicians, while championing the cause of female artists. Her dynamic spirit and cultural influence infused the Medici court with renewed vigour, propelling its second flourishing and transformation into a bustling hub of musical and literary innovation, all the while spearheading initiatives to establish vernacular Tuscan as Italy's official language.\nRejecting the conventional notion of being defined solely as her husband's possession, Isabella lived by her own principles, championing autonomy and personal freedom. Maintaining a distinct residence under her own name and continuing to use her maiden name after marriage, she defied societal norms that considered women as property of their husbands, asserting her autonomy and individuality. By reportedly engaging in a twelve-year long romantic relationship with her husband's cousin, Troilo Orsini, she sought parity with men, who enjoyed unrestrained liberties at the time.\nFollowing the death of her father, Isabella was possibly murdered by her husband, with the complicity of her brother, in retribution for her relationship with Troilo. Despite her significant contributions to Tuscan scholarship and arts, Isabella, a prominent intellectual figure in the late Medici court, saw her legacy overshadowed and possibly intentionally erased following her untimely death, prompting scholars to suggest the issuance of a damnatio memoriae against her by her brother.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Of Scottish descent, Dawson attended the University of Edinburgh to complete his education, and graduated in 1842, having gained a knowledge of geology and natural history from Robert Jameson.\nDawson returned to Nova Scotia in 1842, accompanying Sir Charles Lyell on his first visit to that territory. Dawson was subsequently appointed as Nova Scotia's first superintendent of education. Holding the post from 1850 to 1853, he was an energetic reformer of school design, teacher education and curriculum. Influenced by the American educator Henry Barnard, Dawson published a pamphlet titled, \"School Architecture; abridged from Barnard's School Architecture\" in 1850. One of the many schools built to his design, the Mount Hanley Schoolhouse still survives today, including the \"Dawson Desks\" named after him. Dawson's travels as school superintendent allowed him to deepen his geological studies, as he visited and studied geological sites across the region, leading to publication of his classic \"Acadian Geology\" (1855 and subsequent editions). He entered zealously into the geology of Canada, making a special study of the fossil forests of the coal-measures of Joggins, Nova Scotia, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. During the course of his second exploration of the cliffs with Charles Lyell in 1852, he discovered the remains of a tetrapod named Dendrerpeton entombed within a fossil tree. Over the years, he continued his exploration of the fossil trees, eventually unearthing the oldest known reptile in the history of life, which he named Hylonomus lyelli in honour of his mentor.From 1855 to 1893 he was professor of geology and principal of McGill University in Montreal, an institution which under his influence attained a high reputation. In 1859 he published a seminal paper describing the first fossil plant found in rocks of Devonian origin. Although his discovery did not have the impact that might have been expected at the time, he is now considered one of the founders of the science of palaeobotany. He later described the fossil plants of the Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of Canada for the Geological Survey of Canada (1871\u20131873). He was elected FRS (Fellow of the Royal Society) in 1862. When the Royal Society of Canada was created he was the first to occupy the presidential chair, and he also acted as president of the British Association at its meeting at Birmingham in 1886, president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1882, and president of the Geological Society of America in 1893.Sir William Dawson's name is especially associated with Eozoon canadense, which in 1865 he described as an organism having the structure of a foraminifer. It was found in the Laurentian rocks, regarded as the oldest known geological system. His views on the subject were contested at the time, and have since been disproven, the so-called organism being now regarded as a mineral structure.\nHe was appointed CMG in 1881, and was knighted in 1884. In 1882, while looking to fill the vacancy left at McGill by the death of botanist James Barnston, Dawson contacted Asa Gray of Harvard University for recommendations. Gray suggested his former assistant David P. Penhallow, whom Dawson accepted as a lecturer.He died in Montreal, 19 November 1899, and was buried in Mount Royal Cemetery. Lady Dawson served as President of the Ladies' Bible Association. Lady Dawson cofounded the Ladies' Educational Institute of Montreal with Mrs. John Molson and others. Sir William and Lady Dawson had several sons. The eldest, George Mercer Dawson, served as Director of the Geological Survey of Canada in 1895.\nHe is interred in the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal, Quebec, and is the namesake for Dawson College.

When Humayun returned to India from his exile, he asked his nobles to forge matrimonial alliances with various zamindars and feudal lords across the nation. Humayun married the elder daughter of Khanzada Jamal Khan of Mewat (now the Nuh district of Haryana) and he asked Bairam Khan to marry the younger daughter.\nThe Gazetteer of Ulwur (Alwar) states:\n\nAfter Babur's death, his successor, Humayun, in 1540 was supplanted as ruler by the Pathan Sher Shah Suri, who, in 1545, was followed by Islam Shah. During the reign of the latter, a battle was fought and lost by the emperor's troops at Firozpur Jhirka, in Mewat.  However, Islam Shah did not lose his hold on power. Adil Shah, the third of the Pathan interlopers, who succeeded Islam Shah in 1552, had to contend for the empire with Humayun.In these struggles for the restoration of Babur's dynasty the Khanzadas apparently do not figure at all. Humayun seems to have conciliated them by marrying the elder daughter of Khanzada Jamal Khan, nephew of Babur's opponent, Khanzada Hasan Khan Mewati, and by requiring his minister, Bairam Khan, to marry the younger daughter of the same Mewati.The Khanzadas, the royal family of Muslim Jadon (also spelt as Jadaun) Rajputs, converted to Islam after Islamic conquest of northern India. Khanzada, is the Persian form of the Indic word 'Rajput'. The Khanzadas were believed to have converted to Islam from a branch of Hindu Rajputs. They were the Mewatti chiefs of the Persian historians, who were the representatives of the lords of Mewat State.\nKhanzada, or \"the son of a Khan\" is precisely the Musalman equivalent to the Hindu Rajput or \"son of a Raja \" ...\nAfter Bairam Khan was murdered in Patan, Gujarat, his first wife and young Rahim were brought safely from Delhi to Ahmedabad and presented at the royal court of Akbar, who gave him the title of 'Mirza Khan', and subsequently married him to Mah Banu (Moon Lady) sister of Mirza Aziz Kokah, son of Ataga Khan, a noted Mughal noble.Later, Bairam Khan's second wife, Salima Sultan Begum (Rahim's stepmother) married her cousin, Akbar, which made Abdul Rahim Khan-i-Khan also his stepson, and later he became one of his nine prominent ministers, the Navaratnas, or nine gems. Aside from being a poet, Rahim Khan was also a general and was sent to deal with the rebellions in Gujarat and later served as the overall commander in the campaigns in Maharashtra.\nHe received the position and title of Khan-i-Khanan (Generalissimus, Persian \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646, DMG kh\u0101n-i kh\u0101n\u0101n, meaning \"Khan of Khans\").\nAbdul Rahim was known for his strange manner when giving alms to the poor.

His mother, Esther Edwards Burr, was the daughter of noted theologian Jonathan Edwards and his wife Sarah.Burr's father died in 1757 while serving as president of the college at Princeton. His grandfather, Jonathan Edwards, succeeded his father as president and came to live with Burr and his mother in December 1757.

Young Burr and his sister were then placed with the William Shippen family in Philadelphia. In 1759, the children's guardianship was assumed by their 21-year-old maternal uncle Timothy Edwards. The next year, Edwards married Rhoda Ogden and moved the family to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Burr attended the Elizabethtown Academy. Burr had a very strained relationship with his uncle, who was often physically abusive. As a child, he made several attempts to run away from home.At age 13, Burr was admitted to Princeton as a sophomore, where he joined the American Whig Society and the Cliosophic Society, the college's literary and debating societies.

{"id": "40_110", "question": "Who is Harald III of Norway's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "112_63351", "text": "The problem points (points of broken genealogy) in the medieval royal lineage in the so-called Fairhair dynasty are:\nwhether either Olaf I of Norway or Olaf II of Norway descended from Harald I of Norway (Harald Fairhair)\nwhether Harald III of Norway descended from Harald I\nwhether Harald IV of Norway was son of King Magnus III of Norway\nwhether King Sverre was son of King Sigurd II of Norway,\nwhether Haakon IV of Norway was son of King Haakon IIIEach of them came from \"nowhere\" and won the kingdom, the three latter claiming to be hitherto unknown natural sons of an earlier king.\nOlaf I is given a male-line descent from Harald I in the Icelandic sagas, as grandson of Harald's alleged son Olaf in Vika. However, Viken and its region of Norway, Vestfold, were not parts of Harald I's dominions but subject to the Danish kings at the time, making this connection dubious.  Further, the future king Olaf is said to have been born posthumously to a mother who had taken refuge in the Orkney Islands, yet the age assigned him in other sources would place his birth years after the date attributed to the death of his father.  The Heimskringla then relates that he was enslaved in Estonia as a three-year-old, only to tell his true parentage to the man who discovered him there and freed him six years later. Olaf II is likewise claimed to have been a male-line descendant of Harald I, as great-grandson of Harald I's alleged son Bj\u00f8rn in Vestfold, yet he is first known to history as a successful Viking marauder rather than a landed prince. The reliability of these two claims depends on the credibility of the Icelandic accounts (in particular Heimskringla) and the sources used to compile them, and if deemed unreliable, their reigns would represent distinct dynasties from that of Fairhair.\nHarald III is historically attested to have referred only to his kinship with his maternal half-brother, Olaf II. Much later legends (sagas authored under the patronage of royal courts of Harald III's descendants) claim Harald III's father also to have descended from Harald I (through Harald Fairhair's alleged son Sigurd Hrise).  Thus, Harald III's 'Hardrada dynasty' is represented in the sagas as a branch of the Fairhair dynasty. They also became known as the 'St. Olaf dynasty' in honor of the founder's half-brother.\nHarald IV arrived in Norway from his native Ireland and claimed to be the natural son of Magnus III, sired during the latter's Irish expedition. His claim seems, from historical sources, to be based on tales told by his Irish mother and family circle during his youth.  Were one to view these claims as dubious, then Harald IV instead gave rise to a new dynasty, the 'Gille' (Irish) or 'Gylle dynasty'.\nThe most seriously discredited alleged scion, practically regarded as an impostor by many modern academics, was Sverre I, who arrived in Norway from his native Faroe Islands, took up leadership in the embattled and heirless Birkebeiner party of the civil war, and claimed to be the natural son of Sigurd II by Gunhild, Sverre's attested mother. Sverre was sired during his mother's marriage with another man, Unas the Combmaker. Only in adulthood, so the claim goes according to legends, did his mother tell Sverre his 'real' paternity. Based on historical sources, no one else appears to have given the story credence. During that stage of the civil war, the strife was so intense that genealogical truth had evolved to a relative concept. Many royal pretenders claimed to be sons of King Sigurd II, and that was mostly a political statement \u2013 their claims were at best dubious. It may have meant just that the claimant desired to continue the perceived policies of Sigurd and his party, and in that sense were his 'sons'. Sverre I would be viewed as starting the Sverre dynasty.\nHaakon IV was born to a Norwegian peasant girl after the death of King Haakon III. She and the late king's inner circle affirmed that she had been the king's lover and that the boy had been sired by him. Of all the last-mentioned four problematic points of descent, this appears, on the face of it, as the most trustworthy. Were this disputed, Haakon IV, would be regarded as having started yet another new dynasty, though he is generally regarded as having continued the 'Sverre dynasty'.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Treaty of Ayton was signed on 30 September 1497, agreeing to a seven-year truce between Scotland and England. Shipping and trade were to be conducted according to the 1464 Treaty of York, and Border wardens on either side were given new powers to execute cross-border murderers after 20 days detention, and punish thieves caught red-handed, and neither King should harbour the other's rebels. The Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella were appointed to arbitrate future disputes and unresolved issues such as redress for damages caused by the recent invasions. The possibility was also raised of strengthening the peace between both kingdoms with the marriage of James IV to Henry VII's eldest daughter, Margaret.Following several years in which the Ayton agreement held, Scottish and English commissioners met at Richmond Palace on 24 January 1502. They agreed the marriage between James IV and Margaret, with a dowry of \u00a335,000 Scots, and a peace treaty between the two kingdoms.  Under the terms of the Treaty of Perpetual Peace, there was to be \"good, real and sincere, true, sound, and firm peace, friendship, league and confederation, to last all time coming\" between England and Scotland, neither king or their successors were to make war against the other, and if either king broke the treaty, the Pope would excommunicate them. In a ceremony at the altar of Glasgow Cathedral on 10 December 1502, James confirmed the Treaty of Perpetual Peace with Henry VII, the first peace treaty between Scotland and England since 1328. The marriage was completed by proxy on 25 January 1503 at Richmond Palace in the presence of the king and queen of England, the Earl of Bothwell standing as proxy for the Scottish king. Margaret left Richmond for Scotland on 27 June and, after crossing the border at Berwick upon Tweed on 1 August 1503, was received at Lamberton by the Archbishop of Glasgow and the Bishop of Moray. On 8 August 1503, the marriage of the 30-year old Scottish king and his 13-year-old English bride was celebrated in person in Holyrood Abbey. The rites were performed by Robert Blackadder, Archbishop of Glasgow and Thomas Savage, Archbishop of York. Their wedding was commemorated by the gift of the Hours of James IV of Scotland, and was portrayed as the marriage of The Thrissil and the Rois (the thistle and rose\u2014the flowers of Scotland and England, respectively) by the poet William Dunbar, who was then resident at James's court.Margaret did not bear her first child until 1507, when she was seventeen. James IV's marriage to Margaret meant that only the future Henry VIII stood between the Scottish king and the English succession, as Henry's lack of an heir made it possible that either James or one of his successors might succeed if the Tudors failed to produce heirs. Margaret's first pregnancy resulted in the birth of James, Duke of Rothesay at the Palace of Holyroodhouse  in February 1507. However, this heir to the throne died a year later in February 1508. At this point Margaret was already pregnant with a second child, a daughter whose name is unknown, and who was born and died in July 1508. In October 1509, a second son was born and named Arthur, a name recalling Margaret's late brother, Arthur, Prince of Wales, and reminding the still heirless Henry VIII that, if he were unable to produce a legitimate son to succeed him, it might be a son of Margaret Tudor who would succeed.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In Antoku's absence, the cloistered former-Emperor Go-Shirakawa then elevated his young brother by decree; and the young child was given the acceptance of abdication (juzen) rites. The anti-Taira faction intended that the succession ('\u2018senso'\u2019) was received; and shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Toba is said to have acceded to the throne ('\u2018sokui'\u2019).Although these formal rites and ceremonies were taking place in Heian-ky\u014d, the imperial regalia were still held by Antoku. Thus, the senso and sokui of Go-Toba became the first in history to omit the ritual transmission of the sacred treasures from a sovereign to his successor.In 1192 Go-Shirakawa died and the first shogunate was established by Minamoto no Yoritomo, and the emperor became a figurehead.In 1198, Go-Toba abdicated in favor of his son, Emperor Tsuchimikado.\nGo-Toba reigned as cloistered Emperor from 1198 till 1221 during reigns of three emperors, but his power was more limited than former cloistered Emperors in the Heian period.\nIt was during this time that Go-Toba decreed that the followers of the Pure Land sect in Ky\u014dto, led by H\u014dnen, be banished or in some cases executed. Originally this was prompted by complaints of clergy in Kyoto who were concerned about the rise in popularity of the new sect, but Go-Toba personally ordered the decree after two of his ladies in waiting converted to the sect without his knowledge.In 1221, the sh\u014dgun installed Go-Toba's three-year-old grandson, Emperor Ch\u016bky\u014d, as emperor, but Go-Toba chose to stage a rebellion in an attempt to reclaim the throne and overthrow the Kamakura shogunate.

He was the son of Clovis I and one of his earlier wives or concubines (possibly a Franco-Rhenish Princess, Evochildis of Cologne). In accordance with Salian tradition, the kingdom was divided between Clovis's four surviving sons: Childebert I in Paris, Chlodomer in Orl\u00e9ans, and Chlothar I in Soissons. Theuderic inherited Metz in 511 at his father's death. Early in his reign, he sent his son Theudebert to kill the Scandinavian King Chlochilaich (Hygelac of Beowulf fame) who had invaded his realm.\nTheuderic got involved in the war between the Thuringian King Hermanfrid and his brother Baderic. Theuderic was promised half of Thuringia for his help; Baderic was defeated, but the land promised was not given up. In 531, Theuderic then, with his brother Chlothar and his son, attacked Thuringia to avenge himself on Hermanfrid. With the assistance of the Saxons under Duke Hadugato, Thuringia was conquered, and Chlothar received Radegund, daughter of King Berthar (Hermanfrid's late brother). Hermanfrid was killed in battle at Unstrut and his kingdom was annexed.The four sons of Clovis then all fought the Burgundian kings Sigismund and Godomar; Godomar fled and Sigismund was taken prisoner by Chlodomer.

Having been completed this condition, he again ranged himself among Philip's partisans and still later was among the supporters of the young King Frederick II. In 1212 Frederick granted the Golden Bull of Sicily to Bohemia. This document recognised Ottokar and his heirs as Kings of Bohemia. The king was no longer subject to appointment by the emperor and was only required to attend Diets close to the Bohemian border.  Although a subject of the Holy Roman Empire, the Bohemian king was to be the leading electoral prince of the Holy Roman Empire and to furnish all subsequent emperors with a bodyguard of 300 knights when they went to Rome for their coronation.\nOttokar's reign was also notable for the start of German immigration into Bohemia and the growth of towns in what had until that point been forest lands.  In 1226, Ottokar went to war against Duke Leopold VI of Austria after the latter wrecked a deal that would have seen Ottokar's daughter (Saint Agnes of Bohemia) married to Frederick II's son Henry II of Sicily.  Ottokar then planned for the same daughter to marry Henry III of England, but this was vetoed by the emperor, who knew Henry to be an opponent of the Hohenstaufen dynasty.

Both of Nur Jahan's parents were descendants of illustrious families \u2013 Ghiyas Beg from Muhammad Sharif and Asmat Begum from the Aqa Mulla clan. Her paternal grandfather, Khwaja Muhammad Sharif, was first a wazir to Tatar Sultan the governor of Khurasan, and later was in the service of Shah Tahmasp, who made him the wazir of Isfahan, in recognition of his excellent service. For unknown reasons, Ghiyas Beg's family had suffered a reversal in fortunes in 1577 and soon found circumstances in their homeland intolerable. Hoping to improve his family's fortunes, Ghiyas Beg chose to relocate to India where the Emperor Akbar's court was said to be at the centre of the growing trade industry and cultural scene.Halfway along their route the family was attacked by robbers who took from them their remaining meager possessions. Left with only two mules, Ghiyas Beg, his pregnant wife, and their two children (Muhammad Sharif, Asaf Khan) were forced to take turns riding on the backs of the animals for the remainder of their journey. When the family arrived in Kandahar, Asmat Begum gave birth to their second daughter. The family was so impoverished they feared they would be unable to take care of the newborn baby. Fortunately, the family was taken in by a caravan led by the merchant noble Malik Masud, who would later assist Ghiyas Beg in finding a position in the service of Emperor Akbar. Believing that the child had signaled a change in the family's fate, she was named Mehr-un-Nissa or \u2018Sun among Women\u2019.

She schemes to replace him on the throne with her submissive young son Sung-won (Kim Dong-wook). Indifferent to his mother's plans, the timid prince falls in love at first sight with Hwa-yeon (Jo Yeo-jeong), an aristocrat's daughter, who has already found love with Kwon-yoo (Kim Min-jun), a low-born commoner. When her father (Ahn Suk-hwan) is obligated to send her into the royal palace as a concubine for the king, the two lovers try to elope but are caught after their first night together. Hwa-yeon agrees to enter the palace in exchange for saving Kwon-yoo's life.\nFive years later, Hwa-yeon has become the Queen from giving birth to a son. Sung-won comes back from traveling to see the King upon hearing of his ill-health. In a private conversation, Sung-won gifts a hair stick to Hwa-yeon as a present and confession of his feelings.\nThe king dies of a mysterious illness, and the former concubine sits her son, Prince Sung-won, on the throne as a puppet king, naming herself Regent and Queen Mother and taking firm control over the royal court. Hwa-yeon is moved to a closely watched, humble residence, where she is under constant surveillance. When Hwa-yeon's father, a royal court minister, attempts to prove that the previous king died from poisonous assassination, he and all of the ministers disloyal to the queen mother are arrested for treason.\nHwa-yeon discovers her former lover, Kwon-yoo, working in the castle among the eunuchs. Initially glad to see him, she reaches out for comfort and assistance, hoping some of their original feelings remain. Though his life was spared, Kwon-yoo was castrated by Hwa-yeon's father for daring to elope with her and he is now resentful and embittered towards both of them. Kwon-yoo has aligned himself with Minister Yoon and the Queen Mother to find power in his new position and rebuffs Hwa-yeon. Hwa-yeon's efforts to free her father and rescue him from execution are sabotaged by Kwon-yoo, who directly undermines Sung-won's exoneration orders to ensure the man's death. Kwon-yoo agrees to assassinate Hwa-yeon and her child with a block of poisonous aconite received from Minister Yoon by the orders of the Queen Mother, who wishes to secure her position and remove Hwa-yeon from influencing Sung-won.\nSung-won is still very attracted to Hwa-yeon, bestowing favors and attention. In a fit of pique, he takes Geum-ok, Hwa-yeon's personal maid, as a minor concubine so he can inquire about Hwa-yeon's private habits. One night, Sung-won enters Geum-ok's room and is frothed into a rage when he sees her wearing the hair stick he had gifted to Hwa-yeon. To save her own life, Geum-ok reveals that Kwon-yoo had a relationship with Hwa-yeon, and that the young prince had been born prematurely, making his parentage suspect. Sung-won confronts Hwa-yeon, accusing her of hiding her lover as a fake eunuch, but dismisses the accusations after pulling down Kwon-yoo's pants to reveal his castration. Sung-won attempts to rape Hwa-yeon, but Hwa-yeon shoves him off and tells him to \"come back when you become a true King.\"\nAfter this incident, Kwon-yoo believes that he is the father of Hwa-yeon's child from the night they eloped together and has a change of heart about helping her, swearing to protect her and her son at any cost. In order to place his son on the throne and place a trap for the Queen Mother and King, Kwon-yoo turns on Minister Yoon by placing the poison in Sung-woo's medicinal drink. However, Kwon-yoo is left with no choice but to drink his own concoction to allay suspicion from Hwa-yeon and his child. After Kwon-yoo's violent reaction to the poisonous medicinal drink, the interrogated physician admits that Minister Yoon, who is directly beneath the Queen Mother, is head of medicine.\nHwa-yeon has sent her son away for his safety and been imprisoned by the Queen Mother, who charges Hwa-yeon with treason and orders Minister Yoon to end both the mother and son's life. Sung-won accuses his mother of trying to poison him, leading to her admission that she had poisoned the previous king to place Sung-won on the throne, which horrifies him since he had loved his brother and never desired to be king. Kwon-yoo and Minister Yoon are brought in to confirm or deny the plot to poison the current king. Keeping his promise to Hwa-yeon to protect her and her son, Kwon-yoo lies, saying the Queen Mother was behind Sung-woo's assassination attempt, with Minister Yoon providing the poison. Sung-woo orders the men's execution and for the Queen Mother to be permanently placed under house arrest in her chambers.\nIn a carriage heading towards his execution, Kwon-yoo says his goodbyes and asks Hwa-yeon to protect their son after he dies, but Hwa-yeon replies \"Our son? The prince is no one's son. He is my son.\" Kwon-yoo is devastated he has sacrificed his life for Hwa-yeon's child, who may not be his own.\nSung-woo, now a true king, is greeted in his room by Hwa-yeon and the two engage in sexual intercourse before Hwa-yeon kills him.

Her hair is usually depicted in a shade of fuchsia, although in the first chapter and the anime her hair is turquoise. When asked about the first time Bulma's hairstyle changed, Toriyama said it was to show that three years had passed and because he personally liked girls with short hair. She sometimes wears clothing with either her name on it or the Capsule Corporation logo.Her name \"Buruma\" is the Japanese pronunciation of \"bloomer\", a type of gym shorts worn by Japanese girls at school. As with most characters in the Dragon Ball series, Bulma's name is consistent with those of the rest of her family. All of Bulma's family members are named after underclothing of some sort. Her father's name is Dr. Brief, while her son and daughter are named Trunks and Bra (\u30d6\u30e9, Bura, \"Bulla\" in the English anime dub) respectively. Her mother is never named in the original series, being referred to only as \"Bulma's Mother\" (\u30d6\u30eb\u30de\u306e\u30de\u30de, Buruma no Mama). However, when asked in 2004 what name he would choose if he were to name her mother, Toriyama suggested Panchy (\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1\u30fc, Panch\u012b), a pun on panties. However, in the video game, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, Bulma's mother's name was revealed as Bikini (\u30d3\u30ad\u30cb, Bikini). Toriyama stated in an interview that Bulma's family has a \"laissez-faire attitude, but Bulma has complete control over things.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Prior to the event, Ham commented, \"I don't see it as a debate to win or lose. I don't believe people should go away saying 'Bill Nye won' or 'Ken Ham won.' I want to passionately deal with what I believe, and I want Bill Nye to passionately speak on what he believes.\" In a letter published in Skeptical Inquirer after the debate, Nye wrote that by \"a strong majority of accounts, I bested him.\"Scientists typically stated that Nye won the debate. University of Chicago biologist Jerry Coyne contested Ham's distinction between historical science and observational science: \"Science based on historical reconstruction, when done properly, is just as valid as science based on direct, real-time observation.\" While Coyne felt the debate may have given undeserved credibility to the creationist viewpoint, he concluded that, \"The debate was Ham's to win and he lost. And the debate was Nye's to lose and he won.\" Science blogger Greg Laden, who had earlier expressed concerns about Nye's lack of evolutionary expertise, believed Nye's victory was as lop-sided as the Seattle Seahawks' victory over the Denver Broncos in the recently played Super Bowl XLVIII. He noted that Nye charmed the \"evangelical audience\" with his style, while the NCSE noted that Ham \u2013 \"no mean orator\", according to the NCSE \u2013 \"sometimes rambled far afield, and [his presentation] often raced by so quickly that it was hard even to know what he was saying\". Daily Beast writer Michael Schulson, however, used the same Seahawks-Broncos analogy to declare Ham the resounding victor. Although Schulson agreed with Nye's underlying scientific message, and allowed that Nye \"had his moments,\" he wrote that \"it was easy to pick out the smarter man on the stage. Oddly, it was the same man who was arguing that the earth is 6,000 years old.\" He believed that Ham's simpler presentation made him sound like \"a reasonable human being\", while Nye lost his audience by \"sounding like a clueless geek, even if his points were scientifically valid\".Evangelical blogger Ezra Byer credited Ham with raising awareness of the Christian message, but felt he failed to provide compelling factual evidence for his beliefs. As partial explanation, Byer noted, \"As I watched Mr. Ham's mannerisms, you could sense a tremendous Spirit about him. He was gracious and the power of God showed through his life. There were multiple times I believed he could have hammered Nye on some of his inconsistencies but in my opinion chose not to.\"The Biologos Foundation stated \"that one of the lasting effects of this debate will be to further alienate Christianity from science in the public consciousness.\" The Australian Broadcasting Corporation said that the debate \"drew world attention, once again, on the United States as the home of whacky Christianity.\"Michael Behe, a biologist at Lehigh University and an advocate of intelligent design, felt that by \"talking on about the age of the Earth [rather] than on the elegance and complexities of life\", both Ham and Nye lost the debate. Metropolitan Nicholas of the Greek Orthodox Church, who was trained as a scientist before taking holy orders, also criticized both Nye's and Ham's approach to the debate, saying that \"Research that is done to challenge God, has the disease of prejudice. Research is done to discover scientific truth. What problem is there with someone wanting to broaden the horizons of their thoughts and knowledge? God is approached better this way. God is not an ideology that we should by all means defend, but we believe in Him because He is Truth. In this sense, even scientific truth reveals Him. If He is still questioned, it is time to find out about Him. A believer who fears scientific research, fears the truth. Perhaps he is a believer who does not believe.\"On February 27, 2014, Ham announced that the publicity the debate generated for AiG had spurred fundraising for its stalled Ark Encounter project, allowing the first phase of construction \u2013 a 510-foot (160 m) representation of Noah's Ark estimated to cost $73 million \u2013 to begin. Following the announcement, Nye told the Associated Press he hopes the project \"goes out of business\", adding \"If [Ham] builds that ark, it's my strong opinion, it's bad for the commonwealth of Kentucky and bad for scientists based in Kentucky and bad for the U.S. And I'm not joking, bad for the world.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The family of his mother, Ella, had been influenced by Herrnhut pietism. His only sibling, his sister Klara (1904-2001), who later called herself Mutter Basilea Schlink, became a popular religious writer and leader. Edmund Schlink attended public schools in Darmstadt. In 1922 he matriculated at T\u00fcbingen University, where he studied mathematics, philosophy, psychology, physics, and other natural sciences. He also attended the universities of Munich, Kiel, Vienna, and Marburg. He completed his first Ph.D. dissertation (in religious psychology) at Marburg in 1927. This dissertation explores personality changes in people who undergo a religious conversion and in those who are suffering from clinical depression. During the prior year (1926), he himself had undergone a religious conversion after suffering a crisis of faith. As a result of this experience, he changed his academic focus to theology, which he studied at the University of M\u00fcnster. There he wrote his second dissertation (on a problem in natural theology), under the direction of Karl Barth. He then served as an assistant pastor to congregations in Buchschlag and Sprendlingen, and in the fall of 1932 he became a campus pastor at the Technical University of Darmstadt. In 1934 he completed his third dissertation, his post-doctoral theological thesis (Habilitationsschrift), which was accepted at the University of Giessen. This post-doctoral thesis in theological anthropology examines how human beings have been understood in the preaching of the church.As a member of the Confessing Church, Schlink supported the Barmen Declaration. He later interpreted this confession favorably in light of several key teachings in the Book of Concord, especially the distinction between law and gospel. Because of pressure from the Gestapo, which he and his superiors received as a result of his public criticism of the German Christians (Deutsche Christen), Schlink was removed from his teaching position at Giessen. Between 1935 and 1939 he taught at the seminary in Bethel, near Bielefeld (see also Bethel Foundation). After the Gestapo closed that seminary in 1939 and restricted Schlink's speaking and public movement, Schlink began serving as a pastor to several \"confessing\" congregations in Hesse and Westphalia. These included the Marienkirche and St. Reinoldikirche in Dortmund and eventually the Neust\u00e4dter Marienkirche in Bielefeld. During 1943 and 1944, he also traveled monthly to Strasbourg for two-week periods in which he taught practical theology to seminarians there. In 1945 he became the director of the preachers' seminary in Soest for the Evangelical Church of Westphalia. After only a year there, he was called to become a professor of dogmatic and ecumenical theology at Heidelberg University. He would remain a member of this faculty until his retirement in 1971.Schlink was married twice. His first wife, Elisabeth Winkelmann, with whom he had two daughters, died in 1936. He married his second wife, Irmgard Oswald (1914-2006), in 1938. They had two sons, Wilhelm Schlink (d. 2018) who was an art historian, and Bernhard Schlink, who is a lawyer and novelist.

Her name meant \"Opening Wisdom\", although she came to be nicknamed Xia, meaning \"Little Dawn.\" Her father was Yang Changji, a teacher and leftist intellectual, her mother was Xiang Zhenxi, while she had a brother three years older than her, Yang Kaizhi. Through his teaching of ethics at the First Normal School of Changsha, Changji had become a father figure to a pupil named Mao Zedong, later writing in his journal that \"it is truly difficult to imagine someone so intelligent and handsome\" as him. A friendship developing, in summer 1916, Mao was invited to spend several days at Yang's Bancang home, walking twenty miles in straw sandals in order to get there. On this occasion, he did not talk to either Zhenxi or Kaizhi, instead bowing his head to them as a mark of respect.Yang Changji gained a professorship at Peking University and had moved his family to the city when Mao came to Peking in September 1918 with several like-minded friends from Hunan. Upon arrival, they stayed in the Yangs' small house in the north of the city. Here, Mao met Kaihui again, and the two discovered a mutual attraction. A friend who knew Kaihui at the time described her as \"small in stature and round-faced, with deep-set eyes and pale white skin\", and her appearance impressed both Mao and his friends. Kaihui later related that she had \"fallen madly in love with him already when I heard about his numerous accomplishments\" but did not make her feelings immediately known. She kept \"hoping and dreaming\" that he shared her feelings and decided that she would never marry anyone but him.Their relationship did not develop swiftly, as Mao was shy and lacked sufficient funds to court her, living in cramped rented accommodation with other Hunanese students in Peking's Three-Eyed Well district. Changji secured Mao a job at the university library as assistant to the librarian Li Dazhao, an early Chinese communist.In January 1920, Yang Changji died. Mao was in Peking ostensibly on business, though biographer Stuart Schram suspected his presence was partly due to his desire to comfort Kaihui. Yang Kaihui and her mother returned to Changsha with her father's remains, and she soon entered the Fusiang Girls\u2019 School. At the missionary school, her exposure to revolutionary ideas got her labeled a 'rebel', who refused to pray and cut her hair short in defiance of convention.Mao had gone from Peking to Shanghai, where he worked in a laundry and joined a Communist group for the first time. Following the overthrow of Hunanese warlord Zhang Jingyao by generals favourable to Mao, he returned to Changsha in July 1920. Mao opened a bookstore and publishing house.

Inside was an ancient, mythological demon, the Green Goblin. He naturally came to life. On my own, I changed Stan's mythological demon into a human villain.\n\nThe Green Goblin debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his identity was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which made a point of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who had not yet been introduced. Lee elaborated:\n\nSteve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then what was the point of following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader.\n\nHowever, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character. Moreover, in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).\n\nDitko left the series with issue #38, just one issue after Norman Osborn was introduced as the father of Harry Osborn. The first issue without Ditko saw the Green Goblin unmasked. John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, recalled: Stan wouldn't have been able to stand it if Ditko did the story and didn't reveal that the Green Goblin was Norman Osborn. I didn't know there was any doubt about Osborn being the Goblin. I didn't know that Ditko had just been setting Osborn up as a straw dog. I just accepted the fact that it was going to be Norman Osborn when we plotted it. I had been following the last couple of issues and didn't think there was really much mystery about it. Looking back, I doubt the Goblin's identity would have been revealed in Amazing #39 if Ditko had stayed on.\nIn the landmark story, \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\" (The Amazing Spider-Man #121\u2013122), the Green Goblin kills Gwen Stacy and later perishes in a fight against Spider-Man. However, the story's writer, Gerry Conway, had Harry Osborn adopt the Green Goblin identity in that story's aftermath, later remarking that \"I never had any intention of getting rid of the Green Goblin as a concept\". Harry Osborn's becoming the Green Goblin was mostly well-received, with fans remarking that Harry was more menacing than his father had ever been.Several other characters would take on the Green Goblin identity, and writer Roger Stern later introduced the Hobgoblin to replace the Green Goblin as Spider-Man's archenemy. In addition, a retcon during the \"Clone Saga\" determined that the original Green Goblin survived the events of The Amazing Spider-Man #122 and had been playing a behind-the-scenes role in Spider-Man's adventures since then.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "40_174", "question": "Who is Elizabeth Barrett Browning's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_69008", "text": "Barrett Browning was widely popular in the United Kingdom and the United States during her lifetime. Edgar Allan Poe was inspired by her poem Lady Geraldine's Courtship and specifically borrowed the poem's metre for his poem The Raven. Poe had reviewed Barrett Browning's work in the January 1845 issue of the Broadway Journal, writing that \"her poetic inspiration is the highest \u2013 we can conceive of nothing more august. Her sense of Art is pure in itself.\" In return, she praised The Raven, and Poe dedicated his 1845 collection The Raven and Other Poems to her, referring to her as \"the noblest of her sex\".Barrett Browning's poetry greatly influenced Emily Dickinson, who admired her as a woman of achievement. Her popularity in the United States and Britain was advanced by her stands against social injustice, including slavery in the United States, injustice toward Italians from their foreign rulers, and child labour.Lilian Whiting published a biography of Barrett Browning (1899) which describes her as \"the most philosophical poet\" and depicts her life as \"a Gospel of applied Christianity\". To Whiting, the term \"art for art's sake\" did not apply to Barrett Browning's work, as each poem, distinctively purposeful, was borne of a more \"honest vision\". In this critical analysis, Whiting portrays Barrett Browning as a poet who uses knowledge of Classical literature with an \"intuitive gift of spiritual divination\". In Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Angela Leighton suggests that the portrayal of Barrett Browning as the \"pious iconography of womanhood\" has distracted us from her poetic achievements. Leighton cites the 1931 play by Rudolf Besier The Barretts of Wimpole Street as evidence that 20th-century literary criticism of Barrett Browning's work has suffered more as a result of her popularity than poetic ineptitude. The play was popularized by actress Katharine Cornell, for whom it became a signature role. It was an enormous success, both artistically and commercially, and was revived several times and adapted twice into movies. Sampson, however, considers the play to have been the most damaging cause of false myths about Elizabeth, and particularly the relationship with her, allegedly 'tyrannical', father.Throughout the 20th century, literary criticism of Barrett Browning's poetry remained sparse until her poems were discovered by the women's movement. She once described herself as being inclined to reject several women's rights principles, suggesting in letters to Mary Russell Mitford and her husband that she believed that there was an inferiority of intellect in women. In Aurora Leigh, however, she created a strong and independent woman who embraces both work and love. Leighton writes that because Elizabeth participates in the literary world, where voice and diction are dominated by perceived masculine superiority, she \"is defined only in mysterious opposition to everything that distinguishes the male subject who writes...\" A five-volume scholarly edition of her works was published in 2010, the first in over a century.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She also edited and promoted the works of her husband, the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley. Her father was the political philosopher William Godwin and her mother was the philosopher and women's rights advocate Mary Wollstonecraft.\nMary's mother died 11 days after giving birth to her. She was raised by her father, who provided her with a rich if informal education, encouraging her to adhere to his own anarchist political theories. When she was four, her father married a neighbour, Mary Jane Clairmont, with whom Mary came to have a troubled relationship.In 1814, Mary began a romance with one of her father's political followers, Percy Bysshe Shelley, who was already married. Together with her stepsister, Claire Clairmont, she and Percy left for France and travelled through Europe. Upon their return to England, Mary was pregnant with Percy's child. Over the next two years, she and Percy faced ostracism, constant debt and the death of their prematurely born daughter. They married in late 1816, after the suicide of Percy Shelley's first wife, Harriet.\nIn 1816, the couple and Mary's stepsister famously spent a summer with Lord Byron and John William Polidori near Geneva, Switzerland, where Shelley conceived the idea for her novel Frankenstein. The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Shelley gave birth to her last and only surviving child, Percy Florence Shelley. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was dogged by illness, most likely caused by the brain tumour which killed her at the age of 53.\nUntil the 1970s, Shelley was known mainly for her efforts to publish her husband's works and for her novel Frankenstein, which remains widely read and has inspired many theatrical and film adaptations. Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Shelley's achievements. Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826) and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829\u20131846), support the growing view that Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The Venetian people had elected him against the will of the Byzantine Empire, a consequence of the Byzantines' unwelcome attempts to institute iconoclasm in the West. Virtually nothing is known of his life before his accession, though it is reasonable to assume that he was born in the latter part of the seventh century.\n\nDescribed by one historian as being a 'warlike man', his reign saw much innovation in the way of martial and naval matters. He focused especially on strengthening the navy against the Lombards and other like-minded invaders active at the time. Additionally he strove to highlight the importance of military exercises, and to this end established schools in Eraclea where the town's youth were coached in bow and crossbow shooting.Of note was Orso's involvement in the recovery of Ravenna following its capture by the Lombard king Liutprand. It is said that, at the request of Exarch Eutychius, Orso sent a fleet of eighty ships to the fore, successfully relieving the city of Lombard control. This feat served to ease relations with the Byzantine Empire, and while Venice by no means accepted its supremacy, the two co-existed in relative concord.For his efforts Orso was awarded the prestigious title hypatos by Emperor Leo the Isaurian. The surname Ipato is thought to be derived from this imperial honorific.\nHis reign came to an end in 737 in the midst of mounting conflict between Eraclea and Equilio, described by some as being a full-blown civil war. It is said that the Doge, rather than attempt to calm the situation, sided with the Eracleans and partook in the war \u2013 leading a number of his disgruntled subjects to take matters into their own hands and violently kill him.In the years following his death there was an interregnum filled by five magistri militum, the first of these being Domenico Leoni.

He was the son of Penda of Mercia and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, Wulfhere of Mercia, died from an illness.  Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of Rochester. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the Northumbrians, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the Humber. It also permanently returned the Kingdom of Lindsey to Mercia's possession. However, \u00c6thelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors' domination of southern Britain.\nHe was known as a pious and devout Christian king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the church's diocesan structure, creating several new sees in Mercia and Northumbria.  \u00c6thelred befriended Bishop Wilfrid of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; \u00c6thelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the Middle Angles during his exile and supported him at the synod of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria.\n\u00c6thelred's wife, Osthryth, was a daughter of King Oswiu, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings.

During the Anshi Rebellion (which Emperor Suzong's entire reign was dedicated to fighting), he served as a general of Tang and Huige joint operations that recaptured the capital Chang'an and the eastern capital Luoyang from the rebel state of Yan, and the Anshi Rebellion was finally put down early in his own reign, in 763.  However, thereafter, the Tang state was plagued by warlords such as Tian Chengsi, Li Baochen, and Liang Chongyi who essentially governed their realms as independent states while only pledging nominal loyalty to the emperor. This would prove disastrous for future generations as subsequent Tang emperors were unable to remove or control these warlords and the central government's power was thus slowly eroded and diminished.

Constantine had a son but the identity of the mother was not recorded.\nWith the favor of Romanos, Christopher held seniority among the four junior co-emperors. He was the heir to the throne while Constantine VII, Stephen, and Constantine Lekapenos were to remain junior co-rulers. However Christopher died in 931. Romanos did not advance his younger sons in precedence over Constantine VII. His son-in-law was now the heir over his own sons. Helena was bound to become the principal empress upon the death of her father.\nThis period lasted until 16 December 944.

He is partnered with David Mills, a young, short-tempered, idealistic detective who recently relocated to the city with his wife, Tracy. On Monday, Somerset and Mills investigate an obese man who was forced to eat until his stomach burst, killing him. The detectives find the word \"gluttony\" written on a wall. Somerset, considering the case too extreme for his last investigation, asks to be reassigned but his request is denied. The following day, another victim, who had been forced to cut one pound (0.45 kg) of flesh from his body is found; the crime scene is marked \"greed\". Clues at the scene lead Somerset and Mills to the sloth victim, a drug-dealing pederast whom they find emaciated and restrained to a bed. Photographs reveal the victim was restrained for exactly one year. Somerset surmises the murders are based on the Christian concept of the seven deadly sins.\nTracy invites Somerset to share supper with her and Mills, helping the detectives overcome their mutual hostility. On Friday, Tracy meets privately with Somerset because she has no other acquaintances in the city. She reveals her unhappiness at moving there, especially after learning she is pregnant, and believes the city is an unfit place to raise a child. Somerset sympathizes with Tracy, having persuaded his former girlfriend to abort their child for similar reasons and regretting it ever since; he advises Tracy to inform Mills only if she intends to keep the child.\nA remark by Mills inspires Somerset to research libraries for anyone checking out books based on the seven deadly sins, leading the pair to John Doe's apartment. Unexpectedly, Doe returns home and is pursued by Mills. Doe incapacitates Mills by striking him with a tire iron and holds him at gunpoint, but chooses to leave him alive and flees. The police investigate Doe's apartment, finding a large amount of cash, hundreds of Doe's notebooks, and photographs of some of his victims; the cache includes images of Somerset and Mills by a person they believed was an intrusive journalist at the sloth crime scene. Doe calls the apartment and speaks of his admiration for Mills.\nOn Saturday, Somerset and Mills investigate the fourth victim, lust, a prostitute who has been raped with a custom-made, bladed strap-on by a man held at gunpoint. The following day, the pride victim is found\u2014a model whom Doe facially disfigured. Unable to live without her beauty she committed suicide. As Somerset and Mills return to the police station, Doe arrives and surrenders himself. He threatens to plead insanity at his trial, potentially escaping punishment, unless Mills and Somerset escort him to an undisclosed location where they will find the envy and wrath victims. During the drive, Doe says he believes God has chosen him to send a message about the ubiquity of, and apathy toward, sin. Doe has no remorse for his victims, believing the shocking murders will force society to pay attention to him.\nDoe leads the detectives to a remote location, where a delivery van approaches. Somerset intercepts the vehicle, whose driver was instructed to deliver a package to Mills at this specific time and location. Somerset is horrified at the package's contents and tells Mills to put down his gun. Doe reveals he himself represents envy because he envied Mills' life with Tracy, and implies the package contains her severed head. He urges Mills to become wrath, telling him Tracy begged for her life and that of her unborn child, and takes pleasure in realizing Mills was unaware of the pregnancy. Despite Somerset's pleas, Mills, distraught and enraged, shoots Doe dead, completing Doe's plan.

The family moved to Los Angeles in 1923 after Gene's father passed the civil service test and was given a police commission there. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the Skylark series by E. E. Smith.Roddenberry majored in police science at Los Angeles City College, where he began dating Eileen-Anita Rexroat and became interested in aeronautical engineering. He obtained a pilot's license through the United States Army Air Corps-sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program. He enlisted with the USAAC on December 18, 1941 and married Eileen on June 13, 1942. He graduated from the USAAC on August 5, 1942, when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.He was posted to Bellows Field, Oahu, to join the 394th Bomb Squadron, 5th Bombardment Group, of the Thirteenth Air Force, which flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.On August 2, 1943, while flying B-17E-BO, 41-2463, \"Yankee Doodle\", out of Espiritu Santo, the plane Roddenberry was piloting overran the runway by 500 feet (150 m) and crashed into trees, crushing the nose and starting a fire as well as killing two men: bombardier Sgt. John P. Kruger and navigator Lt. Talbert H. Woolam. The official report absolved Roddenberry of any responsibility. Roddenberry spent the remainder of his military career in the United States and flew all over the country as a plane crash investigator. He was involved in a second plane crash, this time as a passenger. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.In 1945, Roddenberry began flying for Pan American World Airways, including routes from New York to Johannesburg or Calcutta, the two longest Pan Am routes at the time. Listed as a resident of River Edge, New Jersey, he experienced his third crash while on the Clipper Eclipse on June 18, 1947. The plane came down in the Syrian Desert, and Roddenberry, who took control as the ranking flight officer, suffered two broken ribs but was able to drag injured passengers out of the burning plane and led the group to get help. Fourteen (or fifteen) people died in the crash; eleven passengers required hospital treatment (including Bishnu Charan Ghosh), and eight were unharmed. Roddenberry resigned from Pan Am on May 15, 1948, and decided to pursue his dream of writing, particularly for the new medium of television.Roddenberry applied for a position with the Los Angeles Police Department on January 10, 1949, and spent his first sixteen months in the traffic division before being transferred to the newspaper unit. This became the Public Information Division, and Roddenberry became the Chief of Police's speech writer. In this position, he also became the LAPD liaison to the very popular Dragnet television series, providing technical advisors for specific episodes.  He also did his first TV writing for the show, taking actual cases, and boiling them down to short screen treatments that would be fleshed out into full scripts by Jack Webb's staff of writers, and splitting the fee with the officers who actually investigated the real-life case. He became then technical advisor for a new television version of Mr. District Attorney, which led to him writing for the show under his pseudonym \"Robert Wesley\". He began to collaborate with Ziv Television Programs and continued to sell scripts to Mr. District Attorney, in addition to Ziv's Highway Patrol. In early 1956, he sold two story ideas for I Led Three Lives, and he found that it was becoming increasingly difficult to be a writer and a policeman.

She would have been overshadowed at court by the  chief queens Nefertari, and later Iaret. Mutemwiya is only shown on the monuments of her son Amenhotep III.While she occasionally was identified by some researchers as a daughter of King Artatama I of Mitanni, no evidence proves that she is the same person, and nothing about her own background is known. There seemed to be evidence that she was not a daughter of Artatama, but this theory has been discarded.Cyril Aldred has suggested that Mutemwiya be a sister of Yuya. He argues that since Mutemwiya was present during the early years of her son's reign, she might have engineered the marriage between Tiye and the young king to connect her family with royalty. However, this theory is poorly supported by texts or archaeological finds.\nMutemwiya held many titles including God\u2019s Wife (Hm.t-nTr), Lady of The Two Lands (nb.t-tAwy), Great King\u2019s Wife, his beloved (Hm.t-nsw-wr.t mry.t=f), noblewoman (r.t-pa.t), countess, Great of Praises (wr.t-Hsw.t), Sweet of Love (bnr.t-mrw.t), Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt (Hnw.t-rsy-mHw), and God's Mother (mwt-nTr). The titles king's mother and god's mother amount to the same thing since the god in question was the reigning king, Amenhotep III. \nAll of these titles, including that of Great Royal Wife, were used only after her husband's death, during her son's reign.  At the time of Amenhotep III\u2019s accession to the throne she gained prominence as the new pharaoh's mother.Mutemwiya is shown in the Luxor temple, in scenes depicting the divine birth of her son Amenhotep III. The scenes resemble (and in some cases copy) scenes of the divine birth of Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahari. Hatshepsut had used the birth story to reinforce her claims to the throne. Amenhotep was the son of a ruling pharaoh and it seems that the birth scene is used to stress the semi-divine nature of Amenhotep III. In a key scene Mutemwiya is shown seated on a bed receiving the god Amun who had taken the form of her husband Thutmose IV. They are in the presence of the goddesses Selket and Neith. The scenes show Amenhotep III to be the result of the union of his mother with the god Amun himself. A pregnant queen Mutemwiya as later shown being led to the birthing room by Isis and Khnum.A partial granite statue representing Mutemwiya was found in Karnak and it now is in the collection of the British Museum. The statue takes the form of a rebus showing the goddess Mut seated in a barque, thereby forming her name.

However, his reputation was not held in as high esteem when it comes to later art critics: Dezallier d'Argenville, though recognizing the ability of Van Mieris as a painter, states in his Abr\u00e9g\u00e9 that he was never able to match the level of his father, Frans van Mieris the Elder, whose fame was still celebrated in Europe when Willem painted his major works. This opinion was reflected in the foreign market as well, as this anecdote describes; Pieter de la Court van der Voort (1664\u20131739) was travelling through France in 1700, intending to sell a work by Willem van Mieris. He covered up the artist's signature to hide the fact that it was a work by Willem, not his father Frans van Mieris, as the value of the painting would be drastically lowered when it would be known that it was the son who painted it.Much harsher is the opinion of Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9, the major critic of Dutch art in the 19th century: in his Mus\u00e9es de la Hollande, a catalogue of the most important works of art exposed in the Netherlands, the French connoisseur blatantly despised Willem van Mieris, labeling his paintings as \"harsh, cold, piddling, and unsurpassably insipid\".

In fact, the French critic idealized Dutch 17th-century painting as the most complete expression of freedom and independence ever achieved by European art, with Rembrandt and Vermeer as icons of a popular, real and truthful way of painting.

However, Viken and its region of Norway, Vestfold, were not parts of Harald I's dominions but subject to the Danish kings at the time, making this connection dubious.  Further, the future king Olaf is said to have been born posthumously to a mother who had taken refuge in the Orkney Islands, yet the age assigned him in other sources would place his birth years after the date attributed to the death of his father.  The Heimskringla then relates that he was enslaved in Estonia as a three-year-old, only to tell his true parentage to the man who discovered him there and freed him six years later. Olaf II is likewise claimed to have been a male-line descendant of Harald I, as great-grandson of Harald I's alleged son Bj\u00f8rn in Vestfold, yet he is first known to history as a successful Viking marauder rather than a landed prince. The reliability of these two claims depends on the credibility of the Icelandic accounts (in particular Heimskringla) and the sources used to compile them, and if deemed unreliable, their reigns would represent distinct dynasties from that of Fairhair.\nHarald III is historically attested to have referred only to his kinship with his maternal half-brother, Olaf II. Much later legends (sagas authored under the patronage of royal courts of Harald III's descendants) claim Harald III's father also to have descended from Harald I (through Harald Fairhair's alleged son Sigurd Hrise).  Thus, Harald III's 'Hardrada dynasty' is represented in the sagas as a branch of the Fairhair dynasty. They also became known as the 'St. Olaf dynasty' in honor of the founder's half-brother.\nHarald IV arrived in Norway from his native Ireland and claimed to be the natural son of Magnus III, sired during the latter's Irish expedition. His claim seems, from historical sources, to be based on tales told by his Irish mother and family circle during his youth.  Were one to view these claims as dubious, then Harald IV instead gave rise to a new dynasty, the 'Gille' (Irish) or 'Gylle dynasty'.\nThe most seriously discredited alleged scion, practically regarded as an impostor by many modern academics, was Sverre I, who arrived in Norway from his native Faroe Islands, took up leadership in the embattled and heirless Birkebeiner party of the civil war, and claimed to be the natural son of Sigurd II by Gunhild, Sverre's attested mother. Sverre was sired during his mother's marriage with another man, Unas the Combmaker. Only in adulthood, so the claim goes according to legends, did his mother tell Sverre his 'real' paternity. Based on historical sources, no one else appears to have given the story credence. During that stage of the civil war, the strife was so intense that genealogical truth had evolved to a relative concept. Many royal pretenders claimed to be sons of King Sigurd II, and that was mostly a political statement \u2013 their claims were at best dubious. It may have meant just that the claimant desired to continue the perceived policies of Sigurd and his party, and in that sense were his 'sons'. Sverre I would be viewed as starting the Sverre dynasty.\nHaakon IV was born to a Norwegian peasant girl after the death of King Haakon III. She and the late king's inner circle affirmed that she had been the king's lover and that the boy had been sired by him. Of all the last-mentioned four problematic points of descent, this appears, on the face of it, as the most trustworthy. Were this disputed, Haakon IV, would be regarded as having started yet another new dynasty, though he is generally regarded as having continued the 'Sverre dynasty'.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Police officer Bo hopes to arrest Victor for his many crimes. When he nearly shoots Victor, Caroline suddenly reveals that Bo is Victor's son, the product of a secret affair. Though Bo hates Victor, he agrees to allow Victor into his life as a means to protect Caroline from him. Seeing how tormented Bo is by the truth, Victor eventually pretends to have had a vasectomy in the past so that Bo can believe that Shawn is actually his father.\nCaroline and Shawn adopt orphaned brothers Frankie and Max around 1987. Kayla is wrongly arrested for the murder of Marina Toscano in 1989, and Caroline makes a false confession in order to save her. Kayla is convicted anyway and gives birth to her daughter Stephanie in prison in 1990, though she is ultimately exonerated. That year Shawn and Caroline also meet Dr. Carly Manning, who soon becomes involved with Bo after the presumed death of his wife Hope. Kayla's husband Steve Johnson is also presumed dead in 1990; Caroline is furious when Kayla becomes involved with Kim's ex Shane Donovan, and when Kim romances the sinister Lawrence Alamain.

Marlena is revealed to be the serial killer and murders a few other people before being killed herself. After her burial, Marlena awakens in Melaswen, a copy of Salem built on a remote tropical island by the villainous Tony DiMera. Caroline and all of Marlena's \"victims\" are alive and living there as captives, Tony having faked their deaths and manipulated a drugged Marlena. As everyone tries to escape, Tony initiates a volcanic eruption that itself causes a tsunami to strike the island. Some people are saved, but Caroline and Victor are among those presumed dead. They later appear as captives at a European castle, and are rescued in August 2005; in 2007 it is revealed that Tony's cousin Andr\u00e9 DiMera had been impersonating him during that time.\nCaroline is devastated in 2008 when Shawn dies; he had given Bo his oxygen mask as their sabotaged plane was going down. Caroline continues running the Brady Pub with the help of her returned son Max, who learns that his biological father is Salem University Dean Trent Robbins. Max is soon furious with the unsavory Trent, whom Caroline warns away from Max.

{"id": "40_249", "question": "Who is Cyclops's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_69292", "text": "Cyclops has had multiple serious relationships and is rarely written without a romantic female relationship. Cyclops' relationships are particularly complicated because of the many retcons involved in the publication history of the Jean Grey and Madelyne Pryor characters.\nIn terms of publication time, Cyclops's longest and deepest romantic relationship would be with Jean Grey, whom he would eventually marry but not before she would appear to tragically die protecting the X-Men. Grieving from this loss, Scott leaves to the Summers family reunion where he meets and starts to pursue Madelyne Pryor. Scott would become obsessed with Madelyne's similarity to Jean. Madelyne turns out to be a clone of Jean and becomes a supervillain but not before Scott marries Madelyne and has a child with her. A romantic love triangle would later be created when Jean was reawakened from a coma and brought back to life by the Fantastic Four. These relationships would be resolved over the duration of Cyclops's appearance in the X-Factor series.  Asked whether or not Cyclops was really in love with Madelyne, X-Factor writer Louise Simonson answered, \"I think she was a substitute for Jean.\" Uncanny X-Men writer Chris Claremont noted that Cyclops's love for Madelyne was genuine and intended as a means of retiring the character from the team, stating, \"It's a metaphor for us all. We all grow up. We all move on.\"Jean Grey and Scott finally marry in X-Men #30. Afterward, Scott seemed to have reached a happy ending. Subsequently, Scott becomes possessed by Apocalypse and the lingering effects from this would taint his relationship with Jean. This combined with Jean's returning Phoenix powers creates stress in their romantic relationship. Confused, Scott turns to Emma Frost, who takes advantage of Scott's emotional problems, which leads to a telepathic extramarital affair.  When confronted by Jean, Scott claims that they shared \"only thoughts\" and that he had done nothing wrong; Jean, however, disagrees and demands that Emma explain herself, but Emma only jeers and insults her. Enraged, Jean unleashes the immeasurable Phoenix ability on Emma, rifling through her memories and forcing her to confront the truth about herself.\nIn the aftermath, Scott then leaves the X-Men for a time to understand his own conflicting feelings. He returns to tell Emma that he had made a decision between her and Jean, but Jean is killed in battle before it is revealed which woman he had picked. After Jean's death, Scott feels disillusioned with Xavier's dream, leaves the X-Men, and refuses Emma's offer to reopen the school. Had the school remained closed, this outcome would have led to an apocalyptic future. To avoid it, Jean, who was resurrected in this apocalyptic future, used her Phoenix abilities to absorb this future timeline into the White Hot Room. She then mentally pushed Scott past the guilt he felt over her death and made him accept Emma's offer of reopening the school with her.\nThe two have since been together, although not without problems, particularly in light of the \"House of M\" storyline in which Emma alienates herself from many people by completely reformatting the school's workings and the events involving the Hellfire Club's return. As of the Divided We Stand stories, their relationship seems to be back on track. The relationship begins to deteriorate again with Cyclops keeping secrets about the actions of X-Force, and Emma not telling him of her agreement to join Norman Osborn's secret alliance known as the Cabal. However, both had their secrets revealed to each other and their romantic relationship seems to be back on track once again, apparently stronger and closer than ever.A wedge is driven between Scott and Emma's relationship during the war with the Avengers, with Emma and the other members of the Phoenix Five becoming more and more corrupted by the Phoenix Force while Cyclops tries to control his portion as his allies go out of control. In the end, Scott betrays Emma by attacking her and stealing her portion of the Phoenix Force. Following the end of the war with the Avengers, Scott and Emma's relationship has ended.The time displaced version of Cyclops was in a relationship with Jean, but she ended the relationship when discovering their future. He later began a budding relationship with X-23, prior to leaving the X-Men to join his father, leaving Jean and Laura devastated. The present-day Scott was romantically approached by the time-displaced Jean at one point but he flatly stopped her advances.

(Durkin) and Luke Joseph Higgins. Her father was an Irish immigrant and her mother was American-born, also of Irish descent. The United States census gives her age in April 1940 as 12, which indicates her year of birth is 1927, as that was her age at her last birthday, the question asked by census enumerators.She was born about a year and a half after the birth of her older brother, Joseph. Her younger brother John, followed three years later. Even as a small child, she was interested in writing, composing her first poem at age seven and often crafting short plays for her friends to enact. She began keeping a journal when she was seven years old, noting in her first entry, \"Nothing much happened today.\"The family lived off the earnings from their Irish pub and were fairly well-off, owning a home in the Bronx and a summer cottage on Long Island Sound. Although the Great Depression began when Higgins Clark was still a baby, her family was initially not affected, and even insisted on feeding the men who knocked on their door looking for work. By the time Higgins Clark was ten, however, the family began to experience financial trouble, as many of their customers were unable to pay the bar tabs they had run up. Higgins Clark's father was forced to lay off several employees and work longer hours, spending no more than a few hours at home each day. The family was thrown into further turmoil in 1939, when young Mary returned home from an early Mass to discover that her father had died in his sleep.Nora Higgins, now a widow with three young children to support, soon discovered that few employers were willing to hire a 52-year-old woman who had not held a job in over fourteen years. To pay the bills, Higgins Clark was forced to move out of her bedroom so that her mother could rent it out to paying boarders. Six months after their father's death, Higgins Clark's older brother cut his foot on a piece of metal and contracted severe osteomyelitis. Higgins Clark and her mother prayed constantly for him, and their neighbors came en masse to give blood for the many transfusions the young boy needed. Despite the dire predictions of the doctors, Joseph Higgins survived. Higgins Clark credits his recovery to the power of their prayers.When Higgins Clark graduated from Saint Francis Xavier Grammar School, she received a scholarship to continue her education at the Villa Maria Academy, a school run by the nuns of the Congregation de Notre Dame de Montreal. There, the principal and other teachers encouraged Higgins Clark to develop her writing, although they were somewhat less than pleased when she began spending her class time writing stories instead of paying attention to the lesson. At sixteen, Higgins Clark made her first attempt at publishing her work, sending an entry to True Confessions, which was rejected.To help pay the bills, she worked as a switchboard operator at the Shelton Hotel, where she often listened in to the residents' conversations. In her memoir she recalls spending much time eavesdropping on Tennessee Williams but complained that he never said anything interesting. On her days off, Higgins Clark would window shop, mentally choosing the clothes she would wear when she finally became a famous writer.Despite Higgins Clark's contribution to the family finances, the money her mother earned babysitting was not enough, and the family lost their house and moved into a small three-room apartment. When Joseph graduated from high school in 1944, he immediately enlisted in the Navy, both to serve his country during war and to help his mother pay her bills. Six months after his enlistment he contracted spinal meningitis and died. Although the family mourned Joseph's death deeply, as his dependent, Nora was guaranteed a life pension and no longer needed her daughter's help to pay the bills.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Maybelle helped create the group's unique sound with her innovative style of guitar playing, using her thumb to play the melody on the bass strings and her index finger to fill out the rhythm. Her technique, sometimes known as the Carter Scratch, influenced the guitar's shift from rhythm to lead instrument.The Grand Ole Opry community of the early 1950s widely respected her, a matriarchal figure in country music circles who was popularly known as \"Mother Maybelle.\" However, she was only in her forties.

With his radically innovative and avante garde stage productions, Reinhardt is regarded as one of the most prominent stage directors of the early 20th century. \nFor example, Reinhardt's 1917 stage premiere of Reinhard Sorge's Kleist Prize-winning stage play Der Bettler almost single-handedly gave birth to Expressionism in the theatre and ultimately in motion pictures as well. In 1920, Reinhardt established the Salzburg Festival by directing an open air production of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's acclaimed adaptation of the Everyman Medieval mystery play in the square before the Cathedral with the Alps as a background. This remains an annual custom at the Salzburg Festival to this day.\nToby Cole and Helen Krich Chinoy have dubbed Reinhardt, \"one of the most picturesque actor-directors of modern times\", and write that his eventual arrival in the United States as a refugee from the imminent Nazi takeover of Austria followed a long and distinguished career, \"inspired by the example of social participation in the ancient Greek and Medieval theatres\", of seeking, \"to bridge the separation between actors and audiences\".In 1935, Reinhardt directed his first and only motion picture in the United States through Warner Brothers, the Expressionist film adaptation of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, starring Mickey Rooney, Olivia De Havilland, and James Cagney. The film was banned by the Ministry of Propaganda in an infamous example of censorship in Nazi Germany. This was due not only to Joseph Goebbels' belief that Expressionism was degenerate art, but even more so due to the Jewish ancestry of director Max Reinhardt, Classical music composer Felix Mendelsohn, and soundtrack arranger Erich Wolfgang Korngold; whose work was already banned by Goebbels as allegedly degenerate music.Reinhardt also founded the highly influential drama schools Hochschule f\u00fcr Schauspielkunst \"Ernst Busch\" in Berlin, Max Reinhardt Seminar, the Max Reinhardt Workshop (Sunset Boulevard), and the Max Reinhardt Junior Workshop. Even though Reinhardt did not live long enough to witness the end of Nazism in 1945, his formerly expropriated estate at Schloss Leopoldskron near Salzburg was restored to his widow and his legacy continues to be celebrated and honoured in the modern Germanosphere for his many radically innovative contributions to the performing arts.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "40_278", "question": "Who is Abbas II's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_69422", "text": "Abbas II succeeded his father, Tewfik Pasha, as Khedive of Egypt and Sudan on 8 January 1892.  He was still in college in Vienna when he assumed the throne of the Khedivate of Egypt upon the sudden death of his father. He was barely of age according to Egyptian law; normally eighteen in cases of succession to the throne. For some time he did not willingly cooperate with the British, whose army had occupied Egypt in 1882. As he was young and eager to exercise his new power, he resented the interference of the British Agent and Consul General in Cairo, Sir Evelyn Baring, later made Lord Cromer. Lord Cromer initially supported Abbas but the new Khedive's nationalist agenda and association with anti-colonial Islamist movements put him in direct conflict with British colonial officers, and Cromer later interceded on behalf of Lord Kitchener (British commander in the Sudan) in an ongoing dispute with Abbas about Egyptian sovereignty and influence in that territory.At the outset of his reign, Khedive Abbas II surrounded himself with a coterie of European advisers who opposed the British occupation of Egypt and Sudan and encouraged the young khedive to challenge Cromer by replacing his ailing prime minister with an Egyptian nationalist. At Cromer's behest, Lord Rosebery, the British Foreign Secretary, sent Abbas II a letter stating that the Khedive was obliged to consult the British consul on such issues as cabinet appointments. In January 1894 Abbas II made an inspection tour of Sudanese and Egyptian frontier troops stationed near the southern border, the Mahdists being at the time still in control of the Sudan. At Wadi Halfa the Khedive made public remarks disparaging the Egyptian army units commanded by British officers. The British Sirdar of the Egyptian army, Sir Herbert Kitchener, immediately threatened to resign. Kitchener further insisted on the dismissal of a nationalist under-secretary of war appointed by Abbas II and that an apology be made for the Khedive's criticism of the army and its officers.By 1899 he had come to accept British counsels. Also in 1899, British diplomat Alfred Mitchell-Innes was appointed Under-Secretary of State for Finance in Egypt, and in 1900 Abbas II paid a second visit to Britain, during which he said he thought the British had done good work in Egypt, and declared himself ready to cooperate with the British officials administering Egypt and Sudan. He gave his formal approval for the establishment of a sound system of justice for Egyptian nationals, a significant reduction in taxation, increased affordable and sound education, the inauguration of the substantial irrigation works such as the Aswan Low Dam and the Assiut Barrage, and the reconquest of Sudan. He displayed more interest in agriculture than in statecraft. His farm of cattle and horses at Qubbah, near Cairo, was a model for agricultural science in Egypt, and he created a similar establishment at Muntazah, just east of Alexandria. He married the Princess Ikbal Hanem and had several children. Muhammad Abdul Moneim, the heir-apparent, was born on 20 February 1899.\nAlthough Abbas II no longer publicly opposed the British, he secretly created, supported and sustained the Egyptian nationalist movement, which came to be led by Mustafa Kamil Pasha. He also funded the anti-British newspaper Al-Mu'ayyad. As Kamil's thrust was increasingly aimed at winning popular support for a nationalist political party, Khedive Abbas publicly distanced himself from the Nationalists and was labeled as being against Islam by said nationalists. The western world would characterize him as a revolutionary against peace, although his main goal was to gain independence for Morocco. Their demand for a constitutional government in 1906 was rebuffed by Abbas II, and the following year he formed the National Party, led by Mustafa Kamil Pasha, to counter the Ummah Party of the Egyptian moderates. However, in general, he had no real political power. When the Egyptian Army was sent to fight Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi in Sudan in 1896, he only found out about it because the Austro-Hungarian Archduke Francis Ferdinand was in Egypt and told him after being informed of it by a British Army officer.His relations with Cromer's successor, Sir Eldon Gorst, however, were excellent, and they co-operated in appointing the cabinets headed by Butrus Ghali in 1908 and Muhammad Sa'id in 1910 and in checking the power of the National Party. The appointment of Kitchener to succeed Gorst in 1912 displeased Abbas II, and relations between the Khedive and the British deteriorated. Kitchener, who exiled or imprisoned the leaders of the National Party, often complained about \"that wicked little Khedive\" and wanted to depose him.\nOn 25 July 1914, at the onset of World War I, Abbas II was in Constantinople and was wounded in his hands and cheeks during a failed assassination attempt. On 5 November 1914 when Great Britain declared war on the Ottoman Empire, he was accused of deserting Egypt by not promptly returning home. The British also believed that he was plotting against their rule, as he had attempted to appeal to Egyptians and Sudanese to support the Central Powers against the British. So when the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in World War I, the United Kingdom declared Egypt a Sultanate under British protection on 18 December 1914 and deposed Abbas II.\nDuring the war, Abbas II sought support from the Ottomans, including proposing to lead an attack on the Suez Canal. He was replaced by the British by his uncle Hussein Kamel from 1914 to 1917, with the title of Sultan of Egypt. Hussein Kamel issued a series of restrictive orders to strip Abbas II of property in Egypt and Sudan and forbade contributions to him. These also barred Abbas from entering Egyptian territory and stripped him of the right to sue in Egyptian courts. This did not prevent his progeny, however, from exercising their rights. Abbas II finally accepted the new order on 12 May 1931 and formally abdicated. He retired to Switzerland, where he wrote The Anglo-Egyptian Settlement (1930). He died at Geneva on 19 December 1944, aged 70, 30 years to the day after the end of his reign as Khedive.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to William of Malmesbury, \u00c6thelstan stood godfather to a son of  Constantine at the Church of Dacre. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dates the meeting of \u00c6thelstan with the northern kings at Eamont to the 12 July 927. So, it is likely that this baptism occurred on, or around, the Feast of St Hildulf, which Alex Woolf suggests may be the source of his uncommon name. John of Fordun and others supposed that Indulf had been king of Strathclyde in the reign of his predecessor, based on their understanding that the kingdom of Strathclyde had become a part of the kingdom of Alba in the 940s. This, however, is no longer accepted.The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: \"In his time oppidum Eden\", usually identified as Edinburgh, \"was evacuated, and abandoned to the Scots until the present day.\" This has been read as indicating that Lothian, or some large part of it, fell to Indulf at this time. However, the conquest of Lothian is likely to have been a process rather than a single event, and the frontier between the lands of the kings of Alba and Bernicia may have lain south and east of Edinburgh many years before Indulf's reign.Indulf's death is reported by the Chronicon Scotorum in 962, the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba adding that he was killed fighting Vikings near Cullen, at the Battle of Bauds. The Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n, however, claims that he died \"in the house of the same holy apostle, where his father [died]\", that is at the c\u00e9li d\u00e9 monastery of St Andrews.

Plautus, the Roman comedian, used this tale to present Amphitryon, a burlesque play. The dramatic treatment by Plautus has enjoyed a sustaining presence on the stage since its premiere. It was the only play by Plautus that was still performed during the Middle Ages, albeit in a modified form. It was staged regularly during the Renaissance, and was the second ancient comedy to be translated into the English language.\nPlautus' play inspired several other theatrical works during the 16th century, including three Spanish language plays, two Italian plays, and a comedy in Portuguese by Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es. In 1636 Jean Rotrou translated Plautus' work into a successful French language production, Les Deux Sosies. This work inspired Moli\u00e8re's highly successful Amphitryon (1668).  From Moli\u00e8re's line \"Le v\u00e9ritable Amphitryon est l'Amphitryon o\u00f9 l'on d\u00eene,\" the name Amphitryon has come to be used in the sense of a generous entertainer, a good host; the Spanish word for \"host\" is in fact \"anfitri\u00f3n\" and in Portuguese it is \"anfitri\u00e3o\". Several other continental versions inspired by Plautus followed Moli\u00e8re, including a Christianized version by Johannes Burmeister.\nThe first English language work that was loosely based on Plautus was an interlude in Jacke Juggler (ca. 1550). John Marston's What You Will (1607) was also partly based on Plautus. The first large scale work where Plautus was the chief source was Thomas Heywood's The Silver Age (1613). John Dryden's 1690 Amphitryon is based on Moli\u00e8re's 1668 version as well as on Plautus.  Notable innovations from Dryden's adaptation include music by Henry Purcell and the character of Phaedra, who flirts with Sosia but is eventually won over by Mercury's promises of wealth. A modern comic adaptation was made by George Maxim Ross in the 1950s under the title Too Much Amphitryon.\nIn Germany, Heinrich von Kleist's Amphitryon (1807), which began as a translation of Moli\u00e8re's Amphitryon (1668) but developed into an original adaptation of the myth in its own right, remains the most frequently performed version of the myth, with Kleist using Alkmene's inability to distinguish between Jupiter and her husband to explore metaphysical issues; Giselher Klebe wrote in 1961 his opera Alkmene based on this play. Other German dramatic treatments include Georg Kaiser's posthumously published Double Amphitryon (Zweimal Amphitryon, 1943) and Peter Hacks's Amphitryon (1968).\nIn France, Moli\u00e8re's Amphitryon (1668) is the most famous and seminal treatment of the myth. It was also the subject of a play by Jean Giraudoux, Amphitryon 38 (1929), the number in the title being Giraudoux's whimsical approximation of how many times the story had been told onstage previously. It was adapted into English by S. N. Behrman and enjoyed a successful run on Broadway in 1938.  Plautus' version was the basis of Cole Porter's 1950 musical Out of This World. In 1991 it was the basis for the Jean-Luc Godard film H\u00e9las pour moi.\nThe classic 1935 Nazi-era but anti-Nazi film version, Amphitryon, was based on Kleist.\nThe comic opera Amfitrion by the Croatia composer Boris Papandopulo (composed in 1937) which premiered in 1940.\nThe musical Olympus on My Mind is based on Kleist's adaptation of the play.\nIrish author John Banville's play God's Gift (Gallery Books, 2000) is a version of Kleist's Amphitryon.\nThe late Mexican writer Ignacio Padilla's novel Amphitryon (2000), is a loose retelling of the ancient myth set in Nazi Germany and Europe, largely exploring the complex subjects of identity, time, and memory.

According to the Shoku Nihongi (\u7d9a\u65e5\u672c\u7d00), Yamabe's mother, Yamato no Niigasa (later called Takano no Niigasa), was a 10th generation descendant of Muryeong of Baekje (462-523).After his father became emperor, Kammu's half-brother, Prince Osabe was appointed to the rank of crown prince. His mother was Princess Inoe, a daughter of Emperor Sh\u014dmu; but instead of Osabe, it was Kammu who was later named to succeed their father. After Inoe and Prince Osabe were confined and then died in 775, Osabe's sister \u2013 Kammu's half-sister Princess Sakahito \u2013 became Kammu's wife. Later, when he ascended to the throne in 781, Kammu appointed his young brother, Prince Sawara, whose mother was Takano no Niigasa, as crown prince. Hikami no Kawatsugu, a son of Emperor Tenmu's grandson Prince Shioyaki and Sh\u014dmu's daughter Fuwa, attempted to carry out a coup d'\u00e9tat in 782, but it failed and Kawatsugu and his mother were sent into exile. In 785 Sawara was expelled and died in exile.\nThe Nara period saw the appointment of the first sh\u014dgun, \u014ctomo no Otomaro by Emperor Kammu in 794 CE. The sh\u014dgun was the military dictator of Japan with near absolute power over territories via the military. Otomaro was declared \"Sei-i Taish\u014dgun\" which means \"Barbarian-subduing Great General\". Emperor Kammu granted the second title of sh\u014dgun to Sakanoue no Tamuramaro for subduing the Emishi in northern Honshu.Kammu had 16 empresses and consorts, and 32 imperial sons and daughters.

Billed as being 6 foot 9 inches and over 300 pounds, Windham was a raw-boned cowboy in the vein of Bobby Duncum or Stan Hansen.\nIn November and December 1970, Windham (as \"Bob Windham\") wrestled in Japan for the International Wrestling Enterprise promotion as part of its Big Winter Series. Teaming with Larry Hennig, he defeated Great Kusatsu and Thunder Sugiyama in a two-out-of-three falls match to win the IWA World Tag Team Championship. Kusatsu and Sugiyama regained the titles from them several weeks later.In 1971, Mulligan joined the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) where he was transformed into \"Blackjack Mulligan\". Mulligan donned black trunks, black hat, a black fingerless glove, moustache and used the iron claw submission hold.\nWhen he arrived in the WWWF, he was managed by The Grand Wizard. Early stills of the two actually identify him as \"Big Bob Windham\". Mulligan went on to great success in the Northeast and was an early challenger to newly crowned champion Pedro Morales. His push was interrupted when he was slashed in the thigh by a fan at the Boston Garden and required hundreds of stitches to close the wound. The culprit was actually captured by Gorilla Monsoon, who threw him at the ringside police \u2013 who promptly let him go because they thought \"it was part of the show\".\nBefore he left to recover from his wound, Mulligan participated in a Madison Square Garden match against Bruno Sammartino, who was making his first appearance at the arena since the end of his nearly eight-year championship reign. Mulligan attacked Sammartino before the bell. Sammartino quickly recovered, slammed Mulligan twice and pinned him in 64 seconds. In wrestling terms, everybody \"got over\" \u2013 the building was sold out to the delight of promoter Vincent J. McMahon, Sammartino made a strong return to New York and Mulligan, who was in no condition to work an actual match, received a large pay-off to aid his recovery.\nOnce he healed, Mulligan returned to the Midwest and tagged with Blackjack Lanza to form the Blackjacks. Although Mulligan was the much bigger star, the duo went on to capture numerous tag team championships in various NWA affiliated promotions as well as the WWWF World Tag Team Championship in August 1975.\n\nBlackjack returned to singles wrestling in the Jim Crockett Promotions where he would go on to hold the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship and the Mid-Atlantic's version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Ric Flair.\nMulligan often battled Andr\u00e9 the Giant, feuding in many different regions in the early 1980s. When they brought their feud to the WWF (formerly the WWWF) in 1982, Windham was noted as saying Andre had no limit to his strength. Mulligan then wrestled in Florida. He often teamed with West Texas stars Dusty Rhodes, Dick Murdoch, and his son Barry Windham. Mulligan returned to the WWF as a full-time performer in 1984, hosting an interview segment titled Blackjack's Barbecue on WWF All-Star Wrestling, the counterpart to Roddy Piper's Piper's Pit.\nIn 1986, Mulligan wrestled under a mask as \"Big Machine\", part of a team with \"The Giant Machine\" (Andr\u00e9 the Giant) and \"Super Machine\" (Bill Eadie) collectively known as The Machines. They won several high-profile matches against the Heenan family, later recruiting members such as 'Hulk Machine' and 'Piper Machine'. After that angle ended, Mulligan wrestled for the WWF as himself, until he finally left in 1987.

In 406, Tufa Rutan attacked Northern Liang but after Juqu Mengxun refused to engage him, withdrew, and he made a tribute of 3,000 horses and 30,000 cattle to Yao Xing, greatly touching Yao Xing and making him believing in Tufa Rutan's loyalty, and so he commissioned Tufa Rutan with governorship of Liang Province (\u6dbc\u5dde, at that time only Guzang and its surroundings), giving him Guzang.  Later that year, Tufa Rutan moved his capital from Ledu to Guzang.  He also entered into an alliance with Western Li\u00e1ng's duke Li Gao, aimed against Northern Liang.\nWhile Tufa Rutan was nominally a Later Qin vassal, he did not actually wish to serve Yao Xing long, and in 407 he proposed to Qifu Chipan (who had then temporarily taken over his father Qifu Gangui's troops, since Qifu Gangui was detained at the Later Qin capital Chang'an) an alliance, but Qifu Chipan executed his messengers and delivered their heads to Yao Xing.  Still, at this time, Southern Liang's power was at its apex.\nAt this time, though, a major defeat would cause Southern Liang's strength to begin to wane.  In winter 407, the Later Qin rebel Liu Bobo, who had earlier that year broken from Later Qin and established Xia, requested to marry Tufa Rutan's daughter.  Tufa Rutan refused, and in anger Liu Bobo launched a punitive raid against Southern Liang but then retreated.  Tufa Rutan gave chase and, believing that he greatly outpowered Liu Bobo, was careless in his military actions.  Liu Bobo led him into a canyon and then blocked the exit with ice and wagons, and then ambushed him\u2014and the defeat was such that it was said that 60% to 70% of Southern Liang's famed officials and generals died in the battle.  Tufa Rutan barely escaped capture.  In fear, Tufa Rutan ordered that all of the people within 150 kilometers of Guzang be moved into the capital, which immediately led to mass panic and a rebellion by the Xiongnu chief Cheng Qi'er (\u6210\u4e03\u5152).  While Cheng's rebellion was defeated, Tufa Rutan's domain had been greatly wounded.\nIn light of Tufa Rutan's defeat, Yao Xing plotted his destruction, despite the advice of Wei Zong (\u97cb\u5b97), an official of his who had personal knowledge of Tufa Rutan's ability, against such action.  In 408, he commissioned his son Yao Bi (\u59da\u5f3c) the Duke of Guangping to lead a large force with generals Lian Cheng (\u6582\u6210) and Qifu Gangui to make a surprise attack on Southern Liang\u2014tricking Tufa Rutan into initially not resisting by informing him that the army was intended to be part of a pincer movement against Xia.  Only when the Later Qin forces reached Guzang's vicinity did Tufa Rutan realize what the purpose of the campaign was, and he defended the city against Yao Bi.  When a rebellion inside the city itself, led by Wang Zhong (\u738b\u937e), threatened to cause the city to fall, Tufa Rutan buried some 5,000 people alive, and he then defeated Yao Bi.  When Yao Xing sent Yao Xian (\u59da\u986f) the Duke of Changshan to aid Yao Bi, Tufa Rutan defeated him as well, and Yao Xian, in fear, blamed Lian for the entire campaign and apologized to Tufa Rutan, and then withdrew with Yao Bi.  Tufa Rutan also sent a messenger to Chang'an to request forgiveness.\nIn winter 408, Tufa Rutan again declared independence, and claimed the title of Prince of Liang, in light of Later Qin's defeats at his own hands and at the hands of Liu Bobo.  He created his wife Lady Zhejue princess, and his son Tufa Hutai (\u79bf\u9aee\u864e\u53f0) crown prince.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Abbas the Great was succeeded by his grandson, Safi. A reclusive and passive character, Safi was unable to fill the power vacuum which his grandfather had left behind. His officials undermined his authority and revolts constantly broke out across the realm. The continuing war with the Ottoman Empire, started with initial success during Abbas the Great's reign, but ended with the humiliating defeat of Iran and the Treaty of Zuhab, which returned much of Iran's conquests in Mesopotamia to the Ottomans.In order to assert his authority, Safi purged every potential claimant to his throne, including the sons of the Safavid princesses, and the sons of Abbas the Great, who were blinded and thus were unqualified to rule. The purge also saw the deaths of the leading figures of the realm. An example of Safi's cruelty occurred on the night of 20 February 1632, also known as the bloody Ma'bas, in which he had forty females of the harem put to death. The last act of his bloodshed was the killing of his grand vizier, Mirza Taleb Khan, who was replaced with a ghulam (military slave) named Mirza Mohammad Taqi Khan, more famously known as Saru Taqi.As a eunuch, Saru Taqi had access to the royal harem, and used this ability to forge relations with the shah's concubines. He influenced Safi, persuading him to increase the royal domains by passing the Fars province to the crown demesne. He imposed heavy taxes throughout the realm, especially on Isfahan's Armenian population, and investigated the revenue flows of the previous governor of Gilan. He was described as greedy and was accused by Western observers of accepting bribes. In 1634, Saru Taqi appointed his brother, Mohammad Saleh Beg, as the governor of Mazandaran to counteract the Mar'ashi Sayyid line. Saru Taqi's family held the province's governorship until the end of Safi's reign.Safi died from excessive drinking on 12 May 1642, leaving behind a country smaller than it was when he inherited it. A weak-minded man lacking charisma, Safi manifested many problems that later plagued the Safavid empire during its decline, one of them being not preparing the crown prince for rule. He excluded the Qizilbash influence in Safavid bureaucracy, and instead allowed a coalition of concubines, eunuchs and ghulams to hold power during the last decade of his reign.", "hasanswer": true}]}

After the death of his father, he became the head of the Mamikonian noble family. In 420, he went to Constantinople with Mesrop Mashtots and was appointed stratelates (general) of Byzantine Armenia by Theodosius II. In 422, he returned to Vagharshapat, then went to Ctesiphon, where Sasanian king Bahram V recognized him as sparapet of the Kingdom of Armenia; the office of sparapet, the supreme commander of the Armenian armed forces, was held hereditarily by the Mamikonian family. Vardan retained this title after the abolition of the Kingdom of Armenia in 428.Conditions worsened in Sasanian Armenia with the accession of Yazdegerd II in 439. At first, Yazdegerd and his officials imposed heavier taxes and obligations on Armenia and its nobility, but did not yet openly move against the Armenian Church. In 442, Yazdegerd sent the Armenian cavalry commanded by Vardan east to fight the Huns. In 449, the Sasanian king issued an edict officially imposing Zoroastrianism on Armenia. That same year, the Armenian elite gathered at Artaxata under the presidency of marzpan Vasak Siwni, Vardan, the bidaxsh of the Iberia March, and the acting Catholicos of Armenia to declare their loyalty to the Sasanian state and their Christian faith. Yazdegerd did not accept this decision and summoned the Armenian magnates (nakharars) to Ctesiphon and forced them to convert to Zoroastrianism. Yazdegerd released most of the nobles after an unexpected attack from the east and sent magi to convert Armenia.Upon their return to Armenia, Vardan and most of the Armenian nobles repudiated their conversion, although Yeghishe and Ghazar Parpetsi give conflicting accounts of Vardan's initial apostasy and the origins of the Armenian rebellion that broke out in 450. Vardan may have initially intended to retire into exile, but soon emerged as the leader the popular rebellion against the imposition of Zoroastrianism. Vardan and his allies made a solemn oath and captured a number of fortresses and settlements. Vardan's forces won a major victory over the Persians in the summer of 450 and secured an alliance with the northern Huns; however, an embassy to Byzantium asking for aid was unsuccessful. Vardan was opposed by a significant pro-Persian party of Armenian nobles, and marzpan Vasak Siwni refused to follow him out of Armenia to meet the Persians in battle.In the summer of 451, a large Sasanian army including the elite cavalry corps of the Immortals and war elephants marched against the Armenian rebels. Vardan's army battled with the Persians at Avarayr near Maku on June 2. The supporters of Vasak Siwni deserted during the battle and Vardan's forces were defeated, with Vardan and most of the Armenian nobility dying in the fighting. The aftermath of the Battle of Avarayr is not completely clear, but it appears that Yazdegerd, alarmed by the Persian losses, withdrew his troops and imprisoned Vasak Siwni. Vardan's surviving supporters were imprisoned in Iran, although many of them were eventually released in the following years. In 481, a new rebellion manifested under the leadership of Vardan's nephew, Vahan Mamikonian, which succeeded in securing recognition of Armenian religious rights and autonomy with the Treaty of Nvarsak in 484.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Atreus did so, and Helios reversed his normal course, in anger over Thyestes' actions.Atreus then learned of Thyestes' and Aerope's adultery and plotted revenge. He killed Thyestes' sons and cooked them, save their hands and heads. He served Thyestes his own sons and then taunted him with their hands and heads. This is the source of modern phrase \"Thyestean feast\", meaning one at which human flesh is served. When Thyestes was done with his feast, he released a loud belch, which represents satiety and pleasure and his loss of self-control.\nAn oracle then advised Thyestes that, if he had a son with his own daughter Pelopia, that son would kill Atreus. Thyestes did so by raping Pelopia (his identity hidden from her) and the son, Aegisthus, did kill Atreus. However, when Aegisthus was first born, he was abandoned by his mother, ashamed of the origin of her son. A shepherd found the infant Aegisthus and gave him to Atreus, who raised him as his own son. Only as he entered adulthood did Thyestes reveal the truth to Aegisthus, that he was both father and grandfather to the boy and that Atreus was his uncle. Aegisthus then killed Atreus.\nWhile Thyestes ruled Mycenae, the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus, were exiled to Sparta. There, King Tyndareus accepted them as the royalty that they were. Shortly after, he helped the brothers return to Mycenae to overthrow Thyestes, forcing him to live in Kythira, where he died.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was the third son of Charlemagne by his wife Hildegard. He had a twin brother named Lothair, who died young. Louis and Lothair were given names from the old Merovingian dynasty, possibly to suggest a connection.Louis was crowned King of Aquitaine as a three-year-old child in 781. In the following year he was sent to Aquitaine accompanied by regents and a court. Charlemagne constituted this sub-kingdom in order to secure the border of his realm after the destructive war against the Aquitanians and Basques under Waifar (capitulated c. 768) and later Hunald II, which culminated in the disastrous Battle of Roncesvalles (778). Charlemagne wanted Louis to grow up in the area where he was to reign. However, wary of the customs his son may have been assimilating into in Aquitaine, Charlemagne, who had remarried to Fastrada after the death of Hildegard, sent for Louis in 785. Louis presented himself in Saxony at the royal Council of Paderborn dressed in Basque costumes along with other youths in the same garment, which may have made a good impression in Toulouse, since the Basques of Vasconia were a mainstay of the Aquitanian army.In 794, Charlemagne gave four former Gallo-Roman villas to Louis, in the thought that he would take in each in turn as winter residence: Dou\u00e9, Ebreuil, Angeac and the Chasseneuil. Charlemagne's intention was to see all his sons brought up as natives of their given territories, wearing the national costume of the region and ruling by the local customs. Thus were the children sent to their respective realms at a young age. The marches\u2014peripheral principalities\u2014played a vital role as bulwarks against exterior threats to the empire. Louis reigned over the Spanish March. In 797, Barcelona, the largest city of the Marca, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against C\u00f3rdoba and, failing, handed it to them. The C\u00f3rdoban authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis marched the entire army of his kingdom, including Gascons with their duke Sancho I of Gascony, Proven\u00e7als under Leibulf, and Goths under Bera, over the Pyrenees and besieged it for seven months, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. King Louis was formally invested with his armour in 791 at the age of fourteen. However, the princes were not given independence from central authority as Charlemagne wished to implant in them the concepts of empire and unity by sending them on remote military expeditions. Louis joined his brother Pippin at the Mezzogiorno campaign in Italy against the Duke Grimoald of Benevento at least once.\nLouis was one of Charlemagne's three legitimate sons to survive infancy. His twin brother, Lothair, died during infancy. According to the Frankish custom of partible inheritance, Louis had expected to share his inheritance with his brothers, Charles the Younger, King of Neustria, and Pepin, King of Italy. In the Divisio Regnorum of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as ruler of the Frankish heartland of Neustria and Austrasia, while giving Pepin the Iron Crown of Lombardy, which Charlemagne possessed by conquest. To Louis's kingdom of Aquitaine, he added Septimania, Provence, and part of Burgundy. However, Charlemagne's other legitimate sons died\u2014Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811\u2014and Louis was crowned co-emperor with an already ailing Charlemagne in Aachen on 11 September 813. On his father's death in 814, he inherited the entire Carolingian Empire and all its possessions (with the sole exception of the kingdom of Italy; although within Louis's empire, in 813 Charlemagne had ordered that Bernard, Pepin's son, be made and called king).", "hasanswer": false}]}

His father was a wealthy Quaker lawyer and his mother came from a noted Colonial family.  His paternal grandfather Isaac Hopper was a Philadelphia Quaker, and conductor of the Philadelphia station of the Underground Railroad. Though his parents intended that he become a lawyer, Hopper did not enjoy that profession.:\u200a10\u200a Hopper was called Willie as a child, and then Will or Wolfie, but when he set out on an acting career he chose his more distinguished middle name as his stage name. It was modified to \"DeWolf\" because of the frequency that it was mispronounced \"Dwolf\".:\u200a9\u201310\u200aHe made his stage debut in New Haven, Connecticut, October 2, 1878. Originally, he wanted to be a serious actor, but at 6' 5\" (196 cm) and 230 pounds, he was too large for most dramatic roles. He had a loud bass singing voice, however, and made his mark in musicals, beginning in Harrigan and Hart's company.  He achieved the status of leading man in The Black Hussar (1885) and appeared in the hit Erminie in 1887. Eventually, he starred in more than thirty Broadway musicals, including Castles in the Air (1890), Wang (1891), Panjandrum (1893), John Philip Sousa's El Capitan (1896), and Reginald De Koven's Happyland. The role that he remembered with greatest pleasure was Old Bill in The Better 'Ole (1919). \n\nKnown for his comic talents, Hopper popularized many comic songs and appeared in a number of Gilbert and Sullivan comic \"patter\" roles from 1911 to 1915, including The Mikado, Patience, and H.M.S. Pinafore.A lifelong baseball enthusiast and New York Giants fan, he first performed Ernest Thayer's then-unknown poem \"Casey at the Bat\" to the Giants and Chicago Cubs the day his friend, Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Tim Keefe had his record 19-game winning streak stopped, August 14, 1888.  Hopper helped make the comic poem famous and was often called upon to give his colorful, melodramatic recitation, which he did about 10,000 times in his booming voice, reciting it during performances and as part of curtain calls, and on radio. He released a recorded version on phonograph record in 1906, and recited the poem in a short film made in the Phonofilm sound-on-film process in 1923.\n\nIt was in The Black Hussar that Hopper first incorporated a baseball theme that drew notice in the sporting press.  To accompany a song with a baseball stanza, \"Mr. Hopper enacts the pitcher, Mr. [Digby] Bell, with a bird cage on his head and boxing gloves on his hands, plays catcher, while Mme. [Mathilde] Cottrelly handles a diminutive bat as striker and endeavors to make a 'home run.'\"\nIn 1889, Hopper became founding president of the Actors' Amateur Athletic Association of America.  Back in 1886, besides organizing a regular ball team among actors, he played in a benefit game for a demented playwright.  The following year, he helped organize an actor's benefit for a sick young actress.  In the first inning, someone presented him with an eight-inch sunflower.\nAlso in 1889, Bell, Hopper and fellow McCaull Comic Opera Company actor Jefferson De Angelis were doing the following skit for their third encore in Boccaccio.  Bell returns \"with a bat in his hand, followed by DeWolf Hopper and De Angelis.  The latter has a ball, and as Hopper takes the bat in hand and Bell acts as catcher the former goes through the customary contortion act in pitching, and as Hopper hits the ball he runs off the stage, as if running the bases, and presently returns chased by De Angelis, who passes the ball to Bell as catcher just as Hopper makes a big slide for home base.  The slider tumbles Bell, and when he rises from the somersault all three yell out to the audience for judgment [a ruling], and go off kicking like Anson and [New York captain Buck] Ewing.  It is a rich gag and takes immediately\", the Brooklyn Eagle said.\nThat year, Bell called Hopper \"the biggest baseball crank that ever lived.  Physically, of course, he is a corker, but when I say big I mean big morally and intellectually.  Why, he goes up to the baseball [Polo] grounds at One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street after the matinees on Saturday, and he travels this six miles simply to see, perhaps, the two final innings, and any one can imagine the rapidity with which he must scrape off the makeup and get into his street clothes in order to secure even this much.  But he says the Garrison finishes are worth it, and he is perfectly right.  Hopper always was a baseball crank, long before the public knew anything about it.\"\nBald from childhood (he had alopecia), Hopper wore wigs both on and offstage. In later years, a reaction to harsh medicines that he took for throat problems gave his skin a bluish tinge. Regardless, his powerful voice and great sense of humor seemed an attraction to women all his life.  With an insatiable appetite for young actresses, he left a long trail of six wives and countless mistresses in his wake, he became known by the nickname \"The Husband of His Country.\"\nHopper also appeared in several silent motion pictures, two examples being Don Quixote (1915) and Casey at the Bat (1916). Hopper also appeared in a few short sound films, including one in 1923 when he actually recites Casey at the Bat in an experimental sound film produced by Lee De Forest's Phonofilm process.Hopper was a part of the Triangle Film Corporation, which he described as \u201cthe first great flourish\u201d of a \u201cprattling, infant industry\u201d.He made a Broadway appearance in White Lilacs (1928). He then did Radio City Music Hall Inaugural (1932), and played Dr. Gustave Ziska in The Monster (1933). At the time of his death, he was in Kansas City, Missouri, making a radio appearance.

The Doctor Who episode \"The Unicorn and the Wasp\" (17 May 2008) stars Fenella Woolgar as Christie, and explains her disappearance as being connected to aliens. The film Agatha and the Truth of Murder (2018) sends her undercover to solve the murder of Florence Nightingale's goddaughter, Florence Nightingale Shore. A fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, Agatha. The Christie Affair, a Christie-like mystery story of love and revenge by author Nina de Gramont, was a 2022 novel loosely based on Christie's disappearance.Other portrayals, such as the Hungarian film Kojak Budapesten (1980), create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skills. In the TV play Murder by the Book (1986), Christie (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) murders one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's Dorothy and Agatha and The London Blitz Murders by Max Allan Collins.

William Dugdale, the 17th-century antiquary, suggested that she had been born in 1441, based on evidence of inquisitions post mortem taken after the death of her father. Dugdale has been followed by a number of Lady Margaret's biographers; however, it is more likely that she was born in 1443, as in May 1443 her father had negotiated with the king concerning the wardship of his unborn child should he die on campaign.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was granted the titles of Anwar ud-din Khan Bahadur by Emperor Aurangzeb 'Alamgir, Shahamat Jang by Emperor Shah Alam I, and Siraj ud-Daula by Emperor Muhammad Shah. He was sometimes Naib-wazir of the Empire, Faujdar of Srikakulam, Rajamahendravaram and Machlipatnam in 1724 and Nazim of Hyderabad from 1725-1743.\nMuhammad Anwaruddin was appointed to Faujdar of Chicacole, Naib Subadar and regent of the Carnatic during the minority of Saadatullah Khan II on 28 March 1744.

Anwaruddin maintaining a cordial relationship with the East India Company would come into conflict with the French after the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk in 1748.\nIn 1746, the French and the English fought to achieve supremacy over each other in India in the First Carnatic War. The Carnatic region became the arena of their action.\nIn 1746, the French captured the British post at Madras, and threatened but were unable to take that at Cuddalore.

He sent an army of 10,000 men under his son Mahfuz Khan. They fought against the 300-man French force in the Battle of Adyar on the banks of the Adyar River, and lost. The decisive French victory demonstrated the effectiveness of well-trained European forces in combating poorly trained Indian troops.\nMuhammad Anwaruddin received overtures for support from both from the English and the French, but supported the English. The French wanted to reduce the growing influence of the English in the Carnatic, so they supported Husayn Dost Khan, alias Chanda Sahib, as the rightful Nawab of the Carnatic against Muhammad Anwaruddin.\nWhile the British and the French supported their respective candidates for the Nawabship, they also took sides in the conflict over succession to the Nizam of Hyderabad. After the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk in 1748, there arose a rivalry between Nasir Jung, his second son, and Muzaffar Jang, his grandson. Muzaffar Jang came to the south with a strong force and allied himself with Chanda Sahib and the French.\nThe aging Nawab Muhammad Anwaruddin, supported by the English, met the French army at Ambur on 3 August 1749 and was killed in the battle at the age of 77.

The family's homes were the Herzog-Max-Palais in Munich during winter and Possenhofen Castle in the summer months, far from the protocols of court. Sisi and her siblings grew up in an unrestrained, unstructured environment; she often skipped her lessons to go riding in the countryside.In 1853, Archduchess Sophie, the domineering mother of 23-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph I, preferring a niece to a stranger for her daughter-in-law, arranged a meeting between her son and her sister Princess Ludovika's eldest daughter, Duchess Helene (\"N\u00e9n\u00e9\").

Ludovika also had the then-15-year-old Sisi accompany them for several reasons. Firstly, Sisi had been mourning the recent death of the young Count she had loved, and had fallen into a lengthy depression. Ludovika hoped the change of scenery would cheer her up. Secondly, Archduke Karl Ludwig, Franz Joseph's second younger brother, would also be joining the Imperial family. Karl Ludwig and Sisi had formed a close friendship in childhood, exchanging letters and gifts. Her mother hoped them seeing each other again would end with a possible engagement for Sisi.The Duchesses traveled from Munich in several coaches, but arrived later because Ludovika who was prone to migraines had to interrupt the journey to allow her time to recover. The coaches got separated and the one with their gala dresses never arrived. On their way to Bad Ischl, they visited Leopoldskron Palace where Theresa, the Queen Dowager of Bavaria was in mourning for her brother Georg, so they were dressed in black and unable to don more suitable clothing before meeting the young Emperor. While black did not suit 18-year-old Helene's dark coloring, it made her younger sister's blonder looks more striking.Helene was a pious, quiet young woman, and while she and Franz Joseph felt ill at ease in each other's company, he was instantly infatuated with her younger sister. He did not propose to Helene, but instead, he defied his mother and informed her that if he could not have Elisabeth, he would not marry at all.

After the former's death in 1095, civil war erupted, and Toghtekin supported Tutush's son Duqaq as emir of the city against Ridwan, the emir of Aleppo. In the chaotic years which ensued Toghtekin was sent to reconquer the town of Jebleh, which had rebelled against the qadi of Tripoli, but he was unable to accomplish his task.\nOn October 21, 1097, a Crusader army began the siege of Antioch. The local emir, Yaghi-Siyan, though nominally under Ridwan's suzerainty, appealed to Duqaq to send an armed force to their rescue. Duqaq sent Toghtekin, but on December 31, 1097, he was defeated by Bohemund of Taranto and Robert II of Flanders, and was forced to retreat. Another relief attempt was made by a joint force under Kerbogha, the atabeg of Mosul, and Toghtekin, which was also crushed by the Crusaders on June 28, 1098.\nWhen the Crusaders moved southwards from the newly conquered Antioch, the qadi of Jebleh sold his town to Duqaq, who installed Toghtekin's son, Taj al-Muluk Buri as its ruler. His tyrannical rule, however, led to his quick downfall. In 1103, Toghtekin was sent by Duqaq to take possession of Homs at the request of its inhabitants, after the emir Janah al-Dawla had been murdered by Assassins by order of Ridwan.\nThe following year Duqaq died and Toghtekin, now acting as regent and de facto ruler, had the former's junior son Tutush II proclaimed emir, while he married Duqaq's widow and reserved for himself the title of atabeg. After deposing Tutush II he had the brother of Duqaq, Irtash, named emir, but soon afterward he had him exiled. Irtash, with the support of Aytekin al-Halabi, the emir of Bosra, tried to reconquer Damascus, but was pushed back by Toghtekin and forced to find help at the court of King Baldwin I of Jerusalem.\nAround 1106, Toghtekin intervened to momentarily raise the siege of Tripoli by the Crusaders, but could not prevent the definitive capture of the city. In May 1108 he was able to defeat a small Christian force under Gervaise of Bazoches, lord of Galilee.  Gervaise was proposed to be freed in exchange for his possession, but he refused and was executed. In April 1110, Toghtekin besieged and captured Baalbek and named his son Buri as governor, replacing al-Taj G\u00fcm\u00fcshtegin.\nLate in November 1111, the town of Tyre, which was besieged by Baldwin's troops, put itself under Toghtekin's protection. Toghtekin, supported by Fatimid forces, intervened, forcing the Franks to raise the siege on April 10, 1112; however, he refused to take part in the anti-Crusade effort launched by Mawdud of Mosul, fearing that the latter could take advantage of it to gain rule over the whole of Syria.\nNonetheless, the next year the two Muslim commanders allied in reply to the ravages of Baldwin I and Tancred of Antioch. Their army besieged Tiberias, but they were unable to conquer it despite a sound victory at the Battle of Al-Sannabra in 1113 and they were forced to retreat to Damascus when Christian reinforcements arrived and supplies began to run out.\nDuring his sojourn in the city, Mawdud was killed by the Assassins on October 2, 1113.  The inhabitants accused Toghtekin of the deed. In 1114, he signed an alliance against the Franks with the new emir of Aleppo, Alp Arsl\u0101n al-Akhras, but the latter was murdered a short time later by his atabeg Lu\u02belu\u02be al-Yaya.\nIn 1115, Toghtekin decided to ally himself with the Kingdom of Jerusalem against the Seljuk general Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, who had been sent by the Seljuk sultan Muhammad I Tapar to fight the Crusaders. The following year, judging the Franks too powerful, he visited Baghdad to obtain a pardon from the sultan, though never forgetting to remain independent himself between the two main forces.\nAllied with Ilghazi, emir of Aleppo, he attacked Athareb in the Principality of Antioch, but was defeated at the Battle of Hab on August 14, 1119. In the June of the following year he sent help to Ilghazi, who was again under peril of annihilation in the same place. In 1122 the Fatimids, no longer able to defend Tyre, sold it to Toghtekin, who installed a garrison there, but the garrison was unable to prevent its capture by the Franks on July 7, 1124.\nIn 1125, al-Bursuqi, now in control of Aleppo, appeared in the Antiochean territory with a large army which Toghtekin joined; however, the two were defeated at the Battle of Azaz on June 11, 1125. The following January Toghtekin also had to repel an invasion by Baldwin II of Jerusalem. In late 1126 he again invaded the Principality of Antioch with Bursuqi, but again with no results.\nToghtekin died in 1128. He was succeeded by his son Buri.\nIn the Old French Crusade cycle chansons de geste, Toghtekin is known as \"Dodequin\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Somerset negotiated with the king to ensure that if he were to die, the rights to Margaret's wardship and marriage would be granted only to his wife.As Somerset was a tenant-in-chief of the crown, the wardship of his heir fell to the crown under the feudal system. Somerset fell out with the king after coming back from France and was banished from the royal court pending a charge of treason against him. He died shortly afterwards. According to Thomas Basin, Somerset died of illness, but the Crowland Chronicle reported that his death was a suicide. As his only surviving child, Margaret was heiress to his considerable fortune and inheritor of his contested claim to the throne. Both effectively rendered Margaret, as her biographers Jones and Underwood write, \"a pawn in the unstable political atmosphere of the Lancastrian court\".Upon her first birthday, the king broke the arrangement with Margaret's father and granted the wardship of her extensive lands to William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, although Margaret herself remained in the custody of her mother. Margaret's mother was pregnant at the time of Somerset's death, but the child did not survive and Margaret remained the sole heir. Although she was her father's only legitimate child, Margaret had two maternal half-brothers and three maternal half-sisters from her mother's first marriage whom she supported after her son's accession to the throne.\nMargaret was married to Suffolk's son, John de la Pole. The wedding may have been held between 28 January and 7 February 1444, when she was perhaps a year old but certainly no more than three. However, there is more evidence to suggest they were married in January 1450, after Suffolk had been arrested and was looking to secure his son's future by betrothing him to a conveniently wealthy ward whose children could be potential claimants to the throne. Papal dispensation was granted on 18 August 1450, necessary because the spouses were closely related (Lady Margaret and de la Pole being the great-grandchildren of two sisters, Katherine Swynford and Philippa Chaucer, respectively), and this concurs with the later date of marriage. Three years later, her marriage to de la Pole was dissolved, and King Henry VI granted Margaret's wardship to his own half-brothers, Jasper and Edmund Tudor.Margaret never recognised the marriage to de la Pole. In her will, made in 1472, Margaret refers to Edmund Tudor as her first husband. Under canon law, Margaret was not bound by her first marriage contract as she was entered into the marriage before reaching the age of twelve.Even before the annulment of her first marriage, Henry VI chose Margaret as a bride for his half-brother, Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond. This was likely to strengthen Edmund's claim to the throne should Henry be forced to designate Edmund his heir; the king was then without child or legitimate siblings. Edmund was the eldest son of the king's mother, Catherine of Valois, by Owen Tudor.At nine years old Margaret was required to assent formally to the marriage. Later she claimed she was divinely guided to do so.At age twelve Margaret married Edmund Tudor, twelve years her senior, on 1 November 1455. The Wars of the Roses had just broken out. Edmund, a Lancastrian, was taken prisoner by Yorkist forces less than a year later. He died of the plague in captivity at Carmarthen on 3 November 1456, leaving a 13-year-old widow who was pregnant with their child.The Countess always respected the name and memory of Edmund as the father of her only child. In 1472, sixteen years after his death, Margaret specified in her will that she wanted to be buried alongside Edmund, even though she had enjoyed a long, stable and close marriage with her third husband, who had died in 1471.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The latter offered the Ziyarid money and territory in exchange for the surrender of Fakhr al-Dawla, but Qabus refused. 'Adud then invaded and conquered Tabaristan; in 981 'Adud's brother Mu'ayyad al-Dawla took Gurgan. Qabus and Fakhr al-Dawla were forced to flee to Samanid Khurasan.

Another story attributes his name to a wild boar that walked past the threshold of the house where his mother was resting shortly after giving birth to him. However, both of these explanations are likely to have originated at some point after his reign; it is more probable that he took the name Ralambo after propagating the consumption of the meat of the zebu, called lambo in the proto-Malagasy language and the Malayo-Polynesian tongue from which it derived.A popular legend imbues the birth of Ralambo with a mystical character. The legend relates that his mother, who was known in her youth as Ramaitsoanala (\"Green Forest\"), was the daughter of the Vazimba water goddess Ivorombe (\"Great Bird\"). With the assistance of her celestial mother, Ramaitsoanala confronted and overcame numerous obstacles.

The genealogy of the Danish kings which William drew up on this occasion to disprove the alleged impediment of consanguinity and two books of his letters, some of which deal with this affair, have come down to us.Philip married Agnes of Merania in June 1196. In that same year, Ingeborg wrote to Pope Celestine III, declaring her grief of this event. This letter was one of a handful of Ingeborg's letters in Latin that spoke of unfair treatment regarding her marriage. Then, in 1198, the new pope, Pope Innocent III, declared that this new marriage was void because the previous marriage was still valid. He ordered Philip to dismiss Agnes and take Ingeborg back. Ingeborg had written to him, stating abuse and isolation and claiming thoughts of suicide because of harsh treatment.\nPhilip's response was to lock Ingeborg away in the Ch\u00e2teau d'\u00c9tampes in Essonne.  Locked up in a tower, Ingeborg was a prisoner.  Food was irregular and sometimes insufficient.  No one was allowed to visit her, except for one occasion when two Danish chaplains were allowed to visit. Philip, meanwhile, brought Agnes back, and continued to live with her, producing a second child, a son. For these offences, Philip was excommunicated in 1200, and the kingdom was placed under an interdict. When the king did not comply, Pope Innocent III placed France under interdict in 1199 until September 1200 when Philip said he would obey. He later reneged on that promise. Although the queenship of Ingeborg was restored, she remained imprisoned. Agnes died the following year.\nIn 1201 Philip asked the Pope to declare his children legitimate and the Pope complied to gain his political support.

Carloman had an older brother, Charles the Younger, and half brother Pepin the Hunchback, Charlemagne's eldest son. Charlemagne had been king of the Franks since 768, and in 774 conquered the Kingdom of the Lombards in northern Italy, partially on the request of Pope Adrian I for assistance against the Lombard king Desiderius. In 781, Charlemagne and Hildegard brought Carloman along with his younger brother Louis the Pious and sisters Rotrude and Bertha, daughter of Charlemagne to Rome at Adrian's request. Carloman was four years old, but his parents had delayed his baptism so that the Pope could perform it. Carloman was baptized, and Adrian then crowned him as king of the Lombards (later styled king of Italy) and his brother Louis as king of Aquitaine.  As part of Carloman's baptism, he was renamed Pepin, now sharing a name with his half-brother. The reason behind the name change is obscure, but it was likely chosen to evoke the memory of his grandfather Pepin the Short, remembered as a staunch ally of the papacy, and this legacy was important to emphasize for the young king who was to rule Italy.Though only four years old, Pepin's coronation was not nominal\u2014he was brought to Lombardy to live under the care of advisors provided by Charlemagne,the most important of which were Adalard of Corbie, Waldo of Reichenau, the Lombard duke Rotchild, and Angilbert. Pepin's court was based primarily at Verona, though he also operated from palaces in Mantua and the traditional Lombard capital of Pavia. Pepin was king in his own name, but Charlemagne took a strong hand in Italy even into Pepin's adulthood, even on occasion issuing laws directly.After Pepin came of age, he began fulfilling his role as a military leader. He participated in his father's campaign against Tassilo III of Bavaria in 786. In 796, he led a campaign against the Avar Khaganate, taking their stronghold and precipitating the collapse of the Avar state, allowing the Frankish realm to expand eastward. Pepin's victory was celebrated in the contemporary Latin poem De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica. Pepin also led multiple raids against the Duchy of Benevento and a successful campaign in 810 against the Republic of Venice.In 806, Charlemagne gathered his sons and issued the Divisio Regnorum, which outlined formalized plans for the inheritance of the empire upon his death. Pepin was confirmed in this rule of Italy while also gaining most of Bavaria and Alamannia; Louis gained Provence, Septimania, and most of Burgundy in addition to Aquitaine; and Charles as his eldest son in good favour (Pepin the Hunchback having been confined to a monestary after a failed rebellion), was given the largest share of the inheritance, with rule of Francia proper along with Saxony, Nordgau, and parts of Alemannia. Charlemagne did not address the inheritance of the title of emperor he had gained in 800. The Divisio also addressed the death of any of the brothers, and urged peace between them and between any of their nephews who might inherit.Charlemagne's succession plans did not come to fruition. Pepin died on 8 July 810, followed in quick succession by the deaths of his sister Rotrude, his aunt Gisela, Abbess of Chelles, and his half brother Pepin, and his brother Charles over the course of 810\u2013811. All were possibly victims of an epidemic that had spread from cattle in 810. In the wake of these deaths, Charlemagne declared Pepin's son Bernard ruler of Italy, and his own only surviving son Louis as heir to the rest of the empire. Louis and Bernard were formally invested as Charlemagne's heirs in September of 813, and would fully succeed upon his death in 814.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His mother had been Jane Grocott or Groocock and his sister Jane was born in 1835. William Mathew went to school at Staveley, Derbyshire and his exercise book in penmanship survives, prefiguring his adult career as a law clerk and lawyer and his lifelong interest in graphics. By 1852 his father was in business in Birmingham but William Mathew was a law clerk in London. He lived in Holborn, worked for Waterlow and Sons, famous printers of stamps and bank notes, and for the Patent Office. By 1855 he was in Paris where he assisted in 'literary work' at Versailles, perhaps copying correspondence or graphic works. Back in London about 1857 he studied Turner's paintings and other artists, at Hampton Court and the National Gallery. In 1859 he worked at the National Portrait Gallery in London.Sometime between 1856 and 1858 Hodgkins's family emigrated to Melbourne in Australia. In 1859 he followed them on the White Star whose surgeon was Thomas Hocken. By April 1862 Hodgkins had left Melbourne and was living in Dunedin.He worked as an ornamental writer and then for Gillies and Richmond, no doubt as a law clerk. He met Rachel Owen Parker and married her at St. Paul's Cathedral, Dunedin, 19 September 1865. He was admitted to the Otago Bar in 1868.\nHodgkins earliest known painting is dated 1862. It is not known how he learnt the craft but his association with George O'Brien may be significant. He did not exhibit in the New Zealand Industrial Exhibition, held in Dunedin in 1865 but took charge of its photographic department. He organised a Fine Arts exhibition in Dunedin in 1869 with the aim of starting a public art gallery. That did not happen but in 1875 he founded what soon became the Otago Art Society. Although there was resistance to his plans to start an art gallery under his presidency in 1881 the society started to collect pictures. In 1882 its council agreed to start a 'national collection of works of art'. A resolution of 14 October 1884 effectively founded the Dunedin Public Art Gallery the first institution of its kind in New Zealand.\nHodgkins's career as a lawyer went into decline. In 1884 he moved his family from a house in Royal Terrace, a good address in the city, to a rented cottage at Ravensbourne, a harbourside suburb. In 1888 he was declared bankrupt. Hodgkins struggled out of these difficulties, eventually moving the family back to a large rented house in town. He was involved in organising the art department of the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition held in Dunedin in 1889. In the same year he proposed the idea of a government-funded national gallery with collections in each of the four main centres. While that did not happen, the collection of the Dunedin gallery was augmented from the exhibition, a new building erected, and a support group was founded: the Dunedin Public Art Gallery Society.Hodgkins' own art had developed considerably. An accomplished landscape painter in the Romantic manner of Turner the most notable characteristic of his work is its use of colour. New styles were brought to New Zealand in 1890 by G. P. Nerli, Petrus Van der Velden and J. M. Nairn. Hodgkins embraced the newcomers and with Nerli in Dunedin the resulting twin circles of painters made the city for a while the foremost centre of art in New Zealand.Hodgkins died in Dunedin on 9 February 1898, survived by his wife, two daughters and four sons. He left his family poor but they and the community remembered a cheerful, persevering, ambitious man. The society and the public gallery he had founded endured and prospered. He had published the first considered statement of any length on New Zealand art and he left behind a body of works the best of which are among the best of their kind in New Zealand. The Southern Alps of New Zealand.. of 1885 is often mentioned; The South Canterbury Plains from near Peel Forest of 1882 is remarkable for its breadth and simplicity. Both are now in the collection of the Dunedin Public Art Gallery. Hodgkins's daughters Isabel, and particularly his younger daughter Frances, furthered his interest in art. In retrospect Frances's estimation of him does not seem exaggerated. He is undoubtedly one of New Zealand's most influential artistic figures of the 19th century.His daughter Isabel, also known as Cissy, married William Hughes Field in 1893.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 406 BC, he and his forces captured the Volscian city of Anxur (modern Terracina) by securing the high ground above the town, from which they were able to launch attacks against its walls. When the town's defenders attempted to respond to these harassing attacks, the remainder of Numerius' forces used escalade to scale the walls and enter the town. After the victory, his forces began to torture the inhabitants of the city in retaliation for the Volscian massacre of the Roman garrison at Verrugo, thought to be located in the Trerus valley, (modern Sacco river valley) of the Lazio region, and where the Roman prisoners had been horribly tortured. Numerius eventually showed mercy, and around 2500 Volscians were permitted to surrender with their lives.Fabius was consular tribune in 406 BC, and again in 390. It was in his second consulship that he and his two brothers were sent as ambassador to the Gauls who were besieging Clusium. During this mission he participated in an attack against the besieging Gauls. The Gauls demanded that the three should be surrendered to them for violating the law of nations.  When the Roman Senate refused to give up the guilty parties, the Gauls marched against Rome, which they sacked after the battle of the Allia.Many scholars believe the entire story of the events at Clusium to be fiction, as Clusium had no real reason to appeal to Rome for help, and the Gauls needed no real provocation to sack Rome.

He led North Korea from the death of his father Kim Il Sung in 1994 until his own death in 2011, when he was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Un. Afterwards, Kim Jong Il was declared Eternal General Secretary of the WPK.\nIn the early 1980s, Kim had become the heir apparent for the leadership of North Korea, thus being established the Kim dynasty, and he assumed important posts in party and army organs. Kim succeeded his father and founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, following his death in 1994. Kim was the General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), WPK Presidium, Chairman of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of North Korea and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), the fourth-largest standing army in the world.\nKim ruled North Korea as a repressive and totalitarian dictatorship. Kim assumed leadership during a period of catastrophic economic crisis amidst the dissolution of the Soviet Union, on which it was heavily dependent for trade in food and other supplies, which brought a famine. While the famine had ended by the late 1990s, food scarcity continued to be a problem throughout his tenure. Kim strengthened the role of the military by his Songun (\"military-first\") policies, making the army the central organizer of civil society. Kim's rule also saw tentative economic reforms, including the opening of the Kaesong Industrial Park in 2003. In April 2009, North Korea's constitution was amended to refer to him and his successors as the \"supreme leader of the DPRK\".\nThe most common colloquial title given to Kim during his lifetime was \"Dear Leader\" to distinguish him from his father Kim Il Sung, the \"Great Leader\". Following Kim's failure to appear at important public events in 2008, foreign observers assumed that Kim had either fallen seriously ill or died. On 19 December 2011, the North Korean government announced that he had died two days earlier, whereupon his third son, Kim Jong Un, was promoted to a senior position in the ruling WPK and succeeded him. After his death, alongside \"Eternal General Secretary\" of the WPK, Kim Jong Il was declared \"Eternal Chairman\" of the now defunct National Defence Commission, in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead members of the Kim dynasty.

Kandahar was, as agreed, given to the Shah of Persia who sent his infant son, Murad, as the viceroy. However, the baby soon died and Humayun thought himself strong enough to assume power.Humayun now prepared to take Kabul, ruled by his brother Kamran Mirza. In the end, there was no actual siege. Kamran Mirza was detested as a leader and as Humayun's Persian army approached the city hundreds of the former's troops changed sides, flocking to join Humayun and swelling his ranks. Kamran Mirza absconded and began building an army outside the city. In November 1545, Hamida and Humayun were reunited with their son Akbar, and held a huge feast. They also held another feast in the child's honour when he was circumcised.\nHowever, while Humayun had a larger army than Kamran Mirza and had the upper hand, on two occasions his poor military judgement allowed the latter to retake Kabul and Kandahar, forcing Humayun to mount further campaigns for their recapture. He might have been aided in this by his reputation for leniency towards the troops who had defended the cities against him, as opposed to Kamran Mirza, whose brief periods of possession were marked by atrocities against the inhabitants who, he supposed, had helped his brother.His youngest brother, Hindal Mirza, formerly the most disloyal of his siblings, died fighting on his behalf.

Humayun, though inclined to forgive Kamran Mirza, was warned that allowing his brother's repeated acts of treachery to go unpunished could foment rebellion amongst his own supporters. So, instead of killing Kamran Mirza, Humayun had him blinded, thereby ending any claim by the latter to the throne.

Al-Mutanabbi's time at the court of Sayf al-Dawla was arguably the pinnacle of his career as poet. During his nine years at Aleppo, al-Mutanabbi wrote 22 major panegyrics to Sayf al-Dawla, which, according to the Arabist Margaret Larkin, \"demonstrated a measure of real affection mixed with the conventional praise of premodern Arabic poetry.\" The celebrated historian and poet, Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, was also part of the Hamdanid court, and dedicated his major encyclopedia of poetry and songs, Kitab al-Aghani, to Sayf al-Dawla. Abu Firas was Sayf al-Dawla's cousin and had been raised at his court; Sayf al-Dawla had married his sister Sakhinah and appointed him governor of Manbij and Harran. Abu Firas accompanied Sayf al-Dawla on his wars against the Byzantines and was taken prisoner twice. It was during his second captivity from 962 to 966 that he wrote his famous R\u016bmiyy\u0101t (i.e. Byzantine) poems. Sayf al-Dawla's patronage of poets had a useful political dividend too: it was part of a court poet's duty to his patron to celebrate him in his work, and poetry helped spread the influence of Sayf al-Dawla and his court far across the Muslim world. Sayf al-Dawla paid special favour to poets, but his court contained scholars versed in religious studies, history, philosophy and astronomy as well, so that, as S. Humphreys comments, \"in his time Aleppo could certainly have held its own with any court in Renaissance Italy\". The Hamdanid emir himself probably also knew Greek, and was conversant with Ancient Greek culture.Sayf al-Dawla was also unusual for 10th-century Syria in his espousal of Twelver Shi'ism in a hitherto solidly Sunni country. During his reign, the founder of the Alawite Shi'a sect, al-Khasibi, benefited from Sayf al-Dawla's patronage. Al-Khasibi turned Aleppo into the stable centre of his new sect, and sent preachers from there as far as Persia and Egypt with his teachings. His main theological work, Kitab al-Hidaya al-Kubra, was dedicated to his Hamdanid patron. Sayf al-Dawla also erected a mausoleum to one of al-Husayn's sons, Muhassin, outside the city walls of Aleppo and close to a Christian monastery, called the Mashhad al-Dikka. In the aftermath of the 962 sack of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla invited Alid sharifs from Qom and Harran to settle in his capital. His active promotion of Shi'ism began a process whereby Syria came to host a large Shi'a population by the 12th century.Sayf al-Dawla played a crucial role in the history of the two cities he chose as his capitals, Aleppo and Mayyafariqin. His choice raised them from obscurity to the status of major urban centres; Sayf al-Dawla lavished attention on them, endowing them with new buildings, as well as taking care of their fortification. Aleppo especially benefited from Sayf al-Dawla's patronage: of special note is the great palace (destroyed in the Byzantine sack of 962) in the suburb of Halba outside Aleppo, as well as the gardens and aqueduct which he built there.

Bakunin's prestige as a revolutionary also made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, gaining substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.\nBakunin grew up in Pryamukhino, a family estate in Tver Governorate. From 1840, he studied in Moscow, then in Berlin hoping to enter academia. Later in Paris, he met Karl Marx and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who deeply influenced him. Bakunin's increasing radicalism ended hopes of a professorial career. He was expelled from France for opposing the Russian Empire's occupation of Poland. After participating in the 1848 Prague and 1849 Dresden uprisings, Bakunin was imprisoned, tried, sentenced to death, and extradited multiple times. Finally exiled to Siberia in 1857, he escaped via Japan to the United States and then to London, where he worked with Alexander Herzen on the journal Kolokol (The Bell). In 1863, Bakunin left to join the insurrection in Poland, but he failed to reach it and instead spent time in Switzerland and Italy.\nIn 1868, Bakunin joined the International Workingmen's Association, leading the anarchist faction to rapidly grow in influence. The 1872 Hague Congress was dominated by a struggle between Bakunin and Marx, who was a key figure in the General Council of the International and argued for the use of the state to bring about socialism. In contrast, Bakunin and the anarchist faction argued for the replacement of the state by federations of self-governing workplaces and communes. Bakunin could not reach the Netherlands, and the anarchist faction lost the debate in his absence. Bakunin was expelled from the International for maintaining, in Marx's view, a secret organisation within the International, and founded the Anti-Authoritarian International in 1872. From 1870 until his death in 1876, Bakunin wrote his longer works such as Statism and Anarchy and God and the State, but he continued to directly participate in European worker and peasant movements. In 1870, he was involved in an insurrection in Lyon, France. Bakunin sought to take part in an anarchist insurrection in Bologna, Italy, but his declining health forced him to return to Switzerland in disguise.\nBakunin is remembered as a major figure in the history of anarchism, an opponent of Marxism, especially of the dictatorship of the proletariat; and for his predictions that Marxist regimes would be one-party dictatorships ruling over the proletariat, not rule by the proletariat. His book God and the State has been widely translated and remains in print. Bakunin has had a significant influence on thinkers such as Peter Kropotkin, Errico Malatesta, Herbert Marcuse, E. P. Thompson, Neil Postman and A. S. Neill as well as syndicalist organizations such as the IWW, the anarchists in the Spanish Civil War and contemporary anarchists involved in the modern-day anti-globalization movement.", "hasanswer": true}]}

According to the first explanation, her grandparents were Antiochus III the Great and Laodice III. Through her mother\u2019s previous marriages, she had various maternal half-brothers and sisters and two full blooded brothers who served as Seleucid kings Antiochus V Eupator and Alexander Balas.  In 152 BC, Laodice became one of the supporters for her brother Alexander Balas, who revolted and overthrew the Seleucid king Demetrius I Soter, who was their maternal half-brother/cousin.\nThe other alternative is Laodice appears to have come from obscure origins, connected with the same impostorship as Alexander Balas. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates V. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain. The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice VI.\nAfter 152 BC, Laodice married King Mithridates V of Pontus, who reigned from 150\u2013120 BC. Mithridates V and Laodice VI were related, as her husband had lineage from the Seleucid dynasty. Little is known regarding her relationship with her husband or her reign as Pontian queen. During their marriage, Laodice bore Mithridates V seven children: Laodice (I) (by marriage Queen consort of Cappadocia), Mithridates VI of Pontus, Mithridates Chrestus, Laodice (II) (by marriage Queen consort of Pontus), Nysa (sometimes spelt as Nyssa), Roxana and Statira. Nysa, Roxana and Statira were put to death after the fall of the Kingdom of Pontus in 63 BC.\nMithridates V was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held. In the will of Mithridates V, he left the kingdom to the joint rule of Laodice, Mithridates VI and Mithridates Chrestus. Both of her sons were underage to rule and Laodice retained all power as regent.Laodice in her regency favored her second son over her first son. During her regency 120\u2013116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC), Mithridates VI escaped from the plotting of his mother and had gone into hiding. She enjoyed luxuries that made her a compliant client of Rome. She accepted bribes from the Roman Republic and her extravagance pushed Pontus into debt.Mithridates VI between 116\u2013113 BC returned to Pontus from hiding and was hailed king. He was able to remove his mother and his brother from the Pontian throne, thus Mithridates VI became the sole ruler of Pontus. Mithridates VI show clemency towards his mother and brother, by imprisoning them both.

She died in her sleep of Alzheimer's disease at the Greenways Nursing Home, Hampstead, North London, on 28 November 1968, aged 71. A memorial service was held at St James's Church, Piccadilly and she was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, where her ashes remain. Blyton's home, Green Hedges, was auctioned on 26 May 1971 and demolished in 1973; the site is now occupied by houses and a street named Blyton Close. An English Heritage blue plaque commemorates Blyton at Hook Road in Chessington, where she lived from 1920 to 1924. In 2014, a plaque recording her time as a Beaconsfield resident from 1938 until her death in 1968 was unveiled in the town hall gardens, next to small iron figures of Noddy and Big Ears.Since her death and the publication of her daughter Imogen's 1989 autobiography, A Childhood at Green Hedges, Blyton has emerged as an emotionally immature, unstable and often malicious figure. Imogen considered her mother to be \"arrogant, insecure, pretentious, very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things out of her mind, and without a trace of maternal instinct. As a child, I viewed her as a rather strict authority. As an adult I pitied her.\" Blyton's eldest daughter Gillian remembered her rather differently however, as \"a fair and loving mother, and a fascinating companion\".The Enid Blyton Trust for Children was established in 1982, with Imogen as its first chairman, and in 1985 it established the National Library for the Handicapped Child. Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine began publication in September 1985 and, on 14 October 1992, the BBC began publishing Noddy Magazine and released the Noddy CD-Rom in October 1996.The first Enid Blyton Day was held at Rickmansworth on 6 March 1993 and, in October 1996, the Enid Blyton award, The Enid, was given to those who have made outstanding contributions towards children. The Enid Blyton Society was formed in early 1995, to provide \"a focal point for collectors and enthusiasts of Enid Blyton\" through its thrice-annual Enid Blyton Society Journal, its annual Enid Blyton Day and its website. On 16 December 1996, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary about Blyton, Secret Lives. To celebrate her centenary in 1997, exhibitions were put on at the London Toy & Model Museum (now closed), Hereford and Worcester County Museum and Bromley Library and, on 9 September, the Royal Mail issued centenary stamps.The London-based entertainment and retail company Trocadero plc purchased Blyton's Darrell Waters Ltd in 1995 for \u00a314.6 million and established a subsidiary, Enid Blyton Ltd, to handle all intellectual properties, character brands and media in Blyton's works. The group changed its name to Chorion in 1998 but, after financial difficulties in 2012, sold its assets. Hachette UK acquired from Chorion world rights in the Blyton estate in March 2013, including The Famous Five series but excluding the rights to Noddy, which had been sold to DreamWorks Classics (formerly Classic Media, now a subsidiary of DreamWorks Animation) in 2012.\nBlyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to celebrate the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall. In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, Mr Tumpy's Caravan, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children's Books in a collection of papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death. It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.In a 1982 survey of 10,000 eleven-year-old children, Blyton was voted their most popular writer. She is the world's fourth most-translated author, behind Agatha Christie, Jules Verne and William Shakespeare with her books being translated into 90 languages. From 2000 to 2010, Blyton was listed as a Top Ten author, selling almost 8 million copies (worth \u00a331.2 million) in the UK alone. In 2003, The Magic Faraway Tree was voted 66th in the BBC's Big Read, a year-long survey of the UK's best-loved novels. In a 2008 poll conducted by the Costa Book Awards, Blyton was voted the UK's best-loved author ahead of Roald Dahl, J. K. Rowling, Jane Austen and Shakespeare. Her books continue to be very popular among children in Commonwealth nations such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malta, New Zealand and Australia, and around the world. They have also seen a surge of popularity in China, where they are \"big with every generation\". In March 2004, Chorion and the Chinese publisher Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press negotiated an agreement over the Noddy franchise, which included bringing the character to an animated series on television, with a potential audience of a further 95 million children under the age of five. Chorion spent around \u00a310 million digitising Noddy and, as of 2002, had made television agreements with at least 11 countries worldwide.Novelists influenced by Blyton include the crime writer Denise Danks, whose fictional detective Georgina Powers is based on George from the Famous Five. Peter Hunt's A Step off the Path (1985) is also influenced by the Famous Five, and the St. Clare's and Malory Towers series provided the inspiration for Jacqueline Wilson's Double Act (1996) and Ad\u00e8le Geras's Egerton Hall trilogy (1990\u201392) respectively.

{"id": "40_419", "question": "Who is Theodora (wife of Theophilos)'s child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_69936", "text": "Theodora (Greek: \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1; c. 815 \u2013 c. 867), sometimes called Theodora the Armenian or Theodora the Blessed, was Byzantine empress as the wife of Byzantine emperor Theophilos from 830 to 842 and regent for the couple's young son Michael III, after the death of Theophilos, from 842 to 856. She is sometimes counted as an empress regnant, who actually ruled in her own right, rather than just a regent. Theodora is most famous for bringing an end to the second Byzantine Iconoclasm (814\u2013843), an act for which she is recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Though her reign saw the loss of most of Sicily and failure to retake Crete, Theodora's foreign policy was otherwise highly successful; by 856, the Byzantine Empire had gained the upper hand over both the Bulgarian Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate, and the Slavic tribes in the Peloponnese had been forced to pay tribute, all without decreasing the imperial gold reserve.\nPossibly of Armenian descent, Theodora was born into a rural family of traders and military officials in Paphlagonia. In 830 she was selected by Euphrosyne, step-mother of the emperor Theophilos, for a bride-show for the young emperor. After being chosen by Theophilos she was crowned empress on 5 June 830. Theophilos was an iconoclast, who opposed the veneration of icons; it is unclear how aware he was that Theodora was an iconophile. Though she loyally participated in imperial affairs and ceremonies, and bore Theophilos seven children, Theodora continued to secretly venerate icons throughout her husband's reign. Theophilos died of dysentery on 20 January 842, probably younger than 30. On his deathbed, he named Theodora as regent for their two-year-old son Michael III and designated a selection of advisors to assist her. The most prominent of these advisors was the logothete and eunuch Theoktistos, who would become a close confidant of Theodora.\nTheodora proved to be fully capable of governing the empire. Though only in her late twenties, she led well and inspired loyalty, was surrounded by experienced officials, and had no obvious rivals. The reintroduction of icon veneration was made without much issue, though the Paulician heretics in eastern Anatolia were ruthlessly suppressed on Theodora's orders. Without the need of much military action, she managed to safeguard the empire from attacks by the Bulgarian rulers Presian and Boris I through diplomacy. The Byzantine sack of the city of Anazarbus in Cilicia largely ended the Arab threat for the near future. As Michael III grew older, he feared that Theodora meant to follow in the footsteps of Empress Irene and depose him in order to rule alone. Angered by Theodora's refusal to allow him to choose his own wife, Michael recalled her brother Bardas from exile, and with him assassinated Theoktistos in November 855. Theodora was enraged at Michael and the other conspirators for several months, before Michael, who was unable to placate his mother, deposed her on 15 March 856 and became sole emperor. Theodora continued to live in the imperial palace until 857 or 858, when she was expelled and confined to a convent in Gastria alongside some of her daughters. She may have been released from the convent around 863 and allowed to take some form of ceremonial role.

Instead, she worked first as an analyst with the Bureau of the Budget in New York City and with the Health Policy Advisory Center, and later as an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Old Westbury.\nIn 1972, Ehrenreich began co-teaching a course on women and health with feminist journalist and academic Deirdre English. Through the rest of the seventies, Ehrenreich worked mostly in health-related research, advocacy and activism, including co-writing, with English, several feminist books and pamphlets on the history and politics of women's health. During this period she began speaking frequently at conferences staged by women's health centers and women's groups, by universities, and by the United States government. She also spoke regularly about socialist feminism and about feminism in general.Throughout her career, Ehrenreich worked as a freelance writer. She is arguably best known for her non-fiction reportage, book reviews and social commentary.

She concluded that it was impossible to pay for food and rent without working at least two such jobs. Nickel and Dimed became a bestseller and admirers regard the book as \"a classic of social justice literature.\"\nEhrenreich founded the Economic Hardship Reporting Project with one main purpose: support immersive reporting on the working poor, in the manner of Ehrenreich's own Nickel and Dimed.Filling in for a vacationing Thomas Friedman as a columnist with The New York Times in 2004, Ehrenreich wrote about how, in the fight for women's reproductive rights, \"it's the women who shrink from acknowledging their own abortions who really irk me\" and said that she herself \"had two abortions during my all-too-fertile years\".In her 1990 book of essays, The Worst Years of Our Lives, she wrote that \"the one regret I have about my own abortions is that they cost money that might otherwise have been spent on something more pleasurable, like taking the kids to movies and theme parks.\"In 2005, The New Yorker called her \"a veteran muckraker\".In 2006, she founded United Professionals, an organization described as \"a nonprofit,  non-partisan membership organization for white-collar workers, regardless of profession or employment status.

Carol I expressed some concern at the direction that Prince Carol was taking, as the young Prince's only serious interest was stamp collecting and he spent an inordinate amount of time drinking, partying, and chasing after women; young Carol fathered at least two illegitimate children by the teenage schoolgirl Maria Martini by the time that he was 19. Carol rapidly became a favorite of gossip columnists around the world owing to the frequent photographs that appeared in the newspapers showing him at various parties with him holding a drink in one hand and a woman in the other.In order to teach the prince, the value of the Prussian virtues, the King had the prince commissioned as an officer into a Prussian guard's regiment in 1913. His time with the 1st Prussian Guards regiment did not achieve the desired results, and Carol remained the \"playboy prince\". Romania in the early 20th century was an intensely Francophile nation, indeed perhaps the most Francophile nation in the entire world as the Romanian elite obsessively went about embracing all things French as the model for perfection in everything. To a certain extent, Carol was influenced by the prevailing Francophilia, but at the same time, he inherited from Carol I, in the words of the American historian Margaret Sankey, a \"profound love of German militarism\" and the idea that all democratic governments were weak governments.\nIn November 1914, Carol joined the Romanian Senate, as the 1866 Constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching maturity. Known more for his romantic misadventures than for any leadership skills, Carol (Romanian for \"Charles\") was first married in the Cathedral Church of Odesa, Ukraine, 31 August 1918 (under the occupation of the Central Powers at that time), to Joanna Marie Valentina Lambrino (1898\u20131953), known as \"Zizi\", the daughter of a Romanian general, Constantin Lambrino. The fact that Carol technically had deserted as he left his post at the Army without permission to marry Zizi Lambrino caused immense controversy at the time. The marriage was annulled on 29 March 1919 by the Ilfov County Court. Carol and Zizi continued to live together after the annulment. Their only child, Mircea Gregor Carol Lambrino, was born on 8 January 1920.\nCarol next married Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark, who was known in Romania as Crown Princess Elena, on 10 March 1921 in Athens, Greece. They were second cousins, both of them great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria, as well as third cousins in descent from Nicholas I of Russia. Helen had known Carol's dissolute behavior and previous marriage, but was undeterred, being in love with Carol. The intention behind this arranged marriage was to help organize a dynastic alliance between Greece and Romania. Bulgaria had territorial disputes with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia and all three of the latter states tended to be close during the interwar period owing to their shared fears of the Bulgarians. Helen and Carol's only child, Michael, was born seven months after their marriage, sparking rumors that Michael was conceived out of wedlock. Apparently close at first, Carol and Helen drifted apart. Carol's marriage with Princess Helen was an unhappy one, and he frequently engaged in extramarital affairs. The elegant wallflower Helen found the bohemian Carol, with his love of heavy drinking and constant partying, rather too wild for her tastes. Carol disliked royal and aristocratic women, whom he found too stiff and formal for his tastes, and had an extremely marked preference for commoners, much to the chagrin of his parents. Carol found low-born women to have the qualities that he sought in a woman, such as informality, spontaneity, humor, and passion.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He belonged to the Agiads, one of the two royal dynasties of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids).\nIn c. 560 BC, Anaxandridas II, the new Agiad king of the Spartans, defeated the Acadian Tegeatae and compelled them to acknowledge the supremacy of Sparta.  By the time when the Lydian king Croesus sent his embassy to form an alliance with \"the mightiest of the Greeks\" (about 554 BC), the war with Tegea, which during the reigns of previous Spartan kings had gone against them, had, under Anaxandridas II and the Spartan Eurypontid king Ariston, been decided in the Spartans' favour. Anaxandridas II and Ariston also had main carriage of the suppression of the tyrannies, and with it the establishment of Spartan hegemony.\nUnder the leadership of the ephor Chilon, in office during the middle of the 6th century, Sparta ended its streak of violent conquests, such as in Messenia, and adopted a pro-Achaea policy based on diplomacy. Chilon claimed for Sparta the inheritance of the Achaean kings, who ruled the Peloponnese before the arrival of the Dorians (the invaders who had founded classical Sparta). Consistent with this policy, the legendary Achaean king Agamemnon started to be worshipped c. 550 BC in Amyclae (one of the villages of Sparta). The bones of Orestes and Tisamenus, Agamemnon's son and grandson, were taken from Tegea and Helike following advice from a Delphic oracle, then buried in Sparta. With these appropriations of Achaean heroes, Sparta convinced the non-Dorian Peloponnesian cities to join its alliance, which later became known as the Peloponnesian League.  The alliance aimed at containing Argos, Sparta's main Dorian rival in the Peloponnese.It nevertheless seems that Anaxandridas was opposed to the pro-Achaean policy of Chilon. The king was indeed forced by the ephors to marry a second wife after his first wife did not give him a son. Chilon's influence behind this decision can be detected, because the king's second wife was one of Chilon's relations. The second marriage rapidly produced a son, the future king Cleomenes I, but then Anaxandridas returned to his first wife, and she then bore him three children: Dorieus, Leonidas, and Cleombrotus.

During their joint reign, they sometimes joined the Hanseatic League in the fight against the piracy.

He settled his dispute with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights in March 1406 and undertook a pilgrimage to Rome, where Pope Gregory XII gave him a Golden Rose.  After his return, Wartislaw gave the Golden Rose to the Pudagla Monastery, where it was soon revered as miraculous.

During World War II, on 29 July 1942, the Soviet authorities introduced an Order of Alexander Nevsky to revive the memory of Alexander's struggle with the Germans. There was also an earlier Bulgarian Order dedicated to Saint Alexander which was founded on 25 December 1881, which ceased to exist when the People's Republic was declared on 16 September 1946.\nIn 1938, Sergei Eisenstein made one of his most acclaimed films, Alexander Nevsky, about Alexander's victory over the Teutonic Knights. The soundtrack for the film was written by Sergei Prokofiev, who also reworked the score into a concert cantata. Today the film is renowned for its extraordinary battle on ice sequence, which has served as inspiration for countless other films. In the picture, Nevsky used a number of Russian proverbs, tying Nevsky firmly to Russian tradition. The famous proverbial phrase (paraphrasing Matthew 26:52), \"Whoever will come to us with a sword, from a sword will perish,\" is a phrase that is often attributed to Alexander Nevsky, though it was not in fact said by him; it comes from Eisenstein's film, where it was said by actor Nikolai Cherkasov.\nThere is a long tradition of Russian naval vessels bearing Nevsky's name, such as the 19th-century propeller frigate Alexander Nevsky and K-550 Alexander Nevsky, a nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine currently in service with the Russian Navy.Alexander Nevsky's fame was spread wherever Imperial Russia had a strong influence; thus numerous cathedrals and churches were dedicated to him, including the Patriarchal Cathedral in Sofia, Bulgaria; the Cathedral church in Tallinn, Estonia; the Cathedral church in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland; the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Ungheni, Moldova.\nOn 24 September 2008, Alexander Nevsky was declared the main hero of Russia's history by popular vote, as reported by the Kommersant newspaper. In December 2008, he was voted the greatest Russian in the Name of Russia television poll.During the 2021 Moscow Victory Day Parade, a small historical segment of the parade featured Russian soldiers dressed in historical M1945 Red Army uniforms carrying out the Soviet combat banners which received the Order of Alexander Nevsky during the war.

After meeting Anne of Denmark, he wrote, \"she will prove, if I be not deceived, a magnifical prince, a kind wife and a constant mistress\".During the early reign of King James I of England, he was created Earl of Exeter on 4 May 1605, the same day his younger half-brother, Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cranborne, was created 1st Earl of Salisbury. Unlike his brother, however, he did not become a government minister under King James's rule.\nHe attempted to build up a family alliance with one of  King James's leading ministers, Sir Thomas Lake, by marrying his grandson, William Cecil, 16th Baron de Ros,  to Lake's daughter, Anne Lake, in 1615, but the marriage collapsed amidst a welter of allegations and counter-allegations of adultery and incest. The ensuing scandal fascinated the Court and dragged on for years, until in 1621, the Star Chamber found that Anne, her mother, and other members of the Lake family, had fabricated all of the original allegations.\nThe Cecil family fostered arts; they supported musicians such as William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons, and Thomas Robinson. The latter, in his youth, was in the service of Thomas Cecil.In 2019 Deborah Defoe proposed Thomas Cecil as a candidate in the Shakespearean authorship question in her book Behind the Arras: Thomas Cecil as Shakespeare.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She joined the party on 1 September 1930, and did some volunteer work, although she has not been characterized as politically active. From the local branch, Magda moved to the party headquarters in Berlin and for a brief period became secretary to Hans Meinshausen, Goebbels' deputy, before being invited to take charge of Goebbels' own private papers. She and Goebbels became romantically involved while on a short trip with friends to Weimar in February 1931. A relationship began and by April they began making plans for their future together. Goebbels wrote in his diary, \"We have made a solemn vow to each other: When we have conquered the Reich, we will become man and wife. I am very happy.\" Her flat on Theodor-Heuss-Platz (then named the Reichskanzlerplatz) soon became a favourite meeting place for Adolf Hitler and other NSDAP officials.\nBy September, the Goebbels relationship was experiencing problems. Goebbels was often jealous, and had some concern over the fact that Hitler had grown fond of Magda. Magda decided to advance their wedding date, and the couple were married on 19 December 1931, with Hitler as a witness. Otto Wagener claims that Magda's marriage to Goebbels was somewhat arranged; since Hitler intended to remain unmarried, it was suggested that as the wife of a leading and highly visible Nazi official she might eventually act as \"first lady of the Third Reich\". Magda was an ambitious woman with social connections and upper class bearing that may have influenced Goebbels' own enthusiasm. Goebbels biographer Peter Longerich concurred with this \"plausible\" conclusion as well. Meissner contends that Hitler (though undoubtedly impressed by Magda) was an exceptionally close friend of the couple in the early days. Hitler grew very fond of the Goebbels' six children and enjoyed staying at their Berlin apartment, where he could relax and would often arrive there late at night, sitting and talking with Goebbels, with their baby Helga (born 1932) on his lap.  Magda had thus a close relationship with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends. She acted as an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues. After 1933, the Goebbels family became accustomed to the luxurious lifestyle which went with their high social position. Their Berlin home on G\u00f6ringstrasse was remodeled by Albert Speer and they spent the spring and summers in Kladow. In 1936, they bought a villa on Schwanenwerder island and later another at Bogensee near Wandlitz in Brandenburg.\nJoseph and Magda Goebbels had six children: Helga (1932), Hilde (1934), Helmut (1935), Holde (1937), Hedda (1938), and Heide (1940).   Joseph Goebbels had many affairs during the marriage. In 1936, Goebbels met the Czech actress L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1 and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her. Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about the situation on 15 August 1938. Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship. Thereafter, Goebbels and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September. The couple had another falling out at that point, and once again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together. Hitler arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October 1938.

The German King Philip recognised Valdemar as the legitimate prince-archbishop of Bremen, because thus the prince-archbishopric would become his ally against Valdemar II.\nValdemar II and the fled capitulars protested to Pope Innocent III, who first wanted to research the case. When Bishop Valdemar left Rome for Bremen against Pope Innocent's order to wait his decision, he banished Valdemar by an anathema and in 1208 finally dismissed him as Bishop of Schleswig. In 1208, Burkhard, Count of Stumpenhausen, was elected by the fled capitulars in Hamburg as rival prince-archbishop and Valdemar II, usurping imperial power, invested Burkhard with the regalia \u2013 with effect only in the prince-archiepiscopal and diocesan territory north of the Elbe. In 1209 Innocent III finally consented the consecration of Bishop Nicholas I of Schleswig, a close confidant and consultant of King Valdemar, as successor of the deposed Bishop Valdemar. In 1214 King Valdemar appointed Bishop Nicholas I as Chancellor of Denmark, succeeding the late Peder Sunesen, Bishop of Roskilde.\nIn the same year Valdemar II invaded with Danish troops the prince-archiepiscopal territory south of the Elbe and conquered Stade. In August Prince-Archbishop Valdemar reconquered the city only to lose it soon after again to Valdemar II, who now built a bridge of the Elbe and fortified a forward post in Harburg upon Elbe. In 1209 Otto IV persuaded Valdemar II to withdraw into the north of the Elbe, urged Burkhard to resign and expelled Prince-Archbishop Valdemar.\nIn 1210, Innocent III made Gerhard I, Count of Oldenburg-Wildeshausen Bremen's new Prince-Archbishop. In 1211 Duke Bernard III of the younger Duchy of Saxony escorted his brother-in-law Valdemar, the papally dismissed Prince-Archbishop, into the city of Bremen, de facto regaining the See and enjoying the sudden support of Otto IV, who meanwhile fell out with Innocent over Sicily. As a reaction Valdemar II recaptured Stade, while in 1213 Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine, conquered it for Prince-Archbishop Valdemar.\nIn 1213 Valdemar instituted a war tax in Norway, and the peasants murdered Valdemar's tax collector at the Tr\u00f8ndelag Assembly and revolted. The uprising spread over several regions in Norway.\nIn 1216, Valdemar II and his Danish troops ravaged the County of Stade and conquered Hamburg. Two years later Valdemar II and Gerhard I allied to expel Henry V and Otto IV from the Prince-Archbishopric. Prince-Archbishop Valdemar finally resigned and entered into a monastery. Valdemar supported Emperor Frederick II and was rewarded with the emperor acknowledging Denmark rule of Schleswig and Holstein, all of the Wendish lands and Pomerania.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was the son of Frank Day-Lewis, a Church of Ireland rector of that parish, and Kathleen Blake (n\u00e9e Squires; died 1906). Some of his family were from England and the family had originally been from Berkhamstead, in Hertfordshire, and settled in Ireland in the late 1860s. His father took the surname \"Day-Lewis\" as a combination of his own birth father's (\"Day\") and adoptive father's (\"Lewis\") surnames. \nIn his autobiography The Buried Day (1960), Day-Lewis wrote: \"As a writer I do not use the hyphen in my surname \u2013 a piece of inverted snobbery which has produced rather mixed results.\"\n\nAfter the death of his mother in 1906, when he was two years old, Cecil was brought up in London by his father, with the help of an aunt, spending summer holidays with relatives in County Wexford. He was educated at Sherborne School and at Wadham College, Oxford. In Oxford, Day-Lewis became part of the circle gathered around W. H. Auden and helped him to edit Oxford Poetry 1927. His first collection of poems, Beechen Vigil, appeared in 1925.In 1928, Day-Lewis married Constance Mary King, the daughter of a Sherborne teacher. Day-Lewis worked as a schoolmaster in three schools, including Larchfield School, Helensburgh, Scotland (now Lomond School). During the 1940s, he had a long and troubled love affair with the novelist Rosamond Lehmann, to whom he dedicated his 1943 poetry collection Word Over All. His first marriage was dissolved in 1951, and he married actress Jill Balcon, daughter of Michael Balcon. Day-Lewis met Jill at the recording of a radio programme in 1948 and began a relationship with her that year, despite being married to Mary. He continued simultaneous relationships with his married wife Mary who lived with their two sons in Dorset, unmarried mistress Lehmann who lived in Oxfordshire, and Jill who was his latest love. Day-Lewis eventually broke with both his wife and his mistress in order to be with Jill. But he was no more faithful to Jill than he had been with Mary or Rosamond. Jill's father was deeply unhappy about the scandalous affair since Jill was named publicly as co-respondent in Day-Lewis' divorce. He disinherited Jill and cut off all relationships with her and Day-Lewis.During the Second World War, he worked as a publications editor in the Ministry of Information, an institution satirised by George Orwell in his dystopian Nineteen Eighty-Four, but equally based on Orwell's experience of the BBC. During the Second World War, his work was less influenced by Auden and he was developing a more traditional style of lyricism. Some critics believe that he reached his full stature as a poet in Word Over All (1943), when he finally distanced himself from Auden. After the war, he joined the publisher Chatto & Windus as a director and senior editor.\nIn 1946, Day-Lewis was a lecturer at Cambridge University, publishing his lectures in The Poetic Image (1947). Day-Lewis became a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the 1950 Birthday Honours. He later taught poetry at Oxford, where he was Professor of Poetry from 1951 to 1956. During 1962\u20131963, he was the Norton Professor at Harvard University. Day-Lewis was appointed Poet Laureate in 1968, in succession to John Masefield. His appointment came after appointments secretary John Hewitt consulted with Dame Helen Gardner, the Merton Professor of English at the University of Oxford (who stated that Day-Lewis \"produced run of the mill poetry but nothing particularly outstanding\") and Geoffrey Handley-Taylor, chair of the Poetry Society (who stated that Day-Lewis was \"a good administrative poet\" and \"a safe bet\").Day-Lewis was chairman of the Arts Council Literature Panel, vice-president of the Royal Society of Literature, an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Member of the Irish Academy of Letters and a Professor of Rhetoric at Gresham College, London.\n\nCecil Day-Lewis died from pancreatic cancer on 22 May 1972, aged 68, at Lemmons, the Hertfordshire home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard, where he and his family were staying.

Khosrov received the epithet Kotak because he was a man of short stature. He was the namesake of his paternal grandfather Khosrov II of Armenia, and the Parthian and Armenian monarchs of this name (see Khosrau).\nArmenia fell into chaos after the death of Tiridates III. An Arsacid prince named Sanatruk (whom Faustus of Byzantium calls Sanesan, king of Maskut, and identifies as Khosrov's brother) raised a rebellion to take the throne. In the southwest, the bdeashkh of Arzanene Bakur revolted against the Arsacid monarchy with the support of the Sasanian king Shapur II. The anti-Persian faction in Armenia led by Patriarch Vrtanes I crowned Khosrov king with the help of Constantine the Great. Khosrov crushed Bakur's rebellion and retook Arzanene and Armenian Mesopotamia. He then made peace with Sasanian Iran by agreeing to pay a yearly tribute to the Persians. Khosrov also exterminated two feuding princely houses in Armenia, the Ordunis and the Manavazians, and seized their lands.After the departure of the Roman legions from Armenia, Sanatruk invaded Armenia at the incitement of Shapur II with an army of various Caucasian mercenaries and invaded Ayrarat, the central province of the kingdom. Sanatruk took the city of Vagharshapat and forced Khosrov and Vrtanes to flee westward to Kogovit. Forces loyal to Khosrov rallied under Sparapet Vache Mamikonian and destroyed Sanatruk's army in a surprise attack, killing the pretender in a battle near Oshakan. Khosrov rewarded his top generals Vache Mamikonian and Vahan Amatuni and the other nakharars that had remained loyal to him with land and other lavish gifts. After this, the country enjoyed a period of peace, and Khosrov occupied himself with building his new capital city of Dvin. He also founded two large hunting grounds in Ayrarat called Khosrovakert and Tachar Mayri. The Khosrov Forest State Reserve in modern-day Armenia is named after him.\nIn 337, Shapur II's army laid siege to Nisibis, while one of his generals marched against central Armenia. A nakharar named Databe Bznuni was tasked with organizing the defense, but instead passed over to the Sasanian side. Vache Mamikonian and Vahan Amatuni led the Armenian army to victory against the Persian invaders in a battle near the southeastern coast of Lake Van. Databe Bznuni was executed; his house was annihilated and their holdings were seized by the king. After this, Khosrov decreed that all nakharars with a force larger than 1,000 soldiers were obligated to live at the royal court, where the king could exercise control over them. Khosrov broke off relations with Sasanian Iran and moved Armenia closer to the Roman Empire. Shapur soon invaded Armenia again but was repulsed at great cost to the Armenian defenders. Sparapet Vache Mamikonian and many other great lords were killed in battle. Khosrov died in 338/339 in Dvin. His remains were interred in the Arsacid royal mausoleum in Ani.

Carlo, initially studying law at Pisa University, chose to forgo completing his degree and instead married Letizia.Letizia became pregnant, giving birth to thirteen children in total, with eight surviving. Her firstborn, a son named Napoleon, was born in 1765 but passed away shortly after birth. Following this, a baby girl was born but did not survive. Subsequently, Carlo traveled to Rome, where he spent the next two years. Upon his return, he aligned himself with the republican leader Pasquale Paoli, taking on the role of his part-time secretary. During this period, Letizia became pregnant again, eventually giving birth to Joseph, originally named Giuseppe, on 7 January 1768.In 1768, when Genoa formally ceded the island to France, a Corsican guerrilla movement led by Paoli rose in revolt against the Genoese Republic. Carlo and Letizia, then 19-year-old and pregnant with the future Napoleon, joined Paoli and fled with the insurgents into the mountains near Corte. She would fight beside her husband in the struggle for independence. With Paoli's defeat in May 1769, the couple returned to Ajaccio.On the feast of the Assumption, 15 August 1769, while attending Mass at Ajaccio Cathedral, a minute's walk from Casa Buonaparte, Letizia went into labor. Legend has it that she gave birth at home on a carpet in the living room, depicting battles from the Iliad and Odyssey. The newborn boy was named Napoleon, in honor of an uncle who had passed away the previous year. For the first time, Letizia faced difficulties producing milk, leading her to hire a wet nurse named Camilla Llati as a surrogate mother. Letizia retained only one servant, a woman named Mammuccia Caterina, who lived with the family without wages and served as the midwife during Napoleon's birth.

This bay Arabian horse was bought in Aleppo, Syria, by Thomas Darley in 1704 and shipped to Aldby Park in England, as a present for his brother.One author in 1840 described Darley Arabian's arrival in England during the reign of Queen Anne as the event which \"forms the great epoch from which the history of the Turf [as in \"turf racing\"] should be dated\".There he stood at stud, usually private but sometimes open to outside mares. He was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1722. By all accounts, the Darley Arabian stood about 15 hands high and was of substantial beauty and refinement.The Darley Arabian sired the undefeated Flying Childers. He also sired Bartlett's Childers, an unraced brother of Flying Childers, who was the great-grandsire of the extremely influential Eclipse. The Darley Arabian was to become the most important sire in the history of the English Thoroughbred. His son Bulle Rock was the first Thoroughbred to be exported to America, in 1730.Most Thoroughbreds can be traced back to Darley Arabian.

He reigned from 578 to 535 BC. Roman and Greek sources describe his servile origins and later marriage to a daughter of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, Rome's first Etruscan king, who was assassinated in 579 BC. The constitutional basis for his accession is unclear; he is variously described as the first Roman king to accede without election by the Senate, having gained the throne by popular and royal support; and as the first to be elected by the Senate alone, with support of the reigning queen but without recourse to a popular vote.Several traditions describe Servius' father as divine. Livy depicts Servius' mother as a captured Latin princess enslaved by the Romans; her child is chosen as Rome's future king after a ring of fire is seen around his head. The Emperor Claudius discounted such origins and described him as an originally Etruscan mercenary, named Mastarna, who fought for Caelius Vibenna.Servius was a popular king, and one of Rome's most significant benefactors. He had military successes against Veii and the Etruscans, and expanded the city to include the Quirinal, Viminal and Esquiline hills. He is traditionally credited with the institution of the Compitalia festivals, the building of temples to Fortuna and Diana and, less plausibly, the invention of Rome's first true coinage.\nDespite the opposition of Rome's patricians, he expanded the Roman franchise and improved the lot and fortune of Rome's lowest classes of citizens and non-citizens. According to Livy, he reigned for 44 years, until murdered by his daughter Tullia and son-in-law Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. In consequence of this \"tragic crime\" and his hubristic arrogance as king, Tarquinius was eventually removed. This cleared the way for the abolition of Rome's monarchy and the founding of the Roman Republic, whose groundwork had already been laid by Servius' reforms.", "hasanswer": true}]}

His rule coincided with the Arab conquests in Caucasia. The 735-737 expedition by Marwan ibn Muhammad forced Archil and his brother Mirian to flee to the west through Egrisi into Abasgia where they joined the local dynast Leon I in the defense of Anacopia against the invading Arabs. Returning to Kakheti, Archil launched a program of reconstruction and Christianization of his mountainous pagan subjects. The Georgian texts also relate the rise of the Georgian Bagratids, a future royal dynasty, during the time of Archil.Around 786, eastern Georgia was subjected to another Arab invasion, this time led by Khuzayma ibn Khazim, who had been reconfirmed as viceroy of Arab-controlled Caucasia (Arm\u012bniya) by the caliph al-Hadi (r. 785-786).

A more powerful pretender was the real son of P\u0103tra\u0219cu cel Bun, Petru Cercel, who held the throne from 1583 to 1585, provoking Mihnea's exile to Tripoli (where he was kept in custody by Ottoman authorities).His wealthy mother's family gave gifts to the officials of the sultan, in order to purchase back the throne. The obligations he contracted in order to have Petru removed (around 700,000 scudi) forced Mihnea to increase the fiscal burden, and especially the quit-rent, to even higher levels upon his return to Bucharest. In addition, Mihnea allegedly promised Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha as many gold coins as 600 horses could carry, in order to have Petru killed; in March 1590, his request was granted by Sultan Murad III, who ordered Petru's execution, in exchange for 70,000 gold coins.One year after his mother Catherine's death, the Turks removed Mihnea for the second time.

From her father's first marriage to Cathleen Neilson, she had one elder half-sister, Cathleen Vanderbilt.Upon their father's death from cirrhosis when Vanderbilt was 18 months old, she and her half-sister became heiresses to a half share each in a $5 million trust fund, equivalent to $87 million in 2023 value. The control of Vanderbilt's share while she was a minor belonged to her mother, who traveled to and from Paris for years, taking her daughter with her.

As a result of her spending habits, her mother's use of finances was scrutinized by the child's paternal aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney.  A sculptor and philanthropist, Whitney wanted custody of her niece, which resulted in a custody trial. The trial was so scandalous that at times the judge would make everyone leave the room so as to listen to what young Vanderbilt had to say without anyone influencing her. Some people heard weeping and wailing inside the court room. Testimony was heard depicting Vanderbilt's mother as an unfit parent, including an allegation from Marie Caillot, her discharged French maid, of a lesbian affair with the Marchioness of Milford Haven, a relative of the British royal family, which Lady Milford Haven would subsequently deny in her own testimony. Vanderbilt's mother lost the battle and Vanderbilt became the ward of her aunt Gertrude.\nLitigation continued, however. Vanderbilt's mother was forced to live on a drastically reduced portion of her daughter's trust, which was worth more than $4 million at the end of 1937, equivalent to $85 million in 2023 value.

Most early Irish sources, including the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, the Annals of the Four Masters and Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn, place him in the traditional list of High Kings of Ireland, after Niall of the Nine Hostages and before Niall's son L\u00f3egaire, with Nath \u00cd's son, Ailill Molt, succeeding L\u00f3egaire. However, he is not included in the earliest list of kings of Tara, the Baile Chuinn Ch\u00e9tchathaig. T. F. O'Rahilly argues that Nath \u00cd did not rule at Tara, but was in fact a king of the province of Connacht, although he accepts that Ailill Molt was a king of Tara.:\u200ap. 211\u200a However, Nath \u00cd's name does not appear on the Connacht regnal lists, and Ailill Molt's does.:\u200ap. 232\u200a T. M. Charles-Edwards considers it a possibility that neither were kings of Tara, but that both were included later, when members of the U\u00ed Fiachrach dynasties were prominent and it was felt politically necessary to include their ancestors in the ranks of former High Kings.An early list of Nath \u00cd's battles takes him outside Ireland, including battles in Strathclyde and Kincardine in Scotland, and an expedition across the English Channel to the Alps.:\u200app. 212\u2013213\u200a In the Annals of Ulster there is an entry for the year 445 which originally consisted solely of Nath \u00cd's name. Later writers, presuming this to be his death notice, added the detail that he was struck by lightning in the Alps, circumstances also recounted in the Lebor Gab\u00e1la, Keating and the Annals of the Four Masters, the latter of which dates it to 428. According to legend, his followers carried his body back to Ireland, winning ten battles on the way, and buried him at Cruachan, capital of Connacht.:\u200a212\u2013213\u200a :\u200app. 77\u201378\u200a  A standing stone said to mark his grave is part of the Rathcroghan complex of archeological sites near Tulsk in County Roscommon.O'Rahilly and Francis J.

O'Rahilly therefore concludes that \"he was a king of Connacht in the first half of the fifth century, that he appears to have acquired fame in his day as a leader of predatory expeditions to Britain, and that he died in or about the year 445, and was probably buried at Cruachain.\":\u200a214\u2013215", "hasanswer": false}]}

Maximilian was considered peculiar; he loved circuses and traveled the Bavarian countryside to escape his duties. The family's homes were the Herzog-Max-Palais in Munich during winter and Possenhofen Castle in the summer months, far from the protocols of court. Sisi and her siblings grew up in an unrestrained, unstructured environment; she often skipped her lessons to go riding in the countryside.In 1853, Archduchess Sophie, the domineering mother of 23-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph I, preferring a niece to a stranger for her daughter-in-law, arranged a meeting between her son and her sister Princess Ludovika's eldest daughter, Duchess Helene (\"N\u00e9n\u00e9\"). Although the couple had never met, Franz Joseph's obedience was taken for granted by the Archduchess, who was once described as \"the only man in the Hofburg\" for her authoritarian manner.Princess Ludovika and Duchess Helene were invited to journey to the resort of Bad Ischl, Upper Austria to receive his formal proposal of marriage. Ludovika also had the then-15-year-old Sisi accompany them for several reasons. Firstly, Sisi had been mourning the recent death of the young Count she had loved, and had fallen into a lengthy depression. Ludovika hoped the change of scenery would cheer her up. Secondly, Archduke Karl Ludwig, Franz Joseph's second younger brother, would also be joining the Imperial family. Karl Ludwig and Sisi had formed a close friendship in childhood, exchanging letters and gifts. Her mother hoped them seeing each other again would end with a possible engagement for Sisi.The Duchesses traveled from Munich in several coaches, but arrived later because Ludovika who was prone to migraines had to interrupt the journey to allow her time to recover. The coaches got separated and the one with their gala dresses never arrived. On their way to Bad Ischl, they visited Leopoldskron Palace where Theresa, the Queen Dowager of Bavaria was in mourning for her brother Georg, so they were dressed in black and unable to don more suitable clothing before meeting the young Emperor. While black did not suit 18-year-old Helene's dark coloring, it made her younger sister's blonder looks more striking.Helene was a pious, quiet young woman, and while she and Franz Joseph felt ill at ease in each other's company, he was instantly infatuated with her younger sister. He did not propose to Helene, but instead, he defied his mother and informed her that if he could not have Elisabeth, he would not marry at all. Five days later, their betrothal was officially announced. The couple were married eight months later in Vienna, at the Augustinerkirche, on 24 April 1854.

Mstislav himself married twice; his first wife was a daughter of Iaroslav Iziaslavich of Volynia (and later Grand Prince of Kiev), while his second wife, whom he married sometime before 1176, was a daughter of Gleb Rostislavich of Riazan.\nMstislav was Prince of Belgorod in 1161 and again from 1171 to 1173, Prince of Toropets since 1167, and Prince of Smolensk from 1175 to 1177.  In 1168, he was one of thirteen princes of Rus' who, under Grand Prince Mstislav Iziaslavich, defeated the Polovtsy in a major battle on the steppe.  The following year, he and his brother Roman along with the son of Andrey Bogolyubsky, besieged Novgorod the Great but Bogolyubsky's army was defeated in battle.  In 1171, Mstislav and his brothers helped place their uncle, Vladimir Mstislavich of Dorogobuzh, on the Kievan throne, although he was soon deposed.  In 1172 and 1173, Mstislav also helped his brothers, Roman Rostislavich and then Rurik, take the throne in Kiev (indeed, Riurik sat on the Kievan throne seven times).  In 1174, Andrey Bogolyubsky sent an ambassador to Kiev to demand that the Rostislavichi leave the city and return it to Andrey's branch of the family.  In reply, Mstislav shaved the head and beard of an envoy and sent him back to Andrey, an act which was not only a sign of disrespect, but may also be seen as a forcible tonsure of the man.  It was also in violation of the law as the Russkaya Pravda set a fine of 12 grivnas for shaving a man's beard.  For this offense, Andrey attacked Mstislav and besieged him in the town of Vyshgorod for nine weeks but was unable to take him or the city.In 1179, Mstislav was elected prince of Novgorod (his older brothers, Roman, Sviatoslav, and David had also been chosen princes of Novgorod) and entered the city on 1 November 1179.  He led the Novgorodians against the Chud (Finnic tribes in modern-day Russia or Estonia) during the winter of 1179\u20131180, but fell ill the following spring and died on 14 June 1180. He was buried following a divine liturgy presided over by Archbishop Ilya of Novgorod, the hegumens of the Novgorodian monasteries, and the Novgorodian clergy; his remains now lie in a gypsum sarcophagus along the south wall of the Chapel of the Nativity of the Mother of God in the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom in Novgorod the Great across the chapel from Bishop St. Nikita.  (Mstislav Rostislavich of Rostov is buried in the crypt below the cathedral.)\nThe Hypatian (Ipatevskaia) Chronicle called Mstislav the \"Jewel\" (\u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) of the Russian princes, saying that he warred only for glory, despised gold and silver, gave all his booty to the church and was universally loved.Mstislav's son, Mstislav Mstislavich Udaloy (The Daring), born by his first wife, was one of the most important princes of Rus' in the decades before the Mongol Invasion, and one of the few to escape from the Battle of Kalka River alive.  Mstislav Rostislavich also had two sons by his second wife: Vladimir and David.\nIn literature, Mstislav is addressed by the narrator in The Tale of Igor's Campaign along with his brother Roman, when the narrator calls on the great princes of Rus to band together to fight the nomadic invaders.  Mstislav, however, had been dead six years before Igor's campaign took place, so the call to arms would have gone unheeded.  Mstislav's brothers, Riurik and David are also addressed in an earlier stanza of the poem.Mstislav is, as Georgii (his baptismal name) a canonized saint of the Russian Orthodox Church.  His feast day is 14 OS/27 June NS.  His remains were uncovered in 1634 and found to be incorrupt.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

His father was a friend and strong supporter of the legendary Nebraska politician William Jennings Bryan. A year after the boy's birth, the Davis family moved to Missouri, where Davis attended schools in Chillicothe and Kansas City.  At 14, he quit school and was employed in several jobs including printer's apprentice, steamfitter's helper, chimney sweep, electrician, detective and journalist.\nIn 1916, Davis gained his first experience in journalism, working with the Denver Times and Albuquerque Morning Journal. He acquired further experience in journalism writing for the Army newspaper The Pontanezan Duckboard while serving in the United States Army Intelligence Corps (1917-1919) during World War I.  Upon his return to the United States, Davis, with the exception of a few months working for the Burns Detective Agency, spent the years between 1919 and 1937 working for various newspapers, including Denver Post (1919), Rocky Mountain News (1920-1922), San Francisco Examiner (1921), Seattle Post-Intelligencer (1930), and Buffalo Times (1931-1937).\nDavis' fiction efforts were first published by a number of pulp magazines during the 1920s.\nIn 1926, he married artist and writer Martha Wirt. Their only child, historian David Brion Davis, was born on February 16, 1927, in Denver, Colorado.\nDavis resided in Hamburg, New York in the late 1930s. He wrote a number of novels and short stories before the publication of his novel The Anointed in 1937. The Book of the Month Club chose The Anointed as its selection for August 1937 and MGM adapted the novel in 1945 to the MGM movie  Adventure starring Clark Gable and Greer Garson. Following the success of The Anointed, Davis left journalism for a career in creative writing.  For the most part he focused on writing novels and short stories, other than a brief period of syndicate work in Europe for PM and Knight newspapers in 1941, two months in Hollywood as a screenwriter, and two years as an associate editor for Rinehart and Company (1943-1945).  Davis was awarded a Huntington Hartford fellowship for the years 1956-1957. Over his career, he wrote more than 20 novels, including The Great American Novel (1938) and The Rebellion of Leo Maguire (1944).\nThe Anointed is about an uneducated egotist who, convinced God has some great purpose in view for him, travels the globe and then takes up book-learning to discover what it is. The Great American Novel (1938) is a humorous novel about a newspaperman who dreams of writing the Great American Novel, but never has the time.\nHis memoir The Age of Indiscretion (1950) was a curmudgeonly retort to nostalgia for the \"good old days\" circa 1900. He argued that the America of the mid-20th century was not only richer and healthier than the America of his boyhood, but also happier and more moral.\nIn 1946, Davis and his family moved to Salisbury, Connecticut, where he was an active citizen (serving as Justice of the Peace between 1947 and 1957) until his death in Salisbury on July 19, 1962.

These allegations have repeatedly been proven to be untrue, as seen in an apology published by The Times in 2021, admitting that \"having considered his sister's safety, and in line with police advice, the Earl offered the Princess of Wales a number of properties included Wormleighton Manor, the Spencer family's original ancestral home\".Diana was buried on Spencer's ancestral estate, Althorp, where he built a garden temple memorial and a museum to her memory, displaying her wedding dress and other personal effects. The museum was opened to the public in 1998 with all profits going to Diana's Memorial Fund, also set up by Spencer. At this stage, Spencer began writing a series of books dealing with the estate itself and with his family history, beginning with an account of his ancestral home, Althorp: the Story of an English House, published in 1998.\nIn 2003, Spencer founded the Althorp Literary Festival.

Decius was one of the first among a long succession of Roman emperors (Illyrian emperors) to originate from the Danube provinces, often referred to as Illyricum. Unlike some of his immediate imperial predecessors such as Philip the Arab or Maximinus Thrax who did not have extensive administrative experience before assuming the throne, Decius was a distinguished senator who had served as suffect consul in 232, had been governor of Moesia and Germania Inferior soon afterwards, served as governor of Hispania Tarraconensis between 235 and 238, and was urban prefect of Rome during the early reign of Emperor Philip the Arab.Around 245, Philip entrusted Decius with an important command on the Danube. By the end of 248 or 249, Decius was sent to quell the revolt of Pacatian and his troops in Moesia and Pannonia; some modern historians see this rebellion as a reflection of emerging Balkan separatism. After the collapse of the revolt, Decius let the troops proclaim him emperor. Philip advanced against him and was killed at Verona, Italy, in September 249. The Senate then recognized Decius as emperor, giving him the attribute Traianus in reference to Emperor Trajan.

He had initially become the Standard's film critic in 1948 and later became film critic for Vogue. For 18 years he was a regular participant in BBC Radio 4's talk show Stop The Week.\nDuring this time he also wrote two novels, The Victors (Dell 1963) and Kill Three (Collins 1967); the Preep series of children\u2019s books; and two serious books on the impact of television, The Ravenous Eye (Cassel 1973) and The Least Worst Television in the World (Barrie and Jenkins 1973), as well as a 90-minute play for BBC 2 also called Kill Three from which the novel was adapted. (The Victors was unique in being a novelization of the Carl Foreman screenplay about American soldiers in WWII, which was itself based upon Alexander Baron's book of short stories about British WWII soldiers, The Human Kind. Baron declined to write the novelization himself, wanting it to have an authentic-sounding American voice and avoid retreading his own work; but nonetheless also wanted to select the novelist and maintain control over the project. As the book's copyright registration, assigned to Baron, particularizes, Baron engaged Shulman to write the novelization as a work for hire.)\nShulman and his fellow critic Herbert Kretzmer co-wrote the story for the film comedy Every Home Should Have One (1970); the screenplay derived from it was written by the film's star, Marty Feldman, along with Barry Took and Denis Norden; after which the material circled back to Shulman and Kretzmer who novelized the script\u2014and as a movie tie-in edition, it was published in paperback by Hodder & Stoughton to coincide with the film's release.\nShulman received the IPA Award as Critic of the Year 1966. In 1956, he wrote a scathing review of a musical Wild Grows the Heather based on a J. M. Barrie play, The Little Minister. Directed by Ralph Reader, who also wrote the lyrics, it received an ovation on its first night but Shulman and other critics knew that this was because Reader had given out first night tickets to the boys taking part in one of his Boy Scout productions and told them to go along and give the piece a good reception. Among other things, Shulman said that the plot \"moved at the pace of cold porridge going uphill.\"\nIn 1980, he was instrumental in setting up the London Theatre Associate awards for new and revived works undertaken by fringe, community based and touring companies.\nIn 1994, three years after Milton Shulman had retired from theatre reviewing, The Observer critic Michael Coveney published The Aisle is Full of Noises, a spirited \"vivisection of the live theatre\" which he arranged in the form of a diary, including some witty if not entirely flattering references to Shulman, while bracketing him with \"the kosher butchers \u2014 Herbert Kretzmer, Bernard Levin and David Nathan\".\nShulman took great offence, as reported in The Times newspaper diary of 21 September 1994: \"Solicitors are trying to hammer out a deal to prevent court action against Nick Hern, the small publisher of the offending work. \"I thought the comments were in the spirit of the book,' pleads Coveney. 'I rather regret that Milton, of whom I am actually rather fond, didn't take them in that spirit.' Shulman is tight-lipped, 'There are negotiations going on at the moment.

Her paternal grandfather, Khwaja Muhammad Sharif, was first a wazir to Tatar Sultan the governor of Khurasan, and later was in the service of Shah Tahmasp, who made him the wazir of Isfahan, in recognition of his excellent service. For unknown reasons, Ghiyas Beg's family had suffered a reversal in fortunes in 1577 and soon found circumstances in their homeland intolerable. Hoping to improve his family's fortunes, Ghiyas Beg chose to relocate to India where the Emperor Akbar's court was said to be at the centre of the growing trade industry and cultural scene.Halfway along their route the family was attacked by robbers who took from them their remaining meager possessions. Left with only two mules, Ghiyas Beg, his pregnant wife, and their two children (Muhammad Sharif, Asaf Khan) were forced to take turns riding on the backs of the animals for the remainder of their journey. When the family arrived in Kandahar, Asmat Begum gave birth to their second daughter. The family was so impoverished they feared they would be unable to take care of the newborn baby. Fortunately, the family was taken in by a caravan led by the merchant noble Malik Masud, who would later assist Ghiyas Beg in finding a position in the service of Emperor Akbar. Believing that the child had signaled a change in the family's fate, she was named Mehr-un-Nissa or \u2018Sun among Women\u2019.

In 152 BC, Laodice became one of the supporters for her brother Alexander Balas, who revolted and overthrew the Seleucid king Demetrius I Soter, who was their maternal half-brother/cousin.\nThe other alternative is Laodice appears to have come from obscure origins, connected with the same impostorship as Alexander Balas. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates V. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain.

His recordings for Motown in the 1960s and 1970s shaped that label's signature sound. His work with Motown gave him the titles Prince of Soul and Prince of Motown. Critics stated that Gaye's music \"signified the development of black music from raw rhythm and blues, through sophisticated soul to the political awareness of the 1970s and increased concentration on personal and sexual politics thereafter\". As a Motown artist, Gaye was among the first to break from the reins of its production system, paving the way for Stevie Wonder. Gaye's late 1970s and early 1980s recordings influenced contemporary forms of R&B predating the subgenres quiet storm and neo-soul.Artists including Barry White, Stevie Wonder, Frankie Beverly and many others admitted to being heavily influenced by Gaye's musicianship. For his Oscar-nominated role as James \"Thunder\" Ealy in the film, Dreamgirls, Eddie Murphy replicated Gaye's 1970s clothing style in the film.\nAccording to David Ritz in a 1991 revision of his biography on Marvin, \"since 1983, Marvin's name has been mentioned\u2014in reverential tones\u2014on no less than seven top-ten hit records.\" Gaye's name has been used as the title of several hits, including Big Sean's \"Marvin Gaye & Chardonnay\" and Charlie Puth's debut hit, \"Marvin Gaye\", a duet with Meghan Trainor. Marvin is also referred to in the 1983 Spandau Ballet hit \"True\", which mentions \"Listening to Marvin all night long...\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

After the birth of three sons, the couple grew apart during the turbulent years of the Napoleonic Wars while Ludwig was in the battlefields.After a gap of eleven years, Princess Wilhelmine went on to have four more children, but court rumors attributed the biological paternity of the second set of children to Baron August von Senarclens de Grancy, Grand Master of the stables of the Grand Duke of Hesse.

While Prince Ludwig officially recognized the children as his, he and his wife became estranged by 1827. Her ancestry chart below assumes her legitimacy.

Baker's ancestry is unknown\u2014her mother, Carrie, was adopted in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1886 by Richard and Elvira McDonald, both of whom were former slaves of African and Native American descent. Baker's estate identifies vaudeville drummer Eddie Carson as her natural father despite evidence to the contrary. In 1993, Josephine Baker's foster son Jean-Claude Baker published a biography titled Josephine: The Hungry Heart, which was the culmination of decades of exhaustive research into Baker's life and career. In the book, he discusses at length the circumstances surrounding Baker's birth:\n\nThe records of the city of St. Louis tell an almost unbelievable story. They show that (Baker's mother) Carrie McDonald ... was admitted to the (exclusively white) Female Hospital on May 3, 1906, diagnosed as pregnant. She was discharged on June 17, her baby, Freda J. McDonald having been born two weeks earlier. Why six weeks in the hospital? Especially for a black woman (of that time) who would customarily have had her baby at home with the help of a midwife? ... The father was identified (on the birth certificate) simply as \"Edw\"... I think Josephine's father was white \u2013 so did Josephine, so did her family...people in St. Louis say that (Baker's mother) had worked for a German family (around the time she became pregnant)... I have unraveled many mysteries associated with Josephine Baker, but the most painful mystery of her life, the mystery of her father's identity, I could not solve. The secret died with Carrie, who refused to the end to talk about it. She let people think Eddie Carson was the father, and Carson played along, (but) Josephine knew better.\nJosephine McDonald spent her early life on 212 Targee Street (known by some St. Louis residents as Johnson Street) in the Chestnut Valley neighborhood of St. Louis, a racially mixed low-income area near Union Station, consisting mainly of rooming houses, brothels, and apartments without indoor plumbing. She was poorly dressed, hungry as a child, and developed street smarts playing in the railroad yards of Union Station.Her mother married Arthur Martin, \"a kind but perpetually unemployed man\", with whom she had a son and two more daughters. She took in laundry to make ends meet, and, at eight years old, Josephine began working as a live-in domestic for white families in St. Louis. One woman abused her, burning Josephine's hands when the young girl put too much soap in the laundry.\nIn 1917, when she was 11, a terrified Josephine McDonald witnessed racial violence in East St. Louis. In a speech years later, she recalled what she had seen:I can still see myself standing on the west bank of the Mississippi looking over into East St. Louis and watching the glow of the burning of Negro homes lighting the sky. We children stood huddled together in bewilderment ... frightened to death with the screams of the Negro families running across this bridge with nothing but what they had on their backs as their worldly belongings... So with this vision I ran and ran and ran...\nBy age 12, she had dropped out of school. At 13, she worked as a waitress at the Old Chauffeur's Club at 3133 Pine Street. She also lived as a street child in the slums of St. Louis, sleeping in cardboard shelters, scavenging for food in garbage cans, making a living with street-corner dancing. It was at the Old Chauffeur's Club that Josephine met Willie Wells, whom she married at age 13, but the marriage lasted less than a year. Following her divorce from Wells, she found work with a street performance group called the Jones Family Band.In her teens, she struggled to have a healthy relationship with her mother, who opposed her becoming an entertainer and scolded her for not tending to her second husband, William Howard Baker, whom she had married in 1921, at age 15. She soon left him when her vaudeville troupe was booked into a New York City venue. They divorced in 1925, during a period when her career success was beginning.

(Other officials tried to dissuade Xu, pointing out the high expenses of sacrificing to heaven and earth during Tang Dynasty, but Xu pointed out that Tang's ceremonies were overly wasteful and that proper ceremonies could be carried out without incurring the same high expenses that Tang expended.)In 923, Wu's nominal ally Later Tang's emperor Emperor Zhuangzong (Li Cunxu), in his campaign against their joint enemy Later Liang, had just captured the strategically important city of Yun Prefecture (\u9106\u5dde, in modern Tai'an, Shandong), and he personally wrote to Yang Pu, asking for the two states to jointly attack Later Liang.  However, by this point, Wu was beginning to see Later Tang as a threat as well, and Xu considered sending a fleet north, and using it to aid whichever side prevailed.  The official Yan Keqiu pointed out that he would have no good excuse not to commit to a position if Later Liang then requested aid as well, and so Xu did not launch the fleet.Later in the year, Emperor Zhuangzong, in a surprise attack, captured the Later Liang capital Daliang.  Later Liang's emperor Zhu Zhen committed suicide before the city fell, ending Later Liang, and Later Tang took over Later Liang's territory.  Xu, in fear of what the Later Tang emperor might do next, blamed Yan for dissuading him from sending the fleet, but Yan pointed out that Emperor Zhuangzong had become arrogant in his victory and was not ruling his state well, predicting that within a few years his state would be in turmoil.  Meanwhile, Later Tang's emissary to Wu initially delivered an edict from Emperor Zhuangzong, but Wu, not viewing itself as a Later Tang subject, refused to accept it.  Emperor Zhuangzong rewrote his communication as a letter (thus showing equality between the states), but slightly displayed superiority by addressing the letter, \"The letter from the Emperor of the Great Tang to the Lord of Wu.\"  Yang Pu responded, also with a letter (thus also showing equality) but also showed deference by addressing the letter, \"The respectful letter from the Lord of the Great Wu to the Emperor of the Great Tang.\"  Shortly after, he also sent the official Lu Ping (\u76e7\u860b) as an emissary to Later Tang.  Upon Lu's return, he confirmed Yan's observations -\u2013 that Emperor Zhuangzong was wasting his time on tours and games, and was stingy with his funds, not willing to dispense them to soldiers, and thus causing discontent.While Xu was in firm control of the Wu governance, in 924 Yang Pu was able to show some measure of sovereignty.  At that time, there was an occasion when went to the port of Baisha (\u767d\u6c99, in modern Yangzhou) to review the fleet, and he changed Baisha's name to Yingluan Base (\u8fce\u947e, \"Base that Welcomed the Emperor's Train\").  Xu, who was then stationed at Jinling with Xu Zhigao at Jiangdu overseeing the government on his behalf, came to pay homage to him, and Yang Pu used this chance to complain about Xu's associate Zhai Qian (\u7fdf\u8654), whom Xu had put in control of the palace, as Zhai had put much restrictions on the King's movements and was spying on the King's moves.  (Yang initiated the complaint by intentionally referring to rain (\u96e8, yu) as \"water\" (\u6c34, shui), as Zhai's father's name was Zhai Yu, and Yang claimed that he, even as sovereign, felt so intimidated by Zhai that he had to observe naming taboo for Zhai's father.)  Xu, realizing Yang's complaint, bowed and offered to put Zhai to death, but Yang stated that that was unnecessary but that an exile would be sufficient, so Xu exiled Zhai to Fu Prefecture (\u64ab\u5dde, in modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi).In 925, Qian Liu, the king of Wu's southeastern neighbor Wuyue (formally a vassal of Later Tang's), sent an emissary to Wu to inform Wu that he had been created the King of Wuyue by Emperor Zhuangzong.  Wu, under the rationale that Wuyue was having designs on its own territory by accepting a title that included \"Wu\" in its name, refused to receive the emissary, and further cut off diplomatic and trade relations with Wuyue.In 926, Emperor Zhuangzong was killed in a mutiny at the Later Tang capital Luoyang.  His adoptive brother Li Siyuan, who led another mutiny and who shortly after arrived at Luoyang, declared himself emperor (as Emperor Mingzong) to succeed him.  Yang sent an emissary to him to establish friendly relations (and offering fresh tea leaves as a tribute), but also internally declared a period for Emperor Zhuangzong.In 927 there was an incident when the senior general Chai Zaiyong (\u67f4\u518d\u7528) came to pay homage to the emperor, but was wearing his armor -\u2013 which was inappropriate, and he was indicted by an imperial censor.  Chai, however, citing his battlefield accomplishments, refused to accept the punishment.  However, Xu Zhigao then tried to restore discipline by intentionally \"accidentally\" intruding into the palace, and then immediately withdrawing and submitting a petition asking to be punished for this intrusion.  Yang issued an edict declining any punishment, but Xu Zhigao insisted on being punished by being stripped of one month's salary.  It was said that this move restored discipline among the Wu officials.Meanwhile, as the years went by, Xu Wen's biological son Xu Zhixun was repeatedly trying to persuade Xu Wen to have him replace Xu Zhigao as the overseer of the Wu government, and Xu Wen's associates Yan and Xu Jie were advocating the same, but Xu Wen was hesitant because Xu Zhigao was filially pious and careful, and his concubine Lady Chen also argued against it, pointing out that Xu Zhigao had been a son to him ever since the time that he was of low position, and should not now be abandoned.  However, by late 927 he had resolved to do so, so he was preparing to go to Jiangdu from Jinling to urge Yang Pu to declare himself as emperor, and then use that opportunity to reassign both Xu Zhixun and Xu Zhigao.  As he was about to depart Jinling, however, he became ill, and so he sent Xu Zhixun in his stead.  Xu Zhigao, hearing the news, prepared to resign and request the post of military governor of Zhennan Circuit (\u93ae\u5357, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), but while Xu Zhixun was on the way, Xu Wen died.  Xu Zhixun rushed back to Jinling to take care of the aftermaths of his father's death, and Xu Zhigao remained as junior regent.  Yang posthumously created Xu Wen the Prince of Qi.Shortly after, pursuant to Xu Wen's last wishes, Yang declared himself emperor.

Although he long tried to get both countries to adopt a closer political union, the kingdoms of Scotland and England remained individual sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, both ruled by James in personal union. He was the longest-reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Scotland.\nJames was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. He succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was forced to abdicate in his favour. Four different regents governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1589, he married Anne of Denmark. Three of their children survived to adulthood: Henry Frederick, Elizabeth, and Charles. In 1603, James succeeded his cousin Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland, who died childless. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known as the Jacobean era, until his death in 1625. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, returning to Scotland only once, in 1617, and styled himself \"King of Great Britain and Ireland\". He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland. In his reign, the Plantation of Ulster and English colonisation of the Americas began.\nAt 57 years and 246 days, James's reign in Scotland was the longest of any Scottish monarch. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament. Under James, the \"Golden Age\" of Elizabethan literature and drama continued, with writers such as William Shakespeare, John Donne, Ben Jonson, and Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture. James himself was a prolific writer, authoring works such as Daemonologie (1597), The True Law of Free Monarchies (1598), and Basilikon Doron (1599). He sponsored the translation of the Bible into English later named after him, the Authorized King James Version, and the 1604 revision of the Book of Common Prayer. Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed \"the wisest fool in Christendom\", an epithet associated with his character ever since. Since the latter half of the 20th century, historians have tended to revise James's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch. He was strongly committed to a peace policy, and tried to avoid involvement in religious wars, especially the Thirty Years' War that devastated much of Central Europe. He tried but failed to prevent the rise of hawkish elements in the English Parliament who wanted war with Spain. He was succeeded by his second son, Charles I.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He was the only child of Emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes and Empress Irene Laskarina. His mother was the eldest daughter of Theodore I Laskaris, who had established the Empire of Nicaea as a successor state to the Byzantine Empire in Asia Minor after the crusaders captured the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Theodore received an excellent education from two renowned scholars, Nikephoros Blemmydes and George Akropolites. He made friends with young intellectuals, especially with a page of low birth, George Mouzalon. Theodore began to write treatises on theological, historical and philosophical themes in his youth.\nEmperor John III arranged for Theodore to marry Elena Asenina in 1235, to forge an alliance with her father, Ivan Asen II, Emperor of Bulgaria, against the Latin Empire of Constantinople. According to Theodore himself, their marriage was happy, and they had five or six children. From 1241, Theodore acted as his father's lieutenant in Asia Minor during his frequent military campaigns in the Balkan Peninsula. From around 1242, he was his father's co-ruler, but was not crowned as co-emperor. During this period, his relationship with some prominent aristocrats, particularly Theodore Philes and Michael Palaiologos, grew tense.\nTheodore succeeded his father on 4 November 1254. He dismissed many high officials and army commanders of aristocratic origin, replacing them with loyal friends, including some of low birth. The same year, he made a defensive alliance with Kaykaus II, the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, against the Mongol Empire. In 1256, he repelled a Bulgarian invasion of Thrace and Macedonia and forced Michael II Komnenos Doukas, the ruler of Epirus, to cede Dyrrachium on the coast of the Adriatic Sea to Nicaea. He reformed the military, recruiting more soldiers from among the native peasantry of Asia Minor. Eventually, Michael II of Epirus forged an alliance with Stefan Uro\u0161 I, King of Serbia, and Manfred of Sicily against Nicaea. Theodore's newly appointed generals could not resist their joint invasion in 1257. Theodore fell seriously ill and could rarely take part in state administration during the last months of his life. He appointed George Mouzalon regent for his underage son, John IV, before dying of either chronic epilepsy or cancer. In ten days, Mouzalon fell victim to an aristocratic plot, and Michael Palaiologos assumed the regency, usurping the throne soon after.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The Eran stone inscription of Samudragupta states that he had brought \"the whole tribe of kings\" under his suzerainty, and that his enemies were terrified when they thought of him in their dreams. The inscription does not name any of the defeated kings (presumably because its primary objective was to record the installation of a Vishnu idol in a temple), but it suggests that Samudragupta had subdued several kings by this time. The later Allahabad Pillar inscription, a panegyric written by Samudragupta's minister and military officer Harishena, credits him with extensive conquests. It gives the most detailed account of Samudragupta's military conquests, listing them in mainly geographical and partly chronological order. It states that Samudragupta fought a hundred battles, acquired a hundred wounds that looked like marks of glory, and earned the title Prakrama (valourous). The Mathura stone inscription of Chandragupta II describes Samudragupta as an \"exterminator of all kings\", as someone who had no equally powerful enemy, and as a person whose \"fame was tasted by the waters of the four oceans\".Modern scholars offer various opinions regarding Samudragupta's possible motivations behind his extensive military campaigns. The Allahabad Pillar inscription suggests that Samudragupta's aim was the unification of the earth (dharani-bandha), which suggests that he may have aspired to become a Chakravartin (a universal ruler). The Ashvamedha performances by the Nagas, whom he defeated, may have influenced him as well.

However, Bahram III was considered a weak ruler by the other nobles, who decided to pledge allegiance to Narseh, the last remaining son of Shapur, and someone who was perceived as being a stronger leader and one who would be able to bring glory to Iran. Four months into Bahram III's reign, Narseh was summoned to Mesopotamia at the request of many members of the Iranian nobility. He met them in the passage of Paikuli in the province of Garmekan, where he was firmly approved and likely also declared shah for the first time. The reasons behind the nobles favour of Narseh might have been due to his jurisdiction as governor, his image as an advocate of the Zoroastrian religion and as an insurer for harmony and prosperity of the empire. His ancestry from the early Sasanian family probably also played a role.In order to avoid bloodshed, Narseh proposed to make peace with both Bahram III and Wahnam. Both seem to have agreed, as no accounts of battles have been made. The reason behind Bahram III and Wahnam's quick agreement to peace may have been due to desertion amongst many of Bahram III's men. Bahram III abdicated as shah and was probably spared, whilst Wahnam was executed when Narseh entered the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. Narseh then summoned the aristocrats to take part in the royal referendum, a ritual which had been used since the first Sasanian shah, Ardashir I (r.\u2009224\u2013242), and which Narseh now made use of in order to gain the approval of the aristocracy as a legitimate ruler instead that of a usurper.

Sophia was given what was considered a suitable education for princesses at the time by private tutors. She was trained in fencing, a sport normally reserved for males, to strengthen her back and correct her posture.\nSophia socialized with academics and artists, and the court of Nassau was considered more democratic than what was usual at most German courts. She learned the English language early on and felt sympathy for the British parliamentarian system. The language spoken in her childhood home was not German but English. Sophia was given what has been referred to as an upbringing more similar to the middle-class Victorian life style, which she preferred rather than a royal one. Her brothers used to refer to her as Unsere demokratische Schwester (our democratic sister). She was described as serious, intelligent and dutiful, and interested in language and history: she was also genuinely religious.\nIn 1848, she witnessed a rebellion in the Duchy of Nassau, which was suppressed by her mother and brothers. She spent the winter of 1853-54 with her mother at the court of her maternal aunt in Saint Petersburg in Russia. Her maternal aunt, Princess Charlotte of W\u00fcrttemberg, was married to Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich of Russia. The trip was not made to arrange a marriage with a Russian prince because her mother did not wish her to convert, which would have been necessary, but rather, to have her study the life in a grand court. During her stay in Russia, she was a student of the pianist Anton Rubinstein. Sophia and her mother were forced to leave Russia at the outbreak of the Crimean war.

Following the death of his elder brother Gustaf in 1852, he had become the future heir to the Swedish throne because his brother, the reigning Crown Prince, was unable to have more children with his spouse. It was therefore politically necessary for Oscar to marry. In 1855-56, Oscar was sent to visit various royal courts in Europe in order to find a suitable marriage partner in both rank and to his own taste. He visited the British court but did not wish to marry Princess Mary of Cambridge, and the Belgian and Prussian princesses who had been suggested did not wish to marry him. The marriage of Sophia and Oscar should not be regarded as an arranged marriage: Oscar had been given the freedom to choose a princess he liked from the many courts he visited, and Sophia, who had previously been proposed to, did not wish to be pressured into marriage. Sophia and Oscar, however, fell in love with each other.After the visit, Oscar returned to Sweden to ask for his parents' consent to marry, which was granted. He then returned to Nassau, where the engagement was made in September and announced in October. During the engagement, Sophia was educated in the Swedish language and history, and corresponded with her future spouse: soon, the correspondence was conducted in Swedish.

Upon his death the following year, her father Friedrich inherited ownership and control. Her sister Barbara was born in 1887 (d. 1972), but the absence of a male heir put the future of the company in doubt.\nFriedrich Krupp died in 1902, leaving Bertha as the heiress to the Krupp interests. However, it was considered unsuitable for a woman to exercise control over the vast Krupp coal, steel and state-connected armaments empire. Kaiser Wilhelm II personally led a search for a suitable husband for Bertha and successfully proposed Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach, a professional diplomat of good family and a familiar figure at the Kaiser's court. They were married on October 15, 1906  and Bertha became sole owner of the company with Gustav adding the name Krupp to his surname and assuming executive control of the company. Barbara received a large cash settlement in lieu.\nGustav and Bertha had eight children: Alfried (1907\u20131967), Arnold (1908-1909), Claus (1910\u20131940), Irmgard (1912\u20131998), Berthold (1913\u20131987), Harald (1916\u20131985), Waldtraut (1920\u20132005) and Eckbert (1922\u20131945). Of these only Alfried as the eldest son took the surname Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach. The others used the surname von Bohlen und Halbach. Claus and Eckbert were killed on active service in World War II, and Harald spent ten years in captivity in the Soviet Union.\nDuring World War I, the Krupp company manufactured large mortars that the German army used to bombard forts in Belgium and France. German troops nicknamed these Dicke Bertha (\"Big Bertha\") after Bertha Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach. Allied troops used the translated name, \"Big Bertha,\" to refer to all German long-range artillery, particularly those that shelled Paris in 1918. However, \"Big Bertha\" entered the lexicon due to the Paris Gun, a piece of German artillery which was constructed of three artillery barrels welded together. It had a range of 75 miles and its appearance was a major surprise to Parisians in 1917 who had previously only come under attack from German aircraft, since previous artillery reached a maximum of thirty miles.\nAfter Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach suffered a stroke in 1941, his health declined sharply. In 1943 Adolf Hitler issued a decree known as the Lex Krupp, which passed full ownership of the Krupp empire\u2014which was vital to Germany's war effort\u2014from Bertha to her son Alfried, who then assumed control of the company. Bertha took Gustav to a family estate in Tyrol, where they remained until the end of the war.\nIn 1945 Gustav was indicted as a war criminal, but was declared medically unfit to stand trial. He died in 1950. Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach was indicted on charges of crimes against humanity in relation to the Krupp company's use and mistreatment of concentration camp inmates as slave labour in Krupp factories\u2014particularly at the Berthawerk, a factory near the Markstadt forced labour camp, which was named after Bertha. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison and the confiscation of all his property. He served five years in prison before being freed in 1951 when the US High Commissioner in Germany, John J. McCloy, granted clemency, after deciding that there was no danger of a Nazi revival.\nIn 1951 Bertha Krupp returned with Alfried to Essen, where Alfried resumed control of the company and rapidly restored it to a dominant position in the German economy, (although it no longer made armaments).

Her family had strong links to Greece, as her paternal grandfather Gaius Avidius Nigrinus had served at an unknown date during the reign of Roman Emperor Domitian (81-96) as Proconsul of Achaea, a position in which her great uncle Titus Avidius Quietus had also served. Her family may have been related to the consul Gaius Petronius Pontius Nigrinus, who had served his consulship at the time that the Roman Emperor Tiberius had died in 37.\nAvidia's father was executed in 118 on orders from the Roman Senate, because he was one of four senators involved in a failed plot to overthrow the Roman Emperor Hadrian.

Some of them supported Esen Buqa, while others supported his older brother, Yunus Khan. The party of Yunus Khan, however, found themselves a minority and fled to the Timurid Ulugh Beg.\nWith Yunus Khan's departure, Esen Buqa was the uncontested khan. The first few years of his reign went by smoothly; all of the Moghuls were loyal to him, while the town of Kashgar, which had been captured by the Timurids after Uwais Khan had died, was retaken in 1435. However, the Amirs thought little of Esen Buqa, who had ascended the throne while still a child. They began to resent his authority and the country fell into a state of disorder. The khan moved to Aksu and after some time managed to regain the loyalty of the amirs. As result he gave his daughter Daulat Nigar Khanim in marriage to Muhammad Haidar Mirza, son of Dughlat Amir of Kashgar Sayyid Ali.\nSoon after he had regained control of Moghulistan, Esen Buqa began to conduct raids into the territory of Timurids of Transoxiana.

Jarvis moved to Philippi, Barbour County, (West) Virginia with her family when her father, a Methodist minister, was transferred to a church in that town.  In 1850, she married Granville Jarvis, the son of a Baptist minister, who became a successful merchant in nearby Taylor County. Two years later, in 1852, the couple moved to Webster, where Granville established a mercantile business.The Jarvis family, like many families during the mid-1800s, experienced frequent tragedy and loss. Jarvis bore between eleven and thirteen children over the course of seventeen years. Of these children, only four survived to adulthood. The others died of diseases such as measles, typhoid fever, and diphtheria, epidemics of which were common in Appalachian communities in Taylor County. These losses inspired Jarvis to take action to help her community combat childhood diseases and unsanitary conditions.Jarvis was a dynamic woman who saw needs in her community and found ways to meet them. In 1858, while pregnant with her sixth child, Jarvis began Mothers' Day Work Clubs in the towns of Grafton, Pruntytown, Philippi, Fetterman, and Webster to improve health and sanitary conditions. She and other area women joined a growing public health movement in the United States. Jarvis' clubs sought to provide assistance and education to families in order to reduce disease and infant mortality. These clubs raised money to buy medicine and to hire women to work in families where the mother suffered from tuberculosis or other health problems. They developed programs to inspect milk long before there were state requirements. Club members visited households to educate mothers and their families about improving sanitation and overall health. The clubs benefited from the advice of  Jarvis' brother, James Reeves, a physician who was known for his work in the typhoid fever epidemics in northwestern Virginia.During the American Civil War (1861-1865), sentiment in western Virginia was sharply divided between north and south. In 1863, this culminated when the western part of the state broke away from Virginia and formed the new state of West Virginia, which was loyal to the Union. Western Virginia became the location of some of the first conflicts of the Civil War. Jarvis' Mothers' Day Work Clubs altered their mission to meet the changing demands brought about by war. Ann Jarvis urged the clubs to declare neutrality and to provide aid to both Confederate and Union soldiers. Jarvis illustrated her resolve to remain neutral and aid both sides by refusing to support a proposed division of the Methodist Church into a northern and southern branch. Additionally, she reportedly offered a lone prayer for Thornsbury Bailey Brown, the first Union soldier killed by a Confederate in the area, when others refused. Under her guidance, the clubs fed and clothed soldiers from both sides who were stationed in the area. When typhoid fever and measles broke out in the military camps, Jarvis and her club members nursed the suffering soldiers from both sides at the request of a commander.Jarvis' efforts to keep the community together continued after the Civil War ended. After the fighting concluded, public officials seeking ways to eliminate post-war strife called on Jarvis to help. She and her club members planned a \"Mothers Friendship Day\" for soldiers from both sides and their families at the Taylor County Courthouse in Pruntytown to help the healing process. Despite threats of violence, Jarvis successfully staged the event in 1868. She shared with the veterans a message of unity and reconciliation. Bands played \"Dixie\" and the \"Star Spangled Banner\" and the event ended with everyone, north and south, joining to sing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" This effective and emotional event reduced many to tears. It showed the community that old animosities were destructive and must end.Near the end of the Civil War, in 1864, the Jarvis family moved to Grafton in order to aid Granville's business ventures as an innkeeper and land speculator. Jarvis continued her social activist work. Throughout her life, Jarvis taught Sunday School and was very involved with the Methodist church. In Grafton, Jarvis was involved in the Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church's construction and subsequently taught Sunday school classes there. She served as superintendent of the Primary Sunday School Department at the church for twenty-five years. Jarvis also was a popular speaker and often lectured on subjects ranging from religion, public health, and literature for audiences at local churches and organizations. Her lectures included, \"Literature as a Source of Culture and Refinement,\" \"Great Mothers of the Bible,\u201d Great Value of Hygiene for Women and Children,\u201d and \"The Importance of Supervised Recreational Centers for Boys and Girls.\u201d Throughout her life, Jarvis strove to honor and help mothers. Her daughter Anna recalled her praying for someone to start a day to memorialize and honor mothers during a Sunday school lesson in 1876. On the first anniversary of Jarvis' death, Anna met with friends and announced plans for a memorial service remembering her mother for the next year. In May 1907, a private service was held in honor of Jarvis. The following year, in 1908, Anna organized the first official observance of Mother's Day, coming near the anniversary of her mother's death. Andrews Methodist Church held the first public service on the morning of May 10, 1908. Anna did not attend the service, but sent a donation of 500 white carnations for all of those in attendance. In the afternoon, 15,000 people attended another service that Anna organized in Philadelphia, held at the Wanamaker Store Auditorium.In the years following the initial ceremonies, Anna's new holiday gained recognition in many states and spread to a number of foreign countries. Anna also embarked on a mission to make Mother's Day an officially recognized holiday in the United States. She succeeded when, in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson signed a congressional resolution officially making the second Sunday in May the national Mother's Day and calling for Americans to recognize it by displaying the flag.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Within weeks of his death, George Peele remembered him as \"Marley, the Muses' darling\"; Michael Drayton noted that he \"Had in him those brave translunary things / That the first poets had\" and Ben Jonson even wrote of \"Marlowe's mighty line\". Thomas Nashe wrote warmly of his friend, \"poor deceased Kit Marlowe,\" as did the publisher Edward Blount in his dedication of Hero and Leander to Sir Thomas Walsingham. Among the few contemporary dramatists to say anything negative about Marlowe was the anonymous author of the Cambridge University play The Return from Parnassus (1598) who wrote, \"Pity it is that wit so ill should dwell, / Wit lent from heaven, but vices sent from hell\".\nThe most famous tribute to Marlowe was paid by Shakespeare in As You Like It, where he not only quotes a line from Hero and Leander (\"Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might, 'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?'\") but also gives to the clown Touchstone the words \"When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.\" This appears to be a reference to Marlowe's murder which involved a fight over the \"reckoning,\" the bill, as well as to a line in Marlowe's Jew of Malta, \"Infinite riches in a little room.\"\n\nShakespeare was much influenced by Marlowe in his work, as can be seen in the use of Marlovian themes in Antony and Cleopatra, The Merchant of Venice, Richard II and Macbeth (Dido, Jew of Malta, Edward II and Doctor Faustus, respectively). In Hamlet, after meeting with the travelling actors, Hamlet requests the Player perform a speech about the Trojan War, which at 2.2.429\u2013432 has an echo of Marlowe's Dido, Queen of Carthage. In Love's Labour's Lost Shakespeare brings on a character \"Marcade\" (three syllables) in conscious acknowledgement of Marlowe's character \"Mercury\", also attending the King of Navarre, in Massacre at Paris. The significance, to those of Shakespeare's audience who were familiar with Hero and Leander, was Marlowe's identification of himself with the god Mercury.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was one of the principal figures of the period known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.\nBorn in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland, Shackleton and his Anglo-Irish family moved to Sydenham in suburban south London when he was ten. Shackleton's first experience of the polar regions was as third officer on Captain Robert Falcon Scott's Discovery Expedition of 1901\u20131904, from which he was sent home early on health grounds, after he and his companions Scott and Edward Adrian Wilson set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82\u00b0S. During the Nimrod Expedition of 1907\u20131909, he and three companions established a new record Farthest South latitude of 88\u00b023\u2032 S, only 97 geographical miles (112 statute miles or 180 kilometres) from the South Pole, the largest advance to the pole in exploration history. Also, members of his team climbed Mount Erebus, the most active Antarctic volcano. On returning home, Shackleton was knighted for his achievements by King Edward VII.\nAfter the race to the South Pole ended in December 1911, with Roald Amundsen's conquest, Shackleton turned his attention to the crossing of Antarctica from sea to sea, via the pole. To this end, he made preparations for what became the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914\u20131917. The expedition was struck by disaster when its ship, Endurance, became trapped in pack ice and finally sank in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica on 21 November 1915. The crew escaped by camping on the sea ice until it disintegrated, then by launching the lifeboats to reach Elephant Island and ultimately the South Atlantic island of South Georgia, enduring a stormy ocean voyage of 720 nautical miles (1,330 km; 830 mi) in Shackleton's most famous exploit. He returned to the Antarctic with the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition in 1921, but died of a heart attack while his ship was moored in South Georgia. At his wife's request, he remained on the island and was buried in Grytviken cemetery. The wreck of Endurance was discovered just over a century after Shackleton's death.Away from his expeditions, Shackleton's life was generally restless and unfulfilled. In his search for rapid pathways to wealth and security, he launched business ventures which failed to prosper, and he died heavily in debt. Upon his death, he was lauded in the press but was thereafter largely forgotten, while the heroic reputation of his rival Scott was sustained for many decades. Later in the 20th century, Shackleton was \"rediscovered\", and became a role model for leadership in extreme circumstances. In his 1956 address to the British Science Association, one of Shackleton's contemporaries, Sir Raymond Priestley, said \"Scott for scientific method, Amundsen for speed and efficiency but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton\", paraphrasing what Apsley Cherry-Garrard had written in a preface to his 1922 memoir The Worst Journey in the World.

Through her mother\u2019s previous marriages, she had various maternal half-brothers and sisters and two full blooded brothers who served as Seleucid kings Antiochus V Eupator and Alexander Balas.  In 152 BC, Laodice became one of the supporters for her brother Alexander Balas, who revolted and overthrew the Seleucid king Demetrius I Soter, who was their maternal half-brother/cousin.\nThe other alternative is Laodice appears to have come from obscure origins, connected with the same impostorship as Alexander Balas. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates V. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain. The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice VI.\nAfter 152 BC, Laodice married King Mithridates V of Pontus, who reigned from 150\u2013120 BC. Mithridates V and Laodice VI were related, as her husband had lineage from the Seleucid dynasty. Little is known regarding her relationship with her husband or her reign as Pontian queen. During their marriage, Laodice bore Mithridates V seven children: Laodice (I) (by marriage Queen consort of Cappadocia), Mithridates VI of Pontus, Mithridates Chrestus, Laodice (II) (by marriage Queen consort of Pontus), Nysa (sometimes spelt as Nyssa), Roxana and Statira. Nysa, Roxana and Statira were put to death after the fall of the Kingdom of Pontus in 63 BC.\nMithridates V was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held. In the will of Mithridates V, he left the kingdom to the joint rule of Laodice, Mithridates VI and Mithridates Chrestus. Both of her sons were underage to rule and Laodice retained all power as regent.Laodice in her regency favored her second son over her first son. During her regency 120\u2013116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC), Mithridates VI escaped from the plotting of his mother and had gone into hiding. She enjoyed luxuries that made her a compliant client of Rome. She accepted bribes from the Roman Republic and her extravagance pushed Pontus into debt.Mithridates VI between 116\u2013113 BC returned to Pontus from hiding and was hailed king. He was able to remove his mother and his brother from the Pontian throne, thus Mithridates VI became the sole ruler of Pontus. Mithridates VI show clemency towards his mother and brother, by imprisoning them both.

In the summer of 1891, then pregnant with her only child, she was introduced by Edward to the Russian exile Feliks Volkhovsky, who began teaching her Russian. He also introduced her to his fellow exile and colleague Sergius Stepniak and his wife Fanny. Soon after, Garnett began working with Stepniak, translating Russian works for publication; her first published translations were A Common Story by Ivan Goncharov, and The Kingdom of God is Within You by Leo Tolstoy. The latter was published while she was making her first trip to Russia in early 1894.  After visits to Moscow and Saint Petersburg, she travelled to Yasnaya Polyana where she met Tolstoy; although the latter expressed interest in having her translate more of his religious works, she had already begun working on the novels of Turgenev and continued with that on her return home.  Initially she worked with Stepniak on her translations; after his untimely death in 1895, Stepniak's wife Fanny worked with her. From 1906, her favourite amanuensis was a young Russian woman, Natalie Duddington whom she had met in Russia and in whom she found \"real intellectual companionship\".Over the next four decades, Garnett produced English-language versions of dozens of volumes by Tolstoy, Gogol, Goncharov, Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, Ostrovsky, Herzen and Chekhov.\nHer son and only child, David Garnett, trained as a biologist and later wrote novels, including the popular Lady into Fox (1922).\nBy the late 1920s, Garnett was frail and half-blind. She retired from translating after the publication in 1934 of Three Plays by Turgenev. After her husband's death in 1937, she became reclusive. She developed a heart condition, with attendant breathlessness, and in her last years had to walk with crutches. She died at The Cearne, Crockham Hill, Kent, at the age of 84.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The birth caused controversy when it was announced that Queen Victoria would seek relief from the pains of delivery through the use of chloroform administered by Dr John Snow. Chloroform was considered dangerous to mother and child and was frowned upon by the Church of England and the medical authorities. Queen Victoria was undeterred and used \"that blessed chloroform\" for her last pregnancy. A fortnight later, Queen Victoria reported in her journal, \"I was amply rewarded and forgot all I had gone through when I heard dearest Albert say 'It's a fine child, and a girl!'\" Albert and Queen Victoria chose the names Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore: Mary after Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester, the last surviving child of King George III of the United Kingdom; Victoria after the Queen; and Feodore after Feodora, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the Queen's older half-sister. She was baptised in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace on 16 June 1857. Her godparents were the Duchess of Kent (maternal grandmother); the Princess Royal (eldest sister); and the Prince Frederick of Prussia (her future brother-in-law).\nFrom birth, Beatrice became a favoured child. The elder favourite daughter of Prince Albert, the Princess Royal, was about to take up residence in Germany with her new husband, Frederick (\"Fritz\") of Prussia.

In his absence, the Franks elected the Roman commander Aegidius as their king. Childeric's exile corresponds to the period between Aegidius' appointment as magister militum for Gaul in 456 or 457 and his death in 465. When Childeric returned from exile, Bisinus' wife Basina abandoned her husband to go with him. She became his wife and the mother of Clovis I. Gregory does not describe Bisinus as king of the Thuringians or even as a Thuringian himself, but as king \"in Thuringia\". Gregory's account was used by the authors of the 7th-century Chronicle of Fredegar and the 8th-century Book of the History of the Franks.Scholars have been skeptical of Gregory's account. It has been called a \"folk tale\", albeit one that corresponds well chronologically to the dates of Aegidius' magistracy. It has been suggested that Gregory in fact confused the civitas Tungrorum (today Tongeren) in northern Gaul with Thuringia and that Childeric was exiled to Tongeren. It has even been suggested that Gregory, knowing only that the name of Clovis' mother was Basina and that an early king of Thuringia was named Bisinus, invented the relationship between Basina and Bisinus based on the similarity of their names (having already, possibly erroneously, presumed the location of exile to be Thuringia). Although most scholars accept Childeric's exile as historical, Berthold Schmidt rejected Gregory's entire account of it as a fiction.It is highly unlikely (but not impossible) that the Bisinus of Gregory and the Bisinus of the Lombard chronicles are one and the same. In that case Bisinus would have been married to Basina almost eighty years before his youngest son's death in battle and had a living grandchild in 587. Taking Gregory's account as historical, it has been suggested therefore that there were in fact two kings named Bisinus. Bisinus (II), husband of Menia, may then have been the nephew of Bisinus (I), husband of Basina. The alternative is that Gregory misused the name of the historical Bisinus, husband of Menia and grandfather of Radegund, in reconstructing the events of the 460s.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Later chronicles, for instance the Illuminated Chronicle, which sought to prove the lawful origin of Andrew III, were ignoring these details and emphasized that Beatrice wanted to return home voluntarily.Stephen was named after Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary, by which Queen Beatrice sought to emphasize the legitimate origin of her son. The exiled queen with her infant began her journey to Ferrara six months later. She was planning to live in the court of his uncle, but Marquis Azzo VII denied her request and refused to return her former estates. She spent the following years wandering in Italy, but did not receive significant financial support to promote her son's cause. Finally, Pope Innocent IV granted her revenues of 35 monasteries in Italy, in order to stabilize her financial condition. Beatrice sent her 7-year-old son Stephen to the court of Azzo VII at Ferrara in 1243, where he spent his childhood and received knightly education. He was also betrothed to Isabella, daughter of Pietro II Traversari. Beatrice never gave up her son's claims to receive ducal revenues from Hungary. She tried to persuade the Republic of Venice to support Stephen during the war with Hungary, but the Serenissima promised King B\u00e9la IV that it would not support Beatrice and her son in their peace of 30 June 1244, which ended the Dalmatian campaign.

In Antoku's absence, the cloistered former-Emperor Go-Shirakawa then elevated his young brother by decree; and the young child was given the acceptance of abdication (juzen) rites.

Thus, the senso and sokui of Go-Toba became the first in history to omit the ritual transmission of the sacred treasures from a sovereign to his successor.In 1192 Go-Shirakawa died and the first shogunate was established by Minamoto no Yoritomo, and the emperor became a figurehead.In 1198, Go-Toba abdicated in favor of his son, Emperor Tsuchimikado.\nGo-Toba reigned as cloistered Emperor from 1198 till 1221 during reigns of three emperors, but his power was more limited than former cloistered Emperors in the Heian period.\nIt was during this time that Go-Toba decreed that the followers of the Pure Land sect in Ky\u014dto, led by H\u014dnen, be banished or in some cases executed.

Having developed a life-threatening fever, the king summoned the High Court in June and made Guy regent. Baldwin retained only the royal title and the city of Jerusalem. Guy proved far too unpopular to be an effective military leader, and gravely insulted the incapacitated king by refusing to exchange Jerusalem for Tyre.Saladin attacked Kerak Castle in late 1183 while the wedding of Sibylla's half-sister Isabella to Humphrey of Toron was celebrated. Baldwin summoned his troops. Not trusting him to efficiently command the army, the king deprived Guy of regency and, effectively, of his place in the line of succession. The succession was then deliberated by the assembled nobility, which included Guy, Agnes, Bohemond of Antioch, Raymond of Tripoli, Raynald of Sidon, and the Ibelin brothers, but not Sibylla's supporters Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon and Joscelin of Courtenay. Eventually Agnes's proposal that Sibylla's five-year-old son, Baldwin V, be crowned co-king was accepted because his was the next strongest claim after Sibylla's. The coronation took place on 20 November, and the boy received the homage of all the barons except his stepfather. Baldwin IV and his army then relieved the siege of Kerak.\nThe question of who would rule the kingdom as regent for Baldwin V troubled the disabled king. Sibylla and Guy would have the best claim to regency if Baldwin IV died. Her brother knew that this could only be prevented by having their marriage annulled and discussed the matter with the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Heraclius. Baldwin failed to take into account Sibylla's steadfast devotion to Guy as well as Guy's friendship with Heraclius, who may have warned the count about Baldwin's intentions. Instead of going to Jerusalem with the rest of the army after lifting the siege of Kerak, Guy went straight to Ascalon and sent a message to Sibylla, who joined him there. The annulment could not proceed without their presence, and the couple's refusal to leave Ascalon despite the king's summons frustrated the scheme to separate them. Baldwin next attempted to confiscate Jaffa and Ascalon, but only succeeded in revoking Jaffa.On Baldwin IV's deathbed in early 1185, the right to rule the kingdom as regent in the name of Baldwin V, then a sickly child, was offered to the count of Tripoli. Raymond accepted the regency on the condition that the pope should, on the advice of the Holy Roman emperor and the kings of England and France, decide whether the crown should pass to Sibylla or Isabella in case of Baldwin V's premature death. The High Court accepted the conditions and swore an oath to him in the presence of Baldwin IV. Guardianship of the boy was awarded to his granduncle Joscelin of Courtenay. Raymond's party were determined to prevent Sibylla's accession; they questioned her legitimacy on the basis of the annulment of her parents' marriage and emphasized that her half-sister, Isabella, was born to a reigning king. The latter argument, resting on the Byzantine idea of being \"born in the purple\", may have come from Isabella's Byzantine mother, Maria Komnene. Baldwin IV died in March 1185 or before 16 May 1185 at the latest, when Sibylla's son, Baldwin V, is recorded as the sole king. Baldwin V's paternal grandfather, Marquis William V of Montferrat, arrived in Jerusalem to safeguard the young king's rights.", "hasanswer": false}]}

From 1968 to 1969, during the Vietnam War, Kerry served an abbreviated four-month tour of duty in South Vietnam. While commanding a Swift boat, he sustained three wounds in combat with the Viet Cong, for which he earned three Purple Heart Medals. Kerry was awarded the Silver Star Medal and the Bronze Star Medal for valorous conduct in separate military engagements. After completing his active military service, Kerry returned to the United States and became an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War. He gained national recognition as an anti-war activist, serving as a spokesperson for the Vietnam Veterans Against the War organization. Kerry testified in the Fulbright Hearings before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, where he described the United States government's policy in Vietnam as the cause of war crimes.\nIn 1972, Kerry entered electoral politics as a Democratic candidate for the United States House of Representatives in Massachusetts's 5th congressional district. Kerry won the Democratic nomination but was defeated in the general election by his Republican opponent. He subsequently worked as a radio talk show host in Lowell and as the executive director of an advocacy organization while attending the Boston College School of Law. After obtaining his juris doctor in 1976, Kerry served from 1977 to 1979 as the first assistant district attorney of Middlesex County, where he tried criminal cases and managed the district attorney's office. After a period in private legal practice, he was elected the 66th lieutenant governor of Massachusetts in 1982. In 1984, Kerry was elected to the United States Senate. As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, he led a series of hearings investigating narcotics trafficking in Latin America, which exposed aspects of the Iran\u2013Contra affair. He was reelected to additional terms in 1990, 1996, 2002 and 2008.\nKerry won the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 2004, alongside vice presidential nominee and North Carolina Senator John Edwards. Kerry campaigned as a critic of Republican President George W. Bush's prosecution of the Iraq War and advocated a liberal domestic policy. He lost the Electoral College and the popular vote by slim margins, winning 251 electors to Bush's 286 and 48.3% of the popular vote to Bush's 50.7%. Kerry remained in the Senate and chaired the Committee on Foreign Relations from 2009 to 2013.\nIn January 2013, Kerry was nominated by Obama to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and was confirmed by his Senate colleagues on a vote of 94 to 3. He was U.S. secretary of state throughout the second term of the Obama administration from 2013 to 2017. During his tenure, he initiated the 2013\u20132014 Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace talks and negotiated agreements restricting the nuclear program of Iran, including the 2013 Joint Plan of Action and the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. In 2015, Kerry signed the Paris Agreement on climate change on behalf of the United States.\nAt the end of the Obama administration in January 2017, Kerry remained active in public affairs from 2017 to 2021 as a vocal opponent of Obama's successor, President Donald Trump. Kerry returned to government in January 2021, becoming the first person to hold the new position of U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, under Joe Biden. On January 13, 2024, sources close to Kerry revealed that he would be leaving this position to work on the Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "40_707", "question": "Who is Stenkil's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_71090", "text": "The Hervarar saga (13th century) describes Stenkil as the son of Ragnvald the Old and Astrid Njalsdotter, the daughter of Njal Finnsson from H\u00e5logaland in Norway and a cognatic descendant of Harald Fairhair. Later historians have identified the father of Stenkil as Ragnvald Ulfsson who was the earl of Ladoga and the grandson of the legendary Viking Skoglar Toste, but this presumed family-connection is not supported by any other sources and must therefore be regarded as very uncertain. The Icelandic sagas mention a wife and two sons of Ragnvald Ulfsson but none are identified with Stenkil and his mother Astrid. The contemporary chronicler Adam of Bremen says Stenkil was the nephew (nepos) or stepson (privignus) of the former King Emund the Old, while the Hervarar saga asserts that he was related to the previous dynasty by marriage to Emund's daughter.Stenkil was probably from V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland rather than Uppland or the M\u00e4laren area. The short chronicle appended to the Westrogothic law (c. 1240) clearly states that he spent time in Levene in V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland where he was long remembered as the king who \"loved West Geats before all his other subjects\", and he was lauded as a great archer whose hit marks were long shown with admiration. The tradition that Stenkil was beloved by the Geats appears to be supported by Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla. In a speech by Thorvid, the lawspeaker (lagman) of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland before a battle with Harald Hardrada (see below), the lawspeaker expresses the Geats' (Gautland people) loyalty to Stenkil:\n\nThe lagman of the Gautland people, Thorvid, sat upon a horse, and the bridle was fastened to a stake that stood in the mire.  He broke out with these words: \"God knows we have many brave and handsome fellows here, and we shall let King Steinkel hear that we stood by the good earl bravely.  I am sure of one thing: we shall behave gallantly against these Northmen, if they attack us; but if our young people give way, and should not stand to it, let us not run farther than to that stream; but if they should give way farther, which I am sure they will not do, let it not be farther than to that hill.\"\nThe statement of the Hervarar saga that Stenkil was originally Jarl in Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0 (in the first hand, the provinces around Lake M\u00e4laren) nevertheless calls for some caution. Historian Peter Sawyer argues that the traditions associating Stenkil with V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland may not be reliable, but rather express a later need to advocate V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland as the hub of the Swedish kingdom. His active advocacy for a bishopric in Sigtuna may speak for a strong association with the M\u00e4laren Valley.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Upon his coronation, Zhu Changluo adopted the era name \"Taichang\" (literally \"grand prosperity\") for his reign, hence he is known as the Taichang Emperor.\nThe first few days of his reign started promisingly enough as recorded in the Ming histories. Two million taels of silver was entailed as a gift to the troops guarding the border, important bureaucratic posts left vacant during the Wanli Emperor's long periods of administrative inactivity were finally starting to be filled, and many of the deeply unpopular extraordinary taxes and duties imposed by the Wanli Emperor were also revoked at this time. However, ten days after his coronation, the Taichang Emperor became so ill that celebrations for his birthday (by Chinese calculation) were cancelled.According to non-official primary sources, the Taichang Emperor's illness was brought about by excessive sexual indulgence after he was presented with eight maidens by Lady Zheng. The emperor's already serious condition was further compounded by severe diarrhoea after taking a dose of laxative, recommended by an attending eunuch Cui Wensheng on 10 September. Finally on 25 September, to counter the effects of the laxative, he asked for and took a red pill presented by a minor court official named Li Kezhuo, who dabbled in apothecary.\nIt was recorded in official Ming histories that the Taichang Emperor felt much better after taking the red pill, regained his appetite and repeatedly praised Li Kezhuo as a \"loyal subject\". That same afternoon, the emperor took a second pill and was found dead the next morning on 26 September 1620.The death of an emperor who was seemingly in good health within the span of a month sent shock waves through the Ming Empire and rumours started spreading. The much talked about mystery surrounding the Taichang Emperor's death became known as the infamous \"Case of the Red Pills\" (\u7ea2\u4e38\u6848), one of three notorious 'mysteries' of the late Ming dynasty. Consort Kang of the Li Clan was also involved in this matter. The fate of Li Kezhuo, whose pills were at the center of this controversy, became a hotly contested subject between competing power factions of officials and eunuchs vying for influence at the Ming imperial court. Opinions ranged from awarding him money for the emperor's initial recovery to executing his entire family for murdering the emperor. The question was finally settled in 1625 when Li Kezhuo was exiled to the border regions on the order of the powerful eunuch Wei Zhongxian, signalling the total dominance of eunuchs during the reign of the Taichang Emperor's son, the Tianqi Emperor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Despite his young age, Philip quickly proved himself an effective ruler beloved by his people in the Low Countries, pursuing policies that favored peace and economic development, while maintaining a steady course of the government building.\nIn 1496, Philip's father arranged for him to marry Joanna, the second daughter of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon. Around the same time, Philip's sister, Margaret, was given in marriage to Joanna's brother John, Prince of Asturias. After the deaths of her brother John, sister Isabella, and nephew Miguel, Joanna became heiress presumptive to the thrones of Castile and Aragon. Most of Philip's time in Spain was spent consolidating his power, often leading to conflicts with his wife and her father. Joanna became queen of Castile when her mother died in 1504. Philip was proclaimed king in 1506, but died a few months later, leaving his wife distraught with grief. Joanna's father, Ferdinand II of Aragon, and her own son, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, were quick to seize power, confining the queen for the rest of her life on account of her alleged insanity.Philip was the first Habsburg monarch in Spain, and every Spanish monarch since his son Charles V has been one of his descendants. Philip died before his father, and therefore never inherited his father's territories or became Holy Roman Emperor. However, his son Charles eventually united the Habsburg, Burgundian, Castilian, and Aragonese inheritances.

In his\nReconquista effort Alfonso pushed as far as Teruel, conquering this important\nstronghold on the road to Valencia in 1171. The same year saw him capturing Caspe.\nApart from common interests, kings of Aragon and Castile were united by a formal bond of vassalage the former owed to the latter. Besides, on January 18, 1174, in Zaragoza Alfonso married Sancha, sister of the Castilian king. Another milestone in this alliance was the Treaty of Cazorla between the two kings in 1179, delineating zones of conquest in the south along the watershed of the rivers J\u00facar and Segura. Southern areas of Valencia including Denia were thus secured to Aragon. Alfonso also reached an agreement, the Treaty of Sang\u00fcesa (1168), with Sancho VI of Navarre dividing the territory of the Taifa of Murcia between them.\nDuring his reign Aragonese influence north of the Pyrenees reached its zenith, a natural tendency given the affinity between the Occitan, Catalan and Aragonese dominions of the Crown of Aragon. His realms incorporated not only Provence (from 1166 or just before), but also the counties of Cerdanya (1168) and Roussillon (inherited in 1172). B\u00e9arn and Bigorre paid homage to him in 1187. Alfonso's involvement in the affairs of Languedoc, which would cost the life of his successor, Peter II of Aragon, for the moment proved highly beneficial, strengthening Aragonese trade and stimulating emigration from the north to colonise the newly reconquered lands in Aragon.\nIn 1186, he helped establish Aragonese influence in Sardinia when he supported his cousin Agalbursa, the widow of the deceased Judge of Arborea, Barison II, in placing her grandson, the child of her eldest daughter Ispella, Hugh, on the throne of Arborea in opposition to Peter of Serra.\nAlfonso II provided the first land grant to the Cistercian monks on the banks of the Ebro River in the Aragon region, which would become the site of the first Cistercian monastery in this region. The Monasterio de Piedra was founded in 1194 with thirteen monks from Poblet Monastery, in an old castle next to the Piedra river, the Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda was founded in 1202 and utilized some of the first hydrological technology in the region for harnessing water power and river diversion for the purpose of building central heating.

{"id": "40_720", "question": "Who is George Hamilton's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "26_50570", "text": "In early 1780, Elizabeth went to stay with her aunt, Gertrude Schuyler Cochran, in Morristown, New Jersey, where she met Alexander Hamilton, one of Continental Army commander George Washington's aides-de-camp, who was stationed with Washington and his men in Morristown for the winter of 1780. Elizabeth and Hamilton had met once before, but only briefly, when Hamilton dined with the Schuylers on his way back from a negotiation on Washington's behalf. Also while in Morristown, Eliza met and became friends with Martha Washington, a friendship they maintained for the rest of their husbands' respective political careers. Eliza later said of Martha Washington, \"She was always my ideal of a true woman.\"After meeting Elizabeth in Morristown, Hamilton was so excited that he reportedly returned to the Continental Army's Morristown headquarters and had forgotten the password to gain admission to it. The relationship between Eliza and Hamilton quickly grew; even after he left Morristown a month later on a short mission to negotiate a prisoners exchange. While on the prisoner exchange, Hamilton wrote to Eliza, continuing their relationship through letters. \nAfter completing the prisoner exchange negotiations, Hamilton returned to Morristown, where Elizabeth's father had arrived in his capacity as representative of the Continental Congress. In some of the correspondence between Hamilton and Elizabeth, there had been some talk in at least one letter of a \"secret wedding\". In early April 1780, they were officially engaged with her father's blessing, which was something of an anomaly for the Schuyler girls with Elizabeth's two sisters, Angelica and Catherine, both eloping. \nHamilton followed the Continental Army when they decamped from Morristown in June 1780. In September that year, Eliza learned that Major John Andr\u00e9, head of the British Secret Service, had been captured in a foiled plot concocted by General Benedict Arnold to surrender the fort of West Point to the British. Andr\u00e9 was once been a house guest in the Schuyler Mansion in Albany as a prisoner of war en route to the Province of Pennsylvania in 1775; Eliza, then seventeen, might have had a juvenile crush on the young British officer who had once sketched for her. Hamilton, while envious of Andr\u00e9 for his actions during the war, promised Eliza he would do what he could to treat the British intelligence chief accordingly; he even begged Washington to grant Andr\u00e9's last wish of execution by firing squad instead of by hanging, but he was hanged to death despite the request. After two more months of separation punctuated by their correspondence, on December 14, 1780, Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler were married at the Schuyler Mansion.\nAfter a short honeymoon at the Pastures, Eliza's childhood home in Albany, New York, Hamilton returned to the Continental Army and the Revolutionary War in early January 1781. Eliza soon joined him in New Windsor, New York, where Washington's Continental Army was now stationed, and she rekindled her friendship with Martha Washington as they entertained their husbands' fellow officers. Soon, however, Washington and Hamilton had a falling out, and the newlywed couple moved, first back to Eliza's father's house in Albany, then to a new home across the river from the New Windsor headquarters. There, Eliza busied herself in creating a home for them and in aiding Alexander with his political writings, including parts of his 31-page letter to Robert Morris, in which Hamilton communicated his extensive understanding of government finance, which he later employed as the nation's first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury during Washington's presidency. Parts of the letter to Morris are in Eliza's handwriting.Soon, however, Eliza moved again, this time back to her parents' house in Albany. This may have coincided with the discovery that she was pregnant with their first child, who was born the following January and named Philip, in honor of Eliza's father. While apart, Alexander wrote her numerous letters assuring her not to worry for his safety; in addition, he wrote her concerning confidential military secrets, including the lead-up to the Battle of Yorktown that autumn. Meanwhile, the Revolutionary War began raging close to her home, when a group of British soldiers stumbled upon her residence at the Pastures, seeking supplies. According to some accounts, the family was spared from any losses thanks to her sister Peggy, who told the British soldiers that her father had gone to town to get help, which caused them to flee from the area.After the Battle of Yorktown, which was won decisively by American forces and led the British to recognize their defeat in the war, Alexander rejoined Eliza in Albany, where they remained for almost another two years prior to relocating to New York City in late 1783. Earlier that year, Angelica and her husband John Barker Church, for business reasons, moved to Europe. Angelica lived abroad for over 14 years, returning to the United States twice in 1785 and again in 1789. On September 25, 1784, Eliza gave birth to her second child, Angelica, named after Eliza's older sister.In 1787, Eliza sat for a portrait, painted by Ralph Earl while Earl was being held in debtors' prison. Alexander heard of Earl's predicament and asked if Eliza might be willing to sit for him, to allow him to make some money and eventually buy his way out of prison, which he subsequently did. At this time, she and Alexander had three young children; their third child, Alexander Jr., was born in May 1786, and she may have been pregnant then with their fourth child, James Alexander, who was born the following April.The same year, in 1787, Eliza and Alexander took into their home Frances (Fanny) Antill, the two-year-old youngest child of Hamilton's friend Colonel Edward Antill, whose wife had recently died. In October that year, Angelica wrote to Alexander, \"All the graces you have been pleased to adorn me with fade before the generous and benevolent action of my sister in taking the orphan Antle  [sic] under her protection.\" Two years later, Colonel Antill died in Canada, and Fanny continued to live with the Hamiltons for another eight years, until an older sister was married and able to take Fanny into her own home. Later, James Alexander Hamilton would write that Fanny \"was educated and treated in all respects as [the Hamiltons'] own daughter.\"The Hamiltons had an active social life, often attending the theater and various balls and parties. \"I had little of private life in those days,\" she would remember. At the first Inaugural Ball, Eliza danced with George Washington; when Thomas Jefferson returned from Paris in 1790, she and Alexander hosted a dinner for him. After Alexander became Treasury Secretary in 1789, her social duties increased. \"Mrs. Hamilton, Mrs. [Sarah] Jay and Mrs. [Lucy] Knox were the leaders of official society,\" an early historian wrote in 1897. She also managed the Hamilton household; James McHenry once noted to Alexander that Eliza had \"as much merit as your treasurer as you have as treasurer of the United States.\"Eliza also continued to aid Alexander throughout his political career, serving as an intermediary between him and his publisher when he was writing The Federalist Papers, copying out portions of his defense of the Bank of the United States, and sitting up with him so he could read Washington's Farewell Address out loud to her as he wrote it. Meanwhile, she continued to raise her children; a fifth child, John Church Hamilton, was born in August 1792. She maintained their household through multiple moves between New York City, Philadelphia, and Albany. \nWhile in Philadelphia, around November 24, 1794, Eliza suffered a miscarriage in the wake of her youngest child falling extremely ill and her worries over Alexander's absence during his armed suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Hamilton resigned from public office immediately afterwards in order to resume his law practice in New York and remain closer to his family.In 1797, an affair came to light that had taken place several years earlier between Hamilton and Maria Reynolds, a young woman who first approached Hamilton for monetary aid in the summer of 1791. Eliza evidently did not believe the charges when they were first leveled against her husband: John Church, her brother-in-law, on July 13, 1797, wrote to Hamilton that \"it makes not the least Impression on her, only that she considers the whole Knot of those opposed to you to be [Scoundrels].\" After returning home to Eliza on July 22 and assembling a first draft dated July 1797, on August 25, 1797, Hamilton published a pamphlet, later known as the Reynolds Pamphlet, admitting to his one-year adulterous affair in order to refute the charges that he had been involved in speculation and public misconduct with Maria's husband James Reynolds.Eliza was, at the time, pregnant with their sixth child. Despite her advanced pregnancy and her previous miscarriage of November 1794, her initial reaction to her husband's disclosure of his past affair was to leave Hamilton in New York and join her parents in Albany, where their son William Stephen was born on August 4, 1797. She returned to her marital house in New York City in early September 1797, in part because the local doctor had been unable to cure their eldest son Philip, who had accompanied her to Albany and contracted typhus. Eliza and Alexander reconciled and remained married, and had two more children together. The first, Elizabeth, named for Eliza, was born on November 20, 1799. Before their eighth child was born, however, they lost their oldest son, Philip, who died in a duel on November 24, 1801. After being shot on the dueling field, Philip was brought to Angelica and John Church's house, where he died with both of his parents next to him. Their last child, born the next June in 1802, was named Philip in his honor.\nDuring this time, Alexander commissioned John McComb Jr. to construct the Hamilton family home. In 1802, the same year that Philip was born, the house was built and named Hamilton Grange, after Alexander's father's home in Scotland. Eliza and Alexander continued to live together in a caring relationship in their new home that can be seen in letters between the two at the time. When Eliza went away attending her mother's funeral in 1803, Hamilton wrote to her from the Grange Estate, telling her:I am anxious to hear of your arrival at Albany and shall be glad to be informed that your father and all of you are composed. I pray you to exert yourself and I repeat my exhortation that you will bear in mind it is your business to comfort and not to distress.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "40_731", "question": "Who is Ariston of Athens's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_71179", "text": "The specific birthdate of Plato is not known. Based on ancient sources, most modern scholars estimate that Plato was born between 428 and 427 BC. The grammarian Apollodorus of Athens argues in his Chronicles that Plato was born in the first year of the eighty-eighth Olympiad (427 BC), on the seventh day of the month Thargelion; according to this tradition the god Apollo was born this day. According to another biographer of him, Neanthes, Plato was eighty-four years of age at his death. If we accept Neanthes' version, Plato was younger than Isocrates by six years, and therefore he was born in the second year of the 87th Olympiad, the year Pericles died (429 BC).The Chronicle of Eusebius names the fourth year of the 89th Olympiad as Plato's, when Stratocles was archon, while the Alexandrian Chronicle mentions the eighty-ninth Olympiad, in the archonship of Isarchus. According to Suda, Plato was born in Aegina in the 88th Olympiad amid the preliminaries of the Peloponnesian war, and he lived 82 years. Sir Thomas Browne also believes that Plato was born in the 88th Olympiad. Renaissance Platonists celebrated Plato's birth on November 7. Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff estimates that Plato was born when Diotimos was archon eponymous, namely between July 29 428 BC and July 24 427 BC. Greek philologist Ioannis Kalitsounakis believes that the philosopher was born on May 26 or 27, 427 BC, while Jonathan Barnes regards 428 BC as year of Plato's birth. For her part, Debra Nails asserts that the philosopher was born in 424/423 BC.Plato's birthplace is also disputed. Diogenes La\u00ebrtius states that Plato \"was born, according to some writers, in Aegina in the house of Phidiades the son of Thales\". Diogenes mentions as one of his sources the Universal History of Favorinus. According to Favorinus, Ariston and his family were sent by Athens to settle as cleruchs (colonists retaining their Athenian citizenship), on the island of Aegina, from which they were expelled by the Spartans after Plato's birth there. Nails points out, however, that there is no record of any Spartan expulsion of Athenians from Aegina between 431 and 411 BC. On the other hand, at the Peace of Nicias, Aegina was silently left under Athens control, and it was not until the summer of 411 that the Spartans overran the island. Therefore, Nails concludes that \"perhaps Ariston was a cleruch, perhaps he went to Aegina in 431, and perhaps Plato was born on Aegina, but none of this enables a precise dating of Ariston's death (or Plato's birth)\". Aegina is regarded as Plato's place of birth by Suda as well.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is often referred to by historians as \"Drusus II\", \"Drusus the Younger\" or \"Drusus Minor\" to distinguish him from his paternal uncle, Nero Claudius Drusus, the younger brother of Tiberius after whom Drusus was named. Drusus was the maternal grandson of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, a close friend of Augustus, and his first wife Caecilia Attica.As a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was a close relative of all five Julio-Claudian emperors. His father was emperor, and his adoptive grandfather was the founder of the Roman Empire, Augustus. On his mother's side, he was the cousin of Caligula, a paternal cousin of Claudius, and a first cousin once removed of Nero \u2013 all future emperors of Rome.Before Tiberius, the heirs of Augustus were the sons of Julia the Elder and Marcus Agrippa, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom he adopted and made heir. They advanced through their careers at the same pace and were going to rule together; however, they died young, forcing Augustus to draw another line of succession. In AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius on condition that Tiberius adopt Germanicus. This made Tiberius the heir of Augustus, and Germanicus the heir of Tiberius. Like the sons of Agrippa, it was the intention of Augustus that Germanicus and Drusus would rule together.Later that year, Drusus was married to his paternal cousin, Livilla, to bring him closer to the Julians. Tacitus says she was unattractive as a child, but grew up to be beautiful.

She was the eldest child of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and was created Princess Royal in 1841. As the eldest child of the British monarch, she was briefly heir presumptive until the birth of her younger brother, the future Edward VII. She was the mother of Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor.\nEducated by her father in a politically liberal environment, Victoria was married at the age of 17 to Prince Frederick of Prussia, with whom she went on to have eight children. Victoria shared with Frederick her liberal views and hopes that Prussia and the later German Empire should become a constitutional monarchy, based on the British model. Criticised for this attitude and for her English origins, Victoria suffered ostracism by the Hohenzollerns and the Berlin court. This isolation increased after the rise to power of Otto von Bismarck, one of her most staunch political opponents, in 1862.\nVictoria was empress for only a few months, during which she had opportunity to influence the policy of the German Empire. Frederick III died in 1888 \u2013 99 days after his accession \u2013 from laryngeal cancer and was succeeded by their son Wilhelm II, who had much more conservative views than his parents. After her husband's death, she became widely known as Empress Frederick (German: Kaiserin Friedrich). The empress dowager then settled in Kronberg im Taunus, where she built Friedrichshof, a castle, named in honour of her late husband. Increasingly isolated after the weddings of her younger daughters, she died of breast cancer in August 1901, less than 7 months after the death of her mother, Queen Victoria, in January 1901.\nThe correspondence between Victoria and her parents has been preserved almost completely: 3,777 letters from Queen Victoria to her eldest daughter and about 4,000 letters from the empress to her mother are preserved and catalogued.

He possibly started this pilgrimage together with his cousin Wartislaw VII of Pomerania-Stolp, who had to break off the journey due to illness.After the death of his father, Wartislaw VI, in 1394, Wartislaw VIII ruled Pomerania-Wolgast jointly with his elder brother Barnim VI.  During their joint reign, they sometimes joined the Hanseatic League in the fight against the piracy.  Sometimes, however, Duke Barnim VI himself operated as a pirate, leading to a tense relationship with the Hanseatic League and the Teutonic Knights.

He settled his dispute with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights in March 1406 and undertook a pilgrimage to Rome, where Pope Gregory XII gave him a Golden Rose.  After his return, Wartislaw gave the Golden Rose to the Pudagla Monastery, where it was soon revered as miraculous.  It was later destroyed by abbott Henry, who ruled 1479\u20131493, because it had become an idol.During his reign, there was an incident in Stralsund, known as the Papenbrand thom Sunde.

In 1413, he concluded an alliance with Frederick and Wartislaw's oldest son, also named Wartislaw, was engaged to Frederick's daughter Margaret.  However, Wartislaw junior died one or two years later, before he could marry Margaret.  Wartislaw VIII and Frederick travelled together to the Council of Constance, where Emperor Sigismund invested Wartislaw as Duke of Pomerania.  However, Wartislaw then had to travel back to Pomerania to deal with riots and could not participate with the council, such as the burning of the heretic John Huss.\nDuke Wartislaw VIII died on 20 August 1415.

Usually accompanied by her husband, children and their Russian entourage, she stayed at Schloss Heiligenberg, the small castle of her brother Alexander, who lived with his morganatic wife and their children at Jugenheim outside Darmstadt. There she met Princess Alice, second daughter of Queen Victoria and wife of her nephew Louis of Hesse. She resisted Alice's suggestion that her brother, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, marry her only daughter Maria, but the couple would wed anyway in 1874. In December 1875, Empress Maria visited England to meet her first British grandchild. Queen Victoria wrote in her diary: \"I thought her very ladylike, kind and amiable. We were at ease at once, but she has a sad expression and looks so delicate. I think we should get on very well together, poor thing. I pity her much.\"\nAfter Princess Alice died in 1878, it was Maria Alexandrovna's turn to pity the British royal family. She invited her motherless relatives to visit during the holidays she spent with brother Alexander at Heiligenberg. It was during these visits that her second youngest son Sergei met his future wife, Alice's second daughter, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine. It was also here that Maria met Elisabeth's youngest surviving sister, Princess Alix, who would eventually become the devoted and ill-fated wife of Maria's eldest grandson, Emperor Nicholas II. A legend alleges that on a visit to Darmstadt, upon meeting Alix, Empress Maria turned to her ladies-in-waiting with the words, \"Kiss her hand. That is your empress to be.\"Tsar Alexander had three children with Princess Dolgorukova, whom he moved into the Imperial Palace during Maria's final illness out of fear that she might become the target of assassins. The affair, in the face of the Tsarina's declining health, served to alienate the rest of his adult children, save their son Alexei and their daughter. When the Grand Duchess Marie made a visit to her mother in May 1880, she was horrified to learn of the imperial mistress' living arrangements and confronted her father. Courtiers spread stories that the dying Empress was forced to hear the noise of Catherine's children moving about overhead, but their rooms were actually far away from each other. After Maria Alexandrovna asked to meet her husband's children with Catherine, he brought their two older children, George and Olga, to her deathbed, where she kissed and blessed both children.

{"id": "40_778", "question": "Who is Margaret of Bar's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_69625", "text": "At the moment of her birth, Margaret's father was preparing to go to France and lead an important military expedition for King Henry VI. Somerset negotiated with the king to ensure that if he were to die, the rights to Margaret's wardship and marriage would be granted only to his wife.As Somerset was a tenant-in-chief of the crown, the wardship of his heir fell to the crown under the feudal system. Somerset fell out with the king after coming back from France and was banished from the royal court pending a charge of treason against him. He died shortly afterwards. According to Thomas Basin, Somerset died of illness, but the Crowland Chronicle reported that his death was a suicide. As his only surviving child, Margaret was heiress to his considerable fortune and inheritor of his contested claim to the throne. Both effectively rendered Margaret, as her biographers Jones and Underwood write, \"a pawn in the unstable political atmosphere of the Lancastrian court\".Upon her first birthday, the king broke the arrangement with Margaret's father and granted the wardship of her extensive lands to William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, although Margaret herself remained in the custody of her mother. Margaret's mother was pregnant at the time of Somerset's death, but the child did not survive and Margaret remained the sole heir. Although she was her father's only legitimate child, Margaret had two maternal half-brothers and three maternal half-sisters from her mother's first marriage whom she supported after her son's accession to the throne.\nMargaret was married to Suffolk's son, John de la Pole. The wedding may have been held between 28 January and 7 February 1444, when she was perhaps a year old but certainly no more than three. However, there is more evidence to suggest they were married in January 1450, after Suffolk had been arrested and was looking to secure his son's future by betrothing him to a conveniently wealthy ward whose children could be potential claimants to the throne. Papal dispensation was granted on 18 August 1450, necessary because the spouses were closely related (Lady Margaret and de la Pole being the great-grandchildren of two sisters, Katherine Swynford and Philippa Chaucer, respectively), and this concurs with the later date of marriage. Three years later, her marriage to de la Pole was dissolved, and King Henry VI granted Margaret's wardship to his own half-brothers, Jasper and Edmund Tudor.Margaret never recognised the marriage to de la Pole. In her will, made in 1472, Margaret refers to Edmund Tudor as her first husband. Under canon law, Margaret was not bound by her first marriage contract as she was entered into the marriage before reaching the age of twelve.Even before the annulment of her first marriage, Henry VI chose Margaret as a bride for his half-brother, Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond. This was likely to strengthen Edmund's claim to the throne should Henry be forced to designate Edmund his heir; the king was then without child or legitimate siblings. Edmund was the eldest son of the king's mother, Catherine of Valois, by Owen Tudor.At nine years old Margaret was required to assent formally to the marriage. Later she claimed she was divinely guided to do so.At age twelve Margaret married Edmund Tudor, twelve years her senior, on 1 November 1455. The Wars of the Roses had just broken out. Edmund, a Lancastrian, was taken prisoner by Yorkist forces less than a year later. He died of the plague in captivity at Carmarthen on 3 November 1456, leaving a 13-year-old widow who was pregnant with their child.The Countess always respected the name and memory of Edmund as the father of her only child. In 1472, sixteen years after his death, Margaret specified in her will that she wanted to be buried alongside Edmund, even though she had enjoyed a long, stable and close marriage with her third husband, who had died in 1471.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Later chronicles, for instance the Illuminated Chronicle, which sought to prove the lawful origin of Andrew III, were ignoring these details and emphasized that Beatrice wanted to return home voluntarily.Stephen was named after Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary, by which Queen Beatrice sought to emphasize the legitimate origin of her son. The exiled queen with her infant began her journey to Ferrara six months later. She was planning to live in the court of his uncle, but Marquis Azzo VII denied her request and refused to return her former estates. She spent the following years wandering in Italy, but did not receive significant financial support to promote her son's cause.

In the absence of French assistance, Odoardo was convinced by Pope Urban VIII to sign a treaty of peace with Spain in 1637.His aggressive rule of Castro, a Farnese fief in the Papal States north of Rome, who the Barberini (Pope Urban's family) were eager to acquire, caused Odoardo to be excommunicated in 1641.

They were chthonic daimones of Mount Ida, who clashed their spears and shields to drown out the wails of infant Zeus, whom they received from the Great Goddess, Rhea, his mother. The infant-god was hidden from his cannibal father and was raised in the  cave that was sacred to the Goddess (Da) celebrated by the Kuretes, whose name it bore and still bears. The names of the two daughters of Melisseus, one called the \"inevitable\" (Adrasteia) and the other simply \"goddess\" (Ida, de) are names used for the Great Mother Rhea herself.\nThe Dionysiaca of Nonnus, learned and accurate in spite of its late date, elaborates and gives all nine names of the Kuretes.The infant god was fed on milk and honey, the milk of the goat-nymph Amaltheia. Melisseus is simply another form of Melissus, also a Cretan \"honey-man,\" remembered by later mythographers as a \"king of Crete.\" Fermented honey, an entheogen that was the gift of the Goddess, preceded the knowledge of wine in Aegean culture. These honey-kings consorting with the Goddess will have combined their position of authority with a sacral role, but modern interpreters would not follow Robert Graves in asserting that Melliseus, \"Adrasteia and Io's reputed father, is really their mother, Melissa\u2014the goddess as Queen-bee, who annually killed her male consort.\"When he came to maturity, Zeus rewarded his nymph nurses with the horn of Amaltheia, the cornucopia or horn of plenty that is always full of food and drink. Callimachus' Hymn to Zeus, full of witty and learned detail on the god's infancy, is at pains to show by etymologies that the mythic figures and geographical features obtained their names, and thus their very identities, through their participation in Zeus' early life. Other poets concur. A less Olympian-minded culture might have suggested that the horn was not actually Zeus' to give, and that it belonged already to the ancient and fertile Minoan-Mycenean nymphs of Crete.\nIn a mythic fragment that explains the connection of early Cretan culture with the island of Rhodes as deriving from Crete, Diodorus Siculus briefly relates that five of the Kuretes sailed from Crete to the Chersonnese (peninsula) opposite Rhodes, with a notable expedition, expelled the Carians who dwelt there, and settling down in the land divided it into five parts, each of them founding a city, which he named after himself.

After Henry's death, initially she had upheld for her son the double title Romanorum et Sicilie Rex, but she abandoned the German claim after the coronation of Frederick in Palermo, May 1198. According to K\u00f6lzer, the Pope had put pressure on Constance and Frederick to abandon the title. Additionally, the death of Henry had left in Germany a power vacuum that a child monarch could not fill. Constance likely realized that Frederick's perspective in Germany was hopeless and supported the claims of her brother-in-law Philip of Swabia, who was supported by a number of the princes against the Welf candidate, Otto IV.Her government displayed a full swing towards the Norman tradition (and rejection of Henry's vision of imperial rule) after her husband's death. She surrounded herself with local advisors and excluded the ambitious Markward von Anweiler from a position of power, attempting to restrict him to his fief in Molise, as well as Walter of Palearia and Conrad I, Duke of Spoleto.  While her own health becoming poor, Constance made warm overtures to the new pope Innocent III, abandoning the long-contended principle that the king was the apostolic legate, a central principle of Norman autonomy in the regno (when Henry was still alive, she had not hesitated to defend her rights as the natural heiress of her Norman forefathers, even against the authority of the Pope).  Faced with the dangers that surrounded any child-king, Constance placed Frederick under the protection of Pope Innocent III, who forced her to cede traditional royal rights over church councils, legates, appeals and elections, leaving her only the right to approve a bishop-elect before he could occupy his see.\nShe issued diplomas jointly with Frederick after his coronation. Constance maintained her title of Holy Roman Empress Dowager, but she tried to keep options open for her son: she accepted the Pope's conditions only as Queen of Sicily and not Empress \u2013 her husband had refused to accepted Sicily as a fief from the Pope all his life, to maintain the dignity of the Empire. That he became much more than King of Sicily could not be predicted when she unexpectedly died in late November 1198, before the cardinal sent by the Pope to receive her homage arrived. In her will she set up a Council of Regency for Sicily and made Innocent, who was the child's feudal suzerain, his guardian, a reminder to all of the inviolability of his inheritance. She also instructed her subjects to swear fidelity to the Pope.\nConstance was buried in the Cathedral of Palermo near the tombs of her father and her husband (and later their son). Her death led to a period of violence and chaos till 1208 when Frederick had grown to his majority.  According to historian Josef De\u00e9r, the tomb that now holds the remains of Constance was actually the one she had commissioned for her husband. In 1215, Frederick had his father reburied in a porphyry sarcophagus taken from Cefal\u00f9 (which was one of the two sarcophagi Roger II had commissioned for himself; according to the emperor's order, the other one was reserved for himself).", "hasanswer": false}]}

He would become known as \"Carl\" by the family except for his English relatives, who translated it as \"Charles\".\nRaised in an increasingly prosperous family, he was trained in his father's banking business and lived at home until age twenty-nine, when he acquired a modest residence at 33 Neue Mainzer Strasse in Frankfurt in preparation for his marriage on 16 September 1818 to Adelheid Herz (1800\u20131853). They would have the following children:\n\nCharlotte (1819\u20131884), who married Lionel de Rothschild\nMayer Carl (1820\u20131886)\nAdolphe Carl (1823\u20131900)\nWilhelm Carl (1828\u20131901)\nAnselm Alexander Carl (1835\u20131854)Wanting to expand the family business across Europe, the eldest Rothschild son (Amschel) remained in Frankfurt, while the other sons were sent to different European cities to establish banking branches. The 1821 occupation of Naples by the Austrian army provided the opportunity for the Rothschilds to set up business in the Kingdom. Carl Rothschild was therefore sent to Naples, where he established C M de Rothschild & Figli to operate as a satellite office of the Rothschild banking family's  headquarters in Frankfurt.Carl Rothschild has sometimes been seen as the least gifted of the five brothers. However, he proved himself in Naples as a strong financial manager and someone very capable at developing all-important business connections. He established a good working relationship with Luigi de' Medici, the \"Direttore della Segreteria di Azienda del Regno di Napoli\" (Finance Minister), and his operation became the dominant banking house in Naples. As a result of Carl's success, the Rothschilds had a substantial banking presence in England and three other major European capitals, giving the family considerable influence and an advantage over their competitors.\nCarl Mayer gained a significant influence with the Bourbon king in Naples. Clients of the Naples bank also included the Vatican, the dukes of Parma and the dukes of Tuscany.In 1822, Carl Rothschild and his four brothers were each granted the title of baron, or Freiherr, by Kaiser Franz I of Austria. During the winter of 1826, Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, future King of the Belgians, was a guest of Carl Freiherr von Rothschild at his villa in Naples.\nIn 1829, Carl was appointed consul-general of Sicily at Frankfurt and in January 1832 the Jewish banker was given a ribbon and star of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George at a ceremony with the new Roman Catholic Pope, Gregory XVI. Reports that Rothschild was permitted to kiss the Pope's hand, rather than his foot, as was customary at the time, led to controversy in the Catholic world that the Pope was selling Rome out to \"a Jew.\"\n\nCarl von Rothschild maintained homes in Frankfurt and in Naples. In 1837, he built the Villa G\u00fcnthersburg on a large country property outside Frankfurt owned by his father, at what is now G\u00fcnthersburg Park. In 1841, he bought the Villa Pignatelli at Riviera di Chiaia, with a spectacular view of the Sea and Vesuvio Volcano. The family lived there until 1860.Two years after his wife Adelheid (n\u00e9e Hertz) died in 1853, and one year after their son Anselm Alexander Carl died at the age of eighteen,  Carl Freiherr von Rothschild died in Naples, \"sad and morose\". One seventh of his estate went to his daughter Charlotte, with the rest divided equally between his three surviving sons. Adolf Carl took over the business in Naples from his father, while Mayer Carl and Wilhelm Carl succeeded their childless uncle Amschel in Frankfurt, even though Carl Mayer had wished his son Mayer Carl would succeed him in Naples. In 1861, the Rotschild bank closed in Naples, and the bank's assets were transferred to Frankfurt.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was a brother of Emperor Alexander III and uncle of Nicholas II, Russia's last monarch.\nHe entered the Russian Army, was a general in the Cavalry and adjutant general to his brother Emperor Alexander III, and a Knight of the Order of St. Andrew. In 1889, he married Princess Alexandra of Greece, his paternal first cousin once removed. The couple had a daughter and a son, but Alexandra died after the birth of their second child. In his widowhood, Grand Duke Paul began a relationship with Olga Valerianovna Karnovich, a married woman with three children. After obtaining a divorce for Olga and in defiance of strong family opposition, Grand Duke Paul married her in October 1902. As he contracted a morganatic marriage with a divorc\u00e9e in defiance of the Tsar's prohibition, Grand Duke Paul was banished from living in Russia and deprived of his titles and privileges.

{"id": "40_809", "question": "Who is Agrippina the Younger's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_71475", "text": "Agrippina became empress in 49 AD upon marrying her uncle Claudius. She also became stepmother to Claudia Antonia, Claudius' daughter and only child from his second marriage to Aelia Paetina; and to the young Claudia Octavia and Britannicus, Claudius' children with Valeria Messalina. Agrippina removed or eliminated anyone from the palace or the imperial court whom she thought was loyal and dedicated to the memory of the late Messalina. She also eliminated or removed anyone whom she considered was a potential threat to her position and the future of her son, one of her victims being Lucius' second paternal aunt and Messalina's mother Domitia Lepida the Younger.\nGriffin describes how Agrippina \"had achieved this dominant position for her son and herself by a web of political alliances,\" which included Claudius chief secretary and bookkeeper Pallas, his doctor Xenophon, and Afranius Burrus: the head of the Praetorian Guard (the imperial bodyguard), who owed his promotion to Agrippina. Neither ancient nor modern historians of Rome have doubted that Agrippina had her eye on securing the throne for Nero from the very day of the marriage\u2014 if not earlier. Dio Cassius observation seems to bear that out: \"As soon as Agrippina had come to live in the palace she gained complete control over Claudius.\"\nIn 49, Agrippina was seated on a dais at a parade of captives when their leader the Celtic King Caratacus bowed before her with the same homage and gratitude as he accorded the emperor. In 50 AD, Agrippina was granted the honorific title of Augusta. She was third Roman woman ( after Livia Drusilla and Antonia Minor) and only the second living Roman woman (the first being Livia) to receive this title.\nIn her capacity as Augusta, Agrippina quickly became a trusted advisor to Claudius, and by AD 54, she exerted a considerable influence over the decisions of the emperor. Statues of her were erected in many cities across the Empire and her face appeared on coins. In the Senate, her followers were advanced with public offices and governorships. She would often to a place outside the imperial court and listened to the Senate from behind the scenes, and Claudius even allowed her to be a separate court and decide on empire matters. Agrippina even signed government documents and officially dealt with foreign ambassadors. She also claimed auctoritas (power of commanding) and Autokrateira (self-ruler as empress) in front of the Senate, the people, and the army. However, this privileged position caused resentment among the senatorial class and the imperial family.\nAlso that year, Claudius founded a Roman colony and called the colony Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis or Agrippinensium, today known as Cologne, after Agrippina who was born there. This was the only Roman colony to be named after a Roman woman. In 51 AD, she was given a carpentum: a ceremonial carriage usually reserved for priests such as the Vestal Virgins and sacred statues. That same year she appointed Sextus Afranius Burrus as the head of the Praetorian Guard, replacing the previous head of the Praetorian Guard, Rufrius Crispinus.\nShe assisted Claudius in administering the empire and became very wealthy and powerful. Ancient sources claim that Agrippina successfully influenced Claudius into adopting her son and making him his successor. Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was adopted by his great maternal uncle and stepfather in 50. Lucius' name was changed to Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus and he became Claudius's adopted son, heir and recognized successor. Agrippina and Claudius betrothed Nero to his step sister Claudia Octavia, and Agrippina arranged to have Seneca the Younger return from exile to tutor the future emperor. Claudius chose to adopt Nero because of his Julian and Claudian lineage.Agrippina deprived Britannicus of his heritage and further isolated him from his father and succession for the throne in every way possible. For instance, in 51 AD, Agrippina ordered the execution of Britannicus' tutor Sosibius. Sosibus had confronted her, outraged by Claudius' adoption of Nero and his choice of Nero as successor over his own son Britannicus.Nero and Octavia were married on June 9, 53 AD. Claudius later regretted marrying Agrippina and adopting Nero and began to favor Britannicus, preparing him for the throne. These actions gave Agrippina a motive to allegedly eliminate Claudius. Ancient sources say she poisoned Claudius on October 13, 54 AD (a Sunday) with a plate of deadly mushrooms at a banquet, thus enabling Nero to quickly take the throne as emperor. Accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident, and according to more modern sources, it is possible that Claudius died of natural causes, being 63 years old. In the aftermath of Claudius's death, Agrippina, who initially kept the death secret, tried to consolidate power by immediately ordering that the palace and the capital be sealed. After all the gates were blockaded and exit of the capital forbidden, she introduced Nero first to the soldiers and then to the senators as emperor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Somerset negotiated with the king to ensure that if he were to die, the rights to Margaret's wardship and marriage would be granted only to his wife.As Somerset was a tenant-in-chief of the crown, the wardship of his heir fell to the crown under the feudal system. Somerset fell out with the king after coming back from France and was banished from the royal court pending a charge of treason against him. He died shortly afterwards. According to Thomas Basin, Somerset died of illness, but the Crowland Chronicle reported that his death was a suicide. As his only surviving child, Margaret was heiress to his considerable fortune and inheritor of his contested claim to the throne. Both effectively rendered Margaret, as her biographers Jones and Underwood write, \"a pawn in the unstable political atmosphere of the Lancastrian court\".Upon her first birthday, the king broke the arrangement with Margaret's father and granted the wardship of her extensive lands to William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, although Margaret herself remained in the custody of her mother. Margaret's mother was pregnant at the time of Somerset's death, but the child did not survive and Margaret remained the sole heir. Although she was her father's only legitimate child, Margaret had two maternal half-brothers and three maternal half-sisters from her mother's first marriage whom she supported after her son's accession to the throne.\nMargaret was married to Suffolk's son, John de la Pole. The wedding may have been held between 28 January and 7 February 1444, when she was perhaps a year old but certainly no more than three. However, there is more evidence to suggest they were married in January 1450, after Suffolk had been arrested and was looking to secure his son's future by betrothing him to a conveniently wealthy ward whose children could be potential claimants to the throne. Papal dispensation was granted on 18 August 1450, necessary because the spouses were closely related (Lady Margaret and de la Pole being the great-grandchildren of two sisters, Katherine Swynford and Philippa Chaucer, respectively), and this concurs with the later date of marriage. Three years later, her marriage to de la Pole was dissolved, and King Henry VI granted Margaret's wardship to his own half-brothers, Jasper and Edmund Tudor.Margaret never recognised the marriage to de la Pole. In her will, made in 1472, Margaret refers to Edmund Tudor as her first husband. Under canon law, Margaret was not bound by her first marriage contract as she was entered into the marriage before reaching the age of twelve.Even before the annulment of her first marriage, Henry VI chose Margaret as a bride for his half-brother, Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond. This was likely to strengthen Edmund's claim to the throne should Henry be forced to designate Edmund his heir; the king was then without child or legitimate siblings. Edmund was the eldest son of the king's mother, Catherine of Valois, by Owen Tudor.At nine years old Margaret was required to assent formally to the marriage. Later she claimed she was divinely guided to do so.At age twelve Margaret married Edmund Tudor, twelve years her senior, on 1 November 1455. The Wars of the Roses had just broken out. Edmund, a Lancastrian, was taken prisoner by Yorkist forces less than a year later. He died of the plague in captivity at Carmarthen on 3 November 1456, leaving a 13-year-old widow who was pregnant with their child.The Countess always respected the name and memory of Edmund as the father of her only child. In 1472, sixteen years after his death, Margaret specified in her will that she wanted to be buried alongside Edmund, even though she had enjoyed a long, stable and close marriage with her third husband, who had died in 1471.", "hasanswer": false}]}

While Luxembourg was occupied by Germans during the Second World War, the grand ducal family was abroad in exile. Jean studied at the Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec City. Jean later volunteered to join the British army's Irish Guards in 1942, and after graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, received his commission in 1943. He participated in the Normandy landings and the Battle for Caen, and joined the Allied forces in the liberation of Luxembourg. From 1984 until 2000, he was Colonel of the Regiment of the Irish Guards.\nOn 9 April 1953, Jean married Princess Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte of Belgium, with whom he had five children.

{"id": "40_823", "question": "Who is Yuan Xie's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_71531", "text": "Emperor Xuanwu, who was 16 at the time of his ascension, initially wanted Yuan Xie to stay as his prime minister, but Yuan Xie repeatedly declined, citing Emperor Xiaowen's agreement for him to leave his posts.  Emperor Xuanwu, instead, made him the governor of Ding Province (\u5b9a\u5dde, modern central Hubei), and initially Yuan Xie declined as well, but Emperor Xuanwu forced him to accept.  In 500, when the Southern Qi general Pei Shuye (\u88f4\u53d4\u696d) surrendered his city Shouyang to northern Wei, Emperor Xuanwu sent Yuan Xie and Wang Su to secure Shouyang and to assist Pei.  They were able to, and Emperor Xuanwu subsequently rebestowed the prime minister title on Yuan Xie, but had him take the post of governor of Yang Province (\u63da\u5dde, modern central Anhui) and defend Shouyang.  Soon, he recalled Yuan Xie to the capital to be prime minister again.\nIn 501, over a power conflict between Yuan Xi and the general Yu Lie (\u4e8e\u70c8), Yu Lie's son Yu Zhong, a close attendant of Emperor Xuanwu warned Emperor Xuanwu that the princes were too powerful, and that he should assume power himself.  Yuan Xiang also reported on Yuan Xi's faults and suggested that Yuan Xie was also too powerful.  In spring 501, Emperor Xuanwu summoned his princely uncles to the palace under heavy guard, and then relieved them (except Yuan Xiang) of their posts, and announced that he was assuming power himself.  From this point on, however, Emperor Xuanwu's government was dominated by his attendants and his maternal uncle Gao Zhao.  In 503, Emperor Xuanwu recalled Yuan Xie to his administration with the honorific title Taishi (\u592a\u5e2b), but the title, while highly honored, carried little power.\nin 504, Yuan Xiang, who was then powerful, was accused by Gao Zhao of corruption, and he was arrested.  He soon died while imprisoned.  As a result of this episode, Gao further suggested to Emperor Xuanwu to put the imperial princes under heavy guard, a suggestion that Yuan Xie objected to but Emperor Xuanwu accepted.  It was said that Yuan Xie was often depressed from this point on.  Late that year, Emperor Xuanwu made Yuan Xie be in charge of supervising a team of officials led by Yuan Fan (\u8881\u7ffb) in revising the empire's laws.  In 506, when the official Zhen Chen (\u7504\u741b) suggested that the state monopoly on salt be ended, Yuan Xie, along with Xing Luan (\u90a2\u5dd2), opposed on account that ending the monopoly would lead to wastefulness and draining of the treasury, but Emperor Xuanwu approved Zhen's proposal anyway.\nAs the years went by, Gao Zhao grew increasingly powerful, particularly more so after his niece Consort Gao became a favorite consort of Emperor Xuanwu.  After Emperor Xuanwu's first wife, Empress Yu died in 507, Emperor Xuanwu wanted to make Consort Gao empress.  Yuan Xie opposed, but Emperor Xuanwu created her empress in 508 anyway.  Gao Zhao thereafter despised Yuan Xie.  When Emperor Xuanwu's brother Yuan Yu (\u5143\u6109) the Prince of Jingzhao rebelled in fall 508, Yuan Yu seized Yuan Xie's maternal uncle Pan Senggu (\u6f58\u50e7\u56fa) and forced Pan to join his rebellion, and Gao Zhao used this incident to falsely accuse Yuan Xie of conspiring with Yuan Yu and rival Liang Dynasty (which had replaced Southern Qi).  Yuan Xie's attendants Wei Yan (\u9b4f\u5043) and Gao Zuzhen (\u9ad8\u7956\u73cd), wanting to please Gao Zhao, testified against Yuan Xie, and Emperor Xuanwu believed him.  Later that year, Emperor Xuanwu held a feast and invited the princes and Gao Zhao to attend\u2014requiring Yuan Xie to do so despite the fact that his wife Princess Li was due to give birth.  After the feast, the princes were directed to bedrooms in the palace to spend the night.  That night, Emperor Xuanwu sent the guard commander Yuan Zhen (\u5143\u73cd) to take poisoned wine to Yuan Xie, ordering him to commit suicide.  Yuan Xie initially refused, wanting to make one last appeal to Emperor Xuanwu, but Yuan Zhen's soldiers battered his ribs until he complied.  Once he drank the wine, the soldiers killed him even before the poison could take effect.  His body was wrapped in blankets and returned to his mansion, under the pretense that he had died from alcohol poisoning, although quickly the populace came to believe that Gao Zhao had killed him.  Emperor Xuanwu outwardly mourned Yuan Xie and posthumously honored him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She had two sons with him before he married her in 1339. This marriage engendered much protest from the Patriarch of Constantinople, John XIV Kalekas. Their marriage only lasted about nine months before he died after a short illness; Miller writes again, \"It was whispered that the discarded Empress had murdered him privily, and her conduct lent some colour to the suspicion, for she was evidently prepared to profit by his demise.\" Irene Palaiologina, the so-called \"discarded Empress\", and her supporters seized power immediately and sent Irene of Trebizond with her two young sons, Alexios and John, off to Constantinople to the safe-keeping of Palaiologina's father, Andronikos III Palaiologos. While Irene and children were in exile Trebizond witnessed palace revolutions, both in Trebizond (Trapezuntine Civil War) and in Constantinople (Byzantine civil war). The Byzantine regency government of John V Palaiologos supported her late husband's uncle Michael of Trebizond and also Basil's cousin John III of Trebizond in their power bids for power in Trebizond, but when John VI Kantakouzenos won the Byzantine civil war, he lent his support to a power bid on the behalf of Irene's son John. Her other son Alexios is not mentioned after his departure from Trebizond and may have died soon after arriving in Constantinople. This bid for the throne was supported by Niketas Scholares, the leader of the powerful Scholares clan whom Michael had alienated. The bid was successful and overturned the weak and violent government of Michael and brought Irene's son to the throne, who took the name Alexios.Alexios' accession at the age of 13 also marked the beginning of Irene's own power in the government of Trebizond. She presumably struggled for power with the nobles and especially with the Doranites family, who led an unsuccessful revolt in the capital when Alexios had not been on the throne six months. Although that rebellion was quashed, her son Alexios retired to the castle fortress of Tripolis for security. In 1341 she accompanied an expedition to Limnia with Michael Panaretos and seized the city from the rebel Constantine Doranites. She accompanied a second campaign led by her son in January 1352 against the cup-bearer John Tzanichites, who had seized by force his ancestral castle of Tzanicha.After this point, Irene's presence in the historical record becomes more intermittent. In 1367 she accompanied her son Alexios when her granddaughter Anna was married to the king of Georgia. She also was present at the baptism of her great-grandson Basil, renamed later Alexios IV of Trebizond in 1382, which is the last time she is mentioned in recorded history.

However he was not the first to make such lenses. Optician George Bass, following the instructions of Chester Moore Hall, made and sold such lenses as early as 1733. In the late 1750s, Bass told Dollond about Hall's design; Dollond saw the potential and was able to reproduce them.Dollond appears to have known of the prior work and refrained from enforcing his patent.  After his death, his son, Peter, did take action to enforce the patent.  A number of his competitors, including Bass, Benjamin Martin, Robert Rew and Jesse Ramsden, took action. Dollond's patent was upheld, as the court found that the patent was valid due to Dollond's exploitation of the invention while prior inventors did not.

Nansen's daughter Liv recorded that there were no speeches, just music: Schubert's Death and the Maiden, which Eva used to sing.In his lifetime and thereafter, Nansen received honours and recognition from many countries. Among the many tributes paid to him subsequently was that of Lord Robert Cecil, a fellow League of Nations delegate, who spoke of the range of Nansen's work, done with no regard for his own interests or health: \"Every good cause had his support. He was a fearless peacemaker, a friend of justice, an advocate always for the weak and suffering.\"Nansen was a pioneer and innovator in many fields. As a young man he embraced the revolution in skiing methods that transformed it from a means of winter travel to a universal sport, and quickly became one of Norway's leading skiers. He was later able to apply this expertise to the problems of polar travel, in both his Greenland and his Fram expeditions.\nHe invented the \"Nansen sledge\" with broad, ski-like runners, the \"Nansen cooker\" to improve the heat efficiency of the standard spirit stoves then in use, and the layer principle in polar clothing, whereby the traditionally heavy, awkward garments were replaced by layers of lightweight material. In science, Nansen is recognised both as one of the founders of modern neurology, and as a significant contributor to early oceanographical science, in particular for his work in establishing the Central Oceanographic Laboratory in Christiania.Through his work on behalf of the League of Nations, Nansen helped to establish the principle of international responsibility for refugees. Immediately after his death the League set up the Nansen International Office for Refugees, a semi-autonomous body under the League's authority, to continue his work. The Nansen Office faced great difficulties, in part arising from the large numbers of refugees from the European dictatorships during the 1930s. Nevertheless, it secured the agreement of 14 countries (including a reluctant Great Britain) to the Refugee Convention of 1933.\nIt also helped to repatriate 10,000 Armenians to Yerevan in Soviet Armenia, and to find homes for a further 40,000 in Syria and Lebanon. In 1938, the year in which it was superseded by a wider-ranging body, the Nansen Office was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1954, the League's successor body, the United Nations, established the Nansen Medal, later named the Nansen Refugee Award, given annually by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to an individual, group or organisation \"for outstanding work on behalf of the forcibly displaced\".Numerous geographical features bear his name: the Nansen Basin and the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean; Mount Nansen in the Yukon region of Canada; Mount Nansen, Mount Fridtjof Nansen and Nansen Island, all in Antarctica; as well as Nansen Island in the Kara Sea, Nansen Land in Greenland and Nansen Island in Franz Josef Land; 853 Nansenia, an asteroid; Nansen crater at the Moon's north pole and Nansen crater on Mars.

He and Zhu Ling later led a separate force to pacify the Di tribes in Yumi (\u9683\u7cdc) and Qian (\u6c67) counties. Following that, he rendezvoused with Cao Cao's main force in Anding Commandery (\u5b89\u5b9a\u90e1; covering parts of present-day Ningxia and Gansu), where they forced Yang Qiu, an ally of Han Sui and Ma Chao, to surrender.In 212, Cao Cao returned to Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei), leaving behind Xiahou Yuan, Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao (\u8def\u62db) to garrison in Chang'an. Xiahou Yuan held the appointment of acting General Who Protects the Army (\u8b77\u8ecd\u5c07\u8ecd) at the time. He defeated a group of bandits led by Liu Xiong (\u5289\u96c4) in Nanshan (\u5357\u5c71) and forced them to surrender. He also besieged Liang Xing (\u6881\u8208; an ally of Han Sui and Ma Chao) in Hu County (\u9120\u7e23) and defeated and killed Liang Xing. In recognition of his contributions, the Han imperial court enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Bochang Village (\u535a\u660c\u4ead\u4faf).In 213, Ma Chao besieged Wei Kang, the Inspector (\u523a\u53f2) of Liang Province, in the provincial capital Ji (\u517e; or Jicheng, in present-day Gangu County, Gansu). Xiahou Yuan wanted to lead reinforcements to help Wei Kang but arrived too late as Ji had already fallen to Ma Chao while Xiahou Yuan and his army were still more than 200 li away from Ji. Ma Chao led an army out to face Xiahou Yuan. Xiahou Yuan would be unsuccessful against Ma Chao and he decided to withdraw his troops when he heard that the Di tribes in Qian County (\u6c67\u7e23) had started a rebellion.In 214, Zhao Qu (\u8d99\u8862), Yin Feng (\u5c39\u5949) and several others, who were forced to submit to Ma Chao after he seized control of Liang Province, secretly plotted to drive Ma Chao out of the province. Jiang Xu started a revolt in Lu (\u9e75; or Lucheng, in present-day Li County, Gansu) to lure Ma Chao to attack him, while Zhao Qu and the others pretended to urge Ma Chao to lead his troops to Lu to suppress the revolt. Ma Chao fell for the ruse. Soon after he left Ji, Zhao Qu and the others turned against him and killed his wife and child(ren). At the same time, Ma Chao also failed to recapture Lu from Jiang Xu, so he became stranded.\nMa Chao retreated to Hanzhong Commandery, where he borrowed troops from the warlord Zhang Lu and returned to attack Jiang Xu and his allies at Mount Qi (\u7941\u5c71; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu). Jiang Xu sent a messenger to Chang'an to request for reinforcements. Xiahou Yuan and the officers in Chang'an held a meeting on whether to help Jiang Xu and his allies or not. Many of the officers thought that they should wait for orders from Cao Cao before making any move. However, Xiahou Yuan had a different opinion and he said, \"Our lord is 4,000 li away in Ye. By the time he receives our report, Jiang Xu and his allies are done for. Therefore, it is imperative that we send reinforcements to them immediately.\" He appointed Zhang He to lead 5,000 infantry and cavalry as the vanguard and head towards Mount Qi via a narrow pass at Chencang (\u9673\u5009; present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi), while he supervised the supply train and followed behind with another army. When Zhang He's 5,000 strong army reached the Wei River, Ma Chao initially sent a few thousand Di and Qiang horsemen to resist the enemy, but later called for a retreat before both sides could engage in battle. Zhang He advanced further and seized the military equipment left behind by Ma Chao's forces. When Xiahou Yuan's army arrived, most of the counties in Liang Province had been pacified.After the victory, Xiahou Yuan prepared for an offensive against Ma Chao's ally Han Sui, who retreated when he heard of Xiahou Yuan's approach. Xiahou Yuan captured Han Sui's food supplies and pursued him to Lueyang County. Han Sui had set up a base some 20 li away from Xiahou Yuan's position, so Xiahou Yuan's subordinates urged their general to attack either Han Sui or the Di tribes in Xingguo (\u8208\u570b; northeast of present-day Qin'an County, Gansu). Xiahou Yuan chose neither of the two options as he knew that Han Sui's troops were well-prepared for battle and that Xingguo's fortifications were strong. Instead, he planned to attack the Qiang tribes in Changli (\u9577\u96e2; along the Hulu River, Gansu). He pointed out that many of Han Sui's soldiers were Qiang tribesmen from Changli, so they would return to save their home if they heard that Changli was under attack. If Han Sui's troops decided to hold their current position, they would be isolated; if they came to defend Changli, Xiahou Yuan's forces would be able to engage them in battle. Xiahou Yuan then ordered his subordinates to guard their supplies and heavy equipment while he led a unit of lightly armed infantry and cavalry to raid Changli, burning down many Qiang camps and killing many people. As Xiahou Yuan expected, the Qiang tribesmen in Han Sui's army returned to Changli and encountered Xiahou Yuan's army. Xiahou Yuan's men were fearful when they saw Han Sui's larger army, so they proposed setting up camps and defensive structures before fighting the enemy. However, Xiahou Yuan said, \"We've travelled over a long distance. Our troops will be worn out by the time they finish erecting these defensive structures, and won't have energy left to fight the enemy. The enemy may have superiority in numbers but they are easy to deal with.\" He then launched an attack on Han Sui's forces and scored a major victory over the enemy, capturing their flags and banners. After that, he returned to Lueyang County and laid siege on Xingguo. The Di chieftains in Xingguo fled to join Ma Chao while the others surrendered. Xiahou Yuan also attacked some Xiongnu encampments at Gaoping (\u9ad8\u5e73; in present-day Guyuan, Ningxia), drove the Xiongnu away, and captured their supplies and livestock. The Han imperial court authorised him to oversee the affairs in the region.During the Liang Province Rebellion in the 180s, a rebel chief Song Jian (\u5b8b\u5efa) declared himself \"King of the River Source Who Pacifies Han\" (\u6cb3\u9996\u5e73\u6f22\u738b) in Fuhan County (\u67b9\u7f55\u7e23; around present-day Linxia, Gansu). After Xiahou Yuan pacified Liang Province, Cao Cao ordered him to attack Song Jian. Xiahou Yuan besieged Fuhan, conquered the county within months, and captured and executed Song Jian and all his followers. He also sent Zhang He to force the other Qiang tribes in the region to surrender. By 215, most of western China had been pacified and submitted to Cao Cao's control. Cao Cao wrote an order to praise Xiahou Yuan: \"Song Jian had been causing trouble for over 30 years. Xiahou Yuan eliminated him in one movement and made an unprecedented achievement.

Soon after he assumed control of Lesbos, he informed Genoa that he wished to be part of their 1428 treaty with Alfonso V of Aragon. This led to his participation in the Genoese war with Venice over the next few years.Around 1438, apparently through the efforts of the Byzantine Empress Maria, Dorino's daughter Maria was married to Alexander of Trebizond, the exiled despotes of Trebziond, thus pulling Dornio into the politics of that Pontic state.

Genoese archives contain a copy of a letter written on 10 March 1438 to Dorino Gattilusio, in which they urge him to do what he could to bring peace between Alexander and his brother, and containing an offer of a pension to Alexander if he dropped his plans which would allow him to live where ever he wanted to, Mytilene, or Constantinople.

In 1953, aged 18, he joined the army where he played clarinet in the Military band and saxophone with the unit Dance Band.  After demob in 1955 he spent some time in France with the Micky Bryan Band (Micky on piano, Gerry Salisbury (valve trombone), Harry Bryan (trumpet), Lennie Hastings on drums, and Coe on clarinet), before rejoining Joe Daniels.   In 1957 Tony's father went to see Humphrey Lyttelton and, as a result, Tony spent just over four years with Humphrey's band from 1957 to the end of 1961.  This was a period when Coe was brought to the attention of critics and fans as well as giving him some degree of international fame.  \nHe left Lyttleton at the end of 1961 to form his own outfit. As leader, his notable albums in this period include 1967's Tony's Basement for Denis Preston, a combination of jazz players and string quartet which \"suits his evenness of tone and highly personal sound perfectly, and which recalls Stan Getz's beautiful Focus\".In 1965, Coe was invited to join Count Basie's band (later saying: \"I'm glad it didn't come off \u2013 I would have lasted about a fortnight\") and has since played with the John Dankworth Orchestra, the Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band, Derek Bailey's free improvisation group Company, Stan Tracey, Michael Gibbs, Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, and Bob Brookmeyer, and performed under Pierre Boulez as well as leading a series of groups of his own, including Coe Oxley & Co with drummer Tony Oxley. Another recording with Denis Preston is his \"Third Stream masterpiece\" Zeitgeist from 1977.

{"id": "40_861", "question": "Who is Penelope's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_71674", "text": "Penelope is married to the main character, the king of Ithaca, Odysseus (Ulysses in Roman mythology), and daughter of Icarius of Sparta and Periboea (or Polycaste). She only has one son with Odysseus, Telemachus, who was born just before Odysseus was called to fight in the Trojan War. She waits twenty years for Odysseus' return, during which time she devises various cunning strategies to delay marrying any of the 108 suitors (led by Antinous and including Agelaus, Amphinomus, Ctessippus, Demoptolemus, Elatus, Euryades, Eurymachus and Peisandros).\nOn Odysseus's return, disguised as an old beggar, he finds that Penelope has remained faithful. She has devised cunning tricks to delay the suitors, one of which is to pretend to be weaving a burial shroud for Odysseus's elderly father Laertes and claiming that she will choose a suitor when she has finished. Every night for three years, she undoes part of the shroud, until Melantho, a slave, discovers her chicanery and reveals it to the suitors.\nPenelope's efforts to delay remarriage is often seen as a symbol of marital fidelity to her husband, Odysseus. But because Athena wants her \"to show herself to the wooers, that she might set their hearts a-flutter and win greater honor from her husband and her son than heretofore\", Penelope does eventually appear before the suitors (xviii\u202f160\u2212162) Irene de Jong wrote\n\n\u202fAs so often, it is Athena who takes the initiative in giving the story a new direction ... Usually the motives of mortal and god coincide, here they do not: Athena wants Penelope to fan the Suitors\u2019 desire for her and (thereby) make her more esteemed by her husband and son; Penelope has no real motive ... she simply feels an unprecedented impulse to meet the men she so loathes ... adding that she might take this opportunity to talk to Telemachus (which she will indeed do).\nIt is important to consider the alternate perspective of Penelope entertaining, and even enjoying the attention of, her suitors. Italian philosophy historian Giula Sissa offers a unique perspective which supports this idea. The Odyssey allows room for Penelope\u2019s identity free of being Ulysses\u2019 wife. As she awaits his return, she makes a plan to deal with her suitors while also responding to her desires. Sissa discusses how Penelope gives her suitors the opportunity to demonstrate themselves as the best candidate for her attention. Sissa writes,\n\n\"Penelope innovates. And she does so because she responds in the same register to the desires of the men who have been awaiting her verdict for three years. This is an erotic desire to which she reacts, first, with seductive wiles of messages and promises, and then by inviting them to demonstrate their excellence, not in terms of wealth and social prestige, but in terms of something extremely personal and physical. In order to please Penelope, they have to be on par with Ulysses in showing the might of their bodies.\"\nShe is ambivalent, variously asking Artemis to kill her and apparently considering marrying one of the suitors. When the disguised Odysseus returns, she announces in her long interview with him that whoever can string Odysseus's rigid bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads may have her hand. \"For the plot of the Odyssey, of course, her decision is the turning point, the move that makes possible the long-predicted triumph of the returning hero\".There is debate as to whether Penelope knows that it is Odysseus. Penelope and the suitors know that Odysseus (were he in fact present) would easily surpass them all in any test of masculine skill, so she may have started the contest as an opportunity for him to reveal his identity. On the other hand, because Odysseus seems to be the only person (except, perhaps, Telemachus) who can actually use the bow, she could just be further delaying her marriage to one of the suitors.\nWhen the contest of the bow begins, none of the suitors are able to string the bow, except Odysseus who wins the contest. Having done so, he proceeds to slaughter the suitors \u2013 beginning with Antinous whom he finds drinking from his cup \u2013 with help from Telemachus, Athena and the slaves Eumaeus the swineherd and Philoetius the cowherd. Odysseus has now revealed himself in all his glory (with a little makeover by Athena); yet Penelope cannot believe that her husband has really returned \u2013 she fears that it is perhaps some god in disguise, as in the story of Alcmene \u2013 and tests him by ordering her slave Eurycleia to move the bed in their bridal-chamber. Odysseus protests that this cannot be done, since he made the bed himself and knows that one of its legs is a living olive tree. Penelope finally accepts that he truly is Odysseus, a moment that highlights their homophros\u00fdn\u0113 (\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7, \"like-mindedness\"). Homer implies that from then on Odysseus would live a long and happy life together with Penelope and Telemachus, wisely ruling his kingdom, and enjoying wide respect and much success.In some early sources such as Pindar, Pan's parents are Apollo and Penelope. Herodotus, Cicero, Apollodorus, and Hyginus all describe Hermes and Penelope as his parents. Pausanias records the story that Penelope had in fact been unfaithful to Odysseus, who banished her to Mantineia upon his return. In the 5th century AD Nonnus names Pan's mother as Penelope of Mantineia in Arcadia. Other sources report that Penelope had slept with all 108 suitors in Odysseus' absence, and gave birth to Pan as a result. This myth reflects the folk etymology that equates Pan's name (\u03a0\u03ac\u03bd) with the Greek word for \"all\" (\u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd). The Odyssey carefully suppresses this variant tradition.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "40_862", "question": "Who is Parysatis's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_71191", "text": "Arses was the eldest son of Darius II, who ruled the Persian Achaemenid Empire from 424 to 405/4 BC. His mother was Parysatis, a half-sister of Darius II. His age at death is variously given as 86 (Lucian) and 94 (Dinon) years, which would place his birth around 453 or 445 BC. Briant simply notes that Arses was born before his father's accession in 424, while another author states that he was \"at least in his late seventies in the early 360s\". Darius II and Parysatis had thirteen children, most of whom died prematurely. Thus the only known full siblings of Arsaces were his younger brothers Cyrus, Ostanes, Oxathres, and an older sister, Amestris.With the exception of Arsaces and Cyrus, not much is known about the children of Darius II and Parysatis. Cyrus was most likely born in 424/423 BC, just after the accession of Darius II. In 408 BC, at the age of 15 or 16, Cyrus was appointed the satrap of Lydia, Greater Phrygia, and Cappadocia. He also succeeded Tissaphernes as the commander-in-chief of the Persian force stationed at Castolus, east of the city of Sardis. Cyrus was given the title of karanos (Old Iranian: *Karana), which greatly expanded his authority both politically and militarily, and allowed him to become largely autonomous.Before his accession, Arsaces married Stateira, the daughter of the Persian nobleman Hydarnes, who was descended from Hydarnes, one of the seven Persian conspirators who overthrew the Pseudo-Smerdis. The marriage was part of a political alliance that Darius had sought during his early reign, due to facing opposition against his rule. Amestris was also married to Hydarnes' son Teritoukhmes, while Hydarnes was appointed the satrap of Hyrcania.When Darius II was on his deathbed, Arsaces was by his side. According to Xenophon, Darius II summoned Cyrus, who arrived with Tissaphernes and 300 Greek hoplites. Plutarch, however, reports that it was Parysatis who summoned Cyrus, as she favoured him over Arsaces. He further adds that she attempted to convince Darius II to choose Cyrus as his heir, as the position was still vacant. Modern historians question Plutarch's account, and state that Arsaces must have already been chosen as heir previously, probably several years earlier.During the coronation of Arsaces at the southern capital of Pasargadae, Cyrus allegedly attempted to have his brother assassinated. The plan was exposed by Tissaphernes, but Cyrus was spared following the intervention of Parysatis and sent back to Asia Minor. The authenticity of this event is deemed uncertain by modern historians. According to Binder, the transition of power between Darius II and Arsaces was seemingly peaceful. During his investiture, Arsaces adopted the throne name of Artaxerxes.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His mother was an American from Washington, D.C. with Breton French and Ukrainian Jewish ancestry, while his father was an Italian immigrant from Gioia del Colle who moved to the U.S. in the 1930s. His younger brother is actor and musician Frank Stallone. Many biographies of Stallone indicate that his birth name is \"Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone\" and his mother explained in an interview that she originally named him \"Tyrone\" because she admired the actor Tyrone Power, but Stallone's father changed it to \"Sylvester\". His nickname as a child was \"Binky\" but he chose to go by the nickname of Mike/Michael after schoolmates began calling him \"Stinky\". His middle name \"Gardenzio\" is an alteration of the Italian given name \"Gaudenzio\" and he usually shortened it to \"Enzio\".Complications during Stallone's birth forced his mother's obstetricians to use two pairs of forceps while delivering him, accidentally severing a nerve in the process. This caused paralysis of the lower left side of his face (including parts of his lip, tongue, and chin) which gave him his signature snarling look and slurred speech.

He was persuaded that Anne's writing shed light on the experiences of those who suffered persecution under the Nazis and was urged to consider publishing it.

In 1963, he founded the Anne Frank Foundation in Basel (not to be confused with the Anne Frank Foundation in Amsterdam, see below), which is devoted to global distribution and use of the Diary of Anne Frank. The non-profit organisation uses the proceeds of the copyrights for charitable purposes, education, and scientific research. In addition the Foundation  in Basel supports projects in the field of human rights, racism and rights and promoting social justice.In response to a demolition order placed on the building in which Otto Frank and his family hid during the war, he and Johannes Kleiman helped establish the Anne Frank Foundation in Amsterdam on May 3, 1957, with the principal aim to save and restore the building so it could be opened to the general public. With the aid of public donations, the building and the adjacent one were purchased by the Amsterdam-based foundation. It opened as a museum (the Anne Frank House) on 3 May 1960 and is still in operation.The rest of his life, Otto Frank dedicated himself to the publication of the diary and the ideals his daughter had expressed in it. Otto Frank died of lung cancer on 19 August 1980 in Birsfelden and his ashes were buried in the town's cemetery, where Elfriede would also be buried, in the same tomb, 18 years later. He was survived by his stepdaughter Eva Schloss, his sister Helene Frank (Edith Frank's sister-in-law) and her two children.Otto Frank designated the Anne Frank Foundation in Basel as his sole heir and legal successor, which means that the copyright on all Anne Frank's writings belongs to this organisation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Through her mother\u2019s previous marriages, she had various maternal half-brothers and sisters and two full blooded brothers who served as Seleucid kings Antiochus V Eupator and Alexander Balas.  In 152 BC, Laodice became one of the supporters for her brother Alexander Balas, who revolted and overthrew the Seleucid king Demetrius I Soter, who was their maternal half-brother/cousin.\nThe other alternative is Laodice appears to have come from obscure origins, connected with the same impostorship as Alexander Balas. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates V. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain. The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice VI.\nAfter 152 BC, Laodice married King Mithridates V of Pontus, who reigned from 150\u2013120 BC. Mithridates V and Laodice VI were related, as her husband had lineage from the Seleucid dynasty. Little is known regarding her relationship with her husband or her reign as Pontian queen. During their marriage, Laodice bore Mithridates V seven children: Laodice (I) (by marriage Queen consort of Cappadocia), Mithridates VI of Pontus, Mithridates Chrestus, Laodice (II) (by marriage Queen consort of Pontus), Nysa (sometimes spelt as Nyssa), Roxana and Statira.

During her regency 120\u2013116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC), Mithridates VI escaped from the plotting of his mother and had gone into hiding. She enjoyed luxuries that made her a compliant client of Rome. She accepted bribes from the Roman Republic and her extravagance pushed Pontus into debt.Mithridates VI between 116\u2013113 BC returned to Pontus from hiding and was hailed king. He was able to remove his mother and his brother from the Pontian throne, thus Mithridates VI became the sole ruler of Pontus. Mithridates VI show clemency towards his mother and brother, by imprisoning them both.

The nearby Holy Roman Empire was torn by civil war due to having two rivals contesting for its throne, Otto IV, House of Guelf, and King Philip, House of Hohenstaufen. Valdemar II allied himself with Otto IV against Phillip.\nIn 1203 Valdemar invaded and conquered Lybeck and Holstein, adding them to the territories controlled by Denmark. In 1204 he attempted to influence the outcome of the Norwegian succession by leading a Danish fleet and army to Viken in Norway in support of Erling Steinvegg, the pretender to the Norwegian throne. This resulted in the second Bagler War which lasted until 1208. The question of the Norwegian succession was temporarily settled and the Norwegian king owed allegiance to the king of Denmark.\n\nIn 1207, a majority of Bremian capitulars again elected Bishop Valdemar as prince-archbishop, while a minority, led by the capitular provost Burkhard, Count of Stumpenhausen fled for Hamburg, being the seat of a Bremian subchapter with regional competence and delegating for episcopal elections two participants to the main Bremian chapter. The German King Philip recognised Valdemar as the legitimate prince-archbishop of Bremen, because thus the prince-archbishopric would become his ally against Valdemar II.\nValdemar II and the fled capitulars protested to Pope Innocent III, who first wanted to research the case. When Bishop Valdemar left Rome for Bremen against Pope Innocent's order to wait his decision, he banished Valdemar by an anathema and in 1208 finally dismissed him as Bishop of Schleswig. In 1208, Burkhard, Count of Stumpenhausen, was elected by the fled capitulars in Hamburg as rival prince-archbishop and Valdemar II, usurping imperial power, invested Burkhard with the regalia \u2013 with effect only in the prince-archiepiscopal and diocesan territory north of the Elbe. In 1209 Innocent III finally consented the consecration of Bishop Nicholas I of Schleswig, a close confidant and consultant of King Valdemar, as successor of the deposed Bishop Valdemar. In 1214 King Valdemar appointed Bishop Nicholas I as Chancellor of Denmark, succeeding the late Peder Sunesen, Bishop of Roskilde.\nIn the same year Valdemar II invaded with Danish troops the prince-archiepiscopal territory south of the Elbe and conquered Stade. In August Prince-Archbishop Valdemar reconquered the city only to lose it soon after again to Valdemar II, who now built a bridge of the Elbe and fortified a forward post in Harburg upon Elbe. In 1209 Otto IV persuaded Valdemar II to withdraw into the north of the Elbe, urged Burkhard to resign and expelled Prince-Archbishop Valdemar.\nIn 1210, Innocent III made Gerhard I, Count of Oldenburg-Wildeshausen Bremen's new Prince-Archbishop. In 1211 Duke Bernard III of the younger Duchy of Saxony escorted his brother-in-law Valdemar, the papally dismissed Prince-Archbishop, into the city of Bremen, de facto regaining the See and enjoying the sudden support of Otto IV, who meanwhile fell out with Innocent over Sicily. As a reaction Valdemar II recaptured Stade, while in 1213 Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine, conquered it for Prince-Archbishop Valdemar.\nIn 1213 Valdemar instituted a war tax in Norway, and the peasants murdered Valdemar's tax collector at the Tr\u00f8ndelag Assembly and revolted.

One of the most famous temples of Asclepius was at Epidaurus in north-eastern Peloponnese, dated to the fourth century BC. Another famous asclepeion was built approximately a century later on the island of Kos, where Hippocrates, the legendary \"father of medicine\", may have begun his career. Other asclepieia were situated in Gortys (in Arcadia), and Pergamum in Asia.\n\nFrom the fifth century BC onwards, the cult of Asclepius grew very popular and pilgrims flocked to his healing temples (Asclepieia) to be cured of their ills. Ritual purification would be followed by offerings or sacrifices to the god (according to means), and the supplicant would then spend the night in the holiest part of the sanctuary\u2013 the abaton (or adyton). Any dreams or visions would be reported to a priest who would prescribe the appropriate therapy by a process of interpretation. Some healing temples also used sacred dogs to lick the wounds of sick petitioners. In honor of Asclepius, a particular type of non-venomous snake was often used in healing rituals, and these snakes\u2014 the Aesculapian Snakes\u2014 slithered around freely on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept.

{"id": "40_921", "question": "Who is Eanred's child?", "ctxs": [{"id": "40_71909", "text": "Eanred was king of Northumbria in the early ninth century.\nVery little is known for certain about Eanred. The only reference made by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to the Northumbrians in this period is the statement that in 829 Egbert of Wessex \"led an army against the Northumbrians as far as Dore, where they met him, and offered terms of obedience and subjection, on the acceptance of which they returned home\", thereby, at least temporarily, extending Egbert's hegemony to the entirety of Anglo-Saxon Britain.\nRoger of Wendover states that Eanred reigned from 810 until 840, the twelfth-century History of the Church of Durham records a reign of 33 years, and a recently discovered coin of Eanred has been dated to c. 850 on stylistic grounds. Given the turbulence of Northumbrian history in this period, a reign of this length suggests a figure of some significance. Within a generation of Eanred's death, Anglian monarchy in Northumbria had collapsed.\n\nEanred was the son of King Eardwulf, who was deposed by an otherwise unknown \u00c6lfwald in 806. According to the History of the Church of Durham, \u00c6lfwald ruled for two years before Eanred succeeded. However, Frankish sources claim that, after being expelled from England, Eardwulf was received by Charlemagne and then the pope, and that their envoys escorted him back to Northumbria and secured his restoration to power. Therefore the precise nature of the succession of Eanred is unclear. All sources agree that Eanred was eventually succeeded by his son, \u00c6thelred.\n\nEanred's reign sees the appearance of the styca, a new style of small coin which replaced the earlier sceat. These stycas were of low silver content, later coins being effectively brass. Produced in York, large numbers have survived and several moneyers are named on the surviving coins, suggesting that they were minted in significant quantities. Higham estimates that hundreds of thousands of stycas were in circulation. The distribution of the coin finds suggests that their principal use was in external trade and that, apart from for the payment of taxes, coins were little used by the great majority of Northumbrians in daily life.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The year before his father ascended the throne, Paul joined the Royal Hellenic Navy at eleven years old, becoming the youngest cadet at the time, and after a National Schism during World War I, Constantine's abdication was forced and Paul and his family went into exile in Switzerland. Paul's brother, Alexander, became the Greek sovereign in 1917 and his death in 1920 led to Constantine's restoration. In 1922, Paul's other brother, George, became the monarch. However, the 1924 Greek republic referendum two years later saw the abolition of the Greek monarchy. Paul moved to Italy with his family and then to London.\nIn London, Paul had an affair with his first cousin and his first love, Princess Nina Georgievna of Russia, who would eventually reject his marriage proposal. The monarchy and George's position as king were restored after the 1935 Greek monarchy referendum. George was childless, which made Paul the heir presumptive and gave him the responsibility of finding a spouse and having children. At the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, Paul successfully proposed to Frederica of Hanover, who he had been seeing regularly for the past year. However, Paul's engagement to a German princess received a mixed reaction in Greece, especially since Adolf Hitler attempted to include Nazi swastika flags at their wedding ceremony. Paul fought in World War II and was forced out of Greece with his family when Greece fell to the Axis Powers. Paul moved to Egypt and then South Africa, where he left his wife and three young children and moved to London with his brother for the remainder of the war.\nAfter World War II's conclusion and when George died in 1947, Paul became the King of Greece. Paul soon contracted typhoid fever, which restricted his ability to manage the Greek Civil War. The war nonetheless concluded with monarchists defeating communist forces in the country. During his reign, Paul was also increasingly faced with deterioration in Greco-British relations and Greco-Turkish relations as he worked to achieve enosis. For his support of the movement, Paul was labelled a terrorist in the British media. Though Paul successfully secured money from the Marshall Plan to fund recovery and infrastructure projects, he was criticised for limiting democracy when the new 1952 Greek constitution gave extensive powers to the monarch. During his reign, Paul was commended for his numerous state visits to multiple countries. He was later diagnosed with stomach cancer and died in 1964. He was succeeded by his only son, who became Constantine II. Paul had three children: Queen Sof\u00eda of Spain, Constantine II of Greece and Princess Irene.

He was appointed bishop of Cahors in March 1679 but served only briefly before Pope Innocent XI ordered him transferred in 1680 to head the diocese of Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne, which made him a peer of France.  On 19 August 1695, in recognition of Noailles's family connections, King Louis XIV made him archbishop of Paris and Duke of Saint-Cloud, and in 1700 Pope Innocent XII made him a cardinal.According to Antoine Degert, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia, although Noailles was not brilliant, \"he was possessed of piety, zeal, and activity.\" He is noted for having raised money to feed famine victims by selling his silver tableware in 1709, and for having spent a considerable part of his inheritance on redecorating Notre Dame.\nNoailles was a friend of Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon, with whom he had studied at the Coll\u00e8ge du Plessis before entering the Sorbonne.

His position on Pope Clement XI's 1713 bull Unigenitus was also controversial; he opposed it, despite papal disapproval, up to 1728 but then abruptly reversed himself shortly before his death.\nHe was succeeded as archbishop of Paris and Duke of Saint-Cloud by Charles-Gaspard-Guillaume de Vintimille du Luc.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A special two-hour film, Rumpole's Return, was made and aired in 1980, between the 2nd and 3rd series. The author, John Mortimer, occasionally appeared as an extra.\n\nRumpole and his family:\n\nHorace W. Rumpole: Self-described \"Old Bailey hack\" who defends any and all clients, and never pleads guilty. His strong preference is for criminal cases, but Rumpole has occasionally taken on family law and libel cases. He usually defends clients dependent on legal aid, but sometimes represents paying clients, which he calls \"money briefs\". He loves quoting poetry, especially works by William Wordsworth and other poems from The Oxford Book of English Verse.\nHilda Rumpole (Joyce Heron) (Original Play for Today \"Pilot\"); (Peggy Thorpe-Bates) (Series 1\u20133 and Special); (Marion Mathie) (Series 4\u20137): Privately referred to by Rumpole as \"She Who Must Be Obeyed\" \u2013 a reference to the Rider Haggard novel She. She would dearly love to see Rumpole become a QC, Head of Chambers or a judge \u2013 none of which is a role to which Rumpole aspires. She is the daughter of Rumpole's late head of chambers, C. H. Wystan.\nNicholas Rumpole (David Yelland) (Play for Today, plus Series 1\u20132); (Ian Gelder) (Special only): \"The brains of the family\", as Rumpole calls him. Nick and his father are especially close. Nick studied PPE at Oxford and then sociology at Princeton. Married to an American, he eventually moves to the United States (first Baltimore, then Miami) to work as a professor of sociology.Members of Rumpole's Chambers at 3 Equity Court, London:\n\nSir Guthrie Featherstone QC (Peter Bowles) (Series 1\u20132, Special, and as an occasional guest star in series 3\u20137). The well-connected if occasionally feckless Head of Chambers, he \"took silk\" (becoming a Queen's Counsel) and was elected to Parliament as a Social Democratic Party member early in the series. Rumpole often mock-reverently calls him \"our learned Head of Chambers, Guthrie Featherstone QC, MP\". He is an alumnus of Marlborough College. He becomes a High Court judge after the third series and is embroiled in a number of controversies after being promoted to the bench. Although often in some way in opposition to Rumpole, the two get on far better than do Rumpole and Ballard; Featherstone lacks Ballard's piousness, to which Rumpole takes great exception.\nSamuel Ballard QC (Peter Blythe) (Series 3\u20137): Head of Chambers in later series; a very pious and priggish person, and like his predecessor, a Marlborough alumnus. Rumpole refers to him as \"Soapy Sam\" which is an allusion to a much parodied nineteenth-century Bishop of Oxford, and generally addresses him as \"Bollard\". Later became a judge in the ecclesiastical courts, while maintaining his role as Head of Chambers.\nPhyllida (n\u00e9e Trant) Erskine-Brown QC (Patricia Hodge) (Series 1\u20132, Special, and as an occasional guest star in series 3\u20137). First appeared in episode four in the first series as Erskine-Brown's (and later Rumpole's) pupil, Phyllida Trant. The \"Portia of our Chambers\", Phyllida is a strong advocate with definite opinions of her own. Usually, but not always, sides with Rumpole in Chambers matters. She eventually becomes a Q.C., then a Recorder, and then a High Court judge. She is shown to occasionally flirt with extramarital relationships, but considers Claude's positive points and remains in her marriage.\nClaude Leonard Erskine-Brown QC (Julian Curry): Phyllida's husband, \"opera buff and hopeless cross-examiner\", and sometime would-be philanderer. Although not lacking in personal ambition, he acknowledges his wife's drive and is more than willing to do the lion's share of looking after their children, stating that he'd be happy to move to a more paperwork-based role; he is eventually promoted to Assistant Recorder, and later Q.C., through Phyllida's manoeuvrings. Upon hearing of his promotion, Judge Graves remarked, \"They must be handing out silk gowns with pounds of tea nowadays!\" He particularly loves the operas of Wagner, and his and Phyllida's children are named Tristan and Isolde. He frowns upon Rumpole's clientele, having a largely civil practice, with only an occasional criminal prosecution. Despite this attitude, Rumpole helps Erskine-Brown out in important personal matters without Erskine-Brown's knowledge, and is displeased when he makes the acquaintance of one of Erskine-Brown's schoolmates, who mentions that since Erskine-Brown was a 'pill' at school he warranted bullying. He attended Bogstead School, Winchester College and New College, Oxford.\nT.C. Rowley, widely known as \"Uncle Tom\" (Richard Murdoch) (Series 1\u20136 and Special). \"The oldest member of Chambers, who has not had a brief as long as any of us can remember.\" Rumpole first joined C. H. Wystan's chambers as Uncle Tom's pupil. He is usually seen happily practising his golf putting in the clerk's room, or offering cheerfully inappropriate comments in Chambers' meetings.\nGeorge Frobisher (Moray Watson) (Series 1\u20132, Special, and as an occasional guest star in Series 3\u20135). A sensible if somewhat stiff barrister and Rumpole's closest friend in Chambers. At around the time he becomes a Circuit Judge, his love interest meets Rumpole, and fears he recognises her from an arson case years ago; she leaves Frobisher, with no way to get in contact. Although Frobisher admits he will find it hard to forgive Rumpole for this loss of happiness, in his next appearance, as a circuit judge presiding over a statutory rape case in which Rumpole is defending, he remains friendly, but refuses to bow to Rumpole's persuasion and jails the defendant; from this point on, Rumpole clearly has a jaundiced view of Frobisher in spite of the latter's friendly overtures, making barbed comments about what he considers Frobisher's draconian legal views in much the same way as he disdains other judges. A former Army officer, Frobisher becomes a Judge Advocate for the British Army in series 4; to Rumpole's dismay, he is pompously absorbed in the military legal way of doing things, and upbraids Rumpole on numerous occasions for not acting appropriately.\nPercy Hoskins (Norman Ettlinger) (Series 1, Episode 1 only); (Denys Graham) (Series 3\u20136): A rather minor character, Hoskins seems chiefly concerned with keeping other lawyers from being admitted to Chambers, lest they take away his work. Often prefaces his arguments with the phrase \"Speaking as a man with daughters...\" Later promoted to a judgeship.\nFiona Allways (Rosalyn Landor) (Series 3 only): Originally Phyllida Erskine-Brown's pupil, Rumpole took a liking to her, mentored her, and got her admitted to Chambers. A daughter of the landed gentry, the character left Chambers to get married and was replaced by Liz Probert.\nLiz Probert (Samantha Bond) (Series 4); (Abigail McKern, Leo McKern's daughter) (Series 5\u20137): An outspoken young feminist barrister in Rumpole's chambers, who describes herself as a \"young radical\" and is referred to by Rumpole as \"Miz Liz\". Her father \"Red Ron\" is a prominent trade union official. Rumpole's wife Hilda once suspected him of having an affair with Liz. Introduced in episode 2 in series 4 and becomes Rumpole's pupil.\nDave Inchcape: (Michael Grandage) (Series 5, Episode 6 only); (Christopher Milburn) (Series 6\u20137): A young lawyer who has a sometimes stormy relationship with \"Miz Liz\". He is later revealed to be the Honourable David Luxton.\nCharles Hearthstoke: (Nicholas Gecks) (Series 4, Episodes 4, 6);(Martin Turner) (Series 5, Episode 4): Called \"Hearthrug\" by Rumpole. Another young lawyer, brought in by Ballard at least in part to streamline the operations of Chambers, a move Rumpole and Henry both opposed for differing reasons. Hearthstoke woos Liz Probert during his stint in Chambers, but is ultimately forced out by Rumpole. After departing, he is later tempted to return by the possibility of a romantic \"adventure\" with Phyllida. Rumpole's intervention prevents this.Other Staff at 3 Equity Court, London:\n\nAlbert Handyside (Derek Benfield) (Series 1\u20132 and Special): The original clerk of Chambers. Fired in the third episode, he remains friendly with Rumpole and gets him the occasional case from the firm of solicitors that he joins as a clerk.\nHenry Trench (Jonathan Coy): Albert's successor as the efficient but harried clerk of Chambers. Unhappily married, Henry is also an amateur dramatics enthusiast, frequently appearing in works by No\u00ebl Coward. Henry's wife is active in local politics and serves as a member and later mayor of their local borough council.\nDianne (Maureen Darbyshire) (Series 1\u20136 and Special): The oft-seen but rarely heard Chambers secretary, and Henry's flame. She eventually leaves Chambers and marries.\nDot Clapton (Camille Coduri) (Series 7): The new Chambers secretary after Diane leaves. A friendly chatterbox, especially in contrast to the quiet Diane.Frequent courtroom allies and adversaries:\n\nMr Bernard (Edward de Souza) (Series 1); (Denis Lill) (Series 3\u20137): An instructing solicitor who frequently presents Rumpole with clients \u2013 often a hapless member of the Timson clan. Known to Rumpole as \"Bonny Bernard\".\nHis Honour Judge Roger Bullingham (Bill Fraser) (Series 1\u20134 and Special): \"The Mad Bull\", Rumpole's most notorious courtroom enemy. Noted for his intense dislike of defending barristers in general, and of Rumpole in particular.\nMr Justice Vosper (Donald Eccles) (Series 2): A humourless, elderly judge who does not like Rumpole.\nDetective Inspector Brush (Struan Rodger) (Series 2\u20135): A police officer intent on seeing accused criminals put away. Rumpole is generally contemptuous of Inspector Brush and his \"unreliable notebook\".\nMr Justice Gerald Graves (Robin Bailey) (Series 4\u20137): Another in a long line of judges who dislikes Rumpole's courtroom theatrics. Privately referred to by Rumpole as \"Mr. Justice Gravestone\", and once referred to as \"Mr. Injustice Death's Head\". Originally merely Judge Graves, elevated to high court status in the series 6 episode \"Rumpole at Sea\".\nMr Justice Oliver Oliphant (James Grout) (Series 6\u20137): A judge whose affectations of Northern bluntness and \"common sense\" drive Rumpole to distraction and disdain.Others in Rumpole's life:\n\nLady Marigold Featherstone (Joanna Van Gyseghem): Guthrie's social-climbing wife.\nFred Timson (Peter Childs) (Series 1\u20132); (John Bardon) (Series 4\u20137): Head of the Timson clan, a family of \"minor South London villains\". The Timsons, who specialise in non-violent petty theft, often turn to Rumpole to defend them against charges arising from their latest brush with the law. Although many Timsons are seen through the course of the series, only Fred and Dennis (below) are series regulars.\nDennis Timson (Ron Pember) (Series 4\u20137): Another member of the Timson clan who frequently requires Rumpole's services, either for himself or for a family member.\nTony Timson (Phil Davis) (Series 5, Episode 4): Yet another member of the Timson clan, this one features prominently in \"Rumpole and the Tap End\".\nPeter \"Peanuts\" Molloy (David Squire) (Series 1, Episode1; Series 4, Episode 6; Series 5, Episode 4): Member of the Molloy family, archrivals of the Timsons. This legume-lover has frequent run-ins with the law. Also known to date April Timson, wife of Tony Timson.\nJack Pomeroy (Peter Whitaker) (Series 1); (Eric Dodson) (Series 3\u20135): Owner of Pomeroy's Wine Bar, to which Rumpole often repairs for a glass of \"Pomeroy's Plonk\".\nKeith (Peter Cartwright) (Series 2 and 5): Almost invariably referred to as \"Old Keith from the Lord Chancellor's office\". Has the ear of the Lord Chancellor, and is largely responsible (it seems) for determining who will be promoted to Queen's Counsel, or to judgeships.\nDodo Mackintosh (Ann Way) (Series 3\u20135): A school friend of Hilda's who is often mentioned. Barely tolerated by Rumpole, she stops by to visit the Rumpoles on several occasions. Her maiden name is Dodo Perkins.\nF. I. G. \"Fig\" Newton (Full name: Ferdinand Isaac Gerald Newton) (Jim Norton) (Series 3); (Frank Mills) (Series 5\u20136): Rumpole's favourite private investigator, who is usually battling a cold as he's often called on to tail suspects through the pouring rain. In his first appearance, when played by Norton, he introduces himself as Ferdinand Ian Gilmour Newton. All later appearances were by Mills, and in these appearances Rumpole refers to him as Ferdinand Isaac Gerald Newton.\nMarguerite \"Matey\" Ballard (Rowena Cooper) (Series 5\u20137): The matron of the Old Bailey and widow of Mr Plumstead, who later becomes \"Soapy Sam\" Ballard's incongruously blunt wife.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This kingdom included, most notably, the bishoprics of Tours, Poitiers and Orl\u00e9ans. Chlodomer married Guntheuc, with whom he had three sons: Theodebald, Gunthar, and Clodoald.In 523\u201324, possibly at the instigation of his mother Clotilde, who was eager to avenge the death of her parents who had been allegedly assassinated by her uncle Gundobad, the father of Sigismund of Burgundy. From the sixth century on, the marriage of Clovis and Clotilde was made the theme of epic narratives, in which the original facts were materially altered and the various versions found their way into the works of different Frankish chroniclers. The story of Clotilde's revenge is taken up by Gregory of Tours. It is, however, assumed that this tale is apocryphal.Nonetheless, Chlodomer joined with his brothers in an expedition against the Burgundians.

Having developed a life-threatening fever, the king summoned the High Court in June and made Guy regent. Baldwin retained only the royal title and the city of Jerusalem. Guy proved far too unpopular to be an effective military leader, and gravely insulted the incapacitated king by refusing to exchange Jerusalem for Tyre.Saladin attacked Kerak Castle in late 1183 while the wedding of Sibylla's half-sister Isabella to Humphrey of Toron was celebrated. Baldwin summoned his troops. Not trusting him to efficiently command the army, the king deprived Guy of regency and, effectively, of his place in the line of succession. The succession was then deliberated by the assembled nobility, which included Guy, Agnes, Bohemond of Antioch, Raymond of Tripoli, Raynald of Sidon, and the Ibelin brothers, but not Sibylla's supporters Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon and Joscelin of Courtenay. Eventually Agnes's proposal that Sibylla's five-year-old son, Baldwin V, be crowned co-king was accepted because his was the next strongest claim after Sibylla's. The coronation took place on 20 November, and the boy received the homage of all the barons except his stepfather. Baldwin IV and his army then relieved the siege of Kerak.\nThe question of who would rule the kingdom as regent for Baldwin V troubled the disabled king. Sibylla and Guy would have the best claim to regency if Baldwin IV died. Her brother knew that this could only be prevented by having their marriage annulled and discussed the matter with the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Heraclius. Baldwin failed to take into account Sibylla's steadfast devotion to Guy as well as Guy's friendship with Heraclius, who may have warned the count about Baldwin's intentions. Instead of going to Jerusalem with the rest of the army after lifting the siege of Kerak, Guy went straight to Ascalon and sent a message to Sibylla, who joined him there. The annulment could not proceed without their presence, and the couple's refusal to leave Ascalon despite the king's summons frustrated the scheme to separate them. Baldwin next attempted to confiscate Jaffa and Ascalon, but only succeeded in revoking Jaffa.On Baldwin IV's deathbed in early 1185, the right to rule the kingdom as regent in the name of Baldwin V, then a sickly child, was offered to the count of Tripoli. Raymond accepted the regency on the condition that the pope should, on the advice of the Holy Roman emperor and the kings of England and France, decide whether the crown should pass to Sibylla or Isabella in case of Baldwin V's premature death. The High Court accepted the conditions and swore an oath to him in the presence of Baldwin IV. Guardianship of the boy was awarded to his granduncle Joscelin of Courtenay. Raymond's party were determined to prevent Sibylla's accession; they questioned her legitimacy on the basis of the annulment of her parents' marriage and emphasized that her half-sister, Isabella, was born to a reigning king. The latter argument, resting on the Byzantine idea of being \"born in the purple\", may have come from Isabella's Byzantine mother, Maria Komnene. Baldwin IV died in March 1185 or before 16 May 1185 at the latest, when Sibylla's son, Baldwin V, is recorded as the sole king. Baldwin V's paternal grandfather, Marquis William V of Montferrat, arrived in Jerusalem to safeguard the young king's rights.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The historian Steven Runciman called him one of the greatest persons in history. Despite a number of military setbacks, the reign of Boris I was marked with significant events that shaped Bulgarian and European history. With the Christianization of Bulgaria in 864, paganism was abolished. A skillful diplomat, Boris I successfully exploited the conflict between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Papacy to secure an autocephalous Bulgarian Church, thus dealing with the nobility's concerns about Byzantine interference in Bulgaria's internal affairs.\nWhen in 885 the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius were banished from Great Moravia, Boris I gave them refuge and provided assistance which saved the Glagolithic and later promoted the development of the Cyrillic script in Preslav and the Slavic literature. After he abdicated in 889, his eldest son and successor tried to restore the old pagan religion but was deposed by Boris I. During the Council of Preslav which followed that event, the Byzantine clergy was replaced with Bulgarian, and the Greek language was replaced with what is now known as Old Church Slavonic.\nHe is regarded as a saint in the Orthodox Church, as the Prince and baptizer of Bulgaria, and as Equal-to-the-Apostles, with his feast day observed on May 2 and in Synaxis of all venerable and holy Fathers of Bulgaria (movable holiday on the 2nd Sunday of Pentecost).", "hasanswer": true}]}

Darius I married Otanes' daughter Phaedymia while Otanes married a sister of Darius, who gave birth to Amestris.\nWhen Darius died in 486 BC, Amestris was married to the crown prince, Xerxes.

Also since most accounts of the time are from Greek sources, and due to the involvement of Greece as an opponent of Persia, it is possible that not all accounts are accurate.\nCirca 478 BC, her son Crown Prince Darius was married to his cousin Artaynte at Sardis. She was the daughter of Xerxes' brother Masistes. At the behest of Xerxes, Artaynte committed adultery with him (Xerxes). When Amestris found out, she did not seek revenge against Artaynte, but against her mother, Masistes' wife, as Amestris thought that it was her connivance.

He also began to relax from his early diligence in governing the state. He also became less diligent in the inspection of false reports by officials. For example, there were large numbers of reported sightings of fenghuang (Chinese phoenixes) \u2013 mythological birds who were considered symbols of divine favor\u2014during this period, and while in ancient China there might have been \"legitimate\" sightings of phoenixes (that is, rare birds that were then-considered phoenixes), a good number of these reports were later shown to be likely hoaxes, but Emperor Xuan accepted these reports without critically examining them: although in the case of reported sightings of a green rooster and golden horse in Shu (modern Sichuan), Xuan did dispatch one of his favored poets and a Shu native, Wang Bao, to investigate and to bring back the golden horse, if found (though Wang became ill and died on the way). However, in general, Emperor Xuan's reign, even in this period, was marked by his concern for the people and unwillingness to undertake military action unless necessary. For example, in 59 BC, a major Xiongnu civil war broke out\u2014which would leave the Xiongnu princes fighting each other for years. Many generals wanted to use this opportunity to completely and thoroughly annihilating the Xiongnu. But Emperor Xuan didn't want to do so, rather he encouraged peace among the Xiongnu princes with hopes of having them submit to him.\nHis efforts paid off. By 56 BC, Xiongnu had been fractured into three separate regimes, ruled by Chanyus Runzhen (\u958f\u632f), Huhanye (\u547c\u97d3\u90aa), and Zhizhi. All three sought peace with Han, and Han was able to reduce its military defense forces by a fifth, decreasing the burdens on the people correspondingly. In 54 BC, Chanyu Runzhen was defeated and killed by Chanyu Zhizhi, who further sought to try to defeat Chanyu Huhanye to reunify Xiongnu. In response, in 53 BC, at the advice of his official, Chanyu Huhanye headed south and requested to become a Han vassal to seek Han protection. In 51 BC, Chanyu Huhanye made an official visit to Chang'an as a Han vassal, and Emperor Xuan, correctly judging that he should seek to have Huhanye submit to him out of gratitude and not of fear, ordered that Huhanye not be required to bow to him and that he be treated as higher than imperial princes. Emperor Xuan also commissioned an expedition force to assist Chanyu Huhanye in defending his territory. In 49 BC, Chanyu Huhanye made a second visit. With Han assistance, his strength grew, and Chanyu Zhizhi, who had previously been stronger, was forced to move west.\nIn 53 BC, disappointed in Crown Prince Shi's overreliance on Confucian officials and lack of resolve, he considered making Liu Qin, the Prince of Huaiyang, the crown prince instead, but could not bring himself to do so\u2014remembering how Prince Shi's mother Empress Xu was his first love and had been murdered by poisoning, and also how he depended on his father-in-law in his youth.\nIn 51 BC, after Chanyu Huhanye's visit, Emperor Xuan, in his most shining moment, remembered key officials who had been instrumental in his success. In an unprecedented action, he had the portraits of 11 of them be painted onto the main gallery of the main imperial palace, the Weiyang Palace. The 11 officials were:\n\nHuo Guang\nZhang Anshi\nHan Zeng (\u97d3\u589e)\nZhao Chongguo\nWei Xiang\nBing Ji\nDu Yannian (\u675c\u5ef6\u5e74)\nLiu De (\u5289\u5fb7)\nLiang Qiuhe (\u6881\u4e18\u8cc0)\nXiao Wangzhi (\u856d\u671b\u4e4b)\nSu WuHuo was referred only by titles and not by name\u2014which was considered an even greater honor than given to the other 10.\nBy this time, the Western Han Dynasty would reach its peak in terms of territorial size, even greater than during the reign of Emperor Wu.\n\nEmperor Xuan died in 49 BC.

Both portraits were exhibited at the Salon of 1759 and received praise.  Drouais attended the meetings of the Acad\u00e9mie royale and, from 1755 until his death in 1775, exhibited regularly at the official Salons held in the Louvre in Paris.\nDrouais was a favourite portrait painter of Jeanne Be\u00e7u, comtesse du Barry (1743\u201393) and, from 1772 until his death, held the position of premier peintre to Louis-Stanislas-Xavier, comte de Provence (1755\u20131824), known as Monsieur, later Louis XVIII. Mesdames de France, the daughters of Louis XV, were also important patrons. They recommended him to their father, Louis XV, when a portraitist was sought to travel to Vienna to paint the young Marie-Antoinette. Drouais was approached, but his commission fee was regarded as too high. Ducreux went instead.\nSome of Drouais's pupils include Catherine Lusurier, his son Jean-Germain Drouais, Jean-Louis Voille, and Pierre-Hippolyte Lemoyne.\nAmong his portraits include those of Louis XV, Louis's official mistresses Madame de Pompadour and Madame du Barry, Mesdames de France, the comte and comtesse de Provence, the comte de Buffon, Madame Favart, and the young Marie-Antoinette.", "hasanswer": true}]}

In order to avoid punishing Zhao Sheng personally, Zhao She arrested and killed the nine administrators who kept accounts for Zhao Sheng's family. Zhao Sheng became very angry and wanted to kill Zhao She.However, Zhao She scolded Zhao Sheng for not upholding the law of the state. Zhao She also reminded Zhao Sheng that as an aristocrat, he should be an example in abiding by the law and not infringing on it lest the state would perish. Zhao Sheng realised that he was wrong and he not only apologised to Zhao She, but also recommended him to the ruler for promotion. Zhao She subsequently was promoted as the land tax collector of the whole state.\nIn 271 BCE the State of Qin sent a large army to attack Han, but would have to attack the Zhao territory in the way.

He is commonly identified with the Gurgenes (\u0393\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, Hellenized form of Middle Persian Gurg\u0113n) of the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes.\nGuaram was born to Leo, the younger son of king Vakhtang I Gorgasali and his Roman consort Helene, thus being a member of the younger, non-royal branch of the Chosroid dynasty, which was in possession of the southwestern Iberian duchies of Klarjeti and Javakheti. He is reported by the medieval Georgian author Sumbat Davitis-Dze to be the first Bagrationi ruler, a claim that has not been accepted as credible.When the war between the Roman and Sasanian empires resumed under Justin II (r. 565\u2013578), Guaram/Gurgenes allied himself with the Armenian prince Vardan III Mamikonian and the Romans in a desperate attempt to break free of Sasanian control in 572 (Theoph. Byz. Fr. 3). He apparently fled to Constantinople when the uprising failed and remained there until he reappeared on political scene in 588, when the Iberians are reported by the Georgian chronicler Juansher to have revolted from the Sasanid rule again. The Iberian nobles asked the emperor Maurice (r. 582\u2013602) for a ruler from the Iberian royal house; Maurice sent Guaram, conferring on him the dignity of curopalates and sending him to Mtskheta. Thus, the presiding principate of Iberia replaced the Chosroid kingship dormant since its suppression by the Sasanids c. 580. He has traditionally been credited with the foundation of the Jvari Monastery at Mtskheta. Guaram was succeeded by his son, Stephen I.Guaram I was the first Georgian ruler to take the unusual step of issuing coins modeled on the silver drachms of the Sasanids. These coins, referred to as the \"Iberian-Sasanid\", feature the initials GN, i.e., Gurgen.

He was thus probably also involved in the murder of the last Achaemenid king Darius III. After Bessus was captured by the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great, Oxyartes and his family continued to resist the Macedonians, and, along with other notables such as the Sogdian warlord Spitamenes, took up a defensive position in a fortress known as the Sogdian Rock.They were eventually defeated by Alexander, who attended a celebration, and reportedly fell in love with Roxana on sight. The location of the celebration took place is disputed, possibly in the Sogdian Rock or another fortress of Chorienes (also called Sisimithres by Quintus Rufus Curtius), but according to the Metz Epitome it was in the house of Chorienes in which Roxana was introduced to Alexander as the daughter of Oxyartes.  Curtius apparently misrepresented Roxana as a daughter of Chorienes. Arrian states that Oxyartes surrendered to Alexander when he became aware of the good reception Alexander awarded his daughter Roxana. A.B. Bosworth mentions the possibility of Roxana being captured at the Sogdian Rock, but that the two married at the fortress of Chorienes. The marriage was in 327 BC, and according to the majority of the sources it was in the Macedonian rite rather than the Persian.Alexander married Roxana despite opposition from his companions who would have preferred a Macedonian or other Greek to become queen. However, the marriage was also politically advantageous as it made the Sogdian army more loyal towards Alexander and less rebellious after their defeat. Alexander thereafter made an expedition into India and while there he appointed Oxyartes as the governor of the Hindu Kush region adjoining India. Roxana accompanied Alexander into India, where her first son died at or soon after birth near the banks of the Acesines River  in November 326 BC. \nWhen Alexander returned to Susa in spring 324 BC, he promoted a brother of Roxana to the elite cavalry. To encourage a better acceptance of his government among the Persians, Alexander also married Stateira II, the daughter of the deposed Persian king Darius III.After Alexander's sudden death at Babylon in 323 BC, Roxana is believed to have murdered Stateira. According to Plutarch, she also had Stateira's sister, Drypetis, murdered with the consent of Perdiccas. Roxana was pregnant, which caused some discussions between Alexander's loyalists around Perdiccas and Ptolemy who suggested waiting to see if Alexander's posthumous child was a son and naming either a caretaker regent or a council to govern on his behalf, and the Macedonian soldiers who opposed a so-called persianization of the Macedonian court.For the Macedonian succession a temporary compromise was found as Philip Arrhidaeus was declared king of Macedon; if the unborn child was a son, he was to become a king as well. By 317 though, Roxana's son, called Alexander IV lost his kingship as a result of intrigues started by Philip Arrhidaeus' wife, Eurydice II. Afterwards, Roxana and the young Alexander were protected by Alexander the Great's mother, Olympias, in Macedonia. Following Olympias' assassination in 316 BC, Cassander imprisoned Roxana and her son in the citadel of Amphipolis. Their detention was condemned by the Macedonian general Antigonus in 315 BC. In 311 BC, a peace treaty between Antigonus and Cassander confirmed the kingship of Alexander IV but also Cassander as his guardian, following which the Macedonians demanded his release.  However, Cassander ordered Glaucias of Macedon to kill Alexander and Roxana. It is assumed that they were murdered in spring 310 BC, but their death was concealed until the summer.

Nine years later, census-takers come to count the people living in the Long Kloof. They are shocked that a white child is living with a Coloured family and somehow come to the conclusion that the white child must be the child lost by the van Rooyens who live in the Forest. Fiela is distraught that her child is being taken away and travels to speak with the magistrate which fails because the magistrate is a white supremacist. The magistrate warns Fiela that if she interferes any more she will be dealt with. The child is taken away from her and forced to live with the van Rooyens who make beams from wood. His living conditions with the white people are much worse than with his Coloured family. Elias van Rooyen continuously abuses the family and everyone is thoroughly miserable. The child, Benjamin Komoetie, is forced to take up the name of Lukas van Rooyen and falls in love with his apparent sister, Nina van Rooyen. The climax of the story unfolds a few years later when the boy forces his \"mother's\" guilt to confess that he is not actually her son and he returns to Fiela and her family, whom he chooses as his own.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She was the wife of Liu Chang (\u5289\u8407), the Marquis of Jiedu Village (\u89e3\u72a2\u4ead\u4faf). (Liu Chang was a great-grandson of Liu Kai (\u5289\u958b), the sixth son of Emperor Zhang.) In 156, she bore Liu Chang a son, Liu Hong. It is not known whether she had any other children.\nIn January 168, after Emperor Huan died without a son to succeed him, his wife Empress Dou (later empress dowager) selected 12-year-old Liu Hong, the Marquis of Jiedu Village, to be the new emperor. He is historically known as Emperor Ling. The newly crowned Emperor Ling awarded his late father the posthumous title \"Emperor Xiaoren\" (\u5b5d\u4ec1\u7687) and named his father's burial place \"Shen Mausoleum\" (\u614e\u9675); he also gave his mother the title \"Honoured Lady of Shen Garden (\u614e\u5712\u8cb4\u4eba)\" in April or May 168. In 169, following the downfall of Empress Dowager Dou and her clan, Emperor Ling sent his attendants to fetch his mother from Hejian Commandery to live in Yongle Palace (\u6c38\u6a02\u5bae) in Luoyang, the imperial capital. He also honoured her as \"Empress Xiaoren\" (\u5b5d\u4ec1\u7687\u540e) on 17 April 169, and appointed his mother's elder brother, Dong Chong (\u8463\u5bf5), as Bearer of the Mace (\u57f7\u91d1\u543e). Dong Chong was later imprisoned for lying that he was acting on Empress Dowager Dong's order; he died in prison.Empress Dowager Dong was not involved in state affairs until after Empress Dowager Dou's death in 172. She encouraged Emperor Ling to start the practice of selling government offices for money; this practice severely damaged the Han civil service system and led to widespread corruption. In 188, her nephew, Dong Zhong (\u8463\u91cd), was promoted from Minister of the Guards (\u885b\u5c09) to General of Agile Cavalry (\u9a43\u9a0e\u5c07\u8ecd) and put in command of over 1,000 troops.In 181, one of Emperor Ling's consorts, Beautiful Lady Wang (\u738b\u7f8e\u4eba), bore him a son, Liu Xie (Emperor Xian). Beautiful Lady Wang was subsequently poisoned to death by Emperor Ling's empress, Empress He, so the motherless Liu Xie was raised by his grandmother. Empress Dowager Dong often urged Emperor Ling to designate one of his only two surviving sons, Liu Xie and Liu Bian (born to Empress He), as crown prince. Empress He and Empress Dowager Dong became engaged in a rivalry because they wanted Liu Bian and Liu Xie respectively to be crown prince. Emperor Ling died in 189 before he could name one of them as his successor.Despite the machinations of Jian Shuo (a eunuch and close aide of Emperor Ling) to put Liu Xie on the throne, Empress He and her brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, succeeded in making Liu Bian emperor; Liu Bian is historically known as Emperor Shao. As the mother of the reigning emperor, Empress He became empress dowager, while Empress Dowager Dong became grand empress dowager. The empress dowager and grand empress dowager started vying for influence in court politics; their respective pillars of support, He Jin and Dong Zhong, were also locked in a power struggle. Grand Empress Dowager Dong contemplated getting Dong Zhong to help her eliminate He Jin. When Empress Dowager He heard about it, she informed He Jin and another brother of hers, He Miao (\u4f55\u82d7). They decided to take preemptive action against the grand empress dowager.One day, He Jin, He Miao and their supporters found an excuse to remove Grand Empress Dowager Dong from Yongle Palace and send her back to her hometown in Hejian Commandery, so they raised their idea in the imperial court. The court officials and Empress Dowager He approved the idea. He Jin then sent his troops to surround Dong Zhong's residence and arrest him; he committed suicide later. Grand Empress Dowager Dong sank into paranoia and depression after hearing news of Dong Zhong's death and died of illness in 189 after being in power for about 22 years. The common people blamed Empress Dowager He and her family for the grand empress dowager's death. Grand Empress Dowager Dong's remains were transported back to Hejian Commandery and buried alongside her husband's in the Shen Mausoleum.", "hasanswer": false}]}
