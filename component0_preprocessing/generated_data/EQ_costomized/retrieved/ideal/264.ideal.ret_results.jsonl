James Brown first began his career as a member of the Famous Flames, emerging as the lead singer by the time of their first appearance in a professional recording, \"Please, Please, Please\", in 1956.\nOn hit songs such as \"Try Me\", \"Bewildered\", \"Think\", \"I Don't Mind\", and \"I'll Go Crazy\", the Flames' smooth backing harmonies contrasted strikingly with Brown's raw, impassioned singing, and their synchronized dance steps were a prominent feature of their live shows. Altogether, James Brown and the Famous Flames numerous R&B hit songs reached the Top 40 on the R&B and pop charts.They also appeared in the Hollywood films T.A.M.I. Show (1964) and Ski Party. Members of the Flames also contributed as songwriters and choreographers. In 2012 the Flames were retroactively inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside Brown. On their Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page, they are described as \"a group of singers, performers and dancers that created the complementary elements of one of the greatest stage shows of all time.\"\nAs of  2020, The Famous Flames were also inducted into The National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame.The Famous Flames are sometimes erroneously identified as James Brown's \"band\", a confusion partly fostered by their record companies' inconsistent labeling credit practices. Although members of the group did play instruments in some of their earliest shows and recordings, by 1959 Brown had hired a touring band and from that point on, the Flames contributed primarily as backing vocalists and dancers.

Musically, the song differs from most of band's previous output, leaving the garage rock genre for Latin American influences, such as bai\u00e3o. Lyrically, \"Groovin'\" tells the tale of a narrator spending time with his partner on a Sunday afternoon. The song was arranged and recorded at the Talentmasters Studios, New York City in March of 1967.\nInitially, Atlantic Records were skeptical of releasing \"Groovin'\" as a single, given that it deviated from their previous output. After hearing it, the disc jockey Murray the K convinced Jerry Wexler to release it. \"Groovin'\" was released as a single on April 10, 1967 backed by \"Sue\u00f1o\". It became a commercial hit, reaching number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1967. It peaked at number eight in the UK as the Young Rascals' only hit there.\nUpon initial release, \"Groovin'\" received widespread critical acclaim by critics, who noted the new direction the Young Rascals took with the single. Owing to the success, it became the title track of the band's third studio album. Retrospective appraisal of the single have often noted the experimental nature of the single. Shortly after the release of the original, Booker T. & the M.G.'s recorded a cover that reached number 21 on Billboard Hot 100, while War and Pato Banton have seen success with their versions.

The band's songwriter/guitarist Gary Kemp realised after the release of their second album that the nightclub audience they initially wanted to attract had lost interest in them in part because of the band's transition from dance music to pop. He no longer felt obligated to keep writing music for them and shifted his focus to soul and R&B influences such as Marvin Gaye and Al Green for this album. Kemp thought that bandmate Steve Norman's newfound interest in the saxophone would be well-suited to the sound he was going for, as would the decision to record most of the album at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas.\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to begin work on the album with producer Trevor Horn, the band tested out their working relationship with Tony Swain and Steve Jolley while recording its first single, \"Lifeline\", and chose to produce the album alongside them. \"Lifeline\" was a top ten hit on the UK Singles Chart, and its follow-up, \"Communication\", also did well. The album became available as the second single climbed the charts, and the overwhelming response to the title track dictated its release as the third single from the album, leading it to four weeks as the most popular song in the UK. It also became their first song to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, where it peaked at number four. A fourth single, \"Gold\", reached number two in the UK but only got as high as 29 in the US, which Kemp attributed to internal conflicts at their record label that took time away from promoting the band.\nOn the album charts, True reached number one in the UK and number 19 in the US while also having success in numerous other countries. It achieved platinum certification for sales of 300,000 units in the UK less than three months after its release. Most critics thought the album was enjoyable, but there were those who found something or much to dislike. The choice of suits for the album photos and \"True\" music video was thought to have misled US audiences by presenting them as too clean cut to have much else to offer other than soul ballads like the title song.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The latter song includes a brief interlude of the Velvet Underground song, \"Sister Ray\".The album helped increase Richman's cultural profile, which would include a 1993 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien during which Richman performed one of the album's songs, \"I Was Dancing in the Lesbian Bar.\"The album was recorded through the summer of 1991 \"in John 'Guitar' Girton's cozy frayed carpet of a basement studio\" in the \"summer swelter\" of Grass Valley, California. \nThe album was originally released on Cassette and Compact Disc, but was released by Craft Recordings on vinyl for the first time in 2020.", "hasanswer": true}]}

After the album's release, Martin embarked on the worldwide Livin' la Vida Loca Tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2000 by a Latin artist.\nThe album was supported by four singles. The lead single \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" topped the charts in more than 20 countries and is considered to be Martin's biggest hit and one of the best-selling singles of all time. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five consecutive weeks, becoming Martin's first number one single on the chart. Follow-up singles \"She's All I Ever Had\", \"Shake Your Bon-Bon\", and \"Private Emotion\" became number one and top 10 hits around the world. Ricky Martin received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its various genres and styles. Paste ranked the album as one of the \"10 Best Solo Albums by Former Boy Band Members\" in 2020. It was nominated for Best Pop Album at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards.\nThe album was a commercial success. It debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 661,000 copies, becoming the largest sales week by any album in 1999 and breaking the record as the largest first-week sales for any pop or Latin artist in history. Additionally, it made Martin the first male Latin act in history to debut at number one on Billboard 200. Ricky Martin also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and Spain, among others. The album has received several certifications, including 7\u00d7 platinum in the United States, and diamond in Canada. Only within three months, it became the best-selling album ever by a Latin artist. It is generally seen as the album that began the \"Latin explosion\" and paved the way for a large number of other Latin artists such as Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Christina Aguilera, Marc Anthony, Santana, and Enrique Iglesias.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The album was a follow-up to the Official National Lampoon Stereo Test and Demonstration Record, which was released in 1974. The tape is however a completely different album consisting of entirely new material.\nThe album was conceived and written by National Lampoon contributing editor Ed Subitzky. The designer and writer for the wrapper (which was a spoof of consumer advertising) was Tibor Kalman, at M& co studio, and the sound designer for the album itself was Bob Pomann. The album was directed by Maurice Peterson, who also cast the album, and voice-acted several parts: a person with whiplash, a truck driver and a hobo.The cassette is the main item in the Official National Lampoon Stereo Test & Demonstration Kit, which also includes a faux leather \"travel case\", cotton swabs, and a small bottle of cleaner fluid (for cleaning the heads on a cassette deck).The album is a parody of stereo test and demonstration records, which were used by hi-fi enthusiasts to test the performance of their audio systems. All of the items recorded on the tape are comedy sketches; the majority of them are also functional car stereo tests. One sketch is an old-fashioned country music song of love lost, where the lyrics use tones that vary from 30 cycles per second (now known as the hertz) up to 15,000 cycles per second. Another sketch explains to the consumer how to play a trick on passengers in the car by using the left and right, as well as front and back, speaker volume controls to make it appear that fart noises are emanating from one particular area inside the car. Other comedy sketches help determine if a unit is in phase or out of phase, and whether a system has good left-right separation. The effects of interference noise and poor reception on car stereos are also demonstrated in comic ways.\nAn advertisement for the Official National Lampoon Car Stereo Test and Demonstration Tape ran in the July 1980 issue of National Lampoon magazine.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "264_75", "question": "What music label is Revolver represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_52572", "text": "Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied by the double A-side single \"Eleanor Rigby\" / \"Yellow Submarine\". The album was the Beatles' final recording project before their retirement as live performers and marked the group's most overt use of studio technology to date, building on the advances of their late 1965 release Rubber Soul. It has since become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in the history of popular music, with recognition centred on its range of musical styles, diverse sounds and lyrical content.\nThe Beatles recorded Revolver after taking a three-month break at the start of 1966, and during a period when London was feted as the era's cultural capital. Regarded by some commentators as the start of the group's psychedelic period, the songs reflect their interest in the drug LSD, Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde while addressing themes such as death and transcendence of material concerns. With no plans to reproduce their new material in concert, the band made liberal use of automatic double tracking, varispeed, reversed tapes, close audio miking, and instruments outside of their standard live set-up. Among its tracks are \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", incorporating heavy Indian drone and a collage of tape loops; \"Eleanor Rigby\", a song about loneliness featuring a string octet as its only musical backing; and \"Love You To\", a foray into Hindustani classical music. The sessions also produced a non-album single, \"Paperback Writer\", backed with \"Rain\".\nIn the United Kingdom, the album's 14 tracks were gradually distributed to radio stations in the weeks before its release. In North America, Revolver was reduced to 11 songs by Capitol Records, with the omitted three appearing on the June 1966 LP Yesterday and Today. The release there coincided with the Beatles' final concert tour and the controversy surrounding John Lennon's remark that the band had become \"more popular than Jesus\". The album topped the Record Retailer chart in the UK for seven weeks and the US Billboard Top LPs list for six weeks. Critical reaction was highly favourable in the UK but less so in the US amid the press's unease at the band's outspokenness on contemporary issues.\nRevolver expanded the boundaries of pop music, revolutionised standard practices in studio recording, advanced principles espoused by the 1960s counterculture, and inspired the development of psychedelic rock, electronica, progressive rock and world music. The album cover, designed by Klaus Voormann, combined Aubrey Beardsley-inspired line drawing with photo collage and won the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts. Aided by the 1987 international CD release, which standardised its content to the original Parlophone version, Revolver has surpassed Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) in many critics' estimation as the Beatles' best album. It was ranked first in the 1998 and 2000 editions of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums and third in the 2003 and 2012 editions of Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". It has been certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and 5\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Their most active recording period was in the 1960s and '70s, and, after several years inactive as a duo, Hatfield and Medley reunited in 1981 and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003. The term \"blue-eyed soul\" is thought to have first been coined by Philadelphia radio DJ Georgie Woods in 1964 when describing the duo's music.Hatfield and Medley had contrasting vocal ranges, which helped them create a distinctive sound as a duet. They each had the vocal talent to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his bass-baritone voice, with Hatfield taking the higher-register vocals with his tenor. His voice reached the register of a countertenor.Following a year and a half of Top 40 non-entries on Billboard's Hot 100, the duo hit big with the late-1964 release of what would become their signature record, \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" \u2013 a transatlantic number one produced by Phil Spector, often considered one of his finest works and a landmark recording in popular music.

Records in the US. As a result of the Sex Pistols' volatile internal relationships, the band's lineup saw changes during the recording of the album. Original bass guitarist Glen Matlock left the band early in the recording process, and while he is credited as a co-writer on all but two of the tracks, he only played bass and sang backing vocals on one track, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" Recording sessions continued with a new bass player, Sid Vicious, who is credited on two of the songs written by the band after he joined. While Vicious's bass playing appeared on two tracks, his lack of skill on the instrument meant that many of the tracks were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones playing bass instead. Drummer Paul Cook, Jones and singer Johnny Rotten appear on every track. The various recording sessions were led alternately by Chris Thomas or Bill Price, and sometimes both together, but as the songs on the final albums often combined mixes from different sessions, or were poorly documented who was present in the recording booth at the time, each song is jointly credited to both producers.\nBy the time of its release, the Sex Pistols were already controversial, having spoken profanity on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from playing live in some parts of Britain. The album title added to that controversy, with some people finding the word \"bollocks\" offensive. Many record stores refused to carry it and some record charts refused to list its title, showing just a blank space instead. Due in part to its notoriety, and in spite of many sales bans at major retailers, the album debuted at number one on the UK Album Charts. It achieved advance orders of 125,000 copies after a week of its release and went gold only a few weeks later, on 17 November. It remained a best-seller for nearly a year, spending 48 weeks in the top 75. The album has also been certified platinum by the RIAA. It has seen several reissues, the latest in 2017.\nThe album has influenced many bands and musicians, and the industry in general. In particular, the album's raw energy, and Johnny Rotten's sneering delivery and \"half-singing\", are often considered game changing. It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album, and one of the greatest and most important albums of all time. In 1987, Rolling Stone magazine named the album the second best of the previous 20 years, behind only the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The same magazine ranked it 73rd on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2020. In 2006, it was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest albums ever.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The lyrics, which address the value of female friendship over heterosexual relationships, became a symbol of female empowerment and the most emblematic song of the group's girl power philosophy. It was written and recorded quickly. The result was considered lacklustre by their label and was sent to be mixed by Dave Way. The Spice Girls were not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, by Mark \"Spike\" Stent.\n\"Wannabe\" was heavily promoted. Its music video, directed by Johan Camitz, became a success on the British cable network the Box, which sparked press interest in the group. Subsequently, the song had intensive radio airplay across England, while the Spice Girls performed it on television and began doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines.\nResponding to the wave of interest, Virgin released the song as the Spice Girls' debut single in Japan in June 1996 and in the UK the following month, well ahead of the planned release of the Spice album. \"Wannabe\" topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and has received a quadruple platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It was released in the United States in January 1997, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was the group's only number-one single in that country.

Though he had numerous hit records, he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of Cole Porter's \"Begin the Beguine.\" Before the release of \"Beguine,\" Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and, after its release, he became a major pop artist within short order. The record eventually became one of the era's defining recordings. Musically restless, Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as Third Stream music, which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions. His music influenced other musicians, such as Monty Norman in England, whose \"James Bond Theme\" features a vamp possibly influenced by Shaw's 1938 recording of \"Nightmare\".Shaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the big bands he led. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1942 to 1944, during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific. Following his discharge in 1944, he returned to lead a band through 1945.

They formed in Chapel Hill, NC, in March 1998 as a 'joke country band', a sort of counterweight to the hyped No Depression movement. Before long, however, both the \"joke\" and the \"country\" parts of the concept were eliminated, thus allowing the band to develop into a quirky alternative rock outfit. The Comas' respectable 1999 debut, Wave to Make Friends, was composed of sleepy (but not lethargic) indie pop and off-kilter boy-and-girl vocal harmonies, courtesy of co-founders Andrew Herod and Nicole Gehweiler. The band's instrumental canvas proved to be larger and more eclectic than that of the typical indie group, buoying the usual guitars and rhythm section with violin, organ, and creative non-rap samples. Faced with the challenge of labeling such music, the Comas' label billed deemed the sound \"stoner pop.\"\nIn 2008, lead singer Andy Herod moved to Asheville, and formed a new project, called Electric Owls, which was signed to Vagrant Records. Electric Owls has produced two EPs and a full-length record titled 'Ain't Too Bright'. Assisting him in the studio were a few friends and former member Caperton.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Over the years, several other members of Ministry played with Lard, namely Bill Rieflin, Mike Scaccia, and Rey Washam.\nLike most of Biafra's work, Lard's songs are angrily political (the War on Drugs is a particularly common theme) but often have a tinge of humor.\n\nLard has not officially toured and has only performed live a handful of times, mostly around the San Francisco area (where Jello lives and operates his Alternative Tentacles record label).

The group comprised vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock.\nOriginally named the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, Led Zeppelin, was a top-ten album in several countries and featured such tracks as \"Good Times Bad Times\", \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Communication Breakdown\". Led Zeppelin II (1969) was their first number-one album, and yielded \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Ramble On\". In 1970, they released Led Zeppelin III which featured \"Immigrant Song\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history with 37 million copies sold. The album includes \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock history. Houses of the Holy (1973) yielded \"The Song Remains the Same\" and \"Over the Hills and Far Away\". Physical Graffiti (1975), a double album, featured \"The Rover\" and \"Kashmir\".\nPage composed most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones's keyboard-based compositions later became central to their music, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included Presence (1976) and In Through the Out Door (1979), grew limited, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death in 1980, feeling that they would not be \"Led Zeppelin\" without him. Since then, the surviving former members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off concerts. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham's son Jason Bonham on drums.\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time; their total record sales are estimated to be between 200 and 300 million units worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US Billboard 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the Seventies\", and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were \"as influential\" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s.", "hasanswer": true}]}

They were also a founding member of Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth occult group, and fronted the experimental pop rock band Psychic TV.\nBorn in Manchester, P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the avant-garde while at Solihull School. After dropping out of studies at the University of Hull, they moved into a counter-cultural commune in London and adopted Genesis P-Orridge as their pseudonym. On returning to Hull, they founded COUM Transmissions with Cosey Fanni Tutti, and in 1973 they relocated to London. COUM's confrontational performance work, dealing with such subjects as sex work, pornography, serial killers, and occultism, represented a concerted attempt to challenge societal norms and attracted the attention of the national press. COUM's 1976 Prostitution show at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts was particularly vilified by tabloids, gaining them the moniker of the \"wreckers of civilisation.\" P-Orridge's band, Throbbing Gristle, grew out of COUM, and were active from 1975 to 1981 as pioneers in the industrial music genre. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Psychic TV, an experimental band that from 1988 onward came under the increasing influence of acid house.\nIn 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, an informal occult order influenced by chaos magic and experimental music. P-Orridge was seen as the group's leader, but rejected that position, and left the group in 1991. Amid the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, a 1992 Channel 4 documentary accused P-Orridge of sexually abusing children, resulting in a police investigation. P-Orridge was subsequently cleared and Channel 4 retracted their allegation. As a result of the incident, P-Orridge left the United Kingdom for the United States and settled in New York City. There, they married Jacqueline Breyer, later known as Lady Jaye, in 1995, and together they embarked on the Pandrogeny Project, an attempt to unite as a \"pandrogyne\", or single entity, through the use of surgical body modification to physically resemble one another. P-Orridge continued with this project of body modification after Lady Jaye's 2007 death. Although involved in reunions of both Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV in the 2000s, they retired from music to focus on other artistic media in 2009.\nP-Orridge was credited on over 200 releases during their lifetime. They were cited as an icon within the avant-garde art scene, accrued a cult following, and had been given the moniker of the \"Godparent of Industrial Music\". P-Orridge considered themself third-gender and used various gender-neutral pronouns.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It has appeared in several critics' and listeners' polls for the best albums of all time, including Rolling Stone's 2003 list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".

Dominating its production, West was assisted by fellow producers No I.D., Plain Pat, Jeff Bhasker, and Mr Hudson, while also utilizing guest vocalists for some tracks, including Kid Cudi, Young Jeezy, and Lil Wayne.\nConceived in the wake of West's breakup with his then-fianc\u00e9e Alexis Phifer and the death of his mother Donda West in 2007, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major artistic departure from his previous rap records. Instead, West performed sung vocals that were processed through an Auto-Tune processor against an electronic production and minimalist sonic palette, including prominent use of minor keys and the Roland TR-808 drum machine. West's lyrics on the album explore themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache, inspired by the distressing personal events, as well as his struggles with pop stardom.\n808s & Heartbreak debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling just over 450,000 copies in its first week. Despite varying responses from listeners, the album received positive reviews from most music critics, who generally commended West's experimentation, and was named one of 2008's best records in several year-end lists. Four singles were released in its promotion, including the hit singles \"Love Lockdown\", which became the highest Billboard Hot 100 debut of West's career, and \"Heartless\". Despite the positive critical reception, nominations were mostly overlooked for the 52nd Grammy Awards, although the single \"Amazing\" received a nomination in the category of Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.\nAmong West's most influential records, 808s & Heartbreak made an immediate impact on hip hop, pop, and R&B music, as a new wave of rappers, singers, and producers adopted its stylistic and thematic elements. Further impact has been noted for pioneering the emo rap and experimental R&B subgenres in particular. Rolling Stone later included the album in its list of \"The 40 Most Groundbreaking Albums of All Time\" and provided a ranking at number 244 on its revised list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

Jones and Headon were replaced  by three unknowns: guitarists Vince White and Nick Sheppard and drummer Pete Howard. During the tense recording sessions, Clash manager Bernie Rhodes and Strummer fought each other for control over the band's songwriting and musical direction.\nStrummer and Rhodes co-wrote most of the songs. During production, Rhodes took charge of the arrangements, track sequencing and the final mix. His production choices, which rely heavily on Strummer's preference for synthetic drum sounds and Rhodes' own inclusion of sampling, were widely derided. One writer described the album's sound as brash and seemingly \"designed to sound hip and modern\u2014'80s style!\". Rhodes chose the album title, taken from a line in the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2.  The recording process and tension between Rhodes and Strummer left other band members disillusioned. White's and Sheppard's contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix, and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash's success in the United States, and planned an expensive video for a lead single. \nOn release, Cut the Crap was maligned in the UK music press as \"one of the most disastrous [albums] ever released by a major artist\". Strummer disowned the album and dissolved the Clash within weeks of its release. He performed only one song from the album live during his solo career, and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash's compilations and box sets.

Previously, the group had released their major-label debut, My Dinosaur Life (2010) on Columbia; the band parted ways with the label due to the record's lackluster commercial response. Following this, the band returned to their home of Minneapolis, Minnesota, with producer and longtime friend Ackerson. The band entered a local studio and recorded their next effort on their own time and finances. The band recorded Go without a label, and put it upon themselves to pay for mixing and mastering and have conversations with distributors later.\nFrontman Justin Pierre composed the lyrics for Go, which is themed around mortality, growing older, and learning to live in the moment. The reflective tone includes subjects such as procrastination, relationship miscommunication, and optimism, but also personal struggles such as the death of loved ones. Many songs on Go were developed over years at a time, and several date to the band's first few studio albums. Musically, the album retains the band's pop-rock, Moog-based sound, with a heavier emphasis on electronic experimentation. Following the album's recording, the band entered talks with Epitaph Records, where they were signed from 2003 to 2008. Discussions with label founder Brett Gurewitz led the band to re-sign with Epitaph, who co-released Go alongside the band's own label, The Boombox Generation. It is the final album by the band to feature long-time drummer Tony Thaxton before he announced his departure on March, 20th, 2013.\nGo received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, and peaked at number eight on Billboard's Independent Albums chart. \"True Romance\" was the album's lead single, and featured a one-shot music video reminiscent of the works of Spike Jonze.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Released in February 1971, just four months after the group's debut LP, the album entered Billboard's Top LP's chart in early April, having been certified gold on 25 March 1971. In its fourth week on the Top 200, the album improved on its predecessor (a no. 4 peak), reaching no. 3 (behind Janis Joplin's Pearl and Jesus Christ Superstar).\nUp to Date yielded the two big pop hits \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" (Billboard no. 6/Cash Box number one) and \"I'll Meet You Halfway\" (Billboard no. 9),  which respectively reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot 100 in March and June.\nIn Canada, both \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" and its parent album reached number one on the RPM charts.As with all Partridge Family albums (with the exception of Bulletin Board), Up to Date was produced by Wes Farrell at United Western Recorders, Studio 2 in Los Angeles. And as with the group's first album, it was engineered by Bob Kovach, with arrangements by Mike Melvoin.\nConsistent with all of the Partridge Family's studio output, the album features musicians associated with iconic Los Angeles\u2013based session players \"the Wrecking Crew\": Hal Blaine (drums), Joe Osborn (bass guitar), Mike Melvoin (keyboard), Dennis Budimir (guitar) and Louie Shelton (guitar). And once again, members of overlapping studio groups the Ron Hicklin Singers and the Love Generation \u2013 brothers John and Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin and Jackie Ward \u2013 feature prominently as backing vocalists throughout the album.\nThe album features three songs written by \"I Think I Love You\" songwriter Tony Romeo, who contributed material to all eight of the Partridge Family's studio albums. The LP also includes five songs co-written by Wes Farrell, including three with prolific lyricist Gerry Goffin (former songwriting partner of Carole King). And two of the songs \u2013 including the hit \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" \u2013 were co-written by Wes Farrell, Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, whose five Partridge Family songs as a songwriting trio include \"I Can Feel Your Heartbeat\". Between 1972 and 1975 Appel worked as manager and producer for Bruce Springsteen.\nUp to Date features David Cassidy's first contribution as a songwriter. With Wes Farrell he co-wrote the song \"Lay It on the Line\". The recording introduced a distorted guitar sound to the group's repertoire.\n\nCassidy publicly despised one of the LP's hits, \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\", and making it proved to be a very hard task. He didn't think it was a good song at all and hated the idea of his having to talk in the middle of it so much so he refused to do it. This caused consternation with the studio and the record company, prompting the involvement of the heads of both Bell Records and Screen Gems, which at the time were the respective record and television divisions of the major Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures. Production shooting of the TV series was halted in order to provide a place in time where his manager and agent could talk to him over the issue. One of the things they were saying was about how many more copies of the record would be sold if it contained a speaking role from him. They put pressure on him until he caved in and did the record as requested.  When it was finished, he was unsuccessful in trying to keep the record shelved in Bell's vaults. His feelings toward the song remained negative: It was horrible, I was embarrassed by it. I still can't listen to that record.\nThe album's distinctive cover (overseen by Bell Records art director Beverly Weinstein) was designed in the form of a calendar indicating the birth dates of the family (including dog Simone), which were the actual birth dates of the cast members. The album also included a book cover. This was the last album to feature Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris Partridge on the cover, as he left the show soon after the album's release.", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "264_447", "question": "What music label is The Deep represented by?", "ctxs": [{"id": "264_53913", "text": "The Deep was an American psychedelic rock band made up of musicians from New York City, who in 1966 traveled to Philadelphia to record a one-time LP, Psychedelic Moods.  The band was experimentally progressive, as they were one of the earliest groups to record psychedelic music, before it was adapted by a wider array of musical acts.  Although their only album failed to achieve success, it later gained acclaim for being considered the earliest work to reference \"psychedelic\" in its title.Information on the band is sparse as only one band member had a confirmed musical career prior to recording. The member, Rusty Evans (born Marcus Uzilevsky, 1937, New York City, died December 5, 2015, Woodacre, California), was the Deep's lead guitarist, primary songwriter, and a vocalist.  Evans initially recorded in 1958 as a rockabilly singer, before performing as a Greenwich Village folk musician in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  He recorded three albums as Rusty Evans \u2013 Songs of Our Land, Railroad Songs (both 1964) and Live at Gerde's Folk City (1965) \u2013 and was later a member of the folk group The New Christy Minstrels. Musician David Bromberg is also known to have played on The Deep's one and only album, although it is unknown on which tracks he played.In the early summer of 1966, Evans convinced producer Mark Barkan to help him record a psychedelic album.  They secured arrangements with the Philadelphia-based Cameo-Parkway label, the home for fellow protopunk act Question Mark and the Mysterians, for a meager budget of $1200.  In August, Evans and Barkan assembled a group of New York musicians to record as the Deep, and they drove in a rundown car to Philadelphia to record what would become the Psychedelic Moods album, which was done in the short period of four days and would necessitate late-night sessions in order to be finished on time.  The all-night sessions also provided the musicians, who were unable to afford a hotel, with a place to sleep.While the exact release date of the album has yet to be definitively established, the record is generally considered to have been distributed in October 1966, based on the album's catalogue number. This would credit it as the first official album to include the word \"psychedelic\" in its title, pre-dating the Blues Magoos' debut, Psychedelic Lollipop, and The 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. The Deep's Psychedelic Moods did not sell well, and the group did not tour to support it. They existed as a studio-only band, and, aside from sessions for their album, produced no other recordings under that name.Evans left Cameo-Parkway to record a new album for the Columbia Records label in 1967. Abandoning the \"Deep\" name, this second album was credited to the band The Freak Scene and entitled Psychedelic Psoul. Despite the name change, the band still contained the original lineup from the first album, and the sound of this album is very similar to that of Psychedelic Moods. It is typically considered a follow-up in all but name. As its title suggests, Psychedelic Psoul is composed of psychedelic-influenced tracks as the band continued to develop past concepts from their debut album. However, The Freak Scene's album met the same results as Psychedelic Moods. They did not tour, and their album did not chart. The album has been rereleased by Sony BMG through Columbia Records on vinyl. The group disbanded in late 1967.After this venture, Evans returned to performing as a solo musician. He recorded under his birthname, Marcus, for a self-titled album in 1969, which produced compositions conceived as psychedelic folk in nature. He did not record another album until 1979, when he released Life's Railway Heaven, another folk effort. Evans recorded sporadically until his death, usually in the style of folk or rockabilly music,  and in the 1990s released two new age CDs, Slice of Light and Gypsy Dreams, credited as Uzca.  He also led a Johnny Cash tribute band.  Under his real name of Marcus Uzilevsky, he was a respected visual artist best known for his landscape paintings, and was exhibited widely in California.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

The first of these were conducted at the studio \"Rotund Rascal\" on Lankershim Blvd. in North Hollywood. This initial attempt at recording the entire album with Mark Trombino as engineer, ultimately resulted in only the completion of drums, bass, Alvin's guitars, and about half of Aaron's guitar tracks. In a bold move, the band fired Trombino, and resumed work over a month later with Alex Newport at Doug Messenger's Studio in North Hollywood, on Vineland Avenue. Having recorded albums such as At The Drive-In's  before at this same studio, Newport was comfortable in moving very quickly there with the band. The album, being recorded onto tape, as opposed to Pro Tools (as was customary for most bands of the time) resulted in the majority of the album being \"first takes\". The album was also mixed quickly by the band with Newport at Messenger's Studio. It was then mastered by Mark Chalecki in the Capitol Records building.\nUpon its eventual release, the album gave the band a significant push in popularity worldwide. It was included on many \"Best Albums of 2001\" lists in various publications. In support of the album, the band toured with The Dillinger Escape Plan, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Cave In, among many others.\nAlternative versions of the album were licensed and released by Sweet Nothing in Europe, Ugly Boy Records in Australia, and Victor in Japan.

Recording sessions for the album took place during 2003 to 2004, with its production handled by his longtime collaborator Jermaine Dupri, along with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Lil Jon, among others. Primarily an R&B album, Confessions showcases Usher as a crooner through a mixture of ballads and up-tempos, incorporating musical genres of dance-pop, hip hop and crunk. The album's themes generated controversy about Usher's personal relationships; however, the album's primary producer Jermaine Dupri claimed the album reflects Dupri's own personal story.\nIn the United States, the album sold 1.1 million copies in its first week. To boost sales amid threats of bootlegging, the special edition for the album was issued, which includes the single, \"My Boo\"; a duet with Alicia Keys. Confessions earned Usher several awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album.\nAccording to Billboard, it is the second-best selling album of the 2000s decade in the United States, behind NSYNC's No Strings Attached. With over eight million copies sold in 2004, the album was viewed as a sign of recovering album sales in the US, following three years of decline. It was also exemplary of urban music's commercial peak and dominance of the Billboard charts in 2004. Confessions has been certified fourteen-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, as of 2006, has sold over 10.3 million copies in the US and over 15 million copies worldwide; making it the best-selling R&B album of the 21st century by a male artist.\nConfessions' concept, production and Usher's vocal delivery received acclaim since upon its release, and in 2020 the album was ranked number 432 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Their classic lineup (1964\u20131978) consisted of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century. Their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large public address systems, the use of synthesisers, Entwistle's and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk, power pop and mod bands. The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.\nThe Who evolved from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"I Can't Explain\" (1965), reached the UK top ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including \"My Generation\" (1965), \"Substitute\" (1966) and \"Happy Jack\" (1966). In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released \"I Can See for Miles\", their only US top-ten single. The group's 1969 concept album Tommy included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success.\nFurther festival appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight, along with the concert album Live at Leeds (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up the album Who's Next (1971), including the hits \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", \"Baba O'Riley\", and \"Behind Blue Eyes\". The group released another concept album, Quadrophenia (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy (1975). They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You (1978) was overshadowed by Moon's death shortly after.\nKenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed touring, and released a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of the group, they split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th-anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996\u20131997. A full reunion began in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with Endless Wire.  Since Entwistle's death, the Who have continued to perform and tour, most commonly with Starkey on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, and Pete's brother Simon Townshend on second guitar and backing vocals. In 2019, the group released the album Who and toured with a symphony orchestra.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The closing track \"Lay Down And Die, Goodbye\", which was originally written and recorded as a single B-side by the band when it was called Nazz, begins with a sample of Tom Smothers saying \"You are the only censor; if you don't like what I'm saying, you have a choice: you can turn me off\".

The last part of the song is listed on the Science Fiction album as \"I've Written Home to Mother\", while the instrumental jam section is listed as \"For Alice\" or \"An Instrumental\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

The album is the follow-up to her successful debut album, Thankful (2003). Breakaway sees Clarkson collaborating with various producers and songwriters for the first time, primarily Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, Ben Moody, and David Hodges; the latter two are former members of American rock band Evanescence. Despite the established commercial success of Thankful, music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an American Idol winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she was convinced by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, in pursuit of a pop rock direction. This also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release. Breakaway is primarily a pop rock record with elements of rock and soul music, marking a departure from the R&B-oriented sound of Thankful; its lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism.\nBreakaway received a positive response from music critics, with many commending the album's new-found pop rock sound and Clarkson's vocal performances. It received several awards and nominations, including winning two Grammy Awards and receiving a nomination for a Juno Award. The album became a commercial success worldwide. By selling over 12 million copies worldwide, Breakaway is Clarkson's best selling album of her career so far, and one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. After debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 in the United States, it stayed on the top twenty of the chart for more than a year, eventually being certified 6\u00d7 multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of more than six million copies.\nBreakaway's singles \"Since U Been Gone\", \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", \"Because of You\", \"Walk Away\", and \"Breakaway\" became worldwide hits and have become some of Clarkson's signature songs. Their successes prompted Billboard to credit her for landscaping the core sound of mainstream pop music as an uptempo dance-oriented sound in the 2000s. Furthermore, Breakaway established Clarkson as one of the four highest-selling acts of Sony BMG in the 2000s. Internationally, the album topped the music charts of Ireland and the Netherlands and became the world's 7th biggest-selling release of 2005, eventually being certified platinum in over 17 countries. To promote the album, Clarkson embarked on three international concert tours from 2005 to 2006: the Breakaway Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and the Addicted Tour.

Contrary to the album's title, it is not a \"live\" album but rather a studio recording.\nAlthough the album received generally positive reviews, many consumers were confused by its title and assumed it to be a live album, which in fact it was not. The title was actually a reference to Camp X-Ray, the temporary detention facility located at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Some fans and critics expressed their disappointment at the album's length, stating that a playing time of 26 minutes was not sufficient for a full-length album and that they had expected more creative output from the band. By this time, however, the band's members had drifted heavily into other projects (most notably singer/guitarist John Reis, who was simultaneously playing in Hot Snakes and Sultans and running his record label Swami Records) and were not as creatively dedicated to Rocket as they had been in the past. Cryptic liner notes written by Long Gone John seemed to indicate that the album was a \"last gasp\" of a band in turmoil and that it might be their final album.\nTouring in support of Live from Camp X-Ray was sparse due to the band members' commitments to other projects, and they would perform infrequently over the next few years. In August 2005, after breaking up Hot Snakes, Reis announced that Rocket from the Crypt would play their final performance on Halloween of that year.

It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by Virgin Records (EMI France). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist Kelly Rowland, who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by Nervo.\nAccording to Rowland, the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album Here I Am (2011), while Guetta noted \"When Love Takes Over\" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds. Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track. Veronica Ferraro mixed the song, focusing primarily on giving Rowland's vocals a magical and inspiring tone. Critics would later state that Rowland's vocals on \"When Love Takes Over\" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist. The song's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other, while the production bears some similarities to Coldplay's 2002 hit single \"Clocks\".\n\"When Love Takes Over\" received universal acclaim. Most noted the addition of Rowland's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from One Love. The song was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries, including in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland. At the time of release, it became Guetta's highest-charting single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Rowland's second number one single in the United Kingdom. \"When Love Takes Over\" ranked at number one on Billboard's Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart. In 2013, Billboard named \"When Love Takes Over\" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time, in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging electronic dance music trend in America at its time of release.\nIn the song's accompanying music video, Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together. It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result. \"When Love Takes Over\" was promoted mainly at award shows, including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards, NRJ Music Awards and the World Music Awards. Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \"When Love Takes Over\" for the annual Miss Universe competition. The single earned several Platinum and Gold certifications, selling over 5.5 million copies worldwide. Additionally, it earned Guetta two Grammy Award nominations for \"Best Dance Recording\" and \"Best Non-Classical, Remixed Recording\", the latter of which Guetta won for his \"Electro Extended Mix\" of \"When Love Takes Over\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

Development began in February 2008 where the group worked with previous collaborators Sean Garrett, Polow da Don and Timbaland and new ones such as Darkchild, J-Roc and Chase N. Cashe. Polow da Don, R. Kelly and Snoop Dogg also make guest performances on the album. Several songs on Doll Domination were originally recorded for the lead singer Nicole Scherzinger's debut solo album, Her Name is Nicole, which was shelved after the under-performance of its preceding singles.\nThe album consists of a mixture of pop and R&B songs that also blend elements of dance, electropop with lyrics that tackle fame, sexuality and relationships. All of the lead and background vocals were sung by Scherzinger with support from Melody Thornton, whilst the remaining group members are only credited for background vocals. Upon release, Doll Domination received mixed reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 becoming the group's highest charting album. It experienced similar peaks in international territories, debuting at number three in Canada and number four in Australia and the United Kingdom. Doll Domination was later reissued in multiple versions throughout 2009. The album was supported with a world tour titled Doll Domination Tour in 2009.\nThe album was preceded by the release of the US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten single \"When I Grow Up\" and the UK top-ten hit \"Whatcha Think About That\" (featuring Missy Elliott). Other successful singles were \"I Hate This Part\", \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\", and \"Hush Hush; Hush Hush\", all of which reached the top ten in numerous countries worldwide. Although \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\" became a number-one hit in Australia, Ireland, Finland, among other countries, the single caused tension within the group as Scherzinger was billed as a featured artist. Despite their commercial success, unhappiness of Scherzinger's spotlight and prominence within the group grew leading to a public outburst by Thornton during the tour. In early 2010, the group disbanded to pursue solo projects, before reforming in 2019 with the promise of new music. In 2019, the R. Kelly collaboration \"Out of This Club\" was removed from digital retailers and streaming services, following the airing of the Surviving R.

He then made the cross-county transition to Broadway, appearing in Kid Boots (1923), the Ziegfeld Follies of 1924, Ziegfeld Follies of 1925, and Good News (1927).George Olsen and his orchestra were in Eddie Cantor's 1928 Broadway hit Whoopee!, and in the 1930 movie version. In the Follies George met a singer, Ethel Shutta, who sings and dances memorably in Whoopee!, and they married, appearing together in nightclubs and on radio. They had two children, George Jr. and Charles; following a divorce, Olsen opened a restaurant in Paramus, New Jersey. Olsen and Shutta were heard on the Oldsmobile Program on CBS radio in 1933. He also was an orchestra leader for The Jack Benny Program on radio.\nOlsen signed with Victor in 1924 and remained as one of Victor's most popular bands until 1933 when he signed with Columbia. He stayed with Columbia through January, 1934. He recorded a single session in 1938 for Decca, and one final date for the rare Varsity label in 1940.\nOlsen's bands produced few stars. Singer-saxophonist Fred MacMurray passed through in 1930 on his way to eventual movie stardom, recording a vocal on I'm in the Market for You. Olsen's long-time alto saxist and singer, Fran Frey, with his distinctive, reedy bass-baritone, was perhaps the best known Olsenite until he left in 1933 for a career as a music director in radio.\nIn 1936, Olsen became leader of Orville Knapp's band after Knapp died in a plane crash. Olsen was chosen to lead the band by Knapp's widow. Morale problems plagued the group, and in 1938, after many musicians had already left, the group disbanded.\nA resident of Paramus, New Jersey, Olsen ran a popular local restaurant there on Paramus Road for many years before he died there on March 18, 1971. According to John S. Wilson in The New York Times, reviewing a retrospective of Olsen's recording \"George Olsen and His Music\" on RCA-Victor, in 1968, Olsen had a restaurant in Paramus, New Jersey, called \"George Olsen's\". Wilson noted that \"Olsen is there every day greeting guests at lunch and dinner...

Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released in February 1979 in the United States by Capricorn Records and PolyGram Records elsewhere. The Allman Brothers Band had broken up in 1976 following internal turmoil, amplified by escalating drug use. The band members splintered into different acts \u2014 among those Great Southern, Sea Level, and the Gregg Allman Band. Guitarist Dickey Betts approached his bandmates in 1978 with the prospects of a reunion. It is the first to feature guitarist Dan Toler and bassist David Goldflies. Living together in Sarasota, Florida, they rehearsed and wrote the material for their next album in fall 1978.\nThey began recording Enlightened Rogues that December, and recording stretched into the new year. Sessions took place in Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, with producer Tom Dowd, who worked on a trio of early Allman Brothers albums. The group stayed at a home overlooking Biscayne Bay, which promoted unity within the members. The recording process was smooth and pleasant, with members showing courtesy to one another in comparison to ill feelings felt earlier. The album's title comes from a quote original guitarist Duane Allman used to describe the band: \"The world is made of two great schools, enlightened rogues and religious fools.\"\nThe album was a commercial success in the United States, peaking at #9 and earning a RIAA gold certification. \"Crazy Love\" was the group's second of three Top 40 hits, reaching #29.

Although the band was not initially successful, they quickly earned a dedicated cult following and have been retrospectively praised for their pioneering innovation in several genres related to folk music. They also proved to be influential, both during their initial run and to a new generation of musicians like Yo La Tengo and Espers.As the Holy Modal Rounders, Stampfel and Weber began playing in Greenwich Village, at the heart of the ongoing American folk music revival. Their sense of humor, irreverent attitude, and novel update of old-time music brought support from fellow musicians but also caused controversy amongst folk purists in the scene. In 1964, the Rounders made history with their self-titled debut, which included the first use of \"psychedelic\" in popular music. After their first two studio albums, the duo briefly joined the newly formed underground rock band the Fugs in 1965 and helped record the band's influential debut album. \nFollowing their exit from the Fugs, the duo released two albums that experimented with psychedelic folk before they expanded their lineup to a full rock band by the end of 1968. The Holy Modal Rounders' expanded lineup notably included famed playwright Sam Shepard as a drummer and later guitarist Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter (amongst others) before stabilizing in 1971, with a band that would later back Jeffrey Frederick as the Clamtones. In 1972, Weber relocated the band to Portland, Oregon, while Stampfel stayed behind in New York. Although Stampfel would describe Weber as his \"long lost brother,\" they often had a hostile relationship and the two would only reunite sporadically following the band's Portland move. After Weber returned to the East Coast in 1995, the duo began a series of concert reunions starting in 1996 before breaking up for the last time in 2003.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Since then, Brothers Osborne have released the albums Port Saint Joe (2018), Skeletons (2020), and Brothers Osborne (2023).\nThe duo have since had further hits with \"It Ain't My Fault\" (2017), \"Shoot Me Straight\" (2018), and \"All Night\" (2019), and as featured artists on Dierks Bentley's \"Burning Man\" (2019). Along with their own songwriting, their musical success is credited to producer Jay Joyce. Artists with whom they have worked include David Nail, Lee Ann Womack, and Lucie Silvas (the latter of whom is John's wife). Their musical style takes influence from Southern rock and outlaw country, with particular emphasis on the styles of T.J.'s lead vocals and John's guitar playing. The duo attracted further media attention in February 2021 when T.J. came out as gay, making him the first openly gay artist on a major country music label.", "hasanswer": true}]}
