Simpson also highlighted the distinction between tempo and mode. \"Tempo\" encompasses \"evolutionary rates \u2026 their acceleration and deceleration, the conditions of exceptionally slow or rapid evolutions, and phenomena suggestive of inertia and momentum,\" while \"mode\" embraces \"the study of the way, manner, or pattern of evolution, a study in which tempo is a basic factor, but which embraces considerably more than tempo.\"\nSimpson's Tempo and Mode attempted to draw out several distinct generalizations:\n\nEvolution's tempo can impart information about its mode.\nMultiple tempos can be found in the fossil record: horotelic (medium tempo), bradytelic (slow tempo), and tachytelic (rapid tempo).\nThe facts of paleontology are consistent with the genetical theory of natural selection. Moreover, theories such as orthogenesis, Lamarckism, mutation pressures, and macromutations either are false or play little to no role.\nMost evolution\u2014\"nine-tenths\"\u2014occurs by the steady phyletic transformation of whole lineages (anagenesis). This contrasts with Ernst Mayr's interpretation of speciation by splitting, particularly  allopatric and peripatric speciation.\nThe lack of evidence for evolutionary transitions in the fossil record is best accounted for, first, by the poorness of the geological record, and, second, as a consequence of quantum evolution (which is responsible for \"the origin of taxonomic units of relatively high rank, such as families, orders, and classes\"). Quantum evolution built upon Sewall Wright's theory of random genetic drift.Tempo and Mode earned Simpson the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1944. Fifty years after its publication, the National Academy of Sciences commissioned a book entitled Tempo and Mode in Evolution: Genetics and Paleontology 50 Years After Simpson edited by Walter M.

Buddhist tradition holds he died in Kushinagar and reached parinirvana, final extinction.According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and severe asceticism, leading to freedom from ignorance, craving, rebirth, and suffering. His core teachings are summarized in the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, a training of the mind that includes ethical training and kindness toward others, and meditative practices such as sense restraint, mindfulness, dhyana (meditation proper) and the concept of dependent origination, emphasizing the impermanent and interconnected nature of all things. \nAbout two centuries after his death, he came to be known by the title Buddha; his teachings were compiled by the Buddhist community in the Vinaya, his codes for monastic practice, and the Sutta Pi\u1e6daka, a compilation of teachings based on his discourses. These were passed down in Middle Indo-Aryan dialects through an oral tradition. Later generations composed additional texts, such as systematic treatises known as Abhidharma, biographies of the Buddha, collections of stories about his past lives known as Jataka tales, and additional discourses, i.e., the Mahayana sutras.Buddhism spread beyond the Indian subcontinent, evolving into a variety of traditions and practices.

The book is Peacock's most well-liked and frequently-read work.The novel was a topical work of Gothic fiction in which the author satirised tendencies in contemporary English literature, in particular Romanticism's obsession with morbid subjects, misanthropy and transcendental philosophical systems. Most of its characters are based on historical figures whom Peacock wished to pillory.It has been observed that \"the plots of Peacock's novels are mostly devices for bringing the persons together and the persons are merely the embodiment of whims and theories, or types of a class\". Nightmare Abbey embodies the critique of a particular mentality and pillories the contemporary vogue for the macabre. To his friend Percy Bysshe Shelley, Peacock described the object of his novel as being \"to bring to a sort of philosophical focus a few of the morbidities of modern literature\". Appearing in the same year as Northanger Abbey, it similarly contrasts the product of the inflamed imagination, or what Peacock's Mr Hilary describes as the \"conspiracy against cheerfulness\", with the commonplace course of everyday life, with the aid of light-hearted ridicule.Several of the chapters take a dramatic form interspersed with stage directions in order to illustrate without comment how much the speakers characterise themselves through their conversation.

The poem uses the conceit of a flea, which has sucked blood from the male speaker and his female lover, to serve as an extended metaphor for the relationship between them. The speaker tries to convince a lady to sleep with him, arguing that if their blood mingling in the flea is innocent, then sexual mingling would also be innocent. His argument hinges on the belief that bodily fluids mix during sexual intercourse.According to Laurence Perrine, this poem, along with many other of Donne's poems, solidifies his place in the literary movement, creating what is now known as metaphysical poetry.

Events such as the Uruguayan military coup forced Galeano into exile in Spain and Argentina; these exiles, in particular, may have been formative in Galeano's life and writing. The ruminations of this book were formed as a result of Galeano's desire to remember the past traumas and as well as to learn from them. Within this piece of nonfiction, he explores themes such as modern education systems, racism, sexism, poverty, economics, work, and societal fear. The pretense of the prose tends to be preoccupied with learning to rethink the contradictions of society; in a moment when outrageous circumstances are normalized, it is time to reconsider the understandings many people hold, which, in turn, informs the way such people view things.

A libertarian socialist, Chomsky is a prominent critic of capitalism, the role of western media and the foreign policy of the U.S. government, dealing with such issues in bestsellers like Manufacturing Consent (1988), Hegemony or Survival (2003) and Failed States (2006). With the birth of the Occupy Movement \u2013 devoted to socio-political change \u2013 in 2011, Chomsky became a vocal supporter for the protesters, writing articles and giving speeches on their behalf, several of which were collected together and published as Occupy.\nThe book opens with an introductory editor's note by Greg Ruggiero, praising the Occupy movement and its potential for the greater democratization of society. This is followed by the text to Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, which he gave at Occupy Boston in Massachusetts. The third part of the book comprises Chomsky's interview with the New York University student Edward Radzivilovskiy, while the fourth contains the text of the InterOccupy conference call with Chomsky by Mikal Kamil and Ian Escuela. Part five offers an interview with Chomsky undertaken at the University of Maryland, while the book is rounded off by Chomsky's tribute to the late activist Howard Zinn and the National Lawyers Guild's legal advice to Occupy protesters.\nThroughout the book, Chomsky discusses what the Occupy movement is and what it is demanding, as well as advocating ways in which it could gain greater support and achieve governmental reforms, using historical examples as evidence.

Politically, Chomsky had held radical leftist views since childhood, identifying himself with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism. He is particularly known for his critiques of U.S. foreign policy and contemporary capitalism, and he has been described as a prominent cultural figure.\nFirst emerging in New York City in 2011, the Occupy movement was an international protest movement against social and economic inequality, its primary goal being to make the economic structure and power relations in society more favorable to the underclasses. Different local groups have different foci, but among the prime concerns is the claim that large corporations and the global financial system control the world in a way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy and is unstable. It was widely seen as a reaction to the 2008\u20132012 global recession, an economic crisis that had led to high unemployment across the western world, and was also inspired by the Arab Spring, in which popular protest movements overthrew the governments of several countries in the Arab world.

The identity of this young patron, who is likely the \"Mr. W.H.\" to whom Shakespeare dedicated the sonnets, is considered by many historians and Shakespearean analysts to be Henry Wriothesley, third Earl of Southampton. Martin Green supports this hypothesis with the evidence that Shakespeare never wrote dedications in of his works to any person besides Wriothesley. Shakespeare's relationship with this young man as interpreted from this group of sonnets is not entirely clear; his words of love and affection could be a bid for more favor, or as Judith Kegan Gardiner maintains, a true love that surprised and startled Shakespeare. Even if Shakespeare's sonnets are accepted as an expression of genuine love, there is still no consensus in academia whether this love was sexual in nature.

Vronsky's central contention is that female serial killers, while exhibiting different forensic 'signatures' from male counterparts, inevitably kill for the same reasons that male offenders do: for power and control. The major difference, according to Vronsky, between female and male serial killers is that females (unless partnered with a male offender) tend not to sexually assault or physically mutilate their victims.Vronsky cites statistics indicating that nearly one in six (16 percent) of serial killers apprehended in the United States since 1820 was a female, either acting alone or as a partner of a male or female offender. Vronsky argues that, contrary to popular belief, female serial killers prefer to murder their male intimates or family members, while recent data indicate that currently female serial killers marginally prefer strangers as victims and that historically in the United States, 53 percent of female serial killers had murdered at least one adult female, and 32 percent at least one female child.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_12684", "text": "Fox Evil is a novel by British crime-writer Minette Walters.

It was published in two cycles, in 1848 and in 1860. The poem describes the events of the Finnish War (1808\u20131809) in which Sweden lost its eastern territories; these would become incorporated into the Russian Empire as the Grand Duchy of Finland.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_11383", "text": "The first part of Ensign St\u00e5l was first published in the revolutionary year 1848, the second in 1860. It shaped Finnish identity and was later given out free during the Winter War to raise patriotic spirit. The first chapter of the poem also became the national anthem of Finland.The name of the title character, \"St\u00e5l\", is Swedish for steel, a typical example of a so-called \"soldier's name\". These were names, often consisting of simple words for traits or traits related to the military or nature, given to Swedish soldiers by their commanders, and many of Runeberg's characters have them: Dufva, Sv\u00e4rd and Hurtig ('pigeon', 'sword' and 'quick') are other examples\nThe poems of Ensign St\u00e5l feature several officers who fought in the Finnish War, including marshals Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor and Johan August Sandels, generals Carl Nathanael af Klercker, Carl Johan Adlercreutz, and Georg Carl von D\u00f6beln, and Colonel Otto von Fieandt.The influence of Tales of Ensign St\u00e5l is also remarkable to Finnish culture because it repeatedly lifts the common people as heroes, despite the hardship of their life. The poem \"Soldatgossen\" (\"Boy soldier\") is one that exalts the military virtues and which has been a major influence in the shaping of the legend and myth of the Finnish soldier. The narrator is a young boy, who relates the story of his family, all soldiers. They have respectively all died in the wars of Finland, fighting for their King and country. The boy is now orphan \"eating stranger's bread\", but he is proud  of his military legacy. He cites with pride that his father was \"only fifteen\" when he joined the ranks. He says he was only a child when his father left, subsequently to be killed in the War of Finland's Lapua battle, but he remembers his fine shape, for he was \"fair, too\" his proud posture and the plume of this hat. There is a sense of tragedy in the poem, for the boy cannot wait to join himself; he says he wants to go \"where the bullets sing hardest, where the fire fulminates\". Moreover, he states he cannot not go there, there is an inner compulsion to follow the road marked by his forefathers. Such is the power of the poem it has been accused of rank militarism and glorifying of war, perhaps not without reason. But it is also a fine description of the ideals and mentality of the time: it was acceptable to the Swedes to recruit even fifteen-year olds to war and such tasks were glorified in society. The boy states that his father's road \"always led to honor\", and that he \"gladly suffered cold, hunger and his wounds\", the epitome of military resilience. It gives us a flashback to the way of thinking of the past military ideals. Whether any soldier gladly suffers cold, hunger and wounds is another matter: this is what was expected of them. That even a young boy unquestioningly chooses that road tells us perhaps  the lack of avenues available in that society: the shame of \"eating stranger's bread\" i.e. being subject to charity, can only be wiped out by following in his father's footsteps and dying, at least fighting, for his country. He says:\"I'm a hero's son, I shall not go to waste.\" So, even a poor military orphan boy can achieve transcendence and honor, when officers \u2013 at least some of them \u2013 totally lose their honor. The concept of military honor is strong in Tales of Ensign St\u00e5hl, but it is often found in surprising persons, often persons of lower rank, such as the intellectually disabled Sven Dufva, or in unarmed governor, or in munitions provider Lotta Sv\u00e4rd. As such, this was important to the development of the national feeling, for the common people were seen as worthy, sometimes even worthier than the upper class.\nThe personage of Lotta Sv\u00e4rd and the Soldier boy poem, when composed to music, were later taken up by defence organisations as their symbols.\nAmong the most famous characters is the simple but heroic rotesoldat Sven Dufva. The organisations Lotta Sv\u00e4rd and the Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Organization (\"Lottorna\") were named after the character in the poem of the same name.From its publication to the mid-twentieth Century, The Tales of Ensign St\u00e5l was staple reading in both Finnish and Swedish schools. It shaped the later image of the war and of some of its real-life protagonists. Admiral Carl Olof Cronstedt is mainly remembered today for his treacherous surrender of the fortress of Sveaborg. The Russian general Yakov Kulnev, on the other hand, is described positively as a chivalrous and brave soldier and ladies' man.\nEnsign St\u00e5l was translated into Finnish by a group led by fennoman professor Julius Krohn in 1867. Later translations were made by Paavo Cajander in 1889 and Otto Manninen 1909. Albert Edelfelt drew the illustrations between 1894 and 1900. Due to the dated language, a new translation was issued in 2007.

Morris proposed the idea to several Fleet Street publishers, with little success, until Hulton Press took it on.\nFollowing a huge publicity campaign, the first issue of Eagle was released in April 1950.

Girl was followed in 1953 by Robin, which was aimed at younger children, and in March 1954 by Swift, for older readers than Robin but younger than Eagle or Girl.\nThe popularity of comics which depicted war faded after the end of the Second World War, and Eagle's previously unheard-of circulation figures helped define the content of most comics produced during the 1950s, including war. In contrast to other, earlier publications, Eagle attempted to educate the reader with factual, text-based historical stories, such as the life of Winston Churchill, as presented in \"The Happy Warrior\". A detailed account of the Second World War was given, while one strip lambasted German paratroopers, who on seeing British infantry below them, shouted \"Donner und Blitzen! Der Englander!\" During the mid-1950s however, comics began sensationalising their covers with war imagery, and Eagle followed suit in the 1960s.Morris went on to become editorial director of the National Magazine Company, and later its managing director and editor-in-chief. He launched Cosmopolitan in the UK, and with Cond\u00e9 Nast he formed COMAG, one of the UK's largest media distribution companies. He was appointed OBE in 1983, retired the following year, and died in March 1989. Despite his later work however, he is best remembered as the founder of Eagle. His memorial service at St Bride's Church in Fleet Street was filled to overflowing.\n\nHampson was embittered by his departure from Eagle. Although he created Dan Dare, he and Morris had signed contracts which made the space adventurer the copyright of its publisher. This made it difficult for him to get hold of his original artwork, and excluded him from any profits Hulton made from the huge range of Dan Dare and Eagle merchandise it licensed. He called Odhams, the comic's owner after 1960, \"Treens\". Hampson later worked on various advertising commissions, and illustrated seven Ladybird books. He recovered from cancer to become a graphics technician at Ewell Technical College, and in 1975 at the Lucca comics convention was declared as the best writer and illustrator of strip cartoons since the end of the Second World War. At the 1976 Comics 101 British comics convention he was given the Ally Sloper Award, as the best British strip cartoon artist. He died at Epsom in July 1985. His original Dan Dare drawings now command high prices, and have inspired a range of modern artists.Gerald Scarfe and David Hockney were first published in Eagle. X-Men comic scriptwriter Chris Claremont read and enjoyed Eagle, and cites Hampson's work as influential on his career. Watchmen co-creator Dave Gibbons has also praised Hampson's work, and the lyricist Tim Rice, in his foreword to Living with Eagles (1998), cites the stories printed in Eagle as helping \"me in my story-telling efforts through musicals many years on\". Professor Stephen Hawking, when asked about the influence Dan Dare had on him, replied: \"Why am I in cosmology?\", and the entertainer Kenny Everett chose an Eagle Annual as his book on Desert Island Discs.The comic industry's Eagle Awards, first presented in 1977, are named after Eagle, and a fan club, the Eagle Society, regularly publishes the quarterly Eagle Times.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The date of 1804 on the title page is probably when the plates were begun, but the poem was printed c.\u20091808. Today it is best known as the hymn \"Jerusalem\", with music written by Sir Hubert Parry in 1916. The famous orchestration was written by Sir Edward Elgar. It is not to be confused with another poem, much longer and larger in scope and also by Blake, called Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion.\nIt is often assumed that the poem was inspired by the apocryphal story that a young Jesus, accompanied by Joseph of Arimathea, a tin merchant, travelled to what is now England and visited Glastonbury during his unknown years. However, according to British folklore scholar A. W. Smith, \"there was little reason to believe that an oral tradition concerning a visit made by Jesus to Britain existed before the early part of the twentieth century\". Instead, the poem draws on an older story, repeated in Milton's History of Britain, that Joseph of Arimathea, alone, travelled to preach to the ancient Britons after the death of Jesus. The poem's theme is linked to the Book of Revelation (3:12 and 21:2) describing a Second Coming, wherein Jesus establishes a New Jerusalem. Churches in general, and the Church of England in particular, have long used Jerusalem as a metaphor for Heaven, a place of universal love and peace.In the most common interpretation of the poem, Blake asks whether a visit by Jesus briefly created heaven in England, in contrast to the \"dark Satanic Mills\" of the Industrial Revolution. Blake's poem asks four questions rather than asserting the historical truth of Christ's visit. The second verse is interpreted as an exhortation to create an ideal society in England, whether or not there was a divine visit.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Warner Modular's publisher, Claude McCaleb, had spent his career publishing books for universities, and CRV was planned as part of a series of works that studied American institutions, which McCaleb believed would be timely after the Watergate scandal. Warner Modular had prepared ads to run in various periodicals that promoted CRV, in anticipation of an upcoming convention of the American Sociological Association in New York City.  \nAccording to McCaleb, in an affidavit to Chomsky and Herman quoted in Ben Bagdikian's The Media Monopoly, on August 27, 1973, the chief of book operations at Warner Communications, William Sarnoff, nephew of David Sarnoff, saw the ads come across his desk and called McCaleb's office in Andover, Massachusetts and Sarnoff asked if CRV would be another Pentagon Papers that would embarrass Warner.

Two hours later, Sarnoff called again and asked McCaleb to fly that night and bring an advance copy of the book to his office in New York City.

The first novelisation of an unfilmed James Bond screenplay, it was born from a collaboration by five people: Ian Fleming, Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, Ivar Bryce and Ernest Cuneo, although the controversial shared credit of Fleming, McClory and Whittingham was the result of a courtroom decision.\nThe story centres on the theft of a pair of nuclear weapons by the crime syndicate SPECTRE and the subsequent attempted blackmail of the Western powers for their return. James Bond, Secret Service operative 007, travels to the Bahamas to work with his friend Felix Leiter, seconded back into the CIA for the investigation. Thunderball also introduces SPECTRE's leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld, in the first of three appearances in Bond novels, with On Her Majesty's Secret Service and You Only Live Twice being the others.\nThunderball has been adapted four times, once in a comic strip format for the Daily Express newspaper, twice for the cinema and once for the radio. The Daily Express strip was cut short on the order of its owner, Lord Beaverbrook, after Ian Fleming signed an agreement with The Sunday Times to publish a short story.

Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came through, while his incapacity, suffered in Live and Let Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene towards the end of the novel.Academic Christoph Linder sees Thunderball as part of the second wave of Bond villains: the first wave consisted of SMERSH, the second of Blofeld and SPECTRE, undertaken because of the thawing of relations between East and West, although the cold war escalated again shortly afterwards, with the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the construction of the Berlin Wall and the Cuban Missile Crisis all occurring in an eighteen-month period from April 1961 to November 1962. The introduction of SPECTRE and its use over several books gives a measure of continuity to the remaining stories in the series, according to academic Jeremy Black. Black argues that SPECTRE represents \"evil unconstrained by ideology\" and it partly came about because the decline of the British Empire led to a lack of certainty in Fleming's mind.

Schoolcraft seems to have been inconsistent in his pursuit of authenticity, as he rewrote and censored sources. The folklorist Stith Thompson, although crediting Schoolcraft's research with being a \"landmark,\" was quite critical of him: \"Unfortunately, the scientific value of his work is marred by the manner in which he has reshaped the stories to fit his own literary taste.\" In addition to Longfellow\u2019s own annotations, Stellanova Osborn (and previously F. Broilo in German) tracked down \"chapter and verse\" for every detail Longfellow took from Schoolcraft. Others have identified words from native languages included in the poem.\nIntentionally epic in scope, The Song of Hiawatha was described by its author as \"this Indian Edda\". But Thompson judged that despite Longfellow's claimed \"chapter and verse\" citations, the work \"produce[s] a unity the original will not warrant,\" i.e., it is non-Indian in its totality. Thompson found close parallels in plot between the poem and its sources, with the major exception that Longfellow took legends told about multiple characters and substituted the character Hiawatha as the protagonist of them all. Resemblances between the original stories, as \"reshaped by Schoolcraft,\" and the episodes in the poem are but superficial, and Longfellow omits important details essential to Ojibwe narrative construction, characterization, and theme. This is the case even with \"Hiawatha\u2019s Fishing,\" the episode closest to its source. Some important parts of the poem were more or less Longfellow's invention from fragments or his imagination. \"The courtship of Hiawatha and Minnehaha, the least 'Indian' of any of the events in Hiawatha, has come for many readers to stand as the typical American Indian tale.\" Also, \"in exercising the function of selecting incidents to make an artistic production, Longfellow ... omitted all that aspect of the Manabozho saga which considers the culture hero as a trickster,\" this despite the fact that Schoolcraft had already diligently avoided what he himself called \"vulgarisms.\"In his book on the development of the image of the Indian in American thought and literature, Pearce wrote about The Song of Hiawatha:\n\nIt was Longfellow who fully realized for mid-nineteenth century Americans the possibility of [the] image of the noble savage.  He had available to him not only [previous examples of] poems on the Indian ... but also the general feeling that the Indian belonged nowhere in American life but in dim prehistory. He saw how the mass of Indian legends which Schoolcraft was collecting depicted noble savages out of time, and offered, if treated right, a kind of primitive example of that very progress which had done them in.  Thus in Hiawatha he was able, matching legend with a sentimental view of a past far enough away in time to be safe and near enough in space to be appealing, fully to image the Indian as noble savage.  For by the time Longfellow wrote Hiawatha, the Indian as a direct opponent of civilization was dead, yet was still heavy on American consciences ... The tone of the legend and ballad ... would color the noble savage so as to make him blend in with a dim and satisfying past about which readers could have dim and satisfying feelings.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "484_11594", "text": "The Song of Hiawatha is an 1855 epic poem in trochaic tetrameter by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow which features Native American characters. The epic relates the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman. Events in the story are set in the Pictured Rocks area of Michigan on the south shore of Lake Superior. Longfellow's poem is based on oral traditions surrounding the figure of Manabozho, but it also contains his own innovations.\nLongfellow drew some of his material from his friendship with Ojibwe Chief Kahge-ga-gah-bowh, who would visit at Longfellow's home. He also had frequent encounters with Black Hawk and other Sauk people on Boston Common, and he drew from Algic Researches (1839) and other writings by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, an ethnographer and United States Indian agent, and from Heckewelder's Narratives.  In sentiment, scope, overall conception, and many particulars, Longfellow insisted, \"I can give chapter and verse for these legends. Their chief value is that they are Indian legends.\"Longfellow had originally planned on following Schoolcraft in calling his hero Manabozho, the name in use at the time among the Ojibwe of the south shore of Lake Superior for a figure of their folklore who was a trickster and transformer. But he wrote in his journal entry for June 28, 1854: \"Work at 'Manabozho;' or, as I think I shall call it, 'Hiawatha'\u2014that being another name for the same personage.\" Longfellow was following Schoolcraft, but he was mistaken in thinking that the names were synonymous. The name Hiawatha is derived from a historical figure associated with the League of the Iroquois, then located in New York and Pennsylvania.

Harriet Monroe, a fellow resident of Chicago, had founded the magazine Poetry in 1912.  Monroe liked and encouraged Sandburg's plain-speaking free verse style, strongly reminiscent of Walt Whitman.  Chicago Poems established Sandburg as a major figure in contemporary literature.Sandburg has described the poem as\na chant of defiance by Chicago... its defiance of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, London, Paris, Berlin and Rome.

John 21:24 claims that the Gospel of John is based on the written testimony of the \"Beloved Disciple\". The authorship of some Johannine literature has been debated since about the year 200.In his 4th century Ecclesiastical History, Eusebius says that the First Epistle of John and the Gospel of John are widely agreed upon as his. However, Eusebius mentions that the consensus is that the second and third epistles of John are not his but were written by some other John. Eusebius also goes to some length to establish with the reader that there is no general consensus regarding the revelation of John. The revelation of John could only be what is now called the Book of Revelation. The Gospel according to John differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, which were likely written decades earlier. The bishops of Asia Minor supposedly requested him to write his gospel to deal with the heresy of the Ebionites, who asserted that Christ did not exist before Mary. John probably knew of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, but these gospels spoke of Jesus primarily in the year following the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist. Around 600, however, Sophronius of Jerusalem noted that \"two epistles bearing his name ... are considered by some to be the work of a certain John the Elder\" and, while stating that Revelation was written by John of Patmos, it was \"later translated by Justin Martyr and Irenaeus,\" presumably in an attempt to reconcile tradition with the obvious differences in Greek style.\nUntil the 19th century, the authorship of the Gospel of John had been attributed to the Apostle John. However, most modern critical scholars have their doubts. Some scholars place the Gospel of John somewhere between AD 65 and 85; John Robinson proposes an initial edition by 50\u201355 and then a final edition by 65 due to narrative similarities with Paul.:\u200app.284,\u200a307\u200a Other scholars are of the opinion that the Gospel of John was composed in two or three stages.:\u200ap.43\u200a Most contemporary scholars consider that the Gospel was not written until the latter third of the first century AD, and with the earliest possible date of AD 75\u201380: \"...a date of AD 75\u201380 as the earliest possible date of composition for this Gospel.\" Other scholars think that an even later date, perhaps even the last decade of the first century AD right up to the start of the 2nd century (i.e. 90 \u2013 100), is applicable.Nonetheless, today many theological scholars continue to accept the traditional authorship. Colin G. Kruse states that since John the Evangelist has been named consistently in the writings of early Church Fathers, \"it is hard to pass by this conclusion, despite widespread reluctance to accept it by many, but by no means all, modern scholars.\"Modern, mainstream Bible scholars generally assert that the Gospel of John has been  written by an anonymous author.Regarding whether the author of the Gospel of John was an eyewitness, according to Paul N. Anderson, the gospel \"contains more direct claims to eyewitness origins than any of the other Gospel traditions.\" F. F. Bruce argues that 19:35 contains an \"emphatic and explicit claim to eyewitness authority.\" The gospel nowhere claims to have been written by direct witnesses to the reported events.Mainstream Bible scholars assert that all four gospels from the New Testament are fundamentally anonymous and most of mainstream scholars agree that these gospels have not been written by eyewitnesses.

Generally listed as the youngest apostle, he was the son of Zebedee and Salome. His brother James was another of the Twelve Apostles. The Church Fathers identify him as John the Evangelist, John of Patmos, John the Elder, and the Beloved Disciple, and testify that he outlived the remaining apostles and was the only one to die of natural causes, although modern scholars are divided on the veracity of these claims. \n\nJohn the Apostle is traditionally held to be the author of the Gospel of John, and many Christian denominations believe that he authored several other books of the New Testament (the three Johannine epistles and the Book of Revelation, together with the Gospel of John, are called the Johannine works), depending on whether he is distinguished from, or identified with, John the Evangelist, John the Elder, and John of Patmos.\nAlthough the authorship of the Johannine works has traditionally been attributed to John the Apostle, only a minority of contemporary scholars believe he wrote the gospel, and most conclude that he wrote none of them. Regardless of whether or not John the Apostle wrote any of the Johannine works, most scholars agree that all three epistles were written by the same author and that the epistles did not have the same author as the Book of Revelation, although there is widespread disagreement among scholars as to whether the author of the epistles was different from that of the gospel.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was founded by Marcus Morris, an Anglican vicar from Lancashire. Morris edited a Southport parish magazine called The Anvil, but felt that the church was not communicating its message effectively. Simultaneously disillusioned with contemporary children's literature, he and Anvil artist Frank Hampson created a dummy comic based on Christian values. Morris proposed the idea to several Fleet Street publishers, with little success, until Hulton Press took it on.\nFollowing a huge publicity campaign, the first issue of Eagle was released in April 1950. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, created by Hampson with meticulous attention to detail. Other popular stories included Riders of the Range and P.C. 49. Eagle also contained news and sport sections, and educational cutaway diagrams of sophisticated machinery. A members club was created, and a range of related merchandise was licensed for sale.\nAmidst a takeover of the periodical's publisher and a series of acrimonious disputes, Morris left in 1959; Hampson followed shortly thereafter. Although Eagle continued in various forms, a perceived lowering of editorial standards preceded plummeting sales, and it was eventually subsumed by its rival, Lion, in 1969. Eagle was relaunched in 1982 and ran for over 500 issues before being dropped by its publisher in 1994.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "484_12048", "text": "Eagles of the Empire is a series of historical military fiction novels written by Simon Scarrow. The series began in July 2000 with the publication of Under the Eagle, and as of March 2022 there have been 21 novels released in the series, with the 22nd novel due in November 2023.Eagles of the Empire takes place within the Roman Empire, beginning in AD 42 during the reign of Emperor Claudius. The books follow the lives of two officers in the Imperial Roman army, Quintus Licinius Cato and Lucius Cornelius Macro. The first book introduces Cato to the Roman army and then follows the development of the friendship and careers of the two soldiers. The series also features many historical figures and interweaves them into the fictional plots influenced by historical events. The characters Cato and Macro were additionally used in one book of the TimeRiders series, Gates of Rome (2012), where they served as supporting characters when the three protagonists travel back to Ancient Rome. Scarrow allowed his brother Alex to make use of the characters in his own novel.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_11418", "text": "Eagle inspired several imitators, such as Valiant, Tiger, and Lion (which featured a Dan Dare clone, \"Captain Condor\") but such adventure tales were less palatable for girls. Female characters like Dan Dare's Professor Peabody (one of only two female main characters in the strip), were generally given less important roles than the men, and as a result a trend developed toward producing comics aimed specifically at either boys or girls. Girl, a sister title to Eagle, appeared in November 1951, and featured youthful capers in boarding schools, and tales of equestrian adventure. Later comics such as Jackie, descended from contemporary women's magazines, were more cosmopolitan in flavour. Girl was followed in 1953 by Robin, which was aimed at younger children, and in March 1954 by Swift, for older readers than Robin but younger than Eagle or Girl.\nThe popularity of comics which depicted war faded after the end of the Second World War, and Eagle's previously unheard-of circulation figures helped define the content of most comics produced during the 1950s, including war. In contrast to other, earlier publications, Eagle attempted to educate the reader with factual, text-based historical stories, such as the life of Winston Churchill, as presented in \"The Happy Warrior\". A detailed account of the Second World War was given, while one strip lambasted German paratroopers, who on seeing British infantry below them, shouted \"Donner und Blitzen! Der Englander!\" During the mid-1950s however, comics began sensationalising their covers with war imagery, and Eagle followed suit in the 1960s.Morris went on to become editorial director of the National Magazine Company, and later its managing director and editor-in-chief. He launched Cosmopolitan in the UK, and with Cond\u00e9 Nast he formed COMAG, one of the UK's largest media distribution companies. He was appointed OBE in 1983, retired the following year, and died in March 1989. Despite his later work however, he is best remembered as the founder of Eagle. His memorial service at St Bride's Church in Fleet Street was filled to overflowing.\n\nHampson was embittered by his departure from Eagle. Although he created Dan Dare, he and Morris had signed contracts which made the space adventurer the copyright of its publisher. This made it difficult for him to get hold of his original artwork, and excluded him from any profits Hulton made from the huge range of Dan Dare and Eagle merchandise it licensed. He called Odhams, the comic's owner after 1960, \"Treens\". Hampson later worked on various advertising commissions, and illustrated seven Ladybird books. He recovered from cancer to become a graphics technician at Ewell Technical College, and in 1975 at the Lucca comics convention was declared as the best writer and illustrator of strip cartoons since the end of the Second World War. At the 1976 Comics 101 British comics convention he was given the Ally Sloper Award, as the best British strip cartoon artist. He died at Epsom in July 1985. His original Dan Dare drawings now command high prices, and have inspired a range of modern artists.Gerald Scarfe and David Hockney were first published in Eagle. X-Men comic scriptwriter Chris Claremont read and enjoyed Eagle, and cites Hampson's work as influential on his career. Watchmen co-creator Dave Gibbons has also praised Hampson's work, and the lyricist Tim Rice, in his foreword to Living with Eagles (1998), cites the stories printed in Eagle as helping \"me in my story-telling efforts through musicals many years on\". Professor Stephen Hawking, when asked about the influence Dan Dare had on him, replied: \"Why am I in cosmology?\", and the entertainer Kenny Everett chose an Eagle Annual as his book on Desert Island Discs.The comic industry's Eagle Awards, first presented in 1977, are named after Eagle, and a fan club, the Eagle Society, regularly publishes the quarterly Eagle Times.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As a response to these problems encountered within the Standard Theory, a new approach called the generative semantics (as opposed to the interpretive semantics in Aspects) was invented in the early 1970s by some of Chomsky's collaborators (notably George Lakoff), and was incorporated later in the late 1980s into what is now known as the school of cognitive linguistics, at odds with Chomskyan school of generative linguistics.

Belloc argues that the development of capitalism was not a natural consequence of the Industrial Revolution, but a consequence of the earlier dissolution of the monasteries in England, which then shaped the course of English industrialisation. English capitalism then spread across the world.\nBelloc then makes his case for the natural instability of pure capitalism and discusses how he believes that attempts to reform capitalism will lead almost inexorably to an economy in which state regulation has removed the freedom of capitalism and thereby replaced capitalism with the Servile State, which shares with ancient slavery the fact that positive law (as opposed to custom or economic necessity by themselves) dictates that certain people will work for others, who likewise must take care of them.In the ninth section of the book, titled \"The Servile State Has Begun,\" Belloc explores various ways the servile state has started to creep its way back into modern life. Among these he includes minimum wage laws, employers liability laws, the Insurance Act, and compulsory arbitration.Belloc used his Catholicism and his experience of living alongside the small-scale peasant farmers of the Sussex Weald to advocate his thesis of having a property-owning democracy based on peasant smallholdings that would bring together the different social classes.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Densely unreadable as it is, there is something terribly banal about every one of its intellectual propositions; as hopelessly banal in its attempted chic as its predominant present tense.\" Lucy Ellmann reviewed the book for The Guardian, and wrote that it provides just what the literary landscape needs: \"Philip Roth says the novel is dead, but it would be more accurate to say the audience is dead \u2013 we're all just too polite to mention it.

No one else, except perhaps a conscientious reviewer, would sit out her entire presentation.\"Nicholas Spice of the London Review of Books saw parallels between the main character and Robert Musil's The Man Without Qualities and Georg B\u00fcchner's Woyzeck. Spice wrote: \"In Greed, Jelinek finds a way to deal with depth (with the abyss inside the human) without either reverting to the analgesic of realism or exhausting the reader with flood-lit ugliness. For all its derangement, Greed is not ugly. Indeed, once one has got used to it, it yields strange and memorable pleasures.\" However, Spice added: \"With its constant shifts of tone and register, the slippery sideways movement of thought through wordplay and punning, the frequent allusions to other German texts, the idiom of Greed poses almost insuperable obstacles to good translation. ... As it is, doubtless under tight economic constraints, the publishers have paid for a hit-and-miss, standard, 'by the page' translation and the result is a disaster.

The Arabic and Persian form of the name, Af\u0121\u0101n, was first attested in the 10th-century geography book Hudud al-'Alam. The last part of the name, \"-stan\", is a Persian suffix meaning \"place of\". Therefore, \"Afghanistan\" translates to \"land of the Afghans\", or \"land of the Pashtuns\" in a historical sense. According to the third edition of the Encyclopedia of Islam:\nThe name Afghanistan (Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, land of the Afghans / Pashtuns, af\u0101ghina, sing. afgh\u0101n) can be traced to the early eighth/fourteenth century, when it designated the easternmost part of the Kartid realm. This name was later used for certain regions in the \u1e62afavid and Mughal empires that were inhabited by Afghans.

Indeed, Klay's gifts become more apparent with each new narrator and circumstance: his reach, his tonal control, his observational sophistication, the sheer emotional torque of his narratives. By the end, he had convincingly inhabited more than a dozen different voices and I felt I had learned more about Iraq than in any documentary or factual account.\nWriting in the Daily Beast, Brian Castner described the book \"a clinic in the profanities of war\". He wrote:\nIf there is a flaw to be found here it is only one of narrowness; all of these narrators are American men and most are Marines.

He was deployed to the Anbar Province in 2007\u20138.Klay has said that before and during his service in Iraq he did not have a \"clear sense\" that he was going to write about war, but that when he shared his plan to enter the military upon graduation, his Dartmouth College teacher and mentor, the American poet Tom Sleigh:\n \"...made sure that before I went I'd read Tolstoy, Hemingway, Isaac Babel and David Jones.

It was reprinted in Fire and Forget: Short Stories from the Long War, an anthology of war fiction. Klay has stated that the process of writing the stories that became Redeployment involved years of meticulous research.Klay has described his own deployment in Iraq as \"a mild experience\" where he did not see the war itself but only the effects of war second hand. To depict the war, he created a dozen characters, each with a different set of experiences and perspectives. Avoiding cliches and creating \"prototypes\", he has said, \"was something I took very seriously. I did a lot a research, I talked to a lot of Marines, and spent a lot of time thinking about the subjects. Doing the kind of imaginative work, drafting stories over and over again until I had something that felt emotionally honest, which is also not the same as something that's going to please everyone who\u2019s been through that experience.\" He said he needed multiples voices because:\n...each person has such a small piece of the war, and that piece will be powerfully shaped not only by when they were there and where in Iraq they were, but also by what job they did. So rather than writing a unified novel about the experience of war, I wanted twelve different voices\u2014voices that would approach similar themes but from very different perspectives. I don't think all my narrators would get along with each other. I don't think they'd agree with each other about what the war meant. And part of my intent was that that would open a space for the reader to come in and critically engage with the sorts of claims the narrators are making.... Also, it's just fascinating to me to step into very different heads. What was the war like for a mortuary affairs specialist? For a chaplain? For an artilleryman, who never sees the bodies of the enemy he has killed?\nHe said he had some models in mind of what he did not want to do: \"There have been a couple books in the last couple years with almost comical misrepresentations of the military by authors who wanted to talk about Iraq, but clearly didn't want to do the hard work of learning enough about the subject to have something worth saying.\" Klay included in Redeployment a list of works he read and found valuable in helping to shape his writing. He explained that:\n...before writing about a foreign service officer I read a memoir by one who'd served in Iraq, a fairly wonky book about career diplomacy, a lot of Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction reports, and so on. I also read a Czech World War I novel that seemed appropriate to gear me up, in terms of tone, and I talked to Civil Affairs soldiers and Foreign Service Officers, and I read a lot of journalism.

{"id": "484_677", "question": "Who is the author of Le Ton beau de Marot?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_12730", "text": "Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language is a 1997 book by Douglas Hofstadter in which he explores the meaning, strengths, failings and beauty of translation. The book is a long and detailed examination of one short translation of a minor French poem and, through that, an examination of the mysteries of translation (and indeed more generally, language and consciousness) itself.  Hofstadter himself refers to it as \"my ruminations on the art of translation\".\nThe title itself is a pun, revealing many of the themes of the work: le ton beau means \u2018the beautiful tone\u2019 or \u2018the sweet tone\u2019, but the word order is unusual for French. It would be more common to write le beau ton. A French speaker hearing the title spoken ([l\u0259 t\u0254\u0303 bo d\u0259 ma.\u0281o]) would be more likely to interpret it as le tombeau de Marot; where tombeau may mean \u2018tomb\u2019 (as per the cover picture), but also tombeau, \u2018a work of art (literature or music) done in memory and homage to a deceased person\u2019 (the title is intended to parallel the title of Maurice Ravel's Le Tombeau de Couperin). In a further play on the title, Hofstadter refers to his deceased wife Carol, to whom the book is dedicated, as ma rose (\"my rose\"), and to himself as ton beau (\"your dear\").\nAt the surface level, the book treats the difficulties and rewards of translating works (particularly poetry) from one language to another. Diverse translations (usually to English) of a short poem in Renaissance French, Cl\u00e9ment Marot's A une Damoyselle malade (referred to as \u2018Ma mignonne\u2019 by Hofstadter), serve as reference points for his ideas on the subject. Groups of translations alternate with analysis and commentary on the same throughout the book. However, Hofstadter's reading of the idea of \u2018translation\u2019 goes deeper than simply that of translating between languages. Translation between frames of reference \u2014 languages, cultures, modes of expression or, indeed, between one person's thoughts and another \u2014 becomes an element in many of the same concepts Hofstadter has addressed in prior works, such as reference and self-reference, structure and function, and artificial intelligence.\nOne theme of this book is the loss of Hofstadter's wife Carol, who died of a brain tumor while the book was being written; she also created one of the numerous translations of Marot's poem presented in the book. In this context the poem, dedicated to \u2018a sick lady\u2019, gained yet another deeply tragic and personal meaning, even though the translations were started long before her illness was even known (Hofstadter went on to follow with an even more personal book titled I Am a Strange Loop after the death of his wife).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "257_48343", "text": "Charles is a major character in Les Rois maudits (The Accursed Kings), a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon.

The author of this letter claimed to be the unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, who had murdered and mutilated at least four women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London in the two months prior to Lusk receiving this letter, and whose vigilance committee Lusk led in civilian efforts to assist the police in identifying and apprehending the perpetrator.The letter was postmarked 15 October 1888 and was received by Lusk the following day. An examination of the kidney revealed the individual from whom the organ originated had suffered from Bright's disease. The author of this letter claimed to have fried and eaten the other half.Police, press, and public alike received many letters claiming to be from the Whitechapel Murderer, with investigators at one stage having to deal with an estimated 1,000 letters related to the case. However, the \"From Hell\" letter is one of the few articles of correspondence that has received serious consideration as to actually being genuine. Nonetheless, opinions remain divided with regards to the letter's authenticity.The murders committed by Jack the Ripper have attracted much attention in popular culture for decades, with several factual and fictional works directly making reference to the \"From Hell\" letter.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_12760", "text": "The \"From Hell\" letter is written with a much lower level of literacy than other letters purporting to be from the murderer, in that this letter features numerous errors in spelling and grammar. Scholars have debated whether this is a deliberate misdirection, as the author observed the silent k in \"knif[e]\" and h in \"whil[e]\". The formatting of the letter also features a cramped writing style in which letters are pressed together haphazardly; many ink blots appear in a manner which might indicate that the writer was unfamiliar with using a pen. The formatting of the message might point to it being a hoax by a well-educated individual, but some researchers have argued that it is the genuine work of a partly functional but deranged individual.Forensic handwriting expert Michelle Dresbold, working for the History Channel documentary series MysteryQuest, has argued that the letter is genuine, based on the peculiar characteristics of the handwriting, particularly the \"invasive loop\" letter \"y\"s. The criminal profiling experts in the programme also created a profile of the killer, stating that he possessed a deranged animosity towards women and skills in using a knife. Based on linguistic clues (including the use of the particular spelling of the word \"prasarved\" for \"preserved\"), Dresbold felt that the letter showed strong evidence that the writer was either Irish or of Irish extraction, indicating a possible link between the letter and known Ripper suspect Francis Tumblety. Tumblety was an itinerant Irish-American quack doctor who was mentally ill and who had resided in London during the year of the murders. He had had encounters with the law and a strong dislike of women, as well as a background of collecting body parts. However, after arresting him at the time as a suspect, the police ended up releasing him on bail, having failed to find hard evidence against him. He ultimately died of a heart condition in the U.S. in 1903. Sugden has also written that the author may have had an Irish background, but also stated that he may have had Cockney mannerisms.The purported diary of James Maybrick, another man who has been proposed as a Ripper suspect, contains references to the \"From Hell\" letter, particularly the alleged cannibalism.

An English translation by George Stanhope in 1694 ran through four editions in the early 18th century.

The oldest extant manuscripts of the authentic Enchiridion date from the 14th century, but the oldest Christianised ones date from the 10th and 11th centuries, perhaps indicating the Byzantine world's preference for the Christian versions. The Enchiridion was first translated into Latin by Niccol\u00f2 Perotti in 1450, and then by Angelo Poliziano in 1479.The first printed edition (editio princeps) was Poliziano's Latin translation published in 1497. The original Greek was first published (somewhat abbreviated) with Simplicius's Commentary in 1528. The edition published by Johann Schweigh\u00e4user in 1798 was the major edition for the next two-hundred years. A critical edition was produced by Gerard Boter in 1999.The separate editions and translations of the Enchiridion are very many. The Enchiridion reached its height of popularity in the period 1550\u20131750. It was translated into most European languages, and there were multiple translations in English, French, and German. The first English translation was by James Sandford  in 1567 (a translation of a French version) and this was followed by a translation (from the Greek) by John Healey in 1610. The Enchiridion was even partly translated into Chinese by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci. The popularity of the work was assisted by the Neostoicism movement initiated by Justus Lipsius in the 16th century. Another Neostoic, Guillaume du Vair, translated the book into French in 1586 and popularised it in his La Philosophie morale des Stoiques.In the English-speaking world it was particularly well-known in the 17th century: at that time it was the Enchiridion rather than the Discourses which was usually read. It was among the books John Harvard bequeathed to the newly-founded Harvard College in 1638. The work, being written in a clear distinct style, made it accessible to readers with no formal training in philosophy, and there was a wide readership among women in England. The writer Mary Wortley Montagu made her own translation of the Enchiridion in 1710 at the age of twenty-one. The Enchiridion was a common school text in Scotland during the Scottish Enlightenment\u2014Adam Smith had a 1670 edition in his library, acquired as a schoolboy. At the end of the 18th century the Enchiridion is attested in the personal libraries of Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.In the 19th century, Walt Whitman discovered the Enchiridion when he was about the age of sixteen.

{"id": "484_699", "question": "Who is the author of King James Version?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_12810", "text": "The King James Version (KJV), also the King James Bible (KJB) and the Authorized Version (AV), is an Early Modern English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England, which was commissioned in 1604 and published in 1611, by sponsorship of King James VI and I. The 80 books of the King James Version include 39 books of the Old Testament, 14 books of Apocrypha, and the 27 books of the New Testament. \nNoted for its \"majesty of style\", the King James Version has been described as one of the most important books in English culture and a driving force in the shaping of the English-speaking world. The King James Version remains the preferred translation of many Christian fundamentalists and religious movements, and it is considered one of the important literary accomplishments of early modern England.\nThe KJV was the third translation into English approved by the English Church authorities: The first had been the Great Bible (1535), and the second had been the Bishops' Bible (1568). In Switzerland the first generation of Protestant Reformers had produced the Geneva Bible which was published in 1560 having referred to the original Hebrew and Greek scriptures, which was influential in the writing of the Authorized King James Version.\nThe English Church initially used the officially sanctioned \"Bishops' Bible\", which was hardly used by the population. More popular was the named \"Geneva Bible\", which was created on the basis of the Tyndale translation in Geneva under the direct successor of the reformer John Calvin for his English followers. However, their footnotes represented a Calvinistic Puritanism that was too radical for King James. The translators of the Geneva Bible had translated the word king as tyrant about four hundred times\u2014the word tyrant does not appear once in the KJV. Because of this, it has been assumed King James purposely had the translators of the KJV mistranslate the word \"tyrant\" as either \"troubling\", \"oppressor\", or some other word to avoid people being critical of his monarchy, though there is no evidence to back up that claim.King James convened the Hampton Court Conference in January 1604, where a new English version was conceived in response to the problems of the earlier translations perceived by the Puritans, a faction of the Church of England. James gave translators instructions intended to ensure the new version would conform to the ecclesiology, and reflect the episcopal structure, of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament from Hebrew and Aramaic, and the Apocrypha from Greek and Latin. In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible for Epistle and Gospel readings, and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament.By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version had become effectively unchallenged as the only English translation used in Anglican and other English Protestant churches, except for the Psalms and some short passages in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England. Over the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English-speaking scholars. With the development of stereotype printing at the beginning of the 19th century, this version of the Bible had become the most widely printed book in history, almost all such printings presenting the standard text of 1769, and nearly always omitting the books of the Apocrypha. Today the unqualified title \"King James Version\" usually indicates this Oxford standard text.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_12811", "text": "The title of the first edition of the translation, in Early Modern English, was \"THE HOLY BIBLE, Conteyning the Old Te\u017ftament, AND THE NEW: Newly Tran\u017flated out of the Originall tongues: & with the former Tran\u017flations diligently compared and reui\u017fed, by his Maiesties \u017fpeciall C\u00f5mandement\". The title page carries the words \"Appointed to be read in Churches\", and F. F. Bruce suggests it was \"probably authorised by order in council\", but no record of the authorisation survives \"because the Privy Council registers from 1600 to 1613 were destroyed by fire in January 1618/19\".For many years it was common not to give the translation any specific name. In his Leviathan of 1651, Thomas Hobbes referred to it as \"the English Translation made in the beginning of the Reign of King James\". A 1761 \"Brief Account of the various Translations of the Bible into English\" refers to the 1611 version merely as \"a new, compleat, and more accurate Translation\", despite referring to the Great Bible by its name, and despite using the name \"Rhemish Testament\" for the Douay\u2013Rheims Bible version. Similarly, a \"History of England\", whose fifth edition was published in 1775, writes merely that \"[a] new translation of the Bible, viz., that now in Use, was begun in 1607, and published in 1611\".King James's Bible is used as the name for the 1611 translation (on a par with the Genevan Bible or the Rhemish Testament) in Charles Butler's Horae Biblicae (first published 1797). Other works from the early 19th century confirm the widespread use of this name on both sides of the Atlantic: it is found both in a \"historical sketch of the English translations of the Bible\" published in Massachusetts in 1815 and in an English publication from 1818, which explicitly states that the 1611 version is \"generally known by the name of King James's Bible\". This name was also found as King James' Bible (without the final \"s\"): for example in a book review from 1811. The phrase \"King James's Bible\" is used as far back as 1715, although in this case it is not clear whether this is a name or merely a description.The use of Authorized Version, capitalized and used as a name, is found as early as 1814. For some time before this, descriptive phrases such as \"our present, and only publicly authorised version\" (1783), \"our Authorized version\" (1731, 1792) and \"the authorized version\" (1801, uncapitalized) are found. A more common appellation in the 17th and 18th centuries was \"our English translation\" or \"our English version\", as can be seen by searching one or other of the major online archives of printed books. In Britain, the 1611 translation is generally known as the \"Authorized Version\" today. The term is somewhat of a misnomer because the text itself was never formally \"authorized\", nor were English parish churches ever ordered to procure copies of it.King James' Version, evidently a descriptive phrase, is found being used as early as 1814. \"The King James Version\" is found, unequivocally used as a name, in a letter from 1855.

In 1763 The Critical Review complained that \"many false interpretations, ambiguous phrases, obsolete words and indelicate expressions ... excite the derision of the scorner\". Blayney's 1769 version, with its revised spelling and punctuation, helped change the public perception of the Authorized Version to a masterpiece of the English language. By the 19th century, F. W. Faber could say of the translation, \"It lives on the ear, like music that can never be forgotten, like the sound of church bells, which the convert hardly knows how he can forego.\"Geddes MacGregor called the Authorized Version \"the most influential version of the most influential book in the world, in what is now its most influential language\", \"the most important book in English religion and culture\", and \"the most celebrated book in the English-speaking world\". David Crystal has estimated that it is responsible for 257 idioms in English; examples include feet of clay and reap the whirlwind. Furthermore, prominent atheist figures such as Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins have praised the King James Version as being \"a giant step in the maturing of English literature\" and \"a great work of literature\", respectively, with Dawkins then adding, \"A native speaker of English who has never read a word of the King James Bible is verging on the barbarian\".The King James Version is one of the versions authorized to be used in the services of the Episcopal Church and other parts of the Anglican Communion, as it is the historical Bible of this church. \nIt was presented to King Charles III at his coronation service Other Christian denominations have also accepted the King James Version. The King James Version is used by English-speaking Conservative Anabaptists, along with Methodists of the conservative holiness movement, in addition to certain Baptists. In the Orthodox Church in America, it is used liturgically and was made \"the 'official' translation for a whole generation of American Orthodox\". The later Service Book of the Antiochian archdiocese, in vogue today, also uses the King James Version. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints continues to use its own edition of the Authorized Version as its official English Bible.\nAlthough the Authorized Version's preeminence in the English-speaking world has diminished\u2014for example, the Church of England recommends six other versions in addition to it\u2014it is still the most used translation in the United States, especially as the Scofield Reference Bible for Evangelicals. However, over the past forty years it has been gradually overtaken by modern versions, principally the New International Version (1973), the New Revised Standard Version (1989), and the English Standard Version (2001), the latter of which is seen as a successor to the King James Version.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Its members were initially both Jewish and Arab but the Arabs' increasing success impelled them to break from the Jews around the time of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in the late seventh century. They flirted with Christianity, learning a respect for Jesus as prophet and Mary as Virgin, before asserting an independent Abrahamic monotheist identity. This borrowed key concepts from the Jewish breakaway sect of Samaritanism: \"the idea of a scripture limited to the Pentateuch, a prophet like Moses (Muhammad), a holy book revealed like the Torah (the Quran), a sacred city (Mecca) with a nearby mountain (Jabal an-Nour) and shrine (the Kaaba) of an appropriate patriarch (Abraham), plus a caliphate modeled on an Aaronid priesthood.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "484_12895", "text": "Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World is a 1977 book about the early history of Islam by the historians Patricia Crone and Michael Cook.

Crone and Cook contend that an alliance of Arabs and Jews sought to reclaim the Promised Land from the Byzantine Empire, that the Qur'an consists of 8th-century edits of various Judeo-Christian and other Middle-Eastern sources, and that Muhammad was the herald of Umar \"the redeemer\", a  Judaic messiah.Although the hypotheses proposed in Hagarism have been criticized, even by the authors themselves, the book has been hailed as a seminal work in its branch of Islamic historiography. The book questioned prevailing assumptions about traditional sources, proposing new interpretations that opened avenues for research and discussion. It connected the history of early Islam to other areas, from Mediterranean late antiquity to theories of acculturation. Following earlier critical work by  Goldziher,  Schacht, and  Wansbrough, it challenged scholars to use a much wider methodology, including techniques already used in biblical studies.

The stories were first published in Blackwood's Magazine over the course of the year 1857, initially anonymously, before being released as a two-volume set by Blackwood and Sons in January 1858. The three stories are set during the last twenty years of the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century over a fifty-year period. The stories take place in and around the fictional town of Milby in the English Midlands. Each of the Scenes concerns a different Anglican clergyman, but is not necessarily centred upon him. Eliot examines, among other things, the effects of religious reform and the tension between the Established and the Dissenting Churches on the clergymen and their congregations, and draws attention to various social issues, such as poverty, alcoholism and domestic violence.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_13069", "text": "Scenes of Clerical Life has been reprinted in book form several times since 1858, including five editions within Eliot's lifetime.

Eliot was forced to apologise to John Gwyther, who had been the local curate in her childhood, and to whom the character of Barton himself bore more than a passing resemblance.\nInitial criticism of Amos Barton was mixed, with Blackwood's close friend W. G. Hamley \"dead against Amos\" and Thackeray diplomatically noncomittal. However, the complete Scenes of Clerical Life was met with 'just and discerning applause', and considerable speculation as to the identity of its author. Sales were no better than satisfactory, following a first printing of 1,500 copies, but Blackwood was none the less confident of Eliot's talent. Early reviewers deemed the writer \"religious, without cant or intolerance\" and \"strong in his  [sic] knowledge of the human heart\". It was praised for its realism: one contemporary review noted approvingly that \"the fictitious element is securely based upon a broad groundwork of actual truth, truth as well in detail as in general\". Due to its subject matter, it was widely assumed to be the work of a real-life country parson; one such even attempted to take the credit. Popular opinion in Eliot's home town attributed the work to a Mr Joseph Liggins, who attempted ineffectually to deny the rumours, and eventually accepted the undeserved celebrity. George Eliot's \"identity\" was revealed in a letter to The Times, but this claim was immediately refuted in a letter from Eliot herself. In 1858 Charles Dickens wrote to Eliot to express his approval of the book, and was among the first to suggest that Scenes of Clerical Life might have been written by a woman.I have been so strongly affected by the two first tales in the book you have had the kindness to send me, through Messrs. Blackwood, that I hope you will excuse my writing to you to express my admiration of their extraordinary merit. The exquisite truth and delicacy both of the humour and the pathos of these stories, I have never seen the like of; and they have impressed me in a manner that I should find it very difficult to describe to you. if I had the impertinence to try. In addressing these few words of thankfulness to the creator of the Sad Fortunes of the Rev. Amos Barton, and the sad love-story of Mr. Gilfil, I am (I presume) bound to adopt the name that it pleases that excellent writer to assume. I can suggest no better one: but I should have been strongly disposed, if I had been left to my own devices, to address the said writer as a woman. I have observed what seemed to me such womanly touches in those moving fictions, that the assurance on the title-page is insufficient to satisfy me even now. If they originated with no woman, I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself mentally so like a woman since the world began.\nMore recently, Scenes of Clerical Life has been interpreted mainly in relation to Eliot's later works. It has been claimed that \"in Scenes of Clerical Life, her style and manner as a novelist were still in the making\". Ewen detects \"an obvious awkwardness in the handling of the materials of the Scenes and a tendency... to moralize\", but affirms that \"these stories are germinal for the George Eliot to come\". \"The emergent novelist is glimpsed in the way in which the three scenes interpenetrate to establish a densely textured, cumulative study of a particular provincial location, its beliefs and customs and way of life.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Oppenheimer wrote the book in Frankfurt am Main during 1907, as a fragment of the four-volume System of Sociology, an intended interpretative framework for the understanding of social evolution on which he laboured from the 1890s until the end of his life. The work summarizes Oppenheimer's general theory on the origin, development and future transformation of the state. The State, which Oppenheimer's missionary zeal pervades, was widely read and passionately discussed in the early 20th century. It was well received by\u2014and influential on\u2014as diverse an audience as Zionist settlers in Palestine (halutzim), American and Slavic communitarians, West German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, and anarcho-capitalists like Murray Rothbard.A classical liberal and socialist sympathiser, Oppenheimer regarded capitalism as \"a system of exploitation and capital revenues as the gain of that exploitation\", but placed the blame not on the genuinely free market, but on the intervention of the state. Oppenheimer's view of the state is profoundly opposed to the then dominant characterisation propounded by G. W. F. Hegel of the state as an admirable achievement of modern civilisation. Proponents of this view tend to accept the social contract view that the State came about as every larger groups of people agreed to subordinate their private interests for the common good.\nIn contrast, Opphenheimer's view was an advancement of the \"conquest theory\" of the state that developed during the late 19th century by Ludwig Gumplowicz. According to conquest theory, the state came into being through war and conquest, a consequence of which was the establishment of social classes; the dominant conquerors and the subordinate conquered. This, in turn, led to the emergence of a political system to consolidate the power of the conquerors, to perpetuate and regulate class divisions. Oppenheimer's views led the American essayist, Albert Jay Nock, writing in the first half of the 20th century, to remark that in his own book, Our Enemy, the State:\n\nTaking the State wherever found, striking into its history at any point, one sees no way to differentiate the activities of its founders, administrators and beneficiaries from those of a professional-criminal class.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "106_15830", "text": "In Christianity, the word state may be taken to signify a profession or calling in life.

He looked back on the years of work on Crow as a time of imaginative freedom and creative energy, which he felt that he never subsequently recovered. He described Crow as his masterpiece...\n\nRecurring themes draw extensively from world mythologies and collective archetypes, including both trickster and Christian mythology. A central core group of poems in Crow can be seen as an attack on Christianity.

He believes primarily in the will of man, and lives by the belief \"all or nothing\". To make compromises is therefore difficult, or questionable. Brand's beliefs render him lonely, because those around him, when put to the test, generally cannot or will not follow his example. He is a young idealist whose main purpose is to save the world, or at least people's souls, but his judgment of others is harsh and unfair.\nThe word brand means \"fire\" in Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Dutch.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "106_16910", "text": "On November 9, 1972, the California State Board of Education held hearings to examine creation science. Leonard Brand, along with Loma Linda University colleague Ariel Roth, made presentations. Brand contended that creationist views are misunderstood in that creationists also believe in evolution of species within the major groups of plants and animals.  The evidence for this was very good, he said. They \"have no argument with experimental evidence.\" In conclusion, he stated that students in California schools should be allowed to hear both theories and form their own conclusions.Leonard Brand has authored two books on the creation\u2013evolution controversy, Faith, Reason and Earth History (1997, 2nd Ed. 2009) and Beginnings (2007). Both are published in English and Spanish, and the former is also published in Portuguese.Ichnologist Martin Lockley wrote a critical review of FREH, accusing Brand of unscrupulousness and ignorance. He said the book \"shows us, on the one hand, a very curious mix of what appear to be a few genuine attempts, by creationists, to do good science, or at least better science than they have done in the past, and, on the other hand, what appear to be quite ridiculous and extraordinarily naive interpretations of classic geological localities such as the Grand Canyon.\"Young Earth Creationists include Leonard Brand among their leaders. They often cite his field and lab research as evidence for the biblical flood. Marcus R. Ross of Liberty University includes Brand's Faith, Reason and Earth's History in a short list of \"well-researched YEC writings on geology.\" These \"excellent sources\" include Steven Austin, Kurt Wise, Leonard Brand and Andrew A. Snelling. In August, 2008, Brand gave the keynote address at the Seventh Creation Biology Study Groups Conference entitled  \u201cOrigins Research: A Better Worldview Yields Better Research Questions.\u201dBrand participates in the creation\u2013evolution controversy less confrontationally than many creationists.  Young and Stearley, two Christian geologists who disagree with Brand's young earth views, state that he, along with Ariel Roth and some other recent flood geology advocates \"have a much more irenic and moderate tone that provides a welcome contrast to the sarcastic, sometimes disrespectful tone and unwarrantedly dogmatic pronouncements of earlier creationists.\" In a foreword to Brand's book Faith, Reason and Earth History Kurt Wise applauds the book for breaking free from the \"science-bashing spirit\" prevalent in creationist literature. Lockley suggests that Brand is \"writing for people of faith\" and that his more sympathetic approach may have a greater impact in \"educat[ing] creationists to a scientific way of thinking\" than the more confrontational approach of many anti-creationists.Brand argues for integrity in creationist arguments, against using material that has many errors and writing \"without having the scientific training to match their zeal.\"In his PhD dissertation, Thomas McIver reports that:\nZoologist Leonard Brand used live reptiles and amphibians in his lab to see how footprints were formed in different conditions: dry, damp, and wet sand, and when the animals were walking on sand underwater.  The underwater tracks, he concludes, resembles most closely fossil tracks such as found in the Grand Canyon\u2019s Coconino Sandstone.  This contradicts the evolutionist assumption of the desert origin of the sandstone, and supports the Flood model.  Brand has published these experiments both in GRI\u2019s journal Origins (1978) as well as a standard scientific journal (1979).\nBrand distinguishes between scientific data and presuppositions:\n\nThe difference between a creationist and an evolutionist isn't a difference in the scientific data, but a difference in philosophy \u2013 a difference in the presuppositions...\nBrand teaches that his biblical views help him propose questions for research. On page 8 of the book Beginnings, he states,\n\nIn my approach, I retain the scientific method of observation and experimentation, but I also allow study of Scripture to open my eyes to things that I might otherwise overlook and to suggest new hypotheses to test. This approach is not just a theory; some of us have been using it for years with success.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The antonym 'dystopia' is used for hypothetical places of great suffering or injustice, including systems that present or market themselves as utopian but actually have terrible other sides to them.\nAlthough he may not have directly founded the contemporary notion of what has since become known as Utopian and dystopian fiction, More certainly popularised the idea of imagined parallel realities, and some of the early works that owe a debt to Utopia must include The City of the Sun by Tommaso Campanella, Description of the Republic of Christianopolis by Johannes Valentinus Andreae, New Atlantis by Francis Bacon and Candide by Voltaire.\nUtopian socialism was used to describe the first concepts of socialism, but later Marxist theorists tended to see the ideas as too simplistic and not grounded on realistic principles. The religious message in the work and its uncertain, possibly satiric, tone has also alienated some theorists from the work.An applied example of More's Utopia can be seen in Vasco de Quiroga's implemented society in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, which was directly inspired by More's work.\nDuring the opening scene in the film A Man for All Seasons, Utopia is mentioned in a conversation. The alleged amorality of England's priests is compared to that of the more highly principled behaviour of the fictional priests in More's Utopia when a character observes wryly that \"every second person born in England is fathered by a priest.\"\nIn 2006, the artist Rory Macbeth inscribed all 40,000 words on the side of an old electricity factory in Norwich, England.The fantastic voyage genre owes to Lucian's A True Story; in his lifetime More was better known as a translator of Lucian's satires, with Erasmus, than for Utopia.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "484_13566", "text": "Utopia was begun while More was an envoy in the Low Countries in May 1515.

It was not until 1551, sixteen years after More's execution, that it was first published in England as an English translation by Ralph Robinson. Gilbert Burnet's translation of 1684 is probably the most commonly cited version.\nThe work seems to have been popular, if misunderstood, since the introduction of More's Epigrams of 1518 mentions a man who did not regard More as a good writer.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It includes biographies of the three co-directors, Robert Kalfin, Michael David, and Burl Hash, and anecdotes about behind-the-scenes activities at the Chelsea.\nIt is also a history of the funding crisis for the arts in America. It explores the theater's socioeconomic milieu in the 1970s. There are stories about attempts to censor the arts and describing increasing anti-arts sentiment in this country.\nThe book features a foreword by Broadway director and producer Harold Prince. Prince discusses the problems of maintaining an art theater in a commercial society.\nIt is written in the style of a novel, even though it is a non-fiction work. The model for the book is Voltaire's Candide.\nThis book was one of a handful on the forefront of the field of creative non-fiction. Three years after its publication, in 1994, the Creative Nonfiction Foundation was established. The author reports that when she submitted a draft of the work as a doctoral dissertation, she was asked to rewrite it because the creative nonfiction approach had not yet been accepted in the academic community. According to her report, members of her dissertation committee said that while it was thorough and accurate, they felt they were reading a novel; they asked her to make changes in the style so that it no longer met the criteria of creative nonfiction. She did so in order to get her doctorate, but submitted the earlier draft to publishers. The chapter titles, written in the style of Voltaire's 'Candide' (listed below), were particularly controversial.\nThe Chelsea Theater Center was founded in 1965 and closed in 1986. It was in residence at the Brooklyn Academy of Music from 1968 to 1978. Before and after that time, it worked in theaters in Manhattan, mainly the Westside Theater.\nGlenn Close, Frank Langella, Christopher Lloyd and Meryl Streep were among the actors who worked at the Chelsea. Directors included Des McAnuff, Hal Prince, John Hirsch, and Alan Schneider.\nIn 1965, when Robert Kalfin founded the Chelsea, there were few nonprofit theaters in New York. During the next ten years, new theaters opened, funding sources decreased, and costs rose. Many nonprofit theaters started to do conventional work that would attract audiences. Kalfin and his partners, David and Hash, continued to do innovative work.\nCritics often said that the Chelsea stretched the boundaries of theater.

Then a professor at Yale University, Boswell was a specialist on homosexuality in Christian Europe, having previously authored three books on the subject. It proved to be his final publication, released in the same year as his death.\nBoswell's primary argument is that throughout much of medieval Christian Europe, unions between figures of the same sex and gender were socially accepted. Outlining the problems with accurately translating Ancient Greek and Latin terms regarding love, relationships, and unions into English, he discusses the wider context of marriage and unions in the classical world and early Christian Europe.\nThe book attracted widespread academic and popular attention on publication. Reviews in academic, peer-reviewed journals were mixed, with some scholars arguing that Boswell's translation of key terms was incorrect. The book was also widely reviewed in the mainstream media and the Christian media, with some conservative reviewers claiming that it was written to support the \"gay agenda\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_13729", "text": "In 2003, The Friend by the scholar Alan Bray was published. Continuing Boswell's line of research, it served as a defense of his thesis, confirming that, \"[f]or a very long period, formal amatory unions, conjugal, elective and indissoluble, between two members of the same sex were made in Europe, publicly recognised and consecrated in churches through Christian ritual.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "484_13728", "text": "In the introduction, Boswell highlights the subjectivity of marital unions, which differ between societies in their function and purpose. He explains his use of \"same-sex unions\" over \"gay marriage\", outlining the epistemological problems of the latter in a historical context. Noting that same-sex unions have been ethnographically and historically recorded in Africa, Asia and the Americas, he remarks that there is no reason why they should not have been found in Europe. He acknowledges that the book focuses on male same-sex unions, explaining that the historical evidence from pre-modern Europe predominantly discusses men, the socially dominant gender of the time.\nChapter one, \"The Vocabulary of Love and Marriage\", highlights the problems in translating words describing both emotions and unions from Ancient Greek and Latin into Modern English, and explains that \"marriage\" carries with it many associations for contemporary westerners that would have been alien to pre-modern Europe. The second chapter, \"Heterosexual Matrimony in the Greco-Roman World\", explains the multiple forms of mixed-sex union found in classical Europe. Wealthy men could enter into one or more different types of erotic, sexual or romantic relationships with women; they could use those who were slaves or servants who were under their domination for sexual gratification, hire a prostitute, hire a concubine, or marry a woman (either monogamously, or in many cases, polygamously).In chapter three, \"Same-Sex Unions in the Greco-Roman World\", Boswell argues that between circa 400 BCE and 400 CE, male same-sex relationships were treated much the same as mixed-sex relationships, albeit being \"more fluid and less legalistic\". He cites historical examples such as those of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, and Hadrian and Antinous, as well as literary examples such as Nisus and Euryalus in Virgil's Aeneid, and characters in Petronius' Satyricon and Xenophon of Ephesus' Ephesian Tale. He dismisses the counter-argument that these men were friends rather than lovers, and argues that the Latin term for \"brother\" was a euphemism for \"lover\". Moving on to the evidence for consecrated same-sex unions in classical Europe, he discusses Nero's union with Sporus, Martial's description of a male\u2013male \"marriage\" in the early second century, and a female\u2013female union in Lucian's Dialogues of the Courtesans. Boswell argues that these same-sex unions were not \"imitative\" of mixed-sex marriage, but perhaps represented an attempt by same-sex couples to \"participate in\" the wider culture. He subsequently deals with the introduction of legal prohibitions against such same-sex unions in the late Empire.Chapter four, \"Views of the New Religion\", looks at the influence of early Christianity on relationships. Noting that the faith encouraged asceticism and celibacy, he discusses the devalued role of marriage in Christian society, and the increased popularity of asexual marriage. He moves on to look at the evidence for same-sex \"paired saints\" in early Christianity, such as Nearchos and Polyeuct, Ruth and Naomi, and Serge and Bacchus, arguing that these couples were perhaps romantically involved. The fifth chapter, \"The Development of Nuptial Offices\", opens by explaining that the early Christian Church was uninterested in marriage ceremonies, which were largely left secular; he notes that the Western Church only declared marriage a sacrament and developed canonical laws to regulate ceremonies at the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215. He then discusses Barberini 336, a circa-eighth-century Greek liturgical manuscript containing four ceremonies for sacramental union, one of which is between two men. Discussing this and similar recorded ceremonies, Boswell questions what they represent, if they reflect homosexuality, and ponders if these are \"marriage\" ceremonies, in doing so rejecting the idea that they represent ceremonies of adoption or \"spiritual fraternity\". The sixth chapter, \"Comparisons of Same-Sex and Heterosexual Ceremonies of Union\", looks at these ceremonies, and their varying similarities and differences.Chapter seven, \"The History of Same-Sex Unions in Medieval Europe\", looks at further evidence for such ceremonies in the Byzantine Empire, including stories such as those of Nicholas and Basil, and then examines the Christian prohibitions that were later introduced to put a stop to them.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Rather it was staged by William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle (at the time, he was the Earl of Newcastle) at Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire, in honor of King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria. Newcastle had put on a Jonson masque for his royal visitors at Welbeck in Nottinghamshire the year before: The King's Entertainment at Welbeck, performed on 21 May 1633. It was such a success that the King requested another on his 1634 royal progress. The Duke spent between \u00a314,000 and \u00a315,000 on staging the Bolsover masque and providing for his royal guests and their attendants, which was more than double the \u00a34,000 to \u00a35,000 he'd spent for the Welbeck entertainment the previous year. (The Masque of Beauty, one of Jonson's early Court masques, had cost \u00a34,000 to stage in 1608, and was considered exorbitantly expensive at the time.)\nIn Love's Welcome, Jonson continued the mockery of Inigo Jones that he'd practiced for two decades, starting Bartholomew Fair (1614) and continuing through The Masque of Augurs (1622), Neptune's Triumph for the Return of Albion (1624), The Staple of News (1626), and A Tale of a Tub (1633).

The story is the continued adventures of Eragon and his dragon Saphira, centering on their journey to the realm of the Elves in order to further Eragon's training as a Dragon Rider. Other plots in the story focus on Roran, Eragon's cousin, who leads the inhabitants of Carvahall to Surda to join the Varden, and Nasuada as she takes on her father's role as leader of the Varden.\nReviews pointed out the similarities between Eldest and other works such as The Lord of the Rings, while praising the themes of the book, such as friendship and honor. Several of these reviews commented on the style and genre of Eldest, while others considered the possibility of a film adaptation similar to the first film.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_13824", "text": "Eldest received generally negative reviews, and was met with criticism similar to Eragon for its derivative nature. School Library Journal noted that Eldest lacked originality, but would still find reception among fans. It also acknowledged that themes of Eldest are based generally on the works of other writers. BookBrowse also criticized Eldest, but said, as School Library Journal noted, that nothing the reviewers can say will stop some children from reading the book. Entertainment Weekly rated Eldest as one of the worst five books of 2005, calling it a \"700-page drag.\" The Boston Globe gave a negative review for Eldest, criticizing the very low points and for \"drama that rises to a wet pop.\" The Christian Science Monitor gave Eldest a C+ grade. Similar to other reviews, it criticized the long plot and its similarities to The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, as well as the lack of humor. The review commented that Roran, one of the secondary major characters, had the best part of the book. SFSignal also gave Eldest a poor review, giving it one out of five stars. The main reason of this was for its dull pace. The SFSignal review, like The Christian Science Monitor, did say that Roran had the \"strongest sequence\" in the book.However, there were also some more positive reviews of Eldest. Bookmarks magazine saw Eldest's similarity to other works, but said that Eldest displayed more emotional depth than Eragon. Publishers Weekly also gave a positive review for Eldest, praising the revelations in the final pages. Barnes & Noble gave a positive review for Eldest, in particular for its style, characters and themes such as friendship, forgiveness, responsibility, and honor. Eldest won the 2006 Quill Award in Young Adult Literature. Eldest also was nominated for a British Book Award in the Children's Book of the Year section, the Disney Adventures Book Award, the Colorado Blue Spruce Award, Young Adult Book Award, and the Wyoming Soaring Eagle Book Award.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The manga was adapted into an anime television series titled Sakura Momoko Theater Coji-Coji (\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3082\u3082\u3053\u5287\u5834 \u30b3\u30b8\u30b3\u30b8, Sakura Momoko Gekij\u014d Koji Koji) which aired from October 4, 1997, until September 25, 1999, on TBS in Japan. It features the titular Coji-Coji, the mysterious \"Child of the Universe\" with God-like powers. Coji-Coji has demonstrated his ability to erase the universe, fire powerful beams of energy, and live for millennia. Rather than use his powers, Coji-Coji spends his carefree days \"eating, sleeping, and playing\" in the land of Meruhen with a colorful cast of friends, including a talking snowman and a half fish half bird who can neither fly nor swim.\nMuch of the humor of the show is derived from Coji-Coji's blunt comments and social misunderstandings that border on callousness. Coji-Coji, however, is ultimately kind-hearted and helps his friends, if in unnoticed ways. Another running theme of the show is Coji-Coji's friends' ignorance of his God-like abilities. Coji-Coji makes no effort to conceal his powers, however: his friends simply never notice because he appears too simple and naive.\nIn addition to the anime series, there is a Dreamcast party game from Marvelous Entertainment based on the television series. The Dreamcast microphone was used to play the game. The title character is voiced by Shizuka Aoki, and it also features the vocal talents of Urara Takano and Katashi Ishizuka.

Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelisations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd, and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is With a Mind to Kill by Anthony Horowitz, published in May 2022. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.\nThe character\u2014also known by the code number 007 (pronounced \"double-oh-seven\")\u2014has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are one of the longest continually running film series and have grossed over US$7.04 billion in total at the box office, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of 2021, there have been twenty-five films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, No Time to Die (2021), stars Daniel Craig in his fifth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent Bond film productions: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof starring David Niven) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, 1965's Thunderball, both starring Connery). In 2015, the series was estimated to be worth $19.9 billion in total (based on box-office grosses, DVD sales and merchandise tie-ins), making James Bond one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. Casino Royale has also been adapted for television, as a one-hour show in 1954 as part of the CBS series Climax!.\nThe Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including their soundtracks, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and three wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch.

The first parody was the 1964 film Carry On Spying, which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind (Charles Hawtry) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor). One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series, whose first film, The Ipcress File, starring Michael Caine, was released in 1965. The eponymous hero is a rough-edged, petty crook turned spy, and was what academic Jeremy Packer called an \"anti-Bond\", or what Christoph Lindner calls \"the thinking man's Bond\". The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer Ken Adam, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry. The four \"Matt Helm\" films starring Dean Martin (released between 1966 and 1969), the \"Flint\" series starring James Coburn (comprising two films, one each in 1966 and 1969), while The Man from U.N.C.L.E. also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture. More recently, the Austin Powers series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers, and other parodies such as the Johnny English trilogy of films, have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films.\n\nFollowing the release of the film Dr. No in 1962, the line \"Bond ... James Bond\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the \"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\". In 2001, it was voted as the \"best-loved one-liner in cinema\" by British cinema goers, and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series. The 2005 American Film Institute's '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero. He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by Empire and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by Premiere. In 1965, Time magazine observed \"James Bond has developed into the biggest mass-cult hero of the decade\".\nThe 25 James Bond films produced by Eon are the longest continually running film series of all time, and including the two non Eon produced films, the 27 Bond films have grossed over $7.04 billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing franchise to date. It is estimated that since Dr. No, a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film. The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they \"form the backbone of the industry\".Television also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which was described as the \"first network television imitation\" of Bond, largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo. Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include I Spy, and Get Smart.Considered a British cultural icon, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II's escort. From 1968 to 2003, and since 2016, the Cadbury chocolate box Milk Tray has been advertised by the 'Milk Tray Man', a tough James Bond\u2013style figure who undertakes daunting 'raids' to surreptitiously deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady. Bond has been commemorated numerous times on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail, most recently in their March 2020 series to mark the 25th Bond film release.Throughout the life of the film series, a number of tie-in products have been released. \"Bondmania\", a term deriving from the adjacent \"Beatlemania\" and initiated in 1964 following the enormous success of Goldfinger, described the clamour for Bond films and their related products, from soundtrack LPs to children's toys, board games, alarm clocks playing the Bond theme, and 007-branded shirts. In 2018, a James Bond museum opened atop the Austrian Alps. The futuristic museum is constructed on the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain in S\u00f6lden at 10,000 ft (3,048 m) above sea level.The real MI6 has an ambiguous relationship with Bond. The films may attract job applicants who may be unsuited for espionage, while dissuading more-qualified candidates. While serving as Chief of SIS, Alex Younger said that were Bond to apply for a MI6 job \"he would have to change his ways\". Younger said, however, that the franchise had \"created a powerful brand for MI6 ... Many of our counterparts envy the sheer global recognition of our acronym\", and that being depicted to global audiences as a \"ubiquitous intelligence presence\" was \"quite a force multiplier\".

However, Maguire had released the rights to Universal Pictures, which had planned to develop a live-action feature film. In 1998, Schwartz persuaded Maguire to release the rights to a stage production while also making what Schwartz himself called an \"impassioned plea\" to Universal producer Marc Platt to realize Schwartz's own intended adaptation. Persuaded, Platt signed on as joint producer of the project with Universal and David Stone.The novel, described as a political, social, and ethical commentary on the nature of good and evil, takes place in the Land of Oz, in the years surrounding Dorothy's arrival. The story centers on Elphaba, a misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl with emerald-green skin, who grows up to become the notorious Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become Glinda the Good. The story is divided into five scenes based on the location and presents events, characters, and situations adapted from L Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 film adaptation in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be \"Wicked\", and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script. To this end, he collaborated with Emmy Award-winning writer Winnie Holzman to develop the outline of the plot over the course of a year, while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, creating an original stage piece rather than a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.While the draft followed Maguire's idea of retelling the story of the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation \"goes far afield\" from the novel. Holzman observed in an interview with Playbill that: \"It was [Maguire's] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops\u2014and really the whole plot\u2014is different onstage.\" Schwartz justified the deviation, saying: \"Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda\u2014who becomes Glinda\u2014and Elphaba... the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.\" Other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda and eventually becoming the Tin Woodman instead of Nick Chopper, cutting Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, Doctor Dillamond being fired instead of being murdered, and Madame Morrible going to prison instead of dying.\nThe book, lyrics, and score for the musical were developed through a series of readings. In these developmental workshops, Kristin Chenoweth, the Tony Award\u2013winning actress whom Schwartz had in mind while composing the music for the character, joined the project as Glinda. Stephanie J. Block played Elphaba in the workshops (she played Elphaba in the first national tour and later as a Broadway cast replacement) before Idina Menzel was cast in the role in late 2002. Earlier that year, the creators recruited New York producer Stone, who began planning the Broadway production. Joe Mantello was engaged as director and Wayne Cilento as choreographer, while designer Eugene Lee created the set and visual style for the production inspired by W. W. Denslow's original illustrations for Baum's novels and Maguire's concept of the story being told through a giant clock. Costume designer Susan Hilferty created a \"twisted Edwardian\" style in building more than 200 costumes, while lighting designer Kenneth Posner used more than 800 lights to give each of the 54 distinct scenes and locations \"its own mood\". By April 2003, the show was in rehearsals.Following the out-of-town tryout in San Francisco in May and June 2003, which received mixed critical reception, the creative team made extensive changes before its transfer to Broadway. Holzman recalled:\n\nStephen [Schwartz] wisely had insisted on having three months to rewrite in between the time we closed in San Francisco and when we were to go back into rehearsals in New York. That was crucial; that was the thing that made the biggest difference in the life of the show. That time is what made the show work.\nElements of the book were rewritten, while several songs underwent minor changes. \"Which Way is the Party?\", the introductory song to the character Fiyero, was replaced by \"Dancing Through Life\". Concern existed that Menzel's Elphaba \"got a little overshadowed\" by Chenoweth's Glinda, with San Francisco Chronicle critic Robert Hurwitt writing, \"Menzel's brightly intense Elphaba the Wicked Witch [needs] a chance of holding her own alongside Chenoweth's gloriously, insidiously bubbly Glinda.\" As a result, the creative team set about making Elphaba \"more prominent\". In making the Broadway revisions, Schwartz recalled, \"It was clear there was work to be done and revisions to be made in the book and the score. The critical community was, frankly, very helpful to us.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "484_13210", "text": "Wicked is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman.

Frank Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film adaptation.\nThe musical is told from the perspective of two witches of the Land of Oz. Its plot begins before and continues after Dorothy Gale arrives in Oz from Kansas. Wicked tells the story of two unlikely friends, Elphaba (later known as the Wicked Witch of the West) and Galinda (later known as Glinda the Good), whose friendship struggles through their opposing personalities, viewpoints, same love interest, reactions to the Wonderful Wizard's corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's fall from grace.\nProduced by Universal Stage Productions, in coalition with Marc Platt, Jon B. Platt, and David Stone, with direction by Joe Mantello and choreography by Wayne Cilento, the original production of Wicked premiered on Broadway at the Gershwin Theatre in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's Curran Theatre in May and June of that year. Its original stars included Idina Menzel as Elphaba, Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda, and Joel Grey as the Wizard.

His treatment of perspective was the most influential of his recommendations, being powerfully implemented by Leonardo da Vinci, and through him to the whole Italian Renaissance.Alberti made at least 29 uses of Pliny the Elder's Natural History, deriving his key themes of simplicity and seriousness directly from Pliny. For example, Alberti advised artists to use colour with restraint, and to paint in the effect of gold rather than using actual gold in their paintings. Gold did indeed vanish from Italian paintings of the second part of the 15th century. Artists however found their own ways to paint with restraint, rather than following Alberti's actual instructions directly. Similarly, he encouraged artists to add black when modelling shapes, rather than only adding white as Cennino Cennini had advised in his c. 1390 Il Libro dell'Arte. This advice had the effect of making Italian renaissance paintings more sombre.

As an artist, architect, poet and philosopher, he revolutionized the history of art with his theories of perspective in On Painting (1435). Inspired by the order and beauty inherent in nature, his groundbreaking work sets out the principles of distance, dimension and proportion; instructs the painter on how to use the rules of composition, representation, light and colour to create work that is graceful and pleasing to the eye; and stipulates the moral and artistic pre-requisites of the successful painter. \nOn Painting had an immediate and profound influence on Italian Renaissance artists including Ghiberti, Fra Angelico and Veneziano and on later figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, and remains a compelling theory of art.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Bradstreet had been wanting an opportunity to work with Lewis LaRosa after seeing his work on the Punisher Max Comics series, for which Bradstreet does the covers. LaRosa was planning to leave the comics industry, but was cajoled by Bradstreet and a signed headshot of Jane in the mail.The team had originally conceived the series as being twelve parts, but it was later changed to six parts.

Semi-autobiographical, it was the capstone to Shields's writing career: she died shortly after its publication in 2003. The work was widely acclaimed and nominated for the Booker Prize, the Giller Prize, the Governor General's Award, the Orange Prize for Fiction, and received the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize. In 2011, it was a finalist in the Canada Reads competition, where it was defended by actor Lorne Cardinal. Like many of her works (especially The Stone Diaries), Unless explores the extraordinary that lies within the ordinary lives of ordinary women.\nThe novel is narrated in first person by 44-year-old writer and translator, Reta Winters. The book proceeds as a linear series of reflections by Reta, elliptically coming to the thematic center of the story: the seemingly arbitrary decision of Reta's college-aged daughter Norah to drop out of university and live on the street with a cardboard sign affixed to her chest that reads \"Goodness\". Although the novel does not in any way proceed like a mystery, the reasons for Norah's departure from the normal world are Reta's primary motivation in writing. In parallel, her relationship with her French mentor (a Holocaust survivor and poet) drives much of her narration and view of herself.\nThe novel deals extensively with the role of women and in particular, women's literature. Late in the novel, Reta starts to break from herself and write in character as a disenfranchised female writer. The underlying theme is that the lives of women are underwritten, ignored, and dealt with as \"trivial\" by the literary establishment.\nThe novel also functions largely as an investigation into the role of writing in general (independent of gender). Reta's grief over her daughter's state makes her very inwardly focussed on the process of writing. A reflection of this is shown in the title of the book and the chapter titles. \"Unless\" and the chapter titles (\"therefore\", \"else\", \"instead\") are all words that are used to couch the fragmented manner in which life fits together. As Shields writes, \"A life is full of isolated events, but these events, if they are to form a coherent narrative, require odd pieces of language to link them together, little chips of grammar (mostly adverbs or prepositions) that are hard to define [...] words like therefore, else, other, also, thereof, therefore, instead, otherwise, despite, already, and not yet.\"\nThe novel was adapted into the 2016 film Unless, which stars Catherine Keener as Reta and Hannah Gross as Norah.On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Unless on its list of the 100 most influential novels.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_11460", "text": "Son is written in three parts, each with a subtitle: Before, Between, and Beyond.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She instead offers the respect of a daughter and is disowned by Lear who seeks flattery. Regan and Goneril subsequently break promises to host Lear and his entourage, so he opts to become homeless and destitute, goes insane, and the French King married to Cordelia invades Britain to restore order and Lear's rule.

After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music.\nHandel's reputation in England, where he had lived since 1712, had been established through his compositions of Italian opera. He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste; Messiah was his sixth work in this genre. Although its structure resembles that of opera, it is not in dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. Instead, Jennens's text is an extended reflection on Jesus as the Messiah called Christ. The text begins in Part I with prophecies by Isaiah and others, and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds, the only \"scene\" taken from the Gospels. In Part II, Handel concentrates on the Passion of Jesus and ends with the Hallelujah chorus. In Part III he covers Paul's teachings on the resurrection of the dead and Christ's glorification in heaven.\nHandel wrote Messiah for modest vocal and instrumental forces, with optional alternate settings for many of the individual numbers. In the years after his death, the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale, with giant orchestras and choirs. In other efforts to update it, its orchestration was revised and amplified, such as Mozart's Der Messias.

However, he considered their influence regrettable, writing that in For Marx and Reading Capital, Althusser's aim was to revitalize dialectical materialism \"as an ideology to mediate the widely discredited political practices of the French Communist Party.\" He accused Althusser of ignoring working class struggles in favor of an abstract \"science of history\", and noted that Althusser himself admitted that Reading Capital largely ignored the class struggle.William S. Lewis described Reading Capital as the culmination of the rereading of Marx that Althusser began in 1953. He considered it a theoretically sophisticated text. However, he suggested that the difficulty of the work supported the charge that Althusser aspired to \"Leninist vanguardism\" and wanted \"a small, theoretically sophisticated cadre\" to \"direct the revolution\", and expressed agreement with the historian Eric Hobsbawm's view that the book showed that Althusser was an \"extremely selective reader of Marx.\"The economist Alain Lipietz further pointed out that, while Reading Capital helped to disengage French Marxism from an oversimplification, determinism and mechanism inherited from the Stalinist period, it also obscured and censored the first chapter of Das Kapital, in which Marx analyzed the relationship of commodity and money.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She purchased a plantation near Jacksonville as a place for her son to recover from the injuries he had received as a Union soldier and to make a new start in life. After visiting him, she became so enamored with the region she purchased a cottage and orange grove for herself and wintered there until 1884, even though the plantation failed within its first year. Parts of Palmetto Leaves appeared in a newspaper published by Stowe's brother, as a series of letters and essays about life in northeast Florida.\nScion of New England clergy, Stowe keenly felt a sense of Christian responsibility that was expressed in her letters. She considered it her duty to help improve the lives of newly emancipated blacks and detailed her efforts to establish a school and church in Mandarin toward these ends. Parts of the book relate the lives of local African-Americans and the customs of their society. Stowe described the charm of the region and its generally moderate climate but warned readers of \"excessive\" heat in the summer months and occasional cold snaps in winter. Her audience comprises relatives, friends, and strangers in New England who ask her advice about whether or not to move to Florida, which at the time was still mostly wilderness.

The year following the publication of Palmetto Leaves, Stowe reported that 14,000 tourists had visited North Florida. Two years after its initial publication, a writer working for Harper's magazine noted that Stowe was \"besieged by hundreds of visitors, who do not seem to understand that she is not an exhibition\".Stowe's house, which was located on the bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats shuffling tourists from Jacksonville to Palatka or Green Cove Springs passed close by and slowed, so the captains could point out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so that visitors could come ashore and peek into the windows of the home. One, who dared to pull down a tree branch covered with orange blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less than high regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to pose for tourists.\nStowe was among several authors who wrote about Florida following the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something that may have been allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.\nUncle Tom's Cabin was clearly Stowe's magnum opus (although she considered Old Town Folks, which was written while she was in Mandarin, to have that designation), as Stowe family history recalls that Abraham Lincoln entertained the author during a visit to the White House, and greeted her by saying \"So this is the little lady who made this big war?\" Compared to it, Palmetto Leaves is considered a minor work and is rarely included in the canon of criticism about Stowe's writings. The Cambridge Introduction to Literature series on Stowe addresses it briefly, however, noting that the mixed essay and letter format make it \"uneven in quality and unstable in stance\". More assertive criticism was directed toward Stowe's portrayals of the local Mandarin blacks. Cambridge Introduction to Literature author Sarah Robbins called it \"downright offensive\" and declared that Stowe negated her own attempts to persuade her readers that emancipated slaves were industrious and could assist in rebuilding the South of their own volition by including unflattering descriptions of their physical features\u2014comparing Old Cudjo to a baboon, for example\u2014and writing that supervising and taking care of them was necessary. Susan Eacker agrees, writing that Stowe's views were representative of the majority of white Americans' ideas of where blacks should be in the social scheme of the New South.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "484_14416", "text": "Stowe remained active, attending speaking engagements, writing, traveling frequently and publishing several novels while she was wintering in Mandarin. Though she promised her publishers, J. R. Osgood, another novel, she instead compiled a series of articles about Florida and letters to relatives in New England about her daily life. Some of them were first published in Christian Union, a local New England newspaper established by her brother Henry Ward Beecher. In all, twenty chapters make up Palmetto Leaves that vary in tone depending upon Stowe's audience. \"Buying land in Florida\", \"Florida for Invalids\", and \"Our Experience in Crops\" are addressed more to general readers who may be considering moving to the region. Some essays are directed to describing the best sights in the area, such as \"Flowery January in Florida\", \"Picnicking up Julington\", \"The Grand Tour up River\", and \"St. Augustine\".  A more personal touch is included in chapters entitled \"A Letter to the Girls\", \"Letter-Writing\", and \"Our Neighbor Over the Way\" as Stowe includes intimate details about her daily life in Mandarin. Her observations of the state and characteristics of emancipated slaves are mentioned intermittently in letters and essays, but the final two chapters, \"Old Cudjo and The Angel\" and \"Laborers of The South\", are dedicated solely to this topic.\nPalmetto Leaves was not Stowe's first travel memoir. In 1854 she published Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands about her first trip to Europe, a book unique as an American woman's view of Europe. She followed this with Agnes of Sorrento that appeared as a serial in The Atlantic Monthly from 1861 to 1862. Source material for Agnes of Sorrento was culled from her observations of and experiences in Italy, collected during her third trip to Europe, which she took with her family. Olav Thulesius, author of Harriet Beecher Stowe in Florida, recognizes Stowe's tendency to spin everything she saw into something selectively positive. Stowe addressed this in the foreword to Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands, writing: If the criticism be made that every thing is given couleur de rose, the answer is, Why not? If there be characters and scenes that seem drawn with too bright a pencil, the reader will consider that, after all, there are many worse sins than disposition to think and speak well of one's neighbors. \nThe object of publishing these letters is, therefore, to give to those who are true-hearted and honest the same agreeable picture of life and manners which met the writer's own eyes.\nBecause little was known about the region, the elements of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, Palmetto Leaves\u2014published in 1873\u2014to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was still very much a rugged wilderness, Northerners really had no concept of what the region was like. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book Orange Blossoms, but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At the Eighth Congress of the International Napoleonic Society, Sammut gave a presentation, \"The Enlightenment in Malta and the Coming of Bonaparte\", based on his research for Bonaparte \u00e0 Malte.\nSammut maintained that Napoleon, despite spending such a short time in Malta, sought singlehandedly to draw the country into the modern world. He issued a series of decrees aimed at bringing about a thorough reorganization of government and society in Malta, and tirelessly sought to review the country's laws and regulations. The abolition of noble titles and privileges and the ending of slavery were the first measures he implemented. He ordered the expulsion of the Inquisitor and the release of the Order's political prisoners, including the Maltese patriot, Mikiel Anton Vassalli, who shared his Enlightenment ideals and whom he described as \"the most intelligent prisoner (ever) locked in a cell\". Voicing his surprise that fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics and astronomy were not yet being taught at the University of Malta, he also instituted a series of educational reforms.Sammut characterized Napoleon as \"a different kind of leader... more of an intellectual strategist and philosopher\", a quality placing him in the highest rank of commander together with Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great.Some of Sammut's research for Bonaparte \u00e0 Malte also went into his 1994 historical novel about Vassalli, Il-\u0126olma Maltija (The Maltese Dream), described by Alfred Sant as \"his masterpiece\" and by British author and poet Marjorie Boulton as \"a colossal work\".According to Prof. Anne-Marie M\u00e9sa of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Frans Sammut's \"point of view is actually original, well reasoned out, nuanced and subtle \u2013 as one would expect from all works on history.

Priest has used doubles before to great effect, in his award-winning novel The Prestige; but The Separation trumps even that tale. Its chapters linger in the mind like scenes from a Hitchcock film, impossible to shake off; like Hitchcock's work, The Separation begs for repeated readings to appreciate the cold brilliance and execution of its intricate plot fully. A masterly novel that deserves to become a classic.\"Publishers Weekly called it a \"subtle, unsettling alternative WWII history\": \"Convincingly detailed diaries, scraps of published texts, declassified transcripts and more baffle a historian who tries to reconcile different realities. The brothers themselves recognize the uncertainty of motives and actions; Joe in particular struggles to believe that he's making a better future even though he realizes how much it costs him personally. Many alternative history novels are bloodless extrapolations from mountains of data, but this one quietly builds characters you care about\u2014then leaves their dilemmas unresolved as they try to believe that what they have done is 'right'.\"Pauline Morgan, reviewing the novel for SF Crowsnest.com, said, \"This is a glorious book to read\u2014not for nothing was Christopher Priest included in the line-up of Britain's best young novelists some years ago.

It details a social scientific study of the ideological commitments of 'elite' journalists in the United States, and the consequences of those commitments on both the reporting itself and on its reception by the public. The book states that because of the political opinions of journalists, the elite media has a liberal media bias.\nOne of the stated aims of the books is to comprehend social changes in elite rule in the USA in continuation to the famous study of C W Mills, titled The Power Elites. The book progresses from the idea that few people of similar social backgrounds and family ties hold the command positions or key positions in the power structure. The Power Elites control top positions in the corporate, federal government, and military organisations. The Media Elite are emerging due to the expansion of national media networks and they are challenging the traditional elites of the American society.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_14731", "text": "The book is based on a survey, completed in 1980, of 238 journalists randomly selected from America's most influential news organizations: ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal.  Content analysis and audience reception studies were used to determine if deviations between the views held by journalists and those held by the general public had any effect on the way the news gets reported and the resulting beliefs held by the public.\nSome aspects of the methodology have been challenged, and the authors debated their critics in academic journals. Alleged problems with the methodology included: a low sample size; poor randomization; the failure to include media owners, managers, or editors in the samples; the inadequate use of proper polling techniques; the use of biased questions; point of view assertions by the studies authors that arbitrarily qualified some things as conservative or liberal; the failure to adequately measure the general public's attitudes; and poor statistical analysis of the results.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "484_14732", "text": "The survey revealed a group of individuals at once remarkably similar to one another in the background, status, and beliefs and strikingly different from the general public. In 1980, this \"media elite\" was predominantly white (95 percent), male (79 percent), college-educated (93 percent), and well paid. Four out of five had been raised in relatively affluent business or professional families; two out of three came from states in the Northeast or industrial Midwest.\nIn terms of beliefs, one distinctive characteristic was a strongly secular outlook. In marked contrast to a 1977 Gallup poll of the general population in which 94 percent of respondents professed a religious faith, 50 percent of the elite journalists listed their religion as \"none.\" And while 86 percent of respondents from the general population said their religious beliefs are very or fairly important to them (and 42 percent had attended a religious service in the preceding week), an identical 86 percent of elite journalists said they seldom or never go to church.\nConcerning political beliefs: 54 percent of the journalists described their views as left of center, 29 percent as \"middle of the road,\" and only 17 percent as right of center. The authors argue that this ratio of more than three liberal journalists for each conservative contrasts sharply with the distribution among the American public: every relevant poll conducted in the decade from 1975 to 1985 found conservatives outnumbering liberals in the electorate, often by a ratio of three to two or more.\nOf course, partisan or ideological labels provide only a very rough indication of political orientation. Thus one of the great strengths of the Media Elite survey is that it also included several sets of more precise questions about political attitudes and behaviors. One set asked how the journalists had voted in each of the last four presidential elections (i.e., 1964\u201376). It produced what is now probably the most frequently quoted datum in the media bias debate: Among elite journalists who voted for a major party candidate, support for the more liberal Democratic contender ranged from 81 percent for George McGovern and Jimmy Carter, to 87 percent for Hubert Humphrey, to a high of 94 percent for Lyndon B. Johnson.\nAn additional set of questions elicited attitudes on 21 economic, political, and social issues. The responses showed little support for egalitarian socialist economics but strong endorsement of liberal social views in such areas as welfare, affirmative action, environmentalism, and, in particular, individual morality. For example, only 13 percent of the journalists agreed that large private corporations should be nationalized, while 86 percent endorsed the statement that \"people with more ability should earn higher salaries.\" Similarly, fully 90 percent agreed that \"it is a woman's right to decide whether or not to have an abortion,\" while only 25 percent agreed that homosexual sex is \"wrong.\" Fewer than half (47 percent) agreed that adultery is wrong.\nThe authors also sought to provide insight into the future by conducting a separate survey of students at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, a principal training ground for prospective members of the media elite. They found that while the students were more diverse in race and gender than the existing elite they were even more homogeneous in background and beliefs. In particular, self-described liberals outnumbered conservatives 85 percent to 11 percent, a ratio of almost eight to one.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Secondly, Kitty Pryde was \"Chris' [Claremont] baby\", and Claremont was eager to develop this character further. Thirdly, Milgrom himself saw this as a unique chance to work with Marvel Comics legend Claremont.Claremont then wrote a story in which he could bring in new angles on the two characters. Kitty Pryde \u2014 previously little more than a sweet and innocent \"kid sister\" for the older X-Men, a literary foil to provide light-hearted moments \u2014 was portrayed as troubled with \"teenager self-doubt and self-deprecation\", \"searching for her very soul\" and going through the coming of age. Wolverine was put into the honor-driven, mystical Japanese culture, in which he was no longer the X-Men's campy hardman but \"grim and gritty\".To express the atypically dark and personal story, Milgrom also adapted his drawing style, using bolder, darker and more dynamic strokes. In the end, he was very satisfied with the project.In six issues, writer Chris Claremont takes Kitty Pryde fresh from her breakup with Colossus in Uncanny X-Men #183 and puts her through a trial of fire in which she confronts her inner demons and emerges victorious. Claremont also plays off the contrast between Kitty and the battle-hardened Wolverine, and the two very different characters establish a platonic, brother-and-sister-like rapport (beginning a tradition of sorts for Wolverine and young female sidekicks).  A testament to his newfound esteem for her character, Wolverine would even consider Kitty as a potential leader for the X-Men, were it not for her sheer youth, in later issues of the regular series.\nKitty Pryde and Wolverine is also responsible for establishing Kitty's superhero image, finally settling on a costume which she would wear into the early 1990s, and choosing the codename \"Shadowcat\" (having previously flitted between \"Ariel\" and \"Sprite\"), which she took on after this adventure and has held on until today.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The first advertisement appeared on 17 December 1817. The Austen family retained copyright of the 1,750 copies, which sold rapidly. The later editions of both were published separately.\nThe book's title is not Jane Austen's but her brother Henry's, who named it after her early death. There is no known source that documents what Austen intended to call her novel.

The wife's brother, Captain Frederick Wentworth, was engaged to Anne in 1806, but the engagement was broken when Anne was persuaded by her friends and family to end their relationship. Anne and Captain Wentworth, both single and unattached, meet again after a separation lasting almost eight years, setting the scene for a second, well-considered chance at love and marriage for Anne.\nThe novel was well received in the early 19th century, but its greater fame came later in the century and continued into the 20th and 21st centuries. Much scholarly debate on Austen's work has since been published. Anne Elliot is noteworthy among Austen's heroines for her relative maturity. As Persuasion was Austen's last completed work, it is accepted as her most maturely written novel, showing a refinement of literary conception indicative of a woman approaching 40 years of age.

Almost all of Austen's novels were written in the form of first drafts (now lost) from before 1800, over a decade before their first publication in the last years of Austen's life. Since Persuasion was written over such a narrow time frame, Litz was able to locate and publish Austen's early handwritten drafts as she refined the text of the novel into its final published form. Persuasion is unique among Austen's novels in allowing such a close inspection, as recorded by Litz, of her editorial prowess in revising and enhancing early drafts of her own writing. Litz, citing the research of Norman Page, gives an example of Austen's meticulous editing by excerpting a passage of Austen's cancelled Chapter Ten of the novel and comparing it to the revised version. In its original version, the manuscript stated:\n\n[Wentworth] found that he was considered by his friend Harville an engaged man. The Harvilles entertained not a doubt of a mutual attachment between him and Louisa; and though this to a degree was contradicted instantly, it yet made him feel that perhaps by her family, by everybody, by herself even, the same idea might be held, and that he was not free in honour, though if such were to be the conclusion, too free alas! in heart. He had never thought justly on this subject before, and he had not sufficiently considered that his excessive intimacy at Uppercross must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that while trying whether he could attach himself to either of the girls, he might be exciting unpleasant reports if not raising unrequited regard./ He found too late that he had entangled himself, (cancelled version, as published in Chapman's edition of Austen).\nLitz then gives the final version by Austen:\n\n\"I found\", said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man! That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment. I was startled and shocked. To a degree, I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same\u2014her own family, nay, perhaps herself, I was no longer at my own disposal. I was hers in honour if she wished it. I had been unguarded. I had not thought seriously on this subject before. I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill effects. I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences\"./ He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself (final version).\nTo this may be added the surviving version of Austen's handwritten copy of the original draft before the editing process outlined above had even started where Austen wrote it in the following nascent form:\n\nHe found that he was considered by his friend Harville, as an engaged Man.

Publishers Weekly also stated in its review of Dragon War that \"readers new to the series may be confused by the characters' sketchy introductions and the complexity of past events alluded to but never clarified\".

Yep had already written several books including the Newbery Honor novel Dragonwings by 1980, when, after undertaking careful research, he decided to adapt Chinese mythology into a fantasy form, something he had always wanted to do since he had sold his first science fiction story at 18. He \"tried to stay true to the spirit\" of these myths, but did not try \"to keep their exact details\". The \"perfect vehicle\" he chose was a folktale in which the Monkey King captured a river spirit who had flooded an entire city, which he at first tried to conceive in picture book form. However, he kept questioning the motivations of the river spirit, whom he had renamed Civet. This resulted in the realization, as his outline ballooned exponentially from eight to 800 pages, that he would need a series as opposed to just one book to tell her story.\nThe story then evolved into one in which the Monkey King pursued Civet into \"our reality\", resulting in \"several normal children from our universe\" being taken back into theirs. Yep had completed several drafts of this version when \"toward the end of that version there was a special pair - a dragon and her boy - who stole the scene whenever they were on stage\". He realized that he had to nearly start over, this time structuring the story around these two, who became Shimmer and Thorn. This proved to be just the start, as Yep continued to incorporate more material and mythology into the later books based on further research and inspiration. Part of the process involved changing the narration from Shimmer to the Monkey King with the third book, Dragon Cauldron. Yep has said of Shimmer that he had \"never written about a character quite so independent, even demanding\".Yep wrote the series over a twelve-year period. It is likely that he wrote each book at the same time he was writing others including his autobiography, as he frequently writes several books simultaneously, but in different genres as he often gets writer's block. Dragon of the Lost Sea for example, was written at the same time that he wrote The Mark Twain Murders. During this time, Yep's being able to settle into his characters such as Shimmer, who has been described as \"opinionated, arrogant, and has a quick temper that sometimes makes it very difficult to be her friend\", created some strain with his wife, fellow author Joanne Ryder, as at times the \"dragon\" in him would emerge.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_12406", "text": "The book hit the bestseller lists for Locus, Waldenbooks, and B.

Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. Wilson was not directly involved in writing the Principia.\n\nNotable symbols in the book include the Apple of Discord, the pentagon, and the \"Sacred Chao\", which resembles the Taijitu of Taoism, but the two principles depicted are \"Hodge\" and \"Podge\" rather than yin and yang, and they are represented by the apple and the pentagon, and not by dots. Saints identified include Emperor Norton, Yossarian, Don Quixote, and Bokonon.  The Principia also introduces the mysterious word \"fnord\", later popularized in The Illuminatus! Trilogy; the trilogy itself is mentioned in the afterword to the Loompanics edition, and in the various introductions to the fifth editions.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "484_15031", "text": "The Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost was first published in a limited edition of five copies and released into the public domain in 1965.

In an interview with researcher Brenton Clutterbuck, Gorightly said he had been given Greg Hill's copy of the first edition. This appeared in its entirety in Historia Discordia, a book on Discordian history released in spring of 2014. In 2015 Gorightly stated that he now believed that the copy in the JFK collection was an earlier draft of the Principia Discordia predating the first edition.The Principia includes a notice which purports to disclaim any copyright in relation to the work: \"\u24c0 All Rites Reversed \u2013 reprint what you like.\"  Regardless of the legal effect of this notice, the Principia has been widely disseminated in the public domain via the Internet and more traditional print publishers.

The stories, centred on positronic robots, are all part of the Robot series, most of which take place in the Foundation universe. Another collection of short stories about robots, I, Robot, was re-published in the previous year, which is why Asimov chose to title the collection as The Rest of the Robots. None of the short stories in this collection were in I, Robot, however all of them were later included in The Complete Robot, and both novels about Elijah Baley were also published separately.\nThe texts in the collection were grouped into four chapters, differentiating their central themes. The first chapter, \"The Coming of the Robots\", included some of Asimov's earliest robot stories, where the Three Laws of Robotics were not yet explicitly defined.\nThe following chapter, \"The Laws of Robotics\", included stories that were written after the explicit formulation of the three laws, however both stories include elements that place them outside the Foundation universe. In the story \"First Law\", aliens and direct disobedience of the First Law of Robotics are described, while in the other story, \"Let's Get Together\", robots are used as weapons in the Cold War. The story \"Victory Unintentional\" in the first chapter also falls outside the Foundation canon, due to the mention of aliens.\nThe third chapter, \"Susan Calvin\" includes stories where robopsychologist Dr. Susan Calvin makes an appearance. These four stories are representative of Asimov's robot short stories, following his traditional themes of aversion and distrust of robots by the general public and issues arising from the robots' interpretation of the Three Laws. The final chapter, titled \"Lije Baley\", consists of the two novels with detective Elijah Baley, whom Asimov affectionately calls Lije.\nWhile the original hardcover edition of this book included the two novels, some paperback editions have included only the eight short stories.

It became his first major success, and a hallmark of Russian social realism. The play depicts a group of impoverished Russians living in a shelter near the Volga.\nWhen it first appeared, The Lower Depths was criticized for its pessimism and ambiguous ethical message. The presentation of the lower classes was viewed as overly dark and unredemptive, and Gorky was clearly more interested in creating memorable characters than in advancing a formal plot.

Barnett said that it \"often reaches the greatness\" of Primo Levi's works about the Holocaust.Several reviewers commented on how difficult it is to read the detailed TRC testimony of victims of human rights abuses, and Nicole Devarenne of the London Review of Books suggested that Krog's personal suffering over the course of the book is supposed to appear \"redemptive\": when Krog finds unity with her countrymen (especially her non-white countrymen), it is because she suffers alongside them. In this regard, Krog's approach was controversial. Reviews discussed \"the danger of appropriation\" in respect of the stories of the victims of human rights abuses.

It explores the complexities of truth and illusion through the story of a family torn apart by secrets and the intrusion of an idealistic outsider. It focuses on the Ekdal family, whose fragile peace is shattered by Gregers Werle, an idealist who insists on exposing hidden truths, leading to tragic consequences. The play was written in a realistic style, but literary scholars have pointed out the play's kinship with symbolism. It blends themes such as deception, betrayal, and the disillusionment of modern life with moments of comedy and satire, and is considered the first modern masterpiece in the genre of tragicomedy. The Wild Duck and Rosmersholm are \"often to be observed in the critics' estimates vying with each other as rivals for the top place among Ibsen's works\".Themes of visibility and recognition permeate the narrative, featuring characters struggling to be seen while metaphorically and literally blind to each other's true selves, symbolized through motifs such as blindness, photography, and the wounded wild duck. Like other Ibsen plays, it is rich in references to Ibsen's family, with \"Old Ekdal\" widely considered one of the most famous literary portraits of the playwright's father Knud Ibsen.

The American version was published in 1918, with an English language edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto & Windus in 1928.Set in the Bohemianism milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women and various art and social situations.\nThe novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regards\u2014especially in its English form\u2014as a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Lewis will later clarify that there \"is laughter and laughter. That of true satire is as it were tragic laughter\". Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel.

The next year, the book was translated into Russian and published in Moscow, along with Cacau, his second work. Sweat is directly linked to the author's personal experience. In 1928, at just sixteen, he took a small room in the Pelourinho (in Salvador, Bahia), where he could witness the daily lives of the men and women forced to live in cramped conditions. \nIn a Postface to his book, Captains of the Sands, Amado wrote that Sweat was the third work in the six-novel cycle he called \"The Bahian Novels\" in which he had tried to set down the \"life, the customs, the language of my State\". He described Sweat as exposing \"the most failed aspect of the State, creatures who have already lost everything and expect nothing more from life\". Amado writes that he had the action take place \"in one of those strange tenements on the Ladeiro do Pelourinho\" in Salvador and he did it with an aim, not only because he had met most of the characters in one of those tenements, where he had himself lived, but as much because it seemed to him that only in that environment could the novel take on a tone of revolt in the face of their anguish and misery. In Amado's own words, Sweat and Cacau together form the portfolio of an \u201capprentice novelist\u201d. The novel features concerns that would be returned to in his later works.", "hasanswer": false}]}
