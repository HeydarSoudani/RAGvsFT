But it was English politician Charles Latrobe who really penned the following: \"... look at their works: the moles, aqueducts, churches, roads\u2014and the luxurious City of Palaces which has risen from the clay-built ruins of Tenochtitlan...\", on page 84 of the Letter V of The Rambler in Mexico.During the colonial period, the city's motto was \"Muy Noble e Insigne, Muy Leal e Imperial\" (Very Noble and Distinguished, Very Loyal and Imperial). During Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's administration a political slogan was introduced: la Ciudad de la Esperanza (lit.\u2009'The City of Hope'). This motto was quickly adopted as a city nickname but has faded since the new motto, Capital en Movimiento (\"Capital in Movement\"), was adopted by the administration headed by Marcelo Ebrard, though the latter is not treated as often as a nickname in media. \nUp until 2013, it was common to refer to the city by the initialism \n\"DF\" from \"Distrito Federal de M\u00e9xico\". Since 2013, the abbreviation \"CDMX\" (Ciudad de M\u00e9xico) has been more common, particularly in relation to government campaigns.\nThe city is colloquially known as Chilangolandia after the locals' nickname chilangos.

The two met in 1964 when they performed together in the Off-Broadway flop Hang Down Your Head and Die, and they began writing Hair together in late 1964.  The main characters were autobiographical, with Rado's Claude being a pensive romantic and Ragni's Berger an extrovert.  Their close relationship, including its volatility, was reflected in the musical.  Rado explained, \"We were great friends.  It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity, into writing, into creating this piece.  We put the drama between us on stage.\"Rado described the inspiration for Hair as \"a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long\".  He recalled, \"There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful. ... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [and] let our hair grow.\"  Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. Rado said, \"It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples.  You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. We thought, 'This is happening in the streets', and we wanted to bring it to the stage.\" According to Rado's obituary in The New York Times, the title was inspired by \"a museum stroll in mid-1965, [when he and Ragni saw] a painting of a tuft of hair by the Pop artist Jim Dine. Its title was 'Hair'.\"Rado and Ragni came from different artistic backgrounds. In college, Rado wrote musical revues and aspired to be a Broadway composer in the Rodgers and Hammerstein tradition.  He went on to study acting with Lee Strasberg.  Ragni, on the other hand, was an active member of The Open Theater, one of several groups, mostly Off-off Broadway, that were developing experimental theatre techniques.  He introduced Rado to the modern theatre styles and methods being developed at The Open Theater.  In 1966, while the two were developing Hair, Ragni performed in The Open Theater's production of Megan Terry's play Viet Rock, a story about young men being deployed to the Vietnam War. In addition to the war theme, Viet Rock employed the improvisational exercises being used in the experimental theatre scene and later used in the development of Hair.Rado and Ragni brought their drafts of the show to producer Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition \"African Waltz\" (recorded by Cannonball Adderley).  The composer's lifestyle was in marked contrast to his co-creators: \"I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and I lived on Staten Island.\"  \"I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni.\"  But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show.  \"We work independently\", explained MacDermot in May 1968.  \"I prefer it that way.  They hand me the material.  I set it to music.\"  MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with the songs \"I Got Life\", \"Ain't Got No\", \"Where Do I Go\" and the title song.

Anh. 222/19b, was probably written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in early 1765 in London. It is one of the twelve symphonies that Ludwig von K\u00f6chel only knew by its incipit in the Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel manuscript catalogue (p. 10, No. 68), which listed it as one of six symphonies (Nos. 65\u201370) sourced from Luigi Gatti (1740\u20131817), Court Kapellmeister in Salzburg from around 1782:\n\nThe instrumentation for the symphony is unknown, but Alfred Einstein speculated that it would have been the same as the contemporary known symphonies K. 16 and K. 19 (strings, 2 oboes, and 2 horns). In his third edition of the K\u00f6chel catalogue, he dated it to early 1765 in London, and opined that the incipit showed the influence of J. C. Bach's symphonies. His remarks were copied unchanged by the sixth edition of the K\u00f6chel catalogue. Neal Zaslaw agreed that the opening was characteristic of J. C. Bach in his book Mozart's Symphonies, but questioned if this was a legitimate method of dating works, given that the seven symphonies of J. C. Bach beginning in this march-like way were written later than Mozart's stay in London, that Mozart himself used similar openings in later works (e.g. in the twenty-sixth symphony, K. 184/161a), and that this style of opening was much used by other composers as well in the period. Thus he opines that a stylistical analysis cannot credibly be performed until the work is rediscovered.\nNevertheless, the wrapper used for the set of parts to enclose the K. 19 symphony in D had been used previously for a symphony in F (K. 19a) and then one in C (possibly K. 19b), as can be seen from the deletions and insertions on the title page, which suggested to Zaslaw that Mozart had written a C major symphony before K. 19 and that K. 19b should receive a lower K\u00f6chel number. Stephen Fischer however pointed out in his 1995 review of Zaslaw's book that the scores were parts rather than full scores, thus not constituting solid evidence for such a chronology. He also speculates that K. 19b may have been the symphony Maria Anna Mozart referred to when she remembered Wolfgang having \"composed his first symphony with all the instruments of the orchestra, especially Trumpets and Kettledrums\" when Leopold was dangerously ill. K. 16, though traditionally numbered as the first symphony, does not have this instrumentation: thus a lost work must be referred to. Though Zaslaw identified it with a possible E\u266d major symphony (\"No. 0\") possibly derived from pieces in the London Sketchbook (K. 15a\u201315ss), Fischer believed that the use of trumpets and timpani would be more likely for a C major symphony like K. 19b. Though the wrapper for K. 19 does not mention trumpets nor timpani, he notes that the set of parts was originally for an F-major symphony (K. 19a) and that Leopold may not have deemed it necessary to change the list of parts.\nThe authenticity of this symphony is more credibly shown by the source attribution to Gatti in the Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel manuscript catalogue, making it plausible that it was among the six sent to Donaueschingen by Leopold Mozart in 1767.", "hasanswer": true}]}

When the two protagonists initiate a conversation that depicts their first meeting as rivals, the track adds a pulsing beat and a countermelody of cello strings before the chorus kicks in. Similar to McCartney and Jackson's \"The Girl Is Mine\", Jerkins and his team structured \"The Boy Is Mine\" with spaces.

Written in the key of C\u266f minor, it follows a chord progression of F\u266fm9\u2013C\u266fm9, and the vocals span from G\u266f3 to F\u266f4. The song's lyrics chronicle a catfight between two young women who try to convince each other that they are the object of a man's affection.

He composed the Carmen de Hastingae Proelio, a celebration of the Norman victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.\nAlthough the genealogy of early Ponthieu and Boulogne is scanty (and the 12th century versions unreliable, because of their efforts to tie the ruling houses of Boulogne and Ponthieu into earlier noble houses), it is most likely that Guy, the Bishop of Amiens, was the uncle (and not the brother) of Enguerrand II and his brother Guy I of Ponthieu. Count Enguerrand II's and Guy I's father Hugh II was the son of Enguerrand I by an earlier marriage: Enguerrand I evidently married a Boulognnais countess, the wife of Arnold II, who died in battle: from this later marriage came Guy and his brother Fulk (later abbot of Forest l'Abbaye), and probably a Robert.\nBishop Guy was educated for a career in the church at the abbey of St Riquier and was one of its most brilliant students. His teacher was abbot Enguerrand (called \"the wise\" d. 9 December 1045). Guy may have been an archdeacon by 1045, and was bishop by 1058. \"His predecessor to the episcopate of Amiens, Fulk II, was caught up in the emerging struggle between the secular clergy, dominated by the political contentions of the great feudal families, and the reforming popes, with their bias in favour of monastic houses, which they often rendered exempt from episcopal jurisdiction.\" When Guy became bishop of Amiens he inherited the legal struggles of his predecessor; this eventually resulted in Guy being suspended from his duties as bishop, although he continued to rule the see as lord.\nHe was in this state of papal disfavour at the time of the Norman Conquest. This may have been the (contributing) reason why bishop Guy composed the Carmen de Hastingae Proelio (\"Song of the Battle of Hastings\"), as an effort to flatter the new Norman king of England, William I, who was then in very high favor with the pope. But if so, bishop Guy's poem failed in its purpose. He was highly enough thought of at the Norman court to be assigned as Matilda of Flanders's chaplain when she went over to England for her coronation in 1068.

Ultimately, BioWare wanted the third Dragon Age game to combine the elements of the first two games in the series. Having begun development in 2011, BioWare used EA DICE's Frostbite 3 engine to power the game, though this created many development challenges for the team. They had to crunch extensively during development, and because of hardware limitations on older generation consoles several gameplay features had to be cut.

The game takes place over the course of a week, and consists of the player reading the story, occasionally making choices that affect the direction of the plot; on the sixth day, one of the characters dies, and the game moves back in time to the beginning, letting the player use knowledge from the first set of six days to make new choices, to try to prevent the death.\nThe game was directed by Takumi Nakazawa, planned and written by Kotaro Uchikoshi, and composed for by Takeshi Abo. Uchikoshi included science fiction elements, but was unable to make heavy use of them, as his superiors at KID thought that the game needed to focus on cute female characters in order to perform well commercially. Abo composed music based on his first impressions of reading the game's story, with a focus on its \"emotional flow\". Because of the science fiction and theoretical themes, he composed what he describes as \"geometric music\".\nRPGFan praised the game for its plot, its intimate scope, and its music, whereas Famitsu found the game's mood boring.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 100% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Neon Genesis Evangelion, both a cultural touchstone for Japan and an uncompromising auteurist vision by creator Hideaki Anno, doubles as an enthralling apex for the mecha anime genre and as a harrowing exploration of depression \u2013 making for a wholly singular epic about angels and inner demons.\" Paste, IGN, and Comic Book Resources have named it as one of the best anime series of all time.The \"richness\" of the characters and \"complex and layered\" narrative has received praise by critics. In 1998, Max Autohead of Hyper rated it 10 out of 10, praising the \"brilliant and fantastic storyline, with amazing characters who pull you not only into their world, but into their psyche as well\". The same year, Shidoshi of GameFan magazine gave it an A rating, calling it an \"awesome\" series. Mike Hale of The New York Times described it in 2009 as \"a superior anime, a giant-robot tale of unusual depth, feeling and detail.\"Following the conclusion of the series' original television broadcast, the public and critical reception to Neon Genesis Evangelion was polarized, particularly with regard to the final two episodes. The experimental style of the finale confused or alienated many fans and spawned debate and controversy; the criticism was largely directed toward the lack of storyline resolution in the final two episodes. Opinion on the finale was mixed, with the audience broadly divided between those who considered the episodes \"deep\", and those who felt their meaning was \"more apparent than real\". The English voice actors admitted that they also had trouble understanding the series' conclusion. The Mainichi Times wrote that broadcast of the penultimate episode, \"nearly all viewers felt betrayed ... When commentator Eiji \u014ctsuka sent a letter to the Yomiuri Shimbun, complaining about the end of the Evangelion series, the debate went nationwide.\" Despite the criticism, Anno stood by his artistic choices for the series' conclusion. Critic Zac Bertschy remarked in 2003 that \"Most of the backlash against Evangelion existed because people don't like to think\". The initial controversy surrounding the end of Evangelion has had no lasting negative influence on the popularity of the series.Evangelion has developed into a social phenomenon beyond its primary fan base, generating national discussion in Japan. The series has also been the subject of numerous media reports, debates, and research studies worldwide. The show has received review by critics, academics and sociologists alike, including by Susan J. Napier, William Rout, Mick Broderick, Mari Kotani, Shinji Miyadai, Hiroki Azuma, Yuriko Furuhata, and Marc Steinberg. The series has been described as both a critique and deconstruction of the mecha genre. Japanese critic Manabu Tsuribe considered that Evangelion was \"extremely interior and is lacking in sociality, so that it seems to reflect pathology of the times.\" Anime News Network's Martin Theron described the character design as \"distinctive, designed to be sexy rather than cutesy\", and the mecha designs as \"among the most distinctive ever produced for an anime series, with sleek, lithe appearances that look monstrous, fearsome, and nimble rather than boxy and knight-like\". Mike Crandol stated \"It no longer seems contrite to say that Evangelion is surely one of the all-time great works of animation\".

The stage premiere, conducted by Samuil Samosud, took place at the Maly Operny Theatre in Leningrad on 18 January 1930.

The creative team had originally believed that the Beast saving Belle from the wolves was enough to justify the dance sequence near the end of the film, though later realised they had in fact not yet earned this moment; this quiet song where Beast gives Belle his library was pitched and written by Howard Ashman and \"as soon as that was written, we knew the movie was going to work\".In his biography I'm Not Dead... Yet!, actor Robby Benson, voice of the Beast, revealed that it was co-star Paige O'Hara's idea to have Benson's character duet with O'Hara's Belle in \"Something There\". According to Benson, the actress \"explained to Ashman and Menken that [Benson] had made records and sang in Broadway musicals.\" O'Hara briefly struggled to record one of the song's lines \u2013 \"a bit alarming\" \u2013 to which an ailing Ashman, who was forced to communicate with O'Hara and the studio via telephone from his hospital bed in New York due to his illness, simply responded \"Streisand.\" By this, Ashman meant that he wanted O'Hara to impersonate singer and actress Barbra Streisand, and by doing so O'Hara finally recorded the song successfully. \"Something There\" was recorded by O'Hara and Benson accompanied by a live orchestra.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In May, during the Montreal portion of the bed-in, counterculture figures from across North America visited Lennon, including American psychologist Timothy Leary, an early advocate of LSD, whom Lennon admired. Leary intended to run for Governor of California in the following year's election and asked Lennon to write him a campaign song based on the campaign's slogan, \"Come Together \u2013 Join the Party!\" The resulting chant was only a line long: \"Come together and join the party\". Lennon promised to finish and record the song, and Leary later recalled Lennon giving him a tape of the piece, but the two did not interact again.In July 1969, during sessions for the Beatles' album Abbey Road, Lennon used the phrase \"come together\" from the Leary campaign song to compose a new song for the album. Based on the 1956 single \"You Can't Catch Me\" by American guitarist Chuck Berry, the composition began as an up-tempo blues number, only slightly altering Berry's original lyric of \"Here come a flattop / He was movin' up with me\" to \"Here come ol' flattop / He come groovin' up slowly\". Lennon further incorporated the phrase \"shoot me\" from his unfinished and unreleased January 1969 song, \"Watching Rainbows\". The lyrics were inspired by his relationship with Ono, and were delivered quickly, as in the Berry song. Author Peter Doggett wrote that \"each phrase [passes] too quickly to be understood at first hearing, the sound as important as the meaning\".When Lennon presented the composition to his bandmates, his songwriting partner Paul McCartney noticed its similarity to \"You Can't Catch Me\" and recommended they slow it in tempo to reduce the resemblance. Beatles historian Jonathan Gould has suggested that the song has only a single \"pariah-like protagonist\" and Lennon was \"painting another sardonic self-portrait\". In a December 1987 interview by Selina Scott on the television show West 57th Street, George Harrison stated that he wrote two lines of the song.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_78", "question": "Who was the composer of Harp Concerto?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9615", "text": "Mozart wrote the concerto in April 1778, during his seven-month sojourn in Paris. It was commissioned by Adrien-Louis de Bonni\u00e8res, duc de Gu\u00eenes (1735\u20131806), a flutist, for his use and for that of his eldest daughter, Marie-Louise-Philippine (1759\u20131796), a harpist, who was taking composition lessons from the composer, at the duke's home, the H\u00f4tel de Castries. Mozart stated in a letter to his father that he thought the duke played the flute \"extremely well\" and that Marie's playing of the harp was \"magnifique\". As a composition student, however, Mozart found Marie thoroughly inept. The duke (until 1776, the comte de Guines), an aristocrat Mozart came to despise, never paid the composer for this work, and Mozart instead was offered only half the expected fee for the lessons, through de Guines' housekeeper. But he refused it. (For his tutoring, Mozart was owed six Louis d'or.) Little is known of the work's early performance history, though it seems probable that father and daughter played it first.In the classical period, the harp was still in development, and was not considered a standard orchestral instrument. It was regarded more as a plucked piano. Therefore, harp and flute was considered an extremely unusual combination. Currently, there is much more repertoire for a flute and harp duo, especially without orchestra. Much of this repertoire was written by composers in the nineteenth century. Mozart's opinion of the harp, however, was perhaps dubious at best, for he never wrote another piece that employed it.\nMozart quite likely composed this work with the duke's and his daughter's particular musical abilities in mind. He probably composed the majority of this concerto at the home of Joseph Legros, the director of the Concert Spirituel. Monsieur Legros had given Mozart the use of his keyboard in his home so that he could compose. (Mozart perhaps also composed part of the concerto at his second Paris apartment where he stayed with his mother, which was on the rue du Gros Chenet.)\nThe piece is essentially in the form of a Sinfonia Concertante, which was extremely popular in Paris at the time. Today, the concerto is often played by chamber ensembles, because it is technically and elegantly challenging for both the solo instruments it calls for. It is also often played by orchestras to display the talents of their own flutists and harpists.\nThe harp part appears to be more like an adaptation of a piano piece than an original harp part; this is especially evident in the patterns of five and ten notes throughout all three movements which would not fall under the fingers as easily for a harpist, as the fifth fingers are typically not used, though they were considered part of early harp technique. There are no full, rich glissandi, and although there is counterpoint in the harp part, it does not typically include lush chords. Mozart did not include any cadenzas of his own, as is normal for his compositions. Alfred Einstein claims that Mozart's cadenzas for this work were lost. A few popular cadenzas are often performed, such as those by Carl Reinecke, but many flutists and harpists have chosen to write their own. Andr\u00e9 Previn has also written cadenzas for this piece.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_85", "question": "Who was the composer of flOw?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_6378", "text": "Flow was originally developed as part of Jenova Chen's master's thesis for the Interactive Media Program at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts. His thesis was on the concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA), wherein a game adjusts its reactions to a player based on the past and present actions of that player. He illustrated his ideas with Flow, which he created in collaboration with Nicholas Clark. Chen implemented DDA by causing the player to change the game's difficulty subconsciously; he allowed players to dive between planes at will and provided the option of eating or not eating any creature. Players may decide to rush downwards or to grow stronger before attacking powerful opponents. Chen described Flow as \"a simple game. It's the simplest test of active DDA.\" Another influence on the game was psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's work on flow, wherein a person fully immerses themselves in an activity and gains a feeling of energized focus. To achieve this state, the person or player must have control over the activity; Chen believed that his DDA theory gave players the control necessary to achieve flow while playing.The game was released in March 2006, after two months of development\u2014during which Chen and Clark taught themselves Flash programming. The game's source code was later released in 2009. The game's score was composed by Austin Wintory. A PlayStation 3 version was announced for the PlayStation Store in May of that year, and was released in February 2007. Chen had graduated by that point, and had founded Thatgamecompany, which handled the conversion to the PlayStation 3; Nicholas Clark was one of the employees and served as the game version's designer. Impressed by Flow, Sony provided Thatgamecompany with finances, supplies, and additional staff, and offered them a three-game contract; the PlayStation 3 version of Flow was the first of these. Chen originally believed the conversion could be completed in four months and that it would be ready for the November 2006 launch of the PlayStation Network. However, when it was finally released in February 2007, it did not include \"half of the original design\".A version for the PlayStation Portable, developed by SuperVillain Studios, was released in March 2008. The company coded it from scratch, as the PlayStation 3 version's code and art were too platform-specific to reuse. The add-on pack for the PlayStation 3 version was also developed by SuperVillain. Thatgamecompany was not involved in the development of either project beyond a design influence and art direction role, as they were creating their next title, Flower. SuperVillain Studios later created ports of the PlayStation 3 version for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, which were published in November 2013 to correspond with the release of the PlayStation 4.

At Metacritic, the game holds an 86/100 score based on 56 critic reviews.Emily Morganti for Adventure Gamers commented that Gone Home had a \"realistic, engrossing story that's beautifully told through environmental clues and audio narration\" and that \"many people read books for the opportunity to see life through someone else\u2019s eyes, but it\u2019s rare for a game to do it as well as this one does.\" The Financial Post's Matthew Braga also noted that \"This is a game that some will hold up as forward-thinking evidence in the ongoing debate of games-as-art\", adding that the game was made to \"plumb the depths of experience outside of gaming's typically targeted white, male, youthful core.\" However, Eurogamer editor Oli Welsh stated \"The Fullbright Company has built a fine house for intimate storytelling in games, but it hasn't found the story to live in it yet.\"The game's LGBT themes were praised. Fullbright reported receiving numerous feedback not only from LGBT players of the game that appreciated how they told the story and how such people have to do deal with rejection by their family, but also from players who had opposed LGBT rights who found the game presented the issues related to LGBT to change their mind on the subject. Fullbright also received some criticism from players from focusing on LGBT themes at the expense of other story elements. Due to statements made by the organizers of PAX Prime that Fulbright considered derogatory towards LGBT, the company pulled out of showing Gone Home at the Indie MEGABOOTH showcase during the 2013 PAX Prime event, stressing the importance of respecting LGBT issues. In the wake of this, PAX announced that it would establish Diversity Hubs at its future events for \"attendees to find information related to issues surrounding women, LGBTQ, people of color, disabled people, and mental health issues in gaming\".Some reporters have considered the question of whether Gone Home should be considered a video game, as it lacks the normal interactivity one would normally have with a video game. Gaynor asserted that Gone Home was specifically developed for the video game medium, stating that they considered it an \"edited discussion\" between Fullbright and the player, as \"[t]he content that you encounter appears differently than for someone else. It is unique to each user and their interpretation. The interactivity of it makes the experience unique to yourself.\" Gaynor used the example of the ability to turn lights on or off in any room in the house as an example of this. They included this interactivity as they had developed the game, they found that this gave a means for players to track if they had been within a room before or not, since the house starts otherwise dark, so he considered this one method by which they know what players would likely want to do and providing them means for them to do that, thus making the experience interactive. The lack of interactivity led to Gone Home to be called \"walking simulators\" at its release, though since then, the industry has come to accept \"walking simulators\" to describe similarly contemplative narrative games with little direct interactivity, like The Stanley Parable, Firewatch, and What Remains of Edith Finch. Gone Home's approach to exploratory storytelling was a point of influence for parts of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Prey. Polygon named Gone Home among most important game of the 2010s for how it shifted games to focus on exploration and narrative over purely active gameplay.Due to both the atypical nature of Gone Home and its narrative centered around LGBT issues, it became a central point of discussion at the onset of the Gamergate controversy in August 2014. A portion of video game players, some who supported the Gamergate movement, criticized games like Gone Home and Depression Quest for lacking the qualities of normal video games while earning praise from the gaming press, as well as including topics like LGBT issues. Critics countered that these elements are part of considering video games as an art form, demonstrating how the medium is changing.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_101", "question": "Who was the composer of I Bet?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_6453", "text": "\"I Bet\" is a slow-tempo, somber, R&B ballad. Comprising snapping snares and canned synths, it is accompanied by throwback 1990s-style R&B production, and includes the use of string and keyboard instrumentation, and a steady beat. A quiet, contemplative and deeply personal record, \"I Bet\" moves away from the sound of Ciara's later discography and recalls some of her earlier work, namely \"And I\" (2005), and \"Promise\" (2006). Samuels' piano-laden, acoustic-driven, sparse production allowed Ciara to solicit a venting, passionate vocal in the song. The track features prominent background ad-libs by its co-writer, Theron Thomas, which were noted to share similarities with the works of Future. The vocal range displayed by Ciara on \"I Bet\" spans two octaves, from the low note of (Eb3) up to the belted note of (Eb5).\nThe lyrical content in \"I Bet\" are based on subjects of betrayal, trust issues and infidelity in a romantic relationship. They are aimed at an ex-lover who took Ciara for granted, and see her relive a relationship gone awry. \"I Bet\" also details a story about life in the public eye. Described as a realest, scathing breakup song, its content feature the singer making a stand to tell-off an ex-lover for not appreciating her. \"I Bet\" goes through the motions of feeling bitter, by acting as a callout of her former love interest's new girlfriend, manifested in the line, \"Is that your bitch over there givin' me the ugly stare / The one with the silicone ass and the Brazilian hair\". Despite her ex-lover's wrongdoings, Ciara admits she still loves him, namely in the lyric, \"I'm singing this song 'cause I love you\u2026 Right now it's killing me 'cause now I have to find someone else when all I wanted was you\". The track's hook serves as a revelation that the singer's former lover will want her back, manifested in the lines, \"I bet you start loving me / As soon as I start loving someone else / Somebody better than you / I bet you start needing me / As soon as you see me with someone else / Somebody other than you\". Later in the song, it is revealed that in the situation, Ciara is not as boastful as the chorus would suggest; and tells a story of the pain of finding a new lover when her future was planned with her former one.\nRegarding the subject of the track's lyrics, a number of journalists opined that they were based on Future, and in part insulted him as a diss track. Some critics noted that \"I Bet\" was the first time the Ciara weighed in on her break-up with Future, and wrote that the track \"bit back at Future\" and was essentially Ciara's take on their split. Referring to \"I Bet\" and Future's \"Just like Bruddas\", Stereogum's Tim Breihan observed: \"Future and Ciara were the two halves of one of rap and R&B's greatest power couples. But now, their ugly public breakup has reached the point where they're both writing songs about it\". Rap-Up mentioned, \"a hurt CiCi sings about a lover who did her wrong, much like her ex-fianc\u00e9 Future\". The lyrics in \"I Bet\" were described by radio station WKYS as telling a very clear story of Ciara's feelings towards Future. While Larry Fitzmaurice of The Fader noted that the track's cutting lyrics also depicted that there was no love lost between Ciara and Future, and opined that the lines\u2014\"I mean, I would stay if you could tell the truth / But you can't / No matter how much time I ask\"\u2014served as a \"seriously withering burn\" in the former couple's relationship. Other critics opined that \"I Bet\" showcased Ciara as self-assured and working through her past relationship.

He composed his first soundtracks for the film Inaye Thedi, debut film of director turned still photographer Antony Eastman and actress Silk Smitha. It was Devarajan himself, who suggested Johnson to the director. Then came Bharathan's Parvathi and Balachandra Menon's Premageethangal. Premageethangal was a notable success with four of its songs \u2013 \"Swapnam Verumoru Swapnam\", \"Nee Nirayoo Jeevanil\", \"Muthum Mudipponnum\" and  \"Kalakalamozhi\" attaining cult status.\nHe came to prominence through his collaboration with Malayalam author and director Padmarajan. Koodevide was their first venture, which had one of the most famous songs of Johnson \"Aadivaa Kaatte\", a pathbreaking song in Malayalam music history. It was one of the first songs in Malayalam to so many western classical elements. The song was born out of Padmarajan's need for a western song for his innovative film. Song composition took place in Woodland's Hotel, Chennai. Another notable feature of this song was the lyrics by O. N. V. Kurup, who for the first time wrote lyrics for a pre-composed song. Johnson worked for 11 films with Padmarajan, including his last film Njan Gandharvan. This productive collaboration saw the detailed screenplay and cinematography of Padmarajan become a fertile ground for expressive musical narration and thematic scores for Johnson. This is seen in some of the greatest motion pictures of Malayalam cinema, like Nombarathipoovu (1987). Another notable collaboration of Johnson was with director Sathyan Anthikkad, with whom he associated in almost 25 films. He was able to provide some of his most popular songs with Anthikkad and this combo is widely accepted to be one of the greatest director-composer collaborations in Malayalam cinema. Acclaimed Malayalam director Bharathan also collaborated with him in multiple films including Parvathy, Palangal, Ormakkayi, Kattathe Kilikkoodu, Ente Upasana, Oru Minnaminunginte Nurunguvettam, Ozhivukalam, Malootty, Chamayam and Churam. His major other collaborations with directors include Mohan (Oru Katha Oru Nunakkatha, Sakshyam, Pakshe and Angane Oru Avadhikkalathu), Sibi Malayil (Kireedam, Chenkol, Dasaratham and Nee Varuvolam), Sreenivasan (Vadakkunokkiyantram and Chinthavishtayaya Shyamala), Lohithadas (Bhoothakkannadi, Kamal (Peruvannapurathe Visheshangal, Shubhayathra, Ee Puzhayum Kadannu and Paavam Paavam Rajakumaran), and Balachandra Menon (Shesham Kazhchayil, Premageethangal, Kilukilukkam, Kelkatha Shabdam and Nayam Vyakthamakkunnu).\nHe is also noted for his collaboration with the Malayalam lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri. Their association began in 1989 with Sathyan Anthikkad's social satire Varavelpu. Most of Johnson's notable works were in the late eighties and early nineties. In 1991, he scored a record number of 31 films, including 29 with Kaithapram. Johnson won National awards for two consecutive years. He won his first National Award for best music direction for the motion picture Ponthan Mada (1993). The next year he got his second National award for Sukrutham for the background score.\nAfter an extremely successful career of more than a decade, Johnson took a sabbatical from film scoring by the end of the nineties. The quantity of his works began perishing during this time. By the beginning of the 2000s, he didn't sign any new projects that even his most noted collaborator Sathyan Anthikkad had to find a new composer. In 2003 he did the background score for the NFDC movie Parinamam (The Change) directed by P. Venu.In 2004, he sang the song \"Theekuruvi\" from Kangalal Kaidhu Sei, which was composed by A. R.

Larson suggested setting the play \"amid poverty, homelessness, spunky gay life, drag queens and punk\" in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, which happened to be down the street from his Greenwich Village apartment. He also came up with the show's ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that \"rent\" also means torn apart). In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make Rent his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for Rent; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera \"to bring musical theater to the MTV generation\". Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds and be given credit for \"original concept & additional lyrics\".Jonathan Larson focused on composing Rent in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the Moondance Diner to support himself. Over the course of years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained 42 songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of Rent's script. When Rent had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed, including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.As of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of Rent featured songs that never made it into the final version, such as:\n\n\"You're a Fool\"\n\"Do a Little Business\", the predecessor of \"You'll See\", featuring Benny, Mark, Roger, Collins and Angel\n\"Female to Female A & B\", featuring Maureen and Joanne\n\"He's a Fool\"\n\"He Says\"\n\"Right Brain, Left Brain\", later rewritten as \"One Song Glory\", featuring Roger\n\"You'll Get Over It\", the predecessor of \"Tango: Maureen\", featuring Mark and Maureen\n\"Real Estate\", a number wherein Benny tries to convince Mark to become a real estate agent and drop his filmmaking\n\"Open Road\", the predecessor of \"What You Own\", with a backing track similar to this in \"Your Eyes\"This workshop version of Rent starred Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi. Larson continued to work on Rent, gradually reworking its flaws and staging more workshop productions.On January 24, 1996, after the musical's final dress rehearsal before its off-Broadway opening, Larson had his first (and only) newspaper interview; music critic Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times \u2013 been attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini's opera \u2013 requested the interview. Larson would not live to see Rent's success; he died from an undiagnosed aortic dissection (believed to have resulted from Marfan syndrome) early the next morning, January 25, 1996. Friends and family gathered at the New York Theatre Workshop, and the first preview of Rent became a sing-through of the musical in Larson's memory.The show premiered as planned and quickly gained popularity fueled by enthusiastic reviews and the recent death of its composer. It proved extremely successful during its off-Broadway run, selling out all its shows at the 150-seat New York Theatre Workshop.

Its entry in Guinness World Records states that, by January 1986, 1,600 cover versions had been made. After Muzak switched in the 1990s to programs based on commercial recordings, its inventory grew to include about 500 \"Yesterday\" covers. In his 1972 article on the development of rock music, Joel Vance of Stereo Review magazine credited the song with originating the vogue for classical and baroque rock, anticipating the Rolling Stones' recording of \"As Tears Go By\" and works by artists such as the Moody Blues and the Classics IV.\"Yesterday\" won the Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Song of 1965\", and came second in the \"Most Performed Work of the Year\" category, behind the Lennon\u2013McCartney composition \"Michelle\". More recently, Rolling Stone ranked \"Yesterday\" at number 13 on its 2004 list \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" and fourth on its 2010 list of \"The Beatles' 100 Greatest Songs\". In 1999, Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) placed \"Yesterday\" third on its list of songs of the 20th century most performed on American radio and television, with approximately seven million performances. \"Yesterday\" was surpassed only by the Association's \"Never My Love\" and the Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\". \"Yesterday\" was voted Best Song of the 20th century in a 1999 BBC Radio 2 poll.The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1997. Although it was nominated for Song of the Year at the 1966 Grammy Awards, it lost out to Tony Bennett's \"The Shadow of Your Smile\". \"Yesterday\" was nominated for six Grammys in total that year, and \"Help!\" was also nominated in four categories. After the band had failed to win any of the ten awards, Alan Livingston, the head of Capitol Records, officially protested about the results, saying that \"Yesterday\" being passed over for the Song of the Year \"makes a mockery of the whole event\".\nChuck Berry said that \"Yesterday\" was the song that he wished that he had written. \"Yesterday\" has also been criticised for being mundane and mawkish. Bob Dylan had a marked dislike for the song, stating that \"If you go into the Library of Congress, you can find a lot better than that. There are millions of songs like 'Michelle' and 'Yesterday' written in Tin Pan Alley.\" Accompanied by Harrison, Dylan recorded his own version of \"Yesterday\" four years later,, but it was never released.Shortly before he died in 1980, Lennon commented, \"Although the lyrics don't resolve into any sense, they're good lines. They certainly work ... but if you read the whole song, it doesn't say anything\" and added the song was \"beautiful \u2013 and I never wished I'd written it\". Lennon made reference to \"Yesterday\" in his song \"How Do You Sleep?\" on his 1971 album Imagine. The song appears to attack McCartney with the line \"The only thing you done was yesterday, but since you've gone you're just another day\", a reference to McCartney's recent hit \"Another Day\".\nIn 2001, McCartney said that he had asked Yoko Ono to agree to change the writing credit for \"Yesterday\" from \"Lennon/McCartney\" to \"McCartney/Lennon\". He said that Ono refused, which was one of the reasons for their poor relationship at the time.At the 2006 Grammy Awards, McCartney performed \"Yesterday\" live as a mash-up with Linkin Park and Jay Z's \"Numb/Encore\".\nIn 2012, the BBC reported that \"Yesterday\" remained the fourth-most-successful song of all time in terms of royalties paid, having amassed a total of \u00a319.5 million in payments.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As a thanks, the cats give Haru gifts of catnip and mice, and she is offered the Prince's hand in marriage. Her mixed reply is taken as a yes.\nWanting none of this, Haru hears a kind female voice which tells her to seek out Muta, a large white cat, and to get directions to the Cat Bureau from him. Muta leads her there to meet Baron Humbert von Gikkingen (the same Baron from Whisper of the Heart), who is a cat figurine given life by the work of his artist, and Toto, a stone raven who comes to life much like the Baron. Soon after meeting them, Haru and Muta are forcefully taken to the Cat Kingdom, leaving Toto and the Baron in the human world to follow the group from the air; they find the entrance to the Cat Kingdom on Earth: five lakes forming a cat's paw.\nHaru is treated to a feast at the castle of the Cat King. She begins to slowly turn into a cat with tan paws, ears, nose, tail and whiskers (for a second, she also gets fangs), though she still remains mostly human. The King hopes that she will make a suitable bride for the Prince. At the feast, the Baron (in disguise) dances with Haru as part of the entertainment. He reveals to her that the more she loses herself in the kingdom, the more cat-like she will become, and that she has to rediscover her true self. When the Baron is discovered and is forced to fight the guards, he and Haru are helped by Yuki, a white cat maiden in the palace who had previously tried to warn Haru to leave the Cat Kingdom. After Yuki shows them an escape tunnel, Haru, the Baron and Muta move through a maze to a tower, which contains a portal to Haru's world. The King goes through a series of efforts to keep them in the kingdom long enough for Haru to remain trapped in her cat form; his ultimate plan is still to force her to become his daughter-in-law.\nPrince Lune and his guards return to the Cat Kingdom, revealing the King was not acting on his behalf and that he planned on proposing to Yuki. Muta is revealed to be Renaldo Moon, a notorious criminal in the Kingdom (having devoured a whole lake of fish in one session). Haru learns that the strange voice who had advised her to go to the Cat Bureau was Yuki's. In her childhood, Haru had saved Yuki from starvation by giving her the fish crackers she was eating, and thus, Yuki has now repaid her kindness. After she rejects the King's marriage proposal outright, Muta tells Haru, \"I respect a woman who stands up for herself\" and proceeds to help her escape from the King's soldiers.\nEventually, the Baron, Haru and Muta escape the cats' realm, with the aid of Prince Lune and Toto, and Haru discovers her true self, telling the Baron how much she has come to like him. He tells her the doors of the Cat Bureau will be open for her again if the need ever arises.

The text was compiled from the King James Bible and the Coverdale Psalter by Charles Jennens. It was first performed in Dublin on 13 April 1742 and received its London premiere a year later. After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music.\nHandel's reputation in England, where he had lived since 1712, had been established through his compositions of Italian opera. He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste; Messiah was his sixth work in this genre. Although its structure resembles that of opera, it is not in dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. Instead, Jennens's text is an extended reflection on Jesus as the Messiah called Christ. The text begins in Part I with prophecies by Isaiah and others, and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds, the only \"scene\" taken from the Gospels. In Part II, Handel concentrates on the Passion of Jesus and ends with the Hallelujah chorus. In Part III he covers Paul's teachings on the resurrection of the dead and Christ's glorification in heaven.\nHandel wrote Messiah for modest vocal and instrumental forces, with optional alternate settings for many of the individual numbers. In the years after his death, the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale, with giant orchestras and choirs. In other efforts to update it, its orchestration was revised and amplified, such as Mozart's Der Messias. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the trend has been towards reproducing a greater fidelity to Handel's original intentions, although \"big Messiah\" productions continue to be mounted. A near-complete version was issued on 78 rpm discs in 1928; since then the work has been recorded many times.\nThe autograph manuscript of the oratorio is preserved in the British Library.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Musically, the song contains an array of instrumentation and is driven by a brass and flute motif. Saxophonist Donny McCaslin provided the solos. Inspired by the writings of poet Robert Browning, the lyrics of \"Sue\" are open-ended, depicting the fall of a marriage.

The song has been compared to her previous hip hop-flavored dance songs, \"Goodies\", and \"Work\", and has also been compared to Missy Elliott's \"Work It\". \"Gimmie Dat\" was released as the third single from Basic Instinct on October 15, 2010. In some countries, the song was released alongside \"Speechless\", as a dual single.\n\"Gimmie Dat\" was well received by music critics, who compliment its uptempo beat. Although the song was well received by critics, it only managed to peak at the lower half of US and UK charts. An official remix of the song, dubbed the \"Slow Bass Remix\" was released in the United States on December 21, 2010. It was later confirmed that Ciara had paid for the music video, radio play and promotion of the single herself because the label refused to do so. According to Ciara, her record label even told radio stations to stop playing the song. \"Gimmie Dat\" was Ciara's final single released under LaFace Records, which she had her contract released from due to Basic Instinct's underperforming sales.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "639_173", "question": "Who was the composer of Time?", "ctxs": [{"id": "22_28833", "text": "Johnson began his independent career by composing the film scores of Bharathan's Aaravam (1978), Thakara (1980) and Chamaram (1980). He composed his first soundtracks for the film Inaye Thedi, debut film of director turned still photographer Antony Eastman and actress Silk Smitha. It was Devarajan himself, who suggested Johnson to the director. Then came Bharathan's Parvathi and Balachandra Menon's Premageethangal. Premageethangal was a notable success with four of its songs \u2013 \"Swapnam Verumoru Swapnam\", \"Nee Nirayoo Jeevanil\", \"Muthum Mudipponnum\" and  \"Kalakalamozhi\" attaining cult status.\nHe came to prominence through his collaboration with Malayalam author and director Padmarajan. Koodevide was their first venture, which had one of the most famous songs of Johnson \"Aadivaa Kaatte\", a pathbreaking song in Malayalam music history. It was one of the first songs in Malayalam to so many western classical elements. The song was born out of Padmarajan's need for a western song for his innovative film. Song composition took place in Woodland's Hotel, Chennai. Another notable feature of this song was the lyrics by O. N. V. Kurup, who for the first time wrote lyrics for a pre-composed song. Johnson worked for 11 films with Padmarajan, including his last film Njan Gandharvan. This productive collaboration saw the detailed screenplay and cinematography of Padmarajan become a fertile ground for expressive musical narration and thematic scores for Johnson. This is seen in some of the greatest motion pictures of Malayalam cinema, like Nombarathipoovu (1987). Another notable collaboration of Johnson was with director Sathyan Anthikkad, with whom he associated in almost 25 films. He was able to provide some of his most popular songs with Anthikkad and this combo is widely accepted to be one of the greatest director-composer collaborations in Malayalam cinema. Acclaimed Malayalam director Bharathan also collaborated with him in multiple films including Parvathy, Palangal, Ormakkayi, Kattathe Kilikkoodu, Ente Upasana, Oru Minnaminunginte Nurunguvettam, Ozhivukalam, Malootty, Chamayam and Churam. His major other collaborations with directors include Mohan (Oru Katha Oru Nunakkatha, Sakshyam, Pakshe and Angane Oru Avadhikkalathu), Sibi Malayil (Kireedam, Chenkol, Dasaratham and Nee Varuvolam), Sreenivasan (Vadakkunokkiyantram and Chinthavishtayaya Shyamala), Lohithadas (Bhoothakkannadi, Kamal (Peruvannapurathe Visheshangal, Shubhayathra, Ee Puzhayum Kadannu and Paavam Paavam Rajakumaran), and Balachandra Menon (Shesham Kazhchayil, Premageethangal, Kilukilukkam, Kelkatha Shabdam and Nayam Vyakthamakkunnu).\nHe is also noted for his collaboration with the Malayalam lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri. Their association began in 1989 with Sathyan Anthikkad's social satire Varavelpu. Most of Johnson's notable works were in the late eighties and early nineties. In 1991, he scored a record number of 31 films, including 29 with Kaithapram. Johnson won National awards for two consecutive years. He won his first National Award for best music direction for the motion picture Ponthan Mada (1993). The next year he got his second National award for Sukrutham for the background score.\nAfter an extremely successful career of more than a decade, Johnson took a sabbatical from film scoring by the end of the nineties. The quantity of his works began perishing during this time. By the beginning of the 2000s, he didn't sign any new projects that even his most noted collaborator Sathyan Anthikkad had to find a new composer. In 2003 he did the background score for the NFDC movie Parinamam (The Change) directed by P. Venu.In 2004, he sang the song \"Theekuruvi\" from Kangalal Kaidhu Sei, which was composed by A. R. Rahman. Perhaps it is the only song recorded by him for any composer other than himself.

SFX called it a \"brave episode to air so early, but it works\", praising the way the alien concepts were reminiscent to the classic series. However, the reviewer wrote that \"the full drama of the event is never quite captured\" and \"the murder plot...never quite takes flight, but it provides the framework for some brilliant scenes\". In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described \"The End of the World\" as \"sheer, unadulterated fun\", particularly praising the emotional connection that was built between the Doctor and Rose. Burk felt that there could have been more of a build-up to the Cassandra revelation, but commented that \"a lot of the success of the story\" was due to her. Burk's co-author Robert Smith added that the episode allowed Eccleston to shine by offering the Doctor a wide range of emotions. Despite their positive reviews, Burk and Smith noted that the switch at the end of the hallway with giant fans was \"contrived\" and \"silly\". In 2013, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times felt that the episode had everything to be expected from Davies' Doctor Who: boldness, camp, and emotional and character drama. The A.V.

Canadian rock band Rush's drummer Neil Peart credited the adventurous and innovative style of Michael Giles as an influence on his own approach to percussion.King Crimson's influence extends to many bands from diverse genres, especially of the 1990s and 2000s. Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana, had stated that the album Red had a major influence on the sound of their final studio album In Utero. Tool are known to be heavily influenced by King Crimson, with vocalist Maynard James Keenan joking on a tour with them: \"Now you know who we ripped off. Just don't tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson.\" Modern progressive, experimental, psychedelic and indie rock bands have cited them as an influence as well, including the Mars Volta, Primus, Mystery Jets, Fanfarlo, Phish, and Anekdoten, who first practiced together playing King Crimson songs. Steven Wilson, the leader of Porcupine Tree, was responsible for remixing King Crimson's back catalogue in surround sound and said that the process had an enormous influence on his solo albums, and his band was influenced by King Crimson. In November 2012 the Flaming Lips in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs released a track-by-track reinterpretation of In the Court of the Crimson King entitled Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn.

The seminal hardcore punk group Black Flag acknowledge Wetton-era King Crimson as an influence on their experimental period in the mid-1980s.

Bad Religion cites the lyrics of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" on their single \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\" and the name of their record label, Epitaph (founded by their guitarist Brett Gurewitz), comes from the song of the same name on Crimson's debut album. Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid considered Robert Fripp as one of his guitar influences.King Crimson have frequently been cited as pioneers of progressive metal and as an influence on bands of this genre, including Opeth, Mastodon, Between the Buried and Me, Leprous, Haken, the Ocean, Caligula's Horse, Last Chance to Reason, and Indukti.

He copied a number of melodies he had selected from an early 19th century American collection of British folk songs, and began to make notes on the film's scenario. Emerging from this was background music for a hunting scene in the film, which incorporated a sketch the composer had labeled \"Song for Bessie.\" After Bernard Herrmann replaced him in Jane Eyre, Stravinsky recycled this music into what eventually became the \"Eclogue\" to the Ode. While visiting New York City in April of that year, Serge Koussevitzky presented the composer with a commission for a new orchestral work in memory of his wife, Natalia. Stravinsky's fee would be paid by the conductor's newly established Koussevitzky Foundation. The score was completed in July 1943.Stravinsky sent the finished Ode to Koussevitzky on July 9. He described the music's first part as \"a praise to the departed,\" and its central section as a \"concert champ\u00eatre, t[hat] i[s], music at the heart of nature, the principle which [your wife] defended with such passion and which you realized so brilliantly in Tanglewood.\" Of the closing \"Epitaph\" the composer said that it was a \"headstone inscription ... which will conclude my song in memory of the departed.\" Koussevitzky replied on July 21 that he was \"deeply touched and grateful\" for the music.Two weeks before the score's debut, Stravinsky assured Koussevitzky that the score and parts he had sent for the Ode were \"carefully corrected\" by him. Nevertheless, a number of errors committed by the music copyists and the composer himself had escaped his notice. The resulting \"mild cacophony\" heard in the closing moments of its world premiere on October 8, his wife Vera noted, left Stravinsky feeling \"sad because [it] was badly played.\" Although he apologized profusely to Koussevitzky in private for his \"ridiculous inattentiveness\" in proofreading the Ode, Stravinsky never publicly acknowledged any culpability in the botched premiere.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Newman and Chaplin had a falling out near the end of the Modern Times soundtrack recording sessions, leading to Newman's angry departure.\nThe romance theme was later given lyrics, and became the pop standard \"Smile\", first recorded by Nat King Cole. A cover of this song by Jimmy Durante was also used in the trailer for the 2019 film Joker, in which the lead character also watches scenes from a showing of Modern Times after sneaking into a movie theatre.\nModern Times was the first film where Chaplin's voice is heard as he performs L\u00e9o Daniderff's comical song \"Je cherche apr\u00e8s Titine\". Chaplin's version is also known as \"The Nonsense Song\", as his character sings it in gibberish. The lyrics are nonsensical but appear to contain words from French and Italian; the use of deliberately half-intelligible wording for comic effect points the way towards Adenoid Hynkel's speeches in The Great Dictator.\nAccording to film composer David Raksin, Chaplin wrote the music as a young man wanting to make a name for himself. He would sit, often in the washroom, humming tunes and telling Raksin to \"take this down\". Raksin's job was to turn the humming into a score and create timings and synchronization that fit the situations. Chaplin was a violinist and had some musical knowledge, but he was not an orchestrator and was unfamiliar with synchronization. Along with Edward B. Powell, Raksin did receive screen credit for the music arrangements. Raksin later created scores for films including Laura and The Day After.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The text has no recitatives alternating with arias, but instead three biblical quotations, opening with verses from Psalm 126, then a verse from the Book of Jeremiah about God's greatness, and finally the angels' song from the Nativity according to the Gospel of Luke.

He derived the first chorus, in the style of a French overture, from the overture to his fourth Orchestral Suite, embedding vocal parts in its fast middle section. The song of the angels is based on the Christmas interpolation Virga Jesse Floruit of his Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a.

The French libretto is adapted (with very few changes) from the symbolist play of the same name by Maurice Maeterlinck, itself loosely based on the French literary tale La Barbe bleue by Charles Perrault.\nDukas had been impressed by Maeterlinck's play when it was first published in 1899. Maeterlinck had initially reserved the rights to use Ariane as a libretto for Edvard Grieg. When Grieg abandoned his plans to compose the opera, Maeterlinck offered it to Dukas instead. Dukas worked on the score between 1899 and 1906.The work has often been compared to Debussy's opera Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (1902), also based on a Maeterlinck play; Debussy had virtually finished his score by the time Dukas began work on his. The names of Barbe-bleue's five former wives are taken from previous plays by Maeterlinck: S\u00e9lysette from Aglavaine et S\u00e9lysette (1896), Alladine from Alladine et Palomides (1894), Ygraine and Bellang\u00e8re from La mort de Tintagiles (1894), and M\u00e9lisande from Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande. Dukas, who knew Debussy well, actually borrowed three bars from Debussy's opera to accompany the first mention of M\u00e9lisande, although the character is minor in Dukas' opera. Ariane takes her name from the legend of Ariadne and the Cretan labyrinth, although she combines the roles of both Ariadne and Theseus, who freed the captive Athenian virgins from the Minotaur just as Ariane liberates\u2014or tries to liberate\u2014the wives from Bluebeard.It received its first performance at the Op\u00e9ra Comique in Paris on 10 May 1907.

In May, during the Montreal portion of the bed-in, counterculture figures from across North America visited Lennon, including American psychologist Timothy Leary, an early advocate of LSD, whom Lennon admired. Leary intended to run for Governor of California in the following year's election and asked Lennon to write him a campaign song based on the campaign's slogan, \"Come Together \u2013 Join the Party!\" The resulting chant was only a line long: \"Come together and join the party\". Lennon promised to finish and record the song, and Leary later recalled Lennon giving him a tape of the piece, but the two did not interact again.In July 1969, during sessions for the Beatles' album Abbey Road, Lennon used the phrase \"come together\" from the Leary campaign song to compose a new song for the album. Based on the 1956 single \"You Can't Catch Me\" by American guitarist Chuck Berry, the composition began as an up-tempo blues number, only slightly altering Berry's original lyric of \"Here come a flattop / He was movin' up with me\" to \"Here come ol' flattop / He come groovin' up slowly\". Lennon further incorporated the phrase \"shoot me\" from his unfinished and unreleased January 1969 song, \"Watching Rainbows\". The lyrics were inspired by his relationship with Ono, and were delivered quickly, as in the Berry song. Author Peter Doggett wrote that \"each phrase [passes] too quickly to be understood at first hearing, the sound as important as the meaning\".When Lennon presented the composition to his bandmates, his songwriting partner Paul McCartney noticed its similarity to \"You Can't Catch Me\" and recommended they slow it in tempo to reduce the resemblance. Beatles historian Jonathan Gould has suggested that the song has only a single \"pariah-like protagonist\" and Lennon was \"painting another sardonic self-portrait\".

All right, go ahead and shoot!\" Dance Magazine gave Linn plaudits for her role as Louise, stating, \"Bambi doesn't come on until twenty minutes before eleven, and for the next forty minutes, she practically holds the audience in her hand\".  Howard Barnes in the New York Herald Tribune also applauded the dancing: \"It has waited for Miss de Mille to come through with peculiarly American dance patterns for a musical show to become as much a dance as a song show.\"When the musical returned to New York in 1949, The New York Times reviewer Brooks Atkinson described Carousel as \"a conspicuously superior musical play ... Carousel, which was warmly appreciated when it opened, seems like nothing less than a masterpiece now.\"  In 1954, when Carousel was revived at City Center, Atkinson discussed the musical in his review:\n\nCarousel has no comment to make on anything of topical importance.  The theme is timeless and universal:  the devotion of two people who love each other through thick and thin, complicated in this case by the wayward personality of the man, who cannot fulfill the responsibilities he has assumed.  ... Billy is a bum, but Carousel recognizes the decency of his motives and admires his independence.  There are no slick solutions in Carousel.\nStephen Sondheim noted the duo's ability to take the innovations of Oklahoma! and apply them to a serious setting: \"Oklahoma! is about a picnic, Carousel is about life and death.\"  Critic Eric Bentley, on the other hand, wrote that \"the last scene of Carousel is an impertinence:  I refuse to be lectured to by a musical comedy scriptwriter on the education of children, the nature of the good life, and the contribution of the American small town to the salvation of souls.\"New York Times critic Frank Rich said of the 1992 London production: \"What is remarkable about Mr. Hytner's direction, aside from its unorthodox faith in the virtues of simplicity and stillness, is its ability to make a 1992 audience believe in Hammerstein's vision of redemption, which has it that a dead sinner can return to Earth to do godly good.\"  The Hytner production in New York was hailed by many critics as a grittier Carousel, which they deemed more appropriate for the 1990s.Clive Barnes of the New York Post called it a \"defining Carousel\u2014hard-nosed, imaginative, and exciting.\"Critic Michael Billington has commented that \"lyrically [Carousel] comes perilously close to acceptance of the inevitability of domestic violence.\" BroadwayWorld.com stated in 2013 that Carousel is now \"considered somewhat controversial in terms of its attitudes on domestic violence\" because Julie chooses to stay with Billy despite the abuse; actress Kelli O'Hara noted that the domestic violence that Julie \"chooses to deal with \u2013 is a real, existing and very complicated thing. And exploring it is an important part of healing it.\"Rodgers considered Carousel his favorite of all his musicals and wrote, \"it affects me deeply every time I see it performed\".  In 1999, Time magazine, in its \"Best of the Century\" list, named Carousel the Best Musical of the 20th century, writing that Rodgers and Hammerstein \"set the standards for the 20th century musical, and this show features their most beautiful score and the most skillful and affecting example of their musical storytelling\".  Hammerstein's grandson, Oscar Andrew Hammerstein, in his book about his family, suggested that the wartime situation made Carousel's ending especially poignant to its original viewers, \"Every American grieved the loss of a brother, son, father, or friend ... the audience empathized with [Billy's] all-too-human efforts to offer advice, to seek forgiveness, to complete an unfinished life, and to bid a proper good-bye from beyond the grave.\"  Author and composer Ethan Mordden agreed with that perspective:\n\nIf Oklahoma! developed the moral argument for sending American boys overseas, Carousel offered consolation to those wives and mothers whose boys would only return in spirit.

Both projects were to be produced for the ABC network. The television film was to introduce several students applying for positions at the New York City of Performing Arts, while the spin-off series would focus on their lives during their four years of attending the school. The series would feature new cast members as the young students, as well as those from the 1980 film, as well as updated versions of the songs \"Fame\" and \"Out Here on My Own\". Michael Gore was to act as an executive producer for both projects with his producing partner Lawrence Cohen, through their production label White Cap Productions. However, both television projects were never produced.In 2003, MGM Television produced a reality television series titled Fame, in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the largely popular American Idol. The concept of the series involves discovering a \"triple threat\"\u2014a person who can sing, act and dance and has a \"bigger-than-life\" personality. The show, co-hosted by Debbie Allen, and Joey Fatone, featured Carnie Wilson, Johnny Wright and JoJo Wright as the panel of judges. The series premiered on NBC on May 28, 2003, and a total of ten episode were produced. The two competing finalists of the series were Shannon Bex and Harlemm Lee. Lee emerged as the winner of the competition, based on home-audience votes.In 2012, MGM Television announced it would produce a modern-day television series inspired by the film, with Nigel Lythgoe acting as an executive producer. The project resurfaced in June 2015, when The Hollywood Reporter announced that MGM Television would be co-producing the series with A&E Networks for Lifetime, with Josh Safran attached as the show's writer and executive producer.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was later ported to Windows in June 2019 and iOS in August 2019.\nIn Journey, the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names until after the game's credits. The only form of communication between the two is a musical chime, which transforms dull pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story.\nReviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger, calling it a moving and emotional experience, and have since listed it as one of the greatest video games of all time. Journey won several \"game of the year\" awards and received several other awards and nominations, including a Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media nomination for the 2013 Grammy Awards.

Co-produced by Bowie and longtime collaborator Tony Visconti, the song originated after the two saw bandleader and composer Maria Schneider perform with her orchestra in May 2014. They began collaborating on Bowie's first major project since The Next Day (2013). Following workshop sessions in mid-June, the track was recorded officially at Avatar Studios in New York on 24 July 2014, with contributions from Schneider's orchestra.\nAlthough he had experimented with jazz earlier in his career, \"Sue\" marked Bowie's first explorations into experimental jazz. Musically, the song contains an array of instrumentation and is driven by a brass and flute motif. Saxophonist Donny McCaslin provided the solos. Inspired by the writings of poet Robert Browning, the lyrics of \"Sue\" are open-ended, depicting the fall of a marriage. Premiered in October 2014, the song garnered positive reviews from music critics, but some felt its inclusion on a compilation album downplayed the track. A music video directed by Tom Hingston promoted it.\nBowie re-recorded both \"Sue\" and its B-side, \"'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore\" for his twenty-sixth and final studio album, Blackstar (2016).

David Hackl, who served as production designer for the two previous Saw films, was offered to direct the film, but the day he received the offer his wife was diagnosed with cancer. Producers offered him directorial duties for Saw V and Saw VI.As Whannell was uninterested in writing any more Saw films, Twisted Pictures sought new writers and ideas for the fourth Saw film, making it the first film to not be written by him. An executive discovered Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton and read their script The Midnight Man. The executive thought that the duo's script could serve as a prequel to the first film, detailing a traumatic event in Jigsaw/John's early life. However, producers Mark Burg and Oren Koules did not want to do a prequel and dropped the idea, but the script led Dunstan and Melton to be hired to write the next three Saw films.

The duo did not have any trouble in bringing Jigsaw back into the story despite his death in the last film, as the character had been dying since the original film, feeling that the film would not feel like a Saw entry without the character.

There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their mana\u2014energy for casting spells\u2014constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, Sacrifice offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.\nSacrifice was created by a small team of developers; most of the work was done by four key personnel. The graphic engine of the game uses tesselation: thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed, the number of polygons is reduced. By adjusting the required level of detail, Sacrifice can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics.

In 1950 he was invited by Rear-Admiral Charles Lambe to be a guest of the Royal Navy Home Fleet on its spring cruise through the waters where the Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson's final battle, had been fought. Berkeley was provided with two grand pianos in his cabin (enabling the composer and Lambe, who was an accomplished pianist, to play duets), and the fleet slowed down between Cape St. Vincent and Cape Trafalgar to enable the composer to drink in the scene of Nelson's final moments.The opera had a partial performance, to piano accompaniment, at the Wigmore Hall in London in 1953, when the part of Nelson was sung by Peter Pears. Critics received this well, but the reviews of the full version a year later, staged  at Sadler's Wells Theatre with the encouragement of Benjamin Britten, were mixed. This may have been because Britten's own The Turn of the Screw also premiered around the same time, inevitably invoking comparisons. It may also have affected critics that earlier in 1954, Berkeley's second, and very different, opera, the surrealistic comedy A Dinner Engagement, had been premiered; this successful one-act work remains the only one of Berkeley's operas to have held the stage.\nNelson had only nine performances in the 1954/5 season. In 1965 the composer wrote 'I should now want to rewrite so much of it if it were to be revived. I do think it has good things in it, but I'm not satisfied with it as a whole.'

{"id": "639_378", "question": "Who was the composer of Unbreakable?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_7700", "text": "Unbreakable is a 2000 American superhero thriller film written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, and starring Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright, Spencer Treat Clark, and Charlayne Woodard. It is the first installment in the Unbreakable film series. In Unbreakable, David Dunn (Willis) survives a train crash with no injuries, leading to the realization that he harbors superhuman abilities. As he begins to grapple with this discovery, he comes to the attention of disabled comic book store owner Elijah Price (Jackson), who manipulates David to understand him.\nShyamalan organized the narrative of Unbreakable to parallel a comic book's traditional three-part story structure. After settling on the origin story, Shyamalan wrote the screenplay as a speculative screenplay with Willis already set to star in the film and Jackson in mind to portray Elijah Price. Filming began in April 2000 and was completed in July.\nUnbreakable was released on November 22, 2000. It received generally positive reviews, with praise for Shyamalan's direction, screenplay, its aesthetics, the performances, the emotional weight of the story, cinematography, and the score by James Newton Howard. The film has subsequently gained a strong cult following. A realistic vision of the superhero genre, it is regarded by many as one of Shyamalan's best films and one of the best superhero films. In 2011, Time listed it as one of the top ten superhero films of all time, ranking it number four. Quentin Tarantino also included it on his list of the top 20 films released since 1992.After years of development on a follow-up film, a thematic sequel, Split, with Willis reprising his role as David Dunn in a cameo role, was released in January 2017. After the financial and critical success of Split, Shyamalan immediately began working on a third film, titled Glass, which was released January 18, 2019, thus making Unbreakable the first installment in the Unbreakable film series.", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "639_379", "question": "Who was the composer of Testimony?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_11102", "text": "Each side of the debate has amassed statements opposing or supporting the book's authenticity. In 1979, a letter condemning the book was signed by six of the composer's acquaintances: Veniamin Basner, Kara Karayev, Yury Levitin, Karen Khachaturian, Boris Tishchenko and Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg. Initially, the book was also criticised by the composer's son, Maxim, but later he and his sister Galina have become supporters of Volkov. Shostakovich's widow, Irina, continues to reject the book.Supporters of the book discount the statements of those who were still in the Soviet Union as extorted or fabricated. They point to endorsements of the book by emigres and after the fall of the Soviet Union, including Maxim and Galina Shostakovich.However, endorsing the factuality of the book does not necessarily mean endorsing it as what it claims to be, i.e., the authenticated memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich. For instance, Maxim Shostakovich has said that the book gives a true picture of the Soviet political situation and correctly represents his father's political views, but continues to speak of the book as being \"about my father, not by him\". In 1980, after he had defected from the Soviet Union, he denied the book was his father's memoirs.Others who endorse the book are not necessarily even aware of the questions about Shostakovich's signatures raised by Laurel Fay (see above, Recycled material) and therefore their competence in judging the book's authenticity as Shostakovich's memoirs (as opposed to its factual authenticity) is in question. Also, they include musicians whose personal acquaintance with Shostakovich was extremely limited (e.g., Vladimir Ashkenazy).\nThe claim that the condemnation of the book by the six Soviet composers was extorted or fabricated is also questionable. None of the five composers who were still living in the 1990s has disassociated himself from the condemnation after the fall of the Soviet Union. Kara Karayev died in 1982, but his son Faradzh Karayev has testified in 1999 that his father had read the German translation of Testimony and told his family, \"Mitya [Dmitri Shostakovich] couldn't have written this, let alone allowed its publication. It is clearly a fabrication\". (This claim is also supported by Kara Karayev's diary entries from the same period.) In an article written in the same year, \"The Regime and Vulgarity\", Elena Basner has told that her father Veniamin Basner, Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg (both of whom died in 1996), and Boris Tishchenko were also acquainted with (and indignant about) the book before signing the condemnation.As a translator of Testimony, the Finnish musicologist Seppo Heikinheimo (1938\u20131997) had a copy of the Russian-language manuscript of Testimony in his possession and claims that he showed the text to dozens of Russian musicians, many of whom knew Shostakovich. According to Heikinheimo, Mstislav Rostropovich (in 1979) considered that Testimony is authentic, as did Rudolf Barshai, Kirill Kondrashin, Yuri Lyubimov, Gidon Kremer, Emil Gilels, and Sviatoslav Richter.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In addition, several incidents, of which the Forest of Fontainebleau scene and auto-da-f\u00e9 were the most substantial, were borrowed from Eug\u00e8ne Cormon's 1846 play Philippe II, Roi d'Espagne. The opera is most often performed in Italian translation, usually under the title Don Carlo.\nThe opera's story is based on conflicts in the life of Carlos, Prince of Asturias (1545\u20131568). Though he was betrothed to Elisabeth of Valois, part of the peace treaty ending the Italian War of 1551\u201359 between the Houses of Habsburg and Valois demanded that she be married instead to his father Philip II of Spain.

The first performance in Italy was in Bologna in October 1867, also in Italian translation. After some revisions by Verdi, it was performed in Italian in Naples in November/December 1872. Verdi was also responsible for a short four-act \"Milan version\" in which the first act was removed and the ballet omitted (performed in Milan in January 1884 in Italian translation) but also apparently approved a five-act \"Modena version\" in which the first act was restored but the ballet still omitted (performed in Modena in December 1886, also in Italian translation). Around 1970, substantial passages of music cut before the premiere were discovered in Paris archives, giving rise to at least one additional version that can be ascribed to Verdi: the version he prepared for the Paris Opera in 1866, before any cuts were made.

A short time later, in 1840, the town was renamed Madison in honor of President James Madison.\nTo resolve the frequent post-office confusion with another Texas community called Madisonville, the town was renamed \"Orange\" in 1858. The area experienced rapid growth in the late 19th century due to 17 sawmills within the city limits, making Orange the center of the Texas lumber industry. Orange's growth led to the arrival of many immigrants in the late 19th century, including a moderately sized Jewish population by 1896.  In 1898, the county built a courthouse in the city, which later burned down and was replaced by the Orange County Courthouse.\nThe harbor leading into the Port of Orange was dredged in 1914 to accommodate large ships. Ship building during World War I contributed to the growth in population and economy. The Great Depression, not surprisingly, affected the city negatively, and the local economy was not boosted again until World War II.  A U.S. Naval Station was installed and additional housing was provided for thousands of defense workers and servicemen and their families. The population increased to just over 60,000 residents. USS Aulick was the first of 300 ships of various types built in Orange during the war.After the war, the peace-time population decreased to about 35,000.  At this time, the Navy Department announced it had selected Orange as one of eight locations where it would store reserve vessels. The area of the shipyards provided a favorable location, as the Sabine River furnished an abundant supply of fresh water to prevent saltwater corrosion.\nAlso during this period, the local chemical plants expanded, which boosted the economy. The chemical industry continues today as a leading source of revenue to the area.  The U.S. Naval Station became a Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in December 1975, retained 18.5 acres as a Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Center, but decommissioned the center completely in September 2008.The Port of Orange became the home to the USS Orleck, one of the few naval ships remaining that was built at the Orange shipyards during World War II. The city of Orange sustained a direct hit from Hurricane Rita in 2005, causing damage to the ship. The city decreed that the ship be moved because, as it claimed, the city needed the dock space. Orleck was not allowed to return to the port due to politics (as the city council was wanting the ship cut up and sold for scrap and had a long-running feud with the Restoration Association), so a new location was sought, including one in Arkansas and Lake Charles, Louisiana, for a new home.

It became a no. 2 chart hit for Jimmy Dorsey in 1957.\nThe version by Carl Ravell and his Orchestra, from a session on 4 June 1937, was the earliest recording of the song, although it is unclear whether it was the first released version.  The earliest popular versions of \"So Rare\" were the 1937 releases by Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians and by Gus Arnheim and his Coconut Grove Orchestra.Before it had been recorded or even published, Fred Astaire had sung \"So Rare\" on his radio show The Packard Hour. This was the recollection of Jess Oppenheimer, then a writer for the show, who recommended the song on behalf of his friend Jerry Herst, then an \"aspiring songwriter\". According to Oppenheimer, this led to \"So Rare\" being \"snapped up by a publisher who heard it on the program\".Since 1937, \"So Rare\" has been recorded by numerous artists, but it notably became a late-career hit in 1957 for Jimmy Dorsey, reaching #2 on Billboard magazine's pop charts, and #4 on the R&B singles chart.  Recorded on 11 November 1956 and released on the Cincinnati label Fraternity, Jimmy Dorsey's version, which had a decidedly rhythm and blues feel unlike the earlier versions, became the highest-charting song by a big band during the first decade of the rock and roll era. Credited on the label to \"Jimmy Dorsey with Orchestra and Chorus\", the vocals are by the Artie Malvin Singers. Billboard ranked this version as the No. 5 song for 1957.Less than two months after \"So Rare\" became a hit, Jimmy Dorsey died from lung cancer.", "hasanswer": true}]}

According to Richard Carpenter, he had to choose which songs he wanted to remake, and there was a big pile of 7-inch singles he had to listen to. When he encountered \"It's Going to Take Some Time\", he knew it would be a hit, and recorded it. The song peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Perone, the lyrics describe someone recovering from a relationship that has ended.  They contrast the current situation, where the singer sings that \"it's going to take some time this time\" with her future recovery from the sadness.  Perone interprets the syncopations of much of the music as reflecting her recovery, but notes that the smoother, unsyncopated music at the end of each verse bring her back to the present day reality.Actress Jessie Mueller, who portrayed King in the Broadway musical Beautiful: The Carole King Musical, regards \"It's Going to Take Some Time\" as one of her favorite King songs, adding that King \"knows how to write a breakup song!

It was Ray's second entirely original screenplay, after Kanchenjungha (1962). The story revolves around a matinee idol on a 24-hour train journey from Kolkata to Delhi to receive a national award. However, he ends up revealing his mistakes, insecurities and regrets to a young journalist, who realises that behind all his arrogant facade lies a deeply troubled man as his life's story is gradually revealed through seven flashbacks and two dreams. The film starring Uttam Kumar in main protagonist and Sharmila Tagore played second lead.\nIn Nayak, Uttam Kumar plays Arindam Mukherjee with such poise and ease that it appears as if he is portraying his own life on the celluloid. Ray gives us a vulnerable hero hiding behind his cocky, larger-than-life fa\u00e7ade. And, Kumar, to his credit, never misses a note during his challenging portrayal. He is well complemented by Sharmila Tagore who plays the character of Aditi to a tee. Aditi is the only person Arindam opens up to; the tantalizing conversations between the two characters offer some great food for thought. Ray uses the various interactions between the co-passengers to make us realize that the hypocrisies and follies of a star are not much different from that of an ordinary man. A few other characters in the movie merely provide a morality check.Satyajit Ray often used to say that he did not like making grand films, and that he would rather tell the story of the ordinary man, the man on the street. Like his films, his short stories too mirrored this preference of his \u2013 most of them describing the lives of ordinary men \u2013 all of whom were, without exception, very lonely. Why, then, did Ray decide to make Nayak (The Hero) \u2013 a film on the life of an insanely popular matinee idol, a brash, haughty young superstar riding the waves of popularity and enjoying it to the hilt? The answer is hidden in the many layers of the film itself \u2013 a film that is so rich, so deep and yet, told in such simple language that perhaps it would not be a mistake to claim that it featured among the best works of Satyajit Ray's illustrious career.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He composed his first soundtracks for the film Inaye Thedi, debut film of director turned still photographer Antony Eastman and actress Silk Smitha. It was Devarajan himself, who suggested Johnson to the director. Then came Bharathan's Parvathi and Balachandra Menon's Premageethangal. Premageethangal was a notable success with four of its songs \u2013 \"Swapnam Verumoru Swapnam\", \"Nee Nirayoo Jeevanil\", \"Muthum Mudipponnum\" and  \"Kalakalamozhi\" attaining cult status.\nHe came to prominence through his collaboration with Malayalam author and director Padmarajan. Koodevide was their first venture, which had one of the most famous songs of Johnson \"Aadivaa Kaatte\", a pathbreaking song in Malayalam music history. It was one of the first songs in Malayalam to so many western classical elements. The song was born out of Padmarajan's need for a western song for his innovative film. Song composition took place in Woodland's Hotel, Chennai. Another notable feature of this song was the lyrics by O. N. V. Kurup, who for the first time wrote lyrics for a pre-composed song. Johnson worked for 11 films with Padmarajan, including his last film Njan Gandharvan. This productive collaboration saw the detailed screenplay and cinematography of Padmarajan become a fertile ground for expressive musical narration and thematic scores for Johnson. This is seen in some of the greatest motion pictures of Malayalam cinema, like Nombarathipoovu (1987). Another notable collaboration of Johnson was with director Sathyan Anthikkad, with whom he associated in almost 25 films. He was able to provide some of his most popular songs with Anthikkad and this combo is widely accepted to be one of the greatest director-composer collaborations in Malayalam cinema. Acclaimed Malayalam director Bharathan also collaborated with him in multiple films including Parvathy, Palangal, Ormakkayi, Kattathe Kilikkoodu, Ente Upasana, Oru Minnaminunginte Nurunguvettam, Ozhivukalam, Malootty, Chamayam and Churam. His major other collaborations with directors include Mohan (Oru Katha Oru Nunakkatha, Sakshyam, Pakshe and Angane Oru Avadhikkalathu), Sibi Malayil (Kireedam, Chenkol, Dasaratham and Nee Varuvolam), Sreenivasan (Vadakkunokkiyantram and Chinthavishtayaya Shyamala), Lohithadas (Bhoothakkannadi, Kamal (Peruvannapurathe Visheshangal, Shubhayathra, Ee Puzhayum Kadannu and Paavam Paavam Rajakumaran), and Balachandra Menon (Shesham Kazhchayil, Premageethangal, Kilukilukkam, Kelkatha Shabdam and Nayam Vyakthamakkunnu).\nHe is also noted for his collaboration with the Malayalam lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri. Their association began in 1989 with Sathyan Anthikkad's social satire Varavelpu. Most of Johnson's notable works were in the late eighties and early nineties. In 1991, he scored a record number of 31 films, including 29 with Kaithapram. Johnson won National awards for two consecutive years. He won his first National Award for best music direction for the motion picture Ponthan Mada (1993). The next year he got his second National award for Sukrutham for the background score.\nAfter an extremely successful career of more than a decade, Johnson took a sabbatical from film scoring by the end of the nineties. The quantity of his works began perishing during this time.

The vocal range displayed by Ciara on \"I Bet\" spans two octaves, from the low note of (Eb3) up to the belted note of (Eb5).\nThe lyrical content in \"I Bet\" are based on subjects of betrayal, trust issues and infidelity in a romantic relationship. They are aimed at an ex-lover who took Ciara for granted, and see her relive a relationship gone awry. \"I Bet\" also details a story about life in the public eye. Described as a realest, scathing breakup song, its content feature the singer making a stand to tell-off an ex-lover for not appreciating her. \"I Bet\" goes through the motions of feeling bitter, by acting as a callout of her former love interest's new girlfriend, manifested in the line, \"Is that your bitch over there givin' me the ugly stare / The one with the silicone ass and the Brazilian hair\". Despite her ex-lover's wrongdoings, Ciara admits she still loves him, namely in the lyric, \"I'm singing this song 'cause I love you\u2026 Right now it's killing me 'cause now I have to find someone else when all I wanted was you\". The track's hook serves as a revelation that the singer's former lover will want her back, manifested in the lines, \"I bet you start loving me / As soon as I start loving someone else / Somebody better than you / I bet you start needing me / As soon as you see me with someone else / Somebody other than you\". Later in the song, it is revealed that in the situation, Ciara is not as boastful as the chorus would suggest; and tells a story of the pain of finding a new lover when her future was planned with her former one.\nRegarding the subject of the track's lyrics, a number of journalists opined that they were based on Future, and in part insulted him as a diss track. Some critics noted that \"I Bet\" was the first time the Ciara weighed in on her break-up with Future, and wrote that the track \"bit back at Future\" and was essentially Ciara's take on their split. Referring to \"I Bet\" and Future's \"Just like Bruddas\", Stereogum's Tim Breihan observed: \"Future and Ciara were the two halves of one of rap and R&B's greatest power couples. But now, their ugly public breakup has reached the point where they're both writing songs about it\". Rap-Up mentioned, \"a hurt CiCi sings about a lover who did her wrong, much like her ex-fianc\u00e9 Future\". The lyrics in \"I Bet\" were described by radio station WKYS as telling a very clear story of Ciara's feelings towards Future. While Larry Fitzmaurice of The Fader noted that the track's cutting lyrics also depicted that there was no love lost between Ciara and Future, and opined that the lines\u2014\"I mean, I would stay if you could tell the truth / But you can't / No matter how much time I ask\"\u2014served as a \"seriously withering burn\" in the former couple's relationship. Other critics opined that \"I Bet\" showcased Ciara as self-assured and working through her past relationship. Ciara has not confirmed or denied how \"I Bet\" was inspired by her relationship with Future, despite the personal weight that the track carries.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jeremiah Clarke (whose score is now lost) set the original ode to music.\nHandel composed the music in January 1736, and the work received its premiere at the Covent Garden Theatre, London, on 19 February 1736. In its original form it contained three concertos: a concerto in B flat major in 3 movements for \"Harp, Lute, Lyrichord and other Instruments\" HWV 294 for performance after the recitative Timotheus, plac'd on high in Part I; a concerto grosso in C major in 4 movements for oboes, bassoon and strings, now known as the \"Concerto in Alexander's Feast\" HWV 318, performed between Parts I and II; and an organ concerto HWV 289 in G minor and major in 4 movements for chamber organ, oboes, bassoon and strings performed after the chorus Let old Timotheus yield the prize in Part II. The organ concerto and harp concerto were published in 1738 by John Walsh as the first and last of the Handel organ concertos Op.4. Handel revised the music for performances in 1739, 1742 and 1751.  Donald Burrows has discussed Handel's revisions to the score.The work describes a banquet held by Alexander the Great and his mistress Tha\u00efs in the captured Persian city of Persepolis, during which the musician Timotheus sings and plays his lyre, arousing various moods in Alexander until he is finally incited to burn the city down in revenge for his dead Greek soldiers.\nThe piece was a great success and it encouraged Handel to make the transition from writing Italian operas to English choral works.

It was Devarajan himself, who suggested Johnson to the director. Then came Bharathan's Parvathi and Balachandra Menon's Premageethangal. Premageethangal was a notable success with four of its songs \u2013 \"Swapnam Verumoru Swapnam\", \"Nee Nirayoo Jeevanil\", \"Muthum Mudipponnum\" and  \"Kalakalamozhi\" attaining cult status.\nHe came to prominence through his collaboration with Malayalam author and director Padmarajan. Koodevide was their first venture, which had one of the most famous songs of Johnson \"Aadivaa Kaatte\", a pathbreaking song in Malayalam music history. It was one of the first songs in Malayalam to so many western classical elements. The song was born out of Padmarajan's need for a western song for his innovative film. Song composition took place in Woodland's Hotel, Chennai. Another notable feature of this song was the lyrics by O. N. V. Kurup, who for the first time wrote lyrics for a pre-composed song. Johnson worked for 11 films with Padmarajan, including his last film Njan Gandharvan. This productive collaboration saw the detailed screenplay and cinematography of Padmarajan become a fertile ground for expressive musical narration and thematic scores for Johnson. This is seen in some of the greatest motion pictures of Malayalam cinema, like Nombarathipoovu (1987). Another notable collaboration of Johnson was with director Sathyan Anthikkad, with whom he associated in almost 25 films.

His major other collaborations with directors include Mohan (Oru Katha Oru Nunakkatha, Sakshyam, Pakshe and Angane Oru Avadhikkalathu), Sibi Malayil (Kireedam, Chenkol, Dasaratham and Nee Varuvolam), Sreenivasan (Vadakkunokkiyantram and Chinthavishtayaya Shyamala), Lohithadas (Bhoothakkannadi, Kamal (Peruvannapurathe Visheshangal, Shubhayathra, Ee Puzhayum Kadannu and Paavam Paavam Rajakumaran), and Balachandra Menon (Shesham Kazhchayil, Premageethangal, Kilukilukkam, Kelkatha Shabdam and Nayam Vyakthamakkunnu).\nHe is also noted for his collaboration with the Malayalam lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri. Their association began in 1989 with Sathyan Anthikkad's social satire Varavelpu. Most of Johnson's notable works were in the late eighties and early nineties. In 1991, he scored a record number of 31 films, including 29 with Kaithapram. Johnson won National awards for two consecutive years. He won his first National Award for best music direction for the motion picture Ponthan Mada (1993). The next year he got his second National award for Sukrutham for the background score.\nAfter an extremely successful career of more than a decade, Johnson took a sabbatical from film scoring by the end of the nineties. The quantity of his works began perishing during this time. By the beginning of the 2000s, he didn't sign any new projects that even his most noted collaborator Sathyan Anthikkad had to find a new composer. In 2003 he did the background score for the NFDC movie Parinamam (The Change) directed by P. Venu.In 2004, he sang the song \"Theekuruvi\" from Kangalal Kaidhu Sei, which was composed by A. R. Rahman. Perhaps it is the only song recorded by him for any composer other than himself.

This attribution has since been proved to be spurious. Some of the music may have been by Domenico Gallo, Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer, Carlo Ignazio Monza and Alessandro Parisotti.Conductor Ernest Ansermet wrote to Stravinsky in 1919 about the project. The composer initially did not like the idea of music by Pergolesi, but once he studied the scores, which Diaghilev had found in libraries in Naples and London, he changed his mind. Stravinsky adapted the older music to a more modern style by borrowing specific themes and textures, but interjecting his modern rhythms, cadences, and harmonies.\nPulcinella marked the beginning of Stravinsky's second phase as a composer, his neoclassical period. He wrote: \n\nPulcinella was my discovery of the past, the epiphany through which the whole of my late work became possible. It was a backward look, of course\u2014the first of many love affairs in that direction\u2014but it was a look in the mirror, too.\nThe ballet was revived and revised by New York City Ballet's balletmasters George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins for their 1972 Stravinsky Festival.

Chiba's closest allies are Doctor Toratar\u014d Shima, the chief of the department, and Doctor K\u014dsaku Tokita, the inventor of the DC Mini.\nPaprika counsels Detective Toshimi Konakawa, who is plagued by a recurring dream. She gives Konakawa a card with the name of a website on it. Because they are unfinished prototypes, the DC Minis lack access restrictions, allowing anyone to enter another person's dreams, which poses grave consequences when they are stolen. Shima goes on a nonsensical tirade and jumps through a window, nearly killing himself. Upon examining Shima's dream, which is a parade of random objects, Tokita recognizes his assistant, Kei Himuro, which confirms their suspicion that the theft was an inside job.\nWhen two other scientists fall victim to the DC Mini, the company's chairman, Doctor Seijir\u014d Inui, who was against the project to begin with, bans the use of the device. This fails to hinder the crazed parade, now inside Himuro's dream, which claims Tokita. Paprika and Shima discover that Himuro is only an empty shell. The real culprit is Inui, who believes that he must protect dreams from humankind's influence through dream therapy, with the help of Doctor Morio Osanai.\nPaprika is captured by the pair after an exhausting chase. Osanai obsessively confesses his love for Chiba and peels away Paprika's skin to reveal Chiba underneath. However, he is interrupted by the outraged Inui who demands that they finish off Chiba; as the two share Osanai's body, they battle for control. Konakawa enters the dream and flees with Chiba back into his own recurring dream. Osanai gives chase, which ends in Konakawa shooting Osanai to take control of the dream. The act kills Osanai's physical body in the real world.\nDreams and reality begin to merge. The dream parade runs amok in the city, and reality starts to unravel. Shima is nearly killed by a giant Japanese doll, but is saved by Paprika, who has become separate from Chiba. Amidst the chaos, Tokita, in the form of a giant robot, eats Chiba and prepares to do the same to Paprika. A ghostly apparition of Chiba appears and reveals that she has been in love with Tokita and has been repressing these emotions. She comes to terms with her repressed desires, reconciling herself with the part of her that is Paprika. Inui returns in the form of a giant humanoid nightmare, reveals his twisted dreams of nihilistic omnipotence, and threatens to darken the world with his delusions. Paprika throws herself into Tokita's body. A baby emerges from the robotic shell and consumes Inui, aging into a fully-grown combination of Chiba and Paprika as she does so, then fades away, ending the nightmare.\nIn the real world, Chiba sits at Tokita's bedside as he wakes up. Later, Konakawa visits the website from Paprika's card and receives a message from Paprika: \"Atsuko will change her surname to Tokita... and I suggest watching the movie Dreaming Kids.\" Konakawa enters a movie theater and purchases a ticket for Dreaming Kids.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Premageethangal was a notable success with four of its songs \u2013 \"Swapnam Verumoru Swapnam\", \"Nee Nirayoo Jeevanil\", \"Muthum Mudipponnum\" and  \"Kalakalamozhi\" attaining cult status.\nHe came to prominence through his collaboration with Malayalam author and director Padmarajan. Koodevide was their first venture, which had one of the most famous songs of Johnson \"Aadivaa Kaatte\", a pathbreaking song in Malayalam music history. It was one of the first songs in Malayalam to so many western classical elements. The song was born out of Padmarajan's need for a western song for his innovative film. Song composition took place in Woodland's Hotel, Chennai. Another notable feature of this song was the lyrics by O. N. V. Kurup, who for the first time wrote lyrics for a pre-composed song. Johnson worked for 11 films with Padmarajan, including his last film Njan Gandharvan. This productive collaboration saw the detailed screenplay and cinematography of Padmarajan become a fertile ground for expressive musical narration and thematic scores for Johnson. This is seen in some of the greatest motion pictures of Malayalam cinema, like Nombarathipoovu (1987). Another notable collaboration of Johnson was with director Sathyan Anthikkad, with whom he associated in almost 25 films. He was able to provide some of his most popular songs with Anthikkad and this combo is widely accepted to be one of the greatest director-composer collaborations in Malayalam cinema. Acclaimed Malayalam director Bharathan also collaborated with him in multiple films including Parvathy, Palangal, Ormakkayi, Kattathe Kilikkoodu, Ente Upasana, Oru Minnaminunginte Nurunguvettam, Ozhivukalam, Malootty, Chamayam and Churam. His major other collaborations with directors include Mohan (Oru Katha Oru Nunakkatha, Sakshyam, Pakshe and Angane Oru Avadhikkalathu), Sibi Malayil (Kireedam, Chenkol, Dasaratham and Nee Varuvolam), Sreenivasan (Vadakkunokkiyantram and Chinthavishtayaya Shyamala), Lohithadas (Bhoothakkannadi, Kamal (Peruvannapurathe Visheshangal, Shubhayathra, Ee Puzhayum Kadannu and Paavam Paavam Rajakumaran), and Balachandra Menon (Shesham Kazhchayil, Premageethangal, Kilukilukkam, Kelkatha Shabdam and Nayam Vyakthamakkunnu).\nHe is also noted for his collaboration with the Malayalam lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri. Their association began in 1989 with Sathyan Anthikkad's social satire Varavelpu. Most of Johnson's notable works were in the late eighties and early nineties. In 1991, he scored a record number of 31 films, including 29 with Kaithapram. Johnson won National awards for two consecutive years. He won his first National Award for best music direction for the motion picture Ponthan Mada (1993). The next year he got his second National award for Sukrutham for the background score.\nAfter an extremely successful career of more than a decade, Johnson took a sabbatical from film scoring by the end of the nineties. The quantity of his works began perishing during this time. By the beginning of the 2000s, he didn't sign any new projects that even his most noted collaborator Sathyan Anthikkad had to find a new composer. In 2003 he did the background score for the NFDC movie Parinamam (The Change) directed by P. Venu.In 2004, he sang the song \"Theekuruvi\" from Kangalal Kaidhu Sei, which was composed by A. R.

Cherubini began the composition of the overture in Paris in February and finished the score in London the following month.  He conducted the premiere on April 3, and the work enjoyed a warm reception.  By contrast, Cherubini\u2019s new Symphony in D major, unveiled some weeks later, proved a decisive failure.  The irony is that today the Symphony is heard with some frequency (several recordings have long been available) while the overture remains formidably obscure.\nThe Overture in G major has, however, a full measure of the dramatic atmosphere that characterizes his opera overtures. Indeed, after the stately opening gestures of its Larghetto introduction, an undercurrent of unease becomes apparent, conveyed by chromatic twists in the bass, and by an early turn from G into E-flat, which mixes G-minor vocabulary into the major-mode context. Strings are muted throughout the introduction. As foreshadowed, a fiery G minor Allegro spiritoso soon appears, bristling with energy, although the main theme is somewhat formulaic. The formidable quality of Cherubini\u2019s mind, however, may be savored in an elegant contrapuntal woodwind interplay that prepares the theme\u2019s counterstatement:\n\nFollowing a dramatic climax, a transition passage promises a second subject in B-flat major. But Cherubini sidesteps with a chorale-like string theme in warm, distant D-flat major:\n\nA flowing B-flat major theme follows, and after a triumphant exposition close, the development begins with a passage that transforms the chorale into new theme (see example), delivered by antiphonal horns against pattering bassoons. The development section is pithy and brief. In the reprise, Cherubini discards the exposition's sidestepping modulation as a twice-told tale, and, moreover, replaces the initial second-subject theme with the quoted development variant. A presto coda begins with what is in effect an aristocratic forebear of a Rossini-crescendo, building from pianissimo to fortissimo, and bold reminders of G minor punctuate before the overture ends in triumph.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

In addition, the team wanted to create a Tales experience that people could play on the go. Later, it was stated that the compression of features for Tempest and the staff's inexperience with the Nintendo DS caused multiple problems, including technical issues. The title, \"Tempest\", was derived from the concept of chaotic events and feelings. Makoto Yoshizumi, the producer for Tales of the Abyss, came over to produce the game once Abyss was completed. Tempest was the first Tales title to be developed for the Nintendo DS. It was developed by Japanese game studio Dimps. In contrast to previous Tales games, which featured a sizable amount of voice acting, Tempest restricted voice work to the execution of abilities and the completion of cooking.The characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata and Daigo Okomura. Tempest was Inomata's fifth time designing for the series. As part of her design, she created the characters with the DS graphics in mind. Okomura, a minor designer for the series, was responsible for designing the characters Albert and Rommy. In contrast to previous titles, which had purely animated openings, the game's opening cutscene used a mixture of CGI sequences created using the in-game graphics and animated segments by Production I.G. The scenario was written by Shino Taira, Riku Okimata and Makio Kurita. Okimata was brought into the writing process halfway through production. The overall theme of coexistence between different nations and peoples was carried over directly from Abyss and Tales of Rebirth. Its characteristic genre name, a recurring feature in the series, was Tamashii o yobisamasu RPG (\u9b42\u3092\u547c\u3073\u899a\u307e\u3059RPG, RPG that Awakens the Soul). One of the main ambitions for the story was to make it comparable with one of the home console Tales games despite the platform and development goals. The game's music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, the main composer for the Tales series. As his first work for the DS, Sakuraba found composing the music a challenge. One of the main problems was the limited sound capacity of the platform. As a result, it used a high degree of pop music. The title's theme song, \"VS\", was performed by misono, a singer who had previously performed the theme song for Tales of Symphonia while she was still a member of Japanese band Day After Tomorrow.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He composed his first soundtracks for the film Inaye Thedi, debut film of director turned still photographer Antony Eastman and actress Silk Smitha. It was Devarajan himself, who suggested Johnson to the director. Then came Bharathan's Parvathi and Balachandra Menon's Premageethangal. Premageethangal was a notable success with four of its songs \u2013 \"Swapnam Verumoru Swapnam\", \"Nee Nirayoo Jeevanil\", \"Muthum Mudipponnum\" and  \"Kalakalamozhi\" attaining cult status.\nHe came to prominence through his collaboration with Malayalam author and director Padmarajan. Koodevide was their first venture, which had one of the most famous songs of Johnson \"Aadivaa Kaatte\", a pathbreaking song in Malayalam music history. It was one of the first songs in Malayalam to so many western classical elements. The song was born out of Padmarajan's need for a western song for his innovative film. Song composition took place in Woodland's Hotel, Chennai. Another notable feature of this song was the lyrics by O. N. V. Kurup, who for the first time wrote lyrics for a pre-composed song. Johnson worked for 11 films with Padmarajan, including his last film Njan Gandharvan. This productive collaboration saw the detailed screenplay and cinematography of Padmarajan become a fertile ground for expressive musical narration and thematic scores for Johnson. This is seen in some of the greatest motion pictures of Malayalam cinema, like Nombarathipoovu (1987). Another notable collaboration of Johnson was with director Sathyan Anthikkad, with whom he associated in almost 25 films. He was able to provide some of his most popular songs with Anthikkad and this combo is widely accepted to be one of the greatest director-composer collaborations in Malayalam cinema. Acclaimed Malayalam director Bharathan also collaborated with him in multiple films including Parvathy, Palangal, Ormakkayi, Kattathe Kilikkoodu, Ente Upasana, Oru Minnaminunginte Nurunguvettam, Ozhivukalam, Malootty, Chamayam and Churam. His major other collaborations with directors include Mohan (Oru Katha Oru Nunakkatha, Sakshyam, Pakshe and Angane Oru Avadhikkalathu), Sibi Malayil (Kireedam, Chenkol, Dasaratham and Nee Varuvolam), Sreenivasan (Vadakkunokkiyantram and Chinthavishtayaya Shyamala), Lohithadas (Bhoothakkannadi, Kamal (Peruvannapurathe Visheshangal, Shubhayathra, Ee Puzhayum Kadannu and Paavam Paavam Rajakumaran), and Balachandra Menon (Shesham Kazhchayil, Premageethangal, Kilukilukkam, Kelkatha Shabdam and Nayam Vyakthamakkunnu).\nHe is also noted for his collaboration with the Malayalam lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri. Their association began in 1989 with Sathyan Anthikkad's social satire Varavelpu. Most of Johnson's notable works were in the late eighties and early nineties. In 1991, he scored a record number of 31 films, including 29 with Kaithapram. Johnson won National awards for two consecutive years. He won his first National Award for best music direction for the motion picture Ponthan Mada (1993). The next year he got his second National award for Sukrutham for the background score.\nAfter an extremely successful career of more than a decade, Johnson took a sabbatical from film scoring by the end of the nineties. The quantity of his works began perishing during this time. By the beginning of the 2000s, he didn't sign any new projects that even his most noted collaborator Sathyan Anthikkad had to find a new composer. In 2003 he did the background score for the NFDC movie Parinamam (The Change) directed by P. Venu.In 2004, he sang the song \"Theekuruvi\" from Kangalal Kaidhu Sei, which was composed by A. R. Rahman. Perhaps it is the only song recorded by him for any composer other than himself.

The plot derives from William Shakespeare's King Lear and includes segments based on legends of the daimy\u014d M\u014dri Motonari. The film stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging Sengoku-period warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons.\nLike most of Kurosawa's work in the 1970s and 80s, Ran is an international production, in this case a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films, and Greenwich Film Productions. Production planning went through a long period of preparation. Kurosawa conceived the idea of Ran in the mid-1970s, when he read about Motonari, who was famous for having three highly loyal sons. Kurosawa devised a plot in which the sons become antagonists of their father. Although the film became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play King Lear, Kurosawa began using it only after he had started preparations for Ran. Following these preparations, Kurosawa filmed Dersu Uzala in 1975, followed by Kagemusha in the early 1980s, before securing financial backing to film Ran.\nRan was Kurosawa's third encounter with Shakespeare during his career. In 1957, Kurosawa directed Throne of Blood, based on Shakespeare's Macbeth. In 1960, he directed the film The Bad Sleep Well, based on Hamlet. Despite the changes in setting and language, all three films have received critical acclaim.\nAs Kurosawa's last epic, Ran has often been cited as among his finest achievements and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. With a budget of $11\u201312 million, it was the most expensive film in the history of Japanese cinema upon its release. Ran was previewed on  May 31, 1985, at the Tokyo International Film Festival before its release on June 1, 1985, in Japan. The film was hailed for its powerful images and use of color;  costume designer Emi Wada won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design for her work on Ran, and Kurosawa received his only career nomination for Best Director.

Extremely introverted, she is teased by Aunt Em for having delayed moving out to start her life as an adult (\"Can I Go On?\"). While Dorothy cleans up after the meal, her dog Toto runs out the open kitchen door into a snowstorm. She succeeds in retrieving him but finds herself trapped in the storm. A magical whirlwind made of snow materializes and transports them to the land of Oz, depicted as a dystopian version of New York City.\nAs Dorothy descends from the atmosphere, she smashes through an electric \"Oz\" sign which falls upon and kills Evermean, the Wicked Witch of the East who rules Munchkinland. As a result, she frees the Munchkins who populate the playground into which she lands. Dorothy soon meets the Munchkins' main benefactress, Miss One, the Good Witch of the North, a magical \"numbers runner\" who gives her Evermean's charmed silver slippers. Dorothy declares she just wants to get home to Aunt Em. Miss One urges her to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and seek the help of the powerful \"Wiz\" (\"He's the Wiz\"). After telling her never to take the silver shoes off, Miss One and the Munchkins disappear and Dorothy is left to search for the road on her own (\"Soon As I Get Home\").\nThe next morning, Dorothy happens upon a scarecrow made of garbage and saves him from being teased by a group of humanoid crows (\"You Can't Win\"). The Scarecrow hopes the Wiz might be able to give him the one thing he feels that he lacks: a brain. They discover the yellow brick road and begin their journey to the Emerald City (\u201dEase on Down the Road\u201d). Along the way, they meet a man made out of tin in an abandoned amusement park (\"If I Could Feel\"/\"Slide Some Oil to Me\") and a cowardly lion, banished from the jungle (\"I'm a Mean Ol' Lion\"). The Tin Man and Lion join them on their quest to find the Wiz, hoping to gain a heart and courage, respectively. En route to the Emerald City, the foursome escape from a haunted subway station and a group of flamboyant prostitutes known as the \"Poppy Girls\", who seduce the Lion. The Lion feels deeply ashamed of leading Dorothy into a trap, but she and the rest of the gang cheer him up (\"Be a Lion\").\nFinally reaching the Emerald City, the foursome are granted an audience with the Wiz, who appears to them as a giant fire-breathing metallic head. He will only grant their wishes if they kill Evermean\u2019s sister, Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West, who runs a sweatshop in the underground sewers of Oz. After they leave, a man is seen peeking out of the metallic head.\nBefore they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out her army of Flying Monkeys to capture them (\"Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News\"). Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and hangs the Lion up by his tail in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch. The sprinklers put out the fire and melt Evillene. With Evillene dead, her spells lose their power, resulting in the freedom of all her sweat shop workers and prisoners (\"A Brand New Day\").\nThe Flying Monkeys give Dorothy and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City. Upon going in the back entrance, they discover that the Wiz is actually Herman Smith, a washed-up politician from Atlantic City who came to Oz by accident in a hot air balloon. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion are distraught that they will never receive their brain, heart, and courage, but Dorothy makes them realize that they already have had these things all along (\"Believe in Yourself\") even as she fears she will never find her own way home. Glinda the Good Witch of the South appears and implores her to use the magic of the silver slippers (\"Believe in Yourself (Reprise)\"). After thanking Glinda and saying goodbye to her friends, she reminisces about home.

The plot follows employees of an exclusive apartment building who lose their pensions in the Ponzi scheme of a Wall Street businessman and enlist the aid of a criminal, a bankrupt businessman, and an immigrant maid to break into his apartment and steal back their money while avoiding the FBI agents in charge of his case.\nTower Heist began development as early as 2005, based on an idea by Murphy that would star him and an all-black cast of comedians as a heist group who rob Trump International Hotel and Tower.

Set in 1941, it stars John Turturro in the title role as a young New York City playwright who is hired to write scripts for a film studio in Hollywood, and John Goodman as Charlie Meadows, the insurance salesman who lives next door at the run-down Hotel Earle.\nThe Coens wrote the screenplay for Barton Fink in three weeks while experiencing writer's block during the writing of Miller's Crossing. They began filming soon after Miller's Crossing was finished. The film is influenced by works of several earlier directors, particularly  Roman Polanski's Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976).\nBarton Fink had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1991. In a rare sweep, it won the Palme d'Or as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor (Turturro). Although the film was a box office bomb, only grossing $6 million against its $9 million budget, it received positive reviews and was nominated for three Academy Awards.\nProminent themes of Barton Fink include the writing process; slavery and conditions of labor in creative industries; superficial distinctions between high culture and low culture; and the relationship of intellectuals with \"the common man\". The diverse elements of the film have led it to defy efforts at genre classification, with the work being variously referred to as a film noir, a horror film, a K\u00fcnstlerroman, and a buddy film. It contains various literary allusions and religious overtones, as well as references to many real-life people and events \u2013 most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner, of whom the characters of Barton Fink and W. P. Mayhew, respectively, are often seen as fictional representations. Several features of the film's narrative, particularly an image of a woman at the beach which recurs throughout, have sparked much commentary, with the Coens acknowledging some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any single message in the film.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The music, composed by David Raksin for the 1944 movie Laura, which starred Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, is heard frequently in the movie. The film's director, Otto Preminger, had originally wanted to use Duke Ellington's \"Sophisticated Lady\" as the theme, but Raksin was not convinced that it was suitable. Angered, Preminger gave Raksin one weekend to compose an alternative melody. Raksin later said, and maintained for the rest of his days, that when, over that weekend, his wife sent him a \"Dear John\" letter, the haunting theme seemed to write itself.The lyrics were written by Johnny Mercer after the film made the tune popular, so he had to title the song \"Laura\". According to Mercer, he had not yet seen the movie when he wrote the lyrics but was aware that it was a romantic, somewhat haunting story.\nLaura is the face in the misty light, footsteps that you hear down the hall\nThe laugh that floats on the summer night that you can never quite recall\nAnd you see Laura on a train that is passing through, those eyes how familiar they seem\nShe gave your very first kiss to you, that was Laura but she's only a dreamThe song became a jazz standard and has been recorded more than 400 times. Some of the best-known versions are by Woody Herman, Dave Brubeck, Johnny Johnston, Emil Newman, David Rose, Billy Eckstine, Charlie Parker, J. J. Johnson, Carly Simon, Frank Sinatra, Spike Jones and Julie London (included on her 1955 debut album Julie Is Her Name, Vol. 1).

The song is one of the most famous of the Second World War era, and resonated with servicemen going off to fight as well as their families and loved ones.\nThe song was published by Michael Ross Limited, whose directors included Louis Carris, Ross Parker and Norman Keen. Keen, an English pianist also collaborated with Parker and Hughie Charles on \"We'll Meet Again\" and many other songs published by the company, including \"There'll Always Be an England\" and \"I'm In Love For The Last Time\". The song's original recording featured Lynn accompanied by Arthur Young on Hammond Novachord (an early electronic keyboard), while a rerecording in 1953 featured a more lavish instrumentation and a chorus of British Armed Forces personnel.The song gave its name to the 1943 musical film We'll Meet Again in which Lynn played the lead role (see 1943 in music). Lynn's 1953 recording is featured in the final scene of Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Dr. Strangelove \u2013 with a bitter irony, as the song accompanies a nuclear holocaust that wipes out humanity. It was also used in the closing scenes of the 1986 BBC television serial The Singing Detective. British director John Schlesinger used the song in his 1979 World War II film Yanks, which is about British citizens and American soldiers during the military buildup in the UK as the Allies prepare for the Normandy landings.\nDuring the Cold War, Lynn's recording was included in the package of music and programmes held in 20 underground radio stations of the BBC's Wartime Broadcasting Service (WTBS), designed to provide public information and morale-boosting broadcasts for 100 days after a nuclear attack. The song reached number 29 on the U.S. charts. Lynn sang the song in London on the 60th anniversary of VE Day in 2005.\nIn April 2020, a charity duet with Katherine Jenkins, released in 2014, reached number 72 on the UK Singles Chart, with proceeds going to National Health Service charities.

He deemed it \"a constantly fast entertainment with furious dancing, catchy tunes...excellent singing, and genuine excitement.\"The 1974 production opened to mostly negative reviews. Some critics had begun to consider Rigby's revivals formulaic; Clive Barnes of The New York Times derisively pronounced Good News, and shows like it, \"prefabricated...nostalgia\", and Martin Gottfried of the New York Post deemed it \"a joyless, mechanical reproduction\". The book was harshly criticized; Barnes pronounced it \"a terrible book\" with \"jokes obvious enough to give banana skins a bad name\", and Time referred to it as an \"ancient flapdoodle of a plot\". Critics also questioned the practice of interpolating songs from other shows. Walter Kerr opined that preserving the original score was vital to the character of a revival, stating, \"the only reason for remounting vehicles that have half-vanished...is to get beyond all that is dated into the specific textures of the scores that haven't...there's no point for enduring banality in a book if all you're going to get in return is a random rummage through an attic that produces a perhaps bountiful but essentially characterless heap\".Critics differed on what they considered the show's good points to be. In the Daily News, Douglas Watt declared, \"the dancing is the best part of the show\" but deemed the vocal arrangements \"too-busy\". Gottfried, however, said the show was \"stolen by the vocal arranger\", whom he credited with \"dazzling harmonizations and stylings\". He disliked the staging, saying it was suitable \"for a concert rather than theater and [allowed] little acting\". Barnes, however, pronounced the staging \"very good\", saying, \"It has a sense of style, a sense of period and a few bursts of energy that really work\". Barnes praised the sets and costumes, while Watt asserted that the costumes seemed to vacillate between the '20s and '30s and that the sets were \"uninteresting and cheap-looking\".Alice Faye and Gene Nelson's performances received mixed reviews. Watt said that Faye \"doesn't add much to the show,\" and Gottfried asserted that \"combined,[Faye and Nelson] have the stage presence of a balcony seat\". Time said that \"[Faye and Nelson] only succeed in underlining the show's decrepitude.\" Barnes, however, stated that though Faye \"is not the most animated leading lady...her light baritone voice is pleasing, and she unquestionably dances with the guts of a Ruby Keeler. Gene Nelson...has enormous personal charm and stage professionalism.\" Kerr said that Faye \"sounds winsome and welcome...she is a composed performer and a willing workhorse\". The actors portraying the young college students were generally well received. In his review, Barnes praised Jana Robbins, Barbara Lail, Marti Rolph, Scott Stevenson, and Wayne Bryan for their performances as the principal student characters. In Newsweek, Jack Kroll declared, \"One's heart goes out to the young people in a show like this, like Barbara Lail and Marti Rolph, whose drive and energy really must carry [the show]\". Marti Rolph, in the role of Connie Lane, received particular praise from critics. Watt declared, \"The only really good singing voice among the principals belongs to Marti Rolph\". Gottfried wrote, \"The only standout, really, is Marti Rolph--the ingenue--who has a gorgeous voice and manages to inject pert spirit into a spiritless show\".The 1993 Musical Theatre of Wichita production was well received by local critics. In The Wichita Eagle, Susan L. Rife wrote that the new production was a \"lavish ode to the outright goofiness of the Roaring '20s\", praising the actors' exuberance and the choreography.

At Metacritic, the game holds an 86/100 score based on 56 critic reviews.Emily Morganti for Adventure Gamers commented that Gone Home had a \"realistic, engrossing story that's beautifully told through environmental clues and audio narration\" and that \"many people read books for the opportunity to see life through someone else\u2019s eyes, but it\u2019s rare for a game to do it as well as this one does.\" The Financial Post's Matthew Braga also noted that \"This is a game that some will hold up as forward-thinking evidence in the ongoing debate of games-as-art\", adding that the game was made to \"plumb the depths of experience outside of gaming's typically targeted white, male, youthful core.\" However, Eurogamer editor Oli Welsh stated \"The Fullbright Company has built a fine house for intimate storytelling in games, but it hasn't found the story to live in it yet.\"The game's LGBT themes were praised. Fullbright reported receiving numerous feedback not only from LGBT players of the game that appreciated how they told the story and how such people have to do deal with rejection by their family, but also from players who had opposed LGBT rights who found the game presented the issues related to LGBT to change their mind on the subject. Fullbright also received some criticism from players from focusing on LGBT themes at the expense of other story elements. Due to statements made by the organizers of PAX Prime that Fulbright considered derogatory towards LGBT, the company pulled out of showing Gone Home at the Indie MEGABOOTH showcase during the 2013 PAX Prime event, stressing the importance of respecting LGBT issues. In the wake of this, PAX announced that it would establish Diversity Hubs at its future events for \"attendees to find information related to issues surrounding women, LGBTQ, people of color, disabled people, and mental health issues in gaming\".Some reporters have considered the question of whether Gone Home should be considered a video game, as it lacks the normal interactivity one would normally have with a video game. Gaynor asserted that Gone Home was specifically developed for the video game medium, stating that they considered it an \"edited discussion\" between Fullbright and the player, as \"[t]he content that you encounter appears differently than for someone else. It is unique to each user and their interpretation. The interactivity of it makes the experience unique to yourself.\" Gaynor used the example of the ability to turn lights on or off in any room in the house as an example of this. They included this interactivity as they had developed the game, they found that this gave a means for players to track if they had been within a room before or not, since the house starts otherwise dark, so he considered this one method by which they know what players would likely want to do and providing them means for them to do that, thus making the experience interactive. The lack of interactivity led to Gone Home to be called \"walking simulators\" at its release, though since then, the industry has come to accept \"walking simulators\" to describe similarly contemplative narrative games with little direct interactivity, like The Stanley Parable, Firewatch, and What Remains of Edith Finch. Gone Home's approach to exploratory storytelling was a point of influence for parts of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Prey. Polygon named Gone Home among most important game of the 2010s for how it shifted games to focus on exploration and narrative over purely active gameplay.Due to both the atypical nature of Gone Home and its narrative centered around LGBT issues, it became a central point of discussion at the onset of the Gamergate controversy in August 2014. A portion of video game players, some who supported the Gamergate movement, criticized games like Gone Home and Depression Quest for lacking the qualities of normal video games while earning praise from the gaming press, as well as including topics like LGBT issues. Critics countered that these elements are part of considering video games as an art form, demonstrating how the medium is changing.", "hasanswer": false}]}

SFX called it a \"brave episode to air so early, but it works\", praising the way the alien concepts were reminiscent to the classic series. However, the reviewer wrote that \"the full drama of the event is never quite captured\" and \"the murder plot...never quite takes flight, but it provides the framework for some brilliant scenes\". In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described \"The End of the World\" as \"sheer, unadulterated fun\", particularly praising the emotional connection that was built between the Doctor and Rose. Burk felt that there could have been more of a build-up to the Cassandra revelation, but commented that \"a lot of the success of the story\" was due to her. Burk's co-author Robert Smith added that the episode allowed Eccleston to shine by offering the Doctor a wide range of emotions. Despite their positive reviews, Burk and Smith noted that the switch at the end of the hallway with giant fans was \"contrived\" and \"silly\".

(1985), and the critically acclaimed adventure game The Legend of Zelda (1986), the company began work on an action game. The word \"Metroid\" is a portmanteau of the words \"metro\" and \"android\". It was co-developed by Nintendo's Research and Development 1 division and Intelligent Systems, and produced by Gunpei Yokoi. Metroid was directed by Satoru Okada and Masao Yamamoto (credited as \"Yamamoto\"), and featured music written by Hirokazu Tanaka (credited as \"Hip Tanaka\"). The scenario was created by Makoto Kano (credited with his last name), and character design was done by Hiroji Kiyotake (credited with his last name), Hirofumi Matsuoka (credited as \"New Matsuoka\"), and Yoshio Sakamoto (credited as \"Shikamoto\"). The character design for Samus Aran was created by Kiyotake.The production was described as a \"very free working environment\" by Tanaka, who stated that, though being the composer, he also gave input for the graphics and helped name areas. Partway through development, one of the developers asked the others, \"Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?\" This idea was incorporated into the game, though the English-language instruction manual for the game uses only the pronoun \"he\" in reference to Samus. Ridley Scott's 1979 horror film Alien was described by Sakamoto as a \"huge influence\" after the game's world had been created. The development staff was affected by the work of the film's creature designer H. R. Giger, and found his creations to be fitting for the theme. Still, there were problems that threatened timely progress and eventually led Sakamoto to be \"forcefully asked to participate\" by his superiors, hoping his previous experience could help the team. Sakamoto stated he figured out a way to bypass the limited resources and time to leverage existing game media assets \"to create variation and an exciting experience\".Nintendo attempted to distinguish Metroid from other games by making it a nonlinear adventure-based game, in which exploration was a crucial part of the experience. The game often requires that the player retrace steps to progress, forcing the player to scroll the screen in all directions, as with most contemporary games. Metroid is considered one of the first video games to impress a feeling of desperation and solitude on the player. Following The Legend of Zelda, Metroid helped pioneer the idea of acquiring tools to strengthen characters and help progress through the game. Until then, most ability-enhancing power-ups like the Power Shot in Gauntlet (1985) and the Starman in Super Mario Bros. offer only temporary boosts to characters, and they are not required to complete the game. In Metroid, however, items are permanent fixtures that lasted until the end. In particular, missiles and the ice beam are required to finish the game.After defeating Mother Brain, the game presents one of five ending screens based on the time to completion. Metroid is one of the first games to contain multiple endings. In the third, fourth, and fifth endings, Samus Aran appears without her suit, and for the first time, reveals herself to be a woman. In Japan, the Disk Card media used by the Famicom Disk System allows players up to three different saved game slots in Metroid, similar to The Legend of Zelda in the West. Use of an internal battery to manage files was not fully realized in time for Metroid's international release. The Western versions of Metroid use a password system that was new to the industry at the time, in which players write down a 24-letter code and re-enter it into the game when they wish to continue a previous session. Codes also allow for cheats, such as \"NARPAS SWORD\" and \"JUSTIN BAILEY\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

(Although the exact date of the composition remains unknown, it is estimated by Humphrey Searle to be from about 1840; the composition is believed to have originated from one of Liszt's early works, performed in 1827.)\nMaurice Ravel uses this chord in his piano work Jeux d'eau to create flourishing, water-like sounds that characterize the piece. In his article \"Ravel's 'Russian' Period: Octatonicism in His Early Works, 1893-1908\", Steven Baur notes that Jeux d'eau was composed in 1901, ten years before Stravinsky composed Petrushka (1911), suggesting that Stravinsky may have learned the trick from Ravel.  Stravinsky heard Jeux d'eau and several other works by Ravel no later than 1907 at the \"Evenings for Contemporary Music\" program.Stravinsky used the chord repeatedly throughout the ballet Petrushka to represent the puppet and devised the chord to represent the puppet's mocking of the crowd at the Shrovetide Fair. Eric Walter White suggests and dismisses the possibility that the Petrushka chord is derived from Messiaen's \"second Modes of limited transposition\" (the octatonic scale) in favor of a \"black key/white key bitonality\" which results from, \"Stravinsky's well known habit of composing at the piano.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, at first Koizumi, Miyamoto and Tezuka thought that the world was too daringly out of character with Mario. There were ten candidates for possible water nozzles, and F.L.U.D.D. was chosen because of fitting in the game's setting, though it was not one of the favorites.

Featuring the voices of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, Mary Gibbs, and Jennifer Tilly, the film was directed by Pete Docter (in his feature directorial debut), co-directed by Lee Unkrich and David Silverman, and produced by Darla K. Anderson, from a screenplay by Andrew Stanton and Daniel Gerson. The film centers on two monsters, the hairy James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan (Goodman) and his one-eyed partner and best friend Mike Wazowski (Crystal), who are employed at the titular energy-producing factory Monsters, Inc., which generates power by scaring human children. However, the monster world believes that the children are toxic, and when a little human girl, Boo (Gibbs), sneaks into the factory, she must be returned home before it is too late.\nDocter began developing the film in 1996, and wrote the story with Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon and Ralph Eggleston, following the idea conceived in a lunch in 1994 attended during the near completion of Toy Story (1995). Stanton wrote the screenplay with Gerson. The characters went through many incarnations over the film's five-year production process. The technical team and animators found new ways to simulate fur and cloth realistically for the film. Randy Newman, who composed the music for Pixar's three prior films, returned to compose the score for its fourth.\nMonsters, Inc. premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on October 28, 2001, and was released in theaters in the United States on November 2. Upon its release, it received critical acclaim and was a commercial success, grossing over $528 million worldwide to become the third highest-grossing film of 2001.

After Muzak switched in the 1990s to programs based on commercial recordings, its inventory grew to include about 500 \"Yesterday\" covers. In his 1972 article on the development of rock music, Joel Vance of Stereo Review magazine credited the song with originating the vogue for classical and baroque rock, anticipating the Rolling Stones' recording of \"As Tears Go By\" and works by artists such as the Moody Blues and the Classics IV.\"Yesterday\" won the Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Song of 1965\", and came second in the \"Most Performed Work of the Year\" category, behind the Lennon\u2013McCartney composition \"Michelle\". More recently, Rolling Stone ranked \"Yesterday\" at number 13 on its 2004 list \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" and fourth on its 2010 list of \"The Beatles' 100 Greatest Songs\". In 1999, Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) placed \"Yesterday\" third on its list of songs of the 20th century most performed on American radio and television, with approximately seven million performances. \"Yesterday\" was surpassed only by the Association's \"Never My Love\" and the Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\". \"Yesterday\" was voted Best Song of the 20th century in a 1999 BBC Radio 2 poll.The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1997. Although it was nominated for Song of the Year at the 1966 Grammy Awards, it lost out to Tony Bennett's \"The Shadow of Your Smile\". \"Yesterday\" was nominated for six Grammys in total that year, and \"Help!\" was also nominated in four categories. After the band had failed to win any of the ten awards, Alan Livingston, the head of Capitol Records, officially protested about the results, saying that \"Yesterday\" being passed over for the Song of the Year \"makes a mockery of the whole event\".\nChuck Berry said that \"Yesterday\" was the song that he wished that he had written. \"Yesterday\" has also been criticised for being mundane and mawkish. Bob Dylan had a marked dislike for the song, stating that \"If you go into the Library of Congress, you can find a lot better than that. There are millions of songs like 'Michelle' and 'Yesterday' written in Tin Pan Alley.\" Accompanied by Harrison, Dylan recorded his own version of \"Yesterday\" four years later,, but it was never released.Shortly before he died in 1980, Lennon commented, \"Although the lyrics don't resolve into any sense, they're good lines. They certainly work ... but if you read the whole song, it doesn't say anything\" and added the song was \"beautiful \u2013 and I never wished I'd written it\". Lennon made reference to \"Yesterday\" in his song \"How Do You Sleep?\" on his 1971 album Imagine. The song appears to attack McCartney with the line \"The only thing you done was yesterday, but since you've gone you're just another day\", a reference to McCartney's recent hit \"Another Day\".\nIn 2001, McCartney said that he had asked Yoko Ono to agree to change the writing credit for \"Yesterday\" from \"Lennon/McCartney\" to \"McCartney/Lennon\". He said that Ono refused, which was one of the reasons for their poor relationship at the time.At the 2006 Grammy Awards, McCartney performed \"Yesterday\" live as a mash-up with Linkin Park and Jay Z's \"Numb/Encore\".\nIn 2012, the BBC reported that \"Yesterday\" remained the fourth-most-successful song of all time in terms of royalties paid, having amassed a total of \u00a319.5 million in payments.", "hasanswer": false}]}

L\u00e9lio is a record of the composer overcoming his despair and \"returning to life\" via the consolations of music and literature. Berlioz later revised his intentions, making it seem as if both the symphony and L\u00e9lio were about Harriet Smithson (she later became his wife). The symphony uses programme music to describe a despairing artist trying to kill himself with an overdose of opium, leading to a series of increasingly terrifying visions. The programme of L\u00e9lio describes the artist wakening from these dreams, musing on William Shakespeare, his sad life, and not having a woman. He decides that if he can't put this unrequited love out of his head, he will immerse himself in music. He then leads an orchestra to a successful performance of one of his new compositions and the story ends peacefully.\nL\u00e9lio consists of six musical pieces presented by an actor who stands on stage in front of a curtain concealing the orchestra, chorus and solo singers. The actor's dramatic monologues explain the meaning of the music in the life of the artist.

Moving around a lot, Dawn's family does not provide much stability for her, but what her lifestyle lacks in stability, her home life makes up for in love.\nThis erratic lifestyle seems to change when Dawn and Jimmy are able to enroll in an exclusive private school when Ormond gets a job there. It is here that Dawn's talent for singing is discovered. Her brother does not enjoy the school, feeling the weight of class differences bear down upon him. Dawn, although optimistic, does not fare much better, and is sternly ordered by the headmistress to be on her best behavior as she is of lesser social status than her classroom peers.\nOn her first day, she also incurs the wrath of the most popular and affluent girl in the school, Clara Sue Cutler, after accidentally ratting her out on her smoking. Clara Sue then proceeds to pull mean-spirited pranks on Dawn and openly refers to her as white trash. Deeply offended, Dawn finally stops trying to like Clara Sue after this insult. However, Clara Sue's older brother, the handsome and charming Philip Cutler, does not share his sister's loathing.\nPhillip is kind to Dawn, and immediately shows an interest in her. He compares her beauty to that of his mother, Laura Sue Cutler, and is easily entranced. Jimmy is wary of Phillip, but does not overtly oppose Dawn's involvement with him. A shy girl who has had a sheltered upbringing, Dawn is somewhat taken aback by Phillip's immediate romantic overtures, even though she does find him attractive. Phillip urges her to date him, and after constant persuasion from him, Dawn agrees. Meanwhile, Dawn's mother, Sally Jean, has discovered that she is pregnant. This strains the Longchamps' finances, which are already tight, but Dawn is still overjoyed at the prospect of a little sibling, hoping that the baby will look more like her. Sally Jean gives birth to a little girl named Fern, but does not recover her health after the labor. She attempts several holistic ways of recovering her health but to no avail. She remains bedridden for the duration of Dawn's school year.\nAt school, Dawn is excited by the musical opportunities now opening up to her. Her enjoyment of music culminates in her solo song, \"Over the Rainbow\", at a school concert. Although nervous because of a prank pulled earlier by Clara Sue and her clique, Dawn draws emotional strength from the pearl necklace Sally Jean gave her earlier in the evening, which she claims are a Longchamp heirloom.\nDawn's world comes crashing down after her solo performance at the school concert. Her beloved mother, Sally Jean, passes away that night. With the shock of this barely registered, what comes on the heels of Sally Jean's death truly changes Dawn's life forever. A security guard at the hospital where Sally Jean died recognizes the family, and also notices something peculiar in Dawn's appearance. He goes to the authorities, who perform an early morning raid of the Longchamp residence. Through these officers, it is revealed to Dawn that she is not Ormond and Sally Jean's biological daughter, but that she was kidnapped by them as a newborn baby, and that she is actually the daughter of Randolph and Laura Sue Cutler.\nDawn is taken back to Cutler's Cove, Virginia, an offshoot of Virginia Beach. Ormond is arrested for child kidnapping. With no nearby relatives to come to their aid, Jimmy and Fern are placed in foster care. Dawn refuses to believe that Ormond kidnapped her, but the authorities prove her identity through a unique birthmark she shares with the description of the kidnapped baby. Dawn is appalled at the realization that the terrible Clara Sue is her sister; even worse, her boyfriend, Phillip, is actually her brother.\nThese concerns fade into the background after her first meeting with Grandmother Cutler at the family's hotel, also named Cutler's Cove. Grandmother Cutler does not seem overjoyed about the return of her long-lost grandchild. She informs Dawn that she will be known by her \"true\" name, Eugenia, and that she will work in the hotel as a maid in order to prove that she is trustworthy. Dawn is shocked and upset by this cold treatment. She tries appealing to her real parents, Randolph and Laura Sue, but they are just as powerless as her. Randolph, though charming and handsome, has little willpower and prefers life to be as smooth as possible. Laura Sue is enchanted by Dawn's prettiness and resemblance to her, but refuses to make any effort to help her, as she is completely cowed by her mother-in-law. Dawn is also put at risk by Clara Sue's malicious tricks.\nInfuriated by Dawn's return, she does her best to make sure Dawn is fired by stealing jewellery and other items from the hotel guests. Dawn finds some comfort in the housekeeper, Mrs. Boston, who knew Sally Jean and Ormond Longchamp when they worked at the hotel. She cannot believe that her parents stole her, as they were always honest, hard-working people. Mrs. Boston hints that there is more to the \"kidnapping\" than meets the eye. Dawn's life is further brightened by a secret visit from Jimmy, aided and abetted by Phillip. Jimmy confesses that he has been in love with Dawn since they were children, but never dared show it because he felt he was sick for thinking of her that way. Dawn admits the attraction is mutual, but they find it hard to overcome their upbringing as brother and sister.\nThis happy interlude comes to an end when Clara Sue finds Jimmy in the basement, where Dawn hid him.  She tells Grandmother Cutler, who goes to the police and has Jimmy taken back to his foster parents. Dawn is heart-broken that Jimmy has to leave and is furious with Clara Sue. Jealous of her obvious affection for Jimmy, Phillip corners Dawn in her bathroom and rapes her. Desperate to get out, Dawn visits Mrs. Dalton, the woman who took care of her just after she was born, and learns that her \"kidnapping\" was staged by Grandmother Cutler because she is not Randolph's biological daughter but a product of one of her mother's extramarital affairs. Grandmother Cutler did not want a non-Cutler child to grow up as part of the family, so she paid the Longchamps with family jewels, including the string of pearls, to keep them quiet and to provide for Dawn's future. Outraged, Dawn confronts Grandmother Cutler about this.\nThe old woman eventually admits that she was behind the \"kidnapping\" and offers Dawn a deal: if Dawn will study singing in New York, Grandmother Cutler will use her influence to have Ormond released from prison. Dawn agrees but on one condition: that she be referred to by Dawn, not Eugenia. The book ends with Dawn going to New York.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His opportunities to set English texts to music were more limited. He spent the years 1717 to 1719 as composer in residence to the wealthy Duke of Chandos, where he wrote church anthems and two stage works, Acis and Galatea and Esther. He composed vocal music to English words for various royal occasions, including a set of Coronation anthems for George II in 1727, which made a huge impact. In 1731, a performance of the 1718 version of Esther, a work in English based on a Biblical drama by Jean Racine, was given in London without Handel's participation and proved to be popular. He thus revised the work and planned to present it at the theatre where his Italian operas were being presented. However, the Bishop of London would not permit a drama based on a Biblical story to be acted out on the stage; Handel therefore presented Esther in concert form, thus giving birth to the English oratorio.:\u200a212\u200aEsther in its revised form proved to be a popular work, and Handel, though still continuing to focus on composing Italian operas, followed up with two more sacred dramas with English words presented in concert form, Deborah, and Athalia (which, like Esther, was also based on a Biblical drama by Racine), both in 1733.\nSuch was the success of his oratorios in English that Handel eventually abandoned Italian opera, with his last being Deidamia in 1741 and a string of masterpieces of oratorio in English.Handel began the composition of Samson immediately after completing Messiah on 14 September 1741. It used a libretto by Newburgh Hamilton, based on Milton's Samson Agonistes, which in turn was based on the figure Samson in Chapter 16 of the Book of Judges. Handel completed the first act on 20 September 1741, the second act on 11 October that year, and the whole work on 29 October. Shortly after that he travelled to Dublin to premiere Messiah, returning to London at the end of August 1742 and thoroughly revising Samson.\nThe premiere was given at Covent Garden in London on 18 February 1743, with the incidental organ music probably played at the recently completed concerto in A major (HWV 307).  The oratorio was a great success, leading to a total of seven performances in its first season, the most in a single season of any of his oratorios.

Clayton commissioned Jeremy Brooks (then literary manager of the Royal Shakespeare Company) to write the script, but he found Brooks' adaptation too long and too close to its source, so he brought in his wife, the noted Israeli-born actress and writer Haya Harareet, who \"tightened the structure and particularly changed the ending to make it more thematically consistent and psychologically consistent than in the novel\".Richard Burton was the first choice to play Charlie, but it was thought that his fee would push the budget too high, so Bogarde was cast in the role.

Bernard suggested a subtitle for each month's piece.  Tchaikovsky accepted the commission and all of Bernard's subtitles, and in the December 1875 edition of the magazine, readers were promised a new Tchaikovsky piece each month throughout 1876.  The January and February pieces were written in late 1875 and sent to Bernard in December, with a request for some feedback as to whether they were suitable, and if not, Tchaikovsky would rewrite February and ensure the remainder were in the style Bernard was after.  March, April and May appear to have been composed separately; however the remaining seven pieces were all composed at the same time and written in the same copybook, and evidence suggests they were written between 22 April and 27 May.  The orchestration of Swan Lake was finished by 22 April, leaving the composer free to focus on other music; and he left for abroad at the end of May.  This seems to put the lie to Nikolay Kashkin's published version of events, which was that each month the composer would sit down to write a single piece, but only after being reminded to do so by his valet.The epigraphs that appeared on publication of the pieces were chosen by Bernard, not by Tchaikovsky.   In 1886 the publisher P. Jurgenson acquired the rights to The Seasons and the piece has been reprinted many times.Tchaikovsky did not devote his most serious compositional efforts to these pieces; they were composed to order, and they were a way of supplementing his income.  He saw the writing of music to a commission as just as valid as writing music from his own inner inspiration; however, for the former he needed a definite plot or text, a time limit, and the promise of payment at the end.

It takes place in a fictional version of the Caribbean during the age of piracy. The player assumes the role of Guybrush Threepwood, a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate, and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles.\nThe game was conceived in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the player character's death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.\nCritics praised The Secret of Monkey Island for its humor, audiovisuals, and gameplay. Several publications list it among the greatest video games of all time. The game spawned a number of sequels, collectively known as the Monkey Island series. Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman also led the development of the sequel Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. LucasArts released a remake of the original in 2009, which was also well received by the gaming press.", "hasanswer": true}]}

David Hackl, who served as production designer for the two previous Saw films, was offered to direct the film, but the day he received the offer his wife was diagnosed with cancer. Producers offered him directorial duties for Saw V and Saw VI.As Whannell was uninterested in writing any more Saw films, Twisted Pictures sought new writers and ideas for the fourth Saw film, making it the first film to not be written by him. An executive discovered Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton and read their script The Midnight Man. The executive thought that the duo's script could serve as a prequel to the first film, detailing a traumatic event in Jigsaw/John's early life. However, producers Mark Burg and Oren Koules did not want to do a prequel and dropped the idea, but the script led Dunstan and Melton to be hired to write the next three Saw films. Thomas Fenton also joined Dunstan and Melton as writer to the film.  Marek Posival was attached to write at one point.Stepping into the franchise was tricky for Dunstan and Melton, given the serialized nature of the Saw films. However, they counted on Bousman and the crew to watch over them, pitching a trilogy that would start with Saw IV and conclude in Saw VI. The duo did not have any trouble in bringing Jigsaw back into the story despite his death in the last film, as the character had been dying since the original film, feeling that the film would not feel like a Saw entry without the character.  Like in previous entries, rewrites took place during the writing process, leading many unused ideas for the film to later be recycled for Saw V.Even though Tobin Bell's Jigsaw Killer character was killed off in the previous entry, in March 2007 it was announced that he signed on for Saw IV and Saw V.With a production budget of $10 million production budget, principal photography took place from April 16, 2007 to May 3, 2007 in Toronto.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Bernard suggested a subtitle for each month's piece.  Tchaikovsky accepted the commission and all of Bernard's subtitles, and in the December 1875 edition of the magazine, readers were promised a new Tchaikovsky piece each month throughout 1876.  The January and February pieces were written in late 1875 and sent to Bernard in December, with a request for some feedback as to whether they were suitable, and if not, Tchaikovsky would rewrite February and ensure the remainder were in the style Bernard was after.  March, April and May appear to have been composed separately; however the remaining seven pieces were all composed at the same time and written in the same copybook, and evidence suggests they were written between 22 April and 27 May.  The orchestration of Swan Lake was finished by 22 April, leaving the composer free to focus on other music; and he left for abroad at the end of May.  This seems to put the lie to Nikolay Kashkin's published version of events, which was that each month the composer would sit down to write a single piece, but only after being reminded to do so by his valet.The epigraphs that appeared on publication of the pieces were chosen by Bernard, not by Tchaikovsky.   In 1886 the publisher P. Jurgenson acquired the rights to The Seasons and the piece has been reprinted many times.Tchaikovsky did not devote his most serious compositional efforts to these pieces; they were composed to order, and they were a way of supplementing his income.  He saw the writing of music to a commission as just as valid as writing music from his own inner inspiration; however, for the former he needed a definite plot or text, a time limit, and the promise of payment at the end.

The result of this setting is: if the player plays simple quarter notes, the added echoes will produce a pattern of quarter note \u2013 eighth note, quarter note \u2013 eighth note. Pink Floyd would again use this technique on the bass line for \"Sheep\". This riff was first created by David Gilmour on guitar with effects, then Roger Waters had the idea of using bass instead of guitar, so they recorded the song on two different bass guitars.\nThe piece is in B minor, occasionally alternating with an A major chord.\nThe distinctive keyboard accents on this track are composed of three components: A Hammond organ forms the 'fade in', followed by a \"Stab\" composed of a second Hammond organ with percussion stop, overdubbed with an acoustic piano fed through a Leslie speaker, as was also used on \"Echoes\". For live versions, the 'fade in' part was played on a Farfisa organ.The threatening lyric, a rare vocal contribution by Nick Mason, was recorded through a ring modulator and slowed down to create an eerie effect. It was aimed at Sir Jimmy Young, the then BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 DJ who the band supposedly disliked because of his tendency to babble. During early 1970s concerts, they sometimes played a sound collage of clips from Young's radio show that was edited to sound completely nonsensical, thus figuratively \"cutting him into little pieces\". The bootleg compilation A Treeful of Secrets contains a demo version of \"One of These Days\" in which the Jimmy Young collage loops in the background during the performance. However, the authenticity of this demo has not been confirmed.\nPossibly the most interesting thing about \"One of These Days\" is that it actually stars myself as vocalist, for the first time on any of our records that actually got to the public. It's a rather startling performance involving the use of a high voice and slowed down tape. \nAccording to John Peel, Waters described \"One of These Days\" as a \"poignant appraisal of the contemporary social situation\". Gilmour said it was the most collaborative piece ever produced by the group.A film, French Windows, was made by Ian Emes, set to the piece and featuring people and gibbons dancing against various backgrounds. After being seen on television by the band, it was back-projected by Pink Floyd during live performances and Emes was commissioned to make further films for the band.\nThe tune also quotes Delia Derbyshire's realisation of Ron Grainer's Doctor Who theme music from the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. This quotation is most clear in live performances, particularly in concerts on the Momentary Lapse of Reason and Division Bell tours.Part of the song was used on the Soviet television program \"Mezhdunarodnaya Panorama\" (\"International Panorama\").

It is the eighth movie of the Star Trek franchise, and the second starring the cast of the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the film, the crew of the starship USS Enterprise-E travel back in time from the 24th century to the 21st century to stop the cybernetic Borg from conquering Earth by changing the past.\nAfter the release of Star Trek Generations in 1994, Paramount Pictures tasked writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore with developing the next film in the series. Braga and Moore wanted to feature the Borg in the plot, while producer Rick Berman wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film in Renaissance Italy, but changed the time period that the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century, after fearing the Renaissance idea would feel kitschy. After two better-known directors turned down the job, cast member Jonathan Frakes was chosen to direct to make sure the task fell to someone who understood Star Trek.\nThe film's script required the creation of new starship designs, including a new USS Enterprise. Production designer Herman Zimmerman and illustrator John Eaves collaborated to make a sleeker ship than its predecessor. Principal photography began with weeks of location shooting in Arizona and California, before production moved to new sets for the ship-based scenes. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as their appearances on the television series. Effects company Industrial Light & Magic rushed to complete the film's special effects in less than five months. Traditional optical effects techniques were supplemented with computer-generated imagery. Jerry Goldsmith composed the film\u2019s score.\nStar Trek: First Contact was released on November 22, 1996, and was the highest-grossing film on its opening weekend. It grossed a worldwide total of $146 million. Critical reception was mostly positive; critics including Roger Ebert considered it to be one of the best Star Trek films. The Borg and the special effects were lauded, while characterization was less evenly received.

{"id": "639_921", "question": "Who was the composer of Hair?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_10648", "text": "Hair was conceived by actors James Rado and Gerome Ragni.  The two met in 1964 when they performed together in the Off-Broadway flop Hang Down Your Head and Die, and they began writing Hair together in late 1964.  The main characters were autobiographical, with Rado's Claude being a pensive romantic and Ragni's Berger an extrovert.  Their close relationship, including its volatility, was reflected in the musical.  Rado explained, \"We were great friends.  It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity, into writing, into creating this piece.  We put the drama between us on stage.\"Rado described the inspiration for Hair as \"a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long\".  He recalled, \"There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful. ... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [and] let our hair grow.\"  Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. Rado said, \"It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples.  You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. We thought, 'This is happening in the streets', and we wanted to bring it to the stage.\" According to Rado's obituary in The New York Times, the title was inspired by \"a museum stroll in mid-1965, [when he and Ragni saw] a painting of a tuft of hair by the Pop artist Jim Dine. Its title was 'Hair'.\"Rado and Ragni came from different artistic backgrounds. In college, Rado wrote musical revues and aspired to be a Broadway composer in the Rodgers and Hammerstein tradition.  He went on to study acting with Lee Strasberg.  Ragni, on the other hand, was an active member of The Open Theater, one of several groups, mostly Off-off Broadway, that were developing experimental theatre techniques.  He introduced Rado to the modern theatre styles and methods being developed at The Open Theater.  In 1966, while the two were developing Hair, Ragni performed in The Open Theater's production of Megan Terry's play Viet Rock, a story about young men being deployed to the Vietnam War. In addition to the war theme, Viet Rock employed the improvisational exercises being used in the experimental theatre scene and later used in the development of Hair.Rado and Ragni brought their drafts of the show to producer Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition \"African Waltz\" (recorded by Cannonball Adderley).  The composer's lifestyle was in marked contrast to his co-creators: \"I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and I lived on Staten Island.\"  \"I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni.\"  But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show.  \"We work independently\", explained MacDermot in May 1968.  \"I prefer it that way.  They hand me the material.  I set it to music.\"  MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with the songs \"I Got Life\", \"Ain't Got No\", \"Where Do I Go\" and the title song.  He first wrote \"Aquarius\" as an unconventional art piece, but later rewrote it into an uplifting anthem.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He composed it in Weimar for the Sunday Sexagesimae, the second Sunday before Lent, likely by 1713.\nThe cantata is based on a text by Erdmann Neumeister published in 1711. While at Weimar Bach set at least one other cantata text by this librettist; he also set others by the court poet Salomon Franck. The text cites Isaiah, related to the gospel, the parable of the Sower. The third movement is in the style of a sermon, combined with a litany by Martin Luther. The closing chorale is the eighth stanza of Lazarus Spengler's hymn \"Durch Adams Fall ist ganz verderbt\".\nThe cantata falls relatively early in Bach's chronology of cantata compositions. It was possibly composed for performance on 24 February 1715, but more likely for a year or even two earlier. Sexagesima always falls within January or February, so the title's reference to snowfall would have been relevant to the weather at the time.\nBach structured the work in five movements, a sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and a closing chorale. He scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir only in the chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble which is unusual in having violas but no violins.  The instruments originally specified were four violas, cello, bassoon and basso continuo. When he performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, he added two recorders to double viola I and II an octave higher, thus creating a lighter sound overall.", "hasanswer": true}]}
