In 2006, Inter sold its brand to the new subsidiary, \"Inter Brand S.r.l.\", a special purpose entity with a shares capital of \u20ac40 million, for \u20ac158 million (the deal made Internazionale make a net loss of just \u20ac31 million in a separate financial statement). At the same time, the subsidiary secured a \u20ac120 million loan from Banca Antonveneta, which would be repaid in installments until 30 June 2016; La Repubblica described the deal as \"doping\". In September 2011, Inter secured a loan from ICS by factoring the sponsorship of Pirelli of 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314 season, for \u20ac24.8 million, in an interest rate of 3 months Euribor + 1.95% spread.

In the 2009\u201310 season, Inter remained in ninth place, surpassing Juventus (10th) but Milan re-took the leading role as the seventh. Inter became the eighth in 2010\u20132011, but was still one place behind Milan. Since 2011, Inter fell to 11th in 2011\u201312, 15th in 2012\u201313, 17th in 2013\u201314, 19th in 2014\u201315 and 2015\u201316 season. In 2016\u201317 season, Inter was ranked 15th in the Money League.In 2010 Football Money League (2008\u201309 season), the normalized revenue of \u20ac196.5 million were divided up between matchday (14%, \u20ac28.2 million), broadcasting (59%, \u20ac115.7 million, +7%, +\u20ac8 million) and commercial (27%, \u20ac52.6 million, +43%). Kit sponsors Nike and Pirelli contributed \u20ac18.1 million and \u20ac9.3 million respectively to commercial revenues, while broadcasting revenues were boosted \u20ac1.6 million (6%) by Champions League distribution. Deloitte expressed the idea that issues in Italian football, particularly matchday revenue issues, were holding Inter back compared to other European giants, and developing their own stadia would result in Serie A clubs being more competitive on the world stage.In the 2009\u201310 season, the revenue of Inter was boosted by the sales of Ibrahimovi\u0107, the treble and the release clause of coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. According to the normalized figures by Deloitte in their 2011 Football Money League, in the 2009\u201310 season, the revenue had increased \u20ac28.3 million (14%) to \u20ac224.8 million. The ratio of matchday, broadcasting and commercial in the adjusted figures was 17%:62%:21%.For the 2010\u201311 season, Serie A clubs started negotiating club TV rights collectively rather than individually. This was predicted to result in lower broadcasting revenues for big clubs such as Juventus and Inter, with smaller clubs gaining from the loss. Eventually the result included an extraordinary income of \u20ac13 million from RAI. In 2012 Football Money League (2010\u201311 season), the normalized revenue was \u20ac211.4 million. The ratio of matchday, broadcasting and commercial in the adjusted figures was 16%:58%:26%.However, combining revenue and cost, in the 2006\u201307 season they had a net loss of \u20ac206 million (\u20ac112 million extraordinary basis, due to the abolition of non-standard accounting practice of the special amortization fund), followed by a net loss of \u20ac148 million in the 2007\u201308 season, a net loss of \u20ac154 million in 2008\u201309 season, a net loss of \u20ac69 million in the 2009\u201310 season, a net loss of \u20ac87 million in the 2010\u201311 season, a net loss of \u20ac77 million in the 2011\u201312 season, a net loss of \u20ac80 million in the 2012\u201313 season and a net profit of \u20ac33 million in 2013\u201314 season, due to special income from the establishment of subsidiary Inter Media and Communication. All aforementioned figures were in separate financial statement. Figures from consolidated financial statement were announced since the 2014\u201315 season, which were net losses of \u20ac140.4 million (2014\u201315), \u20ac59.6 million (2015\u201316 season, before 2017 restatement) and \u20ac24.6 million (2016\u201317).In 2015, Inter and Roma were the only two Italian clubs that were sanctioned by the UEFA due to their breaking of UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations, which was followed by AC Milan which was once barred from returning to European competition in 2018. As a probation to avoid further sanction, Inter agreed to have a three-year aggregate break-even from 2015 to 2018, with the 2015\u201316 season being allowed to have a net loss of a maximum of \u20ac30 million, followed by break-even in the 2016\u201317 season and onwards. Inter was also fined \u20ac6 million plus an additional \u20ac14 million in probation.Inter also made a financial trick in the transfer market in mid-2015, in which Stevan Joveti\u0107 and Miranda were signed by Inter on temporary deals plus an obligation to sign outright in 2017, making their cost less in the loan period. Moreover, despite heavily investing in new signings, namely Geoffrey Kondogbia and Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107, signings which potentially increased the cost in amortization, Inter also sold Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 for \u20ac29 million, making a windfall profit. In November 2018, documents from Football Leaks further revealed that the loan signings such as Xherdan Shaqiri in January 2015, was in fact had inevitable conditions to trigger the outright purchase.On 21 April 2017, Inter announced that their net loss (FFP adjusted) of the 2015\u201316 season was within the allowable limit of \u20ac30 million. However, on the same day, UEFA also announced that the reduction of squad size of Inter in European competitions would not be lifted yet, due to partial fulfilment of the targets in the settlement agreement. Same announcement was made by UEFA in June 2018, based on Inter's 2016\u201317 season financial result.In February 2020, Inter Milan sued Major League Soccer (MLS) for trademark infringement, claiming that the term \"Inter\" is synonymous with its club and no one else.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Wolfe, the first of many Locus reviewers to discuss the book at time of publication, compares the novel at many points with Willis's Lincoln's Dreams and writes:\n\nApart from its simple virtues as a compelling story on an irresistible theme, Connie Willis's big, ambitious new novel Passage should be of particular interest to her readers because of the ways in which it recapitulates major preoccupations and techniques of her career to date, and because in it she seems fiercely determined to show us everything she's got... Each makes historical research a major vector of narrative suspense, with specific historical details\u2014the Civil War in Lincoln's Dreams, the sinking of the Titanic here\u2014treated as though they were clues in a murder mystery.\nWolfe continues: Like Doomsday Book (1992), it grapples with one of the grandest of all themes, death, and uses the inability of major characters to communicate key bits of information to each other as another suspense device. Like Willis's comic short fiction, it pokes fun at institutional culture\u2014in this case hospitals, with their mazelike architecture and ego-driven politics\u2014and at such ghoulish aspects of pop culture as afterlife gurus like John Edwards\" (i.e., John Edward) \"and self-help manuals for the recently bereaved.\"\nFaren Miller wrote in Locus: \n\nWhile the subject matter and setting of Passage allow Willis to display her characteristically unsentimental poignancy ... she can also poke fun at matters of life and death... The book's multiplying internal and external mazes provide an emblem of human complexity, foolishness, and deeper terrors, some reaching from beyond death. Jonathan Strahan of Locus praises the novel's \"seriousness\", \"clear-eyed humor\" and its \"amusing portrayal of what it's like to be in a big hospital\", which is itself a \"confusing, overwhelming portrait,\" as parts of what it makes \"her most ambitious novel\". He adds, \"At the three-quarter point of Passage, Willis does something that no reviewer should leak but it is much of what makes the book worth reading. What she attempts is to find a way to look at death and life after death in a way that doesn't conflict with matters of faith, but which also is consistent with the fundamentally rational underpinnings of science fiction.\"SciFi.com describes Passage as \"an emotionally exhausting trip\" that is ultimately \"a rewarding experience.\" Laura Miller, writing for Salon, says that \"its construction is a marvel of ingenuity and \u2014 what's even more remarkable, given the wizardry of Willis' storytelling \u2014 its intellectual honesty is impeccable... You won't find the beautiful sentences of more-celebrated 'novelists of ideas' here, though the ideas themselves are far better, more daring and more original, than those chewed over by most literary heavyweights. The dialogue can sound a trifle canned, the minor characters feel a mite thin (not that many novels of ideas don't share these flaws, too), which explains in part why Passage seems to hover between genre and genius. Given how rare a searching intelligence like Willis' is among today's novelists, does it really matter?\"The SF Site review judges that the novel \"starts slowly, and it's too long. Willis' trademark habit of making some set of frustrating everyday-life details a recurring motif or running joke (in this case, the difficulty of navigating the hospital corridors, plus the never-open cafeteria) is over-extended here...\"; conversely, reviewer Steven Wu felt that \"Part One of the book is masterful, with several chilling scenes, a compelling mystery, and a doozy of a cliffhanger ending. But then, only a third of the way through the book, things begin slowing down.\"\nThe A.V. Club's reviewer writes: There's certainly nothing comforting about Passage, which steeps its characters in death of all kinds \u2014 swift and sudden, prolonged and painful. Willis' satirical flair originally has Landry [sic] and Wright running around like The Three Stooges, juggling impossible schedules in an impossible environment and careening amidst exaggeratedly colorful characters in every chapter. A mid-book twist, however, takes the story into darker and more memorable territory, helping turn Passage into a complex, finely crafted, haunting story that makes the light at the end of the tunnel impossible to take lightly.\nA reviewer from Scientific Gems wrote of the novel, \"it is well-written, it has an interesting plot, and it has useful things to say about the nature of science and the nature of medicine. One piece of good advice, for example: 'Joanna says you should only say what you saw, not what anybody else says you should see.'\" [Spoken by Maisie Nellis] \"Indeed, the importance of truth is underscored repeatedly in the book.

{"id": "560_26", "question": "What sport does Birmingham City F.C. play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "560_4530", "text": "Small Heath Alliance played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, Bordesley Green. As interest grew, they moved to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, where admission could be charged. A year later, they moved again, to a field adjoining Muntz Street, Small Heath, near the main Coventry Road, with a capacity of about 10,000. The Muntz Street ground was adequate for 1880s friendly matches, and the capacity was gradually raised to around 30,000, but when several thousand spectators scaled walls and broke down turnstiles to get into a First Division match against Aston Villa, it became clear that it could no longer cope with the demand.Director Harry Morris identified a site for a new ground in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile (1 km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies are known to have camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.\n\nThe original capacity of St Andrew's was reported as 75,000, with 4,000 seats in the Main Stand and space for 22,000 under cover. By 1938 the official capacity was 68,000, and February 1939 saw the attendance record set at the fifth round FA Cup tie against Everton, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341. On the outbreak of the Second World War, the Chief Constable ordered the ground's closure because of the danger from air raids; it was the only ground to be thus closed, and was only re-opened after the matter was raised in Parliament. It was badly damaged during the Birmingham Blitz: the Railway End and the Kop as a result of bombing, while the Main Stand burnt down when a fireman mistook petrol for water.\nThe replacement Main Stand used a propped cantilever roof design, which meant fewer pillars to block spectators' view of the pitch. Floodlights were installed in 1956, and officially switched on for a friendly match against Borussia Dortmund in 1957. By the early 1960s a stand had been built at the Railway End to the same design as the Main Stand, roofs had been put on the Kop and Tilton Road End, and the ground capacity was down to about 55,000.Resulting from the 1986 Popplewell Report into the safety of sports grounds and the later Taylor Report, the capacity of St Andrew's was set at 28,235 for safety reasons, but it was accepted that the stadium had to be brought up to modern all-seated standards. After the last home game of the 1993\u201394 season, the Kop and Tilton Road terraces were demolished \u2013 fans took home a significant proportion as souvenirs \u2013 to be replaced at the start of the new season by a 7,000-seat Tilton Road Stand, continuing round the corner into the 9,500-seat Kop which opened two months later. The 8,000-seat Railway Stand followed in 1999; ten years later, this was renamed the Gil Merrick Stand, in honour of the club's appearance record-holder and former manager, but the Main Stand has still to be modernised. In 2021, the club website listed the stadium capacity as 29,409.In 2004 a proposal was put forward to build a \"sports village\" comprising a 55,000-capacity City of Birmingham Stadium, other sports and leisure facilities, and a super casino, to be jointly financed by Birmingham City Council, Birmingham City F.C. (via the proceeds of the sale of St Andrew's) and the casino group Las Vegas Sands. The feasibility of the plan depended on the government issuing a licence for a super casino, and Birmingham being chosen as the venue, but this did not happen. The club have planning permission to redevelop the Main Stand, but club and council continued to seek alternative sources of funding for the City of Birmingham Stadium project.In 2013, the Birmingham City Supporters' Trust's application for listing St Andrew's as an Asset of Community Value (ACV) \u2013 a building or other land whose main use \"furthers the social wellbeing or social interests of the local community\" and where it is realistic to believe it could do so in the future. \u2013 under the Localism Act 2011 was approved by Birmingham City Council. This requires any proposed sale to be notified to the council, and provides for a six-month moratorium on that sale to allow the Trust and other community groups to submit their own bid. In 2018, the club's owners agreed a three-year sponsorship deal under which the name became St Andrew's Trillion Trophy Stadium.The lower tiers of the Tilton and Kop stands were closed for asbestos-related repairs for approaching three years, reopening fully in November 2023. In 2024, the stadium was renamed St. Andrew's @ Knighthead Park for sponsorship reasons, as \"step one in [the owners'] plan to create a world-renowned 'Sports Quarter' in Birmingham.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "560_4532", "text": "Small Heath F.C. became a limited company in 1888; its first share issue was to the value of \u00a3650. The board was made up of local businessmen and dignitaries until 1965, when the club was sold to Clifford Coombs. By the mid-1980s the club was in financial trouble. Control passed from the Coombs family to former Walsall F.C. chairman Ken Wheldon, who cut costs, made redundancies, and sold off assets, including the club's training ground. Still unable to make the club pay, Wheldon sold it to the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain. Debt was still increasing when matters came to a head; the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) put the Kumars' businesses into receivership. The club continued in administration for four months until Sport Newspapers' proprietor David Sullivan bought the Kumars' 84% holding for \u00a3700,000 from BCCI's liquidator in March 1993. Birmingham City plc, of which the football club was a wholly owned subsidiary, was floated on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in 1997 with an issue of 15 million new shares, raising \u00a37.5 million of new investment. It made a pre-tax profit of \u00a34.3M in the year ending 31 August 2008.In July 2007, Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung, via the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK)-listed company Grandtop International Holdings Limited (GIH), bought 29.9% of the plc from its directors. Although his intention to take full control of the club initially came to nothing, GIH completed the purchase in October 2009 at a total cost of \u00a381.5M, re-registered the club as a private company, and renamed the holding company Birmingham International Holdings (BIH).Trading in BIH shares was suspended in June 2011 after Yeung's arrest on charges of money-laundering. Publication of financial results was repeatedly delayed, which led the Football League to impose a transfer embargo, and offers for the club were entertained from 2012 onwards. After Yeung resigned his positions with both club and company in early 2014, share trading resumed, and following his conviction, efforts intensified to dispose of the club, which had to be done piecemeal in order to retain BIH's share listing.Going into 2015, the Football League made public their concerns over Yeung's attempts to impose his choice of directors on the BIHL board despite his conviction disqualifying him from exerting influence over a club. Relationships became increasingly factional, as illustrated by the failure of three directors, including the club's de facto chief executive Panos Pavlakis, to gain re-election, followed the next day by their reinstatement. On 17 February, the board voluntarily appointed receivers from accountants Ernst & Young to take over management of the company. Their statement stressed that no winding-up petition had been issued and the company was not in liquidation.In June 2015, the receivers struck deals with the previous major shareholders such that legal action against them would be dropped in return for their agreement not to obstruct any transfer of ownership to their preferred bidder, the British Virgin Islands-registered investment vehicle Trillion Trophy Asia (TTA), wholly owned by Chinese businessman Paul Suen Cho Hung, who in turn agreed that the company would not be sold on within two years. The process completed in October 2016, leaving TTA owning 50.64% of BIH's share capital, a level of ownership that required them to make an offer for the remainder.To keep the company running, TTA arranged loans which it settled with discounted shares to the same value; the process of creating such shares diluted the percentage holding of all shareholders. Attempts to diversify the company's holdings to make it less reliant on the football club were similarly funded. To reduce the club's losses in light of breaches of the EFL's Profitability and Sustainability Regulations, the stadium was sold for \u00a322.8 million to Birmingham City Stadium Ltd, a new company wholly owned by the football club's parent, and would be leased back to the club, In December 2020, 21.64% of the club and 25% of Birmingham City Stadium were sold to Vong Pech's Oriental Rainbow, and in April 2021, the remaining 75% of the stadium was sold.A June 2022 attempt to purchase the club by a group fronted by former Watford F.C. owner Laurence Bassini, involving financier Keith Harris and with money loaned by David Sullivan, came to nothing. A consortium led by fashion industry businessman Paul Richardson and Argentine former footballer Maxi L\u00f3pez announced in July that they were close to completing the purchase of a stake in the club, and later confirmed that they were providing operating funds, but pulled out in December citing a failure to agree revisions to the original terms of agreement; in April 2023, Richardson, L\u00f3pez and their proposed chief executive, former Charlton Athletic chairman Matt Southall, were sanctioned by the EFL after admitting breaching regulations by taking effective control of the club without approval.In April 2023, Birmingham Sports Holdings confirmed letters of intent had been signed to sell 24% of Birmingham City plc shares held by themselves and the 21.64% owned by Oriental Rainbow, as well as the whole of Birmingham City Stadium Ltd, to a then unnamed potential purchaser, definitive agreements to be reached within a two-month exclusivity period. The purchaser was named as Shelby Companies Ltd, a subsidiary of asset management company Knighthead Capital Management fronted by Tom Wagner, Knighthead's co-founder and co-CEO. The agreements were subject to approval by the English Football League (EFL), which was forthcoming in early June, and by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE), and an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on 13 July voted overwhelmingly to accept. Although BSH retain 51% of the shares, Wagner confirmed that Shelby were \"responsible for the operations of the club moving forward\" and that \"nothing about the way the transaction is structured will prevent us from obtaining the long-term goals we have for the club.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "560_4528", "text": "Birmingham City Football Club is a professional football club based in Birmingham, England.

Bill Carlton wrote in The New York Times that with Drama, Yes \"didn't take any chances alienating the faithful\" fans with a new wave or punk direction and \"news more like Yes than Yes\". Carlton wrote the album is \"full of their tried-and-true brew of orchestral, dramatic, art-rock extrapolations\" and is just as \"daring and fanciful\" as their previous albums. Carlton picked \"Tempus Fugit\" as his favourite. In the Los Angeles Times, John Mendelssohn wrote that Drama is \"infinitely more accessible\" than earlier Yes albums, \"still highly demanding listening\". In the same publication reviewer Steve Pond compared Dean's \"kitschy, dramatic land-and-seascape\" artwork on the album's sleeve to the music on it.\nPond considered Drama the most traditional Yes album in several years, proving to \"anxious fans\" about the line-up change that the new group can sound \"just like the old model\". He described Horn's vocals as at times \"uncanny\" to Anderson's. A review in The Philadelphia Inquirer gave Drama three stars out of four. With the new line-up, \"the results are quite pleasing\" with the band displaying greater vitality and strength than their more recent albums, with \"generally superb\" material. The review picked \"Machine Messiah\", \"Does It Really Happen?\" and \"Tempus Fugit\" as highlight tracks. George Kanzler in Tallahassee Democrat wrote that Yes still retained their \"patented group sound\" despite Anderson and Wakeman's departure, with high tenor vocals, \"rhapsodic\" solos, and \"brisk\" tempo changes. He picked out Howe's guitar work as the band's \"invaluable asset\" but said the lyrics \"are pretentious as always\" which focuses mostly on a mixture of light and dark imagery. Rolling Stone picked out \"Machine Messiah\", \"Tempus Fugit\", and \"Into the Lens\" as stand out tracks. It noted the addition of Horn and Downes in the band \"has not substantially altered the Yes sound, image or presentation. The high vocals, symphonic arrangements, and quasi-mystical lyrics are still there\". It pointed out the \"fresh new spirit\" of the group's playing, though commented that the Buggles' hit single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" is more memorable than the album itself.Joe Konz, in The Indianapolis Star, wrote Downes is an \"adequate\" replacement for Wakeman but pointed out that Horn's voice does not work as well in certain sections, such as \"Into the Lens\". He picked out that track with \"Machine Messiah\" and \"Tempus Fugit\" as highlights, the latter containing what Yes \"does best\" with harmony singing, playing their instruments \"rampantly\", and making \"vigorous rock and roll\". On \"Machine Messiah\", the band \"assembles every kind of artillery that it can unload\" with its heavy metal opening and duel between guitar and vocoder which Konz compared to \"Dueling Banjos\" from the film Deliverance. He concluded with Drama being Yes's best in years. In a review written in the Fort Lauderdale News, Cameron Cohick thought Drama \"sounds exactly like Yes has always sounded. Frighteningly so\". The opening to \"Machine Messiah\" is compared to Black Sabbath fashion with its \"ponderous, droning riff\" and keyboard lines from Downes that he compared to Wakeman. He compared the overall mood of Drama to Fragile and Close to the Edge (1972) with \"relatively simple\" song structures, most with at least one good riff. Though he considered the lyrics are \"the usual quasi-cosmic tripe\", Cohick picked \"Run Through the Light\" as the album's best track which he compared to \"The Battle of Evermore\" by Led Zeppelin.Music critic Rick Johnson thought the group came up with a consistent album, summarising it as \"fairly solid stuff\". In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Paul Collins rates the album three stars out of five, writing: \"It rocks harder than other Yes albums\" and a \"harbinger of Yes and Asia albums to come\" throughout the 1980s. He points out Squire's \"emboldened\" and \"aggressive\" bass playing with White's drums, and Howe's \"more metallic\" approach. Collins picks out \"Machine Messiah\" and \"Tempus Fugit\" as the album's best tracks within an album of promising material.Former (and later) Yes singer Jon Anderson felt the album was \"not my idea of Yes\" and did not represent what the band \"truly is\", but was open to rehearsing songs from the record during his later tenures in the group, though his suggestions were declined.In 2014, Prog readers voted Drama the 100th best progressive rock album.Seven years later, in his memoirs, Howe recalled that \"Drama stands out in my estimation as a true classic Yes album. It speaks oceans about Yes music and the melodic adventures that we loved, a kind of accumulation of the previous decade, I'd say.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

During the dead-ball era of the 1900s and 1910s, an ERA below 2.00 (two earned runs allowed per nine innings) was considered good. In the late 1920s and through the 1930s, when conditions of the game changed in a way that strongly favored hitters, a good ERA was below 4.00; only the highest caliber pitchers, for example Dazzy Vance or Lefty Grove, would consistently post an ERA under 3.00 during these years.

Starting with the 2019 season, an ERA under 4.00 is again considered good.\nThe single-season record for the lowest ERA is held by Dutch Leonard, who in 1914 had an earned run average of 0.96, pitching 224.2 innings with a win\u2013loss record of 19\u20135.  The all-time record for the lowest single season earned run average by a pitcher pitching 300 or more innings is 1.12, set by Bob Gibson in 1968.

For example, this is the premise of Nate Silver's forecasts of ERAs using his PECOTA system. Silver also developed a \"quick\" earned run average (QuikERA or QERA) to calculate an ERA from peripheral statistics including strikeouts, walks, and groundball percentage. Unlike peripheral ERA or PERA, it does not take into account park effects. Another statistic derived from ERA is Adjusted ERA, also called ERA+, which adjusts a pitcher's ERA to a scale where 100 is average for the league and takes into account the various dimensions and other factors of each ballpark.\nIn baseball statistics, runs per nine innings  (denoted by R/9 or RA9) is a measure of a pitcher's effectiveness in preventing runs; calculated as: (9 \u00d7 runs allowed) / (innings pitched).

During their first season, they defeated Cliftonville 3\u20131 on penalties at Solitude in the fifth round of the 2010\u201311 Irish Cup \u2013 at the time, the biggest result in the club's history. It went on to become a very successful season for the club, as they adapted to the step-up to Championship 2 emphatically, winning the division by nine points and losing only one of the 30 games in the process. This secured their second consecutive promotion, elevating them to Championship 1, the second tier of Northern Irish football.\nIn their first season in Championship 1 they found the next step up more difficult to adapt to but still avoided relegation, finishing in 12th place \u2013 nine points clear of the relegation zone. At the start of the 2012\u201313 season the demise of Newry City allowed the club to inherit some of Newry's players \u2013 strengthening their squad substantially. They eventually finished as runners-up, and qualified for the promotion play-off against Donegal Celtic, who had finished second-bottom in the Premiership. Warrenpoint won the tie on the away goals rule after it ended 2\u20132 on aggregate, to reach the top flight for the first time in the club's history. This rounded off a very successful few years for the club, going from the Mid Ulster Football League Intermediate A division to the Premiership in only four seasons.\nIn their first season in the top flight, when many had expected the club to go straight back down, the club played their home fixtures at Dungannon Swifts' ground, Stangmore Park, until 30 November 2013 because their home ground did not meet Premiership criteria.

Following the sale of star striker Daniel Hughes to Cliftonville, the club received Martin Murray and Johnny McMurray from Cliftonville as part of the deal to take Hughes to Solitude. The club had a dramatic upturn in fortunes, first reaching a league cup semi final, before losing 1\u20130 to Cliftonville after extra-time, and in one of the biggest shocks in Irish league history, the Point beat Glentoran 4\u20130 at The Oval. The Point were relegated on the final day of the season. While leading 1\u20130 against Dungannon Swifts and needing a win to stay up, Warrenpoint defender Jordan Dane collided with Andrew Mitchell, and despite Dane falling over, referee Ross Dunlop awarded Dungannon a penalty, much to the disbelief of the home support and players.

The Soronprfbs\u2019 drummer Nana, synthesizer and theremin player Clara, and guitarist Baraque are reluctant to accept Jon, but he is warmly welcomed by lead vocalist Frank, who always wears a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask over his head. Their performance abruptly ends when Clara storms off the stage after being shocked by an electrical fault.\nFrank invites Jon to be part of a Soronprfbs project. He agrees and accompanies them to a remote cabin in Ireland, believing it would take a few days, only to realize they are set to stay there for a whole year while they work their debut album. One day, Don confesses to Jon that he feels he cannot live up to Frank's prowess. The next day, Don reveals they are being evicted from the cabin, but Jon offers to pay the outstanding rent using his grandfather's inheritance. After completing the album, the band finds what appears to be Frank's corpse hanging from a tree, but discover it is actually Don once they remove the mask. They cremate him, and Clara reveals to Jon that Don was the band's original keyboardist.\nJon reveals that he has been secretly uploading the band's recording sessions on social media, earning them a small fan following and an invitation to perform at South by Southwest. Most of the band is offended by Jon's clandestine promotion of them, but Frank, excited by the prospect of a large audience, agrees to go to the festival. Clara confronts Jon as the latter is soaking in the hot tub, expressing contempt for his growing influence over Frank. The ensuing argument culminates in them having angry sex, and Clara threatens to stab him if the trip to America goes awry.\nLeading up to the performance, the band begins to argue over creative differences. Clara and Frank disappear shortly before the concert and Jon finds them in an alley, where Clara is helping Frank stave off a mental breakdown. Jon tries to get Frank to go back to the festival with him, prompting Clara to stab him in the leg as promised. After she is arrested, Jon uses the scandal to build publicity for the band. The night before the concert, Nana and Baraque quit the band. Jon and Frank go onstage by themselves in spite of Frank's deteriorating mental health. When Jon tries to begin the set with one of his own songs rather than one from the album, Frank has a breakdown and collapses on stage. They move into a cheap motel together, where a frustrated Jon tries to forcibly unmask Frank. Frank tries to escape and is hit by a car, smashing the fake head. He flees before Jon can see his real face.\nSometime later, Jon visits a dive bar where Clara, Nana, and Baraque are playing as a trio, and apologizes to them for having taken control of the band. After numerous failed attempts, he finally succeeds in tracking Frank to his hometown of Bluff City, Kansas, where he is living with his parents. Frank is scarred and balding from prolonged use of the mask.

It's one of the year's best films.\" Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote: \"At its best, The Russia House offers a rare and enthralling spectacle: the resurrection of buried hopes.\" Time Out less enthusiastically wrote: \"Overtaken by East-West events, and with an over-optimistic ending which sets personal against political loyalty, it's still highly enjoyable, wittily written, and beautiful to behold in places, at others somehow too glossy for its own good.\"Tom Stoppard's adapted screenplay was criticised by Vincent Canby in The New York Times: \"There is evidence of Mr. Stoppard's wit in the dialogue, but the lines are not easily spoken, which is not to say that they are unspeakable. They are clumsy.\" Roger Ebert held a similar view in the Chicago Sun-Times: \"What's good are the few emotional moments that break out of the weary spy formula: Connery declaring his love for Pfeiffer, or the British and Americans getting on each other's nerves. But these flashes of energy are isolated inside a screenplay that is static and boring, that drones on lifelessly through the le Carr\u00e9 universe, like some kind of space probe that continues to send back random information long after its mission has been accomplished.\"Sean Connery was praised for his portrayal of Barley, \"bluff, incorrigible, jazz-loving... his finest performance in ages.\" Variety wrote: \"As the flawed, unreliable publisher, Connery is in top form.\" Peter Travers in Rolling Stone thought he captured \"the 'splendid quiet' that le Carr\u00e9 found in Blair.\" Hal Hinson in The Washington Post wrote: \"This may be the most complex character Connery has ever played, and without question it's one of his richest performances. Connery shows the melancholy behind Barley's pickled charm, all the wasted years and unkept promises.\" Desson Howe, also in The Washington Post, wrote: \"Sean Connery, like Anthony Quinn, takes a role like a vitamin pill, downs it, then goes about his bighearted business of making the part his idiosyncratic own.\" However, he received criticism from the New York Times, who thought that the \"usually magnetic Mr. Connery... is at odds with Barley, a glib, lazy sort of man who discovers himself during this adventure. Mr. Connery goes through the movie as if driving in second gear.\"Michelle Pfeiffer also garnered critical plaudits for delivering \"the film's most persuasive performance... Miss Pfeiffer, sporting a credible Russian accent, brings to it a no-nonsense urgency that is missing from the rest of the movie,\" according to The New York Times. Desson Howe in The Washington Post wrote: \"As Katya, a mother who risks her love to smuggle a document and falls for a Westerner in the process, her gestures are entirely believable, her accent (at least to one set of Western ears) is quietly perfect.\" Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote that \"Pfeiffer, who gets more subtle and incisive with each film, is incandescent as Katya.\" Hal Hinson in The Washington Post congratulated her for portraying a rounded character: \"Her triumph goes beyond her facility with the Russian accent; other actresses could have done that. She's great at playing contradictions, at being tough yet yielding, cloaked yet open, direct yet oblique. What's she's playing, we suspect, is the great Russian game of hide-and-seek. But Pfeiffer gives it a personal dimension. Katya holds herself in check, but her wariness, one senses, is as much personal as it is cultural -- the result, perhaps, of her own secret wounds. It's one of the year's most full-blooded performances.\" However, Pfeiffer also had her detractors. Variety thought that her \"Russian accent proves very believable but she has limited notes to play.\" Time Out wrote that \"Pfeiffer can act, but her assumption of a role for which her pouty glamour is inappropriate \u2013 a Russian office-worker seen rubbing shoulders in the bus queues \u2013 is a jarring note.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1925 they merged with local rivals Rotherham Town to form Rotherham United who are still members of the Football League.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "472_2954", "text": "The club's roots go back to 1877, when the club was formed as Thornhill Football Club (later Thornhill United). George Cook was the trainer around this time. For many years the leading team in the area was Rotherham Town, who spent three seasons in the Football League while Thornhill United were still playing in the Sheffield & Hallamshire League. By the turn of the century, however, Town had resigned from the Football League and gone out of business; a new club of the same name later joined the Midland League. Meanwhile, Thornhill's fortunes were on the rise to the extent that in 1905 they laid claim to being the pre-eminent club in the town and changed their name to Rotherham County. For a period both clubs competed in the Midland League, finishing first and second in 1911\u201312. Rotherham County became members of the second division of the Football league in 1919 whilst Rotherham Town failed to become elected to the third division northern section the following year. By 1925 County's fortunes had declined and they had to seek re-election to the third division. By this time it had become clear that to have two professional clubs in the town was not sustainable. Talks had begun in February 1925 and in early May the two clubs merged to form Rotherham United. Days later the reformed club was formally re-elected to the Football League under its new name.\nThe red and white kit was adopted around 1930 after playing in amber and black, but there was no improvement in the club's fortunes: in 1931 they again had to apply for re-election. Immediately after the Second World War things looked up. The Millers won the only post-war edition of the Football League Third Division North Cup in 1946 beating Chester 5\u20134 on aggregate. They then finished as runners-up three time in succession between 1947 and 1949 and then were champions of Division Three (North) in 1951. Rotherham reached their highest ever league position of third in the Football League Second Division in 1955, when only goal average denied them a place in the top flight after they finished level on points with champions Birmingham City and runners-up Luton Town. During that season they had notable results including a 6\u20131 win over Liverpool. In 1961 the Millers beat Aston Villa 2\u20130 at Millmoor in the inaugural League Cup final first leg; they lost the second leg 3\u20130 however at Villa Park. The second leg was played the season after due to Villa having a 'Congested Fixture List'. The club held on to its place in Division Two until 1968 and then went into a decline that took them down to Division Four in 1973. In 1975 they were promoted back to the Third Division finishing in the 3rd promotion spot in the Fourth Division. The Millers won the Division Three title in the 1980\u201381 season, and missed out on a second consecutive promotion by four points, finishing seventh In the second tier (then Division 2) 1981\u201382. They have not finished this high since. This season also saw Rotherham accomplish their highest-scoring second-tier league double, beating Chelsea 6\u20130 at home (31 October 1981) and 4\u20131 away at Stamford Bridge (20 March 1982).During the 1990s Rotherham were promoted and relegated between the Football League's lowest two divisions and they slipped into the Fourth Division in 1991, just two years after being promoted, but reclaimed their status in the third tier (renamed Division Two for the 1992\u201393 season due to the launch of the FA Premier League) by finishing third in the Fourth Division in 1992. They survived at this level for five years, never looking like promotion contenders, before being relegated in 1997. In 1996 Rotherham United made their first trip to Wembley, beating Shrewsbury 2\u20131 to win the Football League Trophy, with two goals from Nigel Jemson giving Rotherham the win, with over 20,000 Rotherham United fans following them. In 1997, just after relegation to Division Three, Ronnie Moore took charge of Rotherham United. His first season ended in a mid-table finish and then his second in a play-off semi-final defeat on penalties to Leyton Orient. In 1999\u20132000 as Rotherham finished as Division Three runners-up and gained promotion to Division Two, where they finished runners-up and won a second successive promotion.\n\nRotherham managed to remain in Division One for four seasons, and after relegation to League One in 2005, Mick Harford took over as the Millers' manager, but was sacked after a run of 17 games without a win. Harford was replaced by youth team coach, Alan Knill. Early in 2006 it was announced that the club faced an uncertain future unless a funding gap in the region of \u00a3140,000 per month could be plugged. An intervention at the latest possible time by a consortium of local businessmen kept them in business. The final match of the 2005\u201306 season, home to Milton Keynes Dons, was a winner-take-all relegation showdown where a scoreless draw kept Rotherham up. Rotherham United began their second successive year in League One with a 10-point deficit as a result of the CVA which saved the club from liquidation. The club initially pulled the points back but, after losing key playmaker Lee Williamson and star striker Will Hoskins in the January transfer window, the Millers sat 13 points adrift of safety, making the threat of relegation inevitable. This resulted in Knill being sacked on 1 March, with Mark Robins becoming caretaker manager.\nRobins's position was made permanent on 6 April 2007, but he was not able to save Rotherham from relegation. The Millers spent the majority of the 2007\u201308 season in the automatic promotion places but in mid-March 2008 it was revealed that Rotherham had again entered administration and would be deducted 10 points. Local businessman Tony Stewart then took over as chairman for the 2008\u201309 season and took the club out of administration via a Creditors Voluntary Agreement, resulting in a 17-point deduction. The Millers were subsequently forced to leave Millmoor, their home of over 100 years, for the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield, after disputes with the landlords. The Millers had a successful season under the new regime, wiping out the point deficit and being in contention for a play-off place. Rotherham were also involved in two cup runs, reaching the Football League Trophy Northern Final and the League Cup last 16. This included victories over higher league opposition in the form of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Southampton, Sheffield Wednesday, Leicester City and Leeds United.\nMark Robins kept the majority of the team together from the 2008\u201309 campaign, whilst bolstering his squad with high calibre signings in the form of Nicky Law and the prolific goalscorer Adam Le Fondre. The 2009\u201310 season started well until Mark Robins controversially departed to rivals Barnsley in September, leaving the Millers at the top of the league. Former manager Ronnie Moore replaced him and led the club to their first ever play-off final and first trip to the new Wembley Stadium, where they lost 3\u20132 loss. In March 2011, following poor form he left Rotherham by mutual consent, and Andy Scott replaced him until he was sacked in March 2012. Steve Evans succeeded him, in the first season at the New York Stadium, and won promotion by finishing second in League Two. In the 2013\u201314 League One season, Rotherham gained a place in the League One play-offs, where they defeated Preston North End in the semi-finals to set up a second play-off final at Wembley Stadium in four years. In the final against Leyton Orient, the game went to a penalty shoot-out, where two saves from Adam Collin secured a second successive promotion for the club.In the 2014\u201315 Championship season, Rotherham's first after a nine-year absence, their survival was jeopardised by a points deduction for fielding the ineligible Farrend Rawson during their home win against Brighton & Hove Albion, Farrend Rawson's loan had expired two days prior to the match, and despite the club insisting it was an external administrative error, they were subsequently thrown back into a relegation battle. However, safety was secured in the penultimate game of the season with a 2\u20131 home victory against Reading. Rotherham sold key players from their promotion winning campaigns before the 2015\u201316 season, including Ben Pringle, Craig Morgan and Kari Arnason. Evans left the club in September and former Leeds United manager Neil Redfearn was appointed as his replacement, being sacked in February 2016 after a run of six defeats in eight games. Neil Warnock was appointed as manager for the rest of the season, and the club stayed up, finishing 21st. Warnock left the club in May 2016 after not agreeing a contract extension. Alan Stubbs became the new Rotherham boss in June 2016, but was sacked in October. Rotherham replaced Stubbs with Kenny Jackett, who himself was replaced with Paul Warne, as Rotherham finished the season bottom of the league and were relegated to League One.At the first attempt, Rotherham returned to the Championship, defeating Shrewsbury in the 2018 play-off final.\nRotherham were relegated from the Championship the following season on the penultimate game of the campaign. The COVID-19 pandemic struck during the 2019\u201320 season and cut short Rotherham's ambitions of being promoted the 'old fashioned way'. Their final game before the March 2020 lockdown was a 3\u20131 loss away at Rochdale. The Millers were eventually promoted through points per game in 2nd place behind Coventry City. Their return to the Championship was one which fans watched from home due to the persistence of the pandemic. However, despite the best efforts of the Millers, Rotherham would be relegated. Rotherham took the season to the final day where a victory would see them survive if Sheffield Wednesday and Derby County drew with each other. The draw did indeed occur, but Rotherham suffered an 88th minute equaliser against Cardiff City, which was enough to keep Derby in the Championship and Rotherham to be relegated to League One for the 2021\u201322 season. In the 2021\u201322 season, the Millers were promoted back to the Championship as runners-up, defeating Gillingham 2\u20130 on the final day of the season. The club also won the 2021\u201322 EFL Trophy at Wembley Stadium after defeating Sutton United 4\u20132 after extra time. Early in the 2022\u201323 season, manager Paul Warne departed for Derby County, being replaced by Exeter City boss Matt Taylor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They are the \"middle ground\" of defenders, playing closer to the line of scrimmage than the defensive backs (secondary), but farther back than the defensive linemen.\nAs such, linebackers play a hybrid role and are often the most versatile players on the defensive side of the ball; they can be asked to play roles similar to either a defensive lineman (such as stopping the runner on a running play) or a defensive back (such as dropping back into pass coverage).  How linebackers play their positions depends on the defensive alignment, the philosophy of the coaching staff, and the particular play the offense may call.\nLinebackers are divided into middle linebackers, sometimes called inside linebackers, and outside linebackers.  The middle linebacker, often called \"Mike\", is frequently the \"quarterback of the defense\".  His central role on the field means he is in the best position to call defensive plays and direct shifts and changes based on what the offense is doing.  Outside linebackers are often in a position to blitz, a defensive maneuver where the player rushes into the offensive backfield to disrupt a running play or sack the quarterback on passing plays.  Besides \"Mike\", other nicknames such as \"Sam\", \"Will\", or \"Jack\", are commonly used to refer to various linebacking roles.\nHistorically, some of the most impactful defensive players, such as Pro Football Hall of Fame members Chuck Bednarik, Dick Butkus, Jack Lambert, Ray Lewis, Ray Nitschke, Mike Singletary, Brian Urlacher, and Lawrence Taylor, were linebackers.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "218_4064", "text": "Havig was born on May 6, 1949, in Powell, Wyoming, and raised as a Mormon.

Conner later sold the ground to John and Sarah Berry, who donated 32 acres (13 ha) of their land to Madison County on the condition that the county seat be moved from Pendleton to Anderson. John Berry laid out the first plat of Anderson on November 7, 1827. In 1828 the seat of justice was moved from Pendleton to Anderson.\nThe city is named for Chief William \"Adam\" Anderson, whose mother was Lenape and whose father was of Swedish descent. Chief Anderson's name in Lenape was Kikthawenund, meaning \"creaking boughs\". The Lenape village was known as \"Anderson's Town\", though the Moravian missionaries called it \"The Heathen Town Four Miles Away\". Anderson was also known as \"Andersonton\" before being formally organized as Anderson.\nIntroduction of internal improvements by the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act caused a growth in the population in 1837. In December 1838, Anderson was incorporated as a town with 350 inhabitants. The Central Canal, a branch of the Wabash and Erie Canal, was planned to come through Anderson. Work continued on the canal during 1838 and the beginning of 1839, but the work was soon suspended by the state following effects of the Panic of 1837. The town again became a sleepy village until 1849, when it was incorporated a second time as a town. Many new commercial ventures located around the courthouse square.\nThis incorporation was short-lived, and Anderson once again went back to village status in 1852. However, with the completion of the Indianapolis Bellefontaine Railroad, as well as their station in 1852, Anderson burst to life. The third incorporation of Anderson as a town occurred on June 9, 1853. The population continued to increase. On August 28, 1865, with a population of nearly 1,300 people, Anderson was incorporated as a city.\nBetween 1853 and the late 19th century, twenty industries of various sizes located there. On March 31, 1887, natural gas was discovered in Anderson. As the Indiana gas boom began, this discovery led new businesses that could use natural gas, such as glass-making, to move to the city. Anderson grew to such proportions that a Cincinnati newspaper editor labeled the city \"The Pittsburgh on White River\". Other appellations were \"Queen City of the Gas Belt\" and (because of the vulcanizing and rubber tire manufacturing business) \"Puncture Proof City\".\nIn 1897 the Interurban Railroad was born in Anderson. Charles Henry, a large stock holder, coined the term \"Interurban\" in 1893. It continued to operate until 1941.\nThe year 1912 spelled disaster for Anderson: the natural gas ran out. The city had left its gas-powered lights on day and night, and there are stories of a pocket of natural gas being lit in the river and burning for a prolonged period for the spectacle of it. The result of the loss of natural gas was that several factories moved out. The whole city slowed down. The Commercial Club (formed on November 18, 1905) was the forerunner of the present chamber of commerce.\nThis club persuaded the Remy brothers to stay in Anderson and others to locate there. For decades, Delco Remy and Guide Lamp (later Fisher Guide), which during World War II built the M3 submachine gun and the FP-45 Liberator pistol for the Allies, were the top two employers in the city. From 1913 through the 1950s, the Ward-Stilson Company was one of the country's largest producers of uniforms, regalia, furniture and props for the Freemasons, the Odd Fellows, and dozens of other U.S. fraternal organizations.\nThe Church of God of Anderson located its world headquarters in Anderson in 1905. Anderson Bible School was opened in 1917, and this was separated from Gospel Trumpet (now known as Warner Press) in 1925. At the same time, it became known as Anderson Bible School and Seminary. In 1925, the name was changed to Anderson College and eventually to Anderson University in 1988.\nOver the years, 17 different types of automobiles were manufactured in Anderson, with the Lambert family among the city's leaders in its development and the Buckeye Gasoline Buggy the Lambert product. Many other inventions were perfected in Anderson, including the gas regulator (Miron G. Reynolds), the stamp vending machine (Frank P. Dunn), clothes presser (H. Donald Forse), \"Irish Mail\" handcars (Hugh Hill), flower car for funeral homes (Francis M. McClain, automatic gearshift (Von D. Polhemus)), Sisson choke (Glenn Sisson), and the vulcanizing process to retread tires (Charles E. Miller).\nAnderson hosted a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise for the 1949\u201350 season, being one of the smaller cities to have had a major league franchise in a Big Four American sport. The Anderson Packers were a founding member of the NBA (under that name), but folded after one season.Like most other industrial cities in Indiana and the Rust Belt as a whole, Anderson suffered tremendously from deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s. For example, nearly 22,000 people were employed by General Motors in the 1970s in Anderson; by 2006 this number had declined to fewer than 2,600. Anderson has since struggled with higher rates of poverty and unemployment.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "560_162", "question": "What sport does penalty play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "560_4930", "text": "The referees make most penalty calls. Linesmen may stop play and enforce only certain infractions (as defined by the rules governing the league in which they officiate), such as \"too many players on the ice\". The official will initially put an arm in the air to signal a penalty; the official will stop play only once the offending team has control of the puck, or play is stopped by normal means. A delayed penalty is one in which the penalty is called but play is not yet stopped because the non-offending team retains the puck. Because the play will stop immediately upon the offending team gaining control of the puck, the goaltender of the non-offending team will often go to the players' bench upon seeing the arm signal to allow an extra attacker on the ice until the play is stopped. Because the offending team will not be able to take a shot on goal before the play is stopped, this is generally seen as a risk-free play. However, there have been instances in which the non-offending team accidentally puts the puck into their own net, usually on a failed backwards pass. Once the offending team touches the puck and the play is stopped, the referee will signal the specific infraction. If the penalized player was injured on the play and cannot return, another player on the team would serve the penalty if it involves a team being short-handed.\nIn the NHL, if the non-offending team scores a goal in a delayed penalty situation, then it is treated as if a goal was scored during that penalty. Thus, if the delayed penalty is a minor, the penalty is waved off. If the delayed penalty is a double-minor, only the first two-minute block is waved off, and the offending player must still serve the second time block. These rules used to be in college hockey as well, until the 2010\u20132011 season, when it was changed so that the penalty would still be imposed even if a goal was scored. Major penalties, misconduct penalties and match penalties, which are not affected by goals, are enforced in the usual manner, in both college hockey and the NHL, whether or not a goal is scored.The offending player or players are sent to the penalty box where they must remain until the penalty has expired. Typically a team will not be allowed to replace the penalized player on the ice; the player will return directly to the ice once the penalty has expired. This creates a power play during which the penalized team will have one player fewer than their opponent and is said to be \"short-handed\". If two players on a team are in the penalty box at the same time, the situation is called a \"five on three\" (as is customary, the goalies are not counted in this expression) or \"two-man advantage\". Additional players may be penalized, but a team will never play with fewer than three skaters on the ice. Additional penalties will be delayed until one of the earlier penalties has expired (see stacked penalties below).\nIn leagues which play with a shorthanded overtime (with only three or four attackers on the ice), should a team be penalized with only three players on the ice, the penalized player may be immediately substituted by the offending team, but an additional skater is then allowed on the other team to create an advantage, until a five-on-three is produced.  If a penalty in this situation expires without a goal being scored, the penalized player will be allowed back on the ice and will play normally until there is a stoppage; both teams will then be reduced back to the correct numbers. Ending coincidental penalties produce a similar situation, with both teams playing with additional players until play is stopped, allowing teams to be reduced again.While goaltenders can be assessed penalties, a goaltender cannot go to the penalty box and the penalty must be instead served by another player from their team who was on the ice at the time of the infraction (the PIM will be charged to the goaltender). If the goaltender receives either (a) three major penalties (NHL Rule 28.2), (b) one game misconduct penalty (NHL Rule 28.4), or (c) one match penalty (NHL Rule 28.5) however, he or she is ejected for the remainder of the game and must be substituted.\nWhile a team is short-handed, they are permitted to ice the puck as they wish, without having the icing infraction called against them. This allows short-handed teams to relieve pressure more easily when defending with fewer skaters than their opponents. This exemption does not apply to teams whose opponents have pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker (unless the defending team is killing a penalty at the same time).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "560_4931", "text": "In the NHL, infractions that result in penalties include:\n\nAbuse of officials\nArguing with, insulting, using obscene gestures or language directed at or in reference to, or deliberately making violent contact with any on or off-ice official. This generally is issued in addition to other penalties or as a bench penalty against a coach or off-ice player, and is grounds for ejection under a game misconduct or match penalty in most leagues including the NHL.\nAggressor penalty\nAssessed to a player who engages in a fight with an unwilling combatant. This is independent of the instigator penalty, and both are usually not assessed to the same player at one time (in that case the player's penalty for fighting is usually escalated to attempt to injure, a match penalty).\nAttempt to injure\nDeliberately trying to harm an opponent, in any manner. This type of infraction carries an automatic match penalty.\nBiting\nCarries a major penalty (5:00) and Game Misconduct.\nBoarding\nPushing, tripping or checking an opposing player violently into the boards.\nButt-ending (or Stabbing)\nJabbing an opponent with the end of the shaft of the stick.

Starting in the 2004\u201305 AHL season and advanced to the NHL in the a year later, an automatic delay of game penalty is charged to goaltenders that go into the corners behind the goal line (outside a trapezoid-shaped area just behind the net) to play the puck. Some delay of game offenses, such as taking too long to send players to take a faceoff, are not punished with a penalty: instead, the official may choose to eject the centre of the offending team from the face-off circle and order him replaced with another player already on the ice. An unsuccessful coach's challenge will result in a minor penalty for delay of game for the first unsuccessful challenge and a double-minor penalty for each additional unsuccessful challenge.\nDiving (or \"embellishment\")\nFalling to the ice after a hit, exaggerating the effect of the hit in an attempt to draw a penalty for the opposing team.\nElbowing\nHitting an opponent with the elbow. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.\nEye-gouging\nCarries a major penalty and often a match penalty.\nFighting\nEngaging in a physical altercation with an opposing player, usually involving the throwing of punches with gloves removed. Minor altercations such as simple pushing and shoving, and punching with gloves still in place, are generally called as roughing.\nGoaltender interference\nPhysically impeding or checking the goaltender. Visually impeding the goaltender's view of the play with the body, called \"screening\", is legal; but at no time may a goaltender be hit or checked.\nGoaltender leaving the crease\nA goaltender may not leave the vicinity of his crease during an altercation. Once he has left the crease during an altercation, he may be given a penalty.\nHead-butting\nHitting an opponent with the head. A match penalty is called for doing so.High-sticking\nTouching an opponent with the stick above shoulder level. A minor penalty is assessed to the player. If blood is drawn, a double-minor (4 minutes) is usually called.  A common (yet false) belief is that blood drawn automatically warrants a double-minor. There is no such rule; this is, however, the precedent that has been in place for years.  Referees may use their discretion to assess only a minor penalty even though blood was drawn.  They may also assess a double-minor when blood is not drawn, if they believe that the player was sufficiently injured or that the offending player used excessively reckless action with his stick.  If a player, while in the action of \"following through\" on a shot, strikes an opposing player in the head or face area with his stick, high sticking is not called unless the referee can determine that the player taking the shot was deliberately aiming to strike the opposing player. A penalty is also not called when the puck is hit by a high stick, but play will be stopped and the ensuing faceoff will take place at a spot which gives the non-offending team an advantage. Also, a goal that is scored by means of hitting the puck with a stick above the height of the crossbar will not be counted unless it is done by a player of the defending team. (Note that the requirements for high-sticking the puck for purposes of allowing/disallowing goal is different from the other forms of high-sticking.)  NHL referees can use on-ice video review to confirm or overturn a double-minor high sticking call.\nHolding\nGrabbing an opponent's body, equipment or clothing with the hands or stick. Generally a minor; USA Hockey rules call for a major and a game misconduct for grabbing and holding a facemask or visor.\nHolding the stick\nGrabbing and holding an opponent's stick, also called when a player deliberately wrenches a stick from the hands of an opposing player or forces the opponent to drop it by any means that is not any other infraction such as Slashing.\nHooking\nUsing a stick as a hook to slow an opponent, no contact is required under new standards.\nIllegal check to the head\nAs of the start of the 2010\u201311 NHL season, any form of \"a hit to an opponent, where the player's head is targeted and/or the principal point of contact\" is punishable with a combination five-minute major penalty and game misconduct, due to the increasing concern following concussion injuries to NHL players following incidents such as David Booth and Marc Savard's concussions in the 2009\u201310 NHL season. A second incident of this type caused by the same player in a season (or post-season playoffs) results in an automatic suspension for the following game their team plays, with the potential for increasing durations of suspension from active play, for any subsequent checks to opposing players' head areas. The following season, it was changed to any hit to an opposing player's head that is targeted and the principal point of contact. An illegal check to the head is punishable with either a two-minute minor penalty or a match penalty. In the 2013\u201314 NHL season, the rule was clarified to \"A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head was the main point of contact and such contact to the head was avoidable is not permitted (known as illegal check to the head). As mentioned before, that is punishable with either a two-minute minor penalty or a match penalty.Rule 48 \u2013 Illegal Check to the Head\nIllegal equipment\nUsing equipment that does not meet regulations, either by size (length, width) or number (two sticks) or other guidelines (e.g. a goaltender's facemask can no longer be the \"Jason Voorhees\"-style form-fit mask, a skater may not have a stick with a curve exceeding 3/4\" (19 mm), nor may they play with a goaltender's stick (a goaltender may play with a regular player's stick). If a player (non-goaltender) breaks a stick, it is mandatory to drop the stick immediately and play without it until getting a replacement from the bench. Otherwise a penalty will be assessed to the offending player (some game summaries call this \"playing with a broken stick\"). In addition, in the NHL a player may not pick a broken stick up off the ground after it has been dropped (they can only receive a stick from another player or from the bench; goaltenders may not go to the bench but must have a stick carried out to them). This rule is generally not enforced in amateur leagues except for broken sticks or egregiously out-of-spec equipment, as the cost of acquiring gear that meets NHL specifications since a 2005 (and further in 2013) rule change is prohibitive, especially for goalies. Goaltenders will now receive a two-game suspension for the use of oversized equipment. Their teams will also be fined $25,000, the trainer will be docked $10,000, the coach and general manager fined $50,000 and the owner fined $100,000.\nInstigator penalty\nAn instigator of an altercation is a player who demonstrates any of the following actions: distance travelled; gloves off first; first punch thrown; menacing attitude. A player deemed an instigator will receive an instigating minor penalty. A player who instigates a fight in the final five minutes of a game (or in overtime in the regular season) will instead be charged a game misconduct and given an automatic one-game suspension. The length of the suspension would double for each additional incident. The player's coach will be fined $10,000, a penalty that would double for each recurrence.\nInterference\nImpeding an opponent who does not have the puck, or impeding any player from the bench. No contact is required under the new standards.\nJoining a fight\nAlso called the \"third man in\" rule, the first person who was not part of a fight when it broke out but participates in said fight once it has started for any reason (even to pull the players apart) is charged with an automatic game misconduct in addition to any other penalties they receive for fighting.\nKicking\nKicking an opponent with the skate or skate blade. Kicking carries a match penalty if done with intent to injure, but otherwise carries a major penalty and a game misconduct. (Under Hockey Canada rules, kicking or attempting to kick an opponent always carries a Match Penalty regardless of intent.)\nKneeing\nHitting an opponent with the knee. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.\nLeaving the penalty bench\nA penalized player who leaves the penalty bench before his penalty has expired, whether play is in progress or not, shall incur an additional minor penalty after serving his unexpired penalty. Any player who, having entered the penalty bench, leaves the penalty bench prior to the expiration of his penalty for the purpose of challenging an official's ruling, shall be assessed a game misconduct penalty. He shall also be automatically suspended for at least the next three regular league or playoff games of his club. A player exiting the penalty bench, or player's bench, during an altercation or for the purpose of starting an altercation will be given a game misconduct, and suspended the next 10 games.\nParticipating in the play beyond the centre red line (goaltender)\nA rare infraction, carries a minor penalty and is only assessed against the goaltender.\nPlaying with too many sticks\nWhen a player plays with more than one stick. For example, if a goaltender were to lose his stick and a player from his team skates over to pick up the goaltender stick and then, while skating back to the goaltender with both sticks, attempts to touch a live puck with either stick, will be called for Playing with too many sticks.\nRoughing\nPushing or shoving after the whistle has been blown or when it takes place away from the play (often called against a player from each team, resulting in a coincidental minors situation, but can also be called on a single player); also called when the hands make contact with an opponent's head/face on an otherwise legal check; called in non-checking leagues when a body check is made. Non-checking leagues may also refer to this as simply 'body checking'. In the NHL, a minor penalty for roughing is assessed when a player intentionally removes the helmet of an opponent. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.\nSecondary altercation\nThis infraction is not listed in the NHL Rulebook, but it is prevalent in the Central Hockey League (United States) and other minor leagues. It is most commonly issued when players engage in or attempt to engage in fight after the original fight (between two separate players). This infraction carries an automatic game misconduct penalty.\nSlashing\nSwinging a stick at an opponent, no contact is required under new standards. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.\nSlew footing\nThis occurs when a player uses his feet or knees to knock an opponent's skates out from under him with a kicking or leg dragging motion from behind. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result. Slew footing as a separate infraction does not exist in the USA Hockey rulebook as of 2005-2006.\nSpearing\nStabbing an opponent with the stick blade. It carries an automatic major penalty and game misconduct.\nStarting the wrong lineup\nThis very rare bench minor penalty is assessed when the offending team's starting lineup contains any player not listed in the lineup submitted before the game. For this to be called, the captain of the non-offending team must bring this breach of the rules to the referee's attention immediately at the first stoppage of play. Also the penalty may be assessed if a player is not put on the scoresheet at the beginning of the game and plays. The only way for this to be called is if the official scorer notifies the referee of this oversight.\nSubstitution infraction (Illegal Substitution)\nThis rare bench minor penalty is assessed when a substitution or addition is attempted during a stoppage of play after the linesmen have signaled no more substitutions (once the face-off is set) or if a team pulls its goaltender and then attempts to have the goaltender re-enter play at any time other than during a stoppage of play. Too many men on the ice and/or starting the wrong lineup can also simply be called a substitution infraction.\nThrowing the stick/Throwing stick/Throwing equipment\nOften accompanied by a penalty shot. If any player on the ice who throws his stick or any part thereof or any other object (i.e. equipment) in the direction of the puck or an opponent in any zone, except when such act has been penalized by the assessment of a penalty shot or the awarding of a goal then a minor penalty will be assessed. Should any player, coach, or non-playing person on the players\u2019 bench or penalty bench throw anything on the ice during the progress of the game or during a stoppage of play, a bench minor penalty unsportsmanlike conduct shall be assessed. Can be upgraded to game misconduct or match penalty depending on severity.\nToo many men on the ice\nHaving more than the allowable number of players (six, including the goaltender, if not already short handed) on the ice involved in the play at any given time. \"Involved in the play\" is key; players that are entering the ice as substitutes for players coming off (line changing) may enter the ice once the player returning to the bench is less than five feet from his team's bench (Rule 74.1); at that point the returning player is considered out of the play, even if the play passes in front of the bench, unless he actively makes a move for the puck. Players entering the ice are part of the play as soon as their skates touch the ice.\nTripping\nUsing a stick or one's body to trip an opponent, no contact is required under new standards. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.\nUnsportsmanlike conduct\nArguing with a referee, fan, opponent or teammate; using slurs against an opponent, teammate or fan; playing with illegal equipment; making obscene gestures or abusing an official, fan, opponent or teammate. Can carry either a minor, major, misconduct, game misconduct or match penalty, depending on the gravity of the infraction (for instance, using obscene language to a referee initially results in a minor, but making an obscene gesture to an opponent, teammate, fan or official carries a game misconduct.) Also, in some leagues the penalty progression is different for players and team officials (for example, in the USA Hockey rulebook players get a minor for their first infraction, a misconduct for their second and a game misconduct for their third, whereas the option of a misconduct is removed for coaches; in addition, after each penalty for  a team official, the penalty count resets itself). Unsportsmanlike conduct may also be called if a player drops gloves and stick in preparation for a fight, but the non-offending player does not drop the corresponding equipment and has committed no action (verbal or physical harassment) to attempt to instigate a fight. Since 2008, the NHL has ruled that standing in front of an opposing goaltender and engaging \"in actions such as waving his arms or stick in front of the goaltender's face, for the purpose of improperly interfering with and/or distracting the goaltender\" will draw a minor unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, a rule interpretation inspired by the play of Sean Avery against Martin Brodeur.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "560_4927", "text": "A penalty in ice hockey is a punishment for an infringement of the rules.

The offending team may not replace the player on the ice (although there are some exceptions, such as fighting), leaving them short-handed as opposed to full strength. When the opposing team is said to be on a power play, they will have one more player on the ice than the short-handed team.

Many supporters in the wider Newport area favoured greater identification with the City of Newport and a continuation of the historic traditions of Newport RFC. Several names were suggested but all were rejected by the WRU. In the end, the WRU decided the region would be called the Gwent Dragons. However, initial response to the new region was mixed, with many fans unsure whether to buy a season ticket for the new side or to stick to their local clubs. The company set up to run the side entered administration before a game had been played, and as a compromise the word \"Newport\" was added to the team name in a double-sized font, whilst \"Gwent\" was reduced. This addition and choice of kit added a greater Newport emphasis to the region and polarised the regions' fan base: some supporters of Ebbw Vale, Pontypool, Cross Keys and Newbridge turned their backs on the regional side, claiming that Gwent was no longer being equally represented. This debate continued, with the Dragons being accused of favouritism towards their Newport feeder club rather than the other feeder clubs.The Newport Action Group, among others, claimed the side has lost more supporters by including the name \"Gwent\" in its title. The crowds supporting Newport Gwent Dragons averaged 5,154 for the 2005\u201306 season, whereas in the 2002\u201303 season, Newport RFC was Wales' best supported club and British rugby's fourth best with an average attendance of 8,302 \u2013 behind English Premiership clubs Leicester, Gloucester and Northampton. In the 2006\u201307 season, attendance averaged 5,629 at Rodney Parade.\nOn the 27 June 2022, the Dragons announced their rebranding as Dragons RFC.

The Bajau community referred to it as pisang jaba. While the name Saba also refers to a variety of banana in both Tagalog and Visayan languages. The word in Visayan has the meaning of \"noisy\", which in turn is derived from Sanskrit Sabh\u0101 meaning 'congregation, crowd' related to 'noisy mob'. Perhaps due to local dialect, the word Saba has been pronounced as Sabah by the local community.

Instead during the Song dynasty, they referred to the whole island as Po Ni (also pronounced Bo Ni), which is the same name they used to refer to the Sultanate of Brunei at the time.

Development of Hang-On began with a project brought to him by a colleague who asked him to implement a torsion bar into an arcade game design\u2014although the bar proved too difficult to implement in the final game design and springs were used instead.  Suzuki was given the freedom to decide what kind of game to design, and as a fan of cars and motorcycles, he chose to design a game where the arcade cabinet simulated an actual motorcycle and players would have to move side to side on the motorcycle to turn. He also had a desire to make his game better than Pole Position, a Namco game which had beaten out Sega's Turbo in popularity. In developing the game, Suzuki wanted to make his new motorcycle racing game a realistic experience. His initial desire was to create a 3D game, though the technology of the time made full 3D environments impossible. Instead, he specified the design of Sega's new Super Scaler arcade system board\u2014initially known as Sega Hang-On hardware\u2014enhanced from the existing VCO Object system board that would use multiple CPUs and back end DSP compatibility to create 3D effects, while using 16-bit graphics. The game achieves its 3D effects using a sprite-scaling technique.In designing the game, Suzuki had to decide on a style of motorcycle racing for the game. Suzuki himself was a fan of dirt bikes, along with motocross and Enduro, and dirt bikes would later be used in Suzuki's Enduro Racer. However, Sega's market research concluded that road-based GP 500 racing was more popular worldwide. While Suzuki was doing research for the game, he admired the riding style of Freddie Spencer, who had just become the youngest person to win a motorcycling world championship at 21 years old. According to Suzuki, \"Freddie Spencer's riding style, it was so nice. And my game was like a homage. That's the reason I wanted to make it \u2013 Freddie Spencer, he rode a Honda bike, and I loved the way he hung on!\" Two cabinet designs were made: a basic version with a handlebar and levers, and the deluxe cabinet which featured the full motorcycle to be tilted. Suzuki had additional features he wanted to implement that could not be done due to cost, including a gyroscope to simulate motorcycle acceleration and deceleration. The title is derived from when the biker is turning and has to \"hang on\" to the bike while the bike is leaning, which Suzuki had read in a Japanese bike magazine.  Suzuki later learned the technique was called \"hang off\" in North America, but he chose to keep the former name.Hang-On is considered well-regarded for its music, which was composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi. He came to Suzuki's attention after Suzuki heard he played in a band. Suzuki wanted songs for the soundtrack to Hang-On that would be like what a band would play. This led to Kawaguchi writing four songs for the game, including \"Theme of Love\", the game's theme song. Kawaguchi made use of the hardware's PCM sampling and added drum samples to use Hang-On's Yamaha YM2203 sound chip to its maximum potential and create a more realistic soundtrack featuring rock music, which was uncommon in arcade games at the time. He also created the game's sound effects. Kawaguchi did not program his own music into the game; he instead wrote out his soundtrack by hand, made a demo, and gave that to the sound programmer. He has said this was because he did not own a sequencer, and that this method was faster for him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Days after, Young-ju begins to show a disturbing attraction for her father and jealous rejection towards her mother. Meanwhile Ji-won gets more anonymous calls and sees a long-haired ghost playing Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" on the piano. She finds out that her number originally belonged to a missing teenager, Jin-hee, and that its two subsequent owners had died mysteriously in unusual circumstances.\nJi-won visits Jin-hee's mother at their home and finds a diary and a picture of Jin-hee and Jin-hee's best friend, Sang-mi. Ji-won goes to Sang-mi who is now blind and deaf. Since Sang-mi was haunted by Jin-hee's spirit, she decides to stab her own eyes and ears to make it leave her. She says that before she went missing, Jin-hee was obsessively in love with an older man whom she tried hard to impress by practicing \"Moonlight Sonata\". However they broke up even though she was pregnant with his child. Ji-won explains to Young-ju's parents that Young-ju could be in danger, but Chang-hoon's refusal to accept it upsets Ji-won. In Ji-won's flashback, it is shown that Ho-jung had been infertile, so Ji-won gave Ho-jung her egg for in vitro fertilisation in order to conceive Young-ju. In this sense, Young-ju is not Ji-won's niece but her biological daughter, whom she loves and cares deeply for.\nJi-won continues her investigation into Jin-hee's diary.

Believing that Chang-hoon has something to do with Jin-hee's disappearance (more likely death), Ji-won threatens to tell his wife if he does not cooperate. Young-ju, who is possessed by Jin-hee's ghost, goes to Ji-won's house, in Bang Bae, jumps down the stairs and is hospitalized.

A Miss Walsh walks into the offices of Sally Lockhart's office (Sally is now working as a financial consultant) about some poor business advice Sally gave her; as a result Miss Walsh has lost her life savings. Sally vows to get the money back and investigate Anglo-Baltic, the company Miss Walsh lost all her money from. We also learn that Sally has a huge but lovable black dog called Chaka and that Frederick Garland (Sally's friend from The Ruby in the Smoke) is in love with Sally but that she is unsure of her feelings and so continuously refuses to decide on whether to marry him. Sally's friend Jim Taylor (now working as a stagehand in a local theatre) helps stage magician Alistair Mackinnon escape two men Mackinnon is certain plan to kill him. Jim takes Mackinnon to Frederick and Frederick's uncle Webster at their photography shop/private investigations office in Burton Street where Mackinnon proves to Jim, Webster and Frederick that he has spiritual abilities (he can see things having to do with an object by touching it) and tells them of a murder he saw by touching a man's cigar case. Mackinnon tells them that he believes that the man knows that he (Mackinnon) knows about the murder, and is therefore terrified for his life. Jim and Frederick go to a spiritualist seance as part of their work as private detectives. The seance involves the table shaking from side to side and objects being thrown across the room; the medium (a Mrs. Nellie Budd) also has trance during which she says things that connect to a mysterious business tied up to Anglo-Baltic called North Star. Frederick manages to get a photograph of Nellie's arms during the seance. Later, Frederick tells Sally what he has learnt. She tells him what she knows about the former owner of Anglo-Baltic and current owner of North Star, Axel Bellmann. Sally suspects that Bellman has manufactured Anglo-Baltic's collapse to fund North Star; she believes him to be very vicious.\nLater that week, Mackinnon is to perform at a charity event. He asks Frederick to come with him for protection. Frederick asks his aristocratic friend Charles to come with him as Charles can tell Frederick who the people at the event are. While performing, Mackinnon sees the man he believes to be after him in the audience. He gets the message to Frederick leading Frederick to find out that this man is Axel Bellmann. Frederick and Charles also come across Lord Wytham and his ethereally beautiful daughter Lady Mary. Mackinnon disappears, much to Frederick and Charles's annoyance. At Sally's office the next morning, Mr. Windlesham, an employee of Bellmann, tries to intimidate her and so stop her investigations into Bellmann but she refuses. In the meantime, we learn that Bellmann has made a deal with the almost-bankrupt Lord Wytham: if Bellmann marries Lady Mary Wytham, Lord Wytham's debts will be paid off. Wytham, repulsed by the deal, sees no option but to accept: if he does not, he will go to debtors' prison. Meanwhile, Frederick goes to Nellie to show her his photograph from the seance: it shows her using fake arms as well as wires to cause the table to move and the objects to be thrown. She responds cheerfully, but agrees to tell him more about her trances (which she claims are genuine). She cannot remember what happens during them; she has had them since she was young; she used to have them while her identical twin sister Jessie Saxon never did. Frederick tells her what she said during her trance. She says it sounds like nonsense and is surprised that he takes it seriously. Sally visits Bellmann and orders him to pay her Miss Walsh's lost money but he refuses. Unfortunately for Nellie, Sally drops Nellie's business card in Bellmann's office. Jim goes to look for Mackinnon and meets a woman called Isabel Meredith. She tells Jim that she is desperately in love in Mackinnon but knows he cannot be with her. She also tells Jim where Mackinnon is. Meanwhile, Charles discovers that Bellmann and Lady Mary Wytham are engaged. When investigating, Jim meets Lady Mary and immediately falls in love with her. She tells him that she cannot marry Bellmann and he gives her his card. Later, Isabel's room is ransacked by Bellmann's henchmen. Frightened, she tells them where Mackinnon will be performing but Frederick, Sally and Jim are able to save him by allowing him to get away from that venue so he is not harmed. Before he escapes, Sally demands he tell her the real reason Bellmann is after him. He tells her that he is Nellie Budd's son by Lord Wytham but then runs away from her (as well as the henchmen) before she can find out more. Isabel comes to stay in Burton Street.\nFrederick goes to see Nellie again but finds she has been attacked. She is taken to a hospital for treatment; there is doubt over whether she will survive. Windlesham pays a hitman to kill Sally. Meanwhile, Sally finds out that North Star is a weapons company that plans to build a massive \"Steam Gun\" capable of shooting thousands of bullets at once. Frederick learns how the Steam Gun works and comes across Nellie's sister Jessie in the north of England. He tells Jessie about Nellie's injury and Jessie tells him that Mackinnon is not Nellie's son but Nellie's lover. Jessie decides to go to Nellie. Frederick learns from a hostel owner that Mackinnon is married to Lady Mary Wytham. It becomes clear that Bellmann knows this and that is why Bellmann is trying to kill Mackinnon. It becomes clear that Nellie was not Mackinnon's lover and that it was Nellie who made Mackinnon's and Lady Mary's marriage possible. Windlesham's hitman tries to kill Sally but, unbeknownst to him, the woman he tries to kill is really Isabel and his knife gets stuck in her underclothing. He kills Chaka instead (and is himself killed) and Sally is devastated by Chaka's loss. Next day, Sally goes into her office to find it ransacked. Neither her landlord nor the police are helpful. Sally asks Frederick to help; Frederick and Jim manage to retrieve the stolen files from Bellmann's house. Sally realises that the Steam Gun is for use against one's own population. Jim (now aware of Lady Mary's marriage) meets Lady Mary in Hyde Park; they talk and, on impulse, briefly kiss. He advises her to make her marriage to Mackinnon public and she tells him where Mackinnon is hiding. Sally tells Isabel that Mackinnon is married, leaving Isabel quietly devastated. Jim and Frederick go to see Mackinnon and find him being attacked by Bellmann's henchmen. Jim and Frederick fight, with a moment of instrumental help from Mackinnon, against the henchmen, eventually knocking them out. They tie them up and send them in a cab to a police station. Mackinnon comes back to Burton Street. After everyone but Sally and Frederick are left alone together (with a brief interruption). Sally tells Frederick that she loves him and takes him upstairs whispering \"Not a word - not a word.\"  They sleep together, and afterwards Sally lets Frederick ask her to marry him, and agrees. Meanwhile, Windlesham and Bellmann have set fire to the building. Jim smells it and warns everyone else. Everyone climbs out of the window (Jim falls and breaks his leg) apart from Isabel who refuses to leave her room. Frederick climbs back up to save her but she refuses to move and the ceiling collapses, killing them both.\nAfter Frederick's body is found after the fire, Sally walks around in a daze. Unknowingly, she goes to the North Star headquarters and tells Bellmann that she is there to see him. Back in London, despite Jim's broken leg, he manages to walk to where Mackinnon is staying. Mackinnon sees where Sally is using his psychic powers and Jim makes him come to the North Star headquarters. Back at the North Star, Sally tells Bellmann that she loved Frederick and that Bellmann killed him. Bellmann tells Sally that he wants power and that he believes the Steam Gun will give it to him. He asks her to marry him, telling her that he thinks her a better match for him than Lady Mary would have been. At that moment, Mackinnon comes in to bring Sally to Jim. Sally tells Mackinnon to wait before agreeing to marry Bellmann in exchange for the money Miss Walsh lost from the collapse of Anglo-Baltic. Bellmann gives the money to Sally who tells Mackinnon to take it to Miss Walsh. Mackinnon takes the money to Jim and Jim suspects Sally has a plan. At Sally's request, Bellmann takes her to see the Steam Gun. While chiding Bellmann for his failure to understand people like Frederick, Sally sets the Steam Gun off, killing Bellmann. Sally survives and is rescued by Jim and Mackinnon from the rubble. Bellmann's death is reported as a tragic accident; Miss Walsh gets her money and insists in investing it in Garland & Lockhart (the photography firm Sally helped set up); it transpires that Jim will walk with a limp for the rest of his life thanks to his efforts to rescue Sally when his leg was broken; Nellie Budd recovers and decides to go back to the north with Jessie; and Mackinnon and Lady Mary leave England to go to America. In the spring of the next year, Charles shows Sally, Webster and Jim a possible new location for Garland & Lockhart after the fire. It is beautiful and spacious with a large orchard; the only drawback being that it is apparently haunted. They decide to take it and Charles gives Sally a photograph he had taken near the beginning of the novel of Frederick. The novel closes with Sally's announcement that she is pregnant with Frederick's child.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "560_199", "question": "What sport does tight end play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "560_5050", "text": "The tight end (TE) is an offensive position in American football, arena football, and Canadian football. It is a hybrid that combines the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a receiver. As part of the receiver corps, they play inside the flanks (tight), contrasted with the split end who plays outside the flanks (wide). Like offensive linemen, they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers. On the other hand, unlike offensive linemen, they are eligible receivers and potent weapons in a team's offensive schemes. A good tight end is designed to be a mismatch in one of two ways-  due to their larger size to a regular receiver an opposing team may allocate a defensive lineman to block a tight end for run  plays, but that lineman would be unable to keep up with a tight end on a passing play. Conversely, an opposing team may allocate a  smaller and faster safety or cornerback to guard a tight end in case of a pass play, but then that safety will be in danger of being overpowered by the tight end in a run play. \nThe tight end's role in any given offense depends on the preferences and philosophy of the head coach, offensive coordinator, and overall team dynamic. In some systems, the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman, rarely going out for passes. Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver, frequently taking advantage of the tight end's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary. Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in passing situations.\nOffensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "560_5052", "text": "Most tight ends are large in size, with an average height of 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) and a weight exceeding 254 lb (115 kg).

They are also among its heavier players, with only linemen and some linebackers weighing more than averaged-sized tight ends.\nAs a result, tight ends are almost universally slower than wide receivers and running backs, although occasionally one with exceptional speed appears.

The black Petes are not blackened by soot from the chimneys they enter to deliver presents, but as a result of the fire in which they were killed.

Wolfe, the first of many Locus reviewers to discuss the book at time of publication, compares the novel at many points with Willis's Lincoln's Dreams and writes:\n\nApart from its simple virtues as a compelling story on an irresistible theme, Connie Willis's big, ambitious new novel Passage should be of particular interest to her readers because of the ways in which it recapitulates major preoccupations and techniques of her career to date, and because in it she seems fiercely determined to show us everything she's got... Each makes historical research a major vector of narrative suspense, with specific historical details\u2014the Civil War in Lincoln's Dreams, the sinking of the Titanic here\u2014treated as though they were clues in a murder mystery.\nWolfe continues: Like Doomsday Book (1992), it grapples with one of the grandest of all themes, death, and uses the inability of major characters to communicate key bits of information to each other as another suspense device. Like Willis's comic short fiction, it pokes fun at institutional culture\u2014in this case hospitals, with their mazelike architecture and ego-driven politics\u2014and at such ghoulish aspects of pop culture as afterlife gurus like John Edwards\" (i.e., John Edward) \"and self-help manuals for the recently bereaved.\"\nFaren Miller wrote in Locus: \n\nWhile the subject matter and setting of Passage allow Willis to display her characteristically unsentimental poignancy ... she can also poke fun at matters of life and death... The book's multiplying internal and external mazes provide an emblem of human complexity, foolishness, and deeper terrors, some reaching from beyond death. Jonathan Strahan of Locus praises the novel's \"seriousness\", \"clear-eyed humor\" and its \"amusing portrayal of what it's like to be in a big hospital\", which is itself a \"confusing, overwhelming portrait,\" as parts of what it makes \"her most ambitious novel\". He adds, \"At the three-quarter point of Passage, Willis does something that no reviewer should leak but it is much of what makes the book worth reading. What she attempts is to find a way to look at death and life after death in a way that doesn't conflict with matters of faith, but which also is consistent with the fundamentally rational underpinnings of science fiction.\"SciFi.com describes Passage as \"an emotionally exhausting trip\" that is ultimately \"a rewarding experience.\" Laura Miller, writing for Salon, says that \"its construction is a marvel of ingenuity and \u2014 what's even more remarkable, given the wizardry of Willis' storytelling \u2014 its intellectual honesty is impeccable... You won't find the beautiful sentences of more-celebrated 'novelists of ideas' here, though the ideas themselves are far better, more daring and more original, than those chewed over by most literary heavyweights. The dialogue can sound a trifle canned, the minor characters feel a mite thin (not that many novels of ideas don't share these flaws, too), which explains in part why Passage seems to hover between genre and genius. Given how rare a searching intelligence like Willis' is among today's novelists, does it really matter?\"The SF Site review judges that the novel \"starts slowly, and it's too long. Willis' trademark habit of making some set of frustrating everyday-life details a recurring motif or running joke (in this case, the difficulty of navigating the hospital corridors, plus the never-open cafeteria) is over-extended here...\"; conversely, reviewer Steven Wu felt that \"Part One of the book is masterful, with several chilling scenes, a compelling mystery, and a doozy of a cliffhanger ending. But then, only a third of the way through the book, things begin slowing down.\"\nThe A.V. Club's reviewer writes: There's certainly nothing comforting about Passage, which steeps its characters in death of all kinds \u2014 swift and sudden, prolonged and painful. Willis' satirical flair originally has Landry [sic] and Wright running around like The Three Stooges, juggling impossible schedules in an impossible environment and careening amidst exaggeratedly colorful characters in every chapter. A mid-book twist, however, takes the story into darker and more memorable territory, helping turn Passage into a complex, finely crafted, haunting story that makes the light at the end of the tunnel impossible to take lightly.\nA reviewer from Scientific Gems wrote of the novel, \"it is well-written, it has an interesting plot, and it has useful things to say about the nature of science and the nature of medicine. One piece of good advice, for example: 'Joanna says you should only say what you saw, not what anybody else says you should see.'\" [Spoken by Maisie Nellis] \"Indeed, the importance of truth is underscored repeatedly in the book.

This was white with a red breast, and with thin stripes down either side, and was created to accommodate the logo of the club's principal sponsor, Cantor's, a local furniture shop. This was to be replaced by a striped kit, with the sponsor Bentley's (1981\u201382) and Renault (1982\u201383) written vertically down a white stripe over the left-hand side. Their kits continued to feature striped shirts, albeit with various aids to accommodate their sponsors, including a yellow square for Laver from 1988\u201392 (the 1990\u201392 shirt also featured narrow black stripes through each white stripe) and a black hoop, also for Laver in the 1994\u201395 season.

The club also every few seasons opt to put thin black stripes between the red and white stripes. Sheffield United's home colours were the inspiration for the kit of Irish club, Derry City.

They define the area within which the batsmen and bowlers operate. The term crease may refer to any of the lines themselves, particularly the popping crease, or to the region that they demark. Law 7 of the Laws of Cricket governs the size and position of the crease markings, and defines the actual line as the back edge of the width of the marked line on the soil, i.e., the edge nearest to the wicket at that end.\nFour creases (one popping crease, one bowling crease, and two return creases) are drawn at each end of the pitch, around the two sets of stumps. The bowling creases lie 22 yards (66 feet or 20.12 m) apart, and mark the ends of the pitch. For the fielding side, the crease defines whether there is a no-ball because the wicket-keeper has moved in front of the wicket before he is permitted to do so. In addition, historically part of the bowler's back foot in the delivery stride was required to fall behind the bowling crease to avoid a delivery being a no-ball.

Her passengers include her young son Amin (played by Akbari's real life child, Amina Maher), her sister, a bride, a sex worker, and a woman on her way to prayer.\nThe first vignette of the film is a conversation between Amin and his mother, as he is being driven to the local pool. Over the course of their conversation, the driver raises her voice to him and tensions escalate as he yells over her. It is revealed that, due to the limited rights women are given the court system, the driver obtained a divorce from her ex-husband, by falsely telling the court he was a drug addict. After their conversation erupts into a fight, Amin abruptly exits the car.\nThe second vignette features the driver's sister who works as a teacher. They discuss the heavy burden and expectations children place on their parents. Both of their children have accused the women of not being good mothers. They eventually pick up a birthday cake for the driver's husband, Mortaza. The driver's sister advises her regarding Amin's rude behavior and tells her to let Amin live with his father, who will be able to \"set him straight\".\nDuring the third vignette, the driver picks up a pious old woman who goes to the Mausoleum three times a day to pray. She reveals that her husband and 12-year-old son have both died. She goes to the Mausoleum to pray for them. She has sold her possessions in order to go on a pilgrimage to Syria and has given away her other possessions to people who are less fortunate than her. Their conversation ends as the driver drops the old woman off at the Mausoleum after she is unable to convince the driver to go in and pray herself.\nThe fourth vignette starts with a sex worker who mistakes the driver for a male client and gets into her car. The driver continues to drive around with the unnamed woman and persists in asking her personal questions. The sex worker, in turn, ends up lecturing the driver. She tells the driver that many of her clients are married men that get calls from their wives while they are with her. She admits to the driver that she feels bad for women who are idiotic enough to cling onto men and who actually believe that men are truthful. The sex worker was engaged to a man once until she realized she was \"foolish\". The conversation ends as she is dropped off and immediately picked up by a client.\nThe fifth vignette features a woman whose relation to the driver is unclear. The woman is picked up just after she has prayed at the Mausoleum. The two women discuss religion and whether or not they are believers. The passenger confesses that she had not been a believer in the past, and now she is not so sure. The passenger tells the driver that she was supposed to get married and she now prays at the Mausoleum with the hope that the man she is dating will propose soon.\nIn the next vignette, the driver picks up Amin from her ex-husband, who has been taking care of him. She and her ex-husband each stay in their cars, leaving Amin to cross a busy traffic-filled street. The driver asks permission to keep Amin overnight and he eventually agrees. Amin disagrees with his mother over a shortcut to his grandmother's house, but eventually realizes his mother is going the right way. Amin tells his mom that his father has been watching porn at home alone at night.\nThe driver next picks up her crying sister who is distraught over her husband leaving after 7 years together. As she cries, the driver tells her, \"It is wrong to cling to him.\" The driver is reciting almost exactly what the sex worker had told her the night before. The driver is very frank and harsh with her sister. She tells her to toughen up and stop being so weak.\nDuring the eighth vignette, the driver is with Amin again. She says a woman told her that Amin is a man and therefore needs to live and learn from a man. The driver agrees that Amin should go live with his father, and they have a conversation about her ex-husband finding a new wife. Amin says that his new wife would be better than his mother by obeying her husband, doing more housework, and coming home earlier. They disagree again over a shortcut and soon their argument escalates to the point where Amin abruptly gets out of the car again.\nThe ninth vignette features the same woman from the fifth vignette. She tells the driver that her boyfriend does not want to marry her, despite her hopes that he will. She feels jealous over the fact that he is thinking of another woman and that is what hurts her the most. The driver asks her passenger why her veil is so tight, and it is revealed that the passenger has shaved her head.\nThe final vignette is the shortest. The driver picks up Amin from his father.

Demoted to the Northern Premier League the next year, Boston won the Northern Premier League Premier Division play-offs in 2010 and have since had five unsuccessful play-off campaigns in the Conference and National League North.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "560_5168", "text": "The club was founded in 1933 as a successor to a club called Boston Town. Their first game was a 3\u20131 defeat at home to Grimsby Reserves on 26 August 1933, when a crowd of 1,544 watched Boston's no.7, Blessed, score United's first ever goal. They then had a moderate amount of success in various leagues, including the Midland League and Southern League.\nThe club's FA cup run of 1955\u201356 included a 6\u20131 victory at Derby County, then playing in Third Division North, with Geoff Hazledine scoring a hat-trick. This was a record away win by a non-League team against League opponents in the FA Cup. This set up a Third round match against Tottenham Hotspur of the Football League First Division at White Hart Lane on 7 January 1956. The match against Tottenham Hotspur was played in front of a crowd of 46,185. The Pilgrims lost 4\u20130, but the match was more notable for the travelling support. Over 10,000 Boston supporters attended the game. A number of special train services from Boston to King's Cross were set up for the day.\nThey were founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968, of which they were champions four times, and of the Alliance Premier League (now the National League) in 1979. However, their Northern Premier League title wins were not enough to gain them election to the Football League, and when they won the title in 1978 they surprisingly missed out on league status in favour of runners-up Wigan Athletic, who took the Football League place previously held by Southport.\nIn 1985, Boston United went to Wembley for the first and only time in their history for the FA Trophy Final of the 1984\u201385 season, after Bob Lee scored a winning last minute goal in the 2nd leg of the semi-final against Altrincham at York Street to put the Pilgrims through. Boston lost 2\u20131 to Wealdstone in front of 20,775, with Chris Cook scoring United's only goal.\nBoston United finished third in the Conference in 1988\u201389, but were unable to build on this and were relegated to the NPL in 1993. They were transferred to the Southern League, winning the title in 2000, and went fully professional in 2001. In their first season as a professional club, Boston won the Conference and were promoted to the Football League.\nHowever, in the wake of their promotion, Boston's manager, Steve Evans, and former chairman, Pat Malkinson, were charged with breaking the Football Association's rules over the registration of players. Both men received bans from the FA, and the club were fined and docked four points from their first season in the League. This angered some, especially the Conference runners up Dagenham & Redbridge, who believed that any points deduction should have applied to the previous season, which would have meant Dagenham being promoted instead.\nYouth team coach Neil Thompson was appointed as manager for Boston's maiden Football League season, and though they left it late to secure survival, they ultimately managed a creditable 15th-place finish. The following season resulted in another relegation battle, and as soon as former manager Steve Evans had served his suspension in full, Thompson was sacked and Evans was reinstated as manager, leading them to a strong late-season run and an eventual finish of 11th. Evans' return and a substantial investment in the playing squad saw Boston among the promotion favourites for the 2004\u201305 season, but it in fact resulted in a disappointing 16th place. 2005-06 would prove to be their most successful Football League season, with their finish of 11th being their joint-highest, but the club missing out on the play-offs by just five points (having missed out by a much larger margin in 2003\u201304).\n\n The 2006\u201307 season saw Boston struggle all season long, however, and in May 2007, Boston were relegated from Football League Two on the last day of the season. Steve Evans and his assistant Paul Raynor on 27 May resigned from the club, and two days later joined Crawley Town.Because of the relegation Boston were originally scheduled to play the 2007\u201308 season in the Conference National but this position was immediately placed in doubt after the club's chairman Jim Rodwell entered Boston into a Company Voluntary Arrangement late in their last game so that 10 points would then be deducted in the 2006\u201307 season instead of the 2007\u201308 season. Although this meant that Boston started the 2007\u201308 season without a points penalty FA rules dictated that they be demoted 2 divisions as a result of HM Revenue & Customs placing a restriction into the CVA of Boston not being allowed to pay football creditors 100% of what they were owed. They therefore played the 2007\u201308 season in the Conference North division, two steps below the Football League. This would be United's first season under the new ownership of David Newton and Neil Kempster, who took control of the club over from ex-Chairman Jim Rodwell.\nDespite finishing the 2007\u201308 campaign in 10th place under the guidance of Tommy Taylor, United were still in administration by the 2nd Saturday of May in 2008. This meant they were relegated again to the Northern Premier League Premier Division for the 2008\u201309 season. Despite coming out of administration just before the start of the new season anyway, Boston United failed to have this decision overturned. Another result of this was that they would also have to enter the FA Cup in the 1st qualifying round, something which they had not done for many years. They reached the final of the Lincs Senior Shield but were swept aside by Stamford 4\u20131,and finished the league campaign in 16th position.\nA much more favourable campaign the following season saw The Pilgrims finish 3rd in the league where they won the play-offs, beating Bradford Park Avenue in the final thanks to an Anthony Church extra time winner to earn promotion back to the Conference North.\nJoint managers Rob Scott and Paul Hurst resigned from the club in 2011 and were appointed joint managers of Conference National side Grimsby Town. Club chairman David Newton revealed he was beginning legal proceedings against the pair and Grimsby Town, for breach of contract. The Pilgrims wasted no time appointing former Boston player Jason Lee and current player Lee Canoville as joint caretaker managers. With only 7 Conference North games remaining, the pair guided United to a 3rd-place finish in the league setting up a play-off tie against Guiseley. Boston lost the first leg 1\u20130 at Nethermoor Park but fought back in the return leg winning 3\u20132 at the Jakemans Stadium to take the match to extra-time and penalties. Boston went out losing 2\u20133.\nAfter a decent start to the 2012\u201313 season, Boston started to drop off the promotion pace, with a 7-game winless run from November to mid-December not aiding their cause. More inconsistency followed, and Jason Lee was sacked. Graham Drury took over within the same week but left the club after less than 2 months. Dennis Greene took over soon afterwards, but after a good start couldn't help the club from finishing higher than a poor 16th place, just 5 points above the relegation zone.\nThe following season was a marked improvement in both league and cups. Whilst Boston fell at the 2nd hurdle (2\u20130) at Brackley, they made the last 32 of the FA Trophy with wins over Redditch and Southport, before a 2\u20130 loss at Tamworth. In the league, they held on to a top 5 spot for most of the season and never fell below 8th, but they couldn't keep up with late surges by Hednesford and Guiseley, ending 1 place and 6 points off the playoffs in 6th.\nThe following season Boston did make the play-offs however, securing a place with a 4\u20131 victory at Solihull Moors before a 0\u20130 draw at home to relegated Leamington was enough to secure third place. A 0\u20130 draw at Chorley's Victory Park set up a winner takes it all second leg at York St, and goals from Scott Garner and Kaine Felix put Boston 2\u20130 ahead. However, Chorley forced extra time with an overhead kick from Adam Roscoe late in injury time. Despite Roscoe's extra time red card, Boston failed to score a third and the game went to penalties, which United lost after seven spot kicks when Sam Ashton saved Rene Steer's penalty.\nBoston started the 2015\u201316 season as play-off favourites once again, but pressure mounted on Greene due to poor results including losing to Gainsborough in the FA Cup and Solihull Moors in the FA Trophy (both in the first round Boston featured in). However, Boston found spells of form later in the season to ensure 5th place at the expense of Nuneaton- a 3-point deduction received by the Warwickshire side helping the United cause.\nBoston faced North Ferriby United in the play-offs, and won the first leg 2\u20130 at home through Grant Roberts and Zak Mills' goals. The second leg at Church Farm saw that lead overturned by King, Denton and Brooksby as United again missed out. Somewhat of an exodus then occurred as Boston saw Spiess, Mills, Piergianni, Garner, Marrs, Felix and Southwell all depart, Southwell and Mills notably moving to league sides Wycombe and Grimsby respectively.\nThe following season started poorly, manager Greene leaving the club in late November to be replaced by former Mansfield Town manager Adam Murray. He led the side to safety but was himself gone by November the following year. With Boston occupying a relegation spot, Craig Elliott \u2013 leaving Shaw Lane to do so \u2013 took over and guided the Pilgrims to safety, United for a time threatening to break in to the play-offs following victories over title chasing Harrogate and Salford City.\nElliott's second full season in charge was to be the club's last at York Street (2019\u201320). The side won through four away ties in the FA Cup to reach a second round game away to Rochdale. A draw at Spotland secured York Street one last big cup tie \u2013 the League One side winning 2\u20131 in a televised replay with over 4000 in attendance. Newcastle United at home was their reward. The coronavirus pandemic cut short the season and Boston finished third on points-per-game, winning a behind closed doors semi-final against Gateshead 5\u20133 to secure a play-off final with Altrincham. The Robins scored the only goal of the game, the club's last match at York Street.\nWith the new Pilgrim Way stadium delayed due to the pandemic, the 2020\u201321 season, still behind closed doors, started with United playing home games at Gainsborough's Northolme. A covid outbreak in the squad meant only 3 home games were played at Trinity's home, as the Boston Community Stadium opened on 5 December 2020, against Chorley. The season was ended as the coronavirus situation worsened over the winter. 2021\u201322 finally saw United fans able to see a game at the new Pilgrim Way stadium, starting with a 5\u20130 friendly win over Lincoln City in July 2021.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "560_5169", "text": "Boston United played at York Street until 2020, styled as The Jakemans Stadium through a sponsorship deal.

The away fans sat in a section of the York Street Stand.\nFormer club chairman Jon Sotnick claimed it was not up to Football League standards and called for a new ground during the Pilgrims' time in the Football League. Planning applications were made to Boston Borough Council in June 2006, but the council turned down the application. The ground had a total capacity of 6,643.\nThe club built a new stadium outside the town, and on 10 April 2019 announced that the 2019\u201320 season was to be their last at York Street.For the beginning of the 2020\u201321 season, the club were granted permission to use Gainsborough Trinity's Northolme as their home ground temporarily whilst finishing touches were applied to their new stadium.The club played its first game at the Boston Community Stadium on 5 December 2020, resulting in a 2\u20130 home defeat to Chorley in the National League North.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The next year Fr\u00f6s\u00f6 IF also joined the project. The newly formed club started out their existence in the third tier in 1997 and \u00d6stersund/Torvalla FF ceased to exist as a consequence. IFK \u00d6stersund, Ope IF och \u00d6stersund/Torvalla FF (\u00d6TFF). In 2000 a fifth club, F\u00e4ltj\u00e4garnas IF, was also merged into the club.\nDuring the 2000s the club started taking on an English flavour and in 2007 the director of football Daniel Kindberg used his friendship with coaches Roberto Mart\u00ednez and Graeme Jones to start a cooperation with Swansea City where \u00d6stersund would loan young players from the club. Swansea also came over to \u00d6stersund to play the inauguration game at the newly built stadium. After a poor 2010 season the club was relegated to the fourth tier for the first time ever.\nIn 2011 Daniel Kindberg returned to the role as director of football and increased financial backing from local companies which enabled the hiring of more full-time staff. Following Jones' recommendation the club also brought in young English manager Graham Potter who was working at an English university at the time. Through several successful signings, some coming from Potter's connections at Nike Football Academy, the club was able to win both the fourth tier and then the third tier immediately the year after. The club was promoted to Superettan for the 2013 season and finished 10th that season.\nIn January 2014 the club announced that they had signed a half-billion kronor deal with the government of Libya to develop and educate Libyan football players. Under the terms of the deal, \u00d6stersunds FK would train 250 young men from Libya every year, except the first year in which they will receive 60 students. Those players would be taught English and computer skills in addition to sports theory and football training. The deal was expected to raise \u00d6stersund FKs yearly profits by over 50%. The deal with the Libyan state never came to life, thus meaning no students came to \u00d6stersund and no money was received by the club.On 27 October 2015, the club was promoted to Allsvenskan for the first time. In 2017, they managed to win their first major trophy, Svenska Cupen, after defeating IFK Norrk\u00f6ping 4\u20131 in the final, also qualifying for the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League, marking their first appearance in a European competition tournament. In their Europa League debut in the second qualifying round on 13 July 2017, \u00d6stersund earned a shock 2\u20130 victory against Turkish giants Galatasaray at the J\u00e4mtkraft Arena and eliminated them after a 1\u20131 draw in Istanbul. Two goals by Saman Ghoddos in a win against PAOK on 24 August saw them qualify for the group stage at the first time of asking, at the same time making them the only Swedish representative in the season's UEFA competition and making Graham Potter the only British manager in the Europa League group stage. After losing only one game in their campaign, they finished second in a group featuring Athletic Bilbao and Hertha Berlin, becoming the first Swedish club to progress beyond the Europa League group stage. In the round of 32 they managed to beat English side Arsenal 2\u20131 away but were eliminated 4\u20132 on aggregate after losing the first leg 3\u20130.On 17 April 2018, club chairman (also the director of football) Daniel Kindberg was taken into custody by the Swedish Economic Crime Authority, suspected on probable cause of serious fraud and for assisting in serious gross accounting violations. Together with two other people, Kindberg is suspected of submitting false invoices in several companies, according to the prosecutor. Several of these companies have strong ties to \u00d6stersunds FK and the club's sponsorship deals. Several years before, in 2014, Kindberg was subject to criticism when \u00d6stersundshem, the municipal housing company where he was the CEO, became a big sponsor of \u00d6stersunds FK.On 11 June 2018, Graham Potter left \u00d6stersunds FK to take over as manager of Swansea City after eight seasons in charge. \nOn 31 October 2021, they were relegated from Allsvenskan after they lost against Varberg BoIS.

{"id": "560_285", "question": "What sport does Slower ball play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "560_5261", "text": "In the sport of cricket, a slower ball is a slower-than-usual delivery from a fast bowler.   The bowler's intention is to deceive the batsman into playing too early so that he either misses the ball completely or hits it high up in the air to offer an easy catch. It is analogous to a changeup in baseball.\nThe slower ball, also known as the 'Wandi ball' technique was popularised in response to the demands of limited-overs cricket, not only to get wickets but also to slow down the scoring rate, as a slower ball will not carry to the boundary as easily as a normal fast delivery if it is hit square or behind the wicket. It is especially used in the last ten or so overs as variation in speed, in addition to line and length, is the key to preventing a late flurry of runs from the batsmen.\nTo be effective, the slower ball must be directed at or near the stumps in order to force the batsman to play, and the bowler's action must appear entirely normal. There are various tricks that the bowler can employ to slow the ball down:\n\nBowling from the back of the hand, effectively a fast googly\nBowling with split fingers: the fingers are placed either side of the seam of the ball, and the ball is bowled full-length; when done correctly the delivery will appear to be a full toss until it suddenly drops.  A similar technique is used to throw the split-finger fastball in baseball. Sri Lankan Dilhara Fernando holds the ball between the index and middle finger, and just fits it in the webbing between the two. This leads to the delivery of a slow loopy ball\nBowling a knuckleball, where the ball is held on the knuckles of the index and middle fingers. To a batsman, it resembles a stock ball due to it appearing as if the bowler was holding the ball in a regulation manner\nOff cutter: instead of placing the index and middle fingers in the orthodox position together on the seam, the middle finger is moved round the ball slightly and then pulled down as the ball is released.  The ball will tend to \"break\" or \"cut in\" from left to right as it pitches, as it does with off spin bowling. It can be effective to only bowl this ball with a single finger on top and it typically rests to the right hand side of the seam\nLeg cutter: the same as an off cutter except that the fingers go the other way and the ball will tend to cut from right to left.  Harder to keep straight than an off cutter\nPalm ball: the ball is held in the palm instead of the fingers; this can be effective but is hard to disguise\nHolding the ball deeper in the fingers. Typically, quick bowlers hold the ball at their fingertips. Holding the ball deeper within the fingers slows the release of the ball. Brett Lee is an exponent of this method\nReduction in the speed of the action: Can be quite effective as a \"different\" type of change of pace. Effectively you change only the rotation of your arm and retain your action\nCross-seam: This type of slower delivery is also popularly employed by medium pacers wherein the bowler holds the ball across the seam instead of holding it on the seam thereby the pace of delivery is reduced when the ball hits the ground. New Zealand medium pace bowler Gavin Larsen used this effectively in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. This can be coupled with a \"split fingers\" style release to result in a delivery which dips sharply at the end of its trajectory or spits from a pitched-up length\nZero rotation: Using a specific type of grip & release it is possible to impart little or no rotation on the ball. This lack of rotation causes an instability in air pressure, which makes the ball move erratically through the air\nSingle finger: Using a variation on the in-swinger grip where the index finger and thumb are both fully on the seam of the ball and the second finger barely touches it. Less force on the ball at the point of release results in reduced pace\nThumb ball: Bowled using the same grip as a stock delivery, barring the palm position, which is facing up instead of down, so that it looks like a back of the hand grip. This can be an effective delivery, but it is hard to produce", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "560_5262", "text": "Although a slower ball is usually the result when a bowler tries a change of pace, some bowlers have a delivery which is even faster.

Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894\u201395 season), until the move to north London in 1913.Widely referred to as Highbury, Arsenal Stadium was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect Archibald Leitch, and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing. The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new Art Deco West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993\u201394 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators. This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.\nExpansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II listed building and the other three stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time. After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the Emirates Stadium, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury. The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs, and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006\u201307 season. The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around \u00a3100 million. Some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names. The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028, and the airline will be the club's shirt sponsor until at least 2024. From the start of the 2010\u201311 season on, the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank, East Stand, West Stand and Clock end.

The elder Sam Loxton was an electrician who played second grade cricket for Collingwood. The younger Sam started his education at Yarra Park State School, where he learned to bat, using a pine tree in the schoolyard as the stumps; the same tree was used for the same purpose years earlier by Test players Vernon Ransford and Ernie McCormick, and long-serving Victorian batsman Jack Ledward. The family moved to Armadale, and young Loxton attended Armadale Public School before completing his secondary education at Wesley College, Melbourne, an elite private boys\u2019 school. One of his colleagues at Wesley College was Ian Johnson, a future teammate for Victoria and Australia. The boys\u2019 school coach was P. L. Williams, a renowned mentor of teenagers who had earlier coached Ross Gregory and future Test captain Lindsay Hassett. Away from his sporting commitments at school, Loxton played district cricket for Prahran's third grade team when he was just 12. The young cricketer's parents were stalwarts of the club; Sam Sr. was the scorer and served as a transport man, driving the matting and equipment to matches, while Annie made cucumber sandwiches for 25 years\u2014due to the economic difficulties caused by the Great Depression and World War II, meat catering for players was a luxury even at first-class and international matches. The elder Sam was a member of the club committee from 1941 until his death in 1974, and was a vice-president for the last 17 years of his life. At the age of 16, the younger Loxton was selected in the Victorian Cricket Association Colts team that played in the first grade competition in 1937\u201338; he played three seasons with the outfit, which was effectively a state youth team. The squad was coached by Bert Cohen and former Test batsman and captain Jack Ryder, and Loxton credited the latter as the biggest influence on his career, saying\n\nHe was an inspiration so far as I was concerned. He had so much to do with my early grounding. Old Jack never had a drink and never smoked a cigarette in his life and nobody walked so tall as that man. He was my cricket father, no doubt about that at all.\nLoxton improved significantly in his third season with the Colts, scoring his first century and taking 21 wickets, having managed only seven scalps in the two previous summers. In 1940\u201341, aged 19, he moved back to Prahran to play in their first grade team after the Colts were disbanded, and he became more productive over the next few years, taking 46 wickets in one season.Loxton also played Australian rules football, and in 1942, he made his debut in the Victorian Football League (VFL)\u2014the highest tier of competition at the time\u2014playing for St Kilda. One of his teammates was Keith Miller, a future Invincibles colleague. Loxton played as both a forward and a defender, and the pair sometimes played together in attack. The recruit from Prahran played in only six matches in his first year, kicking 15 goals. Debuting in round six, he started his career brightly, kicking five and four goals in his first two matches against Melbourne and Collingwood respectively, helping his team to two victories. However, the goals and victories began to dry up and Loxton managed only six goals and one win in the remaining four matches. St Kilda came second to last and did not make the finals.During World War II, Loxton served with the 2nd Armoured Division. He enlisted on 31 July 1942 at Oakleigh, Victoria and was discharged on 7 November 1945 with the rank of sergeant, having spent most of his time at the division headquarters. The war ended Loxton and Miller's partnership at St Kilda. Miller was deployed to South Australia for training before becoming a fighter pilot in England, while his St Kilda colleague served in a reserve unit in Melbourne, enabling him to continue his football career when granted leave. In 1943, Loxton played in only the last four matches of the season, all of which were lost, kicking seven goals, and St Kilda finished last with a solitary victory from ten games. He managed three goals each against Essendon and South Melbourne but was held goal-less against Melbourne. The following year, Loxton played in all 18 matches and topped St Kilda's goal-kicking aggregates with 52. After making a slow start to the season, aggregating only four goals in the first four matches, including two goal-less outings, he began to score more heavily. The St Kilda forward registered a six-goal haul against Geelong in round eight, helping to secure an away win, and scored 23 goals in the last six matches, including five in each of the last three matches. However, St Kilda won only one of these three matches. Loxton's efforts helped his club to finish ninth out of 12 teams, and he came second in the club Best and Fairest. He played a solitary match in 1945, which St Kilda lost, and went goal-less.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "560_5281", "text": "Samuel John Everett Loxton  (29 March 1921 \u2013 3 December 2011) was an Australian cricketer, footballer and politician. Among these three pursuits, his greatest achievements were attained on the cricket field; he played in 12 Tests for Australia from 1948 to 1951. A right-handed all-rounder, Loxton was part of Don Bradman's Invincibles, who went through the 1948 tour of England undefeated, an unprecedented achievement that has never been matched. As well as being a hard-hitting middle-order batsman, Loxton was a right-arm fast-medium swing bowler who liked to aim at the upper bodies of the opposition, and an outfielder with an accurate and powerful throw. After being dropped from the national team, Loxton represented Victoria for seven more seasons before retiring from first-class cricket. He served as an administrator after his playing days were over and spent 24 years as a Liberal Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. Up until 1946, Loxton also played in the Victorian Football League (VFL) for St Kilda as a forward. In all three arenas, he was known for his energetic approach.\nEducated at Wesley College, Melbourne, Loxton first gained prominence as an Australian rules football player. After debuting in 1942, he played 41 games in the VFL for St Kilda as a forward, kicking a total of 114 goals before retiring at the end of the 1946 season to concentrate on his cricket career. In 1944, he headed St Kilda's goal-kicking aggregate with 52 goals and placed second in the club's Best and Fairest. Loxton served in a tank division during World War II and made his first-class cricket debut in 1946\u201347. He scored 232 not out, which remains a record for any Australian player on his first-class debut. After a strong first season, Loxton was selected to make his Test debut in the final match of the 1947\u201348 home series against India. Australia had already won the series and used the last match to trial their young talent. Loxton seized his opportunity, scoring 80 and taking three wickets, securing himself a position on the 1948 England tour.\nAfter a slow start to the historic campaign, Loxton struck form midway through the English summer and forced his way into the team for the last three Tests. He played a prominent role in the Fourth Test, scoring an aggressive and counterattacking 93 that helped Australia pry the initiative from England; the tourists eventually won the match. In 1949\u201350, Loxton cemented his position in the national team, playing in all five Tests in South Africa and scoring his only century at international level. He remained a regular member of the Test team until a form slump during the 1950\u201351 home season; he was dropped after three Tests against England and never played for Australia again. Loxton continued to play for Victoria in domestic competition until retiring at the end of the 1957\u201358 season.\nA member of the Liberal Party, Loxton entered politics and was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, representing the electoral district of Prahran from 1955 to 1979. During this time, Loxton was also active in cricket administration at club, state and international level. He was a state selector for over two decades, and served at national level for ten years, starting in 1970\u201371. He was also the team manager for Australia's tour of the subcontinent in 1959\u201360, overseeing a successful campaign despite a spate of serious illnesses to personnel. Loxton had to deal with a variety of tumultuous events on and off the field during his tenure, often relating to player misconduct, and retired from cricket administration in 1981 following the underarm incident.\nHe was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1979 Birthday Honours for service to the parliament of Victoria and sport.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "560_5292", "text": "Prior to entering politics, Loxton worked as a bank teller.

Loxton was a commentator on GTV-9 for the Melbourne Summer Olympics held in late 1956, and his co-commentators included American track and field icon Jesse Owens. After leaving parliament, the former politician joined the property developers Ellis, Sallmann and Seward.Loxton served as an administrator with various local groups. He was vice-president of the Victorian School for Deaf Children, president of the Prahran Technical School Council and a member of the Prahran College of Advanced Education Council. With regards to housing and social inclusion issues, he served as a committee member of the Glen Loch Home for the Aged and chairman of the Deakin Co-operative Housing Society.His opinions on contemporary cricket were frequently sought. \"People get a bit worried about me\", he told Cricinfo in 2008, \"Shane Warne's been a fine bowler\u2014no doubt about it, he's done some wonderful things\u2014but Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett, who have better strike-rates per match than Warne and never played against a 2nd XI [a reference to the likes of Bangladesh and Zimbabwe]\u2014they played only against the best\u2014had no rough to bowl at. I never had to bat to a leg-spinner who bowled into the rough outside my leg stump, and I played for a long time.\"Loxton married three times. He divorced his first wife Hilda in February 1952 after a nine-year union that produced no children. The cricketer then wed Caryl Bond, whom he had met during the 1949\u201350 tour of South Africa, and the pair had two sons. Loxton later divorced Bond and wed his third wife Joan Shiels. In 2000, one of his sons and his third wife died on the same day, due to a shark attack in Fiji and drowning in the family swimming pool, respectively. In later life he lived alone and was still mobile despite being almost blind. Loxton died on 3 December 2011.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Lion is/was played by an audience member, while a member of the cast chosen before production acted as an MC that would read the directions for the Lion to follow.  Before the play starts, the cast spends time talking and interacting with the audience at the Courtroom Theatre, and some cast members hand out coloured juggling balls, to be used to pick the Lion from the audience.  An audience member is called upon at the start of the play to choose a colour (red, green, blue or yellow), and the person holding that colour ball is then chosen as the lion.  During the 2nd act (the march to Rome) the remaining balls could be thrown down onto the \"stage\" where each ball would call out a different response.  For instance, if the yellow ball was the Lion, the green ball might pull a story, while the blue or red ball would call for what a cast member is thinking of at that particular time.  During intermission the coloured balls would be handed out again, and then once more be able to be thrown down on the \"stage\" and prompt the actors for other tidbits of information.

Traditional sports in the late 19th century were foot racing, lance throwing, quarterstaff fencing and wrestling, although the Christian missionaries disapproved of these activities.The popular sports in Tuvalu include kilikiti, Te ano, association football, futsal, volleyball, handball, basketball and rugby sevens.

Everything south of the line became the new San Mateo County while everything north of the line became the new consolidated City and County of San Francisco.\nSan Mateo County was officially organized on April 18, 1857, under a bill introduced by Senator T.G.

San Mateo County then annexed part of northern Santa Cruz County in March 1868, including Pescadero and Pigeon Point.Although the formation bill named Redwood City the county seat, a May 1856 election marked by \"unblushing frauds perpetuated on an unorganized and wholly unprotected community by thugs and ballot stuffers from San Francisco\" named Belmont the county seat. The election results were declared illegal and the county government was moved to Redwood City, with land being donated from the original Pulgas Grant for the county government on February 27, 1858. Redwood City's status as county seat was upheld in two successive elections in May 1861 and December 9, 1873, defeating San Mateo and Belmont.

{"id": "560_379", "question": "What sport does Indianapolis 500 play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "560_5518", "text": "The Indianapolis 500 is held annually at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a 2.5-mile (4 km) oval circuit. The track is a rounded rectangle, with four distinct turns of identical dimensions, connected by four straightaways (two long straightaways and two \"short chutes\"). Traditionally, the field consists of 33 starters, aligned in a starting grid of eleven rows of three cars apiece. Drivers race 200 laps, counter-clockwise around the circuit, for a distance of 500 miles (800 km). Since its inception in 1911, the race has always been scheduled on or around Memorial Day. Since 1974, the race has been specifically scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. The Sunday of Memorial Day weekend is widely considered one of the most important days on the motorsports calendar, as it is the day of the Indianapolis 500, the Coca-Cola 600, and (usually) the Monaco Grand Prix. Practice and time trials are held in the two weeks leading up to the race, while miscellaneous preliminary testing is held as early as April.\nThe race is the most prestigious event of the IndyCar calendar, and one of the oldest and most important automobile races. It has been reported to be the largest single-day sporting event in the world. Likewise, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway itself is regarded as the world's largest sporting facility in terms of capacity. The total purse exceeded $13 million in 2011, with over $2.5 million awarded to the winner, making it one of the richest cash prize funds in sports.\nSimilar to NASCAR's Daytona 500, the Indianapolis 500 is typically held early in the IndyCar Series season. That is unique to most sports where major events are usually at the end of the respective season. Currently, the Indy 500 is the sixth event of the 17-race IndyCar schedule. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Indianapolis was often the second or third race of the season, and as late as the 1950s, it was sometimes the first championship event of the year. Due to the high prestige of the Indianapolis 500\u2014rivaling or even surpassing the season championship\u2014it is not uncommon for some teams and drivers to focus heavily on preparing for that race during the early part of the season, and not focus fully on the championship battle until after Indy.\nDue to safety issues such as aquaplaning, the race is not held in wet conditions. In the event of a rain delay, the race will be postponed until rain showers cease, and the track is sufficiently dried. If rain falls during the race itself, officials will halt the race (red flag) and await safe conditions. The officials can end the race and declare the results official if more than half of the scheduled distance (i.e., 101 laps) has been completed. If less than half the distance has been completed, the race must be resumed and achieve at least the 101-lap distance in order to be official. A primary limiting factor is available daylight, as the track does not have lighting. If the race is halted and cannot be resumed before sunset, the resumption will be scheduled for the next possible day.\nThe Indianapolis 500, as well as other IndyCar Series races, does not utilize the green\u2013white\u2013checker finish in case of a late-race yellow. The race can be (and has at times) finished under caution. However, officials may call for a late-race red flag (in lieu of a lengthy yellow) to provide an opportunity for a green-flag finish, an option that was used in 2014, 2019, 2022, and 2023. The circuit lacks lights, therefore lateness can become a factor in the cases of lengthy delays.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "560_5520", "text": "Radio coverage of the race dates back to 1922. The race has been broadcast live on the radio in its entirety by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network since 1953.\nThe Hulmans did not allow live television coverage of the 500 until 1986, largely to maximize gate attendance. The race was briefly televised live in 1949 and 1950 on WFBM-TV (today's WRTV), after which the practice was discontinued. From 1964 to 1970, the race was broadcast live on closed-circuit television in theaters around the country. From 1965 through 1970, a highlighted version of the race was shown on ABC's Wide World of Sports. From 1971 through 1985, an edited same-day, tape delay broadcast of the race was shown in prime time. The race broadcast was edited down to either two or three hours in duration (including commercials).\nFrom 1986 through 2018, ABC televised the race live in its entirety. However, at the request of the Speedway, Indianapolis affiliate WRTV was required to blackout the live broadcast and carry it on tape delay in prime time to encourage local race attendance; WRTV would air the ABC primetime lineup in the afternoon. In 2007 (the first year in which the race was carried under the ESPN on ABC branding), the race was first aired in high-definition. In 2016, the IMS declared a sell-out of race tickets for the 100th running of the event, meaning that WRTV would be allowed to air the race live for the first time since 1950.Under the live coverage arrangement, the Indianapolis affiliate of the network airing the race airs that day's programming in a transposed arrangement, with network primetime programming airing during the race and transmitted to the affiliate in advance (for instance in 2019, WTHR aired the season finale of the NBC primetime series Good Girls at 2 p.m. local time), while the race airs on tape delay in prime time.\nCoverage of time trials on ABC dates back to 1961. ABC covered time trials in various live and in tape-delayed formats from 1961 to 2008 and from 2014 to 2018. ESPN (and later along with ESPN2) carried various portions of time trials from 1987 to 2008. Versus covered time trials from 2009 to 2013. Practice sessions have been streamed live online dating back to at least 2001.In 2019, coverage of the Indianapolis 500 moved to NBC, as part of a new three-year contract that unifies the IndyCar Series' television rights with NBC Sports (the parent division of its current cable partner NBCSN), and replaces the package of five races broadcast by ABC with an eight-race package on NBC. The Indianapolis 500 is one of the eight races; this contract ended ABC's 54-year tenure as broadcaster of the race. WTHR is now the local broadcaster of the race under this contract; the existing blackout policy remains, though speedway officials have left the door open to allowing WTHR to air the race live in the event of a sellout. In contrast with the usual sell-out policy, in 2020, the race aired live on WTHR, as the Speedway ran the first three meetings (NASCAR in July, the Indianapolis 500 in August, and Road to Indy in September) behind closed doors as a result of COVID-19 cases in the state (the third INDYCAR meeting, the October road course races, admitted 10,000 spectators each day). The race was also shown live in 2021 on WTHR due to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's restricted capacity amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. WPBI-TV 16.2 in Lafayette also blacks out live coverage of the race to prevent viewers from the Indianapolis market from trying to view the race in that neighboring market and airs the race in tape delay. The first day of qualifying is no longer broadcast on television, and streamed only on Comcast's OTT service.\nIn 2022, the race was able to be viewed live within Central Indiana and Lafayette; however, it was only available on the Peacock streaming service and was not available live on WTHR or WPBI-DT2.

Gwen (Kristin Lehman) tells them he is late, as is Richmond. Holder calls in a search for Jamie's campaign car. In the parking garage, Gwen tells them that a driver dropped Richmond off at Jamie's grandfather's house. At the house, Jamie finds his grandfather, Ted Wright (Marcel Maillard), talking to Richmond. As Jamie leaves with Richmond, Ted mentions figuring out where Jamie was the night \"that girl got killed\". Jamie brings Richmond back to the office and informs him that Mayor Adams is conceding. After Richmond demands to know what is really going on, Jamie admits he arranged to plant the Indian bones at the waterfront construction site to hurt Adams' campaign. Chief Jackson and Michael Ames helped and, in exchange, Jamie promised that Richmond would approve the construction of a casino on the site. When Richmond asks what happened to Rosie, Jamie admits to an \"accident\".\nIn a flashback to the night of October 5, on the Wapi Casino's tenth floor, Jamie, Ames (Barclay Hope) and Chief Jackson (Claudia Ferri) discuss the Indian bones.

It is a major source of protection for the players, made of metal covered either with a rubber or plastic coating. Early facemasks were made of pure plastic.Details of the face mask may vary according to each player and their needs for their position. For example, the quarterback's face mask in previous years could be just a single horizontal bar, since he has a need to see the entire field; today, quarterbacks, receivers and kickers/punters wear, at minimum, a two-bar facemask. (Single-bar face masks are no longer allowed in most levels, except for players who began using the single bar before the rules were implemented.) Positions such as linemen, however, may have several bars on their face mask, both horizontal and vertical.\nIn the leather helmet era, an early attempt at face protection was the \"executioner\" helmet which covered the nose and much of the face. This helmet literally was a face mask bearing a strong likeness to traditional executioner face masks. Another early attempt in the leather helmet era at face protection was the nose guard. These simply covered the player's nose. In modern times, the term \"nose guard\" describes a player on the interior defensive line, usually aligned opposite the offensive center.  \nFace masks first came into vogue in football during the second half of the 1950s, after the hard-shell plastic helmet became commonplace, and were adopted voluntarily and universally at all levels of gridiron football within one decade. Garo Yepremian was the last NFL player to not wear a face mask, only adopting one partway through the 1966 season. Single bars were initially the only available design, and this evolved over the course of the next several decades into the current cage-like designs, which became the norm at all levels by the early 1980s. Single-bar face masks were officially banned in professional football in 2004, with the remaining players still using them allowed to continue wearing them under a grandfather clause; Scott Player was the last player in professional football to wear the single-bar, finishing his career in 2009.\nInitially, face masks were clear Lucite. They then became brown through the use of a rubber coating, which covered the metal bars; the brown later became a neutral gray, and would remain as such until 1974, when the then-San Diego Chargers, Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs introduced the first colored facemasks to football; the two teams rolled out yellow and white facemasks, respectively. This opened the door to many teams at all levels of football changing the facemask color, but some have retained gray ones since (the Dallas Cowboys and Las Vegas Raiders have never worn a color other than gray).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "560_5571", "text": "The term \"face mask\" in the game is also used to refer to the foul of illegally touching the equipment. In most leagues, tackling or otherwise restraining a player by grabbing the face mask is illegal due to the risk of injury, and the penalty is severe, drawing 15 yards, and also a first down if committed by the defense. In high school, the penalty is only 5 yards if the act was considered to be \"incidental.\"Through the 1961 season in the National Football League, the ball carrier's face mask was allowed to be grabbed, but not others. The rule was changed to apply to all players beginning in 1962.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "560_5629", "text": "In many team sports that involve scoring goals, the goalkeeper (sometimes termed goaltender, netminder, GK, goalie, or keeper) is a designated player charged with directly preventing the opposing team from scoring by blocking or intercepting opposing shots on goal. Such positions exist in bandy, rink bandy, camogie, association football, Gaelic football, international rules football, floorball, handball, hurling, field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, lacrosse, ringette, rinkball, water polo, and shinty, as well as in other sports.\nIn most sports that involve scoring in a net, rules apply to the goalkeeper that do not apply to other players. These rules are often instituted to protect the goalkeeper from being a target for dangerous or even violent actions. This is most apparent in sports such as ice hockey and lacrosse, where goalkeepers are required to wear special equipment like heavy pads and a face mask to protect their bodies from the impact of the playing object (e.g., a ball or puck).\nIn some sports, goalkeepers may have the same rights as other players; in association football, for example, the keeper is allowed to kick the ball just as any other player but may also use their hands to handle the ball in a restricted area. In other sports, goalkeepers may be limited in the actions they are allowed to take or the area of the field or rink where they may be; in the NHL, for example, goalkeepers may not play the puck in the restricted areas behind the net or take the puck across the red line.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Such positions exist in bandy, rink bandy, camogie, association football, Gaelic football, international rules football, floorball, handball, hurling, field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, lacrosse, ringette, rinkball, water polo, and shinty, as well as in other sports.\nIn most sports that involve scoring in a net, rules apply to the goalkeeper that do not apply to other players. These rules are often instituted to protect the goalkeeper from being a target for dangerous or even violent actions. This is most apparent in sports such as ice hockey and lacrosse, where goalkeepers are required to wear special equipment like heavy pads and a face mask to protect their bodies from the impact of the playing object (e.g., a ball or puck).\nIn some sports, goalkeepers may have the same rights as other players; in association football, for example, the keeper is allowed to kick the ball just as any other player but may also use their hands to handle the ball in a restricted area. In other sports, goalkeepers may be limited in the actions they are allowed to take or the area of the field or rink where they may be; in the NHL, for example, goalkeepers may not play the puck in the restricted areas behind the net or take the puck across the red line.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "560_4819", "text": "Kuko\u010d grew up as a youth in Split, Croatia.

At the end of the 19th century, work became sport and people started to celebrate regattas between Cantabrian townships.

He was first selected to play on 16 August 1924 against the Lions when they toured South Africa. This was the first of his 17 consecutive Test appearances for South Africa. Osler played in the other three Tests of the Lions tour, and contributed to South Africa winning three of the four Tests. The only Test of the series the Springboks did not win was their 3\u20133 draw in Port Elizabeth where Osler was temporarily knocked out.The next Springbok (as the South African team is known) series was hosting New Zealand's All Blacks in 1928. The teams had met once before in a Test series, drawn 1\u20131 (with 1 match drawn) in New Zealand in 1921. The first Test was played in Durban and the Springboks won 17\u20130, with Osler scoring a world record 14 points in the match.

He captained the team and played in all four Tests; playing against England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Osler's Springboks became the second South African team, and only second of all time, to win a Grand Slam\u2014a win over all four Home Nations on one tour.

During the series he scored a try, conversion and drop-goal.\nOsler is remembered as a fly-half who played a kicking game; that is, he would often kick for territory rather than run with the ball, or pass to his backs. His accuracy when kicking allowed South African teams he was in to play a forward oriented game, commonly referred to as ten-man rugby.

The latter idea spread across the English-speaking world and remains in place today in most teaching hospitals. Through this system, physicians in training make up much of a teaching hospital's medical staff. The success of his residency system depended, in large part, on its pyramidal structure with many interns, fewer assistant residents and a single chief resident, who originally occupied that position for years. While at Hopkins, Osler established the full-time, sleep-in residency system whereby staff physicians lived in the administration building of the hospital. As established, the residency was open-ended, and long tenure was the rule. Physicians spent as long as seven or eight years as residents, during which time they led a restricted, almost monastic life.\nHe wrote in an essay \"Books and Men\" that \"He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all.\" His best-known saying was \"Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis\", which emphasises the importance of taking a good history.The contribution to medical education of which he was proudest was his idea of clinical clerkship \u2013 having third- and fourth-year students work with patients on the wards. He pioneered the practice of bedside teaching, making rounds with a handful of students, demonstrating what one student referred to as his method of \"incomparably thorough physical examination.\" Soon after arriving in Baltimore, Osler insisted that his medical students attend at bedside early in their training. By their third year they were taking patient histories, performing physicals and doing lab tests examining secretions, blood and excreta.\n\nHe reduced the role of didactic lectures and once said he hoped his tombstone would say only, \"He brought medical students into the wards for bedside teaching.\" He also said, \"I desire no other epitaph \u2026 than the statement that I taught medical students in the wards, as I regard this as by far the most useful and important work I have been called upon to do.\"  Osler fundamentally changed medical teaching in North America, and this influence, helped by a few such as the Dutch internist P. K. Pel, spread to medical schools across the globe.\nOsler was a prolific author and a great collector of books and other material relevant to the history of medicine. He willed his library to the Faculty of Medicine of McGill University where it now forms the nucleus of McGill University's Osler Library of the History of Medicine. Osler was a strong supporter of libraries and served on the library committees at most of the universities at which he taught and was a member of the Board of Curators of the Bodleian Library in Oxford. He was instrumental in founding the Medical Library Association in North America, alongside employee and mentee Marcia Croker Noyes, and served as its second president from 1901 to 1904. In Britain he was the first (and only) president of the Medical Library Association of Great Britain and Ireland and also a president of the Bibliographical Society of London (1913).Osler was a prolific author and public speaker and his public speaking and writing were both done in a clear, lucid style. His most famous work, The Principles and Practice of Medicine quickly became a key text to students and clinicians alike. It continued to be published in many editions until 2001 and was translated into many languages. It is notable in part for supporting the use of bloodletting as recently as 1923. Though his own textbook was a major influence in medicine for many years, Osler described Avicenna as the \"author of the most famous medical textbook ever written\". He noted that Avicenna's Canon of Medicine remained \"a medical bible for a longer time than any other work\". Osler's essays were important guides to physicians. The title of his most famous essay, \"Aequanimitas\", espousing the importance of imperturbability, is the motto on the Osler family crest and is used on the Osler housestaff tie and scarf at Hopkins.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jeremy Boyer, the Blues organist, plays a Glenn Miller arrangement of W. C. Handy's \"St. Louis Blues\" in its entirety before games and a short version at the end of every period, followed by \"When the Saints Go Marching In.\" Boyer also plays the latter song on the organ after Blues goals, with fans replacing the word \"Saints\" with \"Blues.\" On October 1, 2018, it was reported that, for the upcoming season, a new goal song recorded by St. Louis-based band The Urge, \"The Blues Have The Urge,\" would be played after Blues goals, immediately following the traditional organ music.At the end of the national anthem before every home game, the words \"the home of the brave\" are drowned out by fans with \"the home of the Blues.\"Starting in 2014, the team introduced a win song in the form of Pitbull's \"Don't Stop the Party\", but from 2016 to 2018, the win song was \"Song 2\" by Blur after public backlash against using a Pitbull song. Beginning in 2018, the win song has been the aforementioned song recorded by The Urge. However, during the 2019 playoffs, Laura Branigan's \"Gloria\" was played first before The Urge song.The Blues were one of the last teams to add a goal horn, doing so during the 1992\u201393 season at the St. Louis Arena. All of these traditions carried over to the Kiel Center (now known as Enterprise Center) in 1994. After each goal, a bell is rung and each of the goals are counted by the crowd. Since 1990, Ron Baechle, also known as the \"Towel Man\" or \"Towel Guy,\" has celebrated each goal by counting with the bell and throwing a towel into the crowd from section 314.The team also has a long tradition of fan-produced programs, sold outside the arena and providing an often biting, sarcastic, humor-filled alternative to team- and League-produced periodicals. The longest-running fan publication, Game Night Revue, was created by a group of fans in the mold of the Chicago Blackhawks' Blue Line Magazine. It operated for over 10 years, from 1994 to 2005, when its owner decided not to resume the magazine after the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout (one final oversized \"goodbye\" issue was distributed the first two home games of the 2005\u201306 season). After hockey resumed in 2005, a few months after GNR's final issue, a new publication, St. Louis Game Time, was formed by several former GNR staffers.Starting after a couple of players heard \"Gloria\" by Laura Branigan, after their win in Philadelphia on January 3, 2019, the team started to use the song after every home win, and lasted all the way up to their Stanley Cup win. The song has since been retired; the last time they played it was during the raising of the Stanley Cup Championship banner ceremony on October 2, 2019.\nOn February 9, 2019, another tradition was born. During the 3rd Period, The Blues were winning by a large margin against the visiting Nashville Predators. The Enterprise Center was electric and buzzing with excitement with anticipation of the win. Blues Director of Entertainment, Jason Pippi, commented that they played Country Roads by John Denver, \"was a bit of an mistake... because people love to sing along to that song\". The mistake was that play resumed before the chorus was over and the music had to stop. However, despite the music stopping, the loyal Blues fans in attendance continued to sing loudly. It was loud enough, TV cameras picked up the song loud and clear. Fox Sports Midwest color commentator, Darren Pang, exclaimed he \"just loved the crowd, they're singing!\". Country Roads has been played during every Home game since, at approximately the 15:00 minute mark of the 3rd Period, regardless of the current score. Jason Pippi stated \"its just a testament to the passion Blues fans bring each and every night... to the Cup (Stanley Cup) maybe?\" And it did take them to the Stanley Cup. The St. Louis Blues won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history later that season.\nAfter each Home win, the entire St Louis Blues team skates to center ice and in unison, raise their sticks and clap while the goal horn blares, to thank the Blues fans in attendance and watching on TV.

The basic bonus rules remain the same, but the limit for team fouls is six per half. Upon committing the seventh foul of the half, a team is penalized and the opposing team is awarded at least one free throw for any defensive or loose-ball foul, no matter if the foul was shooting or non-shooting (offensive fouls are never awarded free throws in the NCAA). In the case of a non-shooting foul, the opposing player must make the first free throw in order to be awarded a second free throw. This is commonly referred to as \"one-and-one\". (A shooting foul is not subject to this requirement; the player will get all free throw attempts allowed by the rules regardless of the result of the preceding shot.) Beginning with the tenth foul of a half, the fouled team is awarded two free throws on non-shooting fouls regardless of whether the first shot is made (often referred to as the \"double bonus\"). For purposes of bonus, team fouls accrue from the second half on, as all overtimes are extensions of it.Women's college basketball followed men's bonus rules until the 2015\u201316 season, when it adopted FIBA bonus rules: four fouls per period; two free throws on every team foul over four; team fouls accrue from the fourth period on, as all overtimes are extensions of it.The NCAA regularly uses its second-tier tournament for Division I men's teams, the National Invitation Tournament, as a testing ground for experimental rules, and the bonus situation is no exception. The following bonus-related rules have been used in the 2017, 2018, and 2019 editions:\nIn 2017 and 2019, both team foul counts were reset to zero at the 10-minute mark of each half (technically 9:59). In 2018, games were played in quarters, matching current practice in NCAA women's basketball, instead of the halves used in the current NCAA men's rules.\nIn all three tournaments, the team foul limit was four per 10-minute block (either the virtual quarter in 2017 and 2019, or the actual quarter in 2018), identical to the NCAA women's limit for each quarter.\nAlso in all three tournaments, two shots were awarded for all non-shooting defensive or loose-ball fouls upon the fifth team foul in a 10-minute block. This is also identical to the current NCAA women's rule.\nIn 2017 and 2019, each overtime period was considered a separate period for accumulation of team fouls, as in the (W)NBA. The fourth team foul in an overtime period triggered the so-called \"double bonus\".\nIn 2019 only, the (W)NBA rule regarding team fouls in the final 2 minutes of a quarter during regulation, or any overtime period, was adopted between 8:00 and 10:00 and 18:00 and 20:00 of each half, as well as the final 2 minutes of any overtime.On May 15, 2023, the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), which governs high school basketball in the United States, announced that it would adopt the FIBA bonus rules.", "hasanswer": false}]}

From August 18 to September 16, 2020, the Whitecaps would play six matches against fellow Canadian MLS teams Toronto FC and Montreal Impact, that would serve as both regular season matches as well as qualifiers for the 2020 Canadian Championship. The Whitecaps would not qualify for the Canadian Championship, finishing at the bottom of the qualification table with only 6 points from 6 games. From September 19, 2020 until the end of the season, the Whitecaps would play the rest of their home matches at Providence Park in Portland, Oregon. They would finish the season with 27 points from 23 matches played, missing the playoffs for the third season in a row.\n2021 saw much greater success for the Whitecaps. The season did not start off well initially, with head coach Marc Dos Santos being relieved of his duties on August 27, 2021 as a result of his team sitting below the playoff line after 20 games, as well as once again getting eliminated by Pacific FC in the 2021 Canadian Championship. However, under interim head coach Vanni Sartini, the team would go unbeaten in 12 of their last 14 games to finish the season, making the playoffs for the first time in four years. In the playoffs, the Whitecaps were eliminated in the first round by Sporting Kansas City, losing by a scoreline of 3-1. On November 30, 2021, Vanni Sartini was named as the club's new head coach.\nIn 2022, the Whitecaps would go on to have mixed success. They missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five years, finishing the season with 43 points. However, they won the 2022 Canadian Championship, beating Toronto FC 5-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw following regulation and extra time. It was the first time that the Whitecaps won the Canadian Championship since their first victory in 2015. The Canadian Championship victory also meant that the Whitecaps would qualify for the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League.\nIn the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League, the Whitecaps defeated Real C.D. Espa\u00f1a to advance to the quarterfinals, but were ultimately eliminated by Los Angeles FC. In the regular season, the team would finish with 48 points, qualifying for the playoffs. They were once again eliminated by Los Angeles FC. In 2023 Leagues Cup, their inaugural appearance in the competition, the Whitecaps advanced to the Round of 32, but were eliminated by Tigres UANL. For the second consecutive season, the Whitecaps won the Canadian Championship for the third time, beating CF Montr\u00e9al 2-1 in the final. As a result, they qualified for the 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup.\nThe 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup saw the Whitecaps face Tigres UANL, a team that the Whitecaps previously lost to 4-1 on aggregate in the 2016-17 edition. The Whitecaps would once again get eliminated by the Liga MX side, by the same 4-1 aggregate scoreline.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 2012, she opposed proposed same-sex marriage reforms. Court has been criticised for such statements by gay tennis players Billie Jean King, Rennae Stubbs and Martina Navratilova, and in 2012, an LGBT rights protest group called for the renaming of Margaret Court Arena.Court was criticised in May 2017 after writing a letter to The West Australian decrying Qantas, the largest airline in Australia, for being a corporate supporter of same-sex marriage and saying that she would boycott the airline. The letter, and further follow-up interviews, again led to calls from some Australians and tennis players to rename the Margaret Court Arena. Some politicians, including Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, rejected calls for the change of name, saying the name celebrates Margaret Court as a tennis player.In June 2017, Russell Jackson wrote that Court had always held controversial views, which he described as \"stubbornly immovable\", citing her support for apartheid in 1970 (\"South Africans have this thing better organised than any other country, particularly America\") and her criticisms of Navratilova in 1990 (\"a great player but I'd like someone at the top who the younger players can look up to. It's very sad for children to be exposed to homosexuality\") as examples. He suggested that this and the similar incident from 2012 are calculated provocations, allowing Court to portray herself as the victim and use the publicity to her advantage, and show that \"for better or worse, Court is now the principal architect of her own image\".On 23 January 2019, Anna Wintour, in her keynote address for the Australian Open's Inspirational Series, renewed calls for the arena's renaming. Court responded by saying she was \"disappointed\" that someone \"coming from America\" was \"unable to tolerate views that were not in line with her own\" and \"[is] telling us in this nation what to do\". Later in the year, Court called on Tennis Australia to honour her and the 50th anniversary of her 1970 Grand Slam in the same way as it honoured Rod Laver earlier in 2019, arguing that the organisation should disregard her views on same-sex marriage, as her tennis achievements are from \"a different phase of my life from where I am now and if we are not big enough as a nation and a game to face those challenges there is something wrong.\" Tennis Australia issued a statement that it \"recognises the tennis achievements of Margaret Court, although her views do not align with our values of equality, diversity and inclusion\" and said that it is \"in the process of working through\" how Court's milestone might be included at the 2020 Australian Open. During the tournament, however, high-profile guests Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe paraded a banner calling for the Margaret Court Arena to be renamed in honour of four-time Australian Open champion Evonne Goolagong.In 2020, her Margaret Court Community Outreach charity was denied a Lotterywest grant for a freezer truck on the basis of her public statements on gay people.

In 1960, aged 17, she won the first of seven consecutive Australian Open singles titles. She completed the career Grand Slam in singles aged 21 with her victory at Wimbledon in 1963. Taking a brief hiatus in 1966 and 1967, Court played as an amateur until the advent of the Open Era in 1968. She completed the Grand Slam by winning all four major singles titles in 1970, part of a record six consecutive major singles victories.

Court is also one of only six tennis players to win a double career Grand Slam in two disciplines, matching Roy Emerson, Martina Navratilova, Frank Sedgman, Doris Hart, and Serena Williams. She also won the Fed Cup with Australia on four occasions. The International Tennis Hall of Fame states \"For sheer strength of performance and accomplishment there has never been a tennis player to match (her).\" In 2010, the Herald Sun called her the greatest female tennis player of all time, a view supported by Evonne Goolagong Cawley.Having grown up as a Roman Catholic, Court became associated with Pentecostalism in the 1970s and became a Christian minister in that tradition in 1991.

The ABL began league competition in the Fall of 1996, while the WNBA launched its first game in June 1997. Both organizations came into existence during a surge in popularity for women's basketball in the United States that followed the perfect 35\u20130 national championship season for the Connecticut Huskies in 1995 and the undefeated, gold medal-winning performance of the United States Women's basketball team at the 1996 Summer Olympics.\nThe ABL lasted two full seasons: 1996\u201397 and 1997\u201398.

Jonnie played guard for West's college team, the West Virginia Mountaineers and married professional golfer Michelle Wie in 2019.As a person, West was often described as an introverted and nervous character, but who also drew the highest praise for his uncompromising work ethic. Regarding his shyness, WVU roommate Jody Gardner testified that West never dated in his entire freshman year, and Lakers coach Fred Schaus once recalled two weeks when his guard never said a word. Apart from being shy, West was always restless: Schaus described him as a \"bundle of nerves\", Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy as \"always on the move\", and fellow Laker and Mountaineer Rod Hundley testified that during bar visits, West would quickly squirm and demand to go elsewhere before everybody else had settled.

After a big loss, the Wests would drive home and she would try to console him, but West would say \"get out\" at the home porch and drive away\u2014an experience that \"killed\" her as a wife.Early in his career, West's West Virginian roots made him a target for some mild jeering. He spoke with a high pitched voice that became even shriller when he became excited so that Lakers captain Elgin Baylor dubbed West \"Tweety Bird\". His Appalachian accent was so thick that one coach interrupted him and asked him to speak English. Baylor once commented: \"Rumors are safe with you, Tweety Bird. You pass them on, but nobody can understand you.\"West was also regarded for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic. The NBA described West as \"obsessive perfectionism, unabashed confidence, and an uncompromising will to win... a level of intensity so high it could melt lead\". Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said: \"He took a loss harder than any player I've ever known. He would sit by himself and stare into space. A loss just ripped his guts out.\" Even before his sole championship in 1972, the Lakers held a \"Jerry West Night\", and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said: \"Jerry, you are, in every sense of the word, truly a champion... If I could have one wish granted, it would be that you would always be happy.\"In 2011, West and bestselling author Jonathan Coleman wrote a memoir entitled West by West: My Charmed, Tormented Life.

Lucina agrees to marry him if he swears that he has been virtuous. Winfield, a man of the world, refuses to take a false oath; in so doing, he paradoxically proves himself honest.

He, overhearing their conversation, tells them he loves them equally and leaves them to decide the issue between themselves. In his absence, Lamont and Travers, two of Lucina's rejected suitors, enter and court Honoria and Rosamund.

In the Round of 16, at home once more, Melbourne Knights lost 3\u20131 to Green Gully in front of 2,472 fans.\nAfter a disappointing first half of the 2017 season, head coach Andrew Marth and assistant Frank Juri\u0107 were relieved of their coaching duties with the club languishing in third-bottom place and out of the FFA Cup in the qualifying stages, losing to NPL Victoria 2 side Dandenong City. Former Port Melbourne coach Eric Vassiliadis was announced as the new head coach on 21 May 2017. Vassiliadis lasted just 35 days in the role before he was relieved of his duties, gaining one point in five matches in his time as head coach. Croatia finished in 12th place with 24 points, its lowest points total since returning to Victorian state football in 2005. The 12th-place finish meant Knights had to play in the promotion-relegation playoff match, coming up against fellow Croatian-backed side Dandenong City for the second time that season. A Kym Harris hat-trick secured a 3\u20132 win for Melbourne Knights on the day and survival in the NPL Victoria.In the post-season, a change in board saw a change in senior team management, with Knights securing former Croatian international Aljo\u0161a Asanovi\u0107 as the head coach, with Dean Ra\u010dunica his assistant. The appointment of Asanovi\u0107, a World Cup bronze medal winner in 1998, and Ra\u010dunica, was hailed as arguable the biggest coaching coup in the history of the NPL Victoria. Uskok also returned to the club. Knights finished the 2018 National Premier Leagues Victoria season in ninth place, four points adrift of a finals spot. Marijan Cvitkovic, Nate Foster and Uskok all finished the season with eight goals. Croatia won the 2018 Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament, hosted by Gold Coast Knights, beating North Geelong 3\u20130 in the final. After the conclusion of the season, Asanovi\u0107 and Ra\u010dunica departed the club to take up an opportunity in Saudi Arabia, joining Slaven Bili\u0107 at Al-Ittihad.The club promoted Micky Colina, the club's u20s coach, to take over the senior head manager role for 2019. On 25 May 2019, the club announced that it had parted ways with Micky Colina as head coach of the first team along with his assistant Steve Gojevic. Marijan Cvitkovi\u0107 was appointed as player-coach for the remainder of the 2019 season. Knights qualified for the 2019 FFA Cup, managing impressive wins over league-leaders Avondale FC and old foes South Melbourne in the qualifying stages. Melbourne Knights were drawn against A-League side Adelaide United FC in the Round of 32, ultimately going down 5\u20132 in the clash played in front of 4,078 fans at Knights Stadium. 4 days later, a second cup run came to an end for the Knights, losing 1\u20130 to Hume City in the 2019 Dockerty Cup final.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "560_5971", "text": "The NSL was disbanded in 2004 to make way for a new professional league, the A-League. The Melbourne Knights knowing they would not be part of this new league, opted not to bid for a spot in the A-League unlike the other ethnic clubs. The club dropped back to the state league, now called the Victorian Premier League. But the Knights along with South Melbourne FC were not allowed to enter the 2004 VPL season, with various clubs in a campaign led by former Socceroo and JUST player Ernie Tapai at Whittlesea blocking their entry. This was despite assurances from the majority of the VPL clubs prior to the vote that they would vote in support of the entry of the Melbourne Knights into the league.\nThe Knights went to the president of the new Football Federation Australia, Frank Lowy, for help. The club was told by Lowy that he and his organisation were powerless to do anything the help resolve the issue. As a consequence the club went over 12 months with no football and no source of revenue. This placed the club on the brink of financial ruin, so much so that the club was close to selling its stadium. The 12-month in-action also saw the club lose its entire squad on free transfers, including 3 players that went on to join A-League club Melbourne Victory (Daniel Piorkowski, Steve Pantelidis and Adrian Leijer). The club has never been compensated for these losses.\nFor the 2005 VPL season the club finally resumed its football. The Knights had to re-build a squad, creating a difficult first few seasons in the VPL. 2005 saw mixed results for the club as they finished 9th, at one stage challenging for a finals spot before falling away.\nThe 2006 season was disastrous. The side started off brilliantly, leading the competition in the early stages. Then the club was hit by crisis after crisis; board interference in player selection, three coaching changes and a player walkout, which nearly saw the club relegated. On a positive note there was the unearthing of an exciting new talent, Mate Dugand\u017ei\u0107. He made his debut in the senior side at only 16 years of age making an impressive impact.\n2007 was the year that saw a turnaround in the fortunes of the Melbourne Knights. Chris Taylor was appointed coach and strong recruiting by the club, including the signing of former NSL stars Steve Iosifidis and Joe Spiteri, saw the club go into the season with high hopes. Despite this it was a mixed start to the season for the club, only winning 2 of its opening 8 games. Soon after the club made 3 key signings; former Knights NSL player Anthony Pelikan from Oakleigh, 2006 under 21 VPL player of the year Daniel Visevic from Richmond and up-and-coming player Cameron Watson who had spent time at Portugal's FC Porto. These signings saw the club storm home, winning 7 of its final 9 matches and finishing second on the ladder, a point behind the Preston Lions.\nIn the finals the club lost to Preston, 1\u20130, in a tightly fought affair with Preston scoring the winner late in the game. The Knights then took on Oakleigh to keep their title hopes alive.  The club proved their class with a strong 1\u20130 win. Finally the Melbourne Knights once more faced off against Preston, this time for a spot in the Grand Final against Whittlesea. The club lost 2\u20131 in a controversial match at Bob Jane Stadium. Anthony Pelikan was sent off just before half time, receiving a second yellow card for simulation. The Knights put on a brave performance in the second half. But a late strike from Preston against the run of play killed the game off despite a consolation goal deep in injury time. Overall it was a successful year for the club, finishing 3rd in what was the club's highest league finish in well over a decade. Also the club went on to win the under 21 and under 18 Victorian titles.\n2008 season saw the club aim high once more. There were a number of changes in the squad, with Mate Dugandzic and Daniel Visevic being signed by Croatia's Dinamo Zagreb, and influential goalkeeper Adrian Cagalj transferring to Oakleigh. Players brought into the club included the return of Andrew Barisic from a year stint in Germany.\nA stellar start to the season saw the Knights go on a club record in the state league with a 19 match unbeaten streak, seeing the club lead the league for a large part of the season. But injuries late in the campaign took their toll bringing the unbeaten streak to an end, with the side's midfield being decimated by the loss of Anthony Pelikan, Ivan Franjic and Cameron Watson, as well as the early season injury of influential captain Tom Milardovic. Eventually the Knights finished second just a point behind Minor Premiers Green Gully.\nIn the opening game of the finals the Knights took on Green Gully. The match ended 1-1 after extra time with the Knights taking out the match on penalties. Knights then took on the Altona Magic for a spot in the Grand Final. The match at Knights Stadium once more saw the game finish 1-1 and go to penalties. But it was Altona that took it out 4\u20133. Knights with a second chance at a Grand Final spot took on Heidelberg United, the Knights proved too strong winning 2\u20131. The Grand Final, the club's first in 12 years, took place at Bob Jane Stadium in front of 5,500 mostly Knights fans. The club went into the match still missing influential players Franjic and Pelikan, as well as striker Joe Spiteri missing the game due to suspension. It was a game that the Knights dominated, creating many chances but failing to convert them. The match finished 0-0 after 90 minutes and moved into extra match. With the match poised to go to penalties Altona snatched victory with barely a minute left in the match. One piece of consolation came with captain Craig Elvin winning the Jimmy Rooney man of the match award. Also striker Andrew Barisic had a stellar season scoring 19 goals, the most by a Knights player since Mark Viduka in 1994/95.\nThe 2009 VPL season started with a mass exodus of players, this most notably included Andrew Barisic to new A-League franchise Gold Coast United, as well as veterans Joe Spiteri and Steve Iosifidis dropping to lowers leagues to finish off their careers. A number of new recruits were brought in, with a strong focus on youth, which saw players brought from the reserves into the senior squad and a handful of players from the Melbourne Victory FC Youth team. The side was strengthened with the signings of a few more experienced players, such as Mate Dugandzic who returned from his stint in Croatia. The first half of the season was disastrous for the Knights, picking up 11 points from just as many matches as they sat third from bottom. The second half of the season saw a marked improvement from the club, as they came within throwing distance of the top 5 only to fall away late in the season.\nThe 2010 season will best be remembered for activities off the field which saw the monumental return of the Grb to the Melbourne Knights emblem after an absence of almost 15 years, with the club reverting to the emblem proudly worn during its back-to-back NSL championships of the mid 90s. The return to the classic emblem was most fitting as the club celebrated the 15th anniversary of those championships, gathering all of the players from that legendary side (except Josip Simunic who was with the Croatia national team) for a successful gala night and reunion match.\nOn the field the 2010 VPL season proved to be an unsuccessful one. The year began with a complete clean out of players; only 3 players remained from the 2009 squad. The club had not seen such a clean out since it dropped out of the NSL in 2004. The task of re-building the side fell to former Knights player Ivan Duzel who took over from Chris Taylor as coach. What was implemented was a recruitment policy that saw a diverse range of players brought to the Knights, including imports such as the American-Croat Tomislav Skara, Englishman Kevin Townson and Frenchman Jean-Charles Dubois. Also there was the return of club legend Danny Tiatto, returning to finish off his career at the Knights.\nThe season itself was marred by inconsistency from the Knights as the club struggled and found itself near the bottom of the table for most of the season. With only 3 matches remaining the club was on the brink of relegation as it sat inside the bottom two. But the Knights ensured their placed in the VPL as it recorded its two most important victories of the season, defeating Bentleigh Greens 2\u20130 away and a 4\u20132 victory at home against Northcote City. After the season the club won a number of individual awards with Kevin Townson awarded the media voted Player of the Year award, while finishing runner-up for the Gold Medal VPL Player of the Year award. Adrian Zahra won the Under 21 Player of the Year award, soon after he was signed by A-League club Melbourne Heart. The post-season gave some cause for celebration as the club took out the Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament in New Zealand, only the second time the club had won the cup.In early 2011, the Knights took out the Victorian Croatian Cup, after defeating North Geelong Warriors FC 4\u20130 in the final. Around 800 people were in attendance, with fundraising actions in place to help sister club Rocklea United after their clubrooms were flooded in Queensland.\nAfter a disappointing start to the 2011 VPL season, assistant coach Paul Magdic took over the head job, replacing Ivan Duzel who had been asked to step down. The tough season ended with a bitterly disappointing 10th-placed finish. Some relief was found in the Knights' Mirabella Cup run, where the club dispatched the likes of Oakleigh Cannons FC and Green Gully SC on their way to the final, but lost 2\u20130 at Melbourne's AAMI Park to Northcote City FC. The Knights confirmed back to back Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament titles in October 2011, as the 37th edition of the event was held at Kralj Tomislav in Sydney.\nThe club relieved Paul Magdic of his duties as head manager in mid-2012, replacing him with club legends Andrew Marth and Frank Juric, the former taking the head role and the latter the assistant's role. Marth led the club on a mini-revival, taking the Knights away from relegation but not enough to book a finals berth.\nThe Melbourne Knights officially launched a sports gym on 3 March 2013. The newly constructed gym, located behind the Mark Viduka stand at Knights Stadium, is a fully equipped boxing, weight and cardio facility.\nThe 2013 season was a welcome change for the Knights, finishing in second place in the regular season, but went down initially to Bentleigh Greens SC in the qualifying final and then to bitter rivals South Melbourne 1\u20130 in the semi-final. The South Melbourne derby was played in-front of 5,000 supporters at Knights Stadium. The bumper crowd was the result of the match falling in the middle of the Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament hosted by the Knights.
