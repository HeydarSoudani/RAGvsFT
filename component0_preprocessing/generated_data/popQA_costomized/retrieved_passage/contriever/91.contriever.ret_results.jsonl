At 24, Ilona released her first studio album, entitled Desde Mi Ventana (\"From My Window\"), produced by Cachorro L\u00f3pez, gaining momentum, and receiving a Latin Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist. Her debut album sold 15,000 units in Colombia earning the singer a Gold album certification. Ilona caught the attention of Argentine musician Le\u00f3n Gieco and agreed to do a duet with her on the song \"En La Zona\". English boy band Blue also recorded with Ilona the song \"One Love\".In 2004, Colombian singer Soraya, during her promotional tour in Chile, sponsored Ilona, who was visiting the country on a promotional plan on radio stations and newspapers. Upon learning of her presence in Chile, Soraya invited her as the opening act of her concert at the Teatro Providencia. Three years later, Ilona released her second album, All\u00e1 En El Sur, a 'rock' focused album produced by Benny Faccone. The album was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the 8th Latin Grammy Awards, losing to Yo Canto by Italian performer Laura Pausini.

Gameplay is viewed from a 2.5D perspective and is similar to previous Kirby titles; the player traverses levels and obtains powers by eating enemies. Kirby 64 introduces Power Combos, the ability to mix powers to create more powerful ones. In a multiplayer mode, up to four players can compete in three minigames.\nDevelopment began in September 1997.

HAL initially planned to use the N64 controller's analog stick for Kirby 64, but switched to the D-pad about a year before release.\nThe game received mainly positive reviews, with praise directed at its colorful visuals and classic style of gameplay, but criticism towards its underwhelming low difficulty and short length. The game was rereleased for the Virtual Console on the Wii in 2008, Wii U in 2015, and the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2022.

Red and Blue were ranked first and called Nintendo's \"secret weapon\" when the games were brought out for the Game Boy in the late 1990s. The game's success revitalized the Game Boy in the late 1990s. Nintendo Power listed the Red and Blue versions together as the third best video game for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color, stating that something about the games kept them playing until they caught every Pok\u00e9mon. Game Informer's Ben Reeves called them (along with Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal) the second best Game Boy games and stated that it had more depth than it appeared. Official Nintendo Magazine named the games one of the best Nintendo games of all time, placing 52nd on their list of the top 100 games. Red and Blue made number 72 on IGN's \"Top 100 Games of All Time\" in 2003, in which the reviewers noted that the pair of games \"started a revolution\" and praised the deep game design and complex strategy, as well the option to trade between other games. Two years later, it climbed the ranks to number 70 in the updated list, with the games' legacy again noted to have inspired multiple video game sequels, movies, television shows, and other merchandise, strongly rooting it in popular culture. In 2019, PC Magazine included the games on their \"The 10 Best Game Boy Games\". In 2023, Time Extension included the game on their \"Best JRPGs of All Time\" list. In 2007, Red and Blue were ranked at number 37 on the list, and the reviewers remarked at the games' longevity:\n\nFor everything that has come in the decade since, it all started right here with Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue''. Its unique blend of exploration, training, battling and trading created a game that was far more in-depth than it first appeared and one that actually forced the player to socialize with others in order to truly experience all that it had to offer. The game is long, engrossing and sparkles with that intangible addictiveness that only the best titles are able to capture. Say what you will about the game, but few gaming franchises can claim to be this popular ten years after they first hit store shelves.\nThe games are widely credited with starting and helping pave the way for the successful multibillion-dollar series. Five years after Red and Blue's initial release, Nintendo celebrated its \"Pok\u00e9monniversary\". George Harrison, the senior vice president of marketing and corporate communications of Nintendo of America, stated that \"those precious gems [Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue] have evolved into Ruby and Sapphire. The release of Pok\u00e9mon Pinball kicks off a line of great new Pok\u00e9mon adventures that will be introduced in the coming months\". The series has since sold over 300 million games, all accredited to the enormous success of the original Red and Blue versions.On February 12, 2014, an anonymous Australian programmer launched Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon, a \"social experiment\" on the video streaming website Twitch. The project was a crowdsourced attempt to play a modified version of Pok\u00e9mon Red by typing commands into the channel's chat log, with an average of 50,000 viewers participating at the same time. The result was compared to \"watching a car crash in slow motion\". The game was completed on March 1, 2014, boasting 390 hours of multi-user controlled non-stop gameplay.In 2017, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

He spent most of his life in Italy, and is one of the earliest important artists, apart from his contemporaries in Dutch Golden Age painting, to concentrate on landscape painting.  His landscapes are usually turned into the more prestigious genre of history paintings by the addition of a few small figures, typically representing a scene from the Bible or classical mythology.\nBy the end of the 1630s he was established as the leading landscapist in Italy, and enjoyed large fees for his work. His landscapes gradually became larger, but with fewer figures, more carefully painted, and produced at a lower rate. He was not generally an innovator in landscape painting, except in introducing the sun and streaming sunlight into many paintings, which had been rare before.  He is now thought of as a French painter, but was born in the independent Duchy of Lorraine, and almost all his painting was done in Italy; before the late 19th century he was regarded as a painter of the \"Roman School\". His patrons were also mostly Italian, but after his death he became very popular with English collectors, and the UK retains a high proportion of his works.\nHe was a prolific creator of drawings in pen and very often monochrome watercolour \"wash\", usually brown but sometimes grey. Chalk is sometimes used for under-drawing, and white highlighting in various media may be employed, much less often other colours such as pink.  These fall into three fairly distinct groups. Firstly there are large numbers of sketches, mostly of landscapes, and apparently very often done at the scene; these have been greatly admired, and influenced other artists. Then there are studies for paintings, of various degrees of finish, many clearly done before or during the process of painting, but others perhaps after that was complete. This was certainly the case for the last group, the 195 drawings recording finished paintings collected in his Liber Veritatis (now in the British Museum). He produced over 40 etchings, often simplified versions of paintings, mainly before 1642.  These served various purposes for him, but are now regarded as much less important than his drawings. He painted frescoes in his early career, which played an important part in making his reputation, but are now nearly all lost.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The only individual who can bend all four elements, the \"Avatar\", is responsible for maintaining harmony among the world's four nations, and serves as the link between the physical world and the spirit world. The series is centered around the journey of twelve-year-old Aang, the current Avatar and last survivor of his nation, the Air Nomads, along with his friends Katara, Sokka, and Toph, as they strive to end the Fire Nation's war against the other nations and defeat Fire Lord Ozai before he conquers the world.

Avatar is presented in a style that combines anime with American cartoons and relies on the imagery of primarily Chinese culture, with various other influences from different East Asian, Southeast Asian, South Asian, North Asian, and Native American cultures.\nAvatar: The Last Airbender was a ratings success and received acclaim from critics for its characters, cultural references, art direction, voice acting, soundtrack, humor, and themes. These include concepts rarely touched on in youth entertainment, including war, genocide, imperialism, totalitarianism, indoctrination and free choice. It won five Annie Awards, a Genesis Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Kids' Choice Award, and a Peabody Award.

Their success continued with Focus 3 (1972) and Hamburger Concerto (1974), the former containing their second hit single, \"Sylvia\". After recording two albums with various musicians, including guitarist Phillip Catherine, singer P. J. Proby, and drummers Colin Allen, David Kemper, and Steve Smith, Focus dissolved in 1978.

Outside Japan, the game was published by Maxis and branded as part of their Sim series. Ports for Sega Saturn and 3DO were released in 1996. A sequel titled The Tower II was released in 1998 and called Yoot Tower outside Japan.\nThe game allows players to build and manage a tower and decide what facilities to place in it, in order to ultimately build a five-star tower. Random events take place during play, such as terrorist acts that the player must respond to immediately.\nCritical reception towards the game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature and its ability to immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Initially envisioned as a solo project by musician John Balance (of the band Psychic TV), Coil evolved into a full-time project with the addition of his partner and Psychic TV bandmate Peter Christopherson (formerly of pioneering industrial music group Throbbing Gristle). Coil's work explored themes related to the occult, sexuality, alchemy, and drugs while influencing genres such as gothic rock, neofolk and dark ambient. AllMusic called the group \"one of the most beloved, mythologized groups to emerge from the British post-industrial scene.\"After the release of their 1984 debut EP How to Destroy Angels, Coil joined Some Bizzare Records, through which they released two full-length albums, Scatology (1985) and Horse Rotorvator (1986). In 1985, the group began working on a series of soundtracks, among them the rejected score for the first Hellraiser film. After departing from Some Bizzare, Coil established their own record label, Threshold House, through which they produced and released Love's Secret Domain (1991). Financial difficulties slowed the group's work in the early 1990s before they returned to the project on releases such as Astral Disaster (1999), and the Musick to Play in the Dark series  composed of Vol. 1 (1999) and Vol. 2 (2000), as well as releasing several projects under aliases such as Black Light District, ELpH, and Time Machines.Balance and Christopherson were the only constant members; other contributors throughout the band's career included Stephen Thrower, Danny Hyde, Drew McDowall, William Breeze, Thighpaulsandra and Ossian Brown. With involvement from these members, the group also started several smaller independent vanity labels, including Eskaton and Chalice. The group's first live performance in 16 years occurred in 1999, and began a series of mini-tours that would last until 2004. Following the accidental death of John Balance on 13 November 2004, Christopherson formally announced that Coil as a creative entity had ceased to exist, ending the Coil discography with The Ape of Naples (2005).

A Cinderella story in which the heroine stands outside the traditional economic structures of English society and ends up wealthy and happy, the novel is a fantasy. At the same time, it criticises the traditional marriage arrangements of the 18th century, which allowed women little choice and prioritised the needs of the family. Smith's criticisms of marriage stemmed from her personal experience and several of the secondary characters are thinly veiled depictions of her family, a technique which both intrigued and repelled contemporary readers.\nEmmeline comments on the 18th-century novel tradition, presenting reinterpretations of scenes from famous earlier works, such as Samuel Richardson's Clarissa (1747\u201348). Moreover, the novel extends and develops the tradition of Gothic fiction. In combination with this, Smith's style marks her as an early Romantic. Her characters learn about their identities from nature and her landscape descriptions are imbued with political messages about gender relations.\nSmith had separated from her husband in 1787 and was forced to write to support herself and her children. She quickly began writing novels, which were profitable at the time. Emmeline was published a year later in 1788; the first edition sold out quickly. Smith's novel was so successful that her publisher paid her more than he had initially promised. The novel was printed in the United States, translated into French, and issued several times during the 19th century.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The recipient of numerous awards and nominations, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation. He was known for his flamboyant, androgynous persona; his wide vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams; and his skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most of the instruments on his recordings.  His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul,  synth-pop, pop, jazz, blues, and hip hop. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound.\nBorn and raised in Minneapolis, Prince signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, soon releasing the albums For You (1978) and Prince (1979). He went on to achieve critical success with the influential albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982). His sixth album, Purple Rain (1984), was recorded with his new backing band the Revolution and was also the soundtrack to the film of the same name in which he starred. Purple Rain garnered continued success for Prince and was a major commercial achievement, spending six consecutive months atop the Billboard 200 chart. The soundtrack also won Prince the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score whilst the movie grossed $70.3 million worldwide, against its $7.2 million budget and publications. Critics have regarded Purple Rain as one of the greatest musical films. After disbanding the Revolution, Prince released the album Sign o' the Times (1987), widely hailed by critics as the greatest work of his career.\nIn the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros. in 1993, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol  (known to fans as the \"Love Symbol\") and was often referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince (or TAFKAP) or simply The Artist. After moving to Arista Records in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000. Over the next decade, six of his albums entered the U.S. top 10 charts. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He was a prolific musician who released 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased material left in a custom-built bank vault underneath his home after his death, including fully completed albums and over 50 finished music videos. Numerous posthumous collections of his previously unheard work have been issued by his estate.\nPrince sold over 100 million records worldwide during his lifetime, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. His awards included the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, the Billboard Icon Award, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the U.K. Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016, and was inducted twice into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022. Estimates of the complete number of songs written by Prince range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000. Some of these songs were made popular after being covered by other musicians, most notably \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor and \"Manic Monday\" by the Bangles.", "hasanswer": true}]}

They have been widely praised by critics for creating artistic statements with their music instead of aiming for mainstream success like many of their contemporaries did. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork remarked, \"popular guitar music in 2017 has been undeniably shaped by Brand New, a band who has served not just as damaged role models but as a formative musical influence.\" Writing for The Outline, Zoe Camp stated that \"they were increasingly sincere and self-aware in a genre where emotional histrionics were the default setting.

Written and produced by Swift, Max Martin, and Shellback, \"22\" combines pop styles such as dance-pop and bubblegum with disco and 1990s rock. The track begins with an acoustic guitar riff and progresses into an upbeat refrain which incorporates pulsing synthesizers and syncopated bass drums. The lyrics celebrate being 22 years old while acknowledging the heartache that the narrator experienced in the past.\nUpon Red's release, critics complimented the production of \"22\" as catchy but some found the lyrics weak and the song repetitive. Retrospectively, some have considered it one of Swift's best pop songs. \"22\" peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It received platinum or higher certifications in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, peaking in the top 10 on the singles chart in the lattermost country. The accompanying music video was shot in Malibu, California, depicting Swift having a house party with friends. Swift included the song in the set list of the Red Tour (2013\u20132014) and the Eras Tour (2023\u20132024).

It is listed in Guinness World Records as the longest-running American soap opera in production, and the second  in American history after Guiding Light. Concurrently, it is the world's third longest-running scripted drama series in production after British serials The Archers and Coronation Street, as well as the world's second-longest-running televised soap opera still in production. General Hospital premiered on the ABC television network on April 1, 1963.  General Hospital is the longest-running serial produced in Hollywood, and the longest-running entertainment program in ABC television history. It holds the record for most Daytime Emmy Awards for Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, with 14 wins.\nThe show was created by husband-and-wife soap writers Frank and Doris Hursley, who originally set it in a hospital, in an unnamed fictional city. In the 1970s, the city was named Port Charles, New York. From its beginning, General Hospital starred John Beradino and Emily McLaughlin, and both actors stayed with the show until their deaths in 1996 and 1991, respectively. They were joined a year later by Rachel Ames who remains to date the longest serving actress on an ABC soap opera, having been continuously on the show from 1964 to 2007. General Hospital was the second soap to air on ABC (after the short-lived Road to Reality, which aired for several months during the 1960\u201361 season). In 1964, a sister soap was created for General Hospital, The Young Marrieds; it ran for two years and was canceled because of low ratings. General Hospital also spawned the daytime series Port Charles (1997\u20132003) and the primetime spin-off General Hospital: Night Shift (2007\u20132008). Taped at The Prospect Studios, General Hospital aired for a half-hour until July 23, 1976. The series was expanded from 30 minutes to 45 minutes on July 26, 1976, and then to a full hour on January 16, 1978.Ever since the late 1970s, most of the storylines have revolved around the Quartermaine family and the Spencer family. From 1979 to 1988, General Hospital had more viewers than any other daytime soap opera. It rose to the top of the ratings in the early 1980s in part thanks to the monumentally popular \"supercouple\" Luke and Laura, whose 1981 wedding brought in 30 million viewers and remains the highest-rated hour in American soap opera history. The soap opera is also known for its high-profile celebrity guest stars who have included, among others, Roseanne Barr, James Franco and Elizabeth Taylor. In 2007, the program was listed as one of Time magazine's \"100 Best TV Shows of All-Time\". On April 23, 2009, General Hospital began broadcasting in high-definition television, making it the first ABC soap opera to make such a transition.General Hospital became the oldest American soap opera on September 17, 2010, following the final broadcast of CBS's As the World Turns. On April 14, 2011, ABC announced the cancellation of both All My Children and One Life to Live, leaving General Hospital as the last remaining soap opera airing on the network after January 13, 2012.

Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows three heroes as they attempt to prevent an empire from conquering the world with the power of an ancient flying fortress.\nRather than using a turn-based battle system like contemporaneous role-playing games, Secret of Mana features real-time battles with a power bar mechanic. The game has a unique Ring Command menu system, which pauses the action and allows the player to make decisions in the middle of battle. An innovative cooperative multiplayer system allows a second or third player to drop in and out of the game at any time. Secret of Mana was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli, and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka.\nThe game received acclaim for its brightly colored graphics, expansive plot, Ring Command menu system, and innovative real-time battle system. Critics also praised Hiroki Kikuta's soundtrack and the customizable artificial intelligence (AI) settings for computer-controlled allies. Retrospectively, it has been considered one of the greatest games of all time by critics.\nThe original version was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan by Square's successor Square Enix in September 2008, and for the Wii U's Virtual Console in June 2013. The game was ported to mobile phones in Japan in 2009, and an enhanced port of the game was released for iOS in 2010 and Android in 2014.

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others. We've simply done whatever we've wanted to do, and we've all decided to be happy with the results.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_481", "question": "What genre is The Rolling Stones?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_38724", "text": "The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres into their own collective sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference to and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R&B, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music\u2014exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka\u2014as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instruments such as harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments, such as the sitar and slide guitar, in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs. According to biographer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the Stones \"pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock & roll that came to define hard rock with a \"strong yet subtly swinging rhythm\" provided by Wyman and Watts.Jagger and Richards had a shared admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf. Little Walter influenced Brian Jones. Richards recalls, \"He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's all the same shit, man, and you can do it.'\" Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair, stating in 2003, \"Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four.\" Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R&B artists, said it \"seemed the most real thing\" he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the \"most powerful music [he had] ever heard ... the most expressive\". He also recalled, \"when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters\u2014and there were a lot of us\u2014in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, [it was] very ... heartwarming\".Despite the Rolling Stones' predilection for blues and R&B numbers on their early live set lists, the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. Critic Richie Unterberger described the first Jagger/Richards single, \"Tell Me (You're Coming Back)\", as a \"pop rock ballad ... When [Jagger and Richards] began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, Mersey-type pop numbers\". \"As Tears Go By\", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and one of many written by the duo for other artists. Jagger said of the song, \"It's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time. And we didn't think of [recording] it, because the Rolling Stones were a butch blues group.\" The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US.Richards said of their early writing experiences, \"The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew [Loog Oldham], 'Well, at least we gave it a try ...'\" Jagger opined, \"We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order ... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us.\"\nThe writing of \"The Last Time\", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it \"a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it.\" The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by the Staple Singers, but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones. Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge. Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards.Beginning with Jones and continuing with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards refers to as the \"ancient art of weaving\" responsible for part of their sound\u2014the interplay between two guitarists on stage. Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards' lead rather than the drummer's. Likewise, Watts was primarily a jazz player who was able to bring that genre's influences to the style of the band's drumming. The following of Richards' lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards, and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes for a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger's production skills. In the studio the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song. Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on Beggars Banquet are driven by Nicky Hopkins' piano playing. On Exile on Main St., Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four.Richards started using open tunings for rhythm parts (often in conjunction with a capo), most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968. Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning (with the lower 6th string removed), as heard on the 1969 single \"Honky Tonk Women\", \"Brown Sugar\" (Sticky Fingers, 1971), \"Tumbling Dice\" (capo IV), \"Happy\" (capo IV), (Exile on Main St., 1972), and \"Start Me Up\" (Tattoo You, 1981).The feuds between Jagger and Richards originated in the 1970s when Richards was a heroin addict, resulting in Jagger managing the band's affairs for many years. When Richards got himself off heroin and became more present in decision-making, Jagger was not used to it and did not like having his authority diminished. This led to the period Richards has referred to as \"World War III\". Of making albums with the Stones, Richards referred to it in 2023 as \"controlled madness. Mick is the controller and I'm the madness.\"Musical collaboration between members of the band and supporting musicians was key, due to the fluid lineups typically experienced by the band in the studio, as tracks tended to be recorded \"by whatever members of the group happened to be around at the time of the sessions\". Over time, Jagger has developed into the template for rock frontmen and, with the help of the Stones, has, in the words of the Telegraph, \"changed music\" through his contributions to it as a pioneer of the modern music industry.\nStephen Hyden writes:The Rolling Stones turn 50 next year, an unprecedented milestone for a rock group and confirmation of an obvious truism: Nobody survives like the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band. Starting out as a purist blues combo that fronted a bad-boy image while recording the occasional Lennon/McCartney pop tune and string-laden ballad to help secure their popularity, the Stones deftly moved through a number of guises in the '60s and '70s while remaining essentially the same band at its core. When arena-rock reigned, the Stones became an excessive live act whose decadence was on par with Led Zeppelin; when David Bowie and glam became the hippest thing in England, Mick Jagger lathered on the mascara and campy posturing. By the time of 1978's Some Girls, the Stones absorbed the energy of New York City's punk and disco scenes so completely that it reinvigorated the band's career, spawning their final (to date) No. 1 single in the U.S., \"Miss You.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, he often has a basic melody or lyric in mind beforehand, building the layers into a full composition that can be dismantled whenever he sees fit; in his own words, this process allows the music to be more organic. Similarly, the length of compositions are dependent on feelings at the time, allowing the loops of the previous song to gradually fade out and bleed into the next song when nothing else is deemed worthy of addition. Aside from his usual combination of an acoustic guitar and loop pedals, field recordings are often used; Broughton puts their usage simply down to his love of nature and the environment.\nBroughton's voice, although distinctive, has been compared with singers such as Anohni Hegarty of Anohni and the Johnsons and Devendra Banhart. Broughton, however, insists he had never heard their music before the comparisons were made, seeing the similarities as being the likely result of people growing up with the same records. His lyrics often deal with serious, universal topics such as romance and death, though mirrored with more everyday references; one clear example can be heard on \"Weight of My Love\" from David Thomas Broughton vs. 7 Hertz, which mentions his inability to afford a pasty from Greggs bakery.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is the debut entry in the larger Xeno franchise. The gameplay of Xenogears revolves around navigating 3D environments both on-foot and using humanoid mecha dubbed \"Gears\". Combat is governed by a version of the turn-based \"Active Time Battle\" system. The story follows protagonist Fei Fong Wong and several others as they journey across the world to overthrow the all-powerful rule of Solaris and uncover mysteries concerning their world. The story incorporates Jungian psychology, Freudian thought, and religious symbolism.\nCreated by Tetsuya Takahashi and his wife Kaori Tanaka as a proposal for Final Fantasy VII, it was allowed to be developed as its own project; first as a sequel to Chrono Trigger and then as an original game with a science fiction premise. It was developed under the working title \"Project Noah\". The characters were designed by Kunihiko Tanaka, while the gears were designed by Junya Ishigaki and Yoshinori Ogura. The designs were portrayed during in-game cinematics through the use of anime cutscenes. Due to time constraints and the team's general inexperience, the second half of the game's plot was primarily told through cutscenes.\nThe game was almost not localized due to its religious content; its localization was handled by Square Electronic Arts staff and translator Richard Honeywood, who described it as one of the most troublesome games of his career. Xenogears received critical acclaim, with many calling it a work of art due to its heavy religious themes and elements of Jungian psychology. Praises particularly went towards the storyline, gameplay, characters, and psychological and religious themes, but received criticism for the rushed pace of the second disc, due to a lack of gameplay and excessive narration. By 2003, the game had shipped 1.19 million copies worldwide, gaining a cult following. While a direct sequel has not been developed, Takahashi would later found Monolith Soft and develop the Xenosaga trilogy and Xenoblade Chronicles games as spiritual successors.", "hasanswer": true}]}

In the game, the player controls a motorcycle against time and other computer-controlled bikes. It was one of the first arcade games to use 16-bit graphics and uses the Super Scaler arcade system board, created with design input from Yu Suzuki, as technology to simulate 3D effects. The deluxe cabinet version also introduced a motion-controlled arcade cabinet, where the player's body movement on a large motorbike-shaped cabinet corresponds with the player character's movements on screen.\nYu Suzuki began development of Hang-On after deciding to design a motorcycle racing game as a way to use a torsion bar in an arcade game. With market research suggesting GP 500 racing was popular, Suzuki took inspiration from world champion Freddie Spencer and his style of racing. The game's soundtrack was written by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, who used rock music that was uncommon in arcade games at the time.\nHang-On was very popular at launch and sold well for Sega, becoming the highest-grossing arcade video game of 1985 in the United States and then the highest-grossing arcade game of 1986 in both Japan and the United States. It received a positive critical reception for its realism, graphics, bike cabinet and physical controls, though there was some initial controversy in Japan over modesty concerns involving female players with the bike cabinet. The game started the trend of \"taiken\" motion simulator games in the late 1980s, which Sega followed with hits such as Space Harrier (1985), Out Run (1986), and After Burner (1987); this helped the arcade video game market recover during the late 1980s.

The recipient of numerous awards and nominations, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation. He was known for his flamboyant, androgynous persona; his wide vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams; and his skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most of the instruments on his recordings.  His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul,  synth-pop, pop, jazz, blues, and hip hop. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound.\nBorn and raised in Minneapolis, Prince signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, soon releasing the albums For You (1978) and Prince (1979). He went on to achieve critical success with the influential albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982). His sixth album, Purple Rain (1984), was recorded with his new backing band the Revolution and was also the soundtrack to the film of the same name in which he starred. Purple Rain garnered continued success for Prince and was a major commercial achievement, spending six consecutive months atop the Billboard 200 chart. The soundtrack also won Prince the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score whilst the movie grossed $70.3 million worldwide, against its $7.2 million budget and publications. Critics have regarded Purple Rain as one of the greatest musical films. After disbanding the Revolution, Prince released the album Sign o' the Times (1987), widely hailed by critics as the greatest work of his career.\nIn the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros. in 1993, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol  (known to fans as the \"Love Symbol\") and was often referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince (or TAFKAP) or simply The Artist. After moving to Arista Records in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000. Over the next decade, six of his albums entered the U.S. top 10 charts. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He was a prolific musician who released 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased material left in a custom-built bank vault underneath his home after his death, including fully completed albums and over 50 finished music videos. Numerous posthumous collections of his previously unheard work have been issued by his estate.\nPrince sold over 100 million records worldwide during his lifetime, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time.

{"id": "91_646", "question": "What genre is The Opposition?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_39386", "text": "The Opposition were a long running post-punk band from London, England. Their early recordings mixed new wave sounds with reggae rhythms. Later as a 'power trio' of Mark Long, Marcus Bell & Ralph Hall they adopted a more edgier, moody, new wave sound that featured lots of atmospheric guitar, echo & deep funky basslines.\nFounded in 1979, The Opposition gained lots of interest through gigging in the South of England. This lead to them signing for established major record label Ariola Records in early 1980. With the band sounding like a combination of the Police and the Beat an album was recorded and a single released to promote it. This Year/Punishment Of Luxury were taken from the album and became the band's debut single. However it failed to make the impact Ariola were expecting and the band were immediately dropped from the label. The album remained unreleased for 25 years until it was finally released by Right Back Records in 2005.\nThe band re-grouped and emerged as a trio with a new musical direction. Gone was the 'Two Tone' influence and saxophone, in was a more moody, heavier post-punk sound laced with synth sounds. Later in 1980 they released a track on the independent record label Double Vision Records. The Opposition had one side, Victims Of Circumstance had the other. The Opps track was \"Very Little Glory\" which the NME (New Musical Express) reviewed and said that it was \"a song recorded before its time\". Soon after the band went into the studio to record the album Breaking The Silence also on Double Vision Records. This was the first collaboration with producer Kenny Jones whose lush, powerful production would become a trademark of the bands 'power trio' sound on all their albums.\nGood reviews of the album led to the band signing to Virgin Records offshoot Charisma Records and released the Intimacy album in 1983. This album evolved the bands sound with influence from both the Chameleons and Joy Division. Two more albums, Promises in 1984 and Empire Days in 1985 followed in the next two years.\nThe band took a hiatus in 1987, when Bell and Long began working on more commercial-sounding material under the name So.  Their album, Horseshoe in the Glove, yielded a minor US hit in the song \"Are You Sure\", which, despite receiving a moderate amount of airplay on rock radio and being named an MTV \"Hip Clip of the Week\", barely missed reaching Billboard's Top 40, peaking at number 41. The song also reached number 62 in the UK Singles chart at the beginning of 1988.The Opposition then regrouped and released the album Blue Alice Blue in 1990, again recorded with Kenny Jones.\nMarcus Bell died from cancer in December 2014.

Commonly nicknamed the \"Piano Man\" after his signature 1973 song of the same name, Joel has had a successful music career as a solo artist since the 1970s.\nFrom 1971 to 1993, he released twelve studio albums that spanned the genres of pop and rock music, and in 2001 released a one-off studio album of classical music compositions. Joel is one of the world's best-selling music artists and the fourth-best-selling solo artist in the United States, with over 160 million records sold worldwide. His 1985 compilation album, Greatest Hits \u2013 Volume I & Volume II, is one of the best-selling albums in the United States.Joel was born in the Bronx in New York City and grew up on Long Island, where he began taking piano lessons at his mother's insistence. After dropping out of high school to pursue a music career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, The Hassles and Attila, before signing a record deal with Family Productions and starting off a solo career in 1971 with his first release Cold Spring Harbor. \nIn 1972, Joel caught the attention of Columbia Records after a live radio performance of the song \"Captain Jack\" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, Piano Man, in 1973. After Streetlife Serenade and Turnstiles in 1974 and 1976, respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, The Stranger, in 1977, which became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning the hit singles, \"Just the Way You Are\", \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\", \"Only the Good Die Young\", and \"She's Always a Woman\"; the album also includes the popular album track \"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\", Joel's favorite of his own songs, which has become a firm staple of his live shows, and \"Vienna\", also one of Joel's personal favorites and as of 2022 one of his most streamed songs on the internet.Joel's next album, 52nd Street, was released in 1978 and it soon became his first album to peak at No.1 on the Billboard 200 chart. Joel released his seventh studio album, Glass Houses, in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock artist; this release featured \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" (Joel's first single to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart), \"You May Be Right\", \"Don't Ask Me Why\", and \"Sometimes a Fantasy\". His next album, The Nylon Curtain, was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. An Innocent Man, released in 1983, served as an homage to genres of music that Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as rhythm and blues and doo-wop; this release featured \"Tell Her About It\", \"Uptown Girl\" and \"The Longest Time\", three of his best-known songs. After The Bridge and Storm Front in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth studio album, River of Dreams, in 1993. He went on to release Fantasies and Delusions, a 2001 album featuring classical compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist Richard Hyung-ki Joo. Joel provided voiceover work in 1988 for the Disney animated film Oliver & Company, in which he played the character Dodger with his song, \"Why Should I Worry?\", and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including Easy Money, Ruthless People, and Honeymoon in Vegas.\nAcross the years of his solo career, Joel produced 33 self-penned Top 40 hits in the U.S., three of which (\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"Tell Her About It\", and \"We Didn't Start the Fire\") topped the Billboard Hot 100. Joel has been nominated for 23 Grammy Awards, winning 6 of them, including Album of the Year for 52nd Street. Joel was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (2006). In 2001, Joel received the Johnny Mercer Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2013, Joel received the Kennedy Center Honors for influencing American culture through the arts. Since the advent of his solo career, Joel has had a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe. In 1987, he became one of the first artists to hold a rock tour in the Soviet Union following the country's alleviation of the ban on rock music. Though Joel has not released a studio album since Fantasies & Delusions, he continues to occasionally release singles, tour and perform one-off concerts.

As a teenager, he moved with his parents to C\u00f3rdoba, Veracruz, where he completed his basic education.Talavera then moved to Mexico City and joined the opera company, where he honed his vocal skills and achieved his dream of singing before large audiences opera works as Giacomo Puccini's La boh\u00e8me, that gave him the musical direction he had long coveted, although his main contribution was as a popular music songwriter rather than as an opera singer.During the decade of the 1920s, Talavera was part of several ensembles of traditional Mexican music, toured with the Orquesta T\u00edpica Presidencial, and organized and led various groups. Some of his most popular tunes include Amar en silencio, Arrullo, Bendita seas, China, El Nopal, Flor de Mayo, Jesusita la Vaquera and Muchachita m\u00eda. His most significant work at international level was Gratia Plena, with lyrics by the poet Amado Nervo, which was recorded in 1926 by the famous tenor Jos\u00e9 Mojica.In 1945 Talavera became a founding member of the SACM (Sociedad de Autores y Compositores de M\u00e9xico, for its acronym in Spanish) along with Alberto Dom\u00ednguez, Alfonso Esparza Oteo, Manuel Esper\u00f3n, Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez Esper\u00f3n, Agust\u00edn Lara and Consuelo Vel\u00e1zquez, among others.Talavera died in 1960 in Mexico City from advanced arteriosclerosis at the age of 74.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

Starting as a predominantly power/speed metal band with heavy symphonic elements, they later gravitated towards a progressive sound with an emphasis on ballads. Besides being one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label, the group is widely credited as one of the pioneers of visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam.\nOriginally named X (\u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9, Ekkusu), they released their debut album Vanishing Vision (1988) on Yoshiki's own Extasy Records one year after finalizing their line-up including bassist Taiji, lead guitarist Hide and rhythm guitarist Pata. They achieved breakthrough success in 1989 with the release of their second and major debut album Blue Blood. Following 1991's Jealousy, Taiji left the band in early 1992. He was replaced by Heath and the group changed their name to X Japan before producing the mini album Art of Life (1993), which is composed solely of the 29-minute title track. In 1995 the group dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics in favor of a more casual look and released Dahlia (1996), which like their two previous albums debuted at number one. X Japan performed their last concert at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997, making it the last of five consecutive sold-out New Year's Eve concerts the group held at the stadium.\nAfter ten years, X Japan reunited in 2007 and recorded the new song \"I.V.\". Over the next two years they performed several concerts, including their first overseas show in Hong Kong, and formally added Sugizo as lead guitarist in place of Hide, who died in 1998, before holding a North American tour in 2010. In 2011, the band went on their first world tour throughout Europe, South America and Asia. Shortly after reuniting, work began on their sixth studio album. During its ten years of production, several release dates were announced, but it remains unreleased despite Yoshiki's claim of its completion in September 2018.\nX Japan has released five studio albums, six live albums, and 21 singles. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked the band at number 40 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. In 2007, Rolling Stone Japan ranked Blue Blood number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time. In 2017, Loudwire named X Japan the Best Metal Band from Japan.

In 2006, he produced an album Songs Forever of swing and jazz versions of popular songs (including Modern Talking's first hit). Bohlen has written two autobiographical books about Modern Talking's history from his perspective. The first book sold a million copies in Germany.

Anders had not been the only one pressing charges against Bohlen and demanding that sections of the book be modified. Frank Farian was also angered by Bohlen's literary output and released a book in which he tried to expose Bohlen as a fraud.

Although recognizing the catchiness and professional production of the songs, the lack of originality was criticized by British representatives of these genres of music, such as the Pet Shop Boys or Erasure.

Controlling the player characters, the bear Banjo and the bird Kazooie, the player attempts to save Banjo's kidnapped sister Tooty from the witch Gruntilda. The player explores nine nonlinear worlds to gather items and progress. Using Banjo and Kazooie's traversal and combat abilities, they complete challenges such as solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, and defeating bosses.\nRare conceived Banjo-Kazooie as a role-playing video game, Dream, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System following the completion of Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest (1995). The 15-member team, led by Gregg Mayles, transitioned development to the Nintendo 64 and retooled the game as a platformer after the role-playing format proved too complex. Banjo-Kazooie was inspired by Super Mario 64 (1996) and designed to appeal to a broad audience, similar to Walt Disney Animation Studios films. Grant Kirkhope composed the soundtrack; Banjo-Kazooie was one of the first games to feature vertical remixing, where various sound layers fade in and out depending on the player's location. \nReleased in North America in late June 1998 and in Europe the following month, Banjo-Kazooie sold over three million copies, making it one of the bestselling Nintendo 64 games. It received acclaim from critics, who said it surpassed Super Mario 64 as the best 3D platform and adventure game. They praised the visuals, soundtrack, characters, writing, humour, and level design, but criticised the lack of originality and the camera. Banjo-Kazooie received numerous year-end accolades, including two from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences: \"Console Action Game of the Year\" and \"Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics\".\nIn retrospect, Banjo-Kazooie is considered one of Rare's best games and among the best Nintendo 64 games. It spawned a series which includes two sequels, Banjo-Tooie (2000) and Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts (2008), and two spin-offs, Grunty's Revenge (2003) and Banjo-Pilot (2005). Following Microsoft's 2002 acquisition of Rare, 4J Studios developed a port for the Xbox 360 in 2008, later included in the Xbox One compilation Rare Replay in 2015.

They are often considered to be one of the definitive alternative hip hop acts, being one of the first alternative hip hop acts to break into the mainstream. According to Forbes, their success helped establish Ruffhouse Records as a major record label. Consequence noted Fugees for putting Haiti on the hip hop map. Alternative Press argued that the group paved the way for modern alternative music and stated \"If you listen to modern hip-hop today, so many of the new faces went to the Fugees' School of Songwriting.\"While Matthew Ismael Ruiz of Pitchfork, noted the group for removing negative connotations of Haitian immigration and the word 'Refugee', stating that \"The Fugees managed to diversify the voice of the ghetto, one often depicted in a single dimension. They reclaimed pride for Haitians worldwide, a heritage maligned for its postcolonial poverty and strife but still remembered as the setting for the new world\u2019s first successful revolt of enslaved people against their oppressors. Their sound was multifaceted because they were, too, their music diverse, just like the Black experience.\" The Ringer noted that Fugees delivered political messages and brought hip hop to the mainstream in their music by blending elements of pop, soul, dancehall and Caribbean music, making it more palpable for a wider audience without making the message dense, stating \"Fugees disguised resistance as art, the same way that enslaved Africans once hid martial arts from their colonial masters by pretending that they were a dance.\"\nWriting for The Recording Academy, music journalist Kathy Iandoli wrote about the impact of the group on the hip hop genre stating: \"As hip-hop's East and West Coasts continued their tussle, their lighter-hearted approach to socially conscious rap curtailed any overarching assumptions that hip-hop was going down a \"bad road\". Plus, they had Lauryn Hill, who doubled as a songbird and lyrical spitfire. Together, by juxtaposing live instrumentation, soulful melodies and abstract bars, The Fugees gave hip-hop a renewed spirit and propelled it to a different kind of mainstream\".The group has sold over twenty-two million records worldwide, and are one of the biggest-selling hip hop groups of all time. Multiple recording artists have cited The Fugees as an influence, including Bono, Drake, Kanye West, Akon, Black Eyed Peas, Young Thug, Bridgit Mendler, Sean Kingston, Ava Max, Doja Cat, Bastille, The Kid Laroi, Post Malone, DJ Khaled, and Diplo.The impact of the Fugees has been compared to that of The Beatles, with U2's Bono calling them hip hop's version of The Beatles. Daryl McIntosh of Albumism compared the public response from the group's sophomore album, The Score to that of Beatlemania, referring to it as \"Fugee-mania\". Former United States President Barack Obama, named the Fugees single \"Ready or Not\" his favorite song ever. Their album The Score was placed on the list of 200 Definitive Albums in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (2007) by National association of recording merchandisers (NARM). \"Ready or Not\" was named among the Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll (2018) by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In the April 1989 issue of Spin Magazine, an author Michael Corcoran labelled the band as \"industrial disco\"; in 1994, writer Simon Glickman used this term as well. AllMusic's Steve Huey states that, previous to Nine Inch Nails' rise to mainstream popularity, \"Ministry did more than any other band to popularize industrial dance music, injecting large doses of punky, over-the-top aggression and roaring heavy metal guitar riffs that helped their music find favor with metal and alternative audiences outside of industrial's cult fan base.\" Despite frequent descriptions of the band's music as industrial, Jourgensen disputed the use of this tag in several publications since the early 1990s, preferring instead to identify his style as \"aggro\", and, much later \"industrious\".Despite Jourgensen's dislike of touring, Ministry are noted for their live performances, featuring extended versions of songs (as evidenced on In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up) and disturbing visual imagery. MTV also recognized the band as an influential heavy metal act, highlighting the use of sampling during their heyday. Alternative Press included Ministry in their 1996 list of 100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years, stating that they merged \"metal, samples, synths, and the 100-mph sound of urban paranoia, they pretty much created industrial music as we know it.\" Jourgensen revealed in 2008 that Ministry music is mostly on drop D and standard E tuning.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the 1980s, Can were referenced by British new wave acts such as Pete Shelley, Gary Numan, Ultravox, the Jesus and Mary Chain and Primal Scream. The Lumerians and Happy Mondays have cited Can as an influence. Critic Simon Reynolds wrote that \"Can's pan-global avant-funk anticipated many of the moves made by sampladelic dance genres like trip hop, ethnotechno and ambient jungle.\" Brian Eno made a short film in tribute to Can, while John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers appeared at the Echo Awards ceremony, at which Can were awarded the most prestigious music award in Germany.Radiohead cited Can as an influence on their albums Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). Inspired by Can, they constructed their own studio and worked by recording jams and then editing the recordings. Radiohead covered \"The Thief\" in live performances in the early 2000s. Mark E. Smith of the Fall paid tribute to Suzuki with the track \"I Am Damo Suzuki\" on the 1985 album This Nation's Saving Grace. The Jesus and Mary Chain covered \"Mushroom\" live in the mid-1980s. Mark Hollis of Talk Talk had mentioned Can several times as an influence for their later albums, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. \nAt least five notable bands have named themselves in tribute to Can: the Mooney Suzuki for Malcolm Mooney and Damo Suzuki; the indie rock band Spoon after the hit \"Spoon\"; the electronic band Egebamyasi, formed by Scottish musician Mr Egg in 1984, after Can's album Ege Bamyasi; Hunters & Collectors after a song on the Landed album; and Moonshake, named for a track on Future Days, and formed by ex-Wolfhounds frontman David Callahan. The Scottish writer Alan Warner has written two novels in tribute to two different Can members (Morvern Callar to Holger Czukay and The Man Who Walks to Michael Karoli respectively). The Sacrilege remix album features remixes of Can tracks by artists who were influenced by Can, including Sonic Youth and U.N.K.L.E. Their ethnomusicological tendencies pre-date the craze for world music in the 1980s. While not nearly as influential on electronic music as Kraftwerk, they were important early pioneers of ambient music, along with Tangerine Dream and the aforementioned band. Many groups working in the post-rock genre can look to Can as an influence as part of the larger krautrock scene, as can New Prog bands such as The Mars Volta. Rolling Stone called the group a \"pioneering space rock band\". Kanye West has sampled \"Sing Swan Song\" on his song \"Drunk & Hot Girls\" from his 2007 album Graduation. The UK band Loop was deeply influenced by Can for their repetitive polyrhythmic style, covering Can's \"Mother Sky\" on their Black Sun EP. The Yugoslav progressive/psychedelic rock band Igra Staklenih Perli, heavily influenced by Can, on their self-titled debut album released the song \"Pe\u010durka\" (\"Mushroom\") as a tribute to Can.The band is name-checked as a formative influence in LCD Soundsystem's debut single \"Losing My Edge\".

Super Circuit includes various single-player and multiplayer game modes, including a Grand Prix racing mode and a last man standing battle mode.\nSuper Circuit was developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo.

The cover is made of aluminium, spiral bound and wrapped in a Mylar sheet.\nMadonna's publishers were apprehensive about the release and the book's commercial potential. It was released on October 21, 1992, the day after Madonna's fifth studio album Erotica. A CD single was also packaged with the book which contained the song \"Erotic\", a song similar in composition to her similarly-named single \"Erotica\". It sold over 150,000 copies on its first day in the United States, and topped the New York Times Best Seller list for three weeks. In matters of days, Sex went on to sell more than 1.5 million copies worldwide and remains the best and fastest-selling coffee table book. It also remains as one of the most in-demand out-of-print publications of all time.\nSex attracted extensive media attention and backlash, but Madonna remained unapologetic. Though it initially received negative reviews from fans and critics, who felt she had \"gone too far\", later reviews have been more positive, with academics deeming it a defining phase in Madonna's career. Sex is noted for its social and cultural impact and is considered a bold post-feminist work.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Vocalist Steve Gadd (born Stephen Gadd, 27 April 1952, Shepherd's Bush, West London), guitarist Del Bromham (born Derek Roy Bromham, 25 November 1951, Acton, West London), bassist Gary Giles (born Gary Stephen Giles, 23 February 1952, North Kensington, West London) and drummer Steve Crutchley (born 1952) formed the band whilst all were attending the Christopher Wren School in London. Richard \"Ritchie\" Cole (born 10 November 1951, Shepherd's Bush, West London) replaced Crutchley in 1968. They signed to Transatlantic Records in January 1970.\nTheir brand of melodic, hook-laden hard rock proved to be a popular draw on the local club scene during the early 1970s. However, the band never achieved commercial success. At one stage Charlie Kray (brother of the Kray twins Ronnie and Reggie), was their manager. Gadd left the band in 1975 due to artistic differences and was replaced on vocals by Pete Dyer. The group's early musical style consisted of blues rock, acid rock and psychedelic rock. They then went on to join the hard rock and progressive rock movement.The band served as the rhythm section alongside a string orchestra for the 1975 Jimmy Helms LP, Songs I Sing. The original Stray ended in 1977, although Bromham later continued to play in various resurrected versions of the project well into the 2000s. By the 2010s the band had a settled lineup again, as well as Del Bromham, Pete Dyer returned and Stuart Uren (bass) and Karl Randall (drums) were regularly gigging as Stray. In November 2016, the band hosted a 50th Anniversary celebration concert (featuring all original members) at a sold-out London Borderline.\nIn 2019, Colin Kempster replaced Stuart Uren as permanent bassist and, for live gigs, the band was also joined by Simon Rinaldo on keyboards.  After successful concerts in late 2019 and an acclaimed set at the annual Giants of Rock Festival in Minehead, Stray set out on a full joint headlining tour with Ken Pustelnik\u2019s Groundhogs in February and March in 2020.\nIn 2003, Stray were the support band to Iron Maiden on several of their European dates on the Dance of Death World Tour 2003-2004. These included dates in Spain, Portugal, Poland and France. There are two other Iron Maiden connections to Stray. \"All in Your Mind\" from Stray's 1970 debut album was covered by Iron Maiden and was included on the 1995 reissue of No Prayer for the Dying, and Maiden bassist Steve Harris's daughter Lauren has covered \"Come On Over\".\nFrom late 2006 until early 2007, the band's back catalogue of eight studio albums issued originally during the 1970s, were re-released by the UK based Sanctuary Records in compact disc format.

It stars Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker, Marg Helgenberger, and Natasha Henstridge in her film debut role. The film's plot concerns a motley crew of scientists and government agents who try to track down Sil (Henstridge), a seductive extraterrestrial-human hybrid, before she successfully mates with a human male.\nThe film was conceived by Feldman in 1987, and was originally pitched as a film treatment in the style of a police procedural, entitled The Message. When The Message failed to attract the studios, Feldman re-wrote it as a spec script, which ultimately led to the making of the film. The extraterrestrial aspect of Sil's character was created by H. R. Giger, who was also responsible for the beings from the Alien franchise. The effects combined practical models designed by Giger collaborator Steve Johnson and XFX, with computer-generated imagery done by Richard Edlund's Boss Film Studios. Giger felt that the film and the character were too similar to Alien, so he pushed for script changes.\nMost of the principal photography was done in Los Angeles, California, where the film is set. Several scenes were filmed in Utah and at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Species was met with mixed reviews from critics, who felt that the film's execution did not match the ambition of its premise, but nevertheless was a box office success, partly due to the hype surrounding Henstridge's nude scenes in various tabloid newspapers and lad mags of the time, grossing US$113.3 million ($227 million in 2023 dollars). It spawned a franchise, which includes one theatrical sequel (Species II), as well as two direct-to-television sequels (Species III and Species: The Awakening).

Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself.\nFeaturing West Coast hip hop, G-funk and horrorcore musical styles, the majority of The Slim Shady LP's lyrical content is written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego, named Slim Shady, whom he created on the Slim Shady EP (1997). The Slim Shady LP contains cartoonish depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, which Eminem described as horror film-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of the lyrics on the album are considered to be satirical, Eminem also depicts his frustrations of living in poverty.\nThe Slim Shady LP debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, just below TLC's FanMail, and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It was a critical and commercial success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, dark humor lyrics, and unusual personality. The first single, \"My Name Is\", became Eminem's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won Best Rap Album at the 2000 Grammy Awards, while \"My Name Is\" won Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2000, The Slim Shady LP was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is often mentioned in lists of the greatest albums of all time. While The Slim Shady LP's success turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on U.S. youth.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Best known for writing solo classical guitar music, he also composed an opera (at the age of 19), three symphonies, guitar duos, piano music, songs, a Mass, and at least two successful ballets: Cinderella, which received over one hundred performances, and Hercule et Omphale.\nPartly because Sor was himself such a classical guitar virtuoso\u2014contemporaries considered him to be the best in the world\u2014he made a point of writing didactic music for players of that instrument of all levels. His Twelve Studies Op. 6, the Twelve Studies Op. 29, the (24) Progressive Lessons Op. 31, and the (24) Very Easy Exercises Op. 35 have been widely played for two hundred years and are regularly reprinted. On the other hand, some of Sor's music, not least his popular Introduction and Variations on Mozart's \"Das klinget so herrlich\" Op. 9, is fiendishly difficult.\nUnlike modern classical guitar players, Sor used the smaller, slimmer \"Romantic\" guitars predating today's familiar Torres instrument.

Their universe is presented in media such as music videos, interviews, comic strips and short cartoons. Gorillaz's music has featured collaborations with a wide range of featured artists, with Albarn as the only permanent musical contributor.\nWith Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct Britpop sound of his band Blur, exploring a variety of musical styles including hip hop, electronic and world music. The band's 2001 debut album, Gorillaz, which features dub, Latin and punk influences, went triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in Europe, with sales driven by the success of the lead single, \"Clint Eastwood\". Their second studio album, Demon Days (2005), went six times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US and spawned the successful lead single \"Feel Good Inc.\" The band's third album, Plastic Beach (2010), featured environmentalist themes, synth-pop elements and an expanded roster of featured artists. Their fourth album, The Fall, was recorded on the road during the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour and released on 25 December 2010.\nIn 2015, after over 10 years providing the voice of Russel, Remi Kabaka Jr. became a permanent music producer for the band. Their fifth album, Humanz (2017) was the band's first in seven years and featured a wide array of guest artists, while its follow-up, The Now Now (2018), focused musically on Albarn. In 2020, Gorillaz started the Song Machine project, a music-based web series with episodes that consisted of standalone singles and accompanying music videos featuring different guests, which culminated with their seventh studio album, Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez (2020).

They have won a Grammy Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award and four MTV Europe Music Awards.
