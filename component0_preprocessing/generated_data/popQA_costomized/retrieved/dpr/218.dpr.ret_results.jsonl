He is regarded as one of the most prominent artists in R&B music, being credited as an evolver of the genre, and often being referred to by contemporaries as the \"King of R&B\". His R&B has been characterized by several influences from other genres, mainly pop music and hip hop. His lyrics develop predominantly over emotional and hedonistic themes. Brown has had wide comparisons to Michael Jackson for his singing and dancing abilities.In 2004, Brown signed with Jive Records and released his eponymous debut studio album the following year, which was later certified triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). With his debut single \"Run It!\" (featuring Juelz Santana) peaking atop the Billboard Hot 100, Brown became the first male artist since 1995 to have his debut single top the chart. His second album, Exclusive (2007), was met with further commercial success worldwide, and spawned his second Billboard Hot 100 number one \"Kiss Kiss\" (featuring T-Pain). In 2009, Brown received much media attention after pleading guilty to felony assault of his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna; he was sentenced to five years of probation and six months of community service, with his personal life and legal issues being highly publicized by media outlets in the following years. This foresaw the release of his third album, Graffiti which was considered to be a commercial failure compared to his previous works. Following Graffiti, Brown released his fourth album F.A.M.E. (2011), which became his first album to top the Billboard 200. The album contained the commercially successful singles: \"Yeah 3x\", \"Look at Me Now\" (featuring Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes) and \"Beautiful People\" (featuring Benny Benassi), and earned him the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album. His fifth album, Fortune, released in 2012, also topped the Billboard 200.\nFollowing the releases of X (2014) and Royalty (2015), both peaking in the top three of the Billboard 200, his eighth album, Heartbreak on a Full Moon, a double-disc LP consisting of 45 tracks, was certified Gold by the RIAA for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 after one week, and was later certified double Platinum. Brown's ninth studio album, Indigo (2019) found similar success, debuting atop the Billboard 200. It included the single \"No Guidance\" (featuring Drake) which broke the record for the longest-running number one on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. Its chart success was outdone with the single \"Go Crazy\" (with Young Thug) released the following year, which broke Brown's own record for the longest-running number one on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart set previously by \"No Guidance\". In 2022, his Indigo album spawned a sleeper hit with its song \"Under the Influence\", which was re-released as a single.Brown has sold over 140 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He's gained a cult following, and is one of the highest-grossing African American touring artists of all time. In terms of charts and certifications, Brown holds the record for the most Billboard Hot 100 entries of any male singer in history, the most top 40 hits of any R&B singer in history, the most RIAA Gold-certified singles of any male singer in history, and the most RIAA multi-Platinum singles of any male singer in history. At the end of 2019, Billboard named Brown the third most successful artist of the 2010s decade in R&B and hip-hop music, behind Drake and Rihanna in first and second, respectively. Additionally, Brown has won a total of 199 awards from 513 nominations over the course of his career. Brown has also pursued an acting career. In 2007, he made his on-screen feature film debut in Stomp the Yard, and appeared as a guest on the television series The O.C. Other films Brown has appeared in include This Christmas (2007), Takers (2010), Think Like a Man (2012), Battle of the Year (2013) and She Ball (2021).", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "218_152", "question": "In what city was Batman born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "218_3336", "text": "Batman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha as a child, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker.\nKane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although Kane frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something more bat-like. The character received his own spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.\nDC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as Vertigo and Black Label. The longest-running Batman comic, Detective Comics, is the longest-running comic book in the United States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder Woman, as a member of organizations such as the Justice League and the Outsiders. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters have taken on the Batman persona on different occasions, such as Jean-Paul Valley / Azrael in the 1993\u20131994 \"Knightfall\" story arc; Dick Grayson, the first Robin, from 2009 to 2011; and Jace Fox, son of Wayne's ally Lucius, as of 2021. DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of Batman, including the incarnation seen in The Dark Knight Returns and its successors, the incarnation from the Flashpoint (2011) event, and numerous interpretations from Elseworlds stories.\nOne of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Batman has been listed among the greatest comic book superheroes and fictional characters ever created. He is one of the most commercially successful superheroes, and his likeness has been licensed and featured in various media and merchandise sold around the world; this includes toy lines such as Lego Batman and video games like the Batman: Arkham series. Batman has been adapted in live-action and animated incarnations, including the 1960s Batman television series played by Adam West and in film by Michael Keaton in Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992), and The Flash (2023), Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995), George Clooney in Batman & Robin (1997), Christian Bale in The Dark Knight trilogy (2005\u20132012), Ben Affleck in the DC Extended Universe (2016\u20132023), and Robert Pattinson in The Batman (2022).

He initially attended Hamline University, but graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1902, followed by William Mitchell College of Law (then the St. Paul College of Law) in 1904. Three years later, he was blinded by an electrical shock from a cigar lighter.Schall was elected to the House of Representatives in 1914 and served from March 4, 1915, to March 3, 1925, in the 64th, 65th, 66th, 67th, and 68th congresses. As he was legally blind, he was granted, by House vote, a full-time page to assist him with his work.After losing the Republican primary for a special election to the Senate in 1923, Schall was elected to the Senate in 1924, defeating Magnus Johnson with 46% of the vote. He served from March 4, 1925, until his death, in the 69th, 70th, 71st, 72nd, and 73rd congresses. Johnson would challenge Schall's election, leading the blind Senator to infamously label him \"a marionette who kicked and waved his hands and opened his mouth according to the tension of the string.\" He had a tough re-election campaign in 1930, facing strong candidates from both the Democratic and Farmer Labor parties, and eventually won with 37% of the vote with the support of the NAACP owing to support of the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill.\nLong noted as a vitriolic and personal campaigner, Schall would emerge as a leading opponent of the New Deal, going so far as to compare Franklin D. Roosevelt to Satan and claim his reform program was communistic in nature. Going further, Schall would accuse Eleanor Roosevelt of corruption and liken President Roosevelt to Mussolini and Hitler, while at the same time accusing him of plotting \"the destruction of all private industry.\"Schall was struck by a hit and run driver while walking across the Washington-Baltimore Boulevard, now known as Bladensburg Road, in Cottage City, Maryland, on December 19, 1935.

Her birthplace is about five miles (8 km) east of North Star. There is a stone-mounted plaque in the vicinity of the site, which was placed by the Annie Oakley Committee in 1981, 121 years after her birth.\nAnnie's parents were Quakers of English descent from Hollidaysburg, Blair County, Pennsylvania: Susan Wise, born 1830, and Jacob Mosey, born 1799, married in 1848. They moved to a rented farm (later purchased with a mortgage) in Patterson Township, Darke County, Ohio, sometime around 1855.\nBorn in 1860, Annie was the sixth of Jacob and Susan's nine children, and the fifth of the seven surviving. Her siblings were Mary Jane (1851\u20131867), Lydia (1852\u20131882), Elizabeth (1855\u20131881), Sarah Ellen (1857\u20131939), Catherine (1859\u20131859), John (1861\u20131949), Hulda (1864\u20131934) and a stillborn infant brother in 1865. Annie's father, who had fought in the War of 1812, was 61 years old at the time of Annie's birth and became an invalid from hypothermia during a blizzard in late 1865 and died of pneumonia in early 1866 at age 66. Her mother later married Daniel Brumbaugh, had another daughter, Emily (1868\u20131937), and was widowed once again.\nBecause of poverty following her father's death, Annie did not regularly attend school as a child, although she did attend later in childhood and in adulthood. On March 15, 1870, at age nine, she was admitted to the Darke County Infirmary along with her sister Sarah Ellen. According to her autobiography, she was put in the care of the infirmary's superintendent, Samuel Crawford Edington, and his wife Nancy, who taught her to sew and decorate. Beginning in the spring of 1870, she was \"bound out\" to a local family to help care for their infant son, on the false promise of fifty cents per week (equivalent to $12 in 2023) and an education. The couple had originally wanted someone who could pump water and cook and who was bigger. She spent about two years in near slavery to them, enduring mental and physical abuse. One time, the wife put Annie out in the freezing cold without shoes, as a punishment because she had fallen asleep over some darning. Annie referred to them as \"the wolves\". Even in her autobiography, she never revealed the couple's real names.According to biographer Glenda Riley, \"the wolves\" could have been the Studabaker family, but the 1870 U.S. Census suggests they were the Abram Boose family of neighboring Preble County. Around the spring of 1872, Annie ran away from \"the wolves\". According to biographer Shirl Kasper, it was only at this point that Annie met and lived with the Edingtons, returning to her mother's home around the age of 15.Annie began trapping before age 7, and shooting and hunting by age 8, to support her siblings and her widowed mother. She sold hunted game to locals in Greenville, such as shopkeepers Charles and G. Anthony Katzenberger, who shipped it to hotels in Cincinnati and other cities. She also sold the game to restaurants and hotels in northern Ohio. Her skill paid off the mortgage on her mother's farm when Annie was 15.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Born to a wealthy Quaker family, he distinguished himself as a child prodigy interested in science, publishing his first scientific paper at the age of 19. Though his father tried to raise Cope as a gentleman farmer, he eventually acquiesced to his son's scientific aspirations.\nCope had little formal scientific training, and he eschewed a teaching position for field work. He made regular trips to the American West, prospecting in the 1870s and 1880s, often as a member of U.S. Geological Survey teams. A personal feud between Cope and paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh led to a period of intense fossil-finding competition now known as the Bone Wars. Cope's financial fortunes soured after failed mining ventures in the 1880s, forcing him to sell off much of his fossil collection. He experienced a resurgence in his career toward the end of his life before dying on April 12, 1897.\nThough Cope's scientific pursuits nearly bankrupted him, his contributions helped to define the field of American paleontology. He was a prodigious writer with 1,400 papers published over his lifetime, although his rivals debated the accuracy of his rapidly published works. He discovered, described, and named more than 1,000 vertebrate species, including hundreds of fishes and dozens of dinosaurs.

From Perth, Western Australia, Strauss attended Perth Modern School and later the University of Western Australia, playing for the university's hockey club. Twice named captain of the all-Australian universities side, he was captain of the side on several occasions, including when the team shared the 1952 Syme Cup with the University of Adelaide. Strauss represented Western Australia on various occasions from 1949 to 1955, and made his Test debut for the Australian national team in August 1954, against New Zealand (with cricket teammate Ian Dick captaining the side), though it is unclear if he played further matches for the national side. At both club and state levels, he had largely played as a defender, usually as a fullback, and was known for his \"interceptions and long clearances\".Playing first for East Perth and then University at WACA district level, Strauss had played cricket matches for state colts teams as early as the 1950\u201351 season, but did not make his first-class debut for the state's senior team until the end of the 1952\u201353 season, playing for the state against the touring Australian and South African national teams. Opening the bowling with Harry Price against the South Africans, he took 7/75 in the side's second innings, although Western Australia still lost the match by 175 runs. A regular in the side throughout the remainder of the 1950s, Strauss took 25 wickets in a season on three separate occasions (1956\u201357, 1958\u201359, and 1959\u201360), often partnering with Des Hoare and Ron Gaunt. His best bowling figures came during the 1956\u201357 season in the opening Sheffield Shield match against South Australia, when he took 7/59 from 18 eight-ball overs. He finished that season with 33 wickets at an average of 22.48, the most of any fast bowler and second only to Victoria's Lindsay Kline (37 wickets) overall.Having played his last matches for Western Australia during the 1959\u201360 season, Strauss spent both the 1960 and 1961 English seasons as the professional player for the East Lancashire Cricket Club in the Lancashire League, playing 52 league and seven cup matches over the two seasons. East Lancashire made the final of the Worsley Cup (the league's knockout competition) in both seasons, winning in 1961. Strauss took five-wicket hauls in both years, as well as scoring a half-century in the 1960 loss. However, his performance in that match was largely overshadowed by that of Burnley's professional, Indian Test player Dattu Phadkar, who took 8/54 and scored 68 not out. In league matches, Strauss took the most wickets for the club in both seasons, as well as leading the club's runs aggregates in the 1960 season. His 104 wickets during that season was only bettered by West Indies international Roy Gilchrist. He finished his first-class career with 139 wickets from 37 matches.\nStrauss died in Perth in July 2013, aged 85.", "hasanswer": true}]}

According to Venator, Tishem was a remarkably erudite woman, fluent in Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and English and able to read Galen's original text.\nIn 1558 in Antwerp, Tishem married a widowed and wealthy merchant and juror, Wouter Gruter (also \"Walterus\", \"de Gruytere\", etc.), originally from Breda.

Her husband co-signed the Compromise of Nobles in 1566, and to flee prosecution in the Spanish Netherlands, they moved to the Dutch Calvinist exile community of Norwich.

Joannes' baptism is recorded in the Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam on 25 January 1626.  He was described (by Gerbrand van den Eeckhout) as a self-taught artist, but probably received some form of training from Simon de Vlieger, whose style he copied or is closest to his early paintings, and perhaps other masters such as Willem van de Velde the Elder. He received the citizenship of Amsterdam on 24 July 1653, an essentially honorific ceremony for one of the city elite. A few months before, on 2 February 1653, he had married Annetje Jansdr. Grotingh, the daughter of a bricklayer. \nVan de Cappelle was a very wealthy man who never needed to rely on his painting for his livelihood, and it is not known if he joined the city's Guild of Saint Luke, or the separate \"brotherhood of painters\" founded in 1653. Whether he sold his work, or how he did so, is unclear.\n\nAbraham Bredius suggested Van de Cappelle was a friend of Rembrandt, at whose insolvency sales in 1656 and 1658 he was a large buyer, and who painted portraits of him and his wife. It has been speculated that he may have used his business contacts to help obtain the commission for Rembrandt's last, and financially very useful, group portrait commission, the Syndics of the Drapers' Guild of 1662.His earliest dated painting is an important and already highly accomplished one from 1645, and only one is dated in the 1660s. From this most authors assume he devoted his later years to his business, in which his brother Franchois also worked.  In May 1661 he bought a house in the Koestraat, near Nieuwmarkt, moving from the even more expensive Keizersgracht. The house with a garden, next to a school, was sold by a son  of Sweelinck, and in the deed of purchase van de Cappelle is simply called schilder (painter) and not a master painter.His wife predeceased him in 1677, and van de Cappelle himself was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk on 22 December 1679. He left seven children.  The inventory of his property at death has survived and is the main source of information about his impressive art collection. It took seven months to list all.  He left his children six houses, a country house south of Loenen on the river Vecht (Utrecht), a pleasure yacht, \"44 bags of ducats\", silk and bonds together valued at 92,720 guilders.

Originally from Maine, he also served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, losing an arm, and served in Florida's 1868 constitutional convention and in the Florida House of Representatives, including time as speaker.\nBorn in Lovell in Oxford County in southwestern Maine, he attended Waterville College in Waterville, Maine (which later became Colby College). In 1861, he joined the Union Army and lost an arm during the Battle of Opequon in Winchester, Virginia, after which the Army sent him to study law.

Boddingh of Haarlem and Magdalena Heyns of Antwerp. He adopted the surname van Laer only later in life.  This surname was probably taken from his brother's godfather. He came from a well to do family and his parents operated a private school in Haarlem started by Magdalena's father, the well-known writer and publisher Peeter Heyns, after whom Pieter van Laer was named.\n\nHis older brother was Roedolff van Laer, who also became a painter and was known as Roeland van Laer and Orlando van Laer. His youngest brother Nicolaes Bodding became known later in life as Nicolaes Boddingius and was a prominent schoolmaster and minister.  He also had two sisters called Barbara and AnthoynettaPieter van Laer was possibly a pupil of Esaias van de Velde in Haarlem. His early work shows the influence of this painter as is evidenced by a drawing signed Pieter Bodink (formerly in the collection of A. Welcker), which is close to van de Velde's style. He traveled to Rome in 1625 via France, likely in the company of his brother Roeland.  In 1626 their father is also recorded in Rome as a witness to a will. Here he became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mostly Flemish and Dutch artists in Rome who were known for their initiation rituals, which involved a lot of drinking.  Pieter van Laer's nickname in Italy was Il Bamboccio, which means \"ugly doll\" or \"puppet\". This was an allusion to van Laer's ungainly appearance, as he is said to have had unusually long legs, short chest and almost no neck.  Pieter van Laer was also known for his pointed moustache.  Van Laer shared a home in the Via Margutta with Jean Ducamps, whose pupil he is said to have been according to certain art historians. However, such apprenticeship is unlikely since the two artists had approximately the same age.  He was also a close friend of Joachim von Sandrart in Rome.\nThrough the works he created in Rome Pieter van Laer initiated a new style of genre painting.  Paintings in this new style were named Bambocciate after his nickname.  He became the inspiration and focal point around which likeminded artists congregated during his stay in Italy. The initial Bamboccianti included Jan Miel, Andries and Jan Both, Karel Dujardin, Johannes Lingelbach and the Italian Michelangelo Cerquozzi.  The Frenchman S\u00e9bastien Bourdon was also associated with this group during his early career. Other Bamboccianti include Michiel Sweerts, Thomas Wijck, Dirck Helmbreker, Jan Asselyn, Anton Goubau, Willem Reuter, Jacob van Staverden and Johan Filip Lemke.Pieter van Laer had a successful career in Rome.  He returned to the Netherlands c. 1639.  Here he lived chiefly in Amsterdam and later in Haarlem with his younger brother Nicolaes.  The date, place and cause of van Laer's death are unknown.  It must have occurred after 1641 when he is known to have made a drawing in a Haarlem song book. It is believed he travelled back to Italy around that time.  According to a statement in the testament of his sister made in 1654 there had not been any signs of life from Pieter van Laer in the previous 12 years.  The Italian biographer Giovanni Battista Passeri stated that van Laer died in the fall of 1642.  The Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken reported that van Laer became depressed at the end of his life and committed suicide by drowning.", "hasanswer": false}]}

By the age of seventeen, she had begun her studies at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome with Edwige Chibaudo, and later with Rinolfi and Pedreni. Due to her wide vocal range, she was initially thought to be a soprano.\nShe made her debut in Cagliari as Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana in 1934.  Within a year, she joined the Teatro alla Scala in Milan as Meg Page in Verdi's Falstaff. Soon she was given the part of Azucena in Il trovatore, which quickly became her signature role and was her debut role at the Metropolitan Opera in 1947. Other roles there included Santuzza, Ulrica in Un ballo in maschera, Mrs Quickly in Falstaff \u2014 the latter she recorded in 1950, opposite Giuseppe Valdengo \u2014 and Herva Nelli, with Arturo Toscanini conducting.\nShe sang Wagnerian roles in Italian, as was the custom during this time period, including Brangaene at La Scala to the Isolde of Giuseppina Cobelli, and Ortrud. She made a notable recording (singing in Italian) of Brangaene's watch from Act 2.\nShe made recordings (also in Italian) of lieder by Brahms and Strauss. She also recorded discs of duets from La Gioconda, Aida, and Adriana Lecouvreur with the dramatic soprano Gina Cigna, which reveal both her powerful voice and passionate temperament.\nShe returned to Italy after her tenure at the Metropolitan opera (her career there was not as successful as she had hoped), and she sang at La Scala until 1954 when she abandoned her stage career. By that time, the top notes in her voice had disintegrated. She accepted a teaching position in Ankara, where she remained until her death in 1962.", "hasanswer": true}]}

As a young man, Willard moved to Wellington, Ohio and began working for wagon maker E.S. Tripp. He began as a basic wagon painter, but eventually was allowed to paint elaborate decorations that were popular at the time. Willard joined the 86th Ohio Infantry Regiment in 1863 and fought in the Civil War, but was not heavily involved. During this time, he painted several scenes from the war.\nAfter the war, Willard created a pair of paintings for Tripp's daughter, Addie, called Pluck and Pluck No. 2. The first of the two features three children being carted by a dog chasing a rabbit, while in the second, the children and their cart have crashed due to their reckless pursuit. These paintings, among earlier sketches, forged a relationship between him and photographer James F. Ryder. Ryder made much of his money in chromolithography, printing popular and marketable images for the average household. He saw a potential in Willard to create humorous and cheerful paintings to make profits.Willard painted The Spirit of '76 about 1875 in Wellington, Ohio after he saw a holiday parade pass through the town square. Willard also painted three murals in the main hall of the Fayette County courthouse in Washington Court House, Ohio: The Spirit of Electricity, The Spirit of Telegraphy, and The Spirit of the Mail.\nWillard is buried in Wellington, Ohio at the Greenwood Cemetery.
